## Introduction

Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC), marketed under the trade names Xyntha in the United States and ReFacto AF in  Europe,  is  a  recombinant  factor  VIII  (FVIII)  product  for  use  in  the  treatment  of  subjects  with hemophilia A (congenital FVIII deficiency).  It is produced using a modification of the previous process used for manufacture of its predecessor product (ReFacto) that eliminates the addition of all humanand animal-derived proteins.

The MAH has in accordance with article 46 of the paediatric regulation 1901/2006 submitted the study 3082B2-4418 (B1831003).

For  the  purpose  of  post-authorization  safety  surveillance,  this  study  monitored  development  of clinically  relevant  and  laboratory-confirmed  inhibitors  in  a  population  of  subjects  with  hemophilia A, who after consultation with their physician, chose to be treated with Xyntha independent of this study. The study was discontinued because the Sponsor has ongoing studies collecting similar safety data.

## Study 3082B2-4418 (B1831003)

This was a nonrandomized, single treatment and prospective open-label study to evaluate the overall safety of Xyntha in subjects transitioning from ReFacto or other FVIII replacement products to Xyntha in  usual  care  settings.    Although  the  original  protocol  was  designed  to  include  only  subjects transitioning from ReFacto or other FVIII, Amendment 3 allowed enrollment of subjects who had more than 5 EDs to Xyntha prior to enrollment.  The study was conducted at 1 center in New Zealand and 4 centers in the United States.

The study had both observational and active safety surveillance components for assessment.  During the active safety surveillance phase, FVIII inhibitor and FVIII recovery studies were performed at each visit.  For the observational safety surveillance phase, subjects were treated under standard care with Xyntha at a dose and frequency prescribed by the treating physician, for up to 2 years. No efficacy data was collected.

Only previously treated male subjects, 12 years of age and older, with &gt;150 EDs to any recombinant or plasma-derived FVIII products were eligible to enroll, as per the recommendations from regulatory authorities and scientific advisory committees for the evaluation of FVIII inhibitor development.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate FVIII inhibitor development, defined as an inhibitor titer of ≥ 0.6 Bethesda Unit (BU) using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay and confirmed by the central laboratory, in subjects treated with Xyntha in usual use.

The  secondary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  overall  safety  of  Xyntha  in  this  subject population.

Safety was assessed through the collection of nonserious adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events  (SAEs)  as  well  as  the  incidence  of  less-than-expected  therapeutic  effect  (LETE).    Events  of special circumstances (eg, inhibitor development and LETE) were reported in the same time frame as SAEs.

## Overview of Safety results

Twelve (12) of the 14 subjects who signed informed consent were enrolled and treated with Xyntha. All subjects were male.  Ages ranged from 13 to 56 years; 3 subjects were aged less than 18 years (ie, 13, 14, and 15 years).  Three (25%) subjects (1 pediatric) completed the study before the study was discontinued by the Sponsor; 8 (67%) subjects did not complete because of the study closure and 1 subject (aged 14 years) withdrew at his own request.

For  the  12  subjects  included  in  this  report,  the  treatment  regimen  was  on  demand  for  6 subjects (including  1  pediatric  subject),  primary  prophylaxis  for  3  subjects  (including  2 pediatric  subjects), secondary  prophylaxis  for  2  subjects,  and  preventive  regimen  for  1 subject.    The  cumulative  total exposure for the 12 subjects was 1097 EDs (mean 91, median 71, range 16 to 342 days).  Exposure for pediatric subjects was 18, 48, and 342 EDs.

Overall, 9 (75.0%) subjects had at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) during the study. The  system  organ  classes  with  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  gastrointestinal  disorders (58.3%  subjects);  injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications  (50.0%  subjects);  infections  and infestations (33.3% subjects); musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (33.3% subjects); and general disorders and administration site (25.0% subjects).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most frequently reported TEAEs  were arthralgia and nausea (each in 3 [25.0%]  subjects); and vomiting  (2  [16.7%]  subjects).    The  majority  of  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.    TEAEs considered to be severe were reported for 4 subjects.  None of the AEs led to a subject's withdrawal from the study.

Two (2) subjects each had an SAE:  one case of therapeutic response decreased (LETE) was moderate in severity and was the only TEAE in the study that was considered to be treatment related; a case of tooth impacted was considered to be severe.  Both SAEs resolved and no action was taken with the study drug due to the events.

No  local  laboratory  results  0.6  BU  were  reported;  therefore,  no  positive  cases  from  the  central laboratory of FVIII inhibitor development were analyzed or reported.

Of the 3 paediatric subjects, diarrhea, vomiting, and arthralgia were reported for 1 subject; sinusitis, head injury, and nausea for a second subject; and no TEAEs were reported for the third subject.  All of these TEAEs were mild and resolved.  None were SAEs.

## Conclusions of the MAH

No occurrences  of  FVIII  inhibitor  development  were  observed  during  this  study,  and  no  new  safety risks  or  concerns were identified.  Xyntha was safe and well tolerated during the study as assessed through the collection of nonserious AEs and SAEs as well as the incidence of LETE.  The study was discontinued because the Sponsor has ongoing studies collecting similar safety data

## Conclusion of the Rapporteur

The MAH has submitted the results from an open label study evaluating the overall safety of Xyntha in subjects  transitioning  from  ReFacto  or  other  FVIII  replacement  products  to  Xyntha  in  usual  care setting. Twelve male subjects, ages ranging from 13 to 56 years with 3 subjects aged less than 18 years (i.e., 13, 14, and 15) received the Refacto AF version approved in US and the study took place outside Europe.

The  collected  safety  data  did  not  reveal  any  new  adverse  events  and  no  reports  of  inhibitors  were obtained. As the study also is terminated by the sponsor no more data is expected.

Being a small study with limited information it is somewhat difficult to make any definitive conclusions but based on the information and reports provided it is considered that the study results do not affect the currently approved SmPC for Refacto AF in the EU nor does it change the overall benefit/risk.
