| A31/0017 | On 17 April 2013, further to the emergence of new evidence from the scientific literature on dual RAS blockade therapy and given the seriousness of the identified safety concerns, the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) initiated a review under Article 31 of Council Directive 2001/83/EC, requesting the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) to issue a recommendation on the benefit- risk of dual RAS blockade therapy through the combined use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or aliskiren and to determine whether any regulatory measures should be taken on the marketing authorisations of the products involved in this procedure. | 22/05/2014 | 04/09/2014 | SmPC and PL | For further information please refer to the Renin- angiotensin-system (RAS)-acting agents Article 31 referral - Assessment report. |

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 14/04/2011 | 14/06/2011 | SmPC and PL | In this type II variation application (C.I.4), the MAH has updated section 4.5 of the Twynsta Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) regarding an interaction between amlodipine and grapefruit, in line with the Norvasc's SmPC (originator for Amlodipine). Consequential changes to the Package Leaflet have been made. The available data are consistent with the assumption that the potential interaction between amlodipine and grapefruit juice may be less pronounced than with other calcium channel blockers. The point estimate for changes in AUC and Cmax values were between 107 and 116% in the published studies. There were no significant changes in blood pressure values in healthy volunteers when concomitant intake of grapefruit juice was compared to concomitant intake of water. Minor differences were observed in standing pulse. Considering the interindividual differences in bioavailability and the lack of data in patients |
