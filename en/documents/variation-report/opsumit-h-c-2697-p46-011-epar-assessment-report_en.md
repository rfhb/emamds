## 1. Introduction

On 01 July 2022, the MAH submitted a completed study including a subset of paediatric patients (Study No./acronym: AC-055H302/RUBATO OL) for Opsumit (macitentan), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended.

Of the 111 patients (age range: 13 to 49 years) enrolled, 12 (10.8%) were paediatric subjects (age range: 13 to less than 18 years).

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Macitentan (Opsumit) is an orally active endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA), active on both endothelin (ET) ETA and ETB receptors, approved for marketing in the EU through the centralised procedure on 20 December 2013. Macitentan is currently approved by the European Commission as 10 mg film-coated tablet for oral use for the following indication:

'Opsumit, as monotherapy or in combination, is indicated for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients of WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III.

Efficacy has been shown in a PAH population including idiopathic and heritable PAH, PAH associated with connective tissue disorders, and PAH associated with corrected simple congenital heart disease (see section 5.1)'.

Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended, the initial marketing authorisation application included an EMA Decision (P/0087/2012) on the agreement of an EU Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP; EMEA-001032-PIP01-10-M01) for oral use of macitentan as dispersible tablet and film-coated tablet for the treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) indication. The last EMA Decision (P/0480/2021) corresponding to the acceptance of a modification of an agreed PIP for macitentan for the treatment of PAH (EMEA-001032-PIP01-10-M04) was issued by December 2021.

In accordance with Article 46 of the regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, Janssen-Cilag International NV hereby submits to the EMA a final study report for the study number AC-055H302 (acronym: RUBATO open-label [OL]).

The MAH stated that study number AC-055H302 (RUBATO OL) 'Prospective, multi-center, single-arm, open-label long-term study assessing the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of macitentan in Fontan-palliated adult and adolescent subjects' is a standalone study. As such, a line listing is not provided.

AC-055H302 (RUBATO OL) was a Phase 3 extension of the AC-055H301 (RUBATO double-blind [DB]) study. The results of Study AC-055H301/RUBATO DB, which did not meet the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, were already submitted to the EMA for Opsumit (EMEA/H/C/002697/P46/010) in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006.

Both AC-055H301/RUBATO DB and AC-055H302/RUBATO OL studies are part of the PIP for oral use of macitentan as dispersible tablet and film-coated tablet agreed upon for the treatment of functional single ventricle heart disease with total cavo-pulmonary connection indication (EMEA-001032-PIP0319; [Decision P/0242/2021]), but not for the PIP agreed to the treatment of PAH indication (EMEA001032-PIP01-M04; [Decision P/0480/2021]).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The formulation of macitentan used in the study was the same as the product approved in the EU ( i.e ., 10 mg film-coated tablets), which is intended to treat adult patients with PAH from World Health Organization FC II and III.

No paediatric formulation was used.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for study number AC-055H302 (RUBATO OL): 'Prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open-label long-term study assessing the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of macitentan in Fontan-palliated adult and adolescent subjects'.

AC-055H302 (RUBATO OL) was a Phase 3 extension of the AC-055H301 (RUBATO double-blind [DB]) study. The OL study was stopped prematurely because the main DB study did not meet the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.

Only 12/111 (10.8%) participants were paediatric subjects (age range: 13 to less than 18 years).

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Clinical study number AC-055H302 (RUBATO OL): Prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open-label long-term study assessing the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of macitentan in Fontan-palliated adult and adolescent subjects

## Description

The RUBATO open-label (OL) study was a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, Phase 3 extension of the RUBATO double-blind (DB) study to assess the long-term use of macitentan 10 mg in Fontanpalliated adult and adolescent participants beyond the 52 weeks of treatment (macitentan 10 mg or placebo) in the RUBATO DB study. Participants were rolled over from the DB study to this OL study without knowledge of their previous study treatment. The RUBATO OL analyses included safety endpoints and exploratory efficacy endpoints.

The study comprised the following 4 consecutive periods:

## -Enrollment period :

The enrollment period for a participant began with the visit at Week 52 in the RUBATO DB study and signing of the informed consent form and lasted until the administration of the first dose in the RUBATO OL study (Visit 1).

-Treatment period :

The treatment period started with the administration of the first dose of macitentan 10 mg in the OL study and lasted until whichever of the following occurred first:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 104 weeks (2 years) of study treatment for each participant after the last participant completed the RUBATO DB treatment period.
- The participant or investigator decided to discontinue the study intervention.
- The sponsor decided to stop the RUBATO OL study.

## -Safety follow-up (S-FU) period :

For an individual participant, S-FU started on the day after the last dose of OL study intervention and ended 30 to 35 days thereafter with the EOS visit.

## -End-Of-Study :

For an individual participant, the study was completed with the EOS visit. For all participants, EOS corresponded to the last visit performed in this RUBATO OL study.

A diagrammatic representation of the study design is presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Study Design

## Treatments

The study intervention used in the OL study was macitentan 10 mg, orally administered as film-coated tablets once daily with or without food.

The treatment period started with the administration of the first dose of macitentan 10 mg in the OL study and lasted until whichever of the following occurred first:

- 104 weeks (2 years) of study treatment for each participant after the last participant completed the RUBATO DB treatment period.
- The participant or investigator decided to discontinue the study intervention.
- The sponsor decided to stop the RUBATO OL study.

## Objectives

Primary Objective:

Secondary Objectives:

- -To assess the effect of macitentan on exercise capacity (measured by peak oxygen uptake/consumption [VO2]).
- -To assess the effect of macitentan on daily Physical Activity measured by Accelerometer (PA-Ac).

Other Objectives:

- -To assess the effect of macitentan on time to first occurrence of clinical worsening (or morbidity) events and VO2 at ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT). Due to the early termination of the study, other objectives (efficacy on other endpoints related to exercise capacity, effect on Nterminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, and effect on pharmacoeconomic endpoints related to hospitalization) were not assessed.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary Endpoint

- -The primary endpoint for this study was safety and tolerability.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sample size

Only participants from the AC-055H301/RUBATO DB study who had previously completed the 52weeks treatment period were rolled over to RUBATO OL study. The planned total sample size was approximately 134 participants.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Not applicable.

## Statistical Methods

The RUBATO OL analyses included exploratory efficacy endpoints and safety endpoints. No formal hypothesis testing was performed.

No sample size statistical considerations were made for the RUBATO OL study as this was dependent on the number of randomized participants in the RUBATO DB study.

Data were listed and summarized by appropriate descriptive statistics.

Following population analysis sets were used in the study.

## Results

## Participant flow

In this OL extension study (Study Period: 03 May 2019 [first participant first visit] to 18 January 2022 [last participant last visit]), 111 participants from de RUBATO DB study (54 participants from the placebo group [hereafter, DB-placebo] and 57 participants from the macitentan group [hereafter, DBmacitentan]) were enrolled and received macitentan 10 mg once daily. Of these, 110 (99.1%) participants prematurely discontinued study intervention (Table 2) and study (Table 3).

The main reason for premature study intervention discontinuation and study discontinuation was sponsor's decision to terminate the OL study because the main DB study did not meet the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (93/111 [83.8%] participants). Other reasons included death (1 participant in the DB-placebo group) and COVID-19 related other non-medical reasons (1 participant in the in the DB-macitentan group).

Key: DB=double-blind; BMI=body mass index; IQ=Interquartile; OL=open-label; SD=standard deviation.

Note: N's for each parameter reflect non-missing values.

a Each market is assigned to a geographical region based on the Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use (M49).

b For adults, BMI cutoffs defined as: underweight (&lt;18.5), normal weight (18.5-&lt;25), overweight (25-&lt;30), obese class I (30-&lt;35), obese class II

(35-&lt;40), obese class III (&gt;=40). For adolescents, BMI-for-age cutoffs equivalent to BMI cutoffs for adults are calculated from the WHO Child Growth Standards (2007).

Age and BMI are derived from analysis set baseline. Other parameters were assessed at enrollment into DB study.

All subjects received Macitentan 10 mg in the Open Label (OL) study.

Key: BMI = Body mass index, IQ = Interquartile, SD = Standard deviation

Note: N's for each parameter reflect non-missing values.

a Each market is assigned to a geographical region based on the Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use (M49). b For adults, BMI cutoffs defined as: underweight (&lt;18.5), normal weight (18.5-&lt;25), overweight (25-&lt;30), obese class I (30-&lt;35), obese class II (35-&lt;40), obese class III (&gt;=40). For adolescents, BMI-for-age cutoffs equivalent to BMI cutoffs foradults are calculated from the WHO Child Growth Standards (2007).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Age, body weight, height, and BMI, are derived from analysis set baseline. Other parameters were assessed at enrollment into DB study. All subjects received Macitentan 10 mg in the Open Label (OL) study.

## Other Baseline Characteristics

At OL study start, only 2/111 participants (1.8%) were receiving any pulmonary arterial hypertension specific concomitant therapies ( i.e. , sildenafil citrate/sildenafil). At OL baseline, the majority of participants were in NYHA Class II (100/111 [90.1%]). The median (IQ range) peak VO2 at OL baseline  was 22.90 (19.00, 27.00) mL/kg/min. The mean (SD) count per minute of daily PA-Ac at OL baseline was 262.95 (124.244) in the DB-placebo group (n=35) and 296.47 (123.433) in the DBmacitentan group (n=38).

## At OL study start, the median (IQ range) time

since Fontan-palliation completion was 19.46 (15.00; 23.32) years and 69/111 participants (62.2%) had lateral tunnel total cavopulmonary connection. A higher proportion of participants had an associated dominant left ventricular morphology (55.9% [62/111 participants]) compared with right/mixed morphology (44.1% [49/111 participants]).

A summary of baseline characteristics in paediatric patients (12 to &lt;18 years) in the RUBATO OL Extension and Total Macitentan Analysis Sets is provided in Table 8.

## Number analysed

A total of 111 participants from the DB study (placebo group: 54, macitentan group: 57) were enrolled and received macitentan 10 mg in the OL study.

## Populations Analyzed

The definitions of the analysis sets used in the OL extension study are described in Table 1.

The RUBATO Pool Full Analysis Set included all 137 participants who were randomized in the DB study, irrespective of their enrollment in the OL extension study (Table 9).

The RUBATO OL Extension Set included 111 participants from the DB study who enrolled in the OL extension study and received at least 1 dose of OL study treatment, i.e., macitentan 10 mg. The treatment group placebo/macitentan 10 mg corresponds to DB-placebo and macitentan 10 mg/macitentan 10 mg corresponds to DB-macitentan 10 mg (Table 9).

The Total Macitentan Analysis Set (Macitentan 10 mg pool) included 122 participants who received macitentan 10 mg in the DB study but did not enroll into the OL study (n=11), participants who received macitentan 10 mg in the DB as well as OL study (n=57), and participants who received macitentan 10 mg only in the OL study (n=54) (Table 9).

## Efficacy results

## · Data Sets Analyzed

The exploratory efficacy variables were analyzed on the RUBATO Pool Full Analysis Set and RUBATO OL Extension Set (Table 9).

- Fontan-palliated Morbidity and Fontan-palliated Clinical Worsening

Time to event analyses were conducted in the RUBATO Pool Full Analysis Set over the combined DB + OL studies.

Five participants in the placebo/macitentan 10 mg group and 3 participants in the macitentan 10 mg/macitentan 10 mg group had clinical events related to Fontan-palliated morbidity.

Three participants in the placebo/macitentan 10 mg group and 6 participants in the macitentan 10 mg/macitentan 10 mg group had clinical events related to Fontan-palliated clinical worsening.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For both analyses, the Kaplan-Meier estimates were similar between the 2 groups (Figure 2 and Figure 3).

The clinical study report (CSR) of study AC-055H302/RUBATO OL included a mix of adolescents and adults with no disaggregated efficacy results included by age subset.

## · Physical Activity Measure by Accelerometer

In the RUBATO OL Extension Set, at OL baseline (n=73), the mean (SD) of mean count per minute of daily PA-Ac was 280.40 (124.110) (DB-placebo: 262.95 [124.244], DB-macitentan: 296.47 [123.433]). The mean (SD) change from OL baseline to OL Week 26 (n=42) was 19.74 (131.622) (DBplacebo: 24.19 [86.001], DB-macitentan: 15.70 [164.609]) and from OL baseline to OL Week 52 (n=20) was 44.58 (153.196) (DB-placebo: 97.51 [159.620], DB-macitentan: -8.36 [133.565]).

## · Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing - Change in Peak VO2 and VO2 at VAT

In the RUBATO OL Extension Set, at OL baseline (N=111), the mean (SD) peak VO2 was 23.33 (6.055) mL/kg/min (DB-placebo: 22.70 [5.923] mL/kg/min, DB-macitentan: 23.93 [6.170] mL/kg/min). The mean (SD) change from OL baseline to OL Week 52 (n=71) was -0.82 (2.724) mL/kg/min (DBplacebo: -0.69 [2.569] mL/kg/min, DB-macitentan: -0.93 [2.873] mL/kg/min).

At OL baseline (N=111), the mean (SD) VO2 at VAT was 14.60 (3.725) mL/kg/min (DB-placebo: 14.71 [3.547] mL/kg/min, DB-macitentan: 14.48 [3.914] mL/kg/min). The mean (SD) change from OL baseline to OL Week 52 (n=65) was -0.12 (2.643) mL/kg/min (DB-placebo: -0.45 [2.181] mL/kg/min, DB-macitentan: 0.16 [2.986] mL/kg/min).

## Safety results

## · Data Sets Analyzed

For the OL extension study, safety data were analyzed using the RUBATO OL Extension Set including 111 participants who enrolled in the OL study and received at least 1 dose of OL study intervention, i.e ., macitentan 10 mg.

To analyze safety data during the macitentan treatment-emergent period (DB+OL periods), safety endpoints were analyzed using Total Macitentan Analysis Set (macitentan 10 mg pool) which included 122 participants who received macitentan 10 mg in the DB study but did not enroll into the OL study (n=11), participants who received macitentan 10 mg in the DB as well as OL study (n=57), and participants who received macitentan 10 mg only in the OL study (n=54) (Table 9).

## · Extent of Exposure

## RUBATO OL Extension Set (N=111)

The median (IQ range) study intervention duration and total exposure to study intervention (with/without interruptions) was 53.86 (45.71 to 76.57/76.0) weeks.

## Total Macitentan Analysis Set (N=122)

The median (IQ range) study intervention duration (regardless of interruption) and total exposure to study intervention (excluding interruptions) was 84.29 (52.14 to 110.86) weeks and 80.29 (52.14 to 107.29) weeks, respectively.

A summary of  Study Treatment Exposure in paediatric patients (12 to &lt;18 years) in the RUBATO OL Extension and Total Macitentan Analysis Sets are provided in Table 10.

a Study treatment duration (weeks) is defined as [(treatment end date - treatment start date + 1)/7], regardless of treatment interruptions.

b Total exposure to treatment (weeks) is defined as the [study treatment duration (days) - the sum of all treatment interruptions (days)]/7.

c In the treatment arm, overall study treatment in the analysis set, i.e. comprising placebo and macitentan 10 mg is summarized.

Gaps between DB EOT and OL treatment start date are considered as interruption

All subjects received Macitentan 10 mg in the Open Label (OL) study.

## · Adverse Events

RUBATO OL Extension Set (N=111)

The proportion of participants with at least 1 treatment-emergent AE was 61.3% (68 participants; DBplacebo: 36/54 [66.7%], DB-macitentan: 32/57 [56.1%]).

The most frequently reported treatment-emergent AEs ( ≥ 5% all participants) were COVID-19 (14 [12.6%] participants; DB-placebo: 6/54 [11.1%], DB-macitentan: 8/57 [14.0%]), headache (8 [7.2%] participants; DB-placebo: 4/54 [7.4%], DB-macitentan: 4/57 [7.0%]), fatigue (7 [6.3%] participants; DB-placebo: 3/54 [5.6%], DB-macitentan: 4/57 [7.0%], and palpitations (7 [6.3%] participants; DBplacebo: 2/54 [3.7%], DB-macitentan: 5/57 [8.8%]).

An overview of treatment-emergent AEs during the OL extension study (RUBATO OL Extension Set) and macitentan treatment-emergent period (Total Macitentan Analysis Set) is provided in Table 11.

Key: AE = Adverse event

a If the intensity is missing, the event is considered severe.

b An AE is categorized as related if assessed by the investigator as related to study treatment or in case the relationship is missing.

c AEs leading to death are based on AE outcome of Fatal.

d An AE is categorized as serious as assessed by the investigator or in case the information of seriouness is missing.

e Subject-years of observation is calculated as (sum of subject-observation time for all subjects / 365.25 days). For each subject, the subjectobservation time is calculated by considering the study treatment duration for subjects without event or by considering the study treatment duration up to the date of first event (or up to the study treatment end date, if earlier) for subjects with event.

f Adjusted incidence rate is calculated as 100 * (number of subjects with at least one treatment-emergent event/subject-years of observation). All subjects received Macitentan 10 mg in the Open Label (OL) study.

- Deaths and Adverse Events with Fatal Outcome

RUBATO OL Extension Set (N=111)

One adult participant (DB-placebo) died due to an ' unknown ' cause.

Total Macitentan Analysis Set (N=122)

One adult participant died due to an unknown cause during the OL study.

- Serious Adverse Events

RUBATO OL Extension Set (N=111)

The proportion of participants who had at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE was 16.2% (18 participants; DB-placebo: 10/54 [18.5%], DB-macitentan: 8/57 [14.0%]). One participant had an SAE of decreased sperm concentration during the OL study. The participant had a medical history of fertility disorders.

One participant (DB-placebo group) had an SAE of COVID-19.

No treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in more than 1 participant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Total Macitentan Analysis Set (N=122)

The proportion of participants with at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE was 23.8% (29 participants). Atrial flutter was reported in 2 participants and all other SAEs were reported 1 participant each.

One participant had an SAE of COVID-19.

- Discontinuations Due to Adverse Events

## RUBATO OL Extension Set (N=111)

Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study interventionwere reported in 2 (1.8%) participants in the DB-placebo group and these were death and decreased spermatozoa progressive motility.

No COVID-19 related AEs led to study intervention discontinuation.

## Total Macitentan Analysis Set (N=122)

Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study intervention were reported in 5 (4.1%) participants.

These were increased AST (1 participant), increased ALT and AST (1 participant), and changes in mental status (1 participant), during the DB study. The OL study AEs leading to study intervention discontinuation were death and decreased spermatozoa progressive motility.

No COVID-19 related AEs led to study intervention discontinuation.

- Adverse Events of Special Interest

## RUBATO OL Extension Set (N=111)

Five (4.5%) participants had at least 1 Hepatic adverse events of special interest (AESI) (DB-placebo: 4/54 participants [7.4%], DB-macitentan: 1/57 participant [1.8%]), corresponding to an incidence rate of 4.0/100 participant-years (PY) of observation.  Two (1.8%) participants (both DB-placebo) had serious Hepatic AESI (hepatic mass and hepatocellular carcinoma). No Hepatic AESI led to discontinuation of study intervention. A treatment-emergent increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (HH) was reported in 1 (0.9%) participant and bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN (HH) was reported in 1 (0.9%) participant.

Two (1.8%) participants (1 in each group) had at least 1 Edema and fluid retention AESI (preferred term: peripheral edema), corresponding to an incidence rate of 1.5/100 PY of observation.

One (0.9%) participant (DB-macitentan) had an Anemia/hemoglobin decrease AESI (preferred term: microcytic anemia) corresponding to an incidence rate of 0.8/100 PY of observation.

Two (1.8%) participants (DB-placebo) had at least 1 Hypotension AESI (preferred term: decreased blood pressure) corresponding to an incidence rate of 1.5/100 PY of observation. None of these events were reported as serious or led to discontinuation of the study intervention.

## Total Macitentan Analysis Set (N=122)

Ten (8.2%) participants had at least 1 Hepatic AESI corresponding to an incidence rate of 5.1/100 PY of observation. By preferred term, these included increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (3 participants), increased AST, and increased transaminase (2 participants each). Three (2.5%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

participants had serious Hepatic AESI (increased ALT and increased AST; hepatic mass; and hepatocellular carcinoma) and 2 (1.6%) participants had Hepatic AESI which led to discontinuation of study intervention (increased ALT and AST; increased AST). Treatment-emergent increases in AST ≥ 3 x ULN (HH) were reported in 2 (1.7%) participants, ALT ≥ 3 x ULN (HH) were reported in 3 (2.5%) participants, and bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN (HH) were reported in 3 (2.5%) participants. No participant had ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN and total bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN (at the same sample date and/or at any post-baseline time point up to 30 days after EOT).

Seven (5.7%) participants had at least 1 Edema and fluid retention AESI corresponding to an incidence rate of 3.6/100 PY of observation. The most frequent AESI was peripheral edema (4 participants). One (0.8%) participant had a serious Edema and fluid retention AESI (preferred term: pleural effusion). No participant discontinued study intervention due to Edema and fluid retention AESI.

One (0.8%) participant had an Anemia/hemoglobin decrease AESI (preferred term: microcytic anemia) corresponding to an incidence rate of 0.5/100 PY of observation. No Anemia/hemoglobin decrease AESI were reported as serious or led to discontinuation of the study intervention.

Three (2.5%) participants had at least 1 Hypotension AESI corresponding to an incidence rate of 1.5/100 PY of observation. By preferred term, these were decreased blood pressure (2 participants) and orthostatic hypotension (1 participant). No Hypotension AESI were reported as serious or led to discontinuation of the study intervention.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Macitentan is currently approved by the European Commission as 10 mg film-coated tablet for oral use for the following indication: 'Opsumit, as monotherapy or in combination, is indicated for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients with WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III. Efficacy has been shown in a PAH population, including idiopathic and heritable PAH, PAH associated with connective tissue disorders, and PAH associated with corrected simple congenital heart disease'.

This Article 46 procedure of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, concerns the submission of a stand-alone study, which is the AC-055H302 (RUBATO open-label [OL]) study named: 'Prospective, multi-center, single-arm, open-label long-term study assessing the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of macitentan in Fontan-palliated adult and adolescent subjects'.

AC-055H302/RUBATO OL study, was a Phase 3 extension of the already sumitted AC055H301/RUBATO double-blind (DB) study (Procedure No EMEA/H/C/002697/P46/010.1) to assess the long-term use of macitentan 10 mg for up to 104 weeks (2 years) in Fontan-palliated participants beyond 52 weeks (1 year) of treatment in the RUBATO DB study. Adult and adolescent participants were rolled over from the DB study to this OL study to receive macitentan 10 mg without knowledge of their previous study treatment (macitentan 10 mg or placebo, randomized in a 1:1 ratio). Both DB and OL RUBATO studies are part of an agreed PIP for macitentan for the treatment of functional single ventricle heart disease with total cavo-pulmonary connection indication (EMEA-001032-PIP03-19 [Decision P/0242/2021]; PIP study 1 and PIP study 2, respectively). The primary objective of the hereby submitted study was to assess the long-term safety and tolerability whereas the secondary and other objectives were to assess efficacy endpoints in an exploratory manner. The efficacy exploratory endpoints were the effect of macitentan on exercise capacity (change in Peak VO2) and on daily Physical Activity measured by Accelerometer (PA-Ac) as well as the effect on endpoints related to clinical events (time to first occurrence of clinical worsening or morbidity) and on change in VO2 at ventilatory anaerobic threshold [VAT]). The study design as well as the proposed objectives seem adequate for an OL extension study to describe the long-term effects of macitentan 10 mg in a target population where there are no approved medications for treatment.

In this OL extension study (03 may 2019 [first participant first visit] to 18 January 2022 [last participant last visit]), 111 participants from de RUBATO DB study (54 participants from the placebo group [hereafter, DB-placebo group] and 57 participants from the macitentan group [hereafter, DBmacitentan group]) were enrolled and received macitentan 10 mg film-coated tablets administered orally once-daily. Of the 111 participants enrolled, 10.8% of participants (12/111; DB-placebo group: 6, DB-macitentan group: 6) were adolescents (12 to &lt;18 years). All enrolled participants except 1 (110/111 [99.1%]) prematurely discontinued the study intervention as well as the study. The main reason for premature study intervention discontinuation and study discontinuation was sponsor's decision to terminate the OL study because the main DB study did not meet the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (93/111 [83.8%] participants). With the exception of 1 adolescent participant (DBmacitentan) who terminated study participation prematurely because of lack of efficacy, 11/12 (91.7%) adolescent participants discontinued the study intervention and the study because of the sponsor's decision.

The majority of participants were white (87/111 [78.4%]) and male (77/111 [69.4%]). The median age at OL study start was 23.0 years (age range: 13 to 49 years). At OL study start, the median time since Fontan palliation completion was 19.46 years and 69/111 (62.2%) participants had lateral tunnel total cavopulmonary connection. A higher proportion of participants had an associated dominant left ventricular morphology (62/111 [55.9%]) compared with right/mixed morphology ( 49/111[44.1%]).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At OL baseline, the majority of adolescent participants were in NYHA Class II (11/12 [91.7%]; DBmacitentan group included the only subject in FC I) and the median (IQ range) peak VO2 at OL baseline was 24.20 (18.55, 29.50) mL/kg/min. The mean (SD) count per minute of daily PA-Ac at OL baseline was 288.69 (63.986) in the DB-placebo group (n=4) and 305.35 (146.667) in the DBmacitentan group (n=6). No adolescent patients were on PAH specific therapies at baseline. The applicant has not provided information for the OL study in adolescents with respect to baseline characteristics such as time since Fontan palliation completion, type of primary TCPC Fontan it was stated in the EMEA/H/C/002697/P46/010.1 assessment report for the completed rubato DB which not only include the age, but also the type of TCPC or the type of functional ventricular heart among others, could still interfere with the interpretation of the treatment response. Therefore, it is considered that no further information is required.

completion or associated dominant ventricular morphology. However, it has to be kept on mind that as study, differences as regards baseline characteristics between paediatric and adult studied populations, The exploratory efficacy variables were analyzed on the RUBATO Pool Full Analysis Set (N=137; participants enrolled in the OL study who received at least 1 dose of OL study intervention [i.e., macitentan 10 mg]) and RUBATO OL Extension Set (N=111; data from the same participants randomized in DB were concatenated with their data from the OL extension study). For the analyses of the effect of macitentan on efficacy endpoints, obtained data were similar between the DB-placebo and DB-macitentan. These results are in line with those observed in the main DB study where the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were not met. Safety data were analyzed using the RUBATO OL Extension Set (N=111) and the Total Macitentan Analysis Set (macitentan 10 mg pool; included 122 participants who received macitentan 10 mg in the DB study but did not enroll into the OL study [n=11], participants who received macitentan 10 mg in both DB and OL studies [n=57], and participants who received macitentan 10 mg only in the OL study ([n=54]). The median (IQ range) study intervention duration (regardless of interruption) and total exposure to study intervention (excluding interruptions) was 84.29 (52.14 to 110.86) weeks and 80.29 (52.14 to 107.29) weeks, respectively. For adolescent participants, the median (IQ range) study intervention duration (regardless of interruption) Study treatment duration (weeks) and total exposure to study intervention (excluding interruptions) Total exposure to treatment was 105.00 (74.14 to 130.71) weeks and 103.86 (73.86 to 122.29) weeks, respectively. Although RUBATO OL study did not last enough to be considered a purely long-term study, the obtained data are considered relevant to support data obtained from the RUBATO DB study. For RUBATO OL Extension Set, the proportion of participants with at least 1 treatment-emergent AE was 61.3% (68 participants; DB-placebo: 36/54 [66.7%], DB-macitentan: 32/57 [56.1%]). The most frequently reported treatment-emergent AEs ( ≥ 5% all participants) were COVID-19 (14 [12.6%] participants; DB-placebo: 6/54 [11.1%], DB-macitentan: 8/57 [14.0%]), headache (8 [7.2%] participants; DB-placebo: 4/54 [7.4%], DB-macitentan: 4/57 [7.0%]), fatigue (7 [6.3%] participants; DB-placebo: 3/54 [5.6%], DB-macitentan: 4/57 [7.0%], and palpitations (7 [6.3%] participants; DBplacebo: 2/54 [3.7%], DB-macitentan: 5/57 [8.8%]). When adolescent particpants were assessed, the proportion of participants with at least 1 treatment-emergent AE was 66.7% (8/12 participants; DBplacebo: 5, DB-macitentan: 3). The proportion of adolescent participants who had at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE was 25.0% (3/12 participants; DB-placebo: 1, DB-macitentan: 2). No adolescent patients experienced AEs leading to death, related serious AEs or AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment. Overall, no unexpected or new safety findings were observed during the OL extension study. According to the submitted data, the AC-055H302 (RUBATO OL) study results confirmed no clinically meaningful difference favouring macitentan that would provide treatment benefit to Fontan-palliated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients. Moreover, safety findings were consistent with the known safety profile of macitentan, with no new safety findings reported/observed during the study.

Since the MAH does not claim for use of macitentan in Fontan-palliated patients on the basis of the lack of benefit versus placebo shown in the AC-055H301 (RUBATO DB) study and given that safety data reported in the RUBATO study are in line with the approved EU summary product characteristics (SmPC) for macitentan, it is considered that no further regulatory action is required.

## 3. CHMP Overall conclusion and recommendation

The AC-055H302 (RUBATO OL) study submitted within this procedure was a Phase 3 extension of the AC-055H301 (RUBATO double-blind [DB]) study that was prematurely stopped because the main DB study did not meet the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. Safety findings were in line with the known safety profile of macientan.

Of the 111 patients (age range: 13 to 49 years) enrolled, 12 (10.8%) participants were paediatric subjects (age range: 13 to less than 18 years).

## Recommendation

Since the MAH does not claim for use of macitentan in Fontan-palliated patients on the basis of the lack of benefit versus placebo shown in the AC-055H301 (RUBATO) study and given that safety data reported in the RUBATO study are in line with the approved EU summary product characteristics (SmPC) for macitentan, it is considered that no further regulatory action is required.
