## 1. Introduction

On 4 th  February 2021, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Imipenem/Cilastatin/Relebactam (Recarbrio ® ), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

This is a stand-alone Article 46 submission. A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that

Study P020MK7655A: Phase 1b, noncomparative, open-label, single IV dose study to evaluate the PK, safety, and tolerability of imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam in paediatric participants from birth to less than 18 years of age with confirmed or suspected gram-negative infections is part of a paediatric clinical development program and is part of the PIP approved by the EMA (PIP EMEA-001809-PIP01-15-M02). The variation application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e containing several studies) is expected to be submitted by the end of 2023. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed.

IMI/REL was initially approved in the EU in February 2020 for the treatment of infections due to aerobic gram-negative organisms in adults with limited treatment options. Subsequently, in November 2020, IMI/REL was approved by the European Commission for the additional indication for treatment of HAP, including VAP, in adults and bacteraemia that occurs in association with, or is suspected to be associated with HAP or VAP, in adults.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The formulation used in the submitted, completed study is the same single vial IMI/REL fixed-dose combination as was authorised in the EU for use in adults as of February 2020.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Study P020MK7655A: Phase 1b, noncomparative, open-label, single IV dose study to evaluate the PK, safety, and tolerability of imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam in paediatric participants from birth to less than 18 years of age with confirmed or suspected gram-negative infections.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study P020MK7655A: Phase 1b, noncomparative, open-label, single IV dose study to evaluate the PK, safety, and tolerability of imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam in paediatric participants from birth to less than 18 years of age with confirmed or suspected gramnegative infections.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Description Methods

## Objective(s)

Primary objective: To obtain plasma PK data and characterize the PK profile of imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam (REL) following administration of a single intravenous (IV) dose of IMI/REL in paediatric participants from birth to less than 18 years of age receiving standard-of-care antibacterial therapy for a confirmed or suspected gram-negative bacterial infection.

Secondary objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of a single IV dose of IMI/REL in paediatric participants from birth to less than 18 years of age receiving standard-of-care antibacterial therapy for a confirmed or suspected gram-negative bacterial infection.

## Study design

This was an open-label, single-dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of MK-7655A (IMI/REL) and to identify the appropriate dose in paediatric participants from birth to less than 18 years of age receiving standard-of-care antibacterial therapy for treatment of a confirmed or suspected gram-negative bacterial infection.

PK parameters were assessed for 6-12 hours following single IV dose and safety parameters were assessed for up to 24 hours, with a safety follow-up visit or telephone call at 14 ±2 days.

Once the first 3 PK evaluable participants were enrolled in each of Cohorts 1 through 3, enrolment in that cohort was paused and an interim PK and safety review was performed to decide on the dose for the remaining half of the cohorts. An aggregate PK and safety interim review was conducted when enrolment was completed in Cohorts 1 through 3 to determine the initial dose for Cohorts 4 and 5. Enrolment in Cohorts 4 and 5 was also done in parallel and similar interim reviews were subsequently conducted.

## Study population /Sample size

## Main Inclusion Criteria

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary endpoints:

- REL: plasma PK exposures such as area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax), PK parameters such as systemic clearance and central volume of distribution.
- Imipenem: %fT&gt;MIC, plasma PK exposures such as AUC and Cmax, PK parameters such as systemic clearance and central volume of distribution.
- Cilastatin: plasma PK exposures such as AUC and Cmax.

## Secondary endpoints:

Adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory evaluations, Events of Clinical Interest (ECIs), vital sign measurements, and physical examinations.

Special attention was given to post-treatment visit (Visit 3) laboratory abnormalities, based on the toxicity grading, as described in the United States National Institutes of Health (US NIH) Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) paediatric toxicity scale.

## Statistical Methods

Collected PK samples were analysed using noncompartmental PK analysis (cilastatin) and population PK modelling (imipenem and REL). Actual times were used for the PK analyses. Summary PK parameters for all analytes were derived by Cohort levels, as allowed by the data.

Safety and tolerability were assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including incidence, severity, and type of AEs, changes in clinical laboratory tests, and changes from baseline in vital sign measurements at the interim reviews and the end of study. Descriptive and/or summary statistics were provided.

A total of 46 treated participants received a single dose infusion of IMI/REL.

## Baseline data

The majority of participants were female (59.6%), white (78.7%), and of non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (83.0%). Low mean creatine clearance observed among participants in Cohort 5 (&lt;3 months of age) was most likely the result of functional immaturity of the developing newborn kidneys.

The 4 most frequently reported medical history conditions in the safety population by PT included anaemia (19.6%), varicella infection (13.0%), respiratory failure (8.7%), and hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (6.5%). The 4 most frequently reported prior medications in the safety population included acetaminophen (43.5%), ampicillin (23.9%), gentamicin (21.7%), and cefoperazone sodium (+) sulbactam sodium (21.7%). The 4 most frequently reported concomitant medications in the safety population included gentamicin (19.6%), acetaminophen (19.6%), dextrose (15.2%), and cholecalciferol (15.2%).

## Pharmacokinetic results

4 PK samples were collected per participant at 4 different timepoints in each of the age cohorts for PK evaluation of imipenem, cilastatin, and REL. Plasma concentrations of imipenem, cilastatin, and REL and were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric method.

As planned, protocol-defined interim reviews of safety and PK data were completed for the participants in each age cohort to assess the suitability of the proposed initial doses. Dose modifications that were made based on the outcome of PK modelling and assessment of observed safety data as a result of the interim reviews are summarized below (Table 3.)

A total of 51 participants were screened, 47 were allocated, and 46 received study medication (a single dose of IV IMI/REL). All 46 participants who received IMI/REL completed the study as per the protocol. 42 of the 46 treated participants were included in the popPK population for the PK analyses, and 4 participants were excluded from the Per Protocol population due to protocol deviations with the dosing extended beyond the planned infusion duration.

Population PK modeling leveraging sparse PK data per participant was performed to summarize PK parameters (Systemic clearance and V1) and PK exposures (AUC0-∞ and Cmax) for both imipenem and REL.

NCA was performed for cilastatin. Because of the sparse PK sampling schedule per participant, the λz NCA parameter was not calculated for the cilastatin analyte. As a result, the NCA PK parameters depending on λ z, were also not calculated (including AUC0-∞ , CL, and V1) for cilastatin.

Summary statistics of imipenem, REL and cilastatin PK parameters in Cohorts 1 through 5 are presented in Table 4, Table 5, and Table 6, respectively. Note that in the tables the initial dose in all cohorts are listed however the MAH states that the summary of cohort-specific PK parameters is described by actual dose administered and infusion duration.

## Efficacy results

Study P020 was a single-dose PK and safety study and clinical efficacy was not evaluated.

## Safety results

Safety analyses were based on the safety population, which included all 46 allocated participants who received infusion of study medication.

Safety results are summarized overall and then separately for different age group cohorts in the submitted report, as significant physiological differences exist for paediatric patients of different age groups (eg, older age Cohorts 1-3 [2 to &lt;18 years] vs those enrolled in younger age Cohorts 4-5 [&lt;2 years]).

Overall, for Cohorts 1-5, 8 participants (17.4%) experienced at least 1 AE and 2 participants (4.3%) had AEs categorized as drug-related by the investigator. All reported AEs occurred in the posttreatment period, most were mild in severity, none were SAEs or fatal events, and none led to infusion interruption/discontinuation or study discontinuation. Overall, for Cohorts 1-5, the most frequently reported AEs were anaemia (6.5%), and diarrhoea (6.5%). Drug-related AEs reported in the study were increased ALT, increased AST, anaemia, and diarrhoea.

Elevations in liver transaminases meeting pre-defined criteria were categorized as Adverse Events of Special Interest. No events meeting these criteria were documented.

Thirty-eight participants (3 in Cohort 1, 5 in Cohort 2, 6 in Cohort 3, 8 in Cohort 4 and 16 in Cohort 5) had at least one laboratory value at post-treatment Visit 3 that met DMID or DAIDS toxicity (for

calcium results) grades of 1-4 (majority were Grade 1 or 2). No clinically meaningful changes in chemistry and haematology mean values or vital signs were observed in any of the cohorts from Baseline to Visit 3.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Relebactam (REL) is a non-β-lactam BLI of the diazobicyclooctane family and an inhibitor of Ambler class A and class C β-lactamases. REL restores the activity of imipenem in carbapenem-resistant gramnegative bacterial infections. REL has been developed for administration as an FDC with imipenem and cilastatin in a single vial, for IV administration (IMI/REL).

IMI/REL was initially approved in the EU in February 2020 for the treatment of infections due to aerobic gram-negative organisms in adults with limited treatment options. Subsequently, in November 2020, IMI/REL was approved by the European Commission for the additional indication for treatment of HAP, including VAP, in adults and bacteraemia that occurs in association with, or is suspected to be associated with HAP or VAP, in adults.

Study P020 was conducted in accordance with guidance from the EMA-CHMP and US FDA and is part of the PIP approved by the EMA (PIP EMEA-001809-PIP01-15-M02). The information from this Phase 1b study will be used to determine appropriate dosing regimens for a Phase 2/3 efficacy study of IMI/REL in the paediatric population (Study P021). A variation applicant comprising data to support the efficacy, safety, and PK of IMI/REL to treat paediatric patients with HAP, including VAP, and bacteraemia that occurs in association with, or is suspected to be associated with HAP or VAP, and infections due to aerobic gram-negative organisms with limited treatment options, is expected by end of 2023.

P020 was an open-label, noncomparative Phase 1b study of a single IV dose of IMI/REL in male and female paediatric participants receiving standard-of-care antibacterial therapy for treatment of a confirmed or suspected gram-negative bacterial infection. Study P020 was a single-dose PK and safety study and clinical efficacy was not evaluated.

Interim PK analysis resulted in modified doses for Cohort 1 (12 to &lt;18), 4 (3 months to &lt;2 years) and 5 (birth to &lt;3 months) (Table 3).

In general, treatment with a single dose of IMI/REL was generally well tolerated and AEs occurred with low frequency. Eight participants (17.4%) experienced at least 1 AE in the study, of which 2 participants (4.3%) experienced mild AEs categorized as drug-related by the investigator (increased ALT, increased AST, anaemia in 1 participant; diarrhoea in 1 participant). All AEs were reported in the post-treatment period and therefore did not result in infusion interruption/discontinuation or study discontinuation. No SAEs or deaths were reported during the study. These results are in keeping with the known safety profile of IMI/REL in adults and the underlying clinical condition being treated.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The results of this study indicate that a single dose of IMI/REL IV infusion was generally well tolerated in paediatric participants (from birth to less than 18 years of age). No safety concerns were observed during the study.

The results of this study do not impact or alter the overall benefit/risk balance of IMI/REL in the currently authorised indications and populations and do not warrant any changes to the terms of marketing authorisation or updates to the Product Information at this time.

The submitted study is part of a paediatric clinical development program. The variation application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e containing several studies) is expected to be submitted by end of 2023.
