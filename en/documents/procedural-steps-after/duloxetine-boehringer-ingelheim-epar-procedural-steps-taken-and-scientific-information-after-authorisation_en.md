Consequently, Annex II has been updated with the new version number and date of the agreed DDPS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| II/0008 | Update of section 4.5 of the Summary of Product Characteristics to reflect the results of a recent duloxetine/warfarin interaction study (study F1J-MC-HMFP). Furthermore, the term \"adolescents\" was included in section 4.2 of the SPC in order to align this section with the current QRD template. | 29/05/2009          | 14/07/2009                               | no SPC                           | longer Study F1J-MC-HMFP was an open-label study with the primary objective to evaluate the anticoagulant effects of multiple doses of warfarin when taken at the same time with multiple doses of duloxetine as measured by changes in the international normalized ratio (INR). Increases in INR values were reported when duloxetine was co- administered with warfarin. However, concomitant administration of duloxetine with warfarin under steady state conditions, in healthy volunteers, as part of a clinical pharmacology study, did not result in a clinically significant change in INR from baseline or in the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. |
| II/0007 | Quality changes to change the finished product specification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | product 23/04/2009  | 28/04/2009                               |                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| II/0002 | Medicinal Update of Sections 4.8 \"Undesirable effects\" and 4.9 \"Overdose\" of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to reflect the most recent clinical trial data findings of the 7th PSUR. The Package Leaftlet (PL) was updated accordingly.                                                  | 19/02/2009          | 03/04/2009                               | SPC, PL                          | A new data lock point for all placebo-controlled clinical studies resulted in a significant increase in the size of the overall database and thus a more robust basis for the determination of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs). As a consequence, the frequency of some ADRs was updated in the SPC. Regarding spontaneous data, the MAH identified one new ADR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
