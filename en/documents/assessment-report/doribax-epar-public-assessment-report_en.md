## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

2.1 Introduction Carbapenems  as  broad  spectrum  antibacterial  agents  are  often  used  as  empiric  therapy  since  they provide  coverage  against  both  gram  positive  and  gram  negative  pathogens.  Multiple  studies  have shown  that  patients  with  severe  infections  if  treated  early  with  agents  that  are  effective  against infecting  organisms  have  better  survival  rate  than  those  treated  initially  with  agents  of  suboptimal antibacterial activity. Therefore in most guidelines carbapenems are first option for empiric therapy of sepsis. At present three carbapenems (meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin and ertapenem) are available in  European  markets.  Resistant  pathogens,  and  especially  multi-drug  resistant  strains,  can  be associated with increased mortality and morbidity. At present carbapenems would fulfill most of the criteria being potentially effective in difficult to treat infections. The applicant is seeking approval for doripenem  for  following  indications:  complicated  urinary  tract  infections  (cUTI),  complicated intraabdominal  infections  (cIAI)  and  nosocomial  pneumonia  (NP)  including  ventilator  associated pneumonia (VAP) Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are associated with a high risk of morbidity, especially in the elderly population, and are the leading cause of gram-negative bacteremia in subjects of all ages. Complicated lower UTIs (cLUTIs) occur in subjects with a functionally, metabolically, or anatomically abnormal urinary  tract  and  range  from  cystitis  to  life-threatening  urosepsis.  The  predisposing  conditions  that constitute  functional  or  anatomical  abnormalities  of  the  urinary  tract  include  the  presence  of  an indwelling catheter, increased residual urine after voiding or neurogenic  bladder, obstructive uropathies  such  as  nephrolithiasis  or  fibrosis,  and  urinary  retention  in  men,  often  due  to  benign prostatic hypertrophy. Complicated UTIs are caused by a broad range of bacteria, many of which are becoming increasingly resistant to multiple antibacterial agents. For this reason, the carbapenems may become the optimal choice for first-line antibacterial therapy. Complicated  intra-abdominal  infections  are  commonly  encountered  in  general  surgery,  and  require both operative drainage and empiric, broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. Since antibacterial therapy must be initiated  before  culture  results  are  available,  the  antibacterial  agent  chosen  must  cover  the gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that comprise the usual gastrointestinal (GI) flora. As reported in the literature, the pathogens most frequently encountered in cIAI  include E. coli ,  other  common Enterobacteriaceae , B. fragilis ,  and  a  wide  variety  of  other anaerobes. Often these infections are polymicrobial caused by aerobic and anaerobic bacteriae. Due to the broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens that cause cIAI, it is  expected that doripenem would be effective in the treatment of cIAIs, including those caused by pathogens  resistant  to  other  antibacterial  agents.NP  is  the  second  most  common  hospital-acquired infection,  with  VAP  the  most  common  intensive  care  unit  (ICU)-acquired  infection. It  caused  by  a broad range of bacteria, and is associated with a high risk of morbidity, especially in mechanicallyventilated subjects. The pathogens most frequently encountered in NP vary from center to center and include S. aureus , K. pneumoniae,  E. coli , P. aeruginosa , Acinetobacter species, H. influenzae ,  and S. pneumoniae .  Because  the  mortality  rate  and  other  complications  (e.g.,  acute  respiratory  distress syndrome [ARDS], empyema, and lung abscess) from NP can be high, effective management of these infections requires early diagnosis and treatment with an optimal antibacterial agent with a spectrum of activity to cover all these pathogens. Carbapenems have the broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and most of them have good activity against more resistant species, such as P. aeruginosa ,  which in many centres is the predominant organism among causative agents of NP.

## · About the product

Doripenem monohydrate (JNJ-38174942, S-4661), a synthetic antibiotic, is a new chemical entity that belongs  to  the  carbapenem  class  of  beta-lactams.  Doripenem  monohydrate  is  sparingly  soluble  in water, slightly soluble in methanol, and practically insoluble in ethanol. Doripenem is administered via intravenous route.

Doripenem is active against a range of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, as shown in vitro and  in  animal  models.  Doripenem  is  resistant  to  hydrolysis  by  a  variety  of β -lactamases,  including penicillinases,  cephalosporinases,  and  extended  spectrum β -lactamases.  Doripenem  exhibits  timedependent  bactericidal  activity  and  moderate  and  short  post-antibiotic  effect  in  vitro  and  in  animal models.

The approval is sought for the indication of: Treatment of the following infections caused by strains of bacteria sensitive to doripenem: · Complicated urinary tract infections (UTI), including complicated and uncomplicated pyelonephritis and cases with concurrent bacteremia. · Complicated intra-abdominal infections · Nosocomial pneumonia , including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) Appropriate  specimens  for  bacteriological  examination  should  be  obtained  in  order  to  isolate  and identify causative organisms and to determine their susceptibility to doripenem. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. Several  Phase  1  studies,  one  Phase  2  study  and  6  pivotal  Phase  3  studies  have  been  submitted  to support the application. Doripenem  was  initially  developed  in  Japan  and  has  received  approval  there  in  2005  as  Finibax. Finibax is indicated for multiple bacterial infections, the majority of which are respiratory indications. The usual dose, according to the Japanese label, is 250 mg intravenously (i.v.) infused over 30 to 60 minutes 2 or 3 times a day; the maximum dose is 500 mg per administration up to a total dose of 1,500 mg/day 2.2 Quality aspects Introduction Doripenem  monohydrate  is  a  new  active  substance  and  is  a  synthetic  carbapenem  antibiotic structurally  related  to  other β -lactam  antibiotics.  It  is  formulated  as  a  dry  powder  for  solution  for infusion due to hydrolysis of the drug substance in water. The  drug  product  contains  doripenem  monohydrate  equivalent  to  500 mg  of  doripenem  (on  an anhydrous basis). The product is a sterile powder for solution for infusion with no excipient. It is supplied in Ph.Eur. Type I flint glass vials with butyl rubber stoppers covered with fluororesin on top and bottom. The vials are capped with aluminium seal a plastic cap.

## Active Substance

Doripenem (INN) or (4 R ,5 S ,6 S )-3-[((3 S ,5 S )-5-[[(aminosulfonyl)amino]methyl]-3pyrrolidinyl)thio]-6-[(1 R )-1-hydroxyethyl]-4-methyl-7-oxo-1-azabicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-ene-2carboxylic  acid  monohydrate  (IUPAC)  is  a  new  chemical  entity  and  hence  an  in-house monograph has been proposed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

It  is  a  white  to slightly  yellowish, off-white crystalline powder, soluble in N,N-dimethylformamide, sparingly soluble in water and slightly soluble or insoluble in most of the organic solvents. It is not hygroscopic.  Doripenem  possesses  6  asymmetric  carbons  but  only  one  pure  isomer  is  used  (see structural formula above). Polymorphism: Doripenem has not been found to exhibit true polymorphism, it can however co-crystallize with water to form a monohydrate.

· Manufacture The synthesis of doripenem monohydrate can be summarised in three steps: hydrolysis, condensation and  hydrogenation  steps  starting  from  two  chirally-pure  materials.  The  final  step  of  the  synthesis consists of purification under aseptic conditions. The route of synthesis is well described and possible impurities specified. Appropriate specifications have been provided and justified for starting materials, solvents, reagents, catalysts  materials  used  in  the  synthesis.  Several  batch  analysis  data  for  both  starting  materials  are presented. Suitable specifications for intermediates of doripenem have also been presented. Sterilisation methods were investigated, and the aseptic processing technique was the method chosen and validated. Based on the presented data the procedure adequately guarantees sterility of the active substance. Manufacturing development: During the course of development doripenem monohydrate was found to have superior stability over other forms. Therefore it was the form selected for late stage development studies and commercial manufacturing. The structure of doripenem was fully elucidated by elemental analysis, UV, IR, MS, 13 C-NMR,  1 HNMR, mass spectrometry.  The  doripenem  molecule  contains  6  chiral  carbon  centers.  Theoretically, maximal 2 6 , or 64 stereoisomers may occur. However, the current manufacturing process consistently produces  drug  substance  with  the  desired  stereochemistry  (see  structure  above).  The  molecular structure  of  doripenem  and  the  absolute  stereochemistry  configuration  were  confirmed  by  single crystal X-ray crystallography. The physico-chemical characterisation was conducted by X-ray powder diffraction, IR spectroscopy, thermogravimetry  analysis  (TGA)  and  differential  thermal  analysis  (DTA).  Doripenem  exists  as different  forms,  however, as  a result  of  the  manufacturing  process,  the  monohydrate is consistently formed. The above analytical methods allow the differentiation of the possible forms. In addition, the hygroscopicity of the drug substance was extensively discussed. An  extensive  discussion  on  potential  and  found  impurities/degradation  products  was  presented including  organic,  inorganic  (heavy  metals  and  residual  catalysts)  compounds.The  information presented is considered sufficient, and the specification limits for impurities/degradation products, in line wih the PhEur Monograph, the guideline on the limits of genotoxic impurities and ICH-guidelines Q3A and Q3C, are acceptable taking into consideration the short duration of the treatment and the severity of the indications.

## Pharmacology

- Primary pharmacodynamics

For primary pharmacological data reference is made to the clinical pharmacodynamics assessment of this report.

- Secondary pharmacodynamics

Some β -lactam antibiotics have been noted for their seizure potential and doripenem was tested in a range  of  systems  for  such  effects.  Doripenem  was  tested  for  GABA  receptor  binding  using  mouse synaptic  membranes  (S-4661-SB-552-N)  since  the  ability  to  act  as  a  ligand  at  the  gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor has been implicated in the molecular mechanism of a seizure inducing potential. At 0.3 to 10 mM doripenem did not significantly displace the agonist 3 H-muscimol (IC50  46.4  mM,  extrapolated).  At  10  mM,  imipenem,  panipenem  and  cefazolin  caused  over  90% displacement  and  corresponding  IC50    values  for  imipenem,  meropenem,  panipenam  and  cefazolin were 0.48, 15.63, 0.63 and 0.99 mM, respectively. A  series  of  studies  (S-4661-SB-553-N,  S-4661-SB-554-N,  S-4661-SB-570-N)  investigating  the potential of doripenem to affect the CNS, in particular the potential for convulsive activity, have been submitted. In some studies meropenem was also included as comparator. In vivo studies in mouse, rat and  dog  indicated  a  low  potential  of  doripenem  to  induce  seizures,  siezure-like  brain  activities  or enhance seizures induced by external stimuli. Intracerebroventricular administration of imipenem or imipenem/cilastin caused seizures and enhanced pentylenetetrazol induced seizures in mice. In mouse given 50, 250 or 500 mg/kg intravenously (P11-K-13) there was no potentiation of electroshock or pentylentetrazole  induced  convulsions  while  imipenem/cilastin  caused  potentiation.  Intracisternal administration of up to  1000  µg/mouse  did not cause seizures while  reference  compounds imipenem/cilastin, cefazolin and biapenem caused clonic and tonic extension convulsion in 20 to 90% of  the  animals.  Further  studies  in  mouse  showed  no  enhancement  of  minimal  electroshock  or pentylentetrazole  induced  convulsions  or  any  effect  on  convulsive  thresholds  by  up  to  400  mg/kg intravenously.

Table 2 .  Overview of studies

In  the  HERG  assay  a  small  but  statistically  significant,  not  dose-dependent  decrease  was  noted. In vivo, in the conscious dog no significant effects of doripenem on cardiovascular/respiratory parameters were  reported.  A  pharmacokinetic  study  in  dog  (FBM-4049,  GLP)  was  conducted  using  the  same animals. Systemic exposure increased from 35.5 to 98.9 and 309.9 (µgxh/ml) from 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg,  intravenously,  values  approximately  up  to  x3  expected  clinical  levels.  Elimination  half-life ranged from 35.9 to 38.1 minutes. Single  intravenous  doses  in  mouse  and  rat  had  no  effect  on  parameters  recorded  reflecting  CNS function.  A  separate  pharmacokinetic  study  in  rat  (FBM03-2048,  GLP)  showed  that  exposure increased from 9.6  to 29.9 and 99.4 (µgxh/ml) at 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg, intravenously. Elimination half-life increased from 6.3 to 10.3 minutes. · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions The potential  for  interactions  of  doripenem  with  valproic  acid  was  studied  in  rat  (S-4661-B-53-N). Doripenem at 100 to 1000 mg/kg intravenously had no effect on the anticonvulsive effects of valproic acid in a pentylentetrazol-induced model. Similarly no effect of doripenem on anticonvulsive effects of valproic acid was reported in a bicuculline induced seizure model. Meropenem at doses of 100 to 1000 mg/kg appeared to attenuate responses in both seizure models. Pharmacokinetics Medicinal product no longer authorised

The pharmacokinetics of doripenem have been extensively investigated in species used in toxicology studies including juvenile animals and pregnant rat and rabbit. Limited data indicated that the methods used for determination of doripenem, band culture assay and HPLC, produced similar results.

Single dose pharmacokinetic studies following intravenous doses showed a short elimination half-life in plasma ranging from 0.1-0.3 hour in mouse, 0.1 hour in rat, 0.2-1.0 hour in rabbit and 0.7-1.2 hours in monkey.  The corresponding human value was 1 hour. Dose proportional pharmacokinetics with no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

evident gender differences were reported. No accumulation after repeated doses was seen. Exposure to the  major  metabolite,  the  dicarboxylic  acid,  was  highest  in  rat.    Further,  it  was  shown  in  a  mouse pulmonary infection model that drug levels in plasma and liver tissue were comparable to those in non-infected groups.

Doripenem had low plasma protein binding in all species with values ranging from 25, 35 (mouse, rat) to 6 and 8% (monkey, human). Tissue distribution studies indicated highest levels in plasma, kidney, liver and lung in mouse. In rat highest levels were detected in plasma, blood, trachea, skin and lung. At 2 hours post dose values had declined to below 1 µg/g except in liver, cecum, kidney and bone. In the pigmented rat initial high levels in kidney, lung, liver, blood and skin were reported. At 24 hours post  dose  values  were  less  than  0.141  µg/g  in  all  tissues  except  kidney  and  liver.  After  repeated administration in fed male rats high concentrations in kidney, plasma, blood, trachea and lung were recorded.  In  the  fed  male  dog  given  a  single  intravenous  dose  of  20  mg/kg  highest  levels  of radioactivity were detected in kidney, cecum, blood, plasma, skin, lung and tongue. Adult and juvenile dogs exhibited similar distribution.

Studies in pregnant rat showed transfer of doripenem radioactivity to the fetus. At 6 hours postdose only trace amounts of label in tissue in dams were detected but the amniotic membrane retained label. Levels in fetuses were overall low and as expected highest in blood and kidney. No cytochrome P450 dependent metabolism of doripenem was evident in microsomes. Renal DHP-1 (dehydropeptidase-I) is known to mediate cleavage of the β -lactam ring. The activity of DHP-1 was determined to  be  highest  in  tissue  from  rat  lung  and  monkey  kidney  while  liver  overall  had  lower activity.  Hydrolysis  of  doripenem  was  similar  to  imipenem  in  monkey  kidney,  but  less  than  for imipenem and meropenem in kidney tissue  from  other species.  Overall  data  were  in  line  with  that administration  of  doripenem  can  proceed  without  an  inhibitor  of  DHP-1.  The  major  metabolite  of doripenem was identified as the ring-opened product dicarboxylic acid in both rat, dog and monkey. In monkey  small  amounts  of  the  metabolite  were  found  in  plasma  and  cumulative  excretion  in  urine amounted to 24% of dose up to a 2 hour collection time. The metabolite had no biological activity. In dog and human a minor amount was further converted to taurine and glycine conjugates. Doripenem was mainly excreted in urine in all species. In rat, 93-94% was excreted in urine in 96 hours. In dog and monkey given single intravenous doses also 90-96% of dose was found in urine in 24  hours.  Radiolabelled  doripenem  was  also  excreted  into  milk  of  lactating  rat.  The  mechanism  of renal  excretion  of  carbapenems  may  differ  depending  on  species.  Doripenem  was  shown  to  be excreted by tubular secretion and glomerular filtration in rabbits and primarily by glomerular filtration in dog. Carbapenem antibiotics may decrease blood concentrations of valproic acid thereby interfering with the anticonvulsive efficacy of the drug. Carbapenems including doripenem were shown to decrease the AUC  of  valproic  acid  by  inhibiting  hydrolysis  of  the  corresponding  glucuronide.  Other  studies indicated  that  doripenem  had  little  potential  to  displace  bilirubin  from  its  binding  site.  Studies  on doripenem  interactions  with  cilastatin  in  rat  indicated  some  inhibition  of  metabolism  of  doripenem while  studies  in  monkey  were  consistent  with  that  co-administration  of  a  DHP-1  inhibitor  such  as cilastatin would not be required. Overall, the general pharmacokinetics of doripenem seemed comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and the parameters characterised indicated that species used in toxicity studies are relevant to use for evaluating the toxicity of the compound.

Table 6 . Single dose toxicity studies

Signs of renal effects were evident in rabbits after single doses of 400 mg/kg or higher. Nephrotoxicity of doripenem was further investigated in a non-GLP rabbit study and determined to be lower than for cefazoline,  cefotiam  and  cefmenoxime,  but  higher  than  for  the  carbapenem  antibiotic  tienam (imipenem/cilastatin). Target organs for toxicity in the dog after single high doses were determined the digestive tract and kidneys. · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) Rat Table 7 .

At high doses in the 'pretoxicity' study (Y-001) in rat, hypertrophy of the germinal center in the white pulp  of  spleen  was  noted.  Increased  spleen  weight  has  also  been  reported  with  imipenem  and meropenem.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  study  R-442  was  a  preliminary  fertility  study  to  determine  doses  for  the  reproduction  toxicity study. As in other studies increased cecum and spleen weight was noted in males and a trend towards increased cecum weight in females. There were no significant differences in estrus cycles or estrus periods between controls and treated groups.

In the 1 month study positive reaction in the occult blood urine test likely was due to a false positive reaction also seen in other studies. Ophthalmological and auditory examinations did not indicate any effects of treatment.

In the 5 day rabbit study, nephrotoxicity of doripenem was estimated to be similar to that of Cefotiam but  greater  than  for  Tienam.  In  a  second  5  day  study  in  rabbit  nephrotoxicity  was  estimated  to Cefmenoxamine&gt;Cefazolin=Biapenem&gt;Imipenem/cilastin&gt;Meropenem trihydrate=doripenem. In this latter study systemic exposure levels to doripenem on the first day were reported to 70.7, 138 and 333 µgxh/ml for the 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg groups, respectively.

In the 3 month rat study, body weight gain was still decreased at end of recovery period. Loose stool, cecum  enlargement  and  decreases  in  urinary  electrolytes  were  judged  related  to  the  antimicrobial activity of the compound and as such not representative of toxicity. There were occasional statistically significant changes in haematology parameters, but these were slight and did not appear dose related. Two males in the high dose group had bilateral or unilateral atrophy in the epididymides. This was also seen in one control male. Toxicokinetics of doripenem and its major metabolite were determined using HPLC in a separate 5 day repeated dose study (S-4661-TF-612-L). Tmax was 2 minutes after administration. Table 8 .

The 2 week study in rabbit was a preliminary dose finding study to estimate doses to be used in a subsequent teratology study. Some animals in groups dosed 50 mg/kg and above developed diarrhea and died.

## Dog

Table 10 . Overview of dog studies

In a 2 week range-finding study the 2 dogs at the high dose of 1000 mg/kg exhibited subcutaneous bleeding across the entire body which was attributed to a reduction in platelets. A 2 week intravenous toxicity  study  (S-4661-TF-618-L)  with  doripenem  hydrate  was  conducted  in  dog  (3M+3F/group) using doses of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg and included a direct Coomb's test. There were no treatment related findings and the Coomb's test was negative. Toxicokinetics of doripenem and its major metabolite were determined using HPLC in a separate 5 day repeated dose study (S-4661-TF-613-L). Tmax was 2 minutes after administration.

In the 2 week intravenous infusion study in dog toxicokinetic parameters were monitored. Table 12 . Toxicokinetics in the 2 week intravenous infusion study Dose (mg/kg) Cmax (µg/ml) M D1 10 45.26 30 136.16 100 479.03 Vales are 2 minutes post-dose In  the  1  month  intravenous  injection  study  (S-4661-B-14-L)  deaths  occurred  at  the  high  dose. Histopathology  of  early  deaths  showed  perivascular  hemorrhage  in  lung,  vacuolisation  epithelial  in kidney proximal tubule, hepatocyte vacuolisation, congestion in pancreas, thymus atrophy, thrombus in testes, neutrophil infiltration testes, mucosal erosion in cecum, pyloric gland erosion among other changes. The severity of gastrointestinal damage seemed reduced after repeated administrations since abnormal feces decreased in incidence towards the end of the administration period. After the recovery period body weight in high dose animals remained lower than in control animals. Reductions of RBC, HGB  and  HCT  were  considered  to  reflect  hemorrhagic  anemia  caused  by  hemorrhage  in  the gastrointestinal  tract,  but  other  causes  may  also  have  been  involved.  One  female  in  the  high  dose group was noted for decreased hematopoiesis in the bone marrow caused by poor nutritional status contributing  to  decreases  in  red  blood  cell  parameters.  Further,  haematological  parameters  showed evidence  of  recovery  mainly  in  females,  as  did  serum  chemistry  values.  Spleen  weight  remained increased  and  hypertrophy  and  erythropoietic  hyperplasia  was  recorded  in  one  female.  Kidney vacuolisation was also noted in animals in the mid and high dose group and changes were reversible. Deaths  appeared  related  to  gastrointestinal  effects,  including  erosions  or  ulcer  in  the  mucosa. Gastrointestinal damage showed reversibility during the recovery period. Changes in haematology in part reflected hemorrhage in the gastrointestinal tract. In a second 1 month toxicity study with lower doses administered twice daily there were no adverse clinical  signs  and  ophthlmological  and  electrocardiographic  examinations  were  negative.  Some changes in clinical pathology were noted, but were overall slight and showed evidence of recovery. Increased eosinophil count in males at mid dose and in high dose animals was noted but was minor and  similar  to  control  after  the  recovery  period.  Toxiocokinetics  were  determined  in  the  1  month intravenous infusion study. Table 13 .

examinations showed a tendency for prolongation of the QTc interval in mid and high dose males. There  was  also  tendency  for  prolongation  of  the  APTT  in  treated  females.  Slight  haematological changes were still  evident  after  recovery  in  the  high  dose  animals  and  hemosiderin  deposition  was increased in one male. A slight increase in alkaline phosphatase in males was present up to 3 months. Thymus hyperplasia was also seen in one control animal, but occurred at a higher incidence in treated animals. Hemorrhage and inflammatory cell infiltration in stomach were noted in females given the mid dose as well as at the high dose. One female in the high dose group had localized necrosis of the proximal tubule.

· Genotoxicity Standard tests in vitro for genotoxic activity as well as an in vivo mouse micronucleus test were negative. · Carcinogenicity No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted and such studies are not required in view of results from mutagenicity studies and the treatment duration. · Reproduction Toxicity A full range of studies to investigate potential effects on reproduction parameters was conducted using rat  and rabbit and intravenous doses of up to 1000 mg/kg. In a fertility and embryonic development study where males were treated 9 weeks prior to mating and females 2 weeks prior to mating no effects on fertility indices were reported. However, in one dog study at high doses intravenous infusion (500 to 1000  mg/kg)  degeneration  of  germinal  epithelium  and  giant  cells  in  testes  were  observed.  In  a  rat embryofoetal  study  1  to  3  dams  in  doripenem  treated  groups  had  all  pups  dead  by  day  4  after parturition  resulting  in  a  trend  for  decreased  survival  rate,  but  with  no  clear  dose-response.  The NOAEL  for  general  toxicity  in  dams  was  considered  300  mg/kg,  and  this  was  also  judged representative for reproductive toxicity inferred from a case of abnormal parturition in one animal in the  high  dose  group.  The  study  included  postnatal  development  tests  of  F1  pups  up  to  puberty  and production of F2 generation. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity and maintenance of pregnancy and nursing performance was identified as 1000 mg/kg. At this dose an effect on parturition possibly due to secondary effects linked to aggravation of clinical signs prior to parturition was reported and the NOAEL for parturition was set to 300 mg/kg. Pre and postnatal function in rats did not seem affected by doripenem treatment. In rabbits treated with doripenem no significant effects on external, skeletal and visceral anomalies of live fetuses were evident. Taken together while reproduction toxicity studies include the different stages of the reproductory process the studies seem deficient in that administration was  once  daily  likely  resulting  in  drug  holidays  and  this  should  be  reflected  in  the  information  on reproduction toxicity to be included in the SPC. Potential effects relative to fertility  and  parturition should be further considered. · Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and /or further evaluated A series of studies in juvenile animals is available. No specific toxicity in juvenile dogs not recorded in adult animals was noted. In both rat and dog studies red/brown urine was frequently noted and data were consistent that in most cases this was an artefactual reaction due to the physical characteristics of the compound. Positive results in the occult blood urine test were noted in some studies and likely this represented false positive reactions. The NOEL in two one month juvenile dog toxicity studies using once daily and twice daily administration ranged from 40 to 200 mg/kg/day. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## · Local tolerance

A local irritation study in Japanese white rabbits was conducted (S-4661-B-18-L, GLP) using bolus intravenous injection into auricular vein once per day for 8 days. Vascular irritancy was determined by an  intravenous  retention  method.  Concentrations  used  ranged  form  0.25  to  2.0%  (per  dose  volume

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

0.05 ml). Erythema and induration at all sites was noted and there were no differences in frequency or severity of findings  with the test formulation and vehicle control (physiological saline).

In another rabbit study (S-4661-B-30-L, GLP) a single bolus intramuscular injection was administered at a concentration of 1%, 1 ml at 0.1 ml/sec. Acetic acid was used as a positive control. Two days after injection  necrosis  of  muscle  fiber,  mononuclear  cell  infiltration  and  hemorrhage  and  edema  was evident, but was not considered marekedly different from that of physiological saline.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

A mouse study (TOX7610, GLP) was conducted to investigate phototoxicity. In the acute tolerance phase mice (3 females/group) were given an intravenous injection of 10, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day for 5 days followed by a 3 day observation period. A slight decrease in body weight was recorded (1-3%). In the phototoxicity phase 6 females per group were given a daily intravenous injection of doripenem up to 100 mg/kg/day for five days followed by exposure to simulated sunlight for 15 ±5 minutes. No indication  of  a  cutaneous  response  related  to  phototoxicity  was  reported  up  to  3  days  following irradiation. The positive control 8-methoxypsoralen gave expected responses. Antigenicity A passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) study (AG-1110-1) was conducted using a mouse/rat system. Mice  were  sensitised with 1  mg  doripenem  and  FCA  (Freunds  Complete  Adjuvant)  given intravenously/subcutaneously/intraperitoneally 5 days a week for 2 weeks or 2 days per week for 3 weeks  (plus  FCA)  or  3  days  per  week  for  3  weeks  (conjugate  plus  alum).  Doripenem  had  no sensitizing antigenicity in the PCA test using the BALB/c mouse, but slight eliciting antigenicity was reported.  Doripenem  had  no  sensitizing  or  eliciting  antigenicity  in  the  PCA  test  using  the  C3H/He mouse. Sensitizing antigenicity of doripenem and imipenem was noted in the ELISA (BALB/c mouse, C3H/He).  No  cross  reactivity  with  respect  to  imipenem  and  other  beta-lactam  antibiotics  was recorded. In  an  antigenicity  study  (AG-1110-2)  using  a  guinea  pig  model  and  intravenous  (doripenem  plus vehicle), subcutaneous (doripenem plus FCA)  administration doripenem exhibited sensitizing antigenicity  detected  by  the  guinea  pig  active  systemic  anaphylaxis  test  (ASA),  guinea  pig  passive cutaneous anaphylaxis test and ELISA. Eliciting antigenicity was detected by the guinea pig passive cutaneous  anaphylaxis  test  and  possible  eliciting  antigenicity  was  reported  in  the  active  systemic anaphylaxis  test  using  guinea  pig.  Imipenem  had  sensitizing  antigenicity  in  the  guinea  pig  active systemic anaphylaxis test and guinea pig passive cutaneous anaphylaxis test. Eliciting antigenicity of imipenem was detected in the guinea pig passive cutaneous anaphylaxis test. Doripenem showed weak immunological cross reactivity with imipenem. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment An environmental risk assessment was conducted in compliance with applicable guidelines and is to be updated with some additional studies. A rapid degradation in aerobic aquatic sediment systems was noted and the potential for bioaccumulation appeared low. Toxicity to early stages of zebra fish was evident at 9.2 mg/L while no specific effects on water-flea mobilization were evident at doses up to 88 mg/mL. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Pharmacokinetics

The PK and PD of doripenem were characterized in 9 clinical pharmacology studies in subjects from the Western population. In addition, one population PK analysis was performed using sparse data from one  Phase  2  study  and  two  Phase  3  studies.  Doripenem  PK  was  also  assessed  in  8  clinical pharmacology studies with subjects from the Japanese population. Penetration of doripenem in various tissues and fluids was assessed in 10 additional Phase 2 and 3 studies in Japanese subjects. Several bioanalytical methods have been used during the development program.

- Absorption

<!-- image -->

Doripenem is to be injected intravenously and bioavailability is then by definition 100%. In  the  application,  one-hour  infusions  are  recommended  for  treatment  of  patients  with  nosocomial pneumonia and four-hour infusions are recommended patients who are at risk for infection with less susceptible pathogens. Bioequivalence, in terms of exposure, has been demonstrated between the two dosing regimes. · Distribution The volume of distribution, 18 L, is approximately equal to the extracellular fluid volume in humans. Mean  serum  protein  binding  across  these  studies  was  8.1%  and  was  independent  of  serum  drug concentration. The partitioning of doripenem into red blood cells was determined to be low, based on the  blood  to  plasma  ratios  of  radioactivity  of  about  0.5.  Doripenem  penetration  into  various  body tissues  and  fluids  was  assessed  in  ten  phase  II/III  Japanese  studies.  On  an  average,  with  some exceptions,  reported  doripenem  concentrations  in  various  tissues  were ≤ 35%  of  plasma  peak concentration.  Doripenem  concentrated  into  urine  where  its  levels  exceeded  several  fold  these  of plasma. · Elimination Doripenem is excreted to a  large  part  unchanged in the urine. The  major  elimination  pathways  are filtration,  active  tubular  secretion  and  metabolism.  A  microbiologically  inactive  metabolite  of doripenem, M-1, is formed via cleavage of its β -lactam ring, likely by dehydropeptidase. In the Western population, mean doripenem CL, CLR, and Ae (% dose) were 15.9 L/hr (265 mL/min), 10.3 L/hr (170 mL/min), and 70.4%, respectively when pooled across studies. Doripenem mean renal clearance  10.3  L/hr  (170  mL/min)  exceeds  the  glomerular  filtration  rate  in  humans,  7.5  L/hr  (125 mL/min), indicating that both glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion are involved in its renal excretion. An interaction study with probenecid indicates that there is also re-absorption involved in the elimination process of doripenem. Based on the elimination data from Study DORI-NOS-1007 (metabolism and excretion of doripenem in  healthy  men  after  a  single  i.v.  dose  of 14 C-doripenem  500  mg  given  as  a  1-hour  infusion), doripenem  CL  consists  of  metabolism  via  dehydropeptidase,  filtration,  the  combination  of  active secretion and re-absorption and phase II metabolism constituting approximately 18 %, 43%, 35 % and &lt; 3 % of total CL, respectively. Urinary recovery or doripenem was complete within 24 hours post start of infusion, with a mean 78.7% and 18.2% of the administered dose recovered as doripenem and M-1, respectively.

The  PK-characteristics  of  M-1  in  subjects  with  normal  renal  function  are  well  described.  The elimination of M-1 seems not formation rate limited as the terminal half life is approximately 120 min in comparison to doripenem´s 70 minutes. There is no accumulation of M-1 in subjects with normal renal function.

- Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Doripenem  displays  linear  pharmacokinetics.  There  is  no  apparent  accumulation  of  doripenem  in plasma after doses as high as 1000 mg t.i.d. in healthy volunteers.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Variability

Inter-individual variability in systemic exposure to doripenem was generally less than 20%. Based on the population analysis, inter occasion variability on clearance and volume of distribution (Vp) was 15 % CV and 30 % CV, respectively.

- Special populations

As  doripenem  does  not  undergo  hepatic  metabolism,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  doripenem  is  not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment. No study has been performed. Two  formal  studies  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  have  been  performed.  Study  DORI-02  was performed  in  patients  with  varying  degree  of  renal  function  and  Study  DORI-NOS-1005  in haemodialysis patients. Further, the impact of renal impairment was evaluated in the Phase 2 Study DORI-03 which was included in the population PK analysis. The results obtained in DORI-02 showed that  administration  of  a  single  dose  of  500mg  subjects  with  mild,  moderate  and  severe  renal impairment resulted in approximately 1.6, 2.8 and 5.1 fold higher AUC as compared to subjects with normal  renal  function.  The  currently  proposed  dose  regimes  for  patients  with  moderate  and  severe renal impairment are a 2- and 3- fold reduction of the normal daily dose, respectively, which will not fully compensate for the decreased clearance in these patients in study DORI-02. With responses to questions raised, non-compartmental analysis of DORI-03 data were provided. The influence of renal impairment on doripenem exposure seems to be somewhat lower in this study than that observed in study DORI-02 with a 1.3 and 1.9-fold increase in exposure at 500 mg qd in mild and moderate renal impairment  on  Day  7,  which  supports  the  proposed  dose  recommendation.  Data  in  severe  renal impairment group was limited to two subjects with creatinine clearance close to 30 ml/min (25 and 29 ml/min  respectively).  Hence,  based  on  data  from  DORI-02  and  -03,  the  currently  proposed  dose reduction will not compensate for the decreased clearance in patients with severe renal impairment and it  is  expected  that  this  patient  group  will  get  a  higher  exposure  of  doripenem  compared  to  what  is expected in patients with normal renal function. Information regarding the pharmacokinetics of M-1, in relation to renal function status, was obtained from the Phase 2 cUTI study DORI-03. The data presented in the response to Day 120 LoQ clearly show  the  influence  of  renal  function  on  the  M-1  exposure  with  large  increases  in  M-1  exposure patients with creatinine clearance &lt;50 ml/min (if the dose is not adjusted). With the proposed dose adjustment the M-1 exposure will be increased in both mild and moderate renal impairment but to a moderate  extent  which  seems  acceptable.  The  data  in  severe  renal  impairment  are,  however,  very limited.  There  are  only  two  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment  and  both  these  subjects  had creatinine  clearance  &gt;25  ml/min.  Previous  data  in  dialysis  patients  (DORI-NOS-1005)  showed extremely  large  increases  in  exposure  of  M-1  (15-  fold  increase  in  AUCt  when  doripenem  was administered pre-dialysis and 39-fold increase when doripenem was administered post-dialysis with an expected much greater increase in AUC ∞ ). Hence, very large increases in M-1 exposure are expected in  patients  with  creatinine  clearance  10-20  ml/min.  Given  the  limited  safety  data  in  patients  with severe renal impairment at the proposed dose and the pharmacokinetic data which suggest increased doripenem exposure and probably very large increases in M-1 exposure, Doribax should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Doripenem  and  M-1  is  dialyzable  but  considering  the  extensive  accumulation  of  M-1,  its  use  in dialysis patients is not recommended.  Doripenem AUC and Cmax in female subjects were 13% and 15% higher, respectively, compared to the values in male subjects. Compared to Caucasians, mean doripenem  clearance  was  29%  higher  in  subjects  of  Hispanic  or  Latino  ancestry.  No  significant difference was observed for subjects of African-American ancestry. PK parameters in average were similar in Asian and Western populations. As these differences in exposure are not considered to be clinically important, no dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender, race or weight.

Pharmacokinetics of doripenem in children has not been studied.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Target population

The pharmacokinetics in patients with cUTI and NP was evaluated in a population analysis. A twocompartment  model  with  zero-order  input  and  first  order  elimination  best  described  the  plasma concentration time profile after intravenous administration of doripenem.

The  exposure  to  doripenem  was  primarily  governed  by  renal  function  status,  where  a  reduction  in renal  function  was  associated  with  a  reduction  in  clearance  to  the  drug.  Disease  state  was  not  a significant covariate and it could be concluded that there is no major difference in PK between healthy subjects and patients.

Doripenem was shown to exhibit bactericidal activity, in line with other carbapenems.

· Pharmacokinetic interaction studies The  in  vitro  studies  suggest  no  potential  for  inhibition  or  induction  of  CYP450  isoenzymes  by doripenem  and  M-1.  Doripenem  is  eliminated  through  active  tubular  secretion  but  the  transport protein/s  responsible  for  this  secretion  has  not  been  identified.  An  in-vivo  interaction  study  with concomitant administration with probenecid resulted in an increase in doripenem AUC by 75%. Based on experience with meropenem, there are indications that doripenem may reduce serum concentrations of sodium valproate to subtherapeutic levels. Pharmacodynamics Doripenem is a new beta-lactam agent of the carbapenem class, expressing an antimicrobial spectrum resembling that of meropenem. Doripenem was selected for development because of the sulfamoylamino-ethyl-pyrrolidinylthio group in its side chain at position 2 that enhances its activity against non-fermentative gram-negative rods. · Mechanism of action Like  other  beta-lactam  agents,  doripenem  acts  by  targeting  penicillin-binding  proteins  (PBPs)  to inhibit the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall. The binding of the beta-lactam molecule to the PBPs prevents  bacteria  from  completing  transpeptidation  (cross-linking)  of  peptidoglycan  strands,  thus preventing the synthesis of an intact bacterial cell wall. The metabolite of doripenem, M1, has been shown to be microbiologically inactive. · Primary and Secondary pharmacology Doripenem exhibits a broad-spectrum bactericidal antibacterial activity against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Of approximately 10,000 recent worldwide clinical isolates tested, the majority of species, including most β -lactamase-producing organisms, had a MIC90 value of ≤ 1 µg/mL. Doripenem is less active against Enterococcus faecalis and certain non-fermentative gramnegative  bacteria,  and  inactive  against  most  isolates  of  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus  aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecium , Corynebacterium spp., and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Doripenem is slightly  less  active  than  imipenem,  but  more  active  than  meropenem  and  ertapenem, against gram-positive bacteria. Against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of doripenem is similar to that of meropenem, and similar to or more active than imipenem and ertapenem. Doripenem seems to be slightly more (1-2 fold) potent against Pseudomonas isolates than imipenem or meropenem. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Although the spectrum of activity of carbapenems is very broad, some organisms demonstrate intrinsic resistance. The poor binding affinity of all beta-lactams to PBP2a in meticillin resistant staphylococci (e.g.  MRSA)  and  to  PBP5  in E.  faecium render  these  bacteria  to  be  intrinsically  resistant  to  all carbapenems developed so far. Like imipenem and meropenem, doripenem susceptibility is generally not affected by common cephalosporinases, including the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), while the susceptibility is markedly decreased for organisms producing carbapenemases, such as KPS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

enzymes  and metallo-betalactamases. Acinetobacter spp. positive for the  classD  OXA  betalactamases, do also express reduced susceptibility. In addition, AmpC overproduction combined with loss  of  OprD  in Pseudomonas spp.,  results  in  increased  MIC-values  to  doripenem,  as  for  other carbapenems. Thus, the vulnerability  for  beta-lactamase  encoded  resistance  as  well  as  permeability and  efflux  mediated  resistance  for  doripenem,  seems  to  be  in  line  with  that  of  other  carbapenems, especially  meropenem.  A combination of several of these mechanisms is often present in resistant gram-negative strains. For gram-positive bacteria, reduced affinity for altered PBPs remains the most common resistance mechanism.

Two studies, using checker-board assays, indicated that combinations of doripenem and glycopeptides were  synergistic  or  additive  for  tested  clinical  MRSA  strains.  It  was  demonstrated  that  doripenem could  be  combined  with  a  range  of  antimicrobials  without  risk  of  antagonism,  suggesting  that  coadministration with other agents would not lead to loss of activity. Pooled susceptibility data from cUTI, IAI and NP infections from the current clinical studies revealed that  MIC90-values  were ≤ 0.5 µg/mL  for  all gram-negative  isolates regardless of resistance mechanisms, except for Morganella morganii and non-fermentative organisms. Among gram-positive organism, the activity of doripenem was somewhat poorer, but MIC90 values against streptococci and methicillin  susceptible  staphylococci  (MSSA)  were  consistently  low, ≤ 0.5  µg/mL.  This  is  in accordance with previous surveillance data and very similar to the activity of meropenem. Molecular typing of pre- and post treatment isolates, revealed pairs of isolates that exhibited &gt; 4-fold increases in doripenem MIC during doripenem treatment, mainly P. aeruginosa from the NP studies. Resistance  development  during  doripenem  treatment  was  in  line  with  that  of  imipenem  treated subjects.    The  resistance  was  probably  due  to  multiple  mechanisms  as  would  be  expected  for  a carbapenem. Increased levels of AmpC β -lactamase activities were demonstrated, but could not fully explain  the  decreased  susceptibility.  Efflux/permeability  likely  played  a  role  and  requires  further investigation. The applicant is asked to submit final results regarding the mechanisms of resistance in these pairs of isolates. As with other carbapenems, animal model studies have demonstrated that time (T) &gt;MIC is the best predictor of microbiologic outcome (key pharmacodynamic index) for doripenem. Animal models as the  neutropenic  thigh  model  and  human  population  PK  designated  the  conservative  target  of  35% T&gt;MIC, which predicted that 500 mg of doripenem administered for 1 h every 8 h would be effective against  organisms  with  an  MIC  &lt;2  µg/ml,  and  that  less  susceptible  strains  could  be  treated  with prolonged  (4  h)  infusions.  Clinical  species  specific  and  non-species  related  breakpoints  based  on PK/PD variables and epidemiological cut-off vales will be established in cooperation with EUCAST. The  Applicant  has  provided  data  in  support  of  tentative  breakpoints,  which  have  been  preliminary used for the analyses in this dossier.

However,  a  target  attainment  of  35%  T  &gt;  MIC  might  not  be  optimal  for  all  patients  since  it  is calculated for bacteriostatic effect, which may not be sufficient in seriously ill patients with impaired immune defence. Extending the infusion time of doripenem to 4 hours maximizes the %T&gt;MIC for a given dose and is the basis for the option to administer 4-hour infusions in patients with nosocomial pneumonia including ventilator-associated pneumonia. As a precaution in this group of seriously ill and often immunocompromised patients, 40-50% T&gt;MIC would likely be more warranted. Based on PK/PD data aiming at least 95% of patients achieving 50% T &gt; MIC,  four-hour infusion should be recommended for isolates with MIC ≥ 0.5 mg/l (Figure 7 below (Module 2.7.2.4) and Tables 3 and 4, Appendix 2.1, Target attainment report).

Overall, there were limited numbers of isolates with doripenem MICs in the 8-16 µg/ml range from the clinical studies. MIC values of the isolates from the clinical studies were not clearly predicttive for clinical failure. The Applicant has not performed any study on the impact of doripenem on the normal microflora. The effect of doripenem on QT/QTc was assessed by measuring the time-matched mean differences in ∆ QTcF  between  doripenem  treatments  at  therapeutic  and  supratherapeutic  doses  and  placebo  in  a randomized,  double-blind  Phase  I  study  in  60  healthy  adults  (DORI-NOS-1001).  Neither  dose  of doripenem had a significant effect on QT/QTc and no relationship between ∆ QTcF and doripenem concentration was observed in either the 500 mg or 1000 mg treatment groups. Clinical efficacy The clinical efficacy of doripenem for the indications cUTIs, cIAIs and NP was studied in one Phase 2 study and in 6 multi-center Phase 3 studies. Three of the Phase 3 studies were double-blinded studies with  active  comparators,  whereas  the  other  three  were  open  labeled,  of  which  two  with  active comparators. Overall, the design of the clinical trials was in agreement with current guidelines. The highlights and main features across the studies are presented in the table below.

Two doses of doripenem (250 mg/q8h or 500 mg/q8h) were given as one hour infusion for 7 to 14 days. The 1:1 randomisation was used and the primary objective was to compare the microbiological response rate in patients with cUTI at Days 5 to 9 post-therapy. The secondary objectives included clinical response at days 5 to 9, safety of doripenem and obtaining pharmacokinetics data. The populations and evaluation criteria  were  similar  to  those  used  in  cUTI  studies  (see  below  under  cUTI  studies).  The  study randomised 121 patients of which 107 (55 in 250 mg/q8h and 52 in 500 mg/q8h group) completed the study (mMITT population). The demographic findings in both groups were similar.

The  microbiological  eradication  rate  was  slightly  greater  in  patients  who  received  the  dose  of  500 mg/q8h  than  in  those  given  dose  of  250  mg/q8h  (68%  vs  64%,  respectively).  There  was  a  higher eradication rate of the most common pathogen, E. coli , in the 500 mg arm (25/31; 81%) versus (24/35; 69%) in the 250 mg arm. The combined per pathogen eradication rates at TOC for all of the most frequently isolated organisms typically found in cUTI infections ( E. coli , P. mirabilis , K. pneumoniae ,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

S.  saprophyticus , E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa )  were  82%  and  69%  in  the  500 mg  and  250 mg treatment arms, respectively.

Secondary  outcome  measures  250  mg/q8h  vs  500  mg/q8h  were  Microbiological  response  at  TOC (mMITT) - 59% vs 64%, clinical response at TOC (CE at TOC) - 93% vs 90%, clinical response at TOC (cMITT) - 82% vs 84%, clinical response at TOC (ME at TOC) - 93% vs 90%, clinical response at LFU (CE at LFU) - 80% vs 78%, microbiological response at LFU (ME at LFU) - 47% vs 55%, and clinical response at LFU (ME at LFU) - 79% vs 74%.

The safety profiles of the 2 doripenem dosing regimens were similar. In both groups 6 new pathogens emerged at TOC visit, in both groups there were 2 Gram-negative organisms, rest of them were Grampositives or Candida . The most common AEs were headache (11.6%) and gastrointestinal disorders, including constipation, diarrhoea, and dyspepsia, each reported by 5.0% of patients. For the indications cIAI and NP no formal dose finding studies have been conducted. Therefore the final choice of dose is mainly based on PK/PD approaches (see above).  As highlighted in the SPC there is an option to prolong the duration of infusion (500mg given over 4 hours) in NP patients in order  to  cover  less  susceptible  pathogens,  such  as P.  aeruginosa .    PK/PD  data  indicate  that  1g  q8 hours,  administered  during  4  hours,  may  further enhance the  efficacy  for  pathogens  with  decreased susceptibility, although clinical efficacy and safety data for this regimen is currently lacking. · Main study(ies) Complicated Urinary tract infection (cUTI) Study DORI-05 and Study DORI Methods (DORI-05 and DORI-06) have a similar study design, with the important exception that only DORI-05 included an active comparator, while DORI-06 was an open single arm study where the levofloxacin arm from DORI-05 was used for comparative analyses. The DORI-06 study was designed to provide independent supportive confirmation of the response rate for doripenem observed in the double-blind, levofloxacin-controlled study in cUTI (DORI-05). · Study Participants Male and female patients of 18 years of age or older, with a confirmed diagnosis of complicated lower urinary tract infections or pyelonephritis (complicated or uncomplicated) were included in the studies. Exclusion criteria for both studies (DORI-05 and DORI-06) included a history of moderate or severe hypersensitivity reactions to carbapenems, penicillins, other beta-lactam antibiotics, or any quinolone, a  complete permanent obstruction of the urinary tract, a confirmed fungal UTI with a colony count greater than or equal to 10 3 CFU/mL, a suspected or confirmed perinephric or intrarenal abscess and suspected or confirmed prostatitis.

Patients  were  defined  as  having  completed  the  study  if  they  had  received  study  drug  therapy  as directed during the 10 days of treatment and had attended the TOC and LFU visits as specified in the protocol. At the time of a possible study withdrawal, EOT (i.v.) visit procedures were performed if the patient was on i.v. study drug therapy, and TOC visit procedures were performed if the patient was on oral levofloxacin.

## · Treatments

In study DORI-05 patients were randomised to receive either doripenem as a 1-hour i.v. infusion (500 mg q8h) or levofloxacin, administered as a 1-hour i.v. infusion (250 mg q24h).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In study DORI-06 all subjects received doripenem +/- oral levofloxacin according to the protocol of DORI-05.

The total treatment duration (i.v. and oral) in both studies was 10 days. However, 14 days was allowed for subjects with documented bacteraemia at study entry.

Patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  were  excluded  from  this  study.  Any  patient  who  required dialysis  after  enrollment  was  removed  from  study  drug  therapy.  The  doripenem  dose  was  adjusted according to renal function.

A  blood  sample  for  culture  was  obtained  at  screening  from  patients  who  presented  with  clinical signs/symptoms  of  pyelonephritis  or  bacteremia  and  from  all  catheterized  patients  from  whom  the baseline urine culture specimen was obtained through the catheter, and on Day 2 if the screening blood culture  was  positive.  Repeat  blood  cultures  were  taken  approximately  every  24  hours  until  2 consecutive cultures obtained on separate days were without growth. In addition, blood cultures were performed at anytime signs/symptoms of sepsis were present.

Levofloxacin  was  adjusted  in  case  of  renal  impairment  according  to  labeling  and  current  clinical practice. Patients who were bacteraemic with the same uropathogen responsible for the current cUTI may have continued in the study if no concomitant systemic antibacterial therapy was required. · Objectives In studies DORI-05 and DORI-06 the primary objective of the studies was to compare the safety and to  demonstrate equivalent efficacy of doripenem to that of levofloxacin in the treatment of patients with cLUTI and pyelonephritis. In order to establish the non-inferiority of doripenem to levofloxacin in the single-armed study DORI-06, levofloxacin data from DORI-05, for the per-patient microbiological cure rates (in the co-primary analysis sets and per patient microbiological cure rates by subgroups) and the key secondary efficacy endpoint clinical cure rate in the CE at TOC analysis set were presented. Other efficacy outcomes from study DORI-06 were described without comparisons. · Outcomes/endpoints Primary endpoints were per-patient microbiological cure rate at the TOC  visit  in the microbiological evaluable (ME) at TOC analysis set and per-patient microbiological cure rate in the microbiological modified intent-to-treat (mMITT) analysis set (mMITT\\_1) at the TOC visit. Secondary endpoints and analyses included clinical cure rate in the clinically evaluable at TOC (CE at TOC) analysis set and per-baseline uropathogen microbiological outcomes for E. coli. Additional secondary analyses included per-patient microbiological cure rate in subgroups: symptomatic  and  asymptomatic  cLUTI,  pyelonephritis  (including  complicated  pyelonephritis),  and patients  who  had  concurrent  bacteraemia  at  baseline,  sustained  microbiological  cure  rate  (i.e., sustained eradication of all baseline pathogens) in the ME at LFU analysis set, sustained clinical cure rate  in  the  CE  at  LFU  analysis  set,  occurrence  of  emergent  infections  (superinfections  and  new infections), per-patient microbiological cure rate and the clinical improvement rate at EOT(i.v.), time to defervescence while on i.v. study drug therapy in patients in the CE at TOC analysis set who had fever at study entry, time to negative urine culture in the ME at TOC analysis set and time to meeting criteria to switch from i.v. to oral therapy in the CE at TOC analysis set. Sampling for culture procedures A urine sample for culture was obtained at baseline and after administration of the third dose of i.v. study drug therapy of each day until two consecutive urine cultures were reported with no growth at 24 hours or growth with a colony count less than 10 4 CFU/mL.

## Evaluation of microbiological response

Microbiological outcome (by pathogen) and response (by patient) were determined at the EOT(IV), TOC,  and  LFU  visits.  An  overall  per-patient  microbiological  response  was  determined  based  on individual microbiological outcomes  for each baseline pathogen. For the patient to have a microbiological cure, all baseline pathogens had to be eradicated at the specified visit.

Definitions of per-pathogen microbiological outcomes were:

Eradication (EOT(i.v.), TOC) :  The last interpretable urine culture result from a specimen found at entry reduced to less than 10 4 CFU/mL.

DORI-05: The original study sample size of 450 patients which was based on previous cUTI studies on oral levofloxacin treatment of cUTIs, were revised after interim evaluation of blinded data from the DORI-05 study, according to Amendment 4. Data indicated that approximately 66% of the randomly assigned  patients  met  the  criteria  to  be  included  in  the  ME  at  TOC  analysis  set  and  the  overall microbiological cure rate was approximately 84%. Estimation of sample size based on these interim data and a decision to increase the a priori power from 80% to 85% at the (1-sided) 2.5% significance level, indicated that approximately 248 patients per study arm were required to meet the criteria for inclusion in the ME at TOC analysis set in order to demonstrate non-inferiority of i.v. doripenem to i.v. levofloxacin. In order to achieve this and assuming a 66% evaluability rate, a revised sample size of approximately 750 patients was enrolled.

Persistence (EOT(i.v.), TOC) : At least 1 interpretable urine culture result from a specimen ≥ 10 4 CFU/mL of the original uropathogen(s). Sustained  Eradication  (LFU): An  interpretable  urine  culture  result  from  a  specimen  at  LFU where baseline pathogens remained less than 10 4 CFU/mL. Recurrence (LFU): An interpretable urine culture result from a specimen obtained any time after documented eradication at the TOC visit, up to and including the LFU visit, grew greater than or equal to 10 4 CFU/mL of the original uropathogen. Indeterminate (EOT(i.v.), TOC, LFU): No urine culture was obtained, or the culture result could not be interpreted for any reason. Evaluation of clinical response Clinical signs and/or symptoms of cUTI, including dysuria, frequency, suprapubic pain, urgency, or flank pain/costovertebral angle tenderness, were assessed at screening to obtain a pre-infection status score. These signs and symptoms were also assessed on each study day while the patient was receiving IV study drug therapy, and at the EOT( i.v. ), TOC, and LFU visits. Definitions of clinical outcomes were: Clinical Cure (TOC): Patients had resolution or improvement of signs or symptoms of cUTI, or return to pre-infection baseline (if known) at the TOC visit, such that no additional antibacterial therapy was required for the treatment of the current infection. Improvement (EOT(i.v.)): Patients had resolution or improvement of signs or symptoms of cUTI since before the first dose of study drug therapy. Clinical Failure (EOT(i.v.), TOC): Patients had no apparent response to therapy, persistence of signs  and/or  symptoms  of  cUTI  infection,  such  that  use  of  additional  antibacterial  therapy  was required for the current infection. Sustained  Clinical  Cure  (LFU): All  pre-therapy  signs  and  symptoms  showed  no  evidence  of resurgence after administration of the last dose of study drug therapy. Clinical  Relapse  (LFU): Signs  and/or  symptoms  of  cUTI  that  were  absent  at  the  TOC  visit reappeared at LFU. Indeterminate (EOT(i.v.),TOC, LFU): No  determination  of  clinical  response  (improvement  or failure) could not be made. · Sample size Medicinal product no longer authorised

DORI-06: The aim of DORI-06 was to provide an independent confirmation of the microbiological cure rate for doripenem observed in DORI-05, by establishing non-inferiority of doripenem compared

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with  the  levofloxacin  treatment  arm  in  DORI-05.  For  this  objective,  a  sample  size  close  to  that expected in each treatment arm in DORI-05 was selected for DORI-06.

## · Randomisation

In study DORI-05 eligible patients were randomized to treatment according to a computer-generated randomization  code.  Randomization  was  stratified  by  region  (North  America,  South  America,  or Europe) and, within each region, stratification by baseline diagnosis (symptomatic cLUTI, asymptomatic cLUTI, or pyelonephritis). In addition, within the combinations of region and baseline diagnosis, patients were randomly assigned to a treatment arm by the order in which study drug was infused.

mMITT\\_1: all patients who met the criteria for inclusion in the mMITT analysis set, including those who did not have an interpretable urine culture result available after completing study drug therapy. Indeterminate cultures were considered failures.

· Blinding (masking) In  study  DORI-05  the  study  was  conducted  double-blinded,  thus  both  study  personnel  (with  the exception of the pharmacist) and patients remained blinded to study drug therapy assignment. Since doripenem  and  levofloxacin  required  different  administration  in  terms  of  volume  and  interval,  a double-dummy  design  approach  was  implemented  with  normal  saline  infusions  to  match  the doripenem  and  levofloxacin  administration.  Unblinding  of  study  drug  therapy  assignment  was permitted only in situations when knowledge of the treatment received was absolutely necessary for patient management. · Statistical methods The primary efficacy analysis was to test the hypothesis of non-inferiority of i.v. doripenem to i.v. levofloxacin. While DORI-05 was a double-blind comparative study enabling this analysis, the results from  DORI-06,  which  was  a  single-armed  study,  were  compared  with  the  levofloxacin  arm  from DORI-05.  Non-inferiority  was  to  be  concluded  if  the  lower  bound  of  the  2-sided  95%  CI  for  the difference  (doripenem  minus  levofloxacin  in  the  proportion  of  patients  who  were  classified  as microbiological cures) was greater than or equal to -10%. This 2-sided 95% CI was obtained using the continuity-adjusted  normal  approximation  to  the  difference  between  2  binomial  proportions  (Wald method).  Analysis  of  the  per-patient  microbiological  response  in  the  mMITT-1  analysis  set  was considered a co-primary analysis. A sensitivity analysis was performed for the primary endpoint by adjusting for the effects of the baseline cUTI  diagnosis (cLUTI  or pyelonephritis) on the microbiological response. This analysis was performed using a continuity-adjusted Cochran-MantelHaenszel (CMH)-type method weighted by the sample sizes. Efficacy analyses were performed on the following study populations (DORI-05 and DORI-06): Intent-to-Treat (ITT): All randomly assigned patients who received any dose of study drug therapy. Safety analyses, but not efficacy analyses, were conducted in this analysis set. Microbiological Modified Intent-to-Treat (mMITT): All randomly assigned patients who received any dose of study drug therapy and who had a study-qualifying pre-treatment urine culture, whether or not they met the protocol definition of cUTI were met or not. Two different mMITT analysis sets were evaluated. Medicinal product no longer authorised mMITT\\_2:    patients  without  interpretable  urine  culture  result  after  completing  study  drug  therapy were excluded.

Microbiologically Evaluable at Test-of-cure (ME at TOC): All randomly assigned patients who met the protocol definition of cUTI, had a bacterial uropathogen isolated from a study-qualifying baseline

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

urine culture, had no entry criteria or in-study protocol deviation likely to impact the microbiological outcome, were compliant with study drug therapy or were classified as an evaluable microbiological failure after completing at least 3 days of i.v. study drug therapy and had an interpretable urine culture result from a specimen obtained in the appropriate TOC window.

Microbiological Evaluable at Late Follow-up (ME at LFU):  Patients in the ME at TOC analysis set with an interpretable urine culture result at the LFU visit and who did not have any confounding event or receive any systemic antibacterial therapy with potential activity against the baseline uropathogen(s)  between  the  time  of  the  TOC  and  LFU  visits,  except  resuming  oral  antimicrobial prophylaxis therapy after the TOC urine culture was obtained.

## · Recruitment

Clinically Evaluable at Test-of-cure (CE at TOC): This analysis set was similar to the ME at TOC analysis set except a clinical outcome assessment in the appropriate TOC window was required and an interpretable  urine  culture  result  at  TOC  was  not.  Patients  who  were  classified  as  having  an asymptomatic cLUTI at study entry because they had an indwelling catheter, a urinary obstruction, or a  neurogenic  bladder  and  did  not  experience  symptoms  of  dysuria,  frequency,  suprapubic  pain,  or urgency were excluded from this analysis set. Clinically Evaluable at Late Follow-up (CE at LFU): Patients in the CE at TOC analysis set who were evaluated clinically at the LFU. Two populations, ME at TOC and mMITT-1 at TOC were used as primary analysis sets. Results · Participant flow Discontinuation information for each study (DORI-05 and DORI-06) ITT analysis sets.

## · Conduct of the study

DORI-05 : The original study protocol was dated 23 September 2003. Five amendments were made; Amendment  1  was  implemented  09  February  2004  after  enrolment  of  the  first  two  patients  and reflected information learned from preparation of the final clinical study report for the Phase 2 study in cUTI (DORI-03) and discussions at investigator meetings. This amendment concerned among other issues  changes  in  duration  of  study  drug  from  7-10  days  to  10  days,  in  order  to  comply  with prescribing practice for levofloxacin, and revised visit windows at TOC and LFU. Amendment 2 (31 August  2004)  reflected  a  change  in  the  dosing  regimen  for  patients  with  impaired  renal  function, added  Canada  as  a  country  where  the  study  could  be  conducted,  and  provided  clarification  to investigator  comments  and  commonly  asked  questions.  Amendment  3  (10  February  2005)  was  an administrative amendment. Amendment 4 (18 April 2005) was made in order to increase the sample size;  to  strengthen  and  clarify  methods  to  prevent,  detect,  and  report  pregnancies;  and  to  exclude patients  with  asymptomatic  cLUTI.  Finally,  Amendment  5  (15  September  2005)  led  to  a  further increase the sample size from 580 to approximately 750 patients.

DORI-06: The original study protocol was dated 29 October 2003. The same five amendments as for study DORI-05 was implemented for DORI-06 (Amendments 1 to 5). Thus the study protocols for the two studies were essential similar (except for the single armed nature of DORI-06). · Baseline data Treatment groups in DORI-05, doripenem and levofloxacin, were generally well matched with regard to demographic characteristics such as age, weight, sex, race and baseline disease diagnosis at entry. Since the results of DORI-06 was compared to the levofloxacin arm of study DORI-05, the validity of the  analyses is dependent  on  the  similarity of patients  underlying  demographic  and  disease characteristics  between  the  treatment  arms.  Some  differences  were  a  significant  larger  number  of Caucasians in DORI-05 compared to DORI-06; 79% vs. 48%, largely depending on lower recruitment of patients in Europe in DORI-06. Notable, only one patient was included in Europe in DORI-06. The relative frequency of patients with a baseline diagnosis of cLUTI or pyelonephritis was comparable between the two treatment arms. However, for the cLUTI diagnosis, there were differences between the studies regarding the reasons for complications. In DORI-06, fewer subjects had instrumentation, obstructive uropathy and urogenital surgery compared to patients in DORI-05. It appears that subjects in  DORI-05  more  often  suffered  from  multiple  complicating  factors.  On  the  other  hand,  a  higher percentage of subjects in DORI-06 had bacteraemia at entry. Regarding baseline renal function, 18% in DORI-06 and 13% in DORI-05 had moderate or severe renal impairment, CrCL &lt;50 mL/min.  The percentage of ME at TOC patients was clearly higher in DORI-05 than in DORI-06. · Extent of drug exposure The  pooled  extent  of  exposure  data  results  were  similar  to  those  in  the  individual  studies,  with  a median duration of total study drug therapy (10 days), i.v. therapy (5 days), and oral therapy (7 days). In the doripenem treatment arm, 16% of subjects received i.v. study drug therapy only, compared with 18% in the levofloxacin treatment arm. The median duration of exposure for subjects who received i.v. study drug therapy only was 11 days. For  subjects  who  were  switched  to  oral  study  drug  therapy,  the  mean  duration  of  i.v.  study  drug therapy was 5 days before switching to oral therapy and the total mean duration of therapy was 10 days.

## Baseline uropathogens:

The distribution of baseline uropathogens was generally similar in the two treatment arms in DORI05, and in DORI-06. The most common baseline uropathogen isolated from patients overall was E. coli , of which 11% were resistant to levofloxacin while none to doripenem.

Baseline uropathogens and susceptibility characteristics in the mMITT population (DORI-05 and DORI 06).

a N is the number of subjects with the specified baseline isolate. NT is the number of subjects with the specified baseline isolate tested for which an interpretation of susceptibility results was available. For doripenem, pathogens were considered Susceptible(S), Intermediate(I) or Resistant(R) if the MIC level was ≤ 4µg/mL, = 8 µg/mL or ≥ 16 µg/mL, respectively. For levofloxacin, the number Susceptible, Intermediate or Resistant was defined according to the CLSI recommendations Blood isolates The most common uropathogen isolated from patients who were bacteremic at baseline was E. coli : 16 of 20 pathogens in the DORI-05 doripenem treatment arm and 20 of 23 in the levofloxacin treatment arm.  In  DORI-06,  22  of  27  uropathogens  associated  with  bacteraemia  were E.  coli. None  of  the baseline  pathogens  isolated  from  both  the  blood  and  urine  of  patients  in  either  treatment  arm  was resistant to any of the study drug received.

The microbiological cure rates between the treatment arms for patients within the study-population of the original protocol were consistent with the results from the final population. Secondary efficacy endpoints Clinical cure rates at TOC overall and per subgroup are summarized as follows: DORI-05: Per-Patient Clinical Cure Rates at TOC: Overall and by diagnosis (CE at TOC Analysis Set) DORI-06: Per-Patient Clinical Cure Rates at TOC: Overall and by Subgroups (CE at TOC Analysis Set). (Data on levofloxacin originates from DORI-05). Outcome per symptom For each symptom assessed, responses were similar between the treatment arms. Approximately, 94% to 99% of the patients in all three treatment arms (DORI-05 and DORI-06) indicated improvement in symptoms of dysuria, flank pain/costovertebral tenderness, frequency, suprapubic pain, and urgency at the  EOT(i.v.)  visit,  and  95%  to  100%  indicated  improvement  at  the  TOC  visit  indicating  that  the majority of patients had improvement in individual symptoms while receiving i.v. study drug therapy.

## Outcome at EOT

At  the  EOT(i.v.),  microbiological  cure  in  the  ME  at  TOC  population  was  demonstrated  in  99.6%100% of the doripenem-treated patients and in 88% of the levofloxacin-treated patients. In DORI-05, clinical  improvement  at  EOT(i.v.)  in  the  CE  at  TOC  analysis  set  was  98%  of  doripenem-treated patients  and  93%  of  levofloxacin-treated  patients,  while  in  DORI-06,  clinical  improvement  at EOT(i.v.) was demonstrated in 99% of the patients. Although doripenem-treated patients had slightly

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

better  outcome  than  those  treated  with  levofloxacin,  some  doripenem-treated  subjects  who  were infected with levofloxacin-resistant pathogens failed when switched to oral therapy. These microbiological  failures  may  thus  be  caused  by  the  too  short  duration  of    iv  doripenem  therapy  in combination with an inappropriate oral agent. Although these studies were not designed to identify optimal treatment duration of iv doripenem they indicate that 3 to 4 days may not be sufficient and longer treatment period may be required. The data also suggest that when subjects are switched to oral therapy only agents to which initial organism is susceptible should be used.

Outcome at LFU The sustained microbiological cure rate among patients who were ME at LFU and had eradication of all baseline uropathogens at the TOC visit was 89% and 87% for doripenem-treated patients in DORI05 and DORI-06, respectively, and 90% for levofloxacin, respectively. The sustained clinical cure rate at  LFU, based on patients classified as clinically cured at the TOC visit, was 91% and 95% for doripenem and levofloxacin, respectively in DORI-05 and 89% in DORI06. Other secondary variables For other secondary variables, similar results were recorded between the different treatment regimens; time to defervescence (9-10 hours for doripenem patients and 16 hours for levofloxacin), median time to negative urine culture (2 days in all three treatment arms) and median time to meeting criteria to switch  to  oral  therapy  (4-5  days  in  doripenem  treated  patients  and  5  days  in  levofloxacin  treated patients). Efficacy in subgroups The microbiological outcome per patient and subgroup were similar between the two treatment arms in DORI-05 and correspondingly in DORI-06. For the subset of ME at TOC patients who received IV study drug only, the microbiological cure rate at  TOC  was  66% (56/85) for  pooled  doripenem-treated  patients  and  38% (18/48)  for  levofloxacintreated patients. Generally, a higher percentage of levofloxacin resistant E.coli was isolated from i.v. drug only subjects, compared to the total population (39% vs 11 %). For patients  with  reduced iv  study  drug  due  to  renal  impairment,  75%  (54/72)  had  microbiological cure at TOC in the pooled ME doripenem population compared to 58% (15/26) in the levofloxacin arm. Per pathogen eradication The  per  pathogen  eradication  rates  at  TOC  (ME-population)  were  similar  between  the  two  cUTI studies and are presented as pooled data for DORI-05 and DORI-06. Eradication rates for all baseline uropathogens at the TOC visit for the ME at TOC.  Pooled data from DORI-05 and DORI-06 (Data only for pathogens isolated from at least 10 doripenem subjects).

For subjects with E. coli isolated from both urine and blood at baseline, the eradication rates at the TOC visit were similar between the 2 treatment arms, with blood eradication rates of 100% in both treatment arms, and urine eradication rates of 97.4% (37/38) and 95.0% (19/20) for the doripenem and levofloxacin treatment arms, respectively, in the pooled ME at TOC analysis set. Outcome by baseline pathogen and susceptibility More than 95% of all tested gram-negative isolates had a doripenem MIC ≤ 0.5  µg/mL at baseline. There were too few doripenem resistant microorganisms to draw any conclusion of MIC-values and outcomes,  while  levofloxacin  resistance  was  predictive  for  the  outcome  in  levofloxacin  treated patients.    Seven  baseline  microorganisms  in  doripenem-treated  patients  (pooled  data)  in  the  ME  at TOC  analysis  set  had  a  MIC  greater  than  2  µg/mL  for  doripenem  (6 P.aeruginosa (MIC  4-≥ 16 µg/mL) of which four were eradicated, and one Serratia marcescens (MIC= 8 µg/mL) which was not eradicated).  All E.  coli isolates  were  susceptible  to  doripenem  while  approximately  11%  of E.  coli isolates were resistant to levofloxacin, according to CLSI breakpoints. Among  patients  assessed  as  microbiological  failures,  most  of  the  doripenem  treated  patients  were infected  with  a  doripenem  susceptible  uropathogen,  whereas  in  failures  in  the  levofloxacin  group, fluoroquinolones resistance was common.

## Emergence of resistance

Three patients in the doripenem treatment arm (DORI-05) and six patients in DORI-06 had persistent uropathogens that developed a 4-fold increase in MIC to doripenem; Enterococcus faecalis (n=1), E. coli (n=3), Enterobacter cloacae (n=2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1) and S.  marcescens (n=1).  Only  the P.  aeruginosa strain  had  a  MIC  greater  than  1  µg/mL  (&gt;2.0 µg/mL). In addition, for two of the E. coli isolates from DORI-05, MIC to levofloxacin increased 4fold, up to 16 and 32 µg/mL, respectively. In the levofloxacin arm, 11 patients had persistent infection caused by uropathogens that had developed resistance to levofloxacin during therapy. In none of these isolates was an increased MIC for doripenem detected.

Emergent infections Only three superinfecting organisms (one in doripenem arms and two in levofloxacin arm) were tested for susceptibility. These were all resistant to the treating agent. Summary of Emergent Uropathogens (superinfections [during therapy] and new infections [after end of treatment]). Pooled data from DORI-05 and DORI-06. In the pooled doripenem group, four of the new infections were caused by doripenem-resistant strains , one Enterococcus avium and three P. aeruginosa strains. In the levofloxacin arm, there were five new infections caused by levofloxacin-resistant organisms (two E. faecalis and one each of P. mirabilis , E. coli , and P. aeruginosa ). If emergent  infections occurring during  TOC  visit  window  were  considered  as  failures,  the microbiological eradication rate (primary efficacy end-point) with doripenem was numerically lower than that with levofloxacin (ME at TOC population at TOC in the pooled analysis 77.5% vs 82.6%, respectively;  95%  CI  -11.2;  0.9)  suggesting  that  despite  the  excellent in  vitro activity, in  vivo doripenem  might  be  less  efficacious  than  levofloxacin.  This  all  indicates  that  doripenem  might effectively  eradicate  original  micro-organisms  but  this  effect  is  short-lasting  and  the  re-  or  new infections are common after the therapy is discontinued.

## Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI)

## Study DORI  07 and Study DORI  08

The study designs used in DORI-07 and DORI-08 were identical, but the two studies were performed as individual studies and at different study sites.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

Both studies are multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies that compared the efficacy and safety of  doripenem  with  that  of  meropenem  in  adult  patients  with  a  confirmed  diagnosis  of  complicated intraabdominal infection (cIAI).

The  patients  were  males  or  females  aged  18  years  or  older  and  presented  either  localized  or generalized peritonitis secondary to appendix perforation, small or large bowel perforation, cholecystitis,  or  parenchymal  (e.g.,  liver  or  spleen)  abscesses.  Patients  who  had  a  requirement  for surgical intervention (e.g., laparotomy, laparoscopic surgery, or percutaneous draining of an abscess) within 24 hours of study entry were also included. Exclusion criteria included intra-abdominal processes in which the primary etiology was not likely to have been infectious (e.g. abdominal wall abscess; small bowel obstruction or ischemic bowel disease without  perforation;  traumatic  bowel  perforation  with  surgery  within  12  hours;  perforation  of gastroduodenal ulcers with surgery within 24 hours). · Treatments The meropenem dosage regimen of 1 g q8h was chosen according to guidelines and clinical practice. The dosing schedule was as follows: initially, meropenem (1 g) or meropenem placebo (20 mL) was administered as an i.v. bolus (over 3 to 5 minutes) followed by doripenem (500 mg) or doripenem placebo i.v. infusion (100-mL bag) over 1 hour q8h. Patients could be switched to oral therapy with amoxicillin /clavulanate (875/125 mg twice daily) after 9 or more doses of IV study drug therapy, if body  temperature  and  WBC  count  were  decreased  relative  to  pre-treatment  values  (if  increased  at baseline),  if  signs/symptoms  of  cIAI  were  absent/improved  relative  to  those  before  the  start  of  i.v. study drug therapy, and if normal bowel function had returned. Additional treatment with open-label vancomycin was permitted if Enterococcus spp. or methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was suspected causative pathogens at baseline. If, after 14 days of study drug therapy, a patient continued to have clinical symptoms of IAI requiring antibacterial therapy, that patient was considered a treatment failure. Dosage adjustments Patients with mild to moderate renal impairment had their study drug therapy dosage adjusted according to the following: Doripenem and meropenem dosage adjustments (DORI-07 and DORI-08) The dosage of amoxicillin/clavulanate was adjusted according to clinical practice in patients with CrCL &lt;30mL/min.

## · Objectives

The primary objective of the both cIAI studies (DORI-07 and DORI-08) was to compare the safety and to demonstrate equivalent clinical efficacy of doripenem to that of meropenem in the treatment of cIAI.  Doripenem  was  to  be  considered  non-inferior  to  meropenem  if  the  lower  margin  of  the  95% confidence  interval  (CI)  for  the  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  was  above  15%  for  the primary endpoint.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Outcomes/endpoints

The-primary  efficacy  endpoints  were  clinical  cure  rate  at  the  test  of  cure  visit  (TOC)  in  the microbiologically evaluable (ME) population at TOC analysis set and c linical cure rate at any time up to  60  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study  drug  therapy  in  the  microbiological  modified  intent-to-treat (mMITT) analysis set.

Secondary endpoints included clinical cure rate at the TOC in the clinical evaluable (CE) analysis set, microbiological  response  per  patient  and  per  pathogen  at  early  follow-up  (EFU)  and  TOC,  clinical response at end of intravenous treatment EOT(IV) and EFU visits and, per blood pathogen microbial outcome.

Clinical response was based on the following criteria: Clinical  Cure :  Resolution  of  signs  or  symptoms  of  the  index  infection,  such  that  no  additional antibacterial therapy or surgical or percutaneous intervention was required Clinical Improvement (only at the EOT(IV) visit): Resolution or significant improvement of signs or symptoms of the index infection. Patients could be switched to oral therapy. Clinical Failure: Patients were classified as a clinical failure based on: ·   Death related to IAI at any time point; ·   Persisting or recurrent infection within the abdomen ·   Post-surgical wound infection, ·   Treatment with additional antibiotics for ongoing symptoms of IAI during the study period. Indeterminate: Study data were not available for evaluation of efficacy for any reason Evaluation for microbiological response Specimens from the site of infection, obtained at study entry and subsequent when clinically indicated, were  cultured  both  aerobically  and  anaerobically.  Microbiological  outcome  was  assessed  both  per patient (microbiological response) and per pathogen (microbiological outcome), defined as: Eradication :  Absence of causative organism from an appropriately obtained specimen at the site of infection. Presumed eradication :  Absence of material to culture in a patient defined as clinical cure. Persistence :  Presence of the original pathogen in cultures of a specimen from the site of infection. Persistence acquiring resistance: Continued presence of the original pathogen that  was susceptible to study drug therapy pre-treatment but resistant to study drug after treatment. Presumed persistence : Absence of material to culture in a patient assessed as a clinical failure. Indeterminate: Entry culture either not obtained or no growth; or assessment not possible because of  protocol  violation;  or  any  other  circumstance  making  it  impossible  to  define  microbiological response. · Sample size DORI-07 : The original total sample size of 346 subjects was based on an evaluability rate of 65%, an expected  cure  rate  of  80%  and  a  power  of  80%.  In  order  to  increase  the  power  to  90%,  this  was amended in August 2005 according to Amendment 2 to a total sample size of 472 patients. DORI-08: The original total sample size of 346 subjects was increased to 472 subjects, for the same reasons as stated for DORI-07. · Randomisation Medicinal product no longer authorised

Eligible  patients  were  randomized  to  doripenem  or  meropenem  (1:1)  by  using  an  interactive  voice response  system  (IVRS).  The  randomization  included  stratification  by  region  (North  America, South  America  and  Europe)  and  within  each  region  according  to  primary  sites  of  infections (complicated localized appendicitis vs. other cIAIs), and APACHE II score ≤ 10 or &gt;10. Patients with generalized peritonitis, regardless of origin, were stratified to the 'other site' infection group.

## · Blinding (masking)

The assignment to doripenem or meropenem was blinded to study personnel (with the exception of the pharmacist/designee), patients, and the Sponsor. The two study drugs required different administration in terms of volume and duration of infusion. To maintain the blind a double-dummy design approach was implemented with normal saline infusions to match the doripenem and meropenem administration.  If  unblinding  of  study  drug  therapy  assignment  was  considered  necessary,  the investigator contacted the appropriate regional medical/pharmacovigilance officer to discuss the need for unblinding.

Sensitivity  analyses  of  the  primary  and  co-primary  endpoints  were  conducted  by  adjusting  for  the effects of the site of infection (complicated localized appendicitis vs diagnosis of other sites of IAI) and  the  severity  of  illness  (APACHE  II  score ≤ 10  or  &gt;10)  using  a  continuity-adjusted  CMH-type method weighted by the sample sizes.

· Statistical methods Data  were  analysed  individually  for  the  two  studies  and  for  pooled  data  in  accordance  with  a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which was finalized before the data were unblinded (one amendment implemented in February 2006). In order to allow inclusion of patients who were otherwise evaluable but had TOC or EFU visits outside the original protocol-defined windows, the  windows for the EFU and TOC  visits were expanded from 7 to 14 days and  28 to 42 days, to 6 to 20 days and 21 to 60 days, respectively. The primary efficacy analysis was to test the hypothesis that doripenem was noninferior  to  meropenem  in  the  treatment  of  cIAIs.  Non-inferiority  was  to  be  concluded  if  the  lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference (doripenem minus meropenem in the proportion of patients classified as clinical cures at TOC) was greater than or equal to -15%. This CI was obtained using the continuity-adjusted normal approximation to the difference between 2 binomial proportions (Wald method). Efficacy analyses were performed using the following study populations (DORI-07 and DORI-08): Intent-to-Treat (ITT): All randomized patients who received any dose of study drug therapy. Clinical Modified Intent-to-Treat (cMITT) :  All randomized patients who received any amount of study drug therapy and met the minimal disease definition of IAI. Microbiological Modified Intent-to-Treat (mMITT): A subset of the cMITT analysis set consisting of patients in the cMITT analysis set who had a baseline bacterial pathogen identified, regardless of susceptibility to study drug therapies. Clinically  Evaluable  at  Test-of-cure  (CE  at  TOC): A  subset  of  the  cMITT  analysis  set  and consisted of all randomized patients who received an adequate course of study drug therapy, who met the protocol-specified disease definition of cIAI, and for whom sufficient information was available to determine the patient's clinical outcome at the TOC visit. Microbiologically  Evaluable  at  Test-of-cure  (ME  at  TOC): The  ME at TOC analysis  set  was  a subset of the CE at TOC analysis set presenting with at least 1 adequate baseline bacterial pathogen, susceptible to both IV study drug therapies. This analysis set was used in the primary analysis. 'Expanded'  ME  at  TOC  analysis  set: Pathogens  form  CE  patients  for  whom  not  all  baseline pathogens were susceptible to study drug therapy. These were included for evaluating per-pathogen microbiological outcomes by MIC. Clinically Evaluable at Early Follow-up (CE at EFU): Similar to the CE at TOC analysis set, but an outcome assessment (other than 'indeterminate') was required at the EFU, but not necessarily at TOC visit. Microbiologically Evaluable at Early Follow-up (ME at EFU): A subset of the CE at EFU analysis set, but with at least one baseline pathogen, susceptible to both i.v. study drug therapies. Two populations, ME at TOC and mMITT at TOC, were used as primary analysis sets. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Results

## · Participant flow

Overall, 87% of the subjects completed the studies per protocol through to the 'late follow-up visit' in both studies. Reasons for discontinuation were relatively similar in both studies and between treatment arms. Of those subjects who did not complete the studies, the most common reason for discontinuation in Study DORI-07 was loss to follow-up (3%) and in Study DORI-08 the most common reason for discontinuation was adverse event(s) (3%).

## · Recruitment

The  original  protocol-defined  windows  at  TOC  (28  to  42  days)  and  EFU  (7  to  14  days)  after administration of the last dose of study drug were later expanded to 21 to 60 days, and 6 to 20 days after administration of the last dose, respectively. Study design of DORI-07 and DORI-08 (final visit windows). The percentages of patients excluded from the ME at TOC analysis set and reasons for exclusion were similar between doripenem and meropenem treated patients in both studies and between studies. The main reason for exclusion from the ME at TOC analysis set in both studies were no IAI culture result at baseline (20%) and absence of a valid TOC visit (9%). · Conduct of the studies DORI-07 and DORI-08: The original study protocol was dated 04 December 2003. Three amendments were made. Amendment 1 (September 2004) included addition of study centers in South America and Europe  as  well  as  several  clarifications  in  the  protocol  regarding  assessment  of  failure  subjects, patients with negative cultures, inclusion and exclusion criteria, dose adjustments for renal impairment and monitoring of severe adverse events. Amendment 2 (August 2005) was implemented to improve the power of the study from 80% to 90% by increasing the sample size. Amendment 3 (October 2005) addressed the addition of a J&amp;JPRD clinical monitor and added a procedure for reporting pregnancies. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## · Baseline data

Baseline demographic characteristics were generally well distributed between the treatment groups and between the two studies.

Baseline disease characteristics did not differ significant between treatment arms. More than 90% of the patients overall had APACHE II scores &lt;10 and the appendix was the source of infection in over 60% of the subjects. Of these subjects, 50% had generalized peritonitis at baseline and were stratified to the 'other sites of IAI' group, regardless of the origin of their infection (i.e., even if the infection originated from the appendix).

Overall, approximately 74% (DORI-07) and 80% (DORI-08) of all patients in the ITT and CE at TOC analysis  sets  received  at  least  1  prior  antibacterial  medication.  Nevertheless,  these  patients  were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

regarded as evaluable because the prior antibacterial therapy was given for less than 24 hours or, if administered  for  more  than  24  hours,  failure  of  the  prior  antibacterial  therapy  (as  evident  by  the isolation of a pathogen at baseline) was documented. The two treatment arms were generally similar in terms  of  the  types  of  prior  antibiotic  medications.  Overall,  the  most  common  specific  prior antibacterial  medications  received  by  at  least  10%  of  patients  in  the  ITT  analysis  set  included metronidazole, gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefazolin, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin.

Approximately 25% of ITT subjects and 14% in the CE at TOC analysis set received at least one concomitant  antibacterial  drug.  Concomitant  antibacterial  therapy  given  for  treatment  of  clinical failure did not disqualify patients from the CE at TOC analysis set as described in the SAP. The most common  concomitant  antibacterial  agents  received  by  patients in the ITT  analysis set  were metronidazole, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam.  Vancomycin treatment was permitted as concomitant medication if enterococci or MRSA was verified or suspected. The distribution of baseline intra-abdominal pathogens overall was similar between the treatment arms and also between the two studies and are therefore discussed as pooled data from DORI-07 and DORI08. The most common pathogens isolated in both the doripenem and meropenem arms included E. coli (250 and 226, respectively), B. fragilis (77 and 81), P. aeruginosa (46 and 35), B. thetaiotaomicron (43 and 41), S. intermedius (43 and 37), K. pneumoniae (41 and 27), E. faecalis (33 and 26), B. caccae (30 and 21), and B. uniformis (23 and 22). Other less common pathogens that were isolated in ≥ 10 subjects in either the doripenem or meropenem arm included S. aureus , S. constellatus , E. avium , E. faecium,  S.  agalactiae , C.  perfringens , S.  anginosis, E.  lentum,  P.  micros,  C.  freundii , E.  cloacae , K.oxytoca , P. mirabilis , B. distasonis , and B. vulgatus . Baseline  resistance  to  doripenem  or  meropenem  was  rare  among  gram-negative  organisms,  being observed  with  doripenem  for P.  aeruginosa (1/44), B.  fragilis (1/71),  and P.  bivia (1/4)  and  with meropenem for A. baumannii (1/3), S. maltophilia (1/1), B. fragilis (2/72). Overall (i.e. irrespective of treatment group) baseline susceptibility to doripenem and meropenem was 100% for most of the major causative  pathogens  of  cIAI  including  Enterobacteriaceae, B.  thetaiotaomicron , S. intermedius , K. pneumoniae , B. caccae and B. uniformis .  Susceptibility  to  doripenem and meropenem for B.fragilis was 98% and 99%, and for P. aeruginosa it was 99% and 97%, respectively. Among the enterococci, none  of  the E.  faecalis isolates  were  resistant  to  doripenem  (10%  classified  as  intermediate susceptible), whereas 45% of E. faecium isolates were resistant. Meropenem susceptibility criteria for enterococci are not defined. · Outcomes and estimation Clinical and microbiological cure rates for primary and selected secondary endpoints in each study and pooled data Study DORI-07 Primary endpoints Clinical cure Microbiologically evaluable at TOC Microbiological MITT (within 60 days) Secondary endpoints Clinical cure Medicinal product no longer authorised

N= number of subjects in each analysis set. n= number of subjects who were cured (clinically or microbiologically) Clinical response rates (improvement) at the EOT (i.v.) visit in the ME and CE at TOC populations were 92-95% in both studies and in both treatment arms, indicating a high efficacy of the i.v. treatment regimen. Surgical review panel The  blinded  Surgical  Review  Panel  (SRP)  reviewed  approximately  12%  of  randomized  subjects, primarily subjects deemed as clinical failures, and clinically cured who underwent a second surgical procedure. In general, the SRP agreed with the prior assessment of the patients. In Study DORI-07, 4 subjects (2 from each treatment arm) were changed from evaluable to non-evaluable, and one of these subjects  (in  the  doripenem  treatment  arm)  underwent  a  second  procedure.  In  addition,  the  clinical response of one evaluable subject (in the meropenem treatment arm) was changed from clinical cure to failure. In Study DORI-08, two subjects (one from each treatment arm) were changed from evaluable to non-evaluable for efficacy. In addition, the clinical response of 9 evaluable subjects (5 and 4 in the doripenem and meropenem treatment arms, respectively) was changed from clinical cure to failure. Clinical  cure/improvement  rates  at  EOT(IV)  in  the  ME  at  TOC  analysis  set  were  94%  in  both treatment arms in DORI-07 and  93% vs. 92% in the doripenem and meropenem arms in DORI-08, respectively, indicating efficacy of the i.v. portion of the treatment regimen. The clinical cure rates in each of the subgroups (pooled data for studiesDORI-07 and DORI-08) were generally  comparable  between  treatment  arms.  High-risk  patients  e.g.,  patients ≥ 65  years,  patients with impaired renal function, patients with APACHE II scores &gt;10, and those with abscesses, colon perforation  and  post-operative  infections  as  well  as  female  gender  generally  had  poorer  clinical outcomes.

In general, populations included in the two studies were similar but different regarding the severity of disease. DORI-09 included non-ventilated patients and ventilated patients with early-onset NP, while DORI-10 included patients with late-onset VAP. Inclusion and exclusion criteria stated below were identical for the two studies unless specifically indicated.

N= number of subjects in each analysis set. n= number of subjects who had a favourable outcome (clinically or microbiologically). Microbiological failures The ratio  of  microorganisms  most  commonly  isolated  from  treatment  failures  in  doripenem  treated patients,  in  relation  to  the  baseline  distribution  were E.coli (19%/24%), B.  fragilis (8%/7%), P. aeruginosa (4%/4%), S. intermedius (4%4%) and B. thetaiotaomicron (4%/4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%/3%), E. faecalis (4%/3%) and B. caccae (1%/3%). Similar findings were recorded for meropenem treated patients. Failure could not be predicted from baseline susceptibility data. Emerging infections Superinfections,  occurring  during  therapy,  were  rare  in  both  studies  (3  subjects  in  the  pooled doripenem arms and 7 subjects in the pooled meropenem arms).  Also new infections, occurring after end of study therapy, were uncommon, being reported for 7 subjects in the pooled doripenem arm and in  11  subjects  in  the  pooled  meropenem  arms.  One  doripenem  treated  patient  had  a  superinfection caused  by  a  resistant  organism  ( S.  aureus )  and  one  patient  in  the  meropenem  arms  had  a superinfection with a resistant strain ( Acinetobacter baumanii ). Of the organisms that persisted in any of the studies, one doripenem-treated subject had an isolate of P. aeruginosa with a 4-fold increase in MIC during the course of study drug treatment. Nosocomial pneumonia (NP) Study DORI-09 -  Study DORI-10 The clinical development program, aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of doripenem in the treatment of NP in adults includes two phase 3 comparative, open-label multicenter studies, comparing doripenem to piperacillin/tazobactam (DORI-09) and imipenem (DORI-10), respectively.

All  subjects  who  met  the  clinical  and  radiographic  criteria  for  VAP  had  to  provide  an  acceptable specimen of lower respiratory tract (LRT) secretions. Exclusion  criteria  included  patients  to  have  NP  caused  by  pathogen(s)  resistant  to  meropenem  or piperacillin/tazobactam,  APACHE  II  score  &lt;  8  and  &gt;  25  ( DORI-09 )  or  &lt;  8  and  &gt;  29  ( DORI-10 ), considered unlikely to survive the study period, presence of cavitary lung disease, primary lung cancer or another malignancy metastatic to the lungs, Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), cystic fibrosis,  or  known  or  suspected Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Legionella or  active  tuberculosis, use of systemic antibiotic therapy for 24 or more hours within 72 ( DORI-09 ) or 48 ( DORI-10 ) hours prior  to  start  of  study  drug  therapy,  the  need  for  concomitant  systemic  antimicrobial  agents, requirement for peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis or hemofiltration, immunocompromising illness or immunosuppressive therapy, clinical laboratory abnormalities, history of moderate or severe hypersensitivity  reactions  to  beta-lactam  antibiotics,  women  who  were  pregnant,  nursing,  or  if  of childbearing potential not using accepted methods of birth control. For  study  DORI-09 subjects  with  mechanical  ventilation  for ≥ 5  days  and  presence  of  known bronchial obstruction or a history of postobstructive pneumonia were excluded. For study DORI-09 subjects having the need for Xigris® (drotrecogin alpha) and subjects with an order of \"no cardiopulmonary resuscitation\" in case of cardiac arrest were excluded. Patients  were  defined  as  having  completed  the  study  if  they  had  received  7-14  days  of  study  drug therapy  (80-120%  of  postulated  doses  acceptable)  and  had  attended  the  TOC  and  LFU  visists  as specified in the protocol. · Treatments In  study  DORI-09 Doripenem was  administered  as  500  mg  infused  q8h  as  a 1-hour infusion. Piperacilin/tazobactam (pip/taz) was given 4.5 g i.v. infused q6h over 30 min. Subjects could be switched to oral therapy (levofloxacin 750 mg daily) after at least 72 hours of IV study drug therapy. The duration of study drug therapy (i.v. alone or i.v. plus oral) was 7-14 days. Study drug was discontinued during this window (unless clinical failure had occurred sooner) at the discretion of the investigator if the subject had shown signs of improvement  such as: decreased WBC counts  and  body  temperature  (as  specified  in  the  protocol);  improvement  of  pulmonary  signs  and symptoms manifested at study entry; improvement or lack of progression of findings on chest X-ray; or for subjects with VAP, treatment should have been continued for at least two days after the CPIS has decreased by ≥ 2 points. In study DORI-10 Doripenem was administered 500 mg infused q8h as a 4-hour infusion. Imipenem was given 500mg q6h over 30 min or 1000mg q8h over 60 min. The duration of study drug therapy (i.v. alone) was 7-14 days. Study drug was discontinued during this window at the discretion of the investigator. Study therapy was to be continued for at least 2 days beyond the first day the CPIS score decreased by at least 2 points from baseline (Screening Visit) or until extubated, with a minimum treatment duration of 7 days and a maximum treatment duration of 14 days.

studies.Levofloxacin and other permitted antimicrobials were adjusted according to national recommendations and clinical practice.

## · Objectives

The  primary  objective  of  both  studies  (DORI-09  and  DORI-10)  was  to  compare  the  safety  and  to demonstrate  equivalent  clinical  efficacy  of  doripenem  to  that  of  established  comparative  therapies (pip/taz  or  imipenem)  in  the  treatment  of  nosocomial  pneumonia,  including  non-ventilated  patients and  ventilated  patients  with  early  and  late  onset  nosocomial  pneumonia.  Secondary  objectives included microbiological outcome per patient and per pathogen and to compare emergence of study drug-resistant pathogens between treatment arms.

· Outcomes/endpoints In  study DORI-09 clinical  outcome  was  determined by  an  external  independent  blinded  evaluation committee  (BEC)  consisting  of  10  authoritative  physicians  experienced  in  the  diagnosis  and management of NP. The primary endpoints included clinical cure rate at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit in the co-primary efficacy analysis sets, i.e. clinical evaluable population (CE) at TOC analysis set and in the clinically modified intention to treat (cMITT) analysis sets. Key  secondary  endpoints  included,  clinical  cure  rate/improvement  in  CE  population  at  end  of  i.v. therapy  (EOT(i.v.),  clinical  relapse  rate  at  LFU,  clinical  cure  rate  at  TOC  in  the  ME  and  mMITT analysis sets, clinical cure rate in the VAP-subset At EOT(i.v.), TOC and LFU and microbiological cure rate at TOC and LFU visits per patient and per pathogen. In  study DORI-10 primary  endpoints  were  clinical  response  rate  at  TOC  visit  in  the  co-primary efficacy analysis sets, i.e. the CE at TOC analysis set and in the cMITT analysis sets. Key secondary endpoints included clinical cure rate at the TOC visit in the ME and mMITT analysis set, clinical relapse rate at LFU, microbiological cure rate at TOC and LFU visits per patient and per pathogen, the proportion of subjects with decrease of susceptibility to study drug received in strains of P. aeruginosa isolates that were isolated from post-baseline LRT culture specimens, compared with the baseline strain, (analysed in the mMITT analysis set). The clinical response was determined at the end of i.v. treatment (EOT (i.v.), TOC and LFU visits. Clinical evaluations were based on Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CIPS) (points 0-5) in subjects with VAP, clinical examination of the chest, ventilator needs, chest radiographs, oxygenation status and oral temperature. In DORI-09 the final clinical outcome at TOC in all subjects who had received at least 48 hours of study  therapy  was  determined  by  an  external  independent  blinded  evaluation  committee  (BEC).  In DORI-10 was the assessment performed by the investigator. Clinical response was based on the following criteria: Clinical Cure Resolution of signs and symptoms of NP and improvement or lack of progression of all  chest  x-ray  abnormalities,  such  that  no  additional  antibacterial  therapy  was  required  for  the treatment of the current infection. Clinical Improvement (DORI-09 only) : Resolution or improvement in the signs and symptoms of NP. Subjects could be switched to oral study drug therapy (only valid for the EOT(i.v.) visit). Clinical Failure: Subjects were classified as a clinical failure after at least 48 hours of study drug therapy based on: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Death due to NP
- Persistence, incomplete resolution or worsening in signs or symptoms of the acute process;
- Development of new signs or symptoms of pulmonary infection requiring antimicrobial therapy other than or in addition to study drug therapy;
- Progression of radiographic findings.

Relapse: Recurrence of signs or symptoms of NP or new radiographic evidence of NP in a subject assessed as cured at the TOC visit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Indeterminate: Study data were not available for evaluation of efficacy for any reason, including: treatment change (other than allowed adjunctive therapy) in the first 48 hours; death at any time prior to the TOC assessment and the index infection was clearly non-contributory. Subjects with a clinical  response  of  indeterminate  were  excluded  from  the  per-protocol  analysis  of  clinical response.

## Evaluation of microbiological response

Sputum  specimens  for  microbiological  analyses  in  non-intubated  subjects  were  obtained  by  deep expectoration or by some form of tracheal aspiration. For intubated subjects, the LRT specimen was obtained by endotracheal aspiration or, if bronchoscopy was scheduled for clinical reasons, a specimen was obtained during the procedure, either by BAL or protected-specimen brush.

•

For both studies s ubjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to either doripenem i.v. or comparator based on a computer-generated randomization code, using an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). The  randomization  block  size  was  4  subjects.  Prior  to  randomization,  subjects  were  stratified according to geographic region, ventilation mode and severity of illness.

Blood cultures were obtained at baseline and were repeated at any time during the study in subjects with signs of sepsis or who were assessed as clinical failures. Identification  and  susceptibility  testing  were  initially  performed  in  local  laboratories,  and  later confirmed by the central  laboratory.  Genotyping  of baseline  and  post  baseline  pathogen  pairs  from clinical failures was performed in the central laboratory. Microbiological response was based on the following criteria: Eradication: Absence of original baseline pathogen from sputum (or other LRT specimen) culture. Presumed eradication: No source specimen to culture and subject assessed as clinical cure. Persistence : Continued presence of the original baseline pathogen Presumed persistence : No source specimen to culture in a subject who was judged to be a clinical failure. Recurrence : Isolation of the original baseline pathogen from a culture LRT specimen taken after the TOC, and the TOC culture was negative or presumed eradicated. Indeterminate: Assessment was not possible Emergent  pathogens  did  not  affect  the  per-subject  microbiological  response.  It  was  categorized  as either superinfection (during therapy) or as a new infection (after therapy). · Sample size In  study  DORI-09  t he  original  sample  size  of  300  was  increased  to  440  subjects,  according  to Amendment 3.  The expected cure rate of approximately 65% was according to previous studies on pip/taz in patients with NP, and an assumption of that 65% would be clinically evaluable. The sample size calculation was in line with the recently submitted linezolid NP study. In study DORI-10 t he final sample size of 520 subjects (Amendment 2) was based on an expected evaluability rate of 50% and an expected cure rate of 60% in both treatment arms. The latter was in line with previous studies using imipenem in the treatment of NP. For  both  studies,  these  calculated  sample  size  would  yield  a  sample  size  pf  130  CE  subjects  per treatment  arm  and  would  have  approximately  90%  power  to  establish  non-inferiority  to  the comparators.

## · Blinding (masking)

Both DORI-09 and DORI-10 were performed as open studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Statistical methods

Noninferiority  of  doripenem  to  comparator  was  tested  in  the  individual  studies  and  was  concluded when  the  lower  bound  of  the  2-sided  95%  CI  for  the  treatment  difference  (doripenem  minus comparator), in the proportion of subjects who were classified as clinically cured, was not less than 20%. The 2-sided 95% CI was obtained in both studies using normal approximation to the difference between 2 binomial distributions with continuity correction.

The following study populations were defined for efficacy evaluation: Intent-to-Treat (ITT): All randomized patients who received any dose of study drug therapy. Clinical Modified Intent-to-Treat (cMITT) :  All randomized patients who received any amount of study drug therapy and met the minimal disease definition of pneumonia. Microbiological Modified Intent-to-Treat (mMITT): A subset of the cMITT analysis set consisting of patients in the cMITT analysis set who had a baseline bacterial pathogen identified, regardless of susceptibility to study drug therapies. Clinically  Evaluable  at  Test-of-cure  (CE  at  TOC): A  subset  of  the  cMITT  analysis  set  and consisted of all randomized patients who received an adequate course of study drug therapy, who met the protocol-specified disease definition of NP, and for whom sufficient information was available to determine the patient's clinical outcome at the TOC visit. Microbiologically  Evaluable  at  Test-of-cure  (ME  at  TOC): The  ME at TOC analysis  set  was  a subset of the CE at TOC analysis set presenting with at least 1 adequate baseline bacterial pathogen, susceptible to both IV study drug therapies. This analysis set was used in the primary analysis. 'Expanded'  ME  at  TOC  analysis  set: Pathogens  form  CE  patients  for  whom  not  all  baseline pathogens were susceptible to at least 1 study drug therapy. These were included for evaluating perpathogen microbiological outcomes by MIC. Clinically Evaluable at Late Follow-up (CE at LFU): Subset of the CE at TOC subjects who were clinically cured at TOC and evaluable at LFU. Microbiologically Evaluable at Late Follow-up (ME at LFU): A subset of the ME at TOC analysis set, with a favourable microbiological response at TOC and evaluable at LFU VAP Subset (DORI-09): This is the subset of subjects, in any corresponding analysis set, who are diagnosed with early-onset of VAP at baseline. Two populations, ME at TOC and cMITT at TOC were used as primary analysis sets. Results · Participant flow The  original  protocol  defined  windows  at  TOC  (7  to  14  days)  and  LFU  (28  to  35  days)  after  the administration of the last dose of study drug (i.v. or oral) was changed to 6 to 20 days and 21 to 60 days, respectively.

Study design DORI-10 DORI-09: A total of 448 patients were randomized to the study to receive either doripenem (n=225) or  pip/taz  (n=223),  allocated  in  68  centers  in  North-America,  South-America,  Europe  and  Others. Approximately 52% of the subjects were recruited from Europe. DORI-10: A total of 531 patients were randomized to the study to receive either doripenem (n=264) or imipenem (n=267), allocated in 84 centers in North-America, Europe and Others. Approximately 38% of the subjects were recruited from Europe. · Reasons for exclusion and discontinuation Reasons for exclusion of subjects from the analysis set differed somewhat between the studies. A higher percentage of subjects were excluded from the CE at TOC analysis set in DORI-10 than in DORI-09 (53% vs. 43%). Exclusion due to negative tracheal aspirate cultures (in ventilated subjects) were between 8% and 6% in DORI-10 while between 2% and 3% in DORI-09, mainly attributed to that  more  subjects  were  ventilated  in  DORI-10  than  in  DORI-09.  Furthermore,  concomitant antibacterial therapy  violation  was  higher in  DORI-10  (25%  vs.10.5% in  DORI-09),  most probably because  of  more  frequent  concurrent  infections  in  ICU  subjects.  TOC  window  violation  or 'indeterminate' clinical outcome assessment at the TOC visit was 21% in DORI-10 vs. 15% in DORI09. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Approximately 67% of patients in both groups completed to the LFU visit per protocol, there were no major differences between the studies or between the treatment groups. Need for additional antibiotic therapy was more common in DORI-10 (14 vs. 4 subjects).

## · Conduct of the study

The original DORI-09 study protocol was dated 3 March 2004. There were 3 amendments during the study.  Amendment  1  (Nov  2004)  included  among  others  the  institution  of  a  BEC  of  experts  to determine the final clinical outcome. Amendment 2 (Jan 2006) replaced the former ME at TOC with the CE at TOC analysis set as the primary efficacy analysis set. Amendment 3 (April 2006) increased the sample size from 300 to 440 subjects in order to increase the power of the study to 90%.

The original DORI-10 protocol dated 18 March 2004 underwent two amendments. Amendment 1 (Jan 2005) provided several clarifications and modifications, such as clarification of acceptable pre-therapy microbiological specimens. Amendment 2 (May 2006) increased the power of the study to 90% by increasing the number of subjects from appr. 400 to 520 subjects, and replaced the former ME at TOC with the CE at TOC analysis set as the primary efficacy analysis set.

As all subjects were already hospitalized for reasons other than NP when entering the study, almost all were burdened by a significant medical history. Most subjects had clinically significant cardiovascular (&gt;80%) or respiratory (&gt;60%) history.

Baseline resistance was not observed to any treatment for MSSA, H. influenzae , and S. pneumoniae . None of the baseline Enterobacteriaceae tested, regardless of study group, was resistant to doripenem or  imipenem, while 10% were resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam. Most of the resistance to pip/taz among  Enterobacteriaceae  was  due  to K.  pneumoniae ,  for  which  21  of  89  (24%)  isolates  were resistant. In addition, 5 of 50 (10%) E. cloacae isolates tested and 2 of 61 (3%) E. coli isolates tested were  resistant  to  pip/taz.  Baseline  resistance  of P.  aeruginosa to  pip/taz  (19  of  105  [18%])  and imipenem  (15  of  105  [14%])  was  greater  than  it  was  to  doripenem  (4  of  105  [4%]).    Baseline resistance of A. baumannii to pip/taz (18 of 45 [40%]) was greater than it was to doripenem (11 of 45 [24%]) and imipenem (10 of 45, [22%]). All 48 strains of P. aeruginosa isolated in the doripenem group and tested were considered susceptible to study drug received, whereas 11 of 32 (34%) in the pip/taz arm and 3 of 25 (12%) in the imipenem arm were resistant to study drug received.

The  majority,  approximately  80%,  of  the  subjects  had  received  prior  antibacterial  prophylaxis  or therapy within four weeks prior to randomization. This is expected in this seriously ill population. DORI-09: The  vast  majority  (91%)  of  subjects  received  at  least  one  concomitant  antibacterial medication  in the CE at TOC population. Approximately 78% (doripenem arm) and 85% (pip/taz) received protocol defined P.  aeruginosa therapy.  Amikacin for  3 to 5  days  was received  by  38.8% (doripenem)  and  41%  (pip/taz)  of  subjects,  while  amikacin  for  &gt;  5  days  were  received  by approximately  33%.    Vancomycin  for  MRSA  coverage  was  given  to  13%  (doripenem)  and  18% (pip/taz), respectively. DORI-10: At least one concomitant antibacterial medication was received by 81% of subjects in the CE  at  TOC  population,  of  whom  33%  were  considered  as  treatment  failures.  Approximately  22% received  protocol  defined P.  aeruginosa therapy.  Among  subjects  in  the  doripenem  and  imipenem arms, respectively, 3.2% and 8.2% of subjects received amikacin for 3 to 5 days while 4% and 3.3% of subjects received amikacin for longer than 5 days. Approximately 28% received MRSA coverage. Overall, the  most  frequently  isolated  baseline  organisms  were S.  aureus (266) (161 for methicillinsusceptible Staphylococcus aureus [MSSA]), H. influenzae (124), P. aeruginosa (110), K pneumoniae (96), E.  coli (73), Enterobacter  cloacae (58), A.  baumanii (54),  and S.  pneumoniae (50).  Other common (isolated in ≥ 10 subjects) baseline isolates included Serratia marcescens (28), Enterobacter aerogenes (22), Enterococcus  faecalis (22), Proteus  mirabilis (21), Klebsiella  oxytoca (20), S. maltophilia (14),  alpha  haemolytic Streptococcus (12),  and Streptococcus  agalactiae (10).  The distribution of pathogen species was similar between the treatment arms within each study. Although there were some differences in the distribution of pathogens by ventilation mode, in general, the incidence of each pathogen was similar in the 3 ventilation groups. Organisms isolated in the doripenem arm were considered susceptible (S), intermediate (I) or resistant (R) if the doripenem MIC level was ≤ 4 µg/mL, =8 µg/mL or ≥ 16 µg/mL , respectively. Susceptibility for comparators was defined according to CLSI recommendations. Subjects with baseline pathogens of  'intermediate'  susceptibility  and  those  with  of  presence  of  both  'susceptible'  and  'resistant' pathogens were permitted to remain in the studies and could be included in the CE and ME at TOC analysis sets. Only 'resistant' baseline bacterial organisms could not be included in the CE analysis set. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## · Outcomes and estimation

Doripenem was shown to be non-inferior to the comparators in both studies. The BEC assessment in DORI-09, which was the final, was in agreement with the investigators in 98% of the cases.

Clinical and microbiological cure rates for primary and selected secondary end points.

N= number of subjects in each analysis set. n= number of subjects who had a favourable outcome (clinically or microbiologically). Low clinical relapse rates of doripenem and the comparator were recorded, 3% and 4% in DORI-09, and 8% in both arms in DORI-10. In study DORI-10 the median time to CPIS decrease by at least 2 points or extubation was 3 days in both treatment arms. The all cause mortality rate at Day 28 was 10.8% in the doripenem treatment arm and 9.5% in the imipenem treatment arm (95% CI: -4.4%; 7.0%). The  clinical  cure  rates  by  different  subgroups  were  generally  consistent  between  the  study  drugs within each study. Clinical cure by subgroup in the cMITT and ME at TOC analysis sets were similar to those in the CE at  TOC  analysis  set.  Response  rates  in  monomicrobial  infections  were  marginally  higher  than  for polymicrobial infections in both studies. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In study DORI 10 a decrease of susceptibility to study drug among P. aeruginosa cultured from both baseline  and  post-baseline specimens in the mMITT analysis set was observed in 10/28 (36%) and 11/25 (44%) strains in the doripenem and imipenem treatment arms, respectively. Baseline and postbaseline  susceptibility  of  these  strains  are  illustrated  in  the  figure  below.  Most  post-baseline P. aeruginosa strains with increased MICs were genotypically identical or closely related to the baseline strain.  All  11  post-baseline  strains  with  decreased  susceptibility  in  the  imipenem  arm  would  be considered  intermediate  or  resistant  according  to  CLSI  breakpoints,  compared  with  5  of  10  in  the doripenem arm (tentative resistance breakpoint of 16µg/ml). In addition to the emergence of resistance

The eradication rate for P. aeruginosa for patients that did not receive adjunctive anti-pseudomonas therapy were similar to the overall pseudomonas eradication rate in both treatment arms, 79% (11/14) for doripenem and 57% (4/7) with comparator, respectively. In the pip/taz arm of DORI-09, 8 out of 9 subjects with P. aeruginosa infection  and  8 of 10  subjects  with K. pneumoniae infection  with MIC ≥ 128  µg/mL  were  clinical  cures  at  TOC,  implying  the  beneficial  role  of  adjunctive  amikacin administration.  In  DORI-10  was  the  clinical  cure  rate  of P.  aeruginosa infections  higher  for doripenem  (80%)  than  for  imipenem  (43%),  despite  a  higher  use  of  anti-pseudomonal  adjunctive therapy  in  the  imipenem  arm.  Thus  adjunctive  therapy  did  not  seem  to  enhance  the  efficacy  of imipenem. The  majority  of  baseline  LRT  baseline  pathogens  had  very  low  MICs  to  both  doripenem  and comparators, thus no firm conclusions on the predictiveness of high MIC-values can be drawn. In total were 7 of 11 P.aeruginosa isolates with MIC ≥ 1 µg/mL in doripenem treated subjects microbiological cures compared to 5 of 14 isolates from imipenem treated subjects. Six of 11 persistent strains of P. aeruginosa isolated post-baseline in subjects treated with doripenem were found to be of intermediate susceptibility (n=2) (MIC=8 µg/mL) or resistant (n=4) (MIC ≥ 16 µg/mL) to doripenem, whereas all 10 persistent strains of P. aeruginosa isolated post-baseline in subjects treated with imipenem were found to be of intermediate susceptibility (n=1) or resistant (n=9) to imipenem (based on the CLSI breakpoints). In study DORI-09 o ne P. aeruginosa strain in the doripenem arm developed decreased susceptibility, defined as a &gt;4-fold increase in MIC from baseline, and changed from susceptible (S) to intermediate (I). Three isolates in the pip/taz arm developed resistance (R), of which one changed from S to R. In addition, three K. pneumoniae isolates in the pip/taz group changed from S to R.

on therapy, 3 additional P. aeruginosa strains in the imipenem arm were intermediate or resistant to imipenem at baseline. Thus overall, 14/25 (56%) of P. aeruginosa isolates in the imipenem arm were either resistant at baseline or became intermediate or resistant on therapy compared with 5/28 (18%) in the doripenem arm.

The  rates  of  emerging  infections  were  generally  low  in  both  treatment  arms,  5.8%  (27/466)  in  the pooled doripenem group and 8.8% (41/464) in the comparator groups, more frequently occurring in VAP patients. In the doripenem arms were 1.9% (9/466) associated with a non-susceptible pathogen, mainly P. aureginosa , compared to 3.4% (16/464) in the comparator groups.

- Adverse events

In study DORI-09 s uperinfections and new infections occurred in 6 and 1 subject in the doripenem arm, and in 10 and 3 subjects in the pip/taz arm, respectively. Superinfections were most common in VAP subjects. DORI-10. Twenty  (8%)  and  28  (11%)  of  subjects  in  the  doripenem  arm  and  imipenem  arm, respectively,  had  emergent  infections.  Four  and  7  of  these  were  caused  by  study  drug-resistant pathogens,  respectively.    Of  the  7  emergent P.  aeruginosa isolates,  one  superinfection  was  of intermediate susceptibility to doripenem and one superinfection was resistant to imipenem. Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) The applicant provided analyses across studies which have been presented above by indication. Clinical studies in special populations No studies provided in this dossier were conducted in special populations. However, all studies have included elderly subjects and those with renal impairment. The data on these subjects are presented with in each study and commented if needed. No paediatric subjects were enrolled; the lower age limit was 18 years in all studies. Applicant has submitted PIP to PDCO for the review. From  all  studies  patients  with  immunocompromising  illnesses  (e.g.  HIV  infection  and  AIDS, haematological malignancies, patients undergoing BMT) as well those on immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. corticosteroids, chemotherapy) were excluded. The studies excluded also subjects in septic shock or those with very high APACHE scores. The latter varied from study to study. Supportive study(ies) No supportive studies are presented in this dossier. Clinical safety · Patient exposure A total of 3,207 subjects, aged 18 years and older, were included in the pooled safety analysis set. This included 1,292 subjects in the cUTI studies, 946 subjects in the cIAI studies and 969 subjects in the NP studies. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Adverse  reactions  due  to  Doribax  500 mg  every  8 hours  occurred  at  rate  of  32%.  Doribax  was discontinued because of adverse drug reactions in 0.1% of patients overall. Adverse drug reactions that led to Doribax discontinuation were nausea (0.1%), diarrhoea (0.1%), pruritus (0.1%), vulvomycotic infection (0.1%),  hepatic  enzyme  increased  (0.2  %)  and  rash  (0.2%).  The  most  common  adverse reactions were headache (10%), diarrhoea (9%) and nausea (8%).

Rates of the majority of AEs, including those most commonly encountered, seen with doripenem in individual studies were generally similar to those for comparators and the same was seen in the pooled analysis. However, several differences between studies in the frequency and severity of AEs have been observed which are most likely due to the varying severity of the condition under study. The applicant specifically evaluated several AE that are though to be associated with the beta-lactam antibiotics and categorised  them  under  adverse  drug  reactions.  The  following  events  have  been  covered:  possible allergic  reactions  (PAR),  rash,  hypersensitivity  reactions,  seizures, C.difficile colitis  and  candidiasis and vaginitis and their distribution in various studies is presented in the table below.

Total  AEs  mapped  to  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  suggested  no  major  difference  between doripenem and comparators; headache was an exception and was seen more often in patients treated with  doripenem  (especially  in  those  receiving  1-hour  infusions)  than  with  comparator  agents. However,  in  the  phase  1  studies  the  frequency  of  headache  in  subjects  treated  with  placebo  and doripenem was similar. Headache was also more common in women than in men but this might be related to the reporting habits rather than to real gender effect of doripenem.

Percentages calculated using the number of subjects with laboratory values ≤ ULN at baseline and non-missing post-baseline laboratory values. b Includes reactions reported as allergic and bullous dermatitis, erythema, macular/papular eruptions and erythema multiforme Common  side  effects  of  beta-lactam  antibiotics  are  hypersensitivity  reactions  and  skin  rash.  The applicant has conducted a thorough investigation of all AEs that could be categorized under possible allergic reactions and found that their number in doripenem arm was numerically higher than in any of the comparator arms. However, when only events categorized under rash were analysed it appeared that  their  frequency  was  similar  to  other  carbapenems.  Not  surprisingly  it  also  appeared  that  the hypersensitivity reaction were more common in NP studies (sicker patients) than in patients with cUTI infections. In the clinical programme no cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome was reported but there was a case in the post marketing surveillance programme in Japan. Also there have been no cases of anaphylactoid  reactions  in  the  clinical  development  program  but  there  has  been  one  in  the  post marketing surveillance. As expected with a beta-lactam antibiotic the AEs associated with gastrointestinal tract such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation were commonly seen in patients treated with doripenem. However, laboratory  proven C.difficile colitis  was  rare  and  seen  in  less  than  1%  of  patients.  Furthermore  its frequency was not different of that in the comparator arms. In the post marketing surveillance in Japan only two cases of C.difficile have been reported. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Carbapenems as other beta-lactam antibiotics are known to be binding to GABA receptor and thus they all have potential to induce seizures. In preclinical programme doripenem was the least potent of all carbapenems in binding to GABA receptor in vitro and did not induce seizures in dogs and rodents.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Also in phase 2/3 convulsion were seen less frequently in patients treated with doripenem than with other  beta-lactams  except  meropenem.  However,  there  may  have  not  been  sufficient  number  of subjects with underlying CNS disorders, who as demonstrated with imipenem meningitis study, might be especially prone to seizures.

The only AE that was reported at rates &gt;1% higher in the doripenem group than any comparator group was  asymptomatic  bacteriuria  which  seemed  attributed  to  a  lower  rate  of  clinical  failure  in  the doripenem  group.  In  study  DORI-02,  were  23  TEAEs  reported  by  14  subjects  (44%  of  the  study population) with renal impairment. Nine of these (28%) experienced a total of 11 events that were considered  related  to  treatment.  The  remaining  12 TEAEs were classified  as  unrelated  or  unlikely related to treatment.

Death  rates  in  the  Phase  2  and  3  studies  differed  by  severity  of  the  indication  under  study,  being highest in the NP studies. Within each indication/ study the mortality rate for the doripenem group was comparable to that of the respective comparator group. The most frequently reported AE leading to death in the doripenem group, which occurred predominantly in the NP group, were pneumonia and respiratory failure.

In  study  DORI-NOS-1005 there were no severe TEAE or SAEs. One of the 6 subjects with ESRD (end  stage  renal  disease)  who  received  doripenem  prior  to  hemodialysis  experienced  three  AEs compared  with  two  of  6 healthy  subjects  who  experienced  one  AE  each.  None  of  the six ESRD subjects who received doripenem immediately following a hemodialysis session experienced an AE. The AE phlebitis (all causality and treatment related) was more common in patients receiving a 1-hour infusion as compared to those receiving the same dose by a 4-hour infusion and it was also more often seen in doripenem than in any of the comparator arms. Furthermore infusion site reactions such as pain and injection site swelling in phase 1 studies were experienced by more subjects receiving 1 g doses  of  doripenem  than  by  those  receiving  500  mg.  This  all  suggests  that  there  is  an  association between  the  strength  of  doripenem  dose  and/or  infusion  time  and  infusion  site  reaction  and/or phlebitis. The data available suggest that the risk of clinically important QTc prolongation with doripenem is low and no further action is needed. There is no evidence that gender differences are important in doripenem pharmacokinetics neither do they seem to play a role in its safety profile. The gender differences seen in the clinical programme are most likely associated with the reporting habits not to the gender effect of doripenem. The  applicant  has  conducted  a  thorough  analysis  of  TEAE.  In  general  doripenem  is  safe  and  well tolerated by patients with cUTI, cIAI and NP including VAP. · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events The percent of subjects experiencing serious TEAEs were 15.2% in the doripenem group, 4.0% in the levofloxacin group, 16.4% in the meropenem group, 26.2% in the piperacillin/tazobactam group and 27.4% in the imipenem group. Overall, the rates of most serious TEAEs reported in the doripenem group were within the ranges reported for the comparator group. No event occurred at a &gt;2% higher rate in the doripenem group than in all other comparator groups. Serious AEs were generally more common in the cIAI group and NP group, but within each indication a similar overall incidence was observed among the other treatment groups. Twenty  SAEs  pertaining  to  impaired  renal  function  were  reported  as  renal  failure  (5),  acute  renal failure  (13),  or  renal  impairment  (2).    These  events  occurred  in  groups  receiving  doripenem  (15) imipenem   (4)  and  piperacillin/tazobactam  (1),  respectively.  No  subject  in  the  levofloxacin  or meropenem treatment groups experienced of renal failure. Two events in the doripenem group were possibly related to treatment with the study drug.

- Laboratory findings

The applicant has provided a thorough analysis of liver function tests abnormalities showing that with regard  to  the  liver  function,  doripenem  does  not  present  significant  concern.  Individual  and  mean

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

biochemistry  data  indicate  an  apparent  dose  response  trend  for  serum  levels  of  ALT  and  AST  to increase following repeated administration of doripenem. This apparent trend was most pronounced in the high dose cohort. One subject in the doripenem 1g Q8h experienced elevation of transaminases 2.5 times  the  upper  limit  of  normal.  He  also  had  an  elevation  of  bilirubin  of  unknown  etiology  nearly twice the upper limit of normal. This dose-response trend appeared to be reversible.

A total of 11 pregnancies were reported in subjects who received doripenem. Only one ended up with the  birth  of  a  normal  full  term  baby.  Remaining  pregnancies  were  either  miscarried,  completed  in spontaneous  abortion  or  were  terminated.  In  animal  studies  doripenem  had  no  effect  on  postnatal development  or  reproductive  performance  of  offspring  (neither  was  it  teratogenic),  in  the  clinical programme, Furthermore in animal studies only a single dose of doripenem was tested and this is most likely  not  a  reflection  of  clinical  practice  in  where  doripenem  will  be  given  three  times  daily  for several days.  Given the small number of women who were or may have been exposed to doripenem while  pregnant,  a  relationship  between  doripenem  exposure  and  pregnancy  outcome  cannot  be established. The use of doripenem during pregnancy and breastfeeding are very limited and doripenem should not be used in these circumstances. No dosage adjustment  is  required  in  elderly  subjects  with  normal  (age  appropriate)  renal  function. There  were  no  studies  on  pediatric  populations,  nor  have  any  age  limit  for  therapeutic  use  been specified. · Immunological events Allergic  reactions  have  been  associated  with β -lactam  antibiotics,  including  carbapenems.  All  rash TEAEs  from  all  Phase 2  and 3  studies  were  summarized  and  evaluated  as  possible  allergic  rash reactions to study drug: and all TEAEs that coded to the MedDRA terms of anaphylactic responses, and to hypersensitivity reactions were evaluated as possible anaphylactic reactions and hypersensitivity to study drug, respectively. · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions Aminoglycosides  and  vancomycin  were  permitted  in  doripenem  clinical  programme  as  adjunctive therapies. No significant interferences between aminoglycosides and doripenem regarding the safety profile  were  observed.  However,  several  TEAEs  including  those  associated  with  impaired  renal function were observed more frequently in patients treated with the combination of doripenem and vancomycin than in those receiving doripenem monotherapy. Other carbapenem antibiotics are shown to decrease AUC of valproic acid. In experimental studies coadministration of doripenem and valproic acid did not result in the decreased AUC. However, if these agents were given to monkeys a 30% but non-significant decrease in AUC was observed suggesting that  interactions  between  valproic  acid  and  doripenem  might  be  species  dependent.  In  the  clinical programme there was no evidence that combination of doripenem and valproic acid has led to the increased  frequency  of  seizures  but  the  blood  concentrations  of  valproic  acid  were  not  measured. Applicant recommends during treatment with doripenem measuring valproic acid concentrations and this is appropriately reflected in the SPC. · Discontinuation due to adverse events Medicinal product no longer authorised

The primary reason for discontinuation from the study was comparable for the doripenem group and the respective comparator groups.

Of the subjects included in the safety analyses from the pooled phase 2 and 3 studies (excluding the doripenem  250  mg  group  from  DORI-03)  78%  completed  the  study  per-protocol.  Death  was  the primary  reason  for  discontinuation  in  the  doripenem  group  12%,  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group (14%) and the imipenem group (12%).  The rate of discontinuation due to AEs was 2% each for the doripenem  and  meropenem  groups,  and  3%  each  for  the  levofloxacin,  piperacillin/tazobactam,  and imipenem  groups.  Negative  pre-treatment  cultures  (cUTI  studies  DORI-03,  -05  and  -06  only)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

accounted  for  11%  (93/855)  discontinuations  in  the  doripenem  group  and  7%  in  the  levofloxacin group. All other reasons for discontinuations were comparable across the treatment groups with the exception of treatment failures.

The table below shows the rate of discontinuation from the pooled Phase 1 studies in the population with normal renal function treated with doripenem 500 mg and 1 g respectively.

Note: Percentages were calculated with the number of subjects in each group as the denominator. Doripenem total includes all subjects who received at least one dose of doripenem 500 mg or 1 g. Due to crossover designs, the numbers of subjects who received doripenem 500 mg plus doripenem 1 g does not equal doripenem total. · Post marketing experience As  part  of  the  Shionogi  development  program,  17  studies  were  conducted  where  the  safety  of doripenem  was  extensively  evaluated  in  Phase  1,  2  and  3  studies  in  Japanese  subjects.  Over  800 Japanese subjects were exposed to at least one dose of doripenem (ranging from 125 mg twice daily bid to 1g bid). More than 60% of the enrolled subjects with a variety of infections received doripenem 250  mg  bid  and  more  than  50%  received  doripenem  therapy  for  at  least  7  days.  There  were  70 spontaneous reports, all from Japan, comprising 84 events with Finibax (doripenem) as the suspect or a suspect interacting drug. Taken together in these studies doripenem was well tolerated and no safety signals were recorded. 2.5 Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system The  CHMP considered that the  Pharmacovigilance system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of Doribax is adequately established.

The active substance doripenem monohydrate is a synthetic carbapenem antibiotic structurally related to other β -lactam antibiotics.

<!-- image -->

1.817 adult patients received doripenem and were evaluated for safety in phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials. Adverse reactions due to doripenem 500 mg every 8 hours occurred at rate of 32%. doripenem was  discontinued  because  of  adverse  drug  reactions  in  0.1%  of  patients  overall.  Adverse  drug reactions that led to doripenem discontinuation were nausea (0.1%), diarrhoea (0.1%), pruritus (0.1%), vulvomycotic infection (0.1%), hepatic enzyme increased (0.2 %) and rash (0.2%). The most common adverse reactions were headache (10%), diarrhoea (9%) and nausea (8%).

Doripenem  powder  for  solution  for  infusion  is  provided  as  single-use  vials  containing  500  mg (anhydrous basis) of sterile powder. The drug product is manufactured by filling sterilized bulk drug substance powder into clear Type I glass vials with elastomeric stopper. There are no excipients used for this product. Stability tests indicate that the product under ICH guidelines conditions is chemically stable for the proposed  shelf-life.  Furthermore,  in-use  studies  after  reconstitution  in  Sodium  chloride  or  dextrose solution confirm the stability of the product for its administration. Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and the drug product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The result of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these turn in lead to the conclusion that the product would have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the Risk-Benefit  balance of the  product.  The  applicant  gave  a  Letter  of  Undertaking  and  committed  to resolve these as Follow-Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe. Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology Taken together, the submitted non-clinical studies with doripenem are found to have addressed major characteristics  of  the  compound  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  guidelines.  Issues  of  importance related  to  the  particular  nature  of  the  drug  development  program  have  generally  been  sufficiently addressed. Relevant sections of the SPC dealing with non-clinical data are acceptable. Environmental risk assessment of doripenem will be updated with some additional studies. No carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  conducted.  Considering  treatment  duration  and  indications  as well as results from genotoxicity studies such studies are not required. Efficacy The efficacy of doripenem has been demonstrated in phase III active controlled randomized clinical trials to be non-inferior to levofloxacin in complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and non-inferior to  meropenem  in  complicated  intra-abdominal  infections  (cIAI). In patients  with  nosocomial pneumonia  (NP)  doripenem  has  shown  non  inferiority  compared  to  piperacillin/tazobactam  and imipenem respectively. Safety Medicinal product no longer authorised

Serious adverse events such as hypersensitive reactions were uncommon.

Treatment with doripenem seems associated with similar risk for and pattern of drug-related adverse reactions as meropenem.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these

## Risk-benefit assessment

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:  routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information. Benefits Doripenem is a new beta-lactam agent of the carbapenem class. The activity and safety of doripenem resembles  that  of  meropenem,  which  clinical  use  is  well  established.  Doripenem  exerts  a  broad antibacterial  spectrum  including  recognized  'problem  organisms',  such  as  ESBL-producing  gramnegative  bacteria  and Pseudomonas  aeruginosa . Thus  this  agent  has, in line with  the older carbapenems, a potential for empiric treatment of severely ill patients and for patients where treatment with  other  agents  had  failed  or  when  coverage  of  multi-resistant  bacteria  is  warranted  (with  the exception  of  MRSA).  The  Applicant  has  demonstrated  non-inferiority  of  doripenem  in  the  studied populations compared to levofloxacin in cUTIs, compared to meropenem in cIAIs, and compared to piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem in nosocomial pneumonia. Although the efficacy of doripenem in levofloxacin resistant strains was not optimal it might be that carbapenems including doripenem are one of the few options for more seriously ill patients with cUTI, especially for those infected with fluoroquinolone resistant microorganisms. Data also indicate that doripenem might have an improved activity against P. aeruginosa compared to the older carbapenems, which may be considered as clinically relevant. In  the  NP  studies  in  55%  of  the  cases  doripenem  was  used  in  combination  with  aminoglycosides. Although in the post-hoc analysis there were no differences in outcome between those treated with mono-  and  combination  therapy,  the  data  of  using  doripenem  monotherapy  in  NP  are  limited  and monotherapy should used with caution. Risks According  to  international  guidelines,  carbapenems  should  primarily  be  considered  for  high-risk patients, for the treatment of severe infections where alternative agents are proven or suspected to be ineffective.  The  rational  for  these  recommendations  is  to  preserve  the  activity  of  these  important agents, since it has been shown that carbapenem treatment is associated with resistance development, in particular in P. aeruginosa . This finding was also confirmed in the present studies. Unrestricted use of  doripenem  may  lead  to  an  increased  resistance  in  important  target  pathogens  for  which  current treatment alternatives are limited. Prolonged use of carbapenems has been identified as a risk factor for pan-resistant P. aeruginosa , in the ICU setting. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Most  of  the  reported  adverse  events  were  solicited  and  listed  as  ADRs.  However,  anaphylactic reactions,  effects  on  liver  function  tests  other  than  transaminases  should  be  closely  monitored. Furthermore,  seizure  is  a  known  adverse  event  observed  with  the  use  of  imipenem.  Some  cases  of seizures and convulsions have been also reported from the studies with doripenem and these adverse events should similarly be carefully noted and observed. The experience of the dosing regimen 1g q 8 hours is  very  limited,  and doses  higher  than  1g  q8h  (2-fold  the  recommended  dose)  have  not  been studied.  With  the  currently  suggested  dose  regimen  in  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment,  an increased  exposure  of  doripenem  and  M-1  metabolite  as  compared  to  patients  with  normal  renal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

function is expected. Doripenem should therefore be used with caution in severe renal impairment and should not be used in dialysis patients.

The  experience  in  immunosuppressed  patients  is  limited,  since  patients  with  identified  significant immunosuppression were excluded from the Phase 3 studies.  In clinical practice, carbapenems are primarily used in severe infections and when broad-spectrum coverage is warranted. Hence, the target attainment of 35% T &gt; MIC might not be optimal for all patients since it is calculated for bacteriostatic effect,  which  may  not  be  sufficient  in  seriously  ill  patients  with  impaired  immune  defence.  As  a precaution in  this  group  of  seriously  ill  and  often  immunocompromised  patients  a  40-50%  T&gt;MIC corresponding to 4 h infusion time would likely be more suitable.

For patients  with  cUTI  infected  with fluoroquinolone  susceptible  strains  doripenem  may  not  be the best choice as its microbiological efficacy was numerically lower than that of levofloxacin. This was especially valid for emergence of new and super-infections - there was a greater number of emergent infections  at  TOC  window  in  patients  treated  with  doripenem  as  compared  to  those  treated  with levofloxacin. No  formal  dose  finding  studies  have  been  conducted  for  the  dose  selection  of  doripenem  for  the indications cIAI and NP. The currently applied dose is mainly based on PK/PD approaches.  There is an option to prolong the duration of infusion (500mg given over 4 hours) in NP patients in order to cover  less  susceptible  pathogens,  such  as P.  aeruginosa .    PK/PD  data  indicate  that  1g  q8  hours, administered  during  4  hours,  may  further  enhance  the  efficacy  for  pathogens  with  decreased susceptibility, although clinical efficacy and safety data for this regimen is currently lacking. The experience of using Doripenem during pregnancy and breastfeeding is very limited and should occur only if benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Balance Doripenem is a new potent antimicrobial agent and is essentially similar to meropenem in terms of clinical efficacy and safety. The activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ,  an important nosocomial pathogen,  seems  to  be  somewhat  enhanced  for  doripenem  compared  to  older  carbapenems,  which might be of clinical value in specific patients. Taking the demonstrated efficacy and the acceptable safety profile into consideration the overall B/R of Doribax for the indications cUTI, cIAI and NP is considered positive. Recommendation Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Doribax in the treatment of · nosocomial pneumonia , including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), · complicated intra-abdominal infections and · complicated urinary tract infections (UTI) including complicated and uncomplicated pyelonephritis and cases with concurrent bacteremia was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
