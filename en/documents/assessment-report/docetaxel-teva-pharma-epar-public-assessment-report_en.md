## 2.   Scientific discussion

## 2.1.  Introduction

Docetaxel Teva Pharma concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion is a generic medicinal product containing the active substance docetaxel. The reference medicinal product is Taxotere concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion authorised 27 November 1995.

Docetaxel  is  an  antineoplastic  agent  that  acts  by  promoting  the  assembly  of  tubulin  into  stable microtubulues  and  inhibits  their  assembly,  which  leads  to  a  decrease  of  free  tubulin  and  to  cancer death.

-  Taxotere in combination with doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this condition.

The  safety  and  efficacy  profile  of  docetaxel  for  the  treatment  of  breast  cancer,  non-small  cell  lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric adenocarcinoma and head and neck cancer has been demonstrated in several clinical trials, details of which can be found in the EPAR for the reference medicinal product. In addition, there is a long-term post-marketing experience contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this active substance. The indications for Docetaxel Teva Pharma are as follows: Breast cancer  Docetaxel  Teva  Pharma  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have included an anthracycline or an alkylating agent. Non-small cell lung cancer  Docetaxel  Teva  Pharma  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy.  Docetaxel Teva Pharma in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not previously received chemotherapy for this condition. Prostate cancer  Docetaxel  Teva  Pharma in  combination  with  prednisone  or  prednisolone  is  indicated  for  the treatment of patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. The  following  indications  also  approved  for  Taxotere  but  covered  by  patent  usage  are  not  part  of Docetaxel Teva Pharma indications: Breast cancer  Taxotere in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of patients with o operable node- positive breast cancer o operable node-negative breast cancer For  patients  with  operable  node-negative  breast  cancer,  adjuvant  treatment  should  be restricted to patients eligible to receive chemotherapy according to internationally established criteria for primary therapy of early breast cancer. Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  Taxotere  in  combination  with  trastuzumab  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with metastatic  breast  cancer  whose  tumors  overexpress  HER2  and  who  previously  have  not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease.
-  Taxotere in combination with capecitabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Previous therapy should have included an anthracycline.

## Gastric adenocarcinoma

-  Taxotere  in  combination  with  cisplatin  and  5-fluorouracil  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

## Head and neck cancer

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Taxotere  in  combination  with  cisplatin  and  5-fluorouracil  is  indicated  for  the  induction treatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

## 2.2.  Quality aspects

## 2.2.1.  Introduction

Docetaxel Teva Pharma 40 mg/ml, concentrate for solution for infusion is a clear viscous yellow to yellow-brown solution. It is supplied with an additional vial of solvent (water for injection). The solvent is  used to premix the concentrate in order to obtain a sterile solution intended for dilution with 5% glucose or 0.9% sodium chloride prior to intravenous infusion. The excipients used in the formulation are polysorbate 80 and ethanol. The formulation of this product is similar to the reference product Taxotere. The only minor difference is the absence of citric acid. 2.2.2.  Active Substance Docetaxel is an efficient inhibitor of eukaryotic cell replication, blocking cells in the late G2-M phase of the cell cycle. It promotes abnormal assembly of microtubules via stabilization. Docetaxel INN is N-Debenzoyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-10-deacetyltaxol ; C 43 H 53 NO 14  = 807.88. It is  manufactured  by  two  different  manufacturers  and  the  Active  Substance  Master  File  (ASMF) procedure was followed for both manufacturers. Docetaxel  is  a  white  to  off-white  powder,  synthesised  in  the  anhydrous  form.  At  25ºC  docetaxel  is freely  soluble  in  ethanol  and  tetrahydrofuran;  sparingly  soluble  in  acetonitrile;  soluble  in  methanol, acetone and ethyl acetate; insoluble in n-hexane and water. Its partition coefficient (log P) is 4.26. Docetaxel is manufactured from N-Deboc Docetaxel, which is obtained from 10- deacetyl baccatin III, a natural product extracted from yew tree. The stereogenic centres naturally occurring in 10-DAB III are kept through the synthetic processes. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Manufacture

Docetaxel is manufactured in 5 steps including purification of the active substance. The route of synthesis was briefly described in the open part but the details were provided in the restricted part of the ASMF. The process was acceptably described for both manufacturing sites.

The chemical structure was determined by XRD, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, DSC and TGA and is well established. Structural studies to demonstrate the evidence of the chemical structure of docetaxel and to evaluate polymorphism, potential isomerism and solvated forms were preformed. XRD results confirm that the same crystalline form is consistently obtained in the manufacturing process

Impurities are well controlled in the active substance and limits are in line with ICH Q3Aand ICH Q3C guidelines.  Specification The specification is in agreement with the new monograph adopted by the PhEur Commission for docetaxel trihydrate, with relevant modifications regarding the anhydrous state. The specification includes tests for appearance (visual examination), identification (IR, HPLC), assay, purity and related substances (HPLC), residual acetic acid (HPLC), water content (Karl Fisher), residue on ignition, heavy metals, specific rotation, residual solvents (GC) and microbial purity. The analytical methods are essentially the same in both manufacturing sites and are suitable to control the quality of the active substance. The methods have been well described and validated according to ICH Q2 (R1). All batches reported for both manufacturing sites comply with the specification.  Stability Docetaxel is stored in a glass flask as primary container under a nitrogen atmosphere, inside a double polyethylene bag sealed individually with an appropriate tie, inside an aluminium bag. Stability studies have shown that these materials provide adequate protection. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Stability data were performed on 6 batches stored at 40 ± 2o C / 75 ± 5 % RH (accelerated conditions) for 6 months and 9 batches stored at 25 ±2o C / 60 ± 5 % RH (long term conditions) for up to 36 months. Photostability studies have not been performed since it has been established that docetaxel is unstable when exposed to UV light in solution and in solid form.

The parameters tested included appearance, assay, purity and water content. The results provided did not show significant degradation and the batch data are in compliance with the proposed specification.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In accordance with EU GMP guidelines 1 , any confirmed out of specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA.

## 2.2.3.  Medicinal Product

Docetaxel  Teva  Pharma  40  mg/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  is  a  clear  viscous  yellow  to yellow-brown solution available in 0.5 ml and 2 ml single use vials. It is supplied with an additional vial of  solvent  (water  for  injection).  The  solvent  is  available  in  vials  containing  1.5  ml  and  6  ml  of  the solvent  solution.  The  solvent  is  used  to  premix  the  concentrate  in  order  to  obtain  a  sterile, preservative-free solution intended for dilution with 5% glucose or 0.9% sodium chloride solution prior to intravenous infusion.

The container closure system for both the concentrate and the solvent consists of clear glass Type I vials closed with a bromobutyl stopper capped with aluminium seal with a propylene cover. Pharmaceutical Development The  formulation  of  Docetaxel  is  not  identical  to  that  of  the  innovator  product  Taxotere  40  mg/ml concentrate, manufactured by the innovator company Sanofi Aventis. The formulation of this product is not identical to that of the innovator product Taxotere 40 mg/ml, concentrate, because in the case of this  generic,  ethanol  is  removed  from the formulation of solvent and is added to the formulation of Docetaxel concentrate. On the other hand, citric acid is not included in the formulation of Docetaxel concentrate. The active substance is insoluble in water and solubilisation is achieved by adding a surfactant to the formulation, i.e. polysorbate 80. At the levels which occur in the concentrate and in infusion solutions, Polysorbate 80 forms micelles  which solubilise the docetaxel and precipitation of the drug in aqueous solution  does  not  occur.  All  the  excipients  comply  with  their  respective  European  Pharmacepoeia monograph. Satisfactory certificates of analysis have been provided for all excipients. Although the composition of Docetaxel Teva Pharma and Taxotere differ in that fact that citric acid is not present, but considering the micellar nature of the product, it was important to characterise the micelle solution and compare it to the reference product prior to administration, i.e., in the infusion bag. The characterisation of the micelle solution included the determination of the pH, micelle size and micelle size distribution. The results of the studies showed the similarity of both products with regards to  micellar  characteristics.  Considering  these  comparable in  vitro results  and  the  similarity  of  this generic formulation to the formulation of the reference product, it was considered that taken together, these findings could be used to support a biowaiver for this 'complex' injectable. Adventitious agents None of the excipients used in the formulation of docetaxel concentrate for solution for infusion are of animal origin. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Manufacture of the Product

The manufacturing process for Docetaxel Teva Pharma comprises four main steps (using a nonstandard process): preparation of the bulk solution, sterile filtration (0.2  m), aseptic filling, followed by closing the vials and packaging. Prior to preparation of the bulk solution, polysorbate 80 is purified and a pH measurement is included as in-process control test to assure the quality of the purified polysorbate 80.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Batch analysis data on three production scale batches confirmed that the defined process reliably produces product which meets the proposed release specification.

The solvent for docetaxel 40 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion is manufactured using a standard process comprising sterile filtration and final sterilization. The process is well defined and controlled. Validation data was provided on two production scale batches.

## Product Specification

The  specifications  for  Docetaxel  40  mg/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  include  tests  for: appearance (visual examination) identification (U-HPLC retention time and UV absorption), assay of docetaxel  (HPLC),  related  substances  (HPLC),  colour  of  solution,  particulate  contamination  (visible particles), clarity, closure integrity, extractable volume, particulate contamination (subvisible particles), pH,  sterility  and  bacterial  endotoxins.  The  analytical  methods  for  assay  of  docetaxel  and  related substances  were  well  described  and  validated.  All  other  methods  are  described  in  the  PhEur  and therefore validation was deemed to be unnecessary.

Batch  results  were  provided  for  four  batches  of  the  finished  product.  The  results  were  to  be  in compliance with the proposed specification. Stability of the Product Three bulk solutions of the proposed Docetaxel concentrate production scale batches (Bulk solutions were manufactured and filled in three batches of 0.72 ml and 2.88 ml presentations). These six batches have been subjected to a stability program which included storage at 5ºC  3ºC, 25ºC  2ºC/60%  5% RH, 30ºC  2ºC/75%  5% RH and 40ºC  2ºC/75%  5% RH. Results up to 9 months at 5ºC  3ºC, 25ºC  2ºC/60%  5% RH and 30ºC  2ºC/75%  5% RH conditions and up to 6 months at 40ºC  2ºC/75%  5% RH conditions were provided. The results obtained comply with the proposed specifications.  Considering the stability data provided and the criteria defined in ICH Q1E, the proposed shelf-life for Docetaxel concentrate is acceptable. The applicant has committed to continue the formal stability studies post approval. In summary, the stability results support the shelflife and storage conditions as defined in the SPC. In accordance with EU GMP guidelines 2 , any confirmed out of specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 2.2.4.  Discussion and conclusion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects The active substance and finished product have been adequately described. The finished product is manufactured using a non-standard process. Sufficient validation data has been provided to assure that the process is robust and well controlled and produces a uniform product. The medicinal product consists of a micellar solution, i.e., the active substance is solubilised in surfactant micelles. The differences between the generic and the reference product in terms of formulation, including the absence of citric acid have been shown not to affect the relevant physico-chemical properties of the product with particular regard to the characteristics of the micellar phase. Therefore, similarity between Docetaxel Teva Pharma and the reference product Taxotere can be accepted and no additional human bioequivalence study was considered necessary in this particular case.

## 2.3.2.  Pharmacology

Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent that belongs to the taxoid class and promotes formation of stable microtubules that are resistant to disassembly. Microtubules are components of eukaryotic cells that play a relevant role in chromosome movement during mitosis, regulation of cell morphology, hormone secretion, transport of granules, anchorage of receptors in the membrane and cellular motility. Cells exposed to taxoids  accumulate  dysfunctional  microtubules  that  can  not  undergo  the  normal  mitotic process and results in cell  death.  Docetaxel  enhances  both,  the  rate  and  the  extent  of  microtubule assembly, inhibiting depolymerization.

Docetaxel  acts  at  the  level  of  tubulin.  Tubulin  is  the  main  component  of  microtubules.  In  normal conditions, there is equilibrium between tubuline and microtubules.

<!-- image -->

In vitro studies Docetaxel is an inhibitor of cell replication in vitro and it has been found to be cytotoxic against both murine and human cell lines. These cytotoxic effects are greater on proliferating rather than quiescent cells.  About  thirteen  human  cell  lines  from  various  tumour  types  have  been  exposed  to  increasing concentrations of docetaxel over 24 h, resulting in a plateau-shaped dose response curve. Increased cell death is therefore more dependent on exposure duration than on concentration. In several human ovarian carcinoma cell lines including lines resistant to cisplatin and carboplatin, docetaxel was 1000 times more cytotoxic than cisplatin and etoposide; and 100 times more than doxorubicin. In vivo studies Docetaxel activity has been studied in different tumour models including murine (Table 1) and human (Table 2) xenografts in nude mice. Table 1.

The  mean  optimal  dose  of  docetaxel  that  produced  body  weight  loss  and  no  delayed  toxicity  was 80 mg/kg. Docetaxel has been found to be active by i.p. and i.v. routes but inactive by oral route. Different  schedules  of  administration  have  been  tested  and  it  was  concluded  that  docetaxel  was schedule-independent for the maximal tolerated dose. In addition dose-response relationship has been shown. Mechanism of resistance The  main  mechanism  of  resistance  to  taxoids  is  due  to  overexpression  of  the  cell  surface  drug transporter glycoprotein GP170 encoded by the multidrug resistance gene (MDR). Docetaxel has been found to be active on some but not all cell lines overexpressing the p-glycoprotein, which is encoded by the multidrug resistant gene. 2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics Non-clinical pharmacokinetics of docetaxel have been investigated in mice, rats and dogs. A study in mice receiving i.v bolus doses of 13-62 mg/kg showed a biphasic plasma concentration-time curve with a short distribution half-life of 7 minutes and an apparent elimination half-life of 1h. The total body clearance was 1.6 l/h/kg and plasma AUC was 17 µgh/ml. Similar data were obtained when doses of 2.5,  10  and  33  mg/kg  were  administered  i.v.  to  female  FVB  mice.  Exposure  of  docetaxel  in  the tumours was very high (AUC range from 17 to 71 µgh/g) due to a  slow tumour elimination half-life, more than 20 h, compared with a plasma elimination half-life of 1.1 to 2-4 h in other tissues such as liver, kidney, spleen or muscle. Half-life in rats was comparable to mice (1.5 l/kg). In beagle dogs, a larger volume of distribution (9 l/kg) was seen. Distribution  studies  with  radiolabelled  docetaxel  have  showed  that  is  rapidly  distributed  in  tissue, especially into liver, bile, intestine and gastric contents. It was also distributed to spleen, myocardium, bone marrow, pancreas and salivary gland. It was detected as well in foetal tissue and milk. Low levels of  docetaxel  were  detected  in  brain;  however  penetration  can  be  increased  by  inhibition  of  pglycoprotein. Medicinal product no longer authorised (s.c.)

In vitro binding to plasma proteins has been found high in mouse (89-95%), rat (70-76%), dog (8389%) and human (90%). In human plasma was mainly bound to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein . In vivo plasma protein binding was also high.

Several studies have shown that hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion are the major elimination pathway of docetaxel in  all  species.  Only  a  minor  fraction  of  the  dose  was  excreted  in  the  form  of unchanged parent drug. Studies in  rat  and  human  liver  microsomes  have  indicated  that  the  CYP3A subfamily is the main responsible for docetaxel biotransformation. Further studies have demonstrated that cytochrome P450 3A4 and 3A5 were the most active for the oxidation of docetaxel to the primary metabolite RPR104952 and for subsequent oxidation of RPR104952 to RPR111059 and RPR 111026. All

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

four of the principal metabolites of docetaxel have greatly reduced cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo .

Faecal  excretion  has  been  shown  to  account  for  more  than  80%  of  the  dose  and  occurred  mainly during the first two days. Recovery of radioactivity after 7 days was &gt;95% in mice, &gt;85% in rats and &gt;90% in dogs. Urinary excretion was low (&lt;10%).

## Drug Interactions

Docetaxel is  a  substrate  of  CYP3A  liver  enzymes,  therefore  its  metabolism may  be  modified  by  the concomitant  administration  of  compounds  which  induce,  inhibit  or  are  metabolised  by  cytochrome P450-3A. In  vitro studies  have  shown  that  ketoconazol,  midazolam,  erythromycin,  testosterone, orphemnadrine and troleandomycin, inhibitors of CYP3A, reduced docetaxel metabolism. No interactions were observed with cisplatin, doxorubicin, vincristine and vinblastine.

Further  studies in  vivo have  shown  that  ritonavir  inhibited  docetaxel  metabolism.  Ranitidine  and diphenhydramine, metabolized by CYP3A, did not alter docetaxel metabolism. Synergistic inhibition of tumour  growth  in  breast  and  colorectal  cancer  has  been  observed  when  docetaxel  was  given  in combination  with  capecitabine.  The  combination  of  sunitinib  and  docetaxel  and  the  combination  of sunitinib, docetaxel and cetuximab showed additive effects. No interaction have been observed when dexamethasone was administered s.c. simultaneously with docetaxel i.v. to mice. Neverthelss, COX-2 inhibitors enhanced the activity of docetaxel in vitro and in vivo in several studies. The  most  toxic  was  the  combination  of  docetaxel  and  cisplatin,  while  the  least  toxic  was  the combination with vinca alkaloids. 2.3.4.  Toxicology Single dose toxicity Results for single-dose toxicity studies are summarised in table 3. Table 3. Single dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs (dose in mg/m 2 ). Studies in mice have shown that the main toxicity effects were seen on haematopoietic parameters, neurotoxicity (doses &gt; 144 mg/m 2 ) and testicular atrophy (doses &gt; 285 mg/m 2 ).

In  rats,  mortality  was  seen  at  doses  &gt;  120  mg/m 2 .  Main  toxic  effects  were  alopecia  and  testicular atrophy (doses &gt; 120 mg/m 2 ) and hematopoietic toxicity (doses &gt; 60 mg/m 2 ). Abnormal mitosis and single cell necrosis was observed 4 days after treatment but disappeared 29 days after. However, in dogs doses of 30 mg/m 2  caused moderate diarrhoea and white blood cell reduction.

In monkeys, single doses of 50 mg/m 2  produced leukopenia and gastrointestinal effects.

The  gastrointestinal  and  hematopoietic  effects  were  reversible,  whereas  testicular  and  neurotoxic effects were partially reversible or irreversible. Overall, these effects are consistent with the toxicities observed with other antimitotic agents.

## Repeat dose toxicity

-  Five-day repeated dose toxicity

Table 4 summarises the results obtained in 5-day repeated toxicity studies in mice and dogs.

Table 4. Results of 5-day sub-acute studies in mice and dogs (dogs in mg/m 2 )

|    | Dog       | Dog             | Mouse     | Mouse           |
|----|-----------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|
|    | Daibydose | Cumulative dose | Dailydose | Cunulative dose |
| LD |           |                 |           |                 |

Docetaxel administered as a daily regimen showed a cumulative toxicity. Docetaxel should therefore preferably be given as an intermittent-dose regimen to allow recovery of haematopoietic effects.  Intermittent-dose toxicity studies Docetaxel was administered at 21 days intervals. Up to 10 (rat and beagle dog) and 12 (cynomolgus monkey) subsequent courses were given. Studies in rats at doses up to 60 mg/m 2  for 3 or 10 treatment courses, showed hematopoietic toxicity, thymic and testicular atrophy.  Studies in dogs at doses up to 30 mg/m 2  for 5 or 10 treatment courses, showed  hematopoietic  and  gastrointestinal  toxicity  and  dermal  effects  (similar  as  the  observed  at single-dose and repeated dose studies). Studies were performed in monkeys at doses of 25 mg/m 2  and 50 mg/m 2 , however the highest dose was  discontinued  due  to  the  severity  of  the  toxicity.  Toxic  effects  found  at  25  mg/m 2   after 12 treatment courses were: moderate neutropenia/ lymphopenia, mild reduction in RBC parameters and moderate gastrointestinal toxicity. In all species haematological parameters recovered during day 21 of the period in between treatment courses.  In  addition,  no  increase  of  severity  or  incidence  of  adverse  effects  was  seen  with  the progression of the study. Genotoxicity Docetaxel has been evaluated for potential genetic toxicity in a battery of standard tests in vitro and in vivo .  Results  of  genotoxicity  have  indicated  that  docetaxel  is  neither  mutagenic  nor  clastogenic, however it increased the incidence of micronucleated, aneuploid and polyploidy cells in  vitro and in vivo .  This effect is consistent with the pharmacological activity of the drug on microtubules and has been reported for other antineoplastic drugs. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Carcinogenicity

No carcinogenicity studies have been submitted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reproduction Toxicity

Fertility studies in male and female rats have shown that docetaxel produced maternal and paternal toxicity  with  a  reduction  in  fertility  parameters.  It  was  considered  to  be  embryotoxic  at  daily  doses &gt; 0.9 mg/m 2

Docetaxel was also studied in pregnant rats and rabbits treated during the organogenesis phase of gestation. It was shown that docetaxel was embryotoxic and foetotoxic, however it was not teratogenic.

## Local Tolerance

Tolerance  studies  in  rabbits  at  doses  3  times  higher  than  administered  to  humans,  including  i.v., intradermal  or  intra-arterial  routes,  have  shown  good  tolerance.  External  and  histopathological evaluation of injection sites in toxicity studies revealed no signs of irritation.

In mice, guinea pigs and rabbits there was no evidence of sensitisation. However, a mild reaction was seen following intradermal re-challenge of docetaxel in pre-treated rabbits. Other toxicity studies Studies on impurities The impurities specified in Doctaxel Teva Pharma, concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion are:  10-DAB  III  (10-Deacetyl  baccatin  III)  and  7-Epidocetaxel,  both  of  them  are  present  in  a concentration in accordance with ICH Q3B(R2) requirements and they do not exceed qualification threshold of 0.2%.  For the other impurity present, 10-Oxodocetaxel, the specification level accepted for Docetaxel Teva Pharma drug product was to NMT 0.4 % at release, and to NMT 2.0 % at end of shelf life. This impurity is within specification limits. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

No  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  was  submitted.  The  introduction  of  Docetaxel  Teva  Pharma manufactured by Teva Pharma B.V.is unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes  for  all  docetaxel  containing  products  and  the  exposure  of  the  environment  to  the  active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased.

## 2.3.6.  Discussion and conclusion on Non-Clinical aspects

The  non-clinical  literature  review  presented  by  the  Applicant  provided  an  adequate  overview  of  the pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological aspects of docetaxel. There were no major issues raised for the approval of Docetaxel Teva Pharma, concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion.

## 2.4.  Clinical Aspects

## 2.4.1.  Introduction

The  applicant  has  provided  an  updated  review  of  the  clinical  use  of  docetaxel  for  the  proposed indications with 95 publications from 1993 to 2008.

There were no detailed study reports from clinical trials submitted by the applicant. The application was submitted in accordance with Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, where the applicant was not required to provide the results of pre-clinical tests and of clinical trials as the medicinal product is a generic  of  a  reference  medicinal  product  which  is  authorised  for  6/10  years  in  a  MS  or  in  the Community.

GCP Not applicable Exemption The  Applicant  has  claimed  that  Docetaxel  Teva  Pharma,  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion,  is  an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance in the same concentration as the reference  product,  and  therefore,  it  is  subject  to  the  exemption  of  bioequivalence  studies  (as  per Section  5.1.6  of  the  guideline  'Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioavailability  and Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98'). Docetaxel Teva Pharma, like the reference product Taxotere, is a micellar solution, and therefore data about the main characteristics of the micellar solution (physico-chemical properties, micelle size and size distribution) in the product ready to use as well as comparison data with the micellar solution from Taxotere were submitted (see Quality section). Results  of  these  studies  confirmed  pharmaceutical  comparability  of  Docetaxel  Teva  Pharma  and  the reference product Taxotere, thus bioequivalence studies were not required. Clinical studies The application contained adequate clinical data from the review of the publication literature submitted for the proposed indications: Breast cancer Docetaxel Teva Pharma monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic  breast  cancer  after  failure  of  cytotoxic  therapy.  Previous  chemotherapy  should  have included an anthracycline or an alkylating agent. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Non-small cell lung cancer

Docetaxel Teva Pharma is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy.

Docetaxel Teva Pharma in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable,  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer,  in  patients  who  have  not previously received chemotherapy for this condition.

## Prostate cancer

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Docetaxel Teva Pharma in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer.

For  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer,  the  recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m 2  in monotherapy.

In chemotherapy naïve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen is docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m² as a single agent.

The  recommended  dose  of  docetaxel  for  prostate  cancer  patients  is  75 mg/m 2 .  Prednisone  or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily is administered continuously.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, determined in 23 patients receiving 20-115 mg/m 2 , are linear, with clearance independent of the administered dose and with plasma AUC increasing in proportion to dose. The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  docetaxel  is  consistent  with  a  three-compartment  model  at  clinically relevant  doses  (60-100  mg/m2).  Half-lives  for  the  ,  and  were  4  minutes,  36  minutes  and 11.2 hours, respectively after a dose of 100 mg/m2 after 1 hour infusion. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel from the peripheral compartment. Following the administration of  a  100  mg/m2  dose  given  as  a  one  to  two  hour  infusion  a  mean  peak  plasma  level  of  2.413.67 μg/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.59-5.93 μg.h/ml. Mean values for steady-state volume  of  distribution  were  67.3-149  l/m 2 .  In  vitro  studies  have  demonstrated  that  docetaxel  is extensively bound to albumin and  -acid glycoprotein and that the latter is the main determinant of variability in docetaxel serum binding. In human plasma docetaxel was found to be bound for more than 98%. It is not known whether docetaxel is distributed into breast milk. Docetaxel  is  primary  metabolized  by  the  cytochrome  P450  (CYP)  3A4  isoenzyme  to  one  major  and three minor largely inactive metabolites (RPR104952 (hydroxydocetaxel) and for subsequent oxidation of  RPR104952  to  RPR111059  and  RPR111026).  The  major  pathway  of  elimination  of  docetaxel  is hepatic metabolism. Docetaxel metabolites are produced by successive oxidation (to alcohol, aldehyde and then acid) of the tert-buty ester group on the side-chain. Based on catalytic potential, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are the most important enzymes among the four members of the CYP3A subfamily (CYP3A4, CYP3A5,  CYP3A7,  CYP3A43)  involved  in  docetaxel  metabolism  and  elimination.  The  metabolites demonstrated  substantially  reduced  cytotoxic  activity  compared  with  the  parent  drug,  making biotransformation  by  CYP3A  a  major  route  of  inactivation.  A  few  small  studies  demonstrated  that variation  in  CYP3A  activity,  as  assessed  by  different  probe  drugs,  is  a  determinant  of  docetaxel clearance. However, so far the clinical usefulness of individualized dose based on CYP3A activity has not been demonstrated by reducing inter-individual variability in docetaxel pharmacokinetics, toxicities or activity. Because of the important role of CYP3A in the metabolism of docetaxel, pharmacokinetic interactions  with  drugs  that  influence  the  activity  of  these  enzymes  or  that  are  metabolized  by  the enzymes are to be expected. The major metabolites of docetaxel and &lt; 10% of the parent drug are excreted primarily in  the  faeces  via  the  biliary  tract,  with  only  a  small  proportion  (&lt;10%)  excreted unchanged  in  the  urine.  In  a  study  in  three  patients  with  cancer,  faecal  and  urinary  excretion accounted for ~75% and 6% of a radiolabelled dose of docetaxel within 7 days. The majority of the dose recovered in the faeces was excreted in the first 48 hours (~ 80% as metabolites and &lt;8% as unchanged  drug).  In  addition  to  CYP3A-mediated  elimination,  docetaxel  is  also  a  substrate  for  the efflux membrane-localised transporter P-glycoprotein, encoded by the gene ABCB1. ABCB1-mediated intestinal secretion has been demonstrated to contribute significantly to faecal elimination of taxane drugs both in mice lacking ABCB1 and in humans.

Renal  excretion  of  unchanged  docetaxel  is  very  low  (&lt;5%  of  the  dose).  The  major  pathway  of elimination of docetaxel is hepatic metabolism followed by biliary excretion. Mean values for total body clearance  was  21  l/h  m 2 .  The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  docetaxel  is  characterized  by  substantial interpatient  variability.  In  a  population  pharmacokinetic  study  of  more  than  600  patients  receiving docetaxel 75-100 mg/m 2 , which used a limited sampling scheme with the last sampling time-point at 24 hours post-infusion, the median clearance was 36 l/h (5th-95th percentile: 17-59 l/h), representing

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

approximately 3.5-fold variation in this population. In a more recent study in which patients received docetaxel  75  mg/m 2   and  an  extended  sampling  scheme  to  8  days  post  infusion  was  utilized, approximately 10-fold variation in drug clearance was observed when patients with outlier values were not excluded from the analysis.
