## Introduction

On 27 August 2020, in accordance with EMA, the MAH submitted A8081013 provisional CSR under Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  it  will  support  the  extension  of  the  indication  in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory ALK-positive systemic ALCL and with ALK-IMT.

A PIP has been agreed for crizotinib with the PDCO in 2019 in the conditions of treatment of ALCL and treatment of IMT.

The  PDCO  agreed  in  PIP  EMEA-001493-PIP03-18  that  the  completion  of  the  measure  for  Study A8081013 is May 2020, the MAH is submitting the present interim CSR under Article 46 within 6 months of the referred date and not within 6 months of the LSLV as it has not yet occurred.

The MAH would like to clarify that the LSLV for Study A8081013 (currently reported as December 2020 in clinicaltrials.gov) is an estimate that is subject to re-evaluation and may be updated later in 2020. It is  difficult  to  determine  the  LSLV  date  for  this  study  because  as  per  study  protocol,  patients  are allowed  to  continue  treatment  with  crizotinib  as  long  as  there  is  evidence  of  clinical  benefit  in  the judgement of the Investigator.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that Study A8081013 / Phase 1b Open Label Study of the Safety and Clinical Activity of Crizotinib (PF-02341066) in Tumors With Genetic Events Involving the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK)  Gene  Locus)  is  part  of  a  clinical  development  program.  The  extension  consisting  of  the  full relevant data package (i.e. containing several studies) is expected to be submitted by June 2021. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed.

## 1.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Crizotinib  was  provided  as  capsules  containing  200  mg  or  250  mg  of  study  medication  and  was packaged in HDPE bottles.

## 1.3. Clinical aspects

## 1.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted an interim report for:

·Phase 1b Open-Label Study of the Safety and Clinical Activity of Crizotinib (PF-02341066) in Tumors with  Genetic  Events  Involving  the  Anaplastic  Lymphoma  Kinase  (ALK)  Gene  Locus  (study  number A8081013).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1.3.2. Clinical study

Study A8081013: a Phase 1b Open Label Study of the Safety and Clinical Activity of Crizotinib (PF02341066)  in  Tumors  with  Genetic  Events  Involving  the  Anaplastic  Lymphoma  Kinase  (ALK)  Gene Locus).

## Description

This study is a non-randomised, open-label, multicentre, single-arm exploratory study evaluating the antitumor activity, safety, and PK of crizotinib.

Initially, patients ( ≥ 16 years) with a histologic or cytologic proven diagnosis of ALCL or other advanced malignancy other than NSCLC, e.g., IMT, for which no standard therapy was available and who were positive  for  harbouring  a  translocation,  inversion,  mutation  or  amplification  event  involving  the  ALK gene locus were enrolled into the study.

Initial reports of clinically meaningful results with crizotinib in patients with relapsed ALCL in the COGSponsored Study ADVL0912 were published in 2011 (Gambacorti-Passerini et al, 2011). Because of the clinical  activity  of  crizotinib  observed  in  Study  ADVL0912,  the  age  range  in  Study  A8081013  was decreased to 15 years of  age  to  allow  additional  paediatric  patients  with  ALK-positive  ALCL  or  IMT outside the US to enroll into this study.

## Methods

## Objective(s)

## Primary objectives was to:

- Assess the safety of oral single agent crizotinib administered to patients with advanced ALK-positive ALCL or other advanced malignancy other than NSCLC known to have an ALK genetic event and Screen for efficacy in this patient population.

## Secondary objectives were to:

-  Correlate  ALK  genetic  events  (translocation,  mutation/amplification)  to efficacy  outcome  measures including PFS and OS,

-  Determine  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  in  this  patient  population using  population  PK  (POPPK)  methods and explore correlations between PK, response and/or safety findings,

- Correlate ALK genetic events (translocation, mutation/amplification) to outcome measures.

## CHMP comment

The lack of a comparator in this single arm study (SAT) makes it difficult to draw any clear conclusion about crizotinib  benefit as compared to other therapeutic options. However, these objectives of this SAT are considered appropriate to assess the antitumor activity and the safe use of crizotinib in the (paediatric) population investigated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study design

This study is an ongoing open-label, non-randomised, multi-center, single-arm exploratory study of an oral  agent,  crizotinib,  in  patients  with  advanced  malignancy  harbouring  a  translocation,  inversion mutation or amplification event involving the ALK gene locus.

## Study population /Sample size

Main eligibility criteria:

- 1- Age ≥ 15 years

2- Histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of ALCL or other advanced malignancy other than NSCLC for whom no standard therapy is available

- 3- Positive for translocation or inversion event involving the ALK gene locus
- 4- Positive for ALK amplification events
- 5- Positive for ALK activating point mutations
- 6- Solid tumours must be measurable per RECIST version 1.1, and lymphomas must be measurable per NCI International Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
- 7- ECOG performance status 0-3

Main ineligibility criteria:

- 1- Mutations of amplifications involving the c-Met gene but not the ALK gene
- 2- Concurrent treatment on another therapeutic clinical trial
- 3- Prior therapy specifically directed against ALK

## Sample size

The  sample  size  for  this  study  was  determined  empirically  based  on  expected  small  numbers  of patients in the population of interest. It was anticipated that a total of approximately 40 patients were to be enrolled in this study.

## Treatments

In the study, patients received crizotinib at a starting dose of 250 mg BID orally continuously.

Dosing interruption and/or intrapatient dose reduction by 1 and if needed, 2 dose level(s) was allowed depending on the type and severity  of  toxicity  encountered  (Dose  Level -1  was 200  mg  BID; Dose Level -2 was 250 mg QD).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Efficacy:

The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR based on RECIST version 1.1 for solid tumors and the NCI International Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for patients with ALCL or other NHL (2007) (Cheson et al. 2007).

## Secondary endpoints were:

- PFS, OS, DR
- Estimated probability of survival at 6-months and 1 year.
- Plasma concentrations of crizotinib,
- Proportion of patients with each of the ALK genetic events (translocation, mutation, amplification).

- Phosphorylation status of ALK in the tumor samples from surgery or biopsy pre- and post-treatment, when available.

## Safety:

The primary safety  endpoint  was  type,  incidence,  severity,  seriousness  and  relationship  to  study medications of adverse events (AE) and any laboratory abnormalities.

## Statistical Methods

## Safety Analysis:

Frequencies of patients experiencing at least one adverse event (AE) will be displayed by body system and preferred term according to MedDRA terminology.

Detailed information collected for each AE will include a description of the event, duration, whether the AE was serious, intensity, relationship to study drug, action taken, and clinical outcome. Severity of the AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.0.

The number and percentage of patients who experienced any serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE, and treatment related SAE will also be summarized. AE data will be presented across cycles and by cycle, as appropriate.  The denominator for each cycle is defined as those patients available at the start of the cycle who received at least 1 dose of crizotinib for that cycle. Emphasis in the analyses will be placed on AEs classified as treatment emergent.

Additional summaries of AEs and other safety data will be presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively, as appropriate.

## Efficacy Analysis:

The study population for all analyses will include patients enrolled in the study who receive at least one dose of  crizotinib.  Data  summaries/listings  will  be  presented  overall  as  well  as  separately  for  ALCL patients and patients with other malignancies (by tumor type, as applicable). Data for patients who are enrolled in the study but are later found to not have an ALK genetic event will be presented separately.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Due to the exploratory nature of this study, no confirmatory inferential analyses are planned, and no imputation  for  missing  data  will  be  done.  Descriptive  statistics  (such  as  means,  medians,  standard deviations  and  ranges  for  continuous  data  and  percentages  for  categorical  data)  will  be  used  to summarize patient characteristics, treatment administration, efficacy, safety, molecular medicine and pharmacokinetic parameters. Data will also be displayed graphically, where appropriate.

## Primary Efficacy Analysis:

The best  response  (CR,  PR,  SD  or  PD)  per  RECIST  version  1.1,  or  the  NCI  International  Response Criteria  for  Non-Hodgkin's  Lymphoma  (2007)  where  applicable,  will  be  summarized.  The  objective response  rate  (ORR)  will  also  be  summarized  along  with  the  corresponding  exact  2-sided  95% confidence interval calculated using a method based on the F distribution.

## Secondary Efficacy Analysis:

Secondary,  time  to  event  endpoints  (eg,  PFS,  OS),  will  be  summarized  descriptively  using  KaplanMeier methods and displayed graphically, where appropriate.

## CHMP comment

As a reminder, crizotinib is currently authorised for the treatment of adult with NSCLC (ALK-positive or ROS1-positive). The present study proposed to include paediatric patients with ALK-positive ALCL or ALK-positive IMT in the authorized population. No change was proposed to the indication statement. Therefore, the assessment of efficacy data from Study A8081013 primarily focuses to ensure that no concerns jeopardize the use of crizotinib for paediatric patients from 15 years of age.

## Overall Population

As of the data cutoff date (03 September 2019), a total of 44 patients (17 in the ALCL group, 9 in the IMT group and 18 in the Other Tumors group) were assigned to receive study treatment. Among these, there were 3 paediatric patients in the ALCL group and 2 in the IMT group.

Ten (58.8%) patients in the ALCL group, 5 (55.6%) patients in the IMT group and 1 (5.6%) patients in Other Tumors group, were still on treatment.

## Paediatric Population

Four paediatric patients were still on treatment (2 in the ALCL group and 2 in the IMT group). One paediatric  patient  in  the  ALCL  group  permanently  discontinued  from  treatment  due  to  global deterioration of health status.

## Pharmacokinetic Results

Due to the limited number of paediatric patients, no PK conclusions could be made.

## Biomarker Results

All paediatric ALCL and IMT patients were positive for ALK-translocation by local testing using IHC and FISH, respectively.

## Safety results

There were no deaths in the paediatric population during the study. The safety profile of crizotinib was generally consistent with the known safety profile of crizotinib, even with long-term treatment; no new safety signals or long-term emerging AEs were identified.

## 1.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The purpose of the A8081013 study, an ongoing MAH-sponsored study of an authorised medicinal product, was to assess the efficacy, safety, and PK of crizotinib in patients whose tumours were found to have a translocation, mutation, or amplification involving the ALK gene locus, in tumour types other than NSCLC.

A PIP has been agreed for crizotinib with the PDCO in 2019 in the conditions of treatment of ALCL and treatment of IMT.

Relapsed  or  refractory  systemic  ALCL  and  unresectable,  recurrent,  or  refractory  IMT  are  both  rare, serious, and life-threatening diseases, and an unmet medical need remains for improved therapies for paediatric patients.

Crizotinib  is  currently  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  adult  with  NSCLC  (ALK-positive  or      ROS1positive).  The  present  study  proposed  to  include  paediatric  patients  with  ALK-positive  ALCL  or  ALKpositive  IMT  in  the  authorized  population.  No  change  was  proposed  to  the  indication  statement. Therefore, the assessment of efficacy data from Study A8081013 primarily focuses to ensure that no concerns jeopardize the use of crizotinib for paediatric patients from 15 years of age.

This study enrolled a total of 5 paediatric patients (3 with relapsed or refractory systemic ALK-positive ALCL and 2 with unresectable, recurrent, or refractory ALK-positive IMT) as of the data cutoff date of 03 September 2019. Paediatric patients represent ~ 11.4% (5/44) of the population enrolled in this study. Given the inclusion criteria, the paediatric population is represented by adolescents.

The study does not allow to draw robust conclusions for efficacy, due to limitations in study design and the limited number of paediatric patients.  However, in the population targeted by this study and in particular  adolescents  with  ALK-positive  ALCL  or  ALK-positive  IMT,  antitumor  activity  was  observed with crizotinib.

No  new  or  unexpected  safety  signals  were  observed  from  the  study  and  the  safety  results  are consistent with prior studies and the established safety profile for crizotinib. Considering that the PIP for crizotinib is not yet completed, no changes in the SmPC were proposed by the MAH.

At this stage no changes in the SmPC are proposed by the CHMP.

## 2. Overall conclusion and recommendation

## Fulfilled:

The Art  46  study  has  been  considered  completed  by  PDCO  through  a  partial  compliance  check  and there  are  no  required  changes  to  the  SmPC.  Considering  that  the  ongoing  assessment  of  variation II/72 will provide more comprehensive data on safety and efficacy, the Art 46 is considered fulfilled.
