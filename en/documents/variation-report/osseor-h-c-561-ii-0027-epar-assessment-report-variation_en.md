Strontium  ranelate,  the  active  substance  of  Protelos/Osseor,  comprises  of  two  atoms  of  stable strontium and one molecule of ranelic acid. Strontium ranelate dissociates at the gastrointestinal level. Strontium is a cation chemically and physiologically closely related to calcium. Ranelic acid is organic, highly polar molecule without pharmacological activity. It is suggested that strontium acts through dual mechanisms  of  inhibition  of  resorption  by  osteoclasts  and  maintenance  or  stimulation  of  bone formation by osteoblasts.

Information on Paediatric requirements Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision EMEA-000733-PIP01-09 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver. 2. Scientific discussion 2.1. Introduction Medicinal product no longer authorised

Protelos/Osseor  was  granted  a  Marketing  Authorisation  (MA)  by  the  European  Commission  on  21 September 2004 for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis to reduce the risk of vertebral and hip fractures. Since the granting of the MA in the EU, strontium ranelate has been approved in 101 countries, and is currently marketed in 81 countries world-wide.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The pharmaceutical form of strontium ranelate is a granule for oral suspension, packaged in sachets containing 2g of drug substance to be taken once daily at bedtime. It is composed of an organic acid (ranelic acid) and of two atoms of stable strontium (active part of the molecule).

The scope of this variation is to extend the indication to include 'Treatment of osteoporosis in men at increased  risk  of  fracture'.  The  application  is  based  on  one  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  study,  one pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study in healthy male volunteers, one population pharmacokinetic study in males, and two nonclinical studies.

## Epidemiology of osteoporosis in men

Osteoporosis  in  men  is  recognised  as  an  epidemiologically  relevant  health  problem.  In  men,  like  in women,  osteoporosis  is  characterized  by  low  bone  mass,  micro-architectural  deterioration  of  bone tissue  with  a  consequent  increase  in  bone  fragility  and  susceptibility  to  fractures.  One  out  of  three osteoporosis-related  fractures  occurs  in  the  male  population.  These  fractures  are  associated  with higher age matched mortality in men than in women. Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) is a major risk factor for osteoporotic fractures in both sexes. Several epidemiological studies, e. g. the EPOS study, have indicated that  the incidence of vertebral fracture as a function of spine BMD is similar in males and females, incident vertebral fractures being more common in middle-aged and elderly women than in men due to the fact that at any age their spine bone density is lower.  Low BMD, increased bone resorption and prevalent vertebral fractures are independent risk factors for increased risk of vertebral fracture in men. Hip BMD is strongly associated with risk of nonvertebral and hip fracture in older men and these associations are at least as strong as in women. Older men and those with lower BMD lose bone more rapidly, offering potential explanation for the increasing risk of fracture with advancing age. In women the World Health Organisations' (WHO) definitions for osteopenia (&lt;-1 SD below the mean for young healthy women) and osteoporosis (&lt;-2.5 SD below this mean) are based on bone mineral density (BMD) data from Caucasian women, and allow to identify postmenopausal women at high risk for  fracture.  Although  there  is  ongoing  debate  regarding  diagnostic  criteria,  WHO  criteria  using  sexspecific  reference  ranges  are  most  commonly  used.  Using  male  cut-off  criteria,  the  estimated prevalence  of  osteoporosis  in  men  aged  over  50  years  is  about  3%  -  6%,  and  38%  -  47%  for osteopenia,  according  to  the  data  of  the  NHANES  III  study.  In  the  MINOS  French  cohort,  the prevalence of osteoporosis in men aged over 50 years varied from 4% to 17%, and from 31% to 48% for osteopenia. Unlike the situation for females, only one third to half of all men with low bone mass and fractures have primary osteoporosis. The prevalence of secondary osteoporosis in men is high, approximately 50% of cases, and approaches 70% in some studies, due to selection bias from specialist centres. The three major causes of secondary osteoporosis are long-term glucocorticoid treatment, hypogonadism and  chronic  alcohol  abuse,  but  other  causes  are  also  important  to  rule  out.  Bone  mass  is  well maintained during life, but following a decline in androgen and oestrogen levels, a decrease in bone mass  occurs.  As  for  women,  the  following  factors  can  also  influence  bone  loss:  smoking,  alcohol consumption, low calcium intake, vitamin D deficiency and inadequate level of physical exercise.

Treatment of osteoporosis in men should be based on the absolute risk of fracture. The bone mineral density  measurement  is  a  most  important  factor  for  decision  about  pharmacological  treatment,  but other factors - such as BMI, prevalent fractures, current smoking and excessive alcohol use - have to be  taken  into  account.  General  preventive  and  lifestyle  measures  including  adequate  calcium  and vitamin D intake are recommended after having ruled out or treated secondary/aggravating causes of osteoporosis.   Pharmacologic therapy for osteoporosis is indicated in men with T-scores below -2.5 or below  -1  with  a  prevalent  fragility  fracture.  The  first  line  treatment  is  an  oral  bisphosphonate,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

alendronate and risedronate being available in this indication. More recently intravenous zoledronate as well as teriparatide have been approved in osteoporotic men at high risk of fractures.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.2.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

Two  non-clinical  pharmacology  studies  were  provided  by  the  applicant  in  support  of  the  male osteoporosis indication. The remaining preclinical safety assessment of strontium ranelate is based on the already approved product for post-menopausal osteoporosis where it also was noted that strontium ranelate did not affect mating performance or fertility in male rats. The efficacy of strontium ranelate in male osteoporosis was assessed by long term in vivo studies in a pharmacological model of osteopenia (orchidectomy). The orchidectomized rat model has been considered  as  an  animal  model  for  androgen  deficiency-induced  bone  loss  in  men.  In  this model, male rats were orchidectomized (ORX) and a 52-week preventive treatment was tested at oral doses ranging from 250 to 900 mg/kg/d. A curative treatment was also tested in male orchidectomized rats  for  44 weeks  at  625  mg/kg/day.  Both  studies  comply with  Good  Laboratory  Practices  (GLP). Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed in both studies using bioanalytical methods with satisfactory precision and accuracy. 2.2.2. Results The results of the preventive treatment in ORX rats have shown that strontium ranelate (250 to 900 mg/kg/d over 52 weeks) prevents orchidectomy-induced trabecular bone loss and altered trabecular microarchitecture induced by orchidectomy, by reducing ORX-induced increase in bone turn-over. This was related to a rebalance of bone turnover in favour of bone formation (sustained increase in total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and transient decrease in deoxypyridinoline (DPD) levels).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment  with  strontium  ranelate  did  not  significantly  prevent  decreases  in  biomechanical strength parameters related to ORX but neither did it adversely affect any bone strength parameters. In line with  this,  strontium  ranelate  induced  no modification  of  the  mineralization  process  as  evaluated  by osteoid  thickness  and mineral  apposition  rate  (MAR).  Strontium  ranelate  had  no  effect  on  the phosphocalcic metabolism. The exposures (AUC24) to strontium were of 367, 542 and 571 mg.h/L in animals treated at 250, 625 or 900 mg/kg/d, respectively. Treatment with strontium ranelate at 250 mg/kg/day  appeared  slightly  less efficacious  than  the  other  doses  and  there  were  generally  no differences noted for the pharmacological endpoints between doses of 625 and 900 mg/kg/day, as a complete prevention of the ORX effects was noted at these dose levels.

The long-term (44 weeks) curative treatment at 625 mg/kg/day restored trabecular bone mass and microarchitecture  in  orchidectomized  rats.  As  in  the preventive  study,  this  was  associated  with  a rebalance of bone  turnover  in favour of bone formation  (sustained increase in total alkaline phosphatase and transient decrease in deoxypyridinoline levels).    Also  in  this  study,  treatment  with strontium  ranelate  did  not  significantly  prevent  decreases  in  biomechanical strength  parameters related to ORX. Strontium ranelate induced no modification of the mineralization process as evaluated by  osteoid  thickness  and  MAR  and  had  no effect  on  the  phosphocalcic  metabolism.  The  strontium exposure  in  those  animals treated  at  625  mg/kg/d  was  609  mg.h/L  (AUC24),  comparable  with  the exposure obtained at the same dose after 52 weeks of preventive treatment.

## Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC)

In  Phase  I  the  PEC  calculation  is  restricted  to  the  aquatic  compartment.  The  following  formula  was used to estimate PEC in surface water (PECSURFACEWATER).

PECSURFACEWATER = [ DOSEai x Fpen ] / [WasteWinhab x Dilution]

Where:

DOSEai

Maximum daily dose consumed per inhabitant [mg/inh/d]

| Symbol             | Value   | Units    |
|--------------------|---------|----------|
| DOSEai             |         | longer   |
| strontium ranelate | 2000    | mg/inh/d |
| Fpen               | 0.01    | --       |
| WasteWinhab        | 200     | L/inh/d  |
| Dilution           | 10      | mg/L no  |

The  substance  strontium  ranelate  is  not  ready  biodegradable  in  the  28  day  modified  Sturm  test (L'Haridon, J., 2004). However, based on the results of the water sediment study (Mégel, 2011) no significant potential of the substance to shift to the sediment phase was identified. The concentration of  the  active  substance  in  the  sediment  was  less  than  10  %  at  any  time  point  after  or  at  14  days. Hence, a potential risk for sediment dwelling organisms (e.g. Chironomus riparius) is considered to be unlikely. Therefore, no Tier B risk assessment for the active substance strontium ranelate is required.

Fpen Percentage of market penetration (default value of 0.01) WasteWinhab Amount of waste water per inhabitant per day [L/inh/d], (default value of 200) Dilution Dilution factor (default of 10) PECSURFACEWATER  Predicted environmental concentration in local surface water [mg/L] Table 2: Input parameter used for the calculation of the PECSURFACEWATER PECSURFACEWATER values were estimated to be 10 µg/L for strontium ranelate. The PECSURFACEWATER for the active  substance  is  in  excess  of  the  permissible  screening  value  of  0.01  µg/L.  Therefore  a  Phase  II Environmental Risk Assessment (Tier A) is triggered for strontium ranelate. Phase II Assessment Tier A - Initial Exposure Assessment Adsorption/Desorption Based on an adsorption/desorption study (Kühne, 2010) a Koc value of &lt; 18 L/kg was determined. The low  K oc value  indicates  that  the  substance  strontium  ranelate  has  a  low  affinity  to  bind  to  organic carbon  in  soil  and  therefore  to  sludge  (trigger  K OC &gt;  10  000  L/kg).  Hence,  an  exposure  to  soil organisms and a potential risk for soil organisms (earthworms) is considered negligible. Biodegradability Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Concentration in soil

Based on an adsorption/desorption study (Kühne, 2010) a KOC value of &lt; 18 L/kg was determined. The low  K OC value  indicates  that  the  substance  strontium  ranelate  has  a  low  affinity  to  bind  to  organic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

carbon in soil and thereby a potential transfer of the substance to the soil compartment is considered low.

## Concentration in surface waters

The  PECSURFACEWATER for  the  intended  use  (2  g  a.s./d)  was  estimated  to  be  10  µg/L  for  strontium ranelate (see Table 2).

b The NOEC is based on effects on survival and reproduction (offspring per surviving female). Potential sub-lethal effects like length and body weight of adult daphnids were not considered. Although these parameters are not mandatory according to the OECD guideline they are recommended to be able to assess potential sub-lethal effects.

The water sediment study shows that the parent substance is not present at amount higher than 10% in the sediment extracts at any time interval throughout the study, thus a Tier B assessment is not necessary. Concentration in groundwater Entry  into  groundwater  is  considered  to  occur  via  bank  filtration,  except  for  substances  with  an average Koc &gt; 10 000 L/kg or for substances that are readily biodegradable or for substances that have a DT90 &lt; 3 days. The substance strontium ranelate is not readily biodegradable and has a Koc of &lt; 18 L/kg.  No  information  is  given  regarding  the  DT90  in  water  or  soil  compartment.  Hence,  the PECGROUNDWATER has to be estimated according to the following formula: PECGROUNDWATER = 0.25 x PECSURFACEWATER The PECGROUNDWATER for strontium ranelate was calculated to be 2.5 µg/L. Bioaccumulation The log POW of the substance strontium ranelate (log POW &lt; -5) is below the trigger of 3. Therefore, the potential risk from bioaccumulation in the aquatic food chain is considered low.

AF…assessment factor, RQ…risk quotient (PEC / PNEC)

a The risk assessment for groundwater organisms is based on aquatic invertebrates (daphnids). The endpoint used for the risk assessment is based on a NOEC 0f 200 mg a.s./L derived from a study by Peither, A., 2010b. In the study sub-lethal effects (length and body weight) on adult daphnids were not considered. However, the RQ value is well below the trigger and it can be assumed that the risk for groundwater organisms is acceptable even under consideration of possible sub-lethal effects.

a The risk assessment for micro-organisms in activated sludge is based on an EC 50 instead of a NOEC. Hence, an assessment factor of 100 is considered for the calculation of the PNEC MICROORGANISM . The calculated RQ-values are well below the trigger values indicating an acceptable risk for aquatic organisms in surface water and groundwater as well as for micro-organisms of activated sludge. In  conclusion,  it  is  considered  that  the  risk  for  aquatic  organisms  from  exposure  to  the  products 'Osseor' and 'Protelos' is acceptable according to the intended use. No precautionary and safety measures for administration, disposal and labelling are required. 2.2.3. Discussion The results from these non-clinical studies show that strontium ranelate has beneficial effects in the orchidectomized  rat  model,  which  is  considered  as  an  appropriate  animal  model  for  androgen deficiency-induced bone loss in men. It preserved or increased bone mass by reducing ORX-induced increases in bone turnover as shown by decreases in biochemical markers of bone turnover. The gains in bone mass and geometry parameters in rats after the treatment with 625 mg/kg/day for 44 weeks after  an 8-week  bone  depletion  period  are  generally comparable  to  animals  with  treatment  started immediately after the orchidectomy. The environmental risk assessment that was conducted in connection with the approval of strontium ranelate  for  treatment  of  post-menopausal  osteoporosis  has  been  updated  in  accordance  with applicable guidelines (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). As the product does not present a safety concern for the environment, specific wording in the product information is not considered necessary. The proposed text for sections 4.1, 4.6, 5.1 and 5.2 in the SmPC is acceptable to the CHMP. 2.3. Clinical Pharmacology aspects 2.3.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted - and Results Introduction Medicinal product no longer authorised

Strontium ranelate contains an organic acid (ranelic acid) and two atoms of stable, non-radioactive, strontium.  The  product  has  a  dual  mechanism  of  action,  simultaneously  preventing  bone  loss  by inhibiting osteoclast resorption and increasing bone formation by inducing osteoblast formation.

The  drug  is  administered  as  granules  for  oral  suspension.  The  approved  posology  is  2  g  daily  at bedtime.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Due to its high polarity, the absorption, distribution and binding to plasma proteins of ranelic acid are low. There is no accumulation of ranelic acid and no evidence of metabolism in animals and humans. Absorbed ranelic acid is rapidly eliminated unchanged via the kidneys.

The absolute bioavailability of strontium is about 25% (range 19-27%) after an oral dose of 2 g and intake  with  calcium  or  food  reduces  the  bioavailability  of  strontium  by  approximately  60-70%. Maximum plasma concentrations  are  reached  3-5  hours  after  a  single  dose  of  2  g.  Steady  state  is reached after 2 weeks of treatment. The effective half-life of strontium is about 60 hours. Strontium excretion occurs via the kidneys and via the gastrointestinal tract. Its plasma clearance is about 12 ml/min (CV 22%) and its renal clearance about 7 ml/min (CV 28%).

Ranelic acid concentrations were determined in plasma and urine by a liquid chromatographic method with tandem mass spectrometry detection. The method was linear from 2.00 to 1000 ng/mL in plasma and from 50.0 to 15000 ng/mL in urine. In study sample analysis, the analytical variability of the QC standards  in  plasma  was  below  11%,  the  accuracy  was  within  100±3%.  In  urine,  the  analytical variability was below 12.0% and the accuracy within 100±3%.

Pharmacokinetic  data  in  male  subjects  has  been  provided  from  2  studies  in  this  application:  The pharmacokinetics (PK) of strontium were assessed after single oral administration of 1g, 2g and 3g of strontium ranelate as sachet(s) of 1g at bedtime in healthy elderly male volunteers in a phase 1 study (pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  strontium  were  assessed  from  Clinical  Study  Reports  NP15696  and NP29996). In the phase 3 pivotal study (CL3-032), strontium exposures were evaluated after repeated oral administration of a sachet of 2g of strontium ranelate at bedtime in osteoporotic male patients, using  a  population  PK  approach  and  the  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  (PK/PD)  relationship  of strontium ranelate and bone mineral density (BMD) were evaluated (Clinical Study Reports NP29822 and NP29946). Phase 1 study (Reports NP15696 and NP29996) Eighteen healthy, Caucasian, male subjects with age ranging from 63 to 73 years (mean of 68.9±2.8 years)  and  with  BMI  between  20.1  and  33.1  kg/m²  (mean  of  26.6±2.9  kg/m²)  were  included  and completed the study. The subjects received three single oral doses (1, 2 or 3 g) of strontium ranelate (1 g sachet formulation) in random order on Days 1, 29 and 57. Blood samples were collected pre-dose up to 672 hours post dose. Urine fractions were collected from pre-dose  to  48  hours  post  dose.  Pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  strontium  and  ranelic  acid  were analysed by a non-compartmental  approach  with background  correction of strontium  plasma concentrations and urine amount. Dose proportionality was assessed by ANOVA and if departure from proportionality was suggested from this analysis, this was further explored using the empirical power method (y=  *dose  ). Strontium  and  calcium  concentrations  were  determined  in  plasma  and  urine  by  Inductively  Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry. The method was linear from 0.0125 to 250 mg/L for strontium measurement, and from 6.25 to 500 mg/L for calcium measurement. In study sample analysis, the analytical  variability  of  the  QC  standards  in  plasma,  was  always  below  3.4%  and  the  accuracy  was between 88.9% and 104%. The analytical variability in urine was always below 6.0% and the accuracy was between 86.7% and 101.8%. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The results are shown in Table 5 and Table 6 below. Strontium exposure (Cmax and AUC) increases slightly less than in proportion to dose and this is also the case for ranelic acid. At the second and third study occasions, plasma concentrations of strontium but not ranelic acid, were measureable in predose samples but at a very low level (in most cases &lt; 0.1 mg/mL).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

According to the applicant, following single oral administration of 2g of strontium ranelate in healthy elderly men, strontium AUC values (median [range]: 394 [290-683] mg.h/L) were comparable to the AUC previously obtained in post-menopausal women (median [range]: 375 [286-521] mg.h/L) when administered in the same conditions (same formulation, same dose, 3h after dinner) [Clinical Study Report NP08405].

Table 6. Ranelic acid pharmacokinetic parameters as mean  SD (median) Population PK analysis A  population  PK  analysis  for  strontium  levels  was  performed  based  on  data  collected  in  the  pivotal Phase 3 study (Protocol CL3-12911-032) by means of non-linear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM version VI). The first-order conditional estimation (FOCE) method with INTERACTION was used. For details on the study design, please see assessment of Clinical efficacy below. Samples were collected in the morning at months 0, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24. For this analysis data up to 12 months was used. Of 174  male  subjects  receiving  strontium  ranelate  treatment,  147  subjects  had  at  least  one  plasma concentration  of  strontium  and  a  total  of  379  concentration-time  points  were  available  for  the population PK analysis. Measured concentrations with uncertainty in timing of sample were excluded from the analysis. Samples below limit of quantification were excluded. Medicinal product no longer authorised

A 1-compartment model with first-order absorption was used as a starting point based on previous knowledge. The absorption constant was fixed to a value obtained in a previous analysis in females. Inter-individual variability was estimated with exponential distribution models. A model with additive and proportional terms was evaluated for the residual error. Potential correlations between empirical Bayesian  PK  parameters  estimates  and  covariates  (age,  body  weight,  body  mass  index  (BMI), phosphoremia,  calciemia,  albuminemia,  creatinine  clearance,  serum  creatinine,  25OH-vitamin  D,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

parathormone  (PTH),  alcohol  and  tobacco  habits,  diuretics,  gastro  enteric  drugs)  were  visually inspected  using  graphical  tools  and  statistical  tests  were  performed.  Shrinkage  of  empirical  Bayes estimates of CL/F was estimated to 11%, thus the graphical exploration is reasonably adequate. The exploration  suggested  the  following  covariates  on  CL/F:  weight,  BMI,  albumin,  serum  creatinine, creatinine  clearance,  phosphoremia,  age,  calcemia,  25OH-vitamin  D  and  PTH  levels.  These  were selected  for  a  formal  evaluation  within  the  population  PK  model  using  a  stepwise  forward  additive inclusion (alpha level of 0.05) and a backward elimination (alpha level of 0.01) approach.

| no   |
|------|

During the first step of the covariate analysis, the effect of calcemia explained a significant portion of the variability of CL/F, with a marked decrease in MOF ( Δ MOF= -13.61, p-value = 0.0002). During the second and third step of the covariate analysis, the effect of creatinine clearance and phosphoremia on CL/F resulted in a statistically significant decrease in MOF as well as a decrease of clearance IIV of 4.2%. No additional covariates were identified during the fourth step of the analysis. Covariates were then  evaluated  using  a  stepwise  backward  elimination  approach  (p-value  &lt;0.01).  No  covariate  was removed from the model during the backward elimination testing. The  final  model  was  a  1-compartment  model  with  first  order  absorption  and  included  the  effect  of calcemia, creatinine clearance and phosphoremia on CL/F. The parameter estimates are shown below together with goodness-of-fit plots. A visual predictive check revealed reasonable predictive properties of trough levels at 3, 6 and 12 months although variability is slightly underestimated. Table 7.

## Population PKPD analysis

Based on study CL3-12911-032 (data at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months) a population PK/PD model was developed to describe the time course of lumbar BMD L2-L4 for strontium ranelate given 2g per day on top of calcium 1000 mg and non-hydroxylated vitamin D 800 IU per day in osteoporotic men. Nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM version VI) employing the first-order conditional estimation (FOCE) method with INTERACTION was used for parameter estimation. The systemic exposure used was  AUC  calculated  using  the  individual  empirical  Bayes  estimates  of  CL  from  the  population  PK analysis. The data set contained 258 patients (87 placebo, 171 treated), 724 observations.

<!-- image -->

The time course of BMD was described with an indirect effect model with one parameter describing bone formation (RFORM) and one parameter reflecting bone resorption (KLOSS). KLOSS was fixed to a value reported  in  the  literature  (0.5%  per  year).  The  model  assumed  the  effect  of  treatment  on  the formation  and  a  baseline  formation  rate  before  treatment  (R FORM0 ),  a  formation  rate  under  calcium, non-hydroxylated  vitamin  D  and  placebo  (RFORMP),  and  a  formation  rate  under  calcium,  nonhydroxylated  vitamin  D  and  active  treatment  (RFORMT)  were  estimated.  The  dependence  of  drug exposure on RFORMT was also implemented in the model. A similar model has previously been developed on data from female patients. The goodness-of-fit plots revealed reasonable fit to the data (not shown here). The baseline formation rate was 50% of that estimated previously in women (might be due to a different fixed KLOSS). The placebo  effect  and  treatment  effect  was  slightly  higher  in  men  compared  with  that  estimated  in females  but  the  placebo  corrected  effects  were  similar.  The  effect  of  systemic  exposure  was statistically significant. Acceptable predictive properties were demonstrated for the model (Figure 4). Simulations based on this model and the previously developed for female patients did not indicate any marked  differences  in  the  effect  (Figure  5).  The  predicted  effect  of  a  one  year  strontium  ranelate treatment  at  the  2g  dose  on  the  increase  in  BMD  was  within  the  same  range  in  both  populations (median [90% confidence interval], was 4.8 [4.6-4.9]% in women and 5.2 [4.1-6.3]% in men).

Figure 5. Comparison of the change from baseline in lumbar BMD L2-L4 in men and women through stochastic simulations 2.3.2. Discussion Phase 1 study (Reports NP15696 and NP29996) Pre-dose samples with measurable levels of strontium are not considered to largely impact the results. The deviation from dose proportionality observed for strontium is in line with that observed in previous studies and has been hypothesised to be due to saturation of an active absorption process. Comparison of the systemic exposure with that of post-menopausal females reveals similar systemic exposure although the terminal half-life estimated in this study appears to be in the upper range of previously reported mean values of half-lives (all studies range 60 to 150 hours). In addition to the study referred to by the applicant, there are two more studies available with the sachet formulation, but  these  studies  were  not  performed  in  post-menopausal  women  (studies  PKH-12911-002,  PKH12911-003). Population PK analysis The report does not completely describe the full details of the analysis. Furthermore, data below the limit of quantification were excluded and there is no description of the number of samples taken. The imprecision in model parameter estimates showed high precision for CL/F (relative standard error 4%) and acceptable precision for all parameters (RSE 20-30%) but V/F (RSE 72%), which may be expected given that only trough data are available. Medicinal product no longer authorised

From the goodness-of-fit plots it appears that low concentrations are over-predicted and the opposite for high concentrations (population predictions) possibly indicating a model misspecification or lack of identification  of  covariate  relationships.  The  visual  predictive  check  on  the  other  hand  shows reasonable  predictive  properties.  Three  covariate  effects  were  identified  and  over  the  observed covariate range, the effect on typical CL/F is in no case more than 2-fold and dose adjustments based on these effects are not necessary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The model is mainly used to describe the data and compare model parameters with those obtained in women. CL/F was estimated with high precision and is in agreement with that previously reported for females.  In  addition,  the  model  is  used  for  generation  of  AUC  values  for  the  PKPD  modeling.  The shrinkage of individual CL/F values were low and AUCs are therefore of good quality.

## Population PKPD analysis

The  model  previously  developed  for  females  was  not  included  in  this  submission  and  cannot  be assessed. However, this information is not considered mandatory for approval and no questions are raised  in  this  regard.  There  is  no  direct  comparison  between  gender  but  based  on  the  presented information  and  provided  that  the  model  for  females  is  predictive,  the  time  course  of  BMD  L2-L4 following the same doses in females and males is in accordance and supports the dose choice in men.

The development program of strontium ranelate in male patients with osteoporosis was based on the European  guideline  CPMP/EWP/552/95  Rev.  Nov  2006.  This  guideline  states  that  once  an  initial marketing authorisation has been granted to a drug for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in  women  at  high  risk  of  fracture,  a  placebo-controlled  study  of  1  year  duration  with  BMD  as  the primary endpoint could be sufficient for being granted a marketing authorization for the treatment of osteoporosis in men at increased risk of fracture, provided that: (i) the dosage used in men is justified, (ii) the included male population is at a similar fracture risk than the postmenopausal women included in the pivotal studies and (iii) the magnitude of the changes in BMD versus placebo is similar to that observed in postmenopausal osteoporotic women treated with the same compound and proportional to the decreased incidence of fractures in treated women.

Conclusion The pharmacokinetic data indicate similar systemic exposure in osteoporotic men and postmenopausal osteoporotic  women  after  administration  of  2  g  strontium  ranelate/day.  Further,  the  effects  of strontium ranelate on bone turnover appear not to be gender-related. Thus, the PK/PD data provided do  not  suggest  any  differences  in  exposure  that  would  necessitate  a  dose  adjustment  in  the  male population compared to postmenopausal females. Overall,  the  pharmacokinetic  documentation  provided  is  considered  sufficient  and  the  proposed amendments to SmPC section 5.2 are acceptable to the CHMP. 2.4. Clinical Efficacy aspects 2.4.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted The initial MAA was based on two placebo-controlled pivotal 5-year studies; the SOTI study and the TROPOS study .  The granting of the initial marketing authorization was based on main analyses from these studies at 3 years of follow-up, that were further completed with data obtained at 4 years, and 5 years (placebo-controlled) and further up to 10 years (open-labelled extension study). The SOTI study aimed to assess the efficacy in reducing vertebral fractures (1649 postmenopausal women with mean age 70 years) and the TROPOS study aimed to assess the efficacy in reducing non-vertebral fractures (5091 postmenopausal women with mean age 77 years). In SOTI, a significant 41% risk reduction of a new vertebral fractures versus placebo was evidenced over 3 years while in the TROPOS study, a 39% (p  &lt;  0.001)  risk  reductions  over  3  years  was  seen,  confirmed  over  5  years  with  24%  (p&lt;0.001) (Clinical Study Report: NP22824). Pivotal study Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study  CL3-032 (the MALEO  study )  was  a  prospective  multicenter  double-blind  placebo  controlled study with a treatment duration of 2 years and the main study analysis after 1 year. 54 centres in 14 countries  included  261  patients  in  the  study,  from  study  start  in  December  2007  to  completion  at Month 12 in March 2010.

## Study participants

Caucasian, ambulatory men of at least 65 years of age and with at least one risk factor of osteoporotic fracture (age &gt; 75 years, prevalent vertebral fracture grade I, previous low trauma fracture, family history of osteoporotic fracture, heavy smoker &gt; 15 cigarettes/day, known low BMD, low body weight) and a  lumbar  spine  L2-L4  BMD ≤ 0.840  g/cm²  (Hologic  apparatus)  or ≤ 0.949  g/cm²  (Lunar apparatus) and/or femoral  neck  BMD ≤ 0.600  g/cm²  (Hologic  apparatus)  or ≤ 0.743  g/cm²  (Lunar apparatus) were included in the study.  Inclusion criteria were chosen to obtain a male population with a  similar  fracture  risk  as  the  postmenopausal  women  included  in  SOTI  and  TROPOS.  A  BMD measurement had to be carried out during the selection visit and evaluation had to be done by the investigator. As incident vertebral fractures are more common in middle-aged and elderly women than in men (because at any age their spine bone density is lower), osteoporosis in average begins 10 years later  in  men  than  in  women.  The  lower  limit  age  was  thus  increased  from  50  years  of  age  in  SOTI study to 65 years of age in this study. Patients  with  BMD T-score below -4.0 at one or more of the measured sites or  &gt; 2  prevalent  mild (Grade 1) and/or moderate (Grade 2) osteoporotic vertebral fractures or severe osteoporotic vertebral fracture  (Grade  3)  were  excluded.  Vertebral  fractures  were  evaluated  using  an  X-ray  of  the  spine carried out during the selection visit. The fracture grading was based on investigator reading. Forbidden  previous  treatments  were  glucocorticoids,  antiepileptics,  and  drugs  interfering  with  bone metabolism.  During the study, patients with the following treatments were to be withdrawn from the study: fluoride salts, bisphosphonates, parathormone, calcitonin, other forms of vitamin D. Antacid use was not allowed within 2 hours from the timepoint of strontium ranelate administration because they decrease the absorption of the treatment. In Amendment No. 2 an item was added to prevent patients from  taking  quinolone  and  tetracycline  together  with  strontium  ranelate  because  strontium  ranelate can decrease the absorption of antibiotics.

Treatments Strontium ranelate (2 g) or placebo was given orally as one sachet daily, in the evening at bedtime. Each  patient  in  both  groups  received  vitamin  D  and  calcium  supplements  (vitamin  D  800  I.U.  and calcium 1000 mg) taken daily at lunchtime, for repletion of potential deficiency. The duration between selection and inclusion (run-in) was 1 to 2 weeks. The duration of treatment period was 2 years (M0 to M24).  The  main  study  analysis  was  done  after  a  treatment  duration  of  12  months.  A  secondary analysis  was  to  be  done  after  a  follow  up  period  of  another  year  of  treatment  resulting  in  a  total treatment duration of 2 years.

## Methods

Fig 6. Study plan for study CL2-032

<!-- image -->

The randomisation of treatment was unbalanced with a 2/1 ratio (for ethical reasons, not to expose unnecessarily many subjects to placebo) and stratified by country.

Dose selection In SOTI and TROPOS study, the dose of 2 g of strontium ranelate was shown to significantly reduce the risk of fractures and to increase the lumbar and femoral BMD in post-menopausal women. A similar dose was chosen in this study, since pharmacokinetics of S 12911 have been shown to be comparable in healthy elderly males and healthy post-menopausal females following a single dose of 2 g strontium ranelate (PKH-12911-012 study). Efficacy assessments Sample size Sample size was estimated on the relative change in lumbar BMD from baseline to the last available post-baseline  value  until  M12  visit.  Assuming  a  common  standard  deviation  of  6%,  and  taking  into account the randomisation 2:1, 127 patients were necessary in the strontium ranelate group and 64 in placebo  group  (191  patients  overall)  to  establish  a  statistical  significant  difference  of  at  least  3% between  the  two  groups  with  a  power  of  at  least  90%.  Hypothesising  a  withdrawal  rate  and/or  a protocol violation rate of 15%, a total of 221 patients (147 into the strontium ranelate group and 74 into the placebo group) were to be included.

## Primary objective

The main objective of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy over a 1-year period of 2 g strontium ranelate compared to placebo in men with osteoporosis on BMD at the lumbar spine (L2-L4) similar to that observed in postmenopausal women. The primary assessment was lumbar L2-L4 BMD assessed at selection visit, M6, M12, M18, and M24.

## Secondary objectives were:

- To determine the efficacy of strontium ranelate over a one-year period compared to placebo in men with  osteoporosis  on  BMD  at  the  hip  (femoral  neck,  total  hip)  and  on  biochemical  markers  of  bone turnover: sCTX-I, bALP, PINP, sOC.

Study withdrawal Treatment  withdrawal: 57  patients  (21.8%)  prematurely  stopped  the  study  treatment;  42  patients (24.1%) in the strontium ranelate group and 15 (17.2 %) in the placebo group. Treatment withdrawal due to adverse events: 33 patients (12.6%) prematurely stopped the treatment due to adverse events, 13.8% of patients in the strontium ranelate group (24 patients). In addition, one patient who never took the study treatment withdrew from the study at the M3 visit. 10.3% of patients in the placebo group (9 patients). One patient who never took the study treatment withdrew from the study at the M3 visit. 4  patients  (2.3%)  were  withdrawn  from  the  treatment  due  to  protocol  deviations  in  the  strontium ranelate group. After study unblinding, the following change was made to the statistical analysis plan: To study the impact of withdrawals on the main analysis, a sensitivity analysis on the relative change in lumbar L2L4 BMD was conducted, using multiple imputation, to deal with missing data by replacing the missing information  by  a  set  of  plausible  values,  according  to  the  distribution  of  the  imputed  variables  and covariates.  Thus,  missing  post-baseline  L2-L4  BMD  values  were  imputed,  using  the  information  on baseline BMD and treatments group. Moreover, a baseline carried forward analysis was also performed by the MAH. Baseline data Medicinal product no longer authorised

Compared with the baseline characteristics of the female population (integrated analysis of SOTI and TROPOS), male patients were of a similar age and BMI, had a slightly higher BMD at the lumbar spine, a markedly higher BMD at the femoral neck and total hip, and a lower prevalence of fractures at baseline. Medical  history: Most  patients  (98.5%)  reported  medical  and/or  surgical  history,  with  no  clinically relevant difference between groups.  Hypertension was the most frequently reported medical history (41.8%) followed by benign prostatic hyperplasia (26.1%). Treatment groups were globally comparable in term of medical history, even if history of hypertension and of myocardial ischaemia was slightly more frequent in the strontium ranelate group than in the placebo group (43.1% versus 41.8% respectively and 10.3% versus 3.4%, respectively). Concomitant  medication: At  study  inclusion,  most  patients  (84.7%)  were  taking  at  least  one concomitant  treatment,  most  frequent  being  antithrombotic  agents,  lipid  modifying  agents,  agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system and beta-blocking agents.

The effect size of the BMD increase at the lumbar spine for men in study CL3-032 is comparable to that observed in the female population of the SOTI and TROPOS study (integrated analysis) at 1 year: 197 men and 5175 women had available values for lumbar spine BMD at both baseline and M12 visit. The difference in mean relative increase from baseline to M12 between S 12911 and placebo was 6.38% and 7.04%, in men and in women, respectively (see table 16 below).

Mean global compliance was higher in the PPS (94.0 ± 8.2%) as compared to the FAS but regardless of the analysis set, no relevant differences between groups were detected. Primary efficacy results Table 15. Lumbar L2-L4 BMD relatives changes (%) from baseline to last value in the FAS After one year of treatment, the relative change from baseline to End in L2-L4 BMD was 7.05 ± 6.0% in the S 12911 group and 1.72 ± 4.4% in the placebo group, with a statistically significant difference between groups (E (SE) = 5.32 (0.7)%; 95%CI = [3.9;6.8]; p&lt;0.001). This result was confirmed by the sensitivity analysis adjusted for risk factors (age, prevalent vertebral fractures): E (SE) = 5.33 (0.75) %, 95% CI [3.86;6.80], p&lt;0.001.

Missing data: Lumbar L2-L4 BMD value at M12 was missing for 46 patients (19% of the patients from the FAS). In the main analysis, the conservative approach using the last value under treatment (End) was used to deal with these missing data. To further investigate their impact on the treatment effect estimate, an analysis using the multiple imputation method was performed. The results on the relative change in lumbar L2-L4 BMD from baseline to M12 in the FAS with a multiple imputation procedure are presented in Table 17 below.

Fig 7. Lumbar L2-L4 BMD relative (%) changes from baseline to M6 and M12, FAS study CL3-032 In the strontium ranelate group, the relative increases in lumbar L2-L4 BMD were 4.61 ± 4.56 % from baseline  to  M6  in  the  FAS  and  8.18  ±  5.92  %  from  baseline  to  M12.  During  the  same  periods,  an increase of low magnitude was observed in the placebo group: relative change from baseline to M6: 0.52  ±  4.36  %  and  from  baseline  to  M12:  1.79  ±  4.55%.  The  difference  between  groups  was significant at both visits; At M6: E (SE) = 4.09 (0.63)%, 95% CI = [2.85 ; 5.33], p &lt; 0.001, and at M12: E (SE) = 6.38 (0.81)%, 95% CI = [4.78 ; 7.98], p &lt; 0.001. In  the  strontium    ranlelate  group,  the  lumbar  L2-L4  BMD  increased  by  0.037  ±  0.036  g/cm²  from baseline to M6 in the FAS and by 0.066 ± 0.046 g/cm² from baseline to M12. In the placebo group, no relevant changes from baseline were detected: 0.003 ± 0.037 g/cm² at M6 and 0.013 ± 0.038 g/cm² at M12. Changes from baseline to last value were close to those observed from baseline to M12. At both  visits  and  at  last  evaluation,  the  between-group  differences  in  changes  from  baseline  were significant (p &lt; 0.001). Medicinal product no longer authorised

The estimate of the between-group difference E (SE) = 6.25 (0.79)% was higher than that obtained with the main statistical approach ( i.e. 5.32 (0.75)%), and the difference between groups was highly significant  (p  &lt;  0.001).  The  estimate  at  M12  with  imputation  was  close  to  the  estimate  obtained without  imputation  ( i.e. 6.38  (0.81)%,  see  below),  indicating  that  the  impact  of  drop-outs  on  the estimation of the treatment effect was low.

A significantly greater increase in femoral neck BMD from baseline to last value was observed in the strontium ranelate group as compared with the placebo group (mean relative change 3.12 % versus 0.22%, for strontium ranelate and placebo, respectively). The absolute and relative BMD changes in the strontium ranelate group were smaller at the femoral neck than at the lumbar spine, and almost no change occurred in the placebo group at the femoral neck. The change from baseline to last value in total  hip  BMD in  the  strontium  ranelate  group  was  small (mean relative change 2.42%), but significantly higher than in the placebo group (0.49%). The absolute and relative changes in femoral neck BMD in men are comparable to those in the female SOTI/TROPOS population: For 178 men and 5092 women values at both baseline and M12 for femoral neck  and  total  hip  are  available.  The  relative  placebo-corrected  increases  in  femoral  neck  BMD  are 3.19% and 3.52%, for men and women, respectively. For total  hip  BMD, the  relative  and  absolute changes in men are smaller than in women: the relative placebo-corrected increase was 1.77% in men versus 4.34% in women (see table 20 below).

Lumbar L2-L4  BMD  increased  significantly  more  (p&lt;0.001)  months  in  the  strontium  ranelate  group than in the placebo group during the 12 months observation period. The difference between treatment groups was 6.38 %, which is comparable to the difference between treatment groups at 12 months in the  PMO  studies  (7.0  %).  Femoral  neck  BMD  as  well  as  total  hip  BMD  was  significantly  higher (p&lt;0.001) in the strontium ranelate group than in the placebo group after 12 months in male study CL3-032. These differences between treatment groups are comparable to what had earlier been seen in the PMO pivotal studies for Protelos. Bone formation marker B-ALP did not significantly decrease in the strontium ranelate group during the 12 months observation period in study CL3-032 while bone resorption marker s-CTX was significantly higher in the placebo group than in the strontium ranelate group. There was a trend towards better quality of life in the strontium ranelate group after 12 months of treatment, however significance was reached only for sleep interfering pain.

The changes in quality of life were modest in both groups, with slightly greater proportions of improved patients in the strontium ranelate group vs placebo in all items. Subgroup analyses Not applicable. 2.4.3. Discussion In  view  of  the  available  background  data  from  the  nonclinical  studies,  PK  study  and  PMO  pivotal studies, the choice of dose and treatment schedules are justified. The choice of efficacy assessments parameters were reasonable and in line with those in the pivotal PMO studies. Study withdrawal rate was high, higher than calculated and higher in the strontium ranelate group than in the placebo group; and it was higher than in the pivotal PMO studies. More patients withdrew due to adverse events and to  protocol  violation  in  study  CL3-032  study  than  in  the  PMO  pivotal  studies.  The  dropout  rate  for patients treated with strontium ranelate in the SOTI and TROPOS studies in PMO was however lower than in this study. Additional sensitivity analyses performed show that the result seems robust and is supported also with a more conservative approach, e.g. a baseline carried forward analysis, than what was initially used in the main analysis.

Study  CL3-032  was  not  powered  to  show  any  statistically  significant  difference  between  groups  in terms  of  the  reduction  of  vertebral  fractures.  Overall,  the  number  of  new  fractures  reported  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study was low: After 2 years, 6 patients (3.5%) in the strontium ranelate group and 4 patients (4.6%) in  the  placebo  group  reported  a  non-vertebral  fracture.  Numerically,  the  incidence  of  morphometric vertebral fractures over 2 years was lower in the strontium ranelate (5.1%) than in the placebo group (6.9%).

According to the osteoporosis guideline (CPMP/EWP/552/95, Rev 2, 2006) the applicant should justify that the inclusion criteria chosen for the pivotal study in osteoporotic men generate a fracture risk of a similar magnitude to that of women included in the phase III pivotal studies in postmenopausal osteoporosis.  for whom antifracture effect was demonstrated. Males in study CL3-032 had fewer prevalent osteoporotic fractures at baseline than females included in the PMO studies for Protelos, and more men were treated with antiosteogenic agents at baseline. The MAH argues that this is inevitable, due to ethical reasons and to development of medical praxis since the time of initiation of these female PMO studies. Males in CL3-032 are considered to be at a high risk of fracture at baseline and the male population had a pronounced vertebral osteoporosis at baseline.

In  conclusion,  BMD  in  lumbar  spine  (primary  efficacy  parameter)  as  well  as  secondary  efficacy parameters total hip BMD and femoral neck BMD were significantly better after 12 months treatment with  strontium  ranelate,  as  compared  to  placebo.  Results  are  comparable  with  those  previously demonstrated  in  a  female  postmenopausal  osteoporosis  population.  The  proposed  post-marketing study is supported and it is considered that such an observational survey could indeed yield meaningful information on the efficacy and safety of strontium ranelate treatment of male osteoporosis in clinical use.

It is acknowledged that it would have been difficult to include men with 2 or more prevalent fractures in a two-year placebo controlled study, given that effective treatment of osteoporotic men at high risk of fractures is available. It is also agreed that the male trial population was of sufficiently high fracture risk to justify anti-osteoporosis treatment in accordance with current treatment guidelines. Nonetheless, the fracture risk calculated with the FRAX tool clearly differs between the male and female trial populations: The 10-year probabilities of major osteoporotic fracture and of hip fracture were 10.1% and 5.4%, respectively, for men in study CL3-032, versus 24.3% and 13.0%, respectively, for women in the PMO studies. Additional  analyses  comparing  the  treatment  effect  in  a  risk  matched  female  and  male  population indicate comparable BMD increase and are considered supportive, even if comparability is shown only for the surrogate endpoint BMD and not for the fracture risk. According to post-hoc analysis from the PMO studies, the anti-fracture efficacy of strontium ranelate was  significant  whatever  the  main  determinants  of  vertebral  fracture  risks:  age,  baseline  BMD, prevalent  fractures,  family  history  of  osteoporosis,  baseline  body  mass  index  (BMI),  addiction  to smoking and baseline level of bone turnover (Roux, 2006; Collette, 2007). Recent publications suggest that the effectiveness of strontium ranelate on clinical fractures and morphometric fractures in PMO women is comparable over the whole range of FRAX probabilities (Kanis 2011). Given  the  issue  of  comparable  fracture  risk  of  the  male  and  female  study  populations,  the  MAH proposes  to  conduct  an  observational  cohort  survey  to  evaluate  the  incidence  of  fractures  and  the adherence and tolerability of strontium ranelate in osteoporotic men treated with strontium ranelate in the  post-marketing  setting.  The  non-interventional  survey  is  planned  for  3-years  and  would  include 3000 men with primary osteoporosis, according to sample size calculations. The MAH assumes that approximately 162 fractures would be observed during the 3-year follow up. At entry in the trial, the necessary information to calculate a 10-year fracture risk using FRAX (Kanis 2008) will be recorded. Medicinal product no longer authorised

A total  of  215  patients  (82.7%)  experienced  at  least  one  AE  requiring  either  a  new  treatment  or  a surgical or medical procedure. The proportion of affected patients was lower in the strontium ranelate group:  138  patients  (79.8%)  than  in  the  placebo  group:  77  patients  (88.5%).  The  AEs  requiring  a surgical or medical procedure were mainly related to gastrointestinal disorders: 2.9% in the strontium ranelate group versus 5.7% in the placebo group and cardiac disorders: 3.5% and 3.4%, respectively. Treatment related AEs Of all reported AEs, 40 patients (23.1%) reported 72 treatment-related emergent AEs in the strontium ranelate group and 23 patients (26.4%) reported 35 treatment-related emergent AEs in the placebo group.

## Adverse events during the 2-year treatment period

Over  the  2-year  period,  91.2%  of  patients  experienced  at  least  one  treatment  emergent  AE  with  a lower incidence in the strontium ranelate (88.4%) than in the placebo group (96.6%). The incidence of AEs  leading  to  treatment  withdrawal  (mainly  related  to  gastrointestinal  disorders  and  skin  and subcutaneous  tissue  disorders)  was  higher  in  the  strontium  ranelate  group;  a  difference  that manifested early in  the  study.  The  incidence  of  SAEs  in  the  strontium  ranelate  (29.5%)  and  in  the placebo (29.9%) groups were similar.

The most frequently affected SOCs were musculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders (30.1% in the strontium ranelate group versus 39.1% in the placebo group), gastrointestinal disorders (30.1% and 29.9%, respectively), infection and infestation disorders (29.5% and 35.6%, respectively). More frequently reported in the strontium ranelate group were the SOCs 'Investigations' (16.2% vs 14.9%), 'Cardiac disorders' (16.2% vs 13.8%), 'Skin and subcutaneous disorders' (14.5% vs 11.5%). The SOC vascular  disorders  (which  showed  a  higher  incidence  in  the  strontium  ranelate  group  than  in  the placebo  group  after  the  first  year  (11.0%  vs  8.0%)  showed  by  the  end  of  the  second  year  similar incidences in the 2 groups (16.8% vs 16.1%); this was also reflected in the incidence of hypertension (10.4 % vs 11.5%).

Regarding the SOC investigations, the difference between the groups over 2 years (16.2% vs 14.9%) was less than was observed at 1 year (11.0% vs 5.7%). The minor between-group differences were noted in the rates of investigations of increased blood creatinine. Among the 5 patients on strontium ranelate  for  whom  an  adverse  event  'blood  creatinine  increased'  has  been  reported,  3  patients  had already  reported  an  out  of  range  value  (upper  threshold)  at  the  Selection  visit  (127 μ mol/L,  117 μ mol/L  and  118 μ mol/L,  respectively).  For  the  2  other  patients,  a  mild  creatinine  increase  was observed at M012 (&lt;130 μ mol/L) and the values were then stabilised on study treatment. These AEs were not serious and did not lead to treatment withdrawal. The  incidence  of cardiac  disorders was  higher  in  the  strontium  ranelate  group  than  in  the  placebo group  (16.2%  vs  13.8%)  over  2  years,  mainly  due  to  ischaemic  coronary  artery  disease  (HLGT): angina pectoris (4% vs 0%), myocardial infarction (acute or not) (1.7% versus 1.1%) and myocardial ischemia (1.2% vs 0%). This could be explained by the higher percentage of patients in the strontium ranelate group as compared to the placebo group having a medical history of ischemic coronary artery disorder  (16.1%  versus  11.5%,  respectively)  and  in  particular,  myocardial  ischemia  (10.3%  versus 3.4%, respectively) and also of glucose metabolism disorders (11.0% versus 6.9%) and hypertension (42.8% versus 39.1%). The CV events were not considered treatment related by the investigators as they occurred in patients with significant cardiovascular risk factors and/or history of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. Over 2 years, a higher incidence of AEs in the SOC subcutaneous and tissue disorders was reported in the strontium ranelate group than in placebo group (14.5% vs 11.5%, respectively). This was mainly related  to  erythemas  (1.2%  vs  none,  respectively), rashes  (1.2%  versus  none,  respectively)  and urticaria (1.7% vs 1.1%, respectively). None were serious. Serious adverse events and deaths Deaths Three patients died during the study, 2 in the S 12911 group and one in the placebo group. None of the  deaths  were  considered  related  to  the  study  drug  by  the  investigator.  The  cause  of  death  was unknown for two patients (who had a heavy history of cardiac disorders)   in the strontium ranelate group while one patient in the placebo group died of cerebral hemorrhage.

The percentage of patients experiencing an emergent SAE in the strontium ranelate group (51 out of 173 patients: 29.5%) and in the placebo group (26 out of 87 patients: 29.9%) were similar over two years.  The  most  frequently  reported  emergent  SAEs  in  the  strontium  ranelate  group  were  cardiac disorders (6.4% vs 4.6%) and gastrointestinal disorders (4.0% vs 1.1%).

Regarding the SOC 'cardiac disorders', the higher incidence of SAEs in the strontium ranelate group was mainly due to cases of myocardial ischemia, and to cardiac arrhythmia (1.2% versus none). It

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

might be noted that more patients reported a medical history of cardiac arrhythmia in the strontium ranelate group than in the placebo group (18.4% versus 11.5%).

Regarding the SOC 'Gastrointestinal disorders', the higher incidence of SAE in the strontium ranelate group was mainly due to cases of inguinal hernia (1.7% vs 0%). More patients reported a medical history of abdominal hernias in the strontium ranelate group than in the placebo group (23.0% versus 14.9%).

During the first year of treatment, 2 patients in the strontium ranelate group presented with a deep vein thrombosis. One 75 years old patient experienced a DVT of the right femoral vein 168 days after the first drug intake. One 66 years old patient with a history of hypercholesterolemia experienced a DVT of the left femoral vein 130 days after the first drug intake. The events were recovering in both patients  when they dropped-out from the study. During the second year, one further patient in the same  group  experienced  a  suspected  pulmonary  embolism.  This  was  a  78-year-old  patient,  with  a medical history of stroke, who was hospitalised 17 months after the first study drug intake for an acute appendicitis.  7  days  after  surgery  he  experienced  dyspnoea  with  a  suspected  pulmonary  embolism. The  study  drug  had  been  stopped  at  entry  to  hospital.  The  patient  recovered.  The  event  was considered by the investigator as not related to the study drug. Comparison with PMO Since  strontium  ranelate  is  not  a  hormonal  treatment,  no  gender  differences  are  expected  in  the occurrence of emergent AEs. The most frequently emergent AEs reported in the CL3-032 study (men) were compared with the frequencies reported in the PMO studies (women) after 2 years of treatment. The randomisation (strontium ranelate: placebo) was unbalanced in CL3-032 study (with a ratio 2:1) while it was balanced in the PMO studies. It should also be noted that there was higher rate of comorbidities  in  the  male  population  with,  in  the  men,  more  coronary  artery  disease  25.7%  (versus 17.2% in the women), and more metabolism disorders 37.9% (versus 18.4% in the women) mainly related to hypercholesterolaemia 22.2% (vs 11.3%) or glucose metabolism disorders 9.6% (vs 5.1%).

The imbalance in the incidence of emergent coronary artery disorders (HLGT) reported in men (8.7% in the strontium ranelate group vs 4.6% in the placebo group) was not observed in women in the PMO studies  (5.1%  vs  4.8%).  This  could  be  explained  by  the  difference  in  the  medical  histories  of  the populations,  with  in  the  CL3-032  study  higher  rates  of  ischemic  coronary  artery  disorders  and myocardial ischemia in particular, reported in the strontium ranelate group as compared to the placebo group (16.1% versus 11.5%, respectively, for ischemic CAD and 10.3% versus 3.4% respectively for ischemia).

AEs related to skin and subcutaneous disorders were also more frequently reported in men (14.5% vs 11.5%) than in the PMO women (10.1% vs 8.3%), probably due to the risk minimization measures set up in the Risk management plan: i.e patients are informed 'to stop PROTELOS/OSSEOR immediately

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and permanently when a rash occurs and to seek medical advice.' However the differences between the 2 groups in men and in PMO women were comparable.

Over 2 years, despite the higher prevalence of comorbidities in men than in women, the proportion of serious emergent AEs in the CL3-032 study was similar in the strontium ranelate group (29.5%) to the placebo  group  (29.9%).  The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  in  the  strontium  ranelate-treated  men were coronary artery disorders (6.4% vs 4.6%) and gastrointestinal disorders (4.0% vs 1.1%) mainly explained by abdominal hernias. In the PMO studies, there were no abdominal hernias in the strontium ranelate group vs 0.1% in the placebo group.

Regarding venous thromboembolism ,  in  the  CL3-032 study, the annual incidence of thromboembolic events  (1.06%  for  strontium  ranelate  group)  is  consistent  with  that  observed  in  the  whole  male population  aged  of  more  than  65  years,  based  on  data  coming  from  the  General  Practice  Research Database (GPRD) in the United Kingdom (0.96% of VTE). The incidence observed in men was slightly higher that the annual incidence observed in PMO studies (0.9% in the strontium ranelate group). Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation In the CL3-032 study, the incidence of treatment withdrawals due to AE was higher in the strontium ranelate group (17.9%, 31 patients out of 173) than in the placebo group (13.8%, 12 patients out of 87). In the PMO studies, the incidence of treatment withdrawals due to AE was higher in the strontium ranelate group (18.1%) than in the placebo group (15.2%). Medicinal product no longer authorised

No clinically relevant changes over time or differences between groups were detected. Mean CPK value increased from baseline to end in the strontium ranelate group (mean ± SD: from 106.3 ± 57.1 IU/L to 125.5 ± 68.9 IU/L), whereas it remained stable in the placebo group (from 103.6 ± 56.5 IU/L to 105.6  ±  58.5  IU/L).  There  was  no  potentially  clinically  significant  abnormal  value  in  the  strontium ranelate group (i.e. no values &gt; 3 ULN) and there was no relevant between-group difference in the proportion of patients with a value above the upper limit of the normal range (6 patients, 3.8%,  in the strontium  ranelate  group versus 4  patients,  4.9%,    in  the  placebo  group).  There  was  a  trend  to  a decrease in blood calcium (-0.06 ± 0.09 mmol/L) and to an increase in blood phosphorus (+0.15 ± 0.16 mmol/L)  in  the strontium ranelate group. These  changes  in phosphocalcic  homeostasis

In addition, in the strontium ranelate group two 'sudden deaths' occurred in patients who had a heavy history  of  cardiac  disorders.  Over  2  years  of  treatment  17.9%  of  patients  in  the  strontium  ranelate group experienced an AE which led to treatment discontinuation compared to 14.8% in placebo group. The  between-group  difference  after  2  years  of  treatment  (3.5%)  was  the  same  as  after  1  year  of treatment.  Already  apparent  within  the  first  6  months  of  the  trial,  the  between-group  difference  is largely explained by discontinuations due to events concerning gastro-intestinal disorders or skin and subcutaneous disorders.

parameters  probably  related  to  the  mechanism  of  action  of  strontium  ranelate  were  observed  in previous studies.  Neither  clinically  relevant  changes  nor  differences  between  groups  over  time  were detected for haematological parameters.

In  the  Safety  Set,  emergent  out-of  reference  value  values  were  more  frequently  reported  in  the strontium ranelate group than in the placebo group for the following biochemical parameters:

- Low calcemia: 52 patients (33.1%) and 4 patients (4.9%), respectively.
- High value of serum phosphorus: 22 patients (14.0%) and 1 patients (1.2%), respectively).

-  High  creatininaemia:  16  patients  (11.4%)  in  the  S  12911  group versus 4  patients  (5.5%)  in  the placebo  group.  None  of  these  high  creatinine  values  was  potentially  clinically  significant  (&gt;  180 μ mol/L). For these patients, no specific change regarding creatinine clearance was observed. Electrocardiograms: No  relevant  between-group  differences  were  detected.  No  relevant  increase  in mean corrected QT interval was observed in S 12911 treated patients, whatever the correction formula used. Safety in special populations Not applicable. 2.5.3. Discussion The safety in men with primary osteoporosis observed in the phase III study was broadly similar to that  described  in  women  with  postmenopausal  osteoporosis,  although  long-term  safety  data  are missing. Twenty-four months of follow-up data showed that the total incidence of AEs over 2 years was lower in the strontium ranelate group than in the placebo group (88.4 versus 96.6 %), although the incidence of  SAEs  was  similar  between  groups  (29.5  %  in  the  strontium  ranelate  group  and  29.9  %  in  the placebo group). In particular, adverse events of coronary heart disorders, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were more common in the strontium ranelate group than in the control group. The most frequently reported SAE in the strontium ranelate group were cardiac disorders and gastrointestinal disorders (6.4 % and 4.6 %; 4.0 % and 1.1 %). During the first year of treatment, 2 patients in the strontium ranelate group had an SAE of deep vein thrombosis, none in the placebo group. During the second year, a patient in the strontium ranelate group suffered a suspected pulmonary embolism. Although the rate of venous thromboembolism in the male study does not exceed that of the general population of the same age, it is striking that all cases of venous thromboembolim were seen in the strontium ranelate treatment arm. Also, a greater risk of skin disorders with strontium ranelate than with placebo was confirmed. These findings are expected and the SmPC and RMP were updated with reference to these safety concerns as part of the recent Art. 20 referral procedure. Medicinal product no longer authorised

It is noted that the males in the CL3-032 study had more baseline co-morbidities than the females in the  PMO  studies.  The  fact  that  renal  and  urinary  tract  investigations  and  urinanalyses  were    more common in the male than in the female study population can probably be attributed to the common occurrence of benign prostate hyperplasia in elderly males. The incidence of hepatobiliary investigations was also higher in the male study population (2.9 % in the strontium ranelate group, versus 0.6 % in the corresponding female study population). Coronary artery disorders and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were also more common among strontium ranelate treated males than

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

among the corresponding group of females in the PMO studies. These differences may be due to higher baseline morbidity in the male study population as claimed by the MAH.

Myocardial ischemia was more common in the strontium ranelate group (1.2 versus 0 %). In study CL3-032,  more  patients  in  the  strontium  ranelate  group  had  a  history  of  cardiac  arrhythmia.  This difference in incidence of cardiac events was not seen in the PMO studies.

A higher percentage of patients in the strontium ranelate group as compared to the placebo group had a  medical  history  of  ischaemic  coronary  artery  disease  (16.2%  versus  11.5%,  respectively),  in particular,  myocardial  ischaemia  (10.4%  versus  3.4%,  respectively),    glucose  metabolism  disorders (11.0%  versus  6.9%)  and  hypertension  (42.8%  versus  39.1%).  Thus,  the  rate  of  relevant  comorbidities was unbalanced between the treatment groups. However, it is acknowledged, that the trial was not designed to assess cardiovascular safety.

The relative risk of ischaemic heart disease in the strontium ranelate group compared to placebo was not significantly increased in neither of the trials, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.24 [0.49;3.17] in the  CL3-032  study,  1.13  [0.95;1.34]  and  0.83  [0.58;1.18]  in  the  TROPOS  and  SOTI  studies, respectively.  Considering  the  difficulties  in  the  interpretation  of  these  findings,  the  RMP  has  been updated with the addition of cardiac events as missing information. Further, the MAH has proposed to perform a specific study in osteoporotic patients to further assess the risk of ischaemic cardiac events, using the GPRD database. This observational retrospective study will use a population-based cohort to assess the risk of ischemic cardiac events, and a nested case-control study to investigate the potential association  with  strontium  ranelate.  Multivariate  analyses  taking  into  account  risk  and  confounding factors will be implemented. This proposal is endorsed by the CHMP. Due  to  the  safety  concerns  discussed  above,  the  new  indication  in  men  and  the  lack  of  long-term safety data in this population, the MAH should continue to submit 6 monthly PSURs instead of yearly PSURs, unless otherwise notified by the CHMP. Annex II and the RMP have been updated accordingly to reflect this request. 2.6. Risk management plan The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan within this variation procedure, which included a risk minimisation plan. Table  36.

2.7. Changes to the Product Information The following changes to the SmPC were agreed following the assessment of all data provided: 4.1 Therapeutic indications OSSEOR is indicated in adults. Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women to reduce the risk of vertebral and hip fractures (see section 5.1). Treatment of osteoporosis in men at increased risk of fracture (see section 5.1). 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy OSSEOR is only intended for use in postmenopausal women. There are no data from the use of strontium ranelate in pregnant women. 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Treatment of Osteoporosis in men: The efficacy of  OSSEOR was demonstrated in men with osteoporosis in a 2-year, doubleblind,placebo-controlled study with a main analysis after one year in 243 patients (Intention to treatpopulation, 161 patients received strontium ranelate) at high risk of fracture (mean age 72,7 years; mean lumbar BMD T-score value of -2.6; 28% of prevalent vertebral fracture). All patients received daily supplemental calcium (1000 mg) and vitamin D (800 UI). Statistically  significant  increases  in  BMD  were  observed  as  early  as  6  months  following initiation of OSSEOR treatment versus placebo. Over 12 months, a statistically significant increase in mean lumbar spine BMD, main efficacy criteria (E (SE) = 5.32% (0.75); 95%CI = [3.86 ; 6.79]; p&lt;0,001), similar to that observed in  the  pivotal  anti-fracture  phase  III  studies  carried-out  inpostmenopausal  women,  was observed. Statistically  significant  increases  in  femoral  neck  BMD  and  total  hip  BMD  (p&lt;0,001)  were observed after 12 months. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Medicinal product no longer authorised

Strontium  ranelate  is  made  up  of  2  atoms  of  stable  strontium  and  1  molecule  of  ranelic  acid,  the organic  part  permitting  the  best  compromise  in  terms  of  molecular  weight,  pharmacokinetics  and acceptability of the medicinal product. The pharmacokinetics of strontium and ranelic acid have been assessed  in  healthy  young  men  and  healthy  postmenopausal  women,  as  well  as  during  long-term exposure in  men  with  osteoporosis  and postmenopausal  osteoporotic  women  including  elderly women.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  following  changes  to  the  Package  Leaflet  were  agreed  following  the  assessment  of  all  data provided:

## 1. WHAT OSSEOR IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR

OSSEOR is a non-hormonal medicine used to treat osteoporosis:

……

-In postmenopausal women to reduce the risk of fracture at the spine and at the hip; -In men at increased risk of fracture. 2. BEFORE YOU TAKE OSSEOR Pregnancy and breast-feeding: OSSEOR is meant for use only in postmenopausal women. Therefore, do Do not take OSSEOR during  pregnancy  or  when  you  are  breastfeeding.  If  you  take  it  by  accident  during  pregnancy  or breastfeeding, stop taking it straight away and talk to your doctor. In addition, upon request by the CHMP during the procedure, Annex II has been updated to reflect the fact that the MAH should provide 6-monthly PSURs unless otherwise specified by the Committee. 'PSURs The  MAH  will  continue  to  submit 1-yearly 6  monthly PSURs,  unless  otherwise  specified  by  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).' 3. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance Benefits Beneficial effects The  submitted  non-clinical  data  provide  support  for  the  efficacy  of  strontium  ranelate  in  male osteoporosis.  Prevention/restoration  of  trabecular  bone  loss  and  changes  in  trabecular  architecture were  demonstrated  in  a  preventive  study  over  52  weeks  and  in  a  curative  study  over  44  weeks, respectively,  in  male  orchidectomised  rats  (a  relevant  animal  model  of  male  osteoporosis).  The strontium ranelate dose  of  625  mg/kg/day used in the curative study is considered relevant as the achieved exposure correlates to roughly 1.3- to 2-fold the exposure in men. The  pharmacokinetic  data  provided  in  males  and  the  comparative  population  PK/PD  data  from osteoporotic males and females do not suggest any differences in exposure that would necessitate a dose adjustment in the male population compared to postmenopausal females. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The pivotal trial (CL3-032) to support the new indication is a randomized, double-blind bridging study in men with primary osteoporosis (n=261) treated daily with 2g of strontium ranelate or placebo for two years. BMD at the lumbar spine after one year of treatment was the primary outcome; secondary efficacy  criteria  analysed  were  femoral  neck  and  total  hip  BMD,  bone  markers  and  quality  of  life. Efficacy on the primary endpoint was sufficiently demonstrated: The relative change of measured BMD at the lumbar spine (L2-L4) from baseline to last on treatment value was 7.05±6.00% in the strontium ranelate  group  (n=161)  versus  1.72±4.44%  in  the  placebo  group  (n=82);  the  difference  between

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

groups was statistically significant [5.32% (SE 0.75); 95%CI (3.86; 6.79), p&lt;0.001]. Similar results were obtained from a sensitivity analysis adjusted for age and prevalent vertebral fractures. Results from the secondary analyses on the change of femoral neck and hip BMD were in line with the primary outcome.

The effect size of the BMD increase at the lumbar spine for men in study CL3-032 is comparable to that observed in the postmenopausal females in the SOTI and TROPOS studies (integrated analysis) after 1 year  of  treatment:  The  relative  increase  [mean  (SE)]  from  baseline  to  M12  was  6.38%  (0.81)  and 7.04% (0.35), in strontium ranelate treated men and women, respectively. Similar effect sizes for both genders were also demonstrated for the absolute change in lumbar BMD and at the femoral neck level.

Secondary analyses of bone turnover markers and quality of life point in the right direction, but do not add strong support. A somewhat different pattern of change of the bone formation marker b-ALP in the male CL3-032 and in the female SOTI study was observed and it was discussed, whether this could be viewed as an index of a gender specific mechanism of action. Based on the provided literature and taking  all  other  bone  marker  data  provided  into  account,  this  difference  seems  to  reflect  biological differences.  The  treatment  effect  on  the  b-ALP  levels  in  the  male  CL3-032  study  is  higher  in  the strontium ranelate group than in the placebo group at every time point, similar to what was observed in the SOTI study.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects There is a difference in the effect size between the male and female study populations at the total hip level:  the  relative  change in hip BMD from baseline to 12 months was 1.77% (0.67) in men versus 4.34% (0.13) in PMO women. Study CL3-032 was not powered to show a statistically significant difference between groups on the reduction of osteoporotic fractures. Overall, the number of new fractures observed in the study was low,  with  6  patients  (3.5%)  in  the  strontium  ranelate  group  and  4  patients  (4.6%)  in  the  placebo group  reporting  a  non-vertebral  fracture  after  2  years.  Assessable  X-ray  data  at  baseline  and  post baseline  (under  treatment)  from  184  patients  (120  in  the  strontium  ranelate  group  and  64  in  the placebo  group)  indicate  that  the  incidence  of  morphometric  vertebral  fractures  over  2  years (centralised X-ray assessment) was lower in the strontium ranelate than in the placebo group (5.1% and 6.9%, respectively). Justification of inclusion criteria that will generate a fracture risk of a similar magnitude in the male study population as compared with the postmenopausal females included in the phase III studies is essential  for  acceptance  of  the  minimum  requirement  for  granting  the  indication  for  treatment  of osteoporosis in men based on bridging studies. To further substantiate comparable fracture risk of the male and female study populations, the MAH applied the FRAX® tool to the CL3-032 study data.  For the female study population fracture risk analyses have been published earlier (Kanis, 2011). There is a considerable difference in the fracture risk estimates between the male and female study population: Men  in  study  CL3-032  had  10-year  probabilities  of  major  osteoporotic  fracture  and  hip  fracture  of 10.1% and 5.4% respectively, versus 24.3% and 13.0%, respectively, as calculated for women in the PMO studies. Additional  analyses  comparing  the  treatment  effect  in  a  risk  matched  female  and  male  population indicate comparable BMD increase and are considered supportive, even if comparability is shown only for the surrogate endpoint BMD and not for the fracture risk. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Comparability of passive bone strontium content in men and women was questioned in order to clarify if  the proportion Δ BMD accounted for by passive presence of strontium in bone might differ between men and women, which then could result in an overestimation of BMD in males. Although some doubt

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

remains for methodological reasons, the additional analysis of data from non-clinical studies in male and female rats does not seem to indicate a gender specific difference in bone strontium content.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

In general, the safety profile for strontium ranelate in the male osteoporosis study CL3-032 did not markedly differ from that in female osteoporosis studies, where safety evaluation is based on much larger numbers and longer observation periods.

Overall, 63 (24.2%) patients experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event considered as related to the study treatment by the investigator; 23.1% in the strontium ranelate group versus 26.4%  in  the  placebo  group.  The  system  organ  classes  most  commonly  affected  in  the  strontium ranelate  group  were  gastrointestinal  disorders  (6.4%)  and  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders (6.9%). Discontinuation  of  treatment  due  to  adverse  events  occurred  more  frequently  in  patients  in  the strontium  ranelate  group  than  in  the  placebo  group  (13.9%  vs.  10.3%).  Discontinuation  of  therapy was  mainly  due  to  gastrointestinal  disorders  similarly  reported  in  both  groups  (3.5%  vs.  3.4%). Treatment  emergent  adverse  events  that  led  to  treatment  discontinuation  more  frequently  in  the strontium ranelate group were skin and subcutaneous disorders, headache and deep vein thrombosis. In the strontium ranelate group two patients (1.2%) experienced a deep vein thrombosis versus none in the placebo group. According to the GPRD database the overall incidence of DVT in the general male population  over  65  years  of  age  is  0.96%.  Increased  risk  of  VTE  was  observed  in  the  female  PMO studies and an approximately 50% increase in the annual risk for VTE including PE is described in the EPAR for Osseor/Protelos. Mild CPK elevations (i.e. values &lt; 3 ULN) were observed in study CL3-032. An impact of treatment with strontium ranelate on skeletal muscle cell integrity had been reported in the female population. Serious adverse events were more common in the strontium ranelate group than in the placebo group even though numbers of specific serious adverse events did not significantly differ between groups. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects The safety in men with primary osteoporosis observed in the phase III study was broadly similar to that described in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, but long-term safety data are missing and the number of male patients treated with strontium ranelate is small. Medicinal product no longer authorised

A  discrepancy  in  cardiac  events  between  treatment  groups  in  study  CL3-032  was  observed  and  a comparison between cardiac adverse events in study CL3-032 and the PMO studies was requested. A higher percentage of patients in the strontium ranelate group as compared to the placebo group had a medical history of ischaemic coronary artery disease (16.2% versus 11.5%, respectively), in particular, myocardial  ischaemia  (10.4%  versus  3.4%,  respectively),    glucose  metabolism  disorders  (11.0% versus 6.9%) and hypertension (42.8% versus 39.1%). Thus, the rate of relevant co-morbidities was unbalanced  between  the  treatment  groups.  Furthermore,  it  is  acknowledged  that  the  trial  was  not designed to assess cardiovascular safety.

Theoretically, there is some concern regarding potential long-term consequences of skeletal accretion of strontium, though no negative findings have emerged in the female population so far.

## Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

With the ageing of the population, osteoporosis in men  is increasingly recognized as an epidemiologically  relevant  health  problem.  According  to  literature,  one  out  of  three  osteoporosisrelated fractures occurs in men. Osteoporotic fractures can have severe consequences for the mostly elderly  individuals  and  are  associated  with  significant  morbidity  and  mortality.  A  treatment  that achieves reduction of fractures in the increasing population of elderly osteoporotic men at increased risk of fractures can be considered of great benefit at the individual level as well as at a population level.

The Osteoporosis guideline (CPMP/EWP/552/95 Rev.2) defines minimal requirements for granting an indication for the treatment of osteoporosis in men at increased risk of fracture. As far as duration of the study and justification of the dose are concerned, the present application fulfils these requirements. Inclusion criteria chosen for men in the pivotal study should 'generate a fracture risk of a similar magnitude compared with the postmenopausal women that were recruited in the studies used to  obtain  the  indication Treatment  of  postmenopausal  osteoporosis  in  women  at  increased  risk  of fracture '. The guideline does not provide exact guidance on how the bridging from a male osteoporosis study to earlier PMO studies with the same drug should be undertaken.

Pharmacologic therapy for osteoporosis is indicated in men with T-scores below -2.5 or below -1 with a prevalent  fragility  fracture.  Available  treatments  in  this  indication  are  the  oral  bisphosphonates alendronate and risedronate, and more recently intravenous zoledronate as well as teriparatide have been approved for use in osteoporotic men at high risk of fractures. The important safety issues of serious skin reactions such as DRESS, SJS and TEN and the risk of VTE associated with strontium ranelate were highlighted and re-assessed in the recent article 20 procedure. It  was  concluded  that  the  incidence  of  serious  skin  reactions  is  low  and  no  possible  mechanism  of action has been identified so far. The product information was updated to facilitate early diagnosis and mandate  immediate  discontinuation  of  treatment.  Use  of  strontium  ranelate  was  contraindicated  in patients with a history of VTE and in temporarily or permanently immobilised patients. Overall, while these adverse events can be serious and even life-threatening, they are rare and measures have been put in place that should help to reduce their occurrence and/or improve the management. Discussion on the effectiveness of these risk minimisation measures will be followed in the PSURs. While  there  was  a  discrepancy  in  cardiac  events  between  treatment  groups  in  study  CL3-032,  the study  was  too  small  and  not  powered  for  assessment  of  CV  safety  and  important  risk  factors  and relevant co-morbidities were unbalanced between the treatment groups.  The relative risk of ischaemic heart disease in the strontium ranelate group compared to placebo was not significantly increased in neither of the phase III trials, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.24 [0.49;3.17] in the CL3-032 study, 1.13 [0.95;1.34] and 0.83 [0.58;1.18] in the TROPOS and SOTI studies, respectively. Benefit-risk balance and discussion on the benefit-risk assessment Showing  efficacy  in  fracture  risk  reduction  is  regarded  as  the  most  relevant  endpoint  in  trials  of osteoporosis  treatments.  For  strontium  ranelate,  efficacy  in  fracture  risk  reduction  was  shown  in studies in PMO women. Changes in BMD correlate to the decrease in fracture risk. BMD measurement is therefore considered a valid surrogate endpoint in bridging studies. If the conditions of the bridging approach are fulfilled, efficacy based on BMD increase can be concluded.

The fracture risk calculated with the FRAX tool clearly differs between the male and female phase III study populations: The 10-year probabilities of major osteoporotic fracture and of hip fracture were 10.1% and 5.4% respectively, for men in study CL3-032, versus 24.3% and 13.0%, respectively, for

women in the PMO studies. The MAH attributes the large risk difference to the weight of prevalent osteoporotic fractures in the FRAX model: 28.0% of the men in study CL3-032 had prevalent vertebral fractures versus 48.1% of the PMO women; 36.0% of the men versus 63.5% of the PMO women had any prevalent osteoporotic fracture at baseline.

It is acknowledged that it would have been difficult to include men with 2 or more prevalent fractures in  a  two-year  placebo-controlled  study,  given  that  effective  treatment  is  available.  It  is  also  agreed that the male trial population was of sufficiently high fracture risk to justify anti-osteoporosis treatment in  accordance  with  current  treatment  guidelines.  Finally,  a  recent  publication  suggests  that  the effectiveness of strontium ranelate on clinical fractures and morphometric fractures in PMO women is comparable over the whole range of FRAX probabilities (Kanis 2011). Still, from a strictly regulatory point of view, the requirement of the applicable osteoporosis guideline is not fulfilled in this respect.

Finally,  to  address  some  limitations  concerning  the  evaluation  of  cardiovascular  safety  the  MAH proposes to perform a specific study in osteoporotic patients to further assess the risk of ischaemic cardiac events, using the GPRD database. This observational retrospective study will use a populationbased  cohort  to  assess  the  risk  of  ischemic  cardiac  events,  and  a  nested  case-control  study  to investigate the potential association with strontium ranelate. Multivariate analyses taking into account risk and confounding factors will be implemented. This proposal is endorsed.

Additional  analyses  comparing  the  treatment  effect  in  a  risk  matched  female  and  male  population indicate comparable BMD increase and are considered supportive, even if comparability is shown only for the surrogate endpoint BMD and not for the fracture risk. The GL further postulates that the magnitude of the BMD changes versus placebo should be similar to that observed in PMO women. Treatment effects in men were similar to those observed in the female study population at the lumbar spine and femoral neck. There is a difference in the effect size at the total  hip  level:  the  mean  (SE)  relative  change  in  hip  BMD  from  baseline  to  12  months  was  1.77% (0.67)  in  men  versus  4.34%  (0.13)  in  PMO  women.    However,  divergent  effect  sizes  in  men  and women of a similar range have been observed for other anti-osteoporotic drugs at the hip level. And a different distribution of trabecular and cortical bone, with more trabecular bone in PMO women than in men of the same age leading to greater BMD increases at the hip level, could be a plausible biological explanation. Finally,  the  GL  states  that  the  observed  BMD  changes  should  be  proportional  to  the  decreased incidence  of  fractures  in  treated  women.  This  was  shown  in  a  post  hoc  analysis  of  the  SOTI  and TROPOS data, where every 1% increase in femoral neck BMD was associated with a 3% reduction in the risk of a new vertebral fracture. Given the remaining restraint with regard to comparable fracture risk of the male and female study populations, the MAH proposes to conduct an observational cohort survey to evaluate the incidence of fractures  and  the  adherence  and  tolerability  of  strontium  ranelate  in  osteoporotic  men  treated  with strontium ranelate in the post-marketing setting. The non-interventional survey is planned for 3-years and  would  include  3000  men  with  primary  osteoporosis,  according  to  sample  size  calculations.  The MAH assumes that approximately 162 fractures  would  be  observed  during  the  3-year  follow  up.  At entry  in  the  trial,  the  necessary  information  to  calculate  a  10-year  fracture  risk  using  FRAX  (Kanis 2008)  will  be  recorded.  This  proposal  is  supported  and  it  is  considered  that  such  an  observational survey  could  indeed  yield  meaningful  information  on  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  strontium  ranelate treatment of male osteoporosis in clinical use.

Moreover, due to the safety concerns addressed above, the new indication in men and the lack of longterm safety data in this population, the MAH should continue to submit 6 monthly PSURs instead of yearly PSURs, unless otherwise notified by the CHMP.

In  summary,  BMD  in  lumbar  spine  (primary  efficacy  parameter)  as  well  as  secondary  efficacy parameters total hip BMD and femoral neck BMD were significantly better after 12 months treatment with strontium ranelate, as compared to placebo. Further, results are comparable with those previously demonstrated in a female postmenopausal osteoporosis population.

Taking into account all the evidence provided in this application and considering also the updated RMP including  the  proposed  post-marketing  studies,  it  is  concluded  that  the  benefit-risk  balance  of strontium  ranelate  in  the  applied  indication  'treatment  of  osteoporosis  in  men  at  increased  risk  of fractures' is positive.

4. Recommendations Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore  recommends  the  variation  to  the  terms  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation,  concerning  the following changes: Extension  of  indication  to  include  'treatment  of  osteoporosis  in  men  at  increased  risk  of  fracture'. Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.6, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, upon request by the CHMP, Annex II has been updated to reflect  the  fact  that  the  MAH  should  provide  6-monthly  PSURs  unless  otherwise  specified  by  the Committee. The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet. Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation Risk management system and PSUR cycle The MAH will continue to submit 6-monthly PSURs, unless otherwise specified by the CHMP.
