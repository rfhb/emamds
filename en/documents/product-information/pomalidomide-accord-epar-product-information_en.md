| Muscle weakness ≥ Grade 2                            | Interrupt dose until muscle weakness ≤ Grade 1. Resume at one dose level lower than previous dose.                                |
| Hyperglycaemia ≥ Grade 3                             | Decrease dose by one dose level. Treat with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents as needed.                                       |
| Acute pancreatitis                                   | Discontinue dexamethasone from treatment regimen.                                                                                 |
| Other ≥ Grade 3 dexamethasone-related adverse events | Stop dexamethasone dosing until the adverse event resolves to ≤ Grade 2. Resume at one dose level lower than previous dose.       |

If recovery from toxicities  is prolonged  beyond 14 days, then the dose of dexamethasone will  be resumed at one dose level lower than the previous dose.

Dexamethasone should be discontinued  if the patient is unable to tolerate 8 mg if ≤ 75 years old or 4 mg if &gt; 75 years old.

In case of permanent discontinuation  of any component of the treatment regimen, continuation  of the remaining  medicinal  products is at the physician's  discretion.

## Pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone

The recommended starting dose of pomalidomide  is 4 mg taken orally  once daily  on Days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle.

The recommended dose of dexamethasone is 40 mg taken orally once daily  on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle.

Treatment with pomalidomide  combined  with dexamethasone should be given until  disease progression or until  unacceptable toxicity  occurs.

## Pomalidomide dose modification or interruption

Instructions for dose interruptions  or reductions for pomalidomide  related adverse reactions are outlined  in Table 2 and 3.

## Dexamethasone dose modification or interruption

Instructions for dose modification  for dexamethasone related adverse reactions are outlined  in Table 4. Instructions for dose reduction for dexamethasone related adverse reactions are outlined  in Table 6 below. However, dose interruption  / resumption decisions  are at physician's discretion per the current Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).

Dexamethasone should be discontinued  if the patient is unable to tolerate 10 mg if ≤ 75 years old or 8 mg if &gt; 75 years old.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required for pomalidomide.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone

For patients &gt;75 years of age, the starting dose of dexamethasone is:

-  For Cycles 1 to 8: 10 mg once daily  on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12 of each 21-day cycle
-  For Cycles 9 and onwards: 10 mg once daily  on Days 1, 2, 8 and 9 of each 21-day cycle.

## Pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone

For patients &gt; 75 years of age, the starting dose of dexamethasone is:

-  20 mg once daily  on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle.

## Hepatic impairment

Patients with serum total bilirubin  &gt; 1.5 x ULN (upper limit  of normal  range) were excluded from clinical  studies. Hepatic impairment  has a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide (see section 5.2). No adjustment of the starting dose of pomalidomide  is required for patients with hepatic impairment  as defined by the Child-Pugh  criteria. However, patients with hepatic impairment should  be carefully monitored  for adverse reactions and dose reduction  or interruption  of pomalidomide  should  be used as needed.

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment of pomalidomide  is required for patients with renal impairment.  On haemodialysis days, patients should take their pomalidomide  dose following  haemodialysis.

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of pomalidomide  in children  aged 0-17 years for the indication  of multiple myeloma.

Outside its authorised indications,  pomalidomide  has been studied in  children aged 4 to 18 years with recurrent or progressive brain tumours, however the results of studies did  not allow to conclude that the benefits of such use outweigh  the risks. Currently available  data are described in  sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2.

## Method of administration

## Oral use.

Pomalidomide  Accord hard capsules should  be taken orally  at the same time each day. The capsules should  not be opened, broken or chewed (see section 6.6). The capsules should  be swallowed whole, preferably with water, with or without  food. If the patient  forgets to take a dose of pomalidomide  on one day, then the patient should take the normal prescribed dose as scheduled on the next day. Patients should  not adjust the dose to make up for a missing  dose on previous days.

It is recommended to press only  on one end of the capsule to remove it from the blister thereby reducing the risk of capsule deformation or breakage.

## 4.3 Contraindications

-  Pregnancy.
-  Women of childbearing  potential, unless all the conditions  of the pregnancy prevention programme are met (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).
-  Male patients unable to follow  or comply with the required contraceptive measures (see section 4.4).
-  Hypersensitivity  to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Teratogenicity

Pomalidomide  must not be taken during pregnancy, since a teratogenic effect is expected. Pomalidomide  is structurally related to thalidomide.  Thalidomide  is a known human teratogen that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. Pomalidomide was found to be teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when administered during the period of major organogenesis (see section 5.3).

The conditions  of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme must be fulfilled  for all patients unless there is reliable evidence that the patient does not have childbearing  potential.

## Criteria for women of non-childbearing  potential

A female patient or a female partner of a male patient is considered of non-childbearing  potential if she meets at least one of the following  criteria:

-  Age ≥ 50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for ≥ 1 year (amenorrhoea following  cancer therapy or during  breast-feeding does not rule out childbearing  potential)
-  Premature ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist gynaecologist
-  Previous bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy,  or hysterectomy
-  XY genotype, Turner syndrome, uterine agenesis.

## Counselling

For women of childbearing  potential,  pomalidomide  is contraindicated unless all of the following  are met:

-  She understands the expected teratogenic risk to the unborn child
-  She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption,  at least 4 weeks before starting treatment, throughout the entire duration of treatment, and at least 4 weeks after the end of treatment
-  Even if a woman of childbearing  potential  has amenorrhoea she must follow all the advice on effective contraception
-  She should  be capable of complying  with effective contraceptive measures
-  She is informed and understands the potential  consequences of pregnancy and the need to rapidly consult if there is a risk of pregnancy
-  She understands the need to commence the treatment as soon as pomalidomide  is dispensed following  a negative pregnancy test
-  She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing at least every 4 weeks except in case of confirmed tubal sterilisation
-  She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated with the use of pomalidomide.

The prescriber must ensure that for women of childbearing  potential:

-  The patient complies with the conditions  of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme, including confirmation  that she has an adequate level of understanding
-  The patient has acknowledged the aforementioned conditions.

For male patients taking pomalidomide,  pharmacokinetic data has demonstrated that pomalidomide  is present in human semen during treatment. As a precaution, and taking into account special populations with potentially  prolonged  elimination  time such as hepatic impairment,  all male patients taking pomalidomide  must meet the following  conditions:

-  He understands the expected teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity  with a pregnant woman or a woman of childbearing  potential
-  He understands the need for the use of a condom if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

woman or a woman of childbearing  potential not using effective contraception, throughout treatment duration, during dose interruption  and for 7 days after dose interruptions and/or cessation of treatment. This includes vasectomised males who should wear a condom if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman or a woman of childbearing  potential  as seminal fluid  may still contain pomalidomide  in the absence of spermatozoa.

-  He understands that if his female partner becomes pregnant whilst he is taking pomalidomide  or 7 days after he has stopped taking pomalidomide,  he should inform his treating physician immediately  and that it is recommended to refer the female partner to a physician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice.

## Contraception

Women of childbearing  potential must use at least one effective method of contraception for at least 4 weeks before therapy, during therapy, and until  at least 4 weeks after pomalidomide  therapy and even in case of dose interruption unless the patient commits to absolute and continuous abstinence confirmed on a monthly  basis. If not established on effective contraception, the patient must be referred to an appropriately trained health care professional for contraceptive advice in order that contraception can be initiated.

The following  can be considered to be examples of suitable methods of contraception:

-  Implant
-  Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system
-  Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot
-  Tubal sterilisation
-  Sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only; vasectomy must be confirmed by two negative semen analyses
-  Ovulation  inhibitory  progesterone-only pills  (i.e. desogestrel)

Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism  in patients with multiple  myeloma taking pomalidomide  and dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pills  are not recommended (see also section 4.5). If a patient is currently using  combined oral contraception the patient should switch to one of the effective methods listed above. The risk of venous thromboembolism  continues for 4-6 weeks after discontinuing  combined oral contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced during cotreatment with dexamethasone (see section 4.5).

Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk of infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding.  Prophylactic antibiotics  should be considered particularly  in patients with neutropenia.

Insertion of copper-releasing intrauterine devices is not recommended due to the potential risks of infection at the time of insertion and menstrual blood  loss which may compromise patients with severe neutropenia or severe thrombocytopenia.

## Pregnancy testing

According to local practice, medically  supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum  sensitivity  of 25 mIU/mL must be performed for women of childbearing  potential as outlined  below. This requirement includes women of childbearing  potential  who practice absolute and continuous abstinence. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing  a prescription and dispensing  should occur on the same day. Dispensing of pomalidomide  to women of childbearing  potential should occur within  7 days of the prescription.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Prior to starting treatment

A medically  supervised pregnancy test should be performed during  the consultation,  when pomalidomide  is prescribed, or in the 3 days prior to the visit  to the prescriber once the patient had been using effective contraception for at least 4 weeks. The test should ensure the patient is not pregnant when she starts treatment with pomalidomide.

## Follow-up and end of treatment

A medically  supervised pregnancy test should be repeated at least every 4 weeks, including  at least 4 weeks after the end of treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal sterilisation.  These pregnancy tests should be performed on the day of the prescribing visit  or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber.

## Additional  precautions

Patients should be instructed never to give this medicinal  product to another person and to return any unused capsules to their pharmacist at the end of treatment.

Patients should not donate blood,  semen or sperm during  treatment (including  during  dose interruptions) and for at least 7 days following  discontinuation  of pomalidomide.

Healthcare professionals and caregivers should wear disposable gloves when handling  the blister or capsule. Women who are pregnant or suspect they may be pregnant should not handle the blister or capsule (see section 6.6)

## Educational materials, prescribing and dispensing  restrictions

In order to assist patients in avoiding  foetal exposure to pomalidomide,  the Marketing Authorisation Holder will  provide educational material to healthcare professionals to reinforce the warnings about the expected teratogenicity of pomalidomide,  to provide advice on contraception before treatment is started, and to provide guidance on the need for pregnancy testing. The prescriber must inform the patient about the expected teratogenic risk and the strict pregnancy prevention measures as specified in the Pregnancy Prevention Programme and provide patients with appropriate patient educational brochure, patient card and/or equivalent tool as agreed with each National Competent Authority. In collaboration  with each National Competent Authority,  a controlled access programme has been implemented which includes the use of a patient card and/or equivalent tool  for prescribing and /or dispensing  controls, and the collection  of information  relating to the indication  in order to monitor  the off-label use within the national territory. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing  a prescription and dispensing should  occur on the same day. Dispensing of pomalidomide  to women of childbearing  potential should  occur within 7 days of the prescription and following  a medically supervised negative pregnancy test result. Prescriptions for women of childbearing  potential can be for a maximum duration of treatment of 4 weeks according to the approved indications  dosing regimens (see section 4.2), and prescriptions for all other patients can be for a maximum  duration of 12 weeks.

## Haematological events

Neutropenia was the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 haematological adverse reaction in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple  myeloma, followed by anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Patients should be monitored for haematological  adverse reactions, especially neutropenia. Patients should be advised to report febrile episodes promptly.  Physicians should  observe patients for signs of bleeding including  epistaxes, especially with use of concomitant medicinal  products known to increase the risk of bleeding (see section 4.8). Complete blood  counts should  be monitored at baseline, weekly for the first 8 weeks and monthly thereafter. A dose modification may be required (see section 4.2). Patients may require use of blood  product support and /or growth factors.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Thromboembolic  events

Patients receiving pomalidomide  either in combination  with bortezomib  and dexamethasone or in combination  with dexamethasone have developed venous thromboembolic  events (predominantly deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary  embolism)  and arterial thrombotic events (myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident) (see section 4.8). Patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism  including  prior thrombosis - should  be closely monitored. Action should be taken to try to minimise  all modifiable  risk factors (e.g. smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia).  Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism.  Patients should be instructed to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, arm or leg swelling. Anti-coagulation  therapy (unless contraindicated) is recommended, (such as acetylsalicylic acid, warfarin, heparin or clopidogrel),  especially in patients with additional  thrombotic risk factors. A decision to take prophylactic measures should be made after a careful assessment of the individual patient's underlying  risk factors. In clinical  studies, patients received prophylactic acetylsalicylic  acid or alternative anti-thrombotic  therapy. The use of erythropoietic agents carries a risk of thrombotic  events including  thromboembolism.  Therefore, erythropoietic agents, as well as other agents that may increase the risk of thromboembolic  events, should  be used with caution.

## Thyroid disorders

Cases of hypothyroidism  have been reported. Optimal control of co-morbid conditions  influencing thyroid  function is recommended before start of treatment. Baseline and ongoing  monitoring  of thyroid function is recommended.

## Peripheral neuropathy

Patients with ongoing  ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy were excluded from clinical  studies with pomalidomide.  Appropriate caution should  be exercised when considering the treatment of such patients with pomalidomide.

## Significant  cardiac dysfunction

Patients with significant  cardiac dysfunction (congestive heart failure [NY Heart Association Class III or IV]; myocardial infarction within  12 months of starting study; unstable or poorly  controlled angina pectoris) were excluded from clinical  studies with pomalidomide.  Cardiac events, including  congestive cardiac failure, pulmonary oedema and atrial fibrillation  (see section 4.8), have been reported, mainly  in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease or cardiac risk factors. Appropriate caution should  be exercised when considering the treatment of such patients with pomalidomide,  including  periodic monitoring  for signs or symptoms of cardiac events.

## Tumour lysis  syndrome

Patients at greatest risk of tumour lysis syndrome are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions taken.

## Second primary malignancies

Second primary malignancies,  such as non-melanoma skin cancer, have been reported in patients receiving pomalidomide  (see section 4.8). Physicians should carefully evaluate patients before and during  treatment using standard cancer screening for occurrence of second primary malignancies  and institute treatment as indicated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Allergic reactions and severe skin reactions

Angioedema, anaphylactic reaction and severe dermatologic reactions including  SJS, TEN and DRESS have been reported with the use of pomalidomide  (see section 4.8). Patients should  be advised of the signs and symptoms of these reactions by their prescribers and should  be told  to seek medical attention immediately  if they develop these symptoms. Pomalidomide  must be discontinued  for exfoliative  or bullous  rash, or if SJS, TEN or DRESS is suspected, and should not be resumed following discontinuation  for these reactions. Patients with a prior history  of serious allergic  reactions associated with thalidomide  or lenalidomide  were excluded from clinical  studies. Such patients may be at higher risk of hypersensitivity  reactions and should  not receive pomalidomide.  Pomalidomide  interruption  or discontinuation  should  be considered for Grade 2-3 skin rash. Pomalidomide  must be discontinued permanently for angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.

## Dizziness  and confusion

Dizziness  and confusional  state have been reported with pomalidomide.  Patients must avoid situations where dizziness  or confusion may be a problem  and not to take other medicinal  products that may cause dizziness  or confusion without  first seeking medical  advice.

## Interstitial  lung  disease (ILD)

ILD and related events, including  cases of pneumonitis,  have been observed with pomalidomide. Careful assessment of patients with an acute onset or unexplained  worsening of pulmonary  symptoms should  be performed to exclude ILD. Pomalidomide  should be interrupted pending  investigation  of these symptoms and if ILD is confirmed,  appropriate treatment should  be initiated.  Pomalidomide should  only  be resumed after a thorough  evaluation  of the benefits and the risks.

## Hepatic disorders

Markedly elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin  have been observed in  patients treated with pomalidomide  (see section 4.8). There have also been cases of hepatitis that resulted in discontinuation  of pomalidomide.  Regular monitoring  of liver  function is recommended for the first 6 months of treatment with pomalidomide  and as clinically  indicated  thereafter.

## Infections

Reactivation of hepatitis B has been reported rarely in patients receiving pomalidomide  in combination with dexamethasone who have previously  been infected with the hepatitis  B virus (HBV). Some of these cases have progressed to acute hepatic failure, resulting  in  discontinuation  of pomalidomide. Hepatitis B virus status should  be established before initiating  treatment with pomalidomide.  For patients who test positive  for HBV infection,  consultation  with a physician  with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. Caution should  be exercised when pomalidomide  in combination  with dexamethasone is used in patients previously  infected with HBV, including  patients who are anti-HBc positive  but HBsAg negative. These patients should  be closely monitored  for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection  throughout  therapy.

## Progressive multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML)

Cases of progressive multifocal  leukoencephalopathy,  including  fatal cases, have been reported with pomalidomide.  PML was reported several months to several years after starting the treatment with pomalidomide.  Cases have generally been reported in patients taking concomitant dexamethasone or prior treatment with other immunosuppressive  chemotherapy. Physicians should  monitor  patients at regular intervals and should  consider PML in the differential  diagnosis  in patients with new or worsening neurological  symptoms, cognitive  or behavioural  signs or symptoms. Patients should  also be advised to inform  their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the patient is not aware of.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The evaluation  for PML should  be based on neurological  examination,  magnetic resonance imaging  of the brain, and cerebrospinal fluid  analysis for JC virus (JCV) DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or a brain biopsy  with testing for JCV. A negative JCV PCR does not exclude PML. Additional follow-up  and evaluation  may be warranted if no alternative diagnosis  can be established.

If PML is suspected, further dosing  must be suspended until  PML has been excluded. If PML is confirmed,  pomalidomide  must be permanently discontinued.

## Sodium  content

This medicinal  product contains less than 1 mmol  sodium  (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially  'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Effect of pomalidomide  on other medicinal  products

Pomalidomide  is not anticipated to cause clinically  relevant pharmacokinetic interactions due to P450 isoenzyme inhibition  or induction  or transporter inhibition  when co-administered  with substrates of these enzymes or transporters. The potential  for such interactions,  including  the potential  impact of pomalidomide  on the pharmacokinetics  of combined  oral contraceptives, has not been evaluated clinically  (see section 4.4 Teratogenicity).

## Effect of other medicinal  products on pomalidomide

Pomalidomide  is partly metabolised by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4/5. It is also a substrate for Pglycoprotein.  Co-administration  of pomalidomide  with the strong CYP3A4/5 and P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole,  or the strong CYP3A4/5 inducer carbamazepine, had no clinically  relevant effect on exposure to pomalidomide.  Co-administration  of the strong CYP1A2 inhibitor  fluvoxamine  with pomalidomide  in  the presence of ketoconazole,  increased mean exposure to pomalidomide  by 107% with a 90% confidence interval [91% to 124%] compared to pomalidomide  plus  ketoconazole. In a second study to evaluate the contribution  of a CYP1A2 inhibitor  alone to metabolism  changes, coadministration  of fluvoxamine  alone with pomalidomide  increased mean exposure to pomalidomide  by 125% with a 90% confidence interval  [98% to 157%] compared to pomalidomide  alone. If strong inhibitors  of CYP1A2 (e.g. ciprofloxacin,  enoxacin and fluvoxamine)  are co-administered with pomalidomide,  reduce the dose of pomalidomide  by 50%.

## Dexamethasone

Co-administration  of multiple  doses of up to 4 mg pomalidomide  with 20 mg to 40 mg dexamethasone (a weak to moderate inducer of several CYP enzymes including  CYP3A) to patients with multiple myeloma had no effect on the pharmacokinetics  of pomalidomide  compared with pomalidomide administered alone.

The effect of dexamethasone on warfarin is unknown. Close monitoring  of warfarin concentration is advised during  treatment.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing  potential  / Contraception in males and females

Women of childbearing  potential  should  use effective method of contraception. If pregnancy occurs in a woman treated with pomalidomide,  treatment must be stopped and the patient should be referred to a physician  specialised or experienced in teratology  for evaluation  and advice. If pregnancy occurs in a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

partner of a male patient taking pomalidomide,  it is recommended to refer the female partner to a physician  specialised or experienced in teratology  for evaluation  and advice. Pomalidomide  is present in human semen. As a precaution, all male patients taking pomalidomide  should use condoms throughout  treatment duration,  during  dose interruption  and for 7 days after cessation of treatment if their partner is pregnant or of childbearing  potential  and has no contraception (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

## Pregnancy

A teratogenic effect of pomalidomide  in  humans is expected. Pomalidomide  is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing  potential,  except when all the conditions  for pregnancy prevention have been met (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether pomalidomide  is excreted in human milk.  Pomalidomide  was detected in milk of lactating rats following  administration  to the mother. Because of the potential  for adverse reactions in breastfed infants from pomalidomide,  a decision must be made whether to discontinue  breastfeeding or to discontinue  the medicinal  product, taking  into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child  and the benefit of the therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

Pomalidomide  was found to impact negatively  on fertility  and be teratogenic in animals. Pomalidomide  crossed the placenta and was detected in foetal blood  following  administration  to pregnant rabbits, see section 5.3.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Pomalidomide  has minor  or moderate influence on the ability  to drive and use machines. Fatigue, depressed level of consciousness, confusion, and dizziness  have been reported with the use of pomalidomide.  If affected, patients should be instructed not to drive cars, use machines or perform hazardous tasks while being treated with pomalidomide.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

## Pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone

The most commonly  reported Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were blood and lymphatic  system disorders including  neutropenia (47.1%), thrombocytopenia  (28.1%) and anaemia (15.1%). The most commonly  reported serious adverse reaction was pneumonia (12.2%). Other serious adverse reactions reported included  pyrexia (4.3%), lower respiratory tract infection (3.6%), influenza  (3.6%), pulmonary  embolism  (3.2%), atrial fibrillation  (3.2%), and acute kidney injury  (2.9%).

## Pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone

The most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical  studies have been blood  and lymphatic system disorders including  anaemia (45.7%), neutropenia (45.3%) and thrombocytopenia  (27%); in general disorders and administration  site conditions  including  fatigue (28.3%), pyrexia (21%) and oedema peripheral (13%); and in infections and infestations  including  pneumonia (10.7%). Peripheral neuropathy adverse reactions were reported in 12.3% of patients and venous embolic  or thrombotic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(VTE) adverse reactions were reported in 3.3% of patients. The most commonly  reported Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were in the blood  and lymphatic  system disorders including  neutropenia (41.7%), anaemia (27%) and thrombocytopenia  (20.7%); in infections and infestations including  pneumonia (9%); and in general disorders and administration  site conditions  including  fatigue (4.7%), pyrexia (3%) and oedema peripheral (1.3%). The most commonly  reported serious adverse reaction was pneumonia  (9.3%). Other serious adverse reactions reported included  febrile neutropenia (4.0%), neutropenia (2.0%), thrombocytopenia  (1.7%) and VTE adverse reactions (1.7 %).

Adverse reactions tended to occur more frequently within  the first 2 cycles of treatment with pomalidomide.

## Tabulated list  of adverse reactions

The adverse reactions observed in patients treated with pomalidomide  in combination  with bortezomib and dexamethasone, pomalidomide  in combination  with dexamethasone and from post-marketing surveillance  are listed in Table 7 by system organ class (SOC) and frequency for all adverse reactions and for Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions.

Frequencies are defined in accordance with current guidance, as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10) and uncommon  (≥1/1,000  to &lt;1/100) and not known (frequency cannot be determined).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

The frequencies in this section are from clinical  studies in  patients receiving  pomalidomide  treatment in combination  either with bortezomib  and dexamethasone (Pom+Btz+Dex) or with dexamethasone (Pom+Dex).

## Teratogenicity

Pomalidomide  is structurally related to thalidomide.  Thalidomide  is a known human teratogenic active substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. Pomalidomide  was found to be teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when administered during  the period of major  organogenesis (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). If pomalidomide  is taken during  pregnancy, a teratogenic effect of pomalidomide  in humans is expected (see section 4.4).

## Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia

Neutropenia occurred in up to 54.0% (Pom+Btz+Dex) patients (47.1% (Pom+Btz+Dex) Grade 3 or 4). Neutropenia led to pomalidomide  discontinuation  in  0.7% of any patients and was infrequently serious.

Febrile neutropenia (FN) was reported in 3.2% (Pom+Btz+Dex) patients and 6.7% (Pom+Dex) patients and was serious in 1.8% (Pom+Btz+Dex) patients and 4.0% (Pom+Dex) patients (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

Thrombocytopenia  occurred in 39.9% (Pom+Btz+Dex) patients and 27.0% (Pom+Dex) patients. Thrombocytopenia  was Grade 3 or 4 in 28.1% (Pom+Btz+Dex) patients and 20.7% (Pom+Dex) patients, led to pomalidomide  discontinuation  in 0.7% (Pom+Btz+Dex) patients and 0.7% (Pom+Dex) patients, and was serious in 0.7% (Pom+Btz+Dex) and 1.7% (Pom+Dex) patients (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia  tended to occur more frequently within  the first 2 cycles of treatment with pomalidomide  in combination  either with bortezomib  and dexamethasone or with dexamethasone

## Infection

Infection was the most common non haematological  toxicity.

Infection occurred in 83.1% (Pom+Btz+Dex) patients and 55.0% (Pom+Dex) patients (34.9% (Pom+Btz+Dex) and 24.0% (Pom+Dex) Grade 3 or 4). Upper respiratory tract infection and pneumonia  were the most frequently occurring infections. Fatal infections (Grade 5) occurred in 4.0% (Pom+Btz+Dex) patients and 2.7% (Pom+Dex) patients. Infections led to pomalidomide discontinuation  in 3.6% (Pom+Btz+Dex) patients and 2.0% (Pom+Dex) patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Thromboembolic events

Prophylaxis  with acetylsalicylic  acid (and other anticoagulants in high-risk  patients) was mandatory for all patients in  clinical  studies. Anticoagulation  therapy (unless contraindicated) is recommended (see section 4.4).

Venous thromboembolic  events (VTE) occurred in 12.2% (Pom+Btz+Dex) and 3.3% (Pom+Dex) patients (5.8 % (Pom+Btz+Dex) and 1.3% (Pom+Dex) Grade 3 or 4). VTE was reported as serious in 4.7% (Pom+Btz+Dex) and 1.7% (Pom+Dex) patients, no fatal reactions were reported, and VTE was associated with pomalidomide  discontinuation  in up to 2.2% (Pom+Btz+Dex) of patients.

Peripheral neuropathy - Pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone Patients with ongoing  peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 2 with pain within  14 days prior  to randomisation  were excluded from clinical  trials. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 55.4 % of patients (10.8% Grade 3; 0.7% Grade 4). Exposure-adjusted rates were comparable across treatment arms. Approximately  30% of the patients experiencing peripheral neuropathy had a history  of neuropathy at baseline. Peripheral neuropathy led to discontinuation  of bortezomib  in approximately  14.4% of patients, pomalidomide  in 1.8% and dexamethasone in 1.8% of patients in the Pom+Btz+Dex arm and 8.9% of patients in  the Btz+Dex arm.

## Peripheral neuropathy - Pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone

Patients with ongoing  peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 2 were excluded from clinical  studies. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 12.3% of patients (1.0% Grade 3 or 4). No peripheral neuropathy reactions were reported as serious, and peripheral  neuropathy led to dose discontinuation  in 0.3% of patients (see section 4.4).

## Haemorrhage

Haemorrhagic disorders have been reported with pomalidomide,  especially  in patients with risk factors such as concomitant medicinal  products that increase susceptibility  to bleeding.  Haemorrhagic events have included  epistaxis, intracranial  haemorrhage and gastrointestinal  haemorrhage.

## Allergic reactions and severe skin reactions

Angioedema, anaphylactic reaction and severe cutaneous reactions including  SJS, TEN and DRESS have been reported with the use of pomalidomide.  Patients with a history of severe rash associated with lenalidomide  or thalidomide  should not receive pomalidomide  (see section 4.4).

## Paediatric population

Adverse reactions reported in paediatric patients (aged 4 to 18 years) with recurrent or progressive brain tumours were consistent with the known pomalidomide  safety profile in adult patients (see section 5.1).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation  of the medicinal  product is important. It allows continued  monitoring  of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal  product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national  reporting  system listed in  Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Pomalidomide  doses as high as 50 mg as a single  dose in healthy volunteers have been studied without reporting serious adverse reactions related to overdose. Doses as high as 10 mg once-daily multiple doses in multiple  myeloma patients have been studied without  reported serious adverse reactions related to overdose. The dose-limiting  toxicity  was myelosuppression.  In studies, pomalidomide  was found to be removed by haemodialysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the event of overdose, supportive  care is advised.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group:  Immunosuppressants, Other immunosuppressants,  ATC code: L04AX06

## Mechanism of action

Pomalidomide  has direct anti-myeloma  tumoricidal  activity,  immunomodulatory  activities and inhibits stromal cell support for multiple  myeloma tumour cell growth. Specifically,  pomalidomide  inhibits proliferation  and induces apoptosis of haematopoietic  tumour cells. Additionally,  pomalidomide inhibits  the proliferation  of lenalidomide-resistant  multiple  myeloma cell lines and synergises with dexamethasone in both lenalidomide-sensitive  and lenalidomide-resistant  cell lines  to induce tumour cell apoptosis. Pomalidomide  enhances T cell- and natural killer  (NK) cell-mediated immunity  and inhibits  production  of pro-inflammatory  cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) by monocytes. Pomalidomide  also inhibits  angiogenesis  by blocking  the migration  and adhesion of endothelial  cells.

Pomalidomide  binds  directly to the protein cereblon (CRBN), which is part of an E3 ligase complex that includes deoxyribonucleic  acid (DNA) damage-binding  protein 1(DDB1), cullin  4 (CUL4), and regulator of cullins-1  (Roc1), and can inhibit  the auto-ubiquitination  of CRBN within  the complex. E3 ubiquitin  ligases are responsible for the poly-ubiquitination  of a variety of substrate proteins,  and may partially  explain the pleiotropic  cellular  effects observed with pomalidomide  treatment.

In the presence of pomalidomide  in vitro,  substrate proteins Aiolos  and Ikaros are targeted for ubiquitination  and subsequent degradation leading  to direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory  effects. In vivo,  pomalidomide  therapy led to reduction in the levels of Ikaros in patients with relapsed lenalidomide-refractory  multiple  myeloma.

## Clinical  efficacy and safety

## Pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone

The efficacy and safety of pomalidomide  in combination  with bortezomib  and low-dose dexamethasone (Pom+Btz+LD-Dex) was compared with bortezomib  and low-dose dexamethasone (Btz+LD-Dex) in a Phase III multi-centre,  randomised, open-label  study (CC-4047-MM-007),  in previously  treated adult patients with multiple  myeloma,  who had received at least one prior regimen, including  lenalidomide  and have demonstrated disease progression on or after the last therapy. A total of 559 patients were enrolled and randomised in the study:  281 in the Pom+Btz+LD-Dex arm and 278 in the Btz+LD-Dex arm. 54% of patients were male with median age for the overall  population  of 68 years (min,  max: 27, 89 years). Approximately  70% of patients were refractory to lenalidomide (71.2% in  Pom+Btz+LD-Dex, 68.7 % in Btz+LD-Dex). Approximately  40% of patients were in 1st relapse and approximately  73% of patients received bortezomib  as prior treatment.

Patients in the Pom+Btz+LD-Dex arm were administered 4 mg pomalidomide  orally  on Days 1 to 14 of each 21-day cycle. Bortezomib  (1.3 mg/m 2 /dose) was administered to patients in both study arms on Days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 21-day cycle for Cycles 1 to 8; and on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle for Cycles 9 and onwards. Low-dose dexamethasone (20 mg/day [≤ 75 years old] or 10 mg/day [&gt; 75 years old]) was administered to patients in both study arms on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12 of a 21day cycle for Cycles 1 to 8; and on Days 1, 2, 8 and 9 of each subsequent 21-day cycle from Cycles 9 onwards. Doses were reduced and treatment was temporarily interrupted or stopped as needed to manage toxicity  (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary  efficacy endpoint  was Progression Free Survival  (PFS) assessed by an Independent Response Adjudication  Committee (IRAC) according to the IMWG criteria using the intent to treat population  (ITT). After a median follow-up  of 15.9 months, median PFS time was 11.20 months (95% CI: 9.66, 13.73) in the Pom+Btz+LD-Dex arm. In the Btz+LD-Dex arm, median PFS time was 7.1 months (95% CI: 5.88, 8.48).

Summary of overall efficacy data are presented in Table 8 using a cut-off date of 26 Oct 2017. KaplanMeier curve for PFS for the ITT population  is provided in  Figure 1.

The median duration  of treatment was 8.8 months (12 treatment cycles) in the Pom+Btz+LD-Dex arm and 4.9 months (7 treatment cycles) in the Btz+LD-Dex arm.

The PFS advantage was more pronounced in patients who received only one prior  line of therapy.

Data cutoff: 26 Oct 2017

Final  analysis for Overall Survival  (OS), using  a cut-off of 13 May 2022 (median follow-up  period of 64.5 months),  median OS time from Kaplan-Meier estimates was 35.6 months for the Pom + Btz + LD-Dex arm and 31.6 months for the Btz + LD-Dex arm; HR =0.94, 95% CI: -0.77, 1.15, with an overall event rate of 70.0%. The OS analysis was not adjusted to account for subsequent therapies received.

## Pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone

The efficacy and safety of pomalidomide  in combination  with dexamethasone were evaluated in a Phase III multi-centre, randomised,  open-label  study (CC-4047-MM-003),  where pomalidomide  plus low-dose dexamethasone therapy (Pom+LD-Dex) was compared to high-dose dexamethasone alone (HD-Dex) in previously  treated adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple  myeloma,  who have received at least two prior treatment regimens,  including  both lenalidomide  and bortezomib,  and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. A total of 455 patients were enrolled in the study:  302 in the Pom+LD-Dex arm and 153 in the HD-Dex arm. The majority  of patients were male (59%) and white (79%); the median age for the overall population  was 64 years (min,  max: 35, 87 years).

Patients in the Pom+LD-Dex arm were administered 4 mg pomalidomide  orally on days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle. LD-Dex (40 mg) was administered once per day on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 28day cycle. For the HD-Dex arm, dexamethasone (40 mg) was administered once per day on days 1 through 4, 9 through 12, and 17 through 20 of a 28-day cycle. Patients &gt; 75 years of age started treatment with 20 mg dexamethasone. Treatment continued until  patients had disease progression.

The primary  efficacy endpoint  was progression free survival  by International  Myeloma Working Group (IMWG criteria). For the intention  to treat (ITT) population,  median PFS time by Independent Review Adjudication  Committee (IRAC) review based on IMWG criteria was 15.7 weeks (95% CI: 13.0, 20.1) in the Pom + LD-Dex arm; the estimated 26-week event-free survival rate was 35.99% (±3.46%). In the HD-Dex arm, median PFS time was 8.0 weeks (95% CI: 7.0, 9.0); the estimated 26week event-free survival rate was 12.15% (±3.63%).

PFS was evaluated in several relevant subgroups:  gender, race, ECOG performance status, stratification  factors (age, disease population,  prior anti-myeloma  therapies [2, &gt; 2]), selected parameters of prognostic  significance (baseline beta-2 microglobulin  level,  baseline albumin  levels, baseline renal impairment,  and cytogenetic risk), and exposure and refractoriness to prior anti-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

myeloma therapies. Regardless of the subgroup evaluated, PFS was generally consistent with that observed in the ITT population  for both treatment groups.

PFS is summarised in Table 9 for the ITT population.  Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS for the ITT population  is provided  in Figure 2.

Overall Survival  was the key secondary study endpoint. A total of 226 (74.8%) of the Pom + LD-Dex patients and 95 (62.1%) of the HD-Dex patients were alive as of the cutoff date (07 Sep 2012). Median OS time from Kaplan-Meier estimates has not been reached for the Pom + LD-Dex, but would  be expected to be at least 48 weeks, which is the lower boundary of the 95% CI. Median OS time for the HD-Dex arm was 34 weeks (95% CI: 23.4, 39.9). The 1-year event free rate was 52.6% (± 5.72%) for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the Pom + LD-Dex arm and 28.4% (± 7.51%) for the HD-Dex arm. The difference in OS between the two treatment arms was statistically  significant  (p &lt; 0.001).

Overall survival  is summarised in Table 10 for the ITT population.  Kaplan-Meier curve for OS for the ITT population  is provided  in Figure 3.

Based on the results of both PFS and OS endpoints,  the Data Monitoring  Committee established for this study recommended that the study be completed and patients in the HD-Dex arm be crossed over to the Pom + LD-Dex arm.

## Paediatric population

In a Phase 1 single-arm,  open-label,  dose escalation study, the maximum  tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase2 dose (RP2D) of pomalidomide  in paediatric patients was determined to be 2.6 mg/m 2 /day administered orally  on Day 1 to Day 21 of a repeated 28-day cycle.

Efficacy was not demonstrated in a Phase 2 multi-centre,  open-label,  parallel-group  study conducted in 52 pomalidomide-treated  paediatric patients, aged 4 to 18 years with recurrent or progressive high-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

grade glioma,  medulloblastoma,  ependymoma or diffuse intrinsic  pontine glioma  (DIPG) with primary location  in the central nervous system (CNS).

In the Phase 2 study,  two patients in the high-grade glioma  group (N=19) achieved a response as defined by protocol;  one of these patients achieved a partial response (PR) and the other patient achieved a long  term stable disease (SD), which resulted in an objective  response (OR) and long-term SD rate of 10.5% (95% CI: 1.3, 33.1). One patient in the ependymoma group (N=9) achieved a longterm SD which resulted in an OR and long-term  SD rate of 11.1% (95% CI: 0.3, 48.2). No confirmed OR or long-term SD was observed in any of the evaluable patients in either the diffuse intrinsic pontine  glioma  (DIPG) group (N=9) or medulloblastoma  group (N=9). None of the 4 parallel  groups assessed in this Phase 2 study met the primary endpoint  of objective response or long-term  stable disease rate.

The overall  safety profile of pomalidomide  in paediatric patients was consistent with the known safety profile  in adults. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in an Integrated PK Analysis of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies and were found to have no significant  difference to those observed in adult patients (see section 5.2).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Pomalidomide  is absorbed with a maximum  plasma concentration (Cmax) occurring between 2 and 3 hours and is at least 73% absorbed following  administration  of single oral  dose. The systemic exposure (AUC) of pomalidomide  increases in an approximately  linear and dose proportional  manner. Following  multiple  doses, pomalidomide  has an accumulation ratio of 27 to 31% on AUC.

Coadministration  with a high-fat  and high-calorie  meal slows the rate of absorption,  decreasing mean plasma Cmax by approximately  27%, but has minimal  effect on the overall  extent of absorption  with an 8% decrease in mean AUC. Therefore, pomalidomide  can be administered without  regard to food intake.

## Distribution

Pomalidomide  has a mean apparent volume  of distribution  (Vd/F) between 62 and 138 L at steady state. Pomalidomide  is distributed  in semen of healthy subjects at a concentration of approximately 67% of plasma level at 4 hours post-dose (approximately  Tmax) after 4 days of once daily  dosing  at 2 mg. In vitro binding  of pomalidomide  enantiomers to proteins in human plasma ranges from 12% to 44% and is not concentration dependent.

## Biotransformation

Pomalidomide  is the major circulating  component (approximately  70% of plasma radioactivity)  in vivo  in healthy subjects who received a single  oral dose of [14C]-pomalidomide  (2 mg). No metabolites were present at &gt;10% relative to parent or total radioactivity  in plasma.

The predominant  metabolic  pathways of excreted radioactivity  are hydroxylation  with subsequent glucuronidation,  or hydrolysis.  In vitro,  CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 were identified as the primary enzymes involved  in the CYP-mediated hydroxylation  of pomalidomide,  with additional  minor contributions  from CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. Pomalidomide  is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein  in vitro. Co-administration  of pomalidomide  with the strong CYP3A4/5 and P-gp inhibitor  ketoconazole, or the strong CYP3A4/5 inducer carbamazepine, had no clinically  relevant effect on exposure to pomalidomide.  Co-administration  of the strong CYP1A2 inhibitor  fluvoxamine  with pomalidomide  in the presence of ketoconazole, increased mean exposure to pomalidomide  by 107% with a 90% confidence interval  [91% to 124%] compared to pomalidomide  plus ketoconazole. In a second study to evaluate the contribution  of a CYP1A2 inhibitor  alone to metabolism  changes, co-administration  of fluvoxamine  alone with pomalidomide  increased mean exposure to pomalidomide  by 125% with a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

90% confidence interval [98% to 157%] compared to pomalidomide  alone. If strong inhibitors  of CYP1A2 (e.g. ciprofloxacin,  enoxacin and fluvoxamine)  are co-administered with pomalidomide, reduce the dose of pomalidomide  to 50%. Administration  of pomalidomide  in  smokers, with smoking tobacco known to induce the CYP1A2 isoform,  had no clinically  relevant effect on exposure to pomalidomide  compared to that exposure to pomalidomide  observed in non-smokers.

Based on in vitro data, pomalidomide  is not an inhibitor  or inducer of cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes, and does not inhibit  any drug transporters that were studied. Clinically  relevant interactions are not anticipated when pomalidomide  is coadministered  with substrates of these pathways.

## Elimination

Pomalidomide  is eliminated  with a median plasma half-life  of approximately  9.5 hours in healthy subjects and approximately  7.5 hours in patients with multiple  myeloma. Pomalidomide  has a mean total body clearance (CL/F) of approximately  7-10 L/hr.

Following  a single  oral administration  of [14C] -pomalidomide  (2 mg) to healthy subjects, approximately  73% and 15% of the radioactive dose was eliminated  in urine and faeces, respectively, with approximately  2% and 8% of the dosed radiocarbon eliminated  as pomalidomide  in urine and faeces.

Pomalidomide  is extensively metabolised  prior to excretion, with the resulting  metabolites  eliminated primarily  in the urine. The 3 predominant  metabolites in urine (formed via hydrolysis  or hydroxylation with subsequent glucuronidation)  account for approximately  23%, 17%, and 12%, respectively, of the dose in the urine.

CYP dependent metabolites account for approximately  43% of the total excreted radioactivity,  while non-CYP dependent hydrolytic  metabolites account for 25%, and excretion of unchanged pomalidomide  accounted for 10% (2% in urine and 8% in faeces).

## Population  Pharmacokinetics (PK)

Based on population  PK analysis using a two-compartment model,  healthy subjects and MM patients had comparable apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent central volume  of distribution  (V2/F). In peripheral tissues, pomalidomide  was preferentially taken up by tumours with apparent peripheral distribution  clearance (Q/F) and apparent peripheral volume  of distribution  (V3/F) 3.7-fold  and 8-fold higher,  respectively, than that of healthy subjects.

## Paediatric population

Following  a single  oral dose of pomalidomide  in children  and young adults with recurrent or progressive primary brain tumour,  the median Tmax was 2 to 4 hours post-dose and corresponded to geometric mean Cmax (CV%) values of 74.8 (59.4%), 79.2 (51.7%), and 104 (18.3%) ng/mL at the 1.9, 2.6, and 3.4 mg/m 2 dose levels,  respectively. AUC0-24 and AUC0-inf followed  similar  trends, with total exposure in the range of approximately  700 to 800 h·ng/mL at the lower 2 doses, and approximately  1200 h·ng/mL at the high  dose. Estimates of half-life  were in the range of approximately  5 to 7 hours. There were no clear trends attributable to stratification  by age and steroid use at the MTD.

Overall, data suggest that AUC increased nearly proportional  to the increase in pomalidomide  dose, while the increase in Cmax was generally less than proportional.

The pharmacokinetics  of pomalidomide  following  oral administration  dose levels of 1.9 mg/m 2 /day to 3.4 mg/m 2 /day were determined in 70 patients with ages from 4 to 20 years in an integrated analysis of a Phase 1 and Phase 2 study in recurrent or progressive paediatric brain tumours. Pomalidomide concentration-time profiles  were adequately described with a one compartment PK model with first-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

order absorption and elimination.  Pomalidomide  exhibited  linear and time-invariant  PK with moderate variability.  The typical  values of CL/F, Vc/F, Ka, lag time of pomalidomide  were 3.94 L/h, 43.0 L, 1.45 h-1 and 0.454 h respectively. The terminal elimination  half-life  of pomalidomide  was 7.33 hours. Except for body surface area (BSA), none of the tested covariates including  age and sex had effect on pomalidomide  PK. Although  BSA was identified  as a statistically  significant  covariate of pomalidomide  CL/F and Vc/F, the impact of BSA on exposure parameters was not deemed clinically relevant.

In general, there is no significant  difference of pomalidomide  PK between children and adult patients.

## Elderly

Based on population  pharmacokinetic  analyses in healthy subjects and multiple  myeloma  patients, no significant  influence of age (19-83 years) on oral clearance of pomalidomide  was observed. In clinical studies, no dose adjustment was required in elderly  (&gt; 65 years) patients exposed to pomalidomide (see section 4.2).

## Renal impairment

Population  pharmacokinetic  analyses showed that the pomalidomide  pharmacokinetic  parameters were not remarkably affected in renally impaired  patients (defined by creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular  filtration  rate [eGFR]) compared to patients with normal renal function (CrCl ≥60 mL/minute).  Mean normalised  AUC exposure to pomalidomide  was 98.2% with a 90% confidence interval  [77.4% to 120.6%] in moderate renal impairment  patients (eGFR ≥30 to ≤45 mL/minute/1.73  m 2 ) compared to patients with normal  renal function. Mean normalised  AUC exposure to pomalidomide  was 100.2% with a 90% confidence interval  [79.7% to 127.0%] in severe renal impairment  patients not requiring  dialysis  (CrCl &lt;30 or eGFR &lt;30 mL/minute/1.73  m 2 ) compared to patients with normal renal function. Mean normalised  AUC exposure to pomalidomide increased by 35.8% with a 90% CI [7.5% to 70.0%] in  severe renal impairment  patients requiring dialysis  (CrCl &lt;30mL/minute  requiring  dialysis)  compared to patients with normal renal function. The mean changes in exposure to pomalidomide  in each of these renal impairment  groups are not of a magnitude  that requires dose adjustments.

## Hepatic impairment

The pharmacokinetic  parameters were modestly changed in hepatically  impaired  patients (defined by Child-Pugh  criteria) compared to healthy subjects. Mean exposure to pomalidomide  increased by 51% with a 90% confidence interval [9% to 110%] in mildly  hepatically  impaired  patients compared to healthy subjects. Mean exposure to pomalidomide  increased by 58% with a 90% confidence interval [13% to 119%] in moderately hepatically  impaired  patients compared to healthy subjects. Mean exposure to pomalidomide  increased by 72% with a 90% confidence interval [24% to 138%] in severely hepatically  impaired patients compared to healthy subjects. The mean increases in exposure to pomalidomide  in each of these impairment  groups are not of a magnitude for which adjustments in schedule or dose are required (see section 4.2).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Repeat-dose toxicology  studies

In rats, chronic administration  of pomalidomide  at doses of 50, 250,  and 1000  mg/kg/day for 6 months was well tolerated. No adverse findings  were noted up to 1000 mg/kg/day (175-fold  exposure ratio relative to a 4 mg clinical  dose).

In monkeys, pomalidomide  was evaluated in repeat-dose studies of up to 9 months in duration. In these studies, monkeys exhibited  greater sensitivity  to pomalidomide  effects than rats. The primary toxicities  observed in monkeys were associated with the haematopoietic/lymphoreticular  systems. In

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the 9-month study in  monkeys with doses of 0.05, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg/day,  morbidity  and early euthanasia of 6 animals  were observed at the dose of 1 mg/kg/day and were attributed to immunosuppressive  effects (staphylococcal infection,  decreased peripheral blood  lymphocytes, chronic inflammation  of the large intestine,  histologic  lymphoid  depletion,  and hypocellularity  of bone marrow) at high  exposures of pomalidomide  (15-fold  exposure ratio relative to a 4 mg clinical  dose). These immunosuppressive  effects resulted in early euthanasia of 4 monkeys due to poor health condition  (watery stool, inappetence, reduced food intake, and weight loss); histopathologic  evaluation of these animals showed chronic inflammation  of the large intestine  and villous  atrophy of the small intestine. Staphylococcal infection  was observed in 4 monkeys; 3 of these animals responded to antibiotic  treatment and 1 died without treatment. In addition,  findings  consistent with acute myelogenous  leukemia led to euthanasia of 1 monkey; clinical  observations and clinical  pathology and/or bone marrow alterations observed in this animal  were consistent with immunosuppression. Minimal  or mild  bile duct proliferation  with associated increases in ALP and GGT were also observed at 1 mg/kg/day. Evaluation  of recovery animals  indicated that all treatment-related findings  were reversible after 8 weeks of dosing  cessation, except for proliferation  of intrahepatic bile ducts observed in 1 animal  in the 1 mg/kg/day  group. The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.5-fold  exposure ratio relative to a 4 mg clinical  dose).

## Genotoxicity/carcinogenicity

Pomalidomide  was not mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian  mutation  assays, and did not induce chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral blood  lymphocytes  or micronuclei  formation in polychromatic  erythrocytes in bone marrow of rats administered doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day. Carcinogenicity  studies have not been conducted.

## Fertility  and early embryonic development

In a fertility  and early embryonic development study in rats, pomalidomide  was administered to males and females at doses of 25, 250, and 1000 mg/kg/day. Uterine examination  on Gestation Day 13 showed a decrease in mean number of viable embryos and an increase in postimplantation  loss at all dose levels. Therefore, the NOAEL for these observed effects was &lt; 25 mg/kg/day (AUC 24h was 39960 ng·h/mL  (nanogram·hour/millilitres)  at this lowest dose tested, and the exposure ratio was 99fold relative to a 4 mg clinical  dose). When treated males on this study were mated with untreated females, all uterine parameters were comparable to the controls. Based on these results, the observed effects were attributed to the treatment of females.

## Embryo-foetal development

Pomalidomide  was found to be teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when administered during  the period of major organogenesis. In the rat embryofoetal developmental  toxicity  study, malformations  of absence of urinary bladder, absence of thyroid  gland,  and fusion  and misalignment  of lumbar and thoracic vertebral elements (central and/or neural arches) were observed at all dose levels (25, 250,  and 1000 mg/kg/day).

There was no maternal toxicity  observed in this study. Therefore, the maternal NOAEL was 1000 mg/kg/day,  and the NOAEL for developmental  toxicity  was &lt; 25 mg/kg/day (AUC24h was 34340 ng·h/mL  on Gestation Day 17 at this lowest dose tested, and the exposure ratio was 85-fold relative to a 4 mg clinical  dose). In rabbits, pomalidomide  at doses ranging  from 10 to 250 mg/kg produced embryo-foetal developmental  malformations.  Increased cardiac anomalies were seen at all doses with significant  increases at 250 mg/kg/day. At 100 and 250 mg/kg/day,  there were slight increases in post-implantation  loss and slight  decreases in fetal body weights. At 250 mg/kg/day,  fetal malformations  included  limb  anomalies (flexed and/or rotated fore- and/or hindlimbs,  unattached or absent digit)  and associated skeletal malformations  (not ossified  metacarpal, misaligned  phalanx and metacarpal, absent digit,  not ossified phalanx,  and short not ossified or bent tibia);  moderate dilation  of the lateral ventricle in the brain; abnormal  placement of the right subclavian  artery; absent intermediate lobe in the lungs; low-set kidney;  altered liver  morphology;  incompletely  or not ossified

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pelvis;  an increased average for supernumerary thoracic ribs and a reduced average for ossified tarsals. Slight  reduction in maternal body weight gain, significant  reduction in triglycerides,  and significant decrease in absolute and relative spleen weights were observed at 100 and 250 mg/kg/day. The maternal NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day,  and the developmental  NOAEL was &lt;10 mg/kg/day  (AUC24h was 418 ng·h/mL on Gestation Day 19 at this lowest dose tested, which was similar  to that obtained from a 4 mg clinical  dose).

## 1. What Pomalidomide Accord is and what it is used for

## What Pomalidomide Accord is

Pomalidomide  Accord contains the active substance 'pomalidomide'.  This medicine  is related to thalidomide  and belongs to a group of medicines which affect the immune system (the body's natural defences).

## What Pomalidomide Accord is used for

Pomalidomide  Accord is used to treat adults with a type of cancer called 'multiple  myeloma'.

## Pomalidomide  Accord is either used with:

-  two other medicines - called 'bortezomib'  (a type of chemotherapy medicine)  and 'dexamethasone' (an anti-inflammatory  medicine) in people who have had at least one other treatment - including  lenalidomide.

Or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  one other medicine - called 'dexamethasone' in people whose myeloma has become worse, despite having  at least two other treatments - including  lenalidomide  and bortezomib.

## What is multiple myeloma

Multiple  myeloma is a type of cancer which affects a certain type of white blood  cell (called the 'plasma cell'). These cells grow out of control and accumulate in the bone marrow. This results in damage to the bones and kidneys.

Multiple  myeloma generally  cannot be cured. However, treatment can reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease, or make them disappear for a period  of time. When this happens, it is called 'response'.

## How Pomalidomide Accord works

Pomalidomide  Accord works in a number of different ways:

-  by stopping  the myeloma cells developing
-  by stimulating  the immune system to attack the cancer cells
-  by stopping  the formation  of blood  vessels supplying  the cancer cells.

## The benefit of using Pomalidomide  Accord with bortezomib  and dexamethasone

When Pomalidomide  Accord is used with bortezomib  and dexamethasone, in people who have had at least one other treatment, it can stop multiple  myeloma getting worse:

-  On average, Pomalidomide  Accord when used with bortezomib  and dexamethasone stopped multiple  myeloma from coming  back for up to 11 months - compared with 7 months for those patients who only  used bortezomib  and dexamethasone.

## The benefit of using Pomalidomide  Accord with dexamethasone

When Pomalidomide  Accord is used with dexamethasone, in people who have had at least two other treatments, it can stop multiple  myeloma getting  worse:

-  On average, Pomalidomide  Accord when used with dexamethasone stopped multiple  myeloma from coming  back for up to 4 months - compared with 2 months for those patients who used only dexamethasone.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Pomalidomide Accord

## Do not take Pomalidomide Accord:

-  if you are pregnant or think  you may be pregnant or are planning  to become pregnant - this is because Pomalidomide  Accord is expected to be harmful to an unborn child.  (Men and women taking this medicine  must read the section 'Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding information  for women and men' below).
-  if you are able to become pregnant, unless you follow  all the necessary measures to prevent you from becoming  pregnant (see 'Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding - information  for women and men'). If you are able to become pregnant, your doctor will  record with each prescription  that the necessary measures have been taken and will  provide you with this confirmation.
-  if you are allergic  to pomalidomide  or any of the other ingredients  of this medicine (listed  in section 6). If you think  you may be allergic,  ask your doctor for advice.

If you are uncertain whether any of the conditions  above apply to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking  Pomalidomide  Accord.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Pomalidomide  Accord if:

-  you have ever had blood  clots in the past. During the treatment with  Pomalidomide  Accord you have an increased risk of getting blood  clots in  your veins and arteries. Your doctor may recommend you take additional  treatments (e.g. warfarin) or lower the dose of Pomalidomide Accord to reduce the chance that you get blood  clots.
-  you have ever had an allergic  reaction such as rash, itching,  swelling,  feeling  dizzy  or trouble breathing while taking  related medicines called 'thalidomide'  or 'lenalidomide'.
-  you have had a heart attack, have heart failure, have difficulty  breathing,  or if you  smoke, have high  blood  pressure or high  cholesterol levels.
-  you have a high  total amount of tumour throughout  the body,  including  your bone marrow. This could lead to a condition  where the tumours break down and cause unusual levels of chemicals in the blood  which can lead to kidney  failure. You may also experience an uneven heartbeat. This condition  is called tumour lysis  syndrome.
-  you have or have had neuropathy (nerve damage causing tingling  or pain in your hands or feet).
-  you have or have ever had hepatitis B infection. Treatment with Pomalidomide  Accord may cause the hepatitis B virus to become active again in patients who carry the virus, resulting  in a recurrence of the infection.  Your doctor should check whether you have ever had hepatitis B infection.
-  you experience or have experienced in the past a combination  of any of the following  symptoms: rash on face or extended rash, red skin,  high  fever, flu-like  symptoms,  enlarged lymph  nodes (signs of severe skin reaction called Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia  and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) or drug hypersensitivity  syndrome, Toxic Epidermal  Necrolysis (TEN) or StevensJohnson Syndrome (SJS). See also section 4 'Possible side effects').

It is important  to note that patients with multiple  myeloma treated with pomalidomide  may develop additional  types of cancer, therefore your doctor should  carefully evaluate the benefit and risk when you are prescribed this medicine.

At any time during  or after your treatment, tell your doctor or nurse immediately  if  you:  experience blurred,  loss of or double  vision,  difficulty  speaking,  weakness in an arm or a leg, a change in the way you walk or problems with your balance, persistent numbness, decreased sensation or loss of sensation, memory loss or confusion. These may all be symptoms of a serious and potentially  fatal brain condition  known as progressive multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML). If you had these symptoms prior to treatment with Pomalidomide  Accord, tell your doctor about any change in these symptoms.

At the end of the treatment you should  return all unused capsules to the pharmacist.

## Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding - information for women and men

The following  must  be followed  as stated in the  Pomalidomide  Accord Pregnancy  Prevention Programme.  Women and men taking  Pomalidomide  Accord must not become pregnant or father a child.  This is because pomalidomide  is expected to harm the unborn baby. You and your partner should  use effective methods of contraception while taking this medicine.

## Women

Do not take Pomalidomide  Accord if you are pregnant, think  you may be pregnant or are planning  to become pregnant. This is because this medicine  is expected to harm the unborn  baby. Before starting the treatment, you should  tell your doctor if you are able to become pregnant, even if you think  this is unlikely.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are able to become pregnant:

-  you must use effective methods of contraception for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment, for the whole time you are taking treatment, and until  at least 4 weeks after stopping  treatment. Talk to your doctor about the best method of contraception for you.
-  each time your doctor writes a prescription for you,  he will  ensure you understand the necessary measures that have to be taken to prevent pregnancy.
-  your doctor will  arrange pregnancy tests before treatment, at least every 4 weeks during  treatment, and at least 4 weeks after the treatment has finished.

If you become pregnant despite the prevention  measures:

-  you must stop the treatment immediately  and talk to your doctor straight away.

## Breast-feeding

It is not known if Pomalidomide  Accord passes into human breast milk.  Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or intend  to breast-feed. Your doctor will  advise if you should  stop or continue breastfeeding.
