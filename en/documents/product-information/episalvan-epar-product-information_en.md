No dose adjustment or special considerations are anticipated for patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). No dose adjustment is required. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Elderly

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Episalvan in children and adolescents under 18 years have not yet been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

For cutaneous application.

Fresh wounds should achieve haemostasis prior to application of Episalvan. If necessary, wounds (accidental wounds) should be cleaned according to standard procedure, using e.g. wound antiseptic solution, prior to application of Episalvan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Episalvan is for single use only.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to the excipient listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Wound infection

Episalvan gel is sterile. However, wound infection is an important and serious complication that can occur during wound healing. In the case of infection, it is recommended to discontinue treatment with Episalvan. Additional standard treatment may be required (see section 4.5). Wound size The mean wound size treated with Episalvan in clinical studies in split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds was 40.7 cm² (range 8-300 cm²). In the Grade 2a burn wound study, the mean wound size treated with Episalvan was 108 cm² (range 23-395 cm²). Duration of use There is no information available on clinical use of Episalvan for more than 4 weeks. Partial thickness burn wounds Repeated critical assessment of burn depth and healing progression is needed. Wounds that are assessed as unable to heal within an acceptable time frame may need surgical measures (e.g., splitthickness skin grafting) to reduce the risk of hypertrophic scarring. Other wound types There is no clinical experience from the use of Episalvan for the treatment of chronic wounds, e.g. diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers or wounds in patients with epidermolysis bullosa. Birch pollen allergy Episalvan is safe to use for people who are allergic to birch pollen, as these allergens are not present in Episalvan. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Medicinal product no longer authorised

No interaction studies have been performed. Since the systemic exposure of Episalvan following cutaneous application is negligible no interaction with systemic treatments is expected. Interactions with topical products have not been investigated in clinical trials. Other topical products should not be concomitantly used together with Episalvan but rather sequentially or alternatively depending on the clinical need.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

No studies in pregnant women have been conducted.

No effects during pregnancy are anticipated, since systemic exposure to Episalvan is negligible. Episalvan can be used during pregnancy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

No data are available to evaluate whether Episalvan is excreted into human milk.

No effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breastfeeding woman to Episalvan is negligible. Episalvan can be used during breast-feeding, unless the chest area is subject to treatment.

## Fertility

Fertility studies have not been conducted. No effects on human fertility are anticipated, since the systemic exposure is negligible. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Episalvan has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The most frequently observed adverse reactions were wound complication (in 2.9% of patients), pain of skin (2.5%) and pruritus (1.3%). Adverse reactions were administration site reactions only. Wound complication adverse reactions such as wound infection and wound necrosis are complications of healing of partial thickness skin wounds and can be serious (see section 4.4). Tabulated list of adverse reactions In the following table, adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common ( ≥ 1/10); common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Overdosing with Episalvan is unlikely: in patients in which wound sizes &gt;300 cm 2 were repeatedly treated with Episalvan, no betulin plasma levels could be detected.

<!-- image -->

The Phase III studies were blindly evaluated, prospective, intra-individually controlled, randomised, multicentre trials. The target wound area of each patient was divided into two treatment areas of approximately the same size; the treatment allocation to the two halves of the wound (distal vs. proximal) was determined by randomisation (in the burn trial, two similar wounds could be used). Episalvan plus wound dressing was applied to half of the wound area, and the same kind of nonadhesive wound dressing alone was applied to the other half as the control in the split-thickness skin graft donor site studies. In the Grade 2a burn wound study an octenidine containing antiseptic wound gel and fatty gauze dressing were used as control. Application was at each wound dressing change every third to fourth day until full wound closure up to 28 days for the split-thickness skin graft trials, and every other day up to 21 days for the Grade 2a burn trial. Photographs of the wound were taken at each visit for the blinded evaluation.

No data have been generated to study the effect of accidental ingestion of Episalvan. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Preparation for treatment of wounds and ulcers; ATC code: D03AX13. Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects The active substance accelerated re-epithelialization in an in vitro wound scratch assay using human primary keratinocytes at the dosage of 1 μg/ml, and in a porcine ex vivo wound healing model at the dosage of 10 µg/ml. The precise mechanism of action of the active substance in wound healing in humans is not known. Clinical efficacy and safety Three Phase III studies were conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of Episalvan in the treatment of partial thickness wounds of the skin: two studies which investigated split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds, which included a total of 219 patients (ITT: N=217), and one further study in 61 patients with Grade 2a burn wounds (ITT: N=57). Patients with deeper burn wounds (Grade 2b) were not included. The 219 patients with split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds had a mean age of 53 years; their donor site mean wound size was 81.5 cm 2 . In the burn wound study with 61 patients, the mean study wound area was 216 cm 2 ; the total burn injury of these patients was larger and affected 5.8% of the total body surface area. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The primary endpoint for the two split-thickness skin graft trials was the intra-individual difference in time to wound closure (at least 95% epithelialisation) based on blinded photo evaluations. Median time to wound healing was 14 days. Wound halves treated with Episalvan healed faster than the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

wound halves treated with standard of care (mean 1.1 days according to primary endpoints, p&lt;0.0001, two-sided paired t-test).

Paediatric population

<!-- image -->

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Episalvan in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of skin injuries (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

a Based on 2-sided paired t-test Intention-to-treat (ITT) data set. 'Primary' vs. 'secondary' blinded read: In the primary blinded read evaluation a rigorous quality check was implemented to assure blinding of the observers. In consequence a substantial number of photographs were excluded and not presented in the primary blinded read because of apparent gel residues. The secondary blinded read was conducted with all photographs presented to the blinded observers. 'Very conservative calculation' means that the first observation of wound closure was taken as time of wound closure. Difference in time to wound closure was set to 0 for photo series rated as 'not evaluable'. If wound closure was not observed in a wound half photo series, it was calculated to have occurred one day after the last photograph in the series. 'Less conservative calculation' differs from the 'very conservative calculation' in one aspect: If wound closure was not observed in a wound half photo series, it was calculated to have occurred not one day, but approximately 3 days later (the mean time interval between wound dressing changes in the studies). CI: 95% confidence interval; MTWDC: mean time to wound dressing change; N: number of patients in the analysis set; STSG Split-thickness skin graft The primary endpoint for the Grade 2a burn wound trial was the percentage of patients with earlier healing (at least 95% epithelialisation) based on blinded photo evaluations. Median time to wound healing was 7.3 days. Of the patients with a between-treatment difference in wound healing (N=35), the percentage of patients who showed earlier healing (primary endpoint) of their Episalvan treated wound half (85.7% [95% CI: 69.7%, 95.2%]) was higher than those who showed earlier healing of their standard of care control treated wound half (14.3% [95% CI: 4.8%, 30.3%]) (p&lt;0.0001, binomial test). In follow-up visits at 3 months and 12 months after the day of surgery or of burn injury the treated wound halves were found to be equal in the majority of patients with regard to pigmentation, redness, texture and hair growth of the regenerated epidermis. For a subset of patients blinded photo-evaluation indicated better results for Episalvan treated wound halves compared to standard of care in pigmentation, redness and texture of the former wound areas.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Episalvan gel is administered topically to skin wounds and shows poor absorption. Based on data from three clinical studies with a total of 280 patients, application of Episalvan gel to open wounds did not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lead to betulin plasma levels higher than natural background-levels originating e.g. from nutritional sources.

Since no biologically relevant levels of betulin were found in patients, no further studies related to distribution, biotransformation and elimination were performed.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, and phototoxicity. Repeated dose toxicity and local tolerance have been studied for up to 4 weeks. Toxicity studies of longer duration than 4 weeks have not been performed. The active substance was not genotoxic in in vitro assays.

No special requirements.

Carcinogenicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been performed. 6.

Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor or nurse before using Episalvan. Episalvan does not contain birch pollen, so it may be used by people with birch pollen allergy. Wound infection is a serious complication that can occur during the healing process. Possible signs of a wound infection are that the wound begins to drain yellow or greenish fluid (pus), or that the skin around the wound becomes red, warm, swollen, or increasingly painful. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Children and adolescents

Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because there is insufficient experience of the use of Episalvan in these patients.

## Other medicines and Episalvan

If you have an infection in the wound additional treatment may be required.

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No studies have been performed to establish whether Episalvan will interact with other medicines. However, since the amount of Episalvan absorbed into the body is extremely low it is not expected that Episalvan will interact with other medicines.

No data are available on possible interaction between Episalvan and other medicines applied to the skin. Do not apply other products to the skin wound area at the same time of applying Episalvan.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

No studies have been done on the effects of Episalvan on pregnant women, but since the absorption of this medicine into the body is extremely low, the risk to the unborn baby is negligible. Episalvan can be used during pregnancy.

It is not known whether Episalvan passes into human breast milk, but since the absorption of this medicine into the body is minimal, the risk to the baby is negligible. Episalvan can be used during breast-feeding, unless the chest area is being treated. The effect of Episalvan on fertility has not been studied, but since the absorption of this medicine into the body is extremely low, it is not expected to have an effect on your fertility. Driving and using machines Your ability to drive and use machines will not be affected by this medicine. 3. How to use Episalvan Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or nurse has told you. Check with your doctor or nurse if you are not sure. Method of administration -If necessary, wounds should be cleansed using a suitable antiseptic solution prior to application of Episalvan -Episalvan should be applied to the wound surface at a thickness of approximately 1 mm and covered by a sterile wound dressing. -Re-apply the gel each time the dressing is changed, until the wound is healed. Duration of use Your doctor or nurse will tell you for how long you should use the gel. Episalvan should be used until the wound is healed or up to 4 weeks. There is no experience from long-term use of Episalvan for more than 4 weeks. If you use more Episalvan than you should Episalvan is applied to the skin and the absorption into the body is minimal. This makes overdose very unlikely, even if applied to large skin areas and for a long period of time. If you forget to use Episalvan Medicinal product no longer authorised

Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Apply Episalvan at the next planned change of the wound dressing, continuing with your normal routine.

## If you stop using Episalvan

Episalvan should be used as advised by your doctor or nurse. Do not stop using it without consulting your doctor or nurse. If your wound shows no signs of improvement over time, talk to your doctor or nurse.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

## ANNEX IV GROUNDS FOR ONE ADDITIONAL RENEWAL Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Grounds for one additional renewal

Based upon the data that have become available since the granting of the initial Marketing authorisation, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance of Episalvan remains positive, but considers that its safety profile is limited for the following reasons:

For Episalvan limited safety information is available because of limited exposure due to limited marketing of the medicinal product. As of the DLP, Episalvan has been placed on the market in only one EU country.

Episalvan has not yet been commercially launched or placed on the market in any other EU country and thus, no post-authorisation data are currently available. Furthermore, no data on post-authorisation use in special populations were reported as no non-interventional studies, including market research and registries, have been conducted with Episalvan since the granting of the marketing authorisation.

<!-- image -->

Therefore, based upon the limited safety profile of Episalvan, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional renewal application in 5 years time. Medicinal product no longer authorised
