## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for sacubitril / valsartan, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

## Psychiatric disorders

In view of available data on psychosis and psychotic disorders from the literature, spontaneous reports including in multiple cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between sacubitril/valsartan and hallucinations, sleep disorder and paranoia are at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC Rapporteur concluded that the product information of products containing sacubitril/valsartan should be amended accordingly.

Update of section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC to add hallucinations, sleep disorder and paranoia with a frequency 'rare' for hallucinations and sleep disorder and frequency 'very rare' for paranoia. The package leaflet is updated accordingly.

## Tablet splitting

In view of available data on 'tablet splitting' from the literature and spontaneous reports including the following risk of dose modification (underdose/overdose), changes in pharmacokinetics and potentially gastrointestinal tract disturbances, the PRAC Rapporteur considers that the product information of products containing sacubitril/valsartan should be amended accordingly.

Update of section 4.2 of the SmPC to add information on correct use of the medicine, with a recommendation not to split/cut/crush the tablet. The package leaflet is updated accordingly.

## Lithium drug-drug interaction and toxicity

In view of available data on lithium drug-drug interaction and toxicity from spontaneous reports including in one case a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between sacubitril/valsartan and lithium drug-drug interaction and toxicity is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC Rapporteur concluded that the product information of products containing sacubitril/valsartan should be amended accordingly.

Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC to amend the lithium drug-drug interaction and toxicity. No updates to the package leaflet are considered warranted. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for sacubitril / valsartan the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing sacubitril / valsartan is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
