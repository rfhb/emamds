Medicinal product no longer authorised 3 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology -Prevention of hepatitis B in case of accidental exposure in non-immunised subjects: At least 500 IU, depending on the intensity of exposure, as soon as possible after exposure, and preferably within 24 - 72 hours. -Immunoprophylaxis of hepatitis B in haemodialysed patients: 8-12 IU/kg with a maximum of 500 IU, every 2 months until seroconversion following vaccination. -Prevention of hepatitis B in the newborn, of a hepatitis B virus carrier-mother, at birth or as soon as possible after birth: 30-100 IU/kg. The hepatitis B immunoglobulin administration may need to be repeated until seroconversion following vaccination. In all these situations, vaccination against hepatitis B virus is highly recommended. The first vaccine dose can be injected the same day as human hepatitis B immunoglobulin, however in different sites. In subjects who did not show an immune response (no measurable hepatitis B antibodies) after vaccination, and for whom continuous prevention is necessary, administration of 500 IU to adults and 8 IU/kg to children every 2 months can be considered; a minimum protective antibody titre is considered to be 10 mIU/ml. Consideration should also be given to dose and dose schedules for human hepatitis B immunoglobulin for intramuscular use recommended in other official guidance. Method of administration ImmunoGam should be administered via the intramuscular route. If a large volume (&gt;2 ml for children or &gt;5 ml for adults) is required, it is recommended to administer this in divided doses at different sites. When simultaneous vaccination is necessary, the immunoglobulin and the vaccine should be administered at two different sites. If intramuscular administration is contraindicated (bleeding disorders), the injection can be administered subcutaneously if no intravenous medicinal product is available. However, it should be noted that there are no clinical efficacy data to support administration by the subcutaneous route. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to any of the components. Hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulins, especially in very rare cases of IgA deficiency when the patient has antibodies against IgA.

Medicinal product no longer authorised 4 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Ensure that ImmunoGam is not administered into a blood vessel, because of the risk of shock. If the recipient is a carrier of HBsAg, there is no benefit in administering this medicinal product. True hypersensitivity reactions are rare. ImmunoGam contains a small quantity of IgA (less than 40 micrograms/ml). Individuals who are deficient in IgA have the potential for developing IgA antibodies and may have anaphylactic reactions after administration of blood components containing IgA. The physician must therefore weigh the benefit of treatment with ImmunoGam against potential risk of hypersensitivity reactions. Rarely, human hepatitis B immunoglobulin can induce a fall in blood pressure with anaphylactic reaction, even in patients who have tolerated previous treatment with immunoglobulin. Suspicion of allergic or anaphylactic type reactions requires immediate discontinuation of the injection. In case of shock, standard medical treatments for shock should be implemented. Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations, and plasma pools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV, and HCV. The measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as HAV and parvovirus B19. There is reassuring clinical experience regarding the lack of hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 transmission with immunoglobulins and it is also assumed that the antibody content makes an important contribution to the viral safety. It is strongly recommended that every time ImmunoGam is administered to a patient, the name and batch number of the medicinal product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of medicinal product. ImmunoGam contains 0.16 g of maltose in a 500 IU dose. This should be taken into account in patients with diabetes mellitus. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Live attenuated virus vaccines Immunoglobulin administration may interfere with the development of an immune response to live attenuated virus vaccines such as rubella, mumps, measles and varicella for a period of 3 months. After administration of this medicinal product, an interval of at least 3 months should elapse before vaccination with live attenuated virus vaccines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Medicinal product no longer authorised 5 Human hepatitis B immunoglobulin should be administrated three to four weeks after vaccination with such a live attenuated vaccine; in case administration of human hepatitis B immunoglobulin is essential within three to four weeks after vaccination, then revaccination should be performed three months after the administration of human hepatitis B immunoglobulin. Interference with testing Serological testing After injection of immunoglobulin the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in the patient's blood may result in misleading positive results in serological testing. Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens, e.g. A, B, D may interfere with some serological tests for red cell allo-antibodies (e.g.Coombs' test). Blood glucose testing Some types of blood glucose testing systems (for example, those based on the glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinolinequinone (GDH-PQQ) or glucose-dye-oxidoreductase methods) falsely interpret the maltose contained in ImmunoGam as glucose. This may result in falsely elevated glucose readings and consequently in the inappropriate administration of insulin, resulting in life-threatening hypoglycemia. Also, cases of true hypoglycemia may go untreated if the hypoglycemic state is masked by falsely elevated glucose readings. Accordingly, when administering ImmunoGam or other parenteral maltose-containing products, the measurement of blood glucose must be done with a glucose-specific method. The product information of the blood glucose testing systems, including that of the test strips, should be carefully reviewed to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose-containing parenteral products. If any uncertainty exists, the manufacturer of the testing system should be contacted to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose-containing parenteral products. 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy The safety of this medicinal product for use in human pregnancy has not been established in controlled clinical trials. Clinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on the course of pregnancy, or on the fetus and the neonate are to be expected. Lactation Immunoglobulins are excreted into milk but no harmful effects on the neonate are to be expected. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No effects on ability to drive and use machines have been observed.

You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. -If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor. In this leaflet : 1. What ImmunoGam is and what it is used for 2. Before you receive ImmunoGam 3. How ImmunoGam is administered 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store ImmunoGam 6. Further information 1. WHAT IMMUNOGAM IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR What ImmunoGam is ImmunoGam belongs to a group of medicines containing immunoglobulins (antibodies which can protect against certain infections), which are present in your blood. ImmunoGam contains increased levels of human hepatitis B immunoglobulins mainly immunoglobulin G (IgG) and is obtained from blood plasma of screened donors from the USA. What ImmunoGam is used for ImmunoGam provides protection against hepatitis B virus for a short period of time and it is used to treat the following: -Accidental exposure in non-immunised subjects (including persons whose vaccination is incomplete or status unknown). -Haemodialysed patients, until vaccination has become effective. -Newborn of a hepatitis B virus carrier-mother. -Subjects who did not show an immune response (no measurable hepatitis B antibodies) after vaccination and for whom a continuous prevention is necessary due to the continuous risk of being infected with hepatitis B. 2. BEFORE YOU RECEIVE IMMUNOGAM You should NOT be given ImmunoGam -if you have previously developed an allergic reaction to human immunoglobulins, to other blood products or to any of the other ingredients of ImmunoGam. -if you have an IgA deficiency such that you have developed an allergic reaction to IgA containing products

Medicinal product no longer authorised 18 Take special care with ImmunoGam General warnings related to ImmunoGam:  Immunoglobulins in general may cause adverse reactions such as chills, headache, fever, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, arthralgia (joint pain), low blood pressure and moderate low back pain.  Patients should be monitored for antibodies against human hepatitis B immunoglobulin regularly.  Human hepatitis B immunoglobulin injections can induce a drop in blood pressure with an allergic reaction, even in patients who have tolerated previous treatments with immunoglobulin. Suspicion of allergic or anaphylactic type reactions requires immediate discontinuation of the injection. In case of shock, standard medical treatments for shock should be administered.  Immunoglobulin A: Please tell your doctor if your blood does not have immunoglobulin A (IgA). ImmunoGam contains small amounts of IgA. Patients who have an IgA deficiency may develop an allergic reaction to this medicine.  ImmunoGam contains maltose (10%w/w). Serological Testing ImmunoGam may cause a rise of various transferred antibodies which may result in misleading positive results of certain blood serum tests. Also transmission of antibodies to blood group antigens may interfere with some blood tests for red cell allo-antibodies (e.g. Coombs' test). Blood Glucose Testing Blood glucose testing: when administering ImmunoGam, the measurement of blood glucose must be done with a glucose-specific method. This is because Some types of blood glucose testing systems falsely interpret the maltose contained in ImmunoGam as glucose. This may result in falsely elevated glucose readings and consequently in the inappropriate administration of insulin which may result in hypoglycemia. Also cases of true hypoglycemia may go untreated if the hypoglycemic state is masked by falsely elevated glucose readings.' Viral Safety When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent infections being passed from blood donors on to patients. These include careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections. Manufacturers of these products also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections. The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. The measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19. Immunoglobulins have not been associated with hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 infections possibly because the antibodies against these infections, which are contained in the product, are protective. It is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of ImmunoGam, the name and batch number of the product are recorded in your physician's notes in order to maintain a record of the batches used.

HOW IMMUNOGAM IS ADMINISTERED The quantity of ImmunoGam you will need will be determined by your doctor or nurse. The table below provides a recommended dose. Vaccination against hepatitis B virus is highly recommended. The first vaccine dose can be injected on the same day as human hepatitis B immunoglobulin, however in different sites. Instructions for Use ImmunoGam should be brought to room temperature (approximately 20°C to 25°C ) before use. The solution should be clear to slightly opalescent and colourless or pale yellow essentially free of foreign particles. Do not use solutions that are cloudy or have deposits. For intramuscular administration, ImmunoGam should be injected into the upper part of the shoulder (deltoid muscle), or into the right part of the thigh in the front (anteriolateral thigh) in newborn children. If a large volume (greater than 2 ml for children or greater than 5 ml for adults) is required, it is recommended that the administration of ImmunoGam be divided doses at different sites. When simultaneous vaccination is necessary, the immunoglobulin and the vaccine should be administered at two different sites.

Medicinal product no longer authorised 22 This leaflet was last approved in Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: http://www.ema.europa.eu The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only: Posology -Prevention of hepatitis B in case of accidental exposure in non-immunised subjects: At least 500 IU, depending on the intensity of exposure, as soon as possible after exposure, and preferably within 24 - 72 hours. -Immunoprophylaxis of hepatitis B in haemodialysed patients: 8-12 IU/kg with a maximum of 500 IU, every 2 months until seroconversion following vaccination. -Prevention of hepatitis B in the newborn, of a hepatitis B virus carrier-mother, at birth or as soon as possible after birth: 30-100 IU/kg. The hepatitis B immunoglobulin administration may need to be repeated until seroconversion following vaccination. In all these situations, vaccination against hepatitis B virus is highly recommended. The first vaccine dose can be injected the same day as human hepatitis B immunoglobulin, however in different sites. In subjects who did not show an immune response (no measurable hepatitis B antibodies) after vaccination, and for whom continuous prevention is necessary, administration of 500 IU to adults and 8 IU/kg to children every 2 months can be considered; a minimum protective antibody titre is considered to be 10 mIU/ml. Consideration should also be given to dose and dose schedules for human hepatitis B immunoglobulin for intramuscular use recommended in other official guidance. Method of Administration ImmunoGam should be administered via the intramuscular route. If a large volume (&gt;2 ml for children or &gt;5 ml for adults) is required, it is recommended to administer this in divided doses at different sites. When simultaneous vaccination is necessary, the immunoglobulin and the vaccine should be administered at two different sites. Instruction for Use and Handling and Disposal ImmunoGam should be brought to room temperature (approximately 20°C to 25°C) before use The solution should be clear to slightly opalescent and colourless or pale yellow. Do not use solutions that are cloudy or have deposits. Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
