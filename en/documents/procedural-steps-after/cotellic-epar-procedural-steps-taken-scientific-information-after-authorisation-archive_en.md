2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| II/0025 | Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC based on final results from study GO29665 (iMATRIX_cobimetinib) which corresponds to Study 4 of PIP P/0119/2021. This is a phase I/II, multicentre, open-label, dose-escalation study of the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of cobimetinib in paediatric and young adult patients with previously treated solid tumours. The section 2 of the Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

The safety of Cotellic was assessed in a multi-centre, open-label, dose-escalation study in 55 paediatric patients aged 2 to 17 years with solid tumours. The safety profile of Cotellic in these patients was consistent with that in the adult population. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC, but no recommendation on posology can be made.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 23/06/2016   | 24/05/2017 | SmPC | At the initial Marketing Authorisation Application, the overall survival data from the pivotal phase III Study GO28141 ('coBRIM') were immature. In the present variation, an update of overall survival and safety was provided for Study GO28141, and updated efficacy analyses were provided for the supportive phase 1b Study NO25395 ('BRIM7'). The SmPC has been updated with the updated efficacy results from both studies. The survival benefit of the addition of cobimetinib to vemurafenib in the treatment of unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma has now been established to be approximately 5 months in median. Small changes in the cumulative frequencies of adverse drug reactions were observed in the Study GO28141 safety update with 10 month's increased median follow-up. No changes were made to the SmPC with regard to safety. The |

| II/0001/G | This was an application for a group of variations. Update of sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2 of the SmPC to reflect the results GP29342 with recommendations for patients with hepatic impairment. Furthermore, the MAH submitted results of the in vitro CYP time- dependent inhibition study (15-1983). In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to use the term CYP3A throughout the SmPC to cover both CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, in line with previous recommendations, and to bring the product in line with the latest QRD template. The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. The Risk Management Plan was updated to reflect the completion of the studies. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | 28/04/2016 | 01/06/2016 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | The pharmacokinetics and safety of Cotellic (cobimetinib) in subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects was evaluated with study GP29342. Systemic total cobimetinib exposures after a single dose were similar in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects, while subjects with severe hepatic impairment had lower total cobimetinib exposures (AUC0- ∞ geometric mean ratio of 0.69 compared to healthy subjects) which is not considered to be clinically significant. Unbound cobimetinib exposures were similar between subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function while subjects with severe hepatic impairment had approximately 2-fold higher exposures. No dose adjustment is therefore recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment may have increased plasma concentrations of unbound cobimetinib compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Liver laboratory abnormalities can occur with Cotellic and caution should be used in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment. |
