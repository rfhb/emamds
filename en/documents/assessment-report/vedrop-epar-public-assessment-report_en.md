## 2.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Chronic congenital or hereditary cholestasis is a clinical condition where vitamin E deficiency results from  an  impaired  bile  secretion.  This  impairment  may  result  from  bile  duct  malformation  such  as Alagille  syndrome  or  extra-hepatic  biliary  atresia  resulting  in  defective  bile  acid  production  and defective absorption of lipids by the intestine.  Biliary atresia with an incidence of 1/8000 to 1/15000 live  births  is  the  most  frequent  cholestatic  disorder  of  congenital  or  hereditary  origin.    Decreased intestinal  absorption  observed  in  chronic  congenital  or  hereditary  cholestatic  patients  is  due  to decreased bile secretion and the resulting decrease in intestinal cellular absorption. As a result, fatsoluble vitamins ( i.e. A, D, E and K) are not absorbed properly and deficiency can occur. Among these vitamin deficiencies, vitamin E deficiency is one of the most severe, and starts early during childhood.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a defective protein (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator Factor, CFTR) affecting the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract as well as the  exocrine  glands.  Cystic  fibrosis  is  one  of  the  most  common  causes  of  lipid  malabsorption syndrome.  The  most  recent  incidence  estimation  is  approximately  1  in  2500  live  births  in  Europe, where 1 out of 20 persons is a carrier of the CF gene mutation.

Vedrop (tocofersolan) or d-alpha-Tocopheryl Polyethylene Glycol 1000 Succinate (TPGS) is a watersoluble derivative of the natural active (d-alpha) isomer of vitamin E. The active constituent of the medicinal product is essentially vitamin E (alpha tocopherol). This constituent has a well established medicinal use, with recognized efficacy and acceptable safety.

Extensive experience exists with alpha-tocopherol. It was first synthesized in 1938, and 30 years later was granted by the FDA with the status of essential supplement in human nutrition. The degree of scientific  interest  in  a  hydro-soluble  formulation  was  highlighted  in  the  scientific  literature  in  the eighties  and  nineties  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  lipid  malabsorption  diseases.  Vitamin  E  is essential for the normal organization and functioning of the nervous system.

Because of the lack of micellar formation within the intestine, fat-soluble vitamin E preparations are not  appropriate  for  patients  with  lipid  malabsorption.  In  children  with  chronic  cholestasis  several studies demonstrated that only the intra-muscular formulation was able to achieve this objective before the availability of the oral formulation of tocofersolan. The existing water-miscible formulations were not able to properly restore vitamin E blood levels.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Vedrop contains tocofersolan in an amount equivalent to 50 mg/ml tocopherol as the active ingredient. It is presented in the form of 50 mg/ml oral solution.

Other ingredients included are potassium sorbate, sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate, sodium propyl parahydroxybenzoate,  glycerol,  disodium  phosphate  dodecahydrate,  hydrochloric  acid  and  purified water. The primary container consists of 10 ml, 20 ml or 60 ml, coloured glass type III amber glass bottle with a white, HDPE tamper proof cap. A 1-ml or a 2 ml oral syringe CE marked is enclosed in the carton box respectively for the 10 ml/20 ml bottles and the 60 ml bottles.

## Active Substance

The active substance is tocofersolan its chemical name is Poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), a -[4-[[ (2R)-3,4dihydro-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2-[(4R,8R,12R)-(4,8,12-trimethyltricedyl]-2H-1-benzopyran-6-yl]oxy}1,4-dioxobutyl]ω -hydroxy. Tocofersolan is a polymeric mixture prepared by esterification of dalpha tocopherol succinate with polyethylene glycol 1000 (PEG). This results in a mixture of three components; approximately 80 % mono esters (in which tocopherol succinate adds to one end of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

PEG); approximately 12 % di esters (2 tocopherol succinates add, one to each end of the PEG) and unreacted PEGs. It was not demonstrated that the active substance used in the pre-clinical and clinical studies is identical to the present active substance in terms of ratio of monoesters, diesters, free PEG, free tocopherol (succinate) and the molecular weight distribution of PEG.

Tocofersolan is a white to light brown, stable to air but reacts with alkali and miscible with water. Following some stability studies, it was noticed that the active substance is stable in aqueous solutions, However, it was noticed some slow degradation by ester hydrolysis between pH 4 and 8 but rapid at pH 10 and 12.

The active substance contains three chiral centres, is presented as a solid and the melting point is near body temperature.

## · Manufacture

The synthesis of tocofersolan is a straightforward esterification reaction following purification by recrystallisation.  The  reaction  results  in  a  polymeric  mixture  of  components.  It  was  verified  that  no intermediates have been isolated. The manufacturing process has been described and specifications for starting materials, reagents, and solvents have been provided.

It was noticed that the length of PEG could influence the quality, safety and efficacy of the finished product. Therefore, reassurance that either the starting materials, active and/or finished product will be controlled with respect to the PEG chain length must be further demonstrated.

Structure elucidation has been performed by infrared absorption spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, 1 HNMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and ultraviolet spectroscopy. It is important to underline that there are some outstanding issues regarding the quality of the active substance. No information has been provided regarding the composition of the clinical trial batches in terms of the quantities of active species  present  or  with  regard  to  impurities  present.  Furthermore,  the  applicant  should identify  and qualify,  if  necessary  the  impurities  present  in  the  active  substance.  It  was  noticed  that  the  active substance  is  a  mixture  of  mono-ester,  diester  and  free  PEG.  Therefore,  there  are  some  concerns regarding the uncertainty as to their similarity between clinical trial batches and the product intended for commercialisation. In this context, further clarification is needed.

## · Specification

The active substance specifications include tests for appearance (waxy solid, white to light brown), identification (IR), identification of the D (+) enantiomer, acid value, colour gardner, heavy metals, solubility, impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC) and assay. The impurities presented in the active substance should be controlled in the specifications and their limits should be appropriately justified. The applicant should further justify why the molecular mass could not be part of the specification. Regarding formaldehyde the applicant should confirm that none of their stocks of tocofersolan have levels of formaldehyde present which exceed 20µg/ml.

An analytical method for determination of tocopherol succinate, succinic acid and the other impurities is needed.

The non-pharmacopoeia analytical methods, which were used in the routine controls, were described and their validations were presented. Nevertheless, it is important to underline that further validation is  needed  for  some  analytical  methods.  The  limit  for  impurities  above  the  ICH  qualification  level should be tightened if applicable or the proposed limit should be qualified. As already mentioned the applicant  should  identify  and  qualify,  if  necessary  the  impurities  present  in  the  active  substance. Certificates  of  analyses  for  the  active  substances  were  provided  and  batch  analysis  results  were presented.  However, further batch analysis results are needed following further clarification on the unknown impurities and the agreement on the revised specifications.

## · Stability

Taking into account that no accelerated data are available and stability studies at ICH conditions are limited it was agreed that the storage temperature for the active substance should be limited to 25 °C. Furthermore,  it  was  agreed  that  the  active  substance  will  be  reanalysed  according  to  the  revised specifications before the manufacturing of the finished product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Medicinal Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

All information regarding the choice of the active substance and the excipients have been submitted. This particular pharmaceutical form, oral solution, was chosen since this medicinal product might be in the paediatric population. Therefore, an oral solution is easier to administer than solid dosage forms. The solubility of the active substance makes it possible to carry out easily an aqueous solution at the relatively  high  concentration.  It  was  verified  that  the  obtained  solution  was  clear  and  had  physical characteristics (viscosity, pH) suitable for an oral preparation. Taking into account the slight bitterness and insufficient antimicrobial activity this plain solution could not be used. Therefore, the first attempt to improve taste and microbiological stability was addition propylene glycol, but this formula did not meet the expectations. The next attempts to develop the appropriate medicinal product were adding glycerol  and  to  find  a  preservative  system  to  maintain  the  microbiological  quality  of  the  solution throughout the proposed shelf-life and usage. In this context more preservative systems were studied in different concentrations. In order to guarantee the stabilization of the pH throughout the shelf life optimization of buffer concentration was also considered.

The level of propylparaben in the proposed formulation is higher than in other authorised product and in July 2006 the European Parliament agreed to withdraw propylparaben from food products based on advice from EFSA. In this context, it was agreed that the inclusion of this preservative has not been adequately justified.

All other excipients used are well known and commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The manufacturing process for this particular oral solution consists of two main steps (compounding and filling operations) and involves standard technology using standard manufacturing processes such as mixing, blending, pH adjusting, melting, filtering and filling.

The proposed commercial process was validated by two process validation batches.

The batch analysis data show that these new pharmaceutical form can be manufactured according to the proposed finished product specification, which will need to be revised.

## · Product Specification

The  finished  product  specifications  were  established  according  the  ICH  guidelines  and  include  the following tests: appearance, colour, pH, assay (HPLC), potassium sorbate, sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate, sodium propyl parahydroxybenzoate, impurities (HPLC), microbial limits (Ph Eur).  Following  the  assessment  it  was  agreed  that  more  clarification  regarding  the  proposed specifications are needed. In this context, the applicant should consider to update specifications for the finished  product.  Therefore,  an  updated  batch  analysis  data  according  to  the  revised  specification should be submitted.

All analytical procedures that were used for testing the finished product were described and some of them were satisfactorily validated in accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines.

However, further clarifications regarding some analytical methods are needed.

The  batch  analysis  data  for  two  production  scale  and  two  pilot  scale  batches  confirm  that  the  oral solution can be manufactured according to the proposed finished product specifications.

## · Stability of the Product

The  stability  studies  were  conducted  according  to  the  relevant  ICH  guidelines.  Two  laboratory batches,  2  pilot  batches  and  2  production  batches  have  been  stored  at  long  term,  intermediate  and accelerated conditions. All batches were packed in the proposed market packaging. It was verified that the  following  parameters  were  controlled:  colour,  pH,  assay,  content  of  preservatives,  impurities, microbial  purity  and  viscosity.  Based  on  the  available  stability  data,  the  initial  proposed  shelf  life could not be accepted. However, it was agreed that 24 months shelf-life might be acceptable without

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

special storage conditions. Furthermore, it was agreed that after first opening of the container an in-use shelf life of 1 month would be acceptable.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture, control of the active substance and the finished product has been submitted. There are some outstanding issues regarding the quality of the active substance and finished product. The applicant must consider revising the specification of the active substance and finished product. In this context, an updated batch analysis data for the active substance and finished product should have been submitted according to the revised specifications.

No information has been provided regarding the composition of the clinical trial batches in terms of the quantities of active species present or with regard to impurities present. Furthermore, the applicant should identify and qualify, if necessary the impurities present in the active substance. It was noticed that the active substance is a mixture of mono-ester, diester and free PEG. Therefore, there are some concerns regarding the uncertainty as to their similarity between clinical trial batches and the finished product intended for commercialisation. In this context, further clarification will be needed.

Taking into account that this particular medicinal product will be used by a paediatric population and that propylparaben was withdrawn from food products there are some concerns regarding the presence of this preservative at high levels in the final formulation. Therefore, the inclusion of propylparaben in the  proposed  formulation  had  not  been  adequately  justified  and  the  inclusion  of  a  different preservative system should be considered.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Vedrop has been developed over several years and many of the nonclinical studies are old and were not conducted to GLP standards.  Exceptions, where GLP status is confirmed, include a single dose toxicity  study  in  dogs,  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  dogs,  all  genotoxicity  tests  and  one reproductive and developmental toxicity study in rats.

## Pharmacology

- Primary pharmacodynamics

No new pharmacology studies have been provided and the applicant refers to published literature.  In vitro studies using fibroblasts, enterocytes and Caco-2 cells conclude that tocofersolan is taken up as the intact molecule and undergoes a slow hydrolysis reaction, intracellularly, to give PEG 1000 and Vitamin E (dα tocopherol).   The  Applicant has  provided  a summary of relevant published data on Vitamin E, which describes its transport and metabolism.  In summary, Vitamin E is absorbed in the small intestine by passive diffusion processes which require bile salts and transferred to the lymph. Peak levels of activity in the lymph are reached at 4 hours and remain at a plateau until 15 hours. This delay is  attributed  to  the  time  required  for  micelle  formation  and  the  transport  across  the  intestinal mucosa into the lymph.  Vitamin E is packaged in chylomicrons and enters the bloodstream where 15 - 45% of the total vitamin E can be absorbed by cells. Chylomicrons are broken down by lipoprotein lipase and the Vitamin E is dispersed towards a variety of pathways or is stored in adipose tissue. It is reasonable to assume that the dα tocopherol moiety released from tocofersolan would be distributed and metabolised in the same way as Vitamin E.

Studies  using  the  bile  duct-ligated  rat  demonstrated  the  successful  absorption  of  dα tocopherol following tocofersolan administration in the absence of bile salts. Whilst this finding provides some reassurance  that  tocofersolan  administration  enhances  the  absorption  of  dα tocopherol,  only  one animal was used and the study was not conducted to GLP standards. The applicant also refers to the existence  of  clinical  data  following  administration  of  tocofersolan  in  vitamin  E  deficient  children. Such clinical data supersede nonclinical data and obviate the need for further nonclinical studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Secondary pharmacodynamics

No  secondary  pharmacology  studies  or  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  conducted,  which  is considered acceptable given that treatment with Vedrop is effectively a replacement therapy.

- Safety pharmacology

No safety pharmacology studies were conducted. This is considered acceptable given that treatment with Vedrop is effectively a replacement therapy. Furthermore, it is not anticipated that Vedrop will have  any  pharmacological  effects  other  than  the  intended  primary  effects  of  development  and maintenance of the central nervous system and skeletal muscle.

- Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been discussed by the applicant; none are anticipated as the active substance is a vitamin which is present in healthy individuals.

## Pharmacokinetics

Plasma levels of α -tocopherol were measured in dogs and pregnant rabbits and Tmax, Cmax and AUC were  determined.  Large  variations  were  seen  in  the  dog  study  where  only  two  animals  were  used. More specifically one animal eliminated α -tocopherol from the blood biphasically whereas the other appeared to show monophasic elimination.  Such variations are not unexpected as the animals were not vitamin deficient and were on a diet supplemented with α -tocopherol.

ADME studies were conducted using radiolabelled tocofersolan administered to rats. The radiolabel was placed in the PEG1000 moiety which is cleaved from α -tocopherol following absorption in the intestine,  therefore  the  studies  only  describe  the  fate  of  PEG1000.  This  is  reasonable  given  that  a wealth of published data on Vitamin E distribution and metabolism are available and it follows that the α -tocopherol from tocofersolan will have a similar fate to that absorbed from the diet. Distribution studies conclude that PEG1000 is not taken up or retained in the tissues when administered on its own or as tocofersolan.

No metabolism studies have been submitted in support of this application. However it is known that tocofersolan is cleaved intracellularly to give α -tocopherol, succinic acid and PEG1000, all of which have been described in the literature. As such, the lack of metabolism studies is accepted, although that insufficient detail of the proposed intracellular cleavage was provided in the original dossier.

Oral  administration  of  [ 14 C]  tocofersolan  and  PEG1000  allowed  the  excretion  of  PEG1000  to  be investigated. Whether administered as tocofersolan or on its own the majority of [ 14 C] PEG1000 was detected in the faeces with values of 76.9 and 95.3 %, respectively. The percentage of dose detected in the urine was higher following administration of tocofersolan than when PEG1000 was administered alone (13.1% compared with 6.7%), which corresponds to the amount of dose absorbed.

No  pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been carried out, however  the ability of tocofersolan to enhance the bioavailability of other drugs is well known.

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

Single  dose  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  rats,  rabbits,  guinea  pigs  and  dogs  using  oral  (both gavage  and  dietary),  intramuscular,  intraperitoneal,  subcutaneous,  ocular  and  dermal  routes  of administration. No treatment-related findings were reported, as all clinical observations and findings at autopsy  were  similar  in  treatment  and  control  groups.  In  many  of  the  studies,  the  LD 50 was  not determined as tocofersolan was well tolerated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

In repeat dose studies in the rat and dog using dietary and oral (gavage) routes of administration no treatment-related  effects  were  seen.  Consequently  there  are  no  toxicity  concerns  following  chronic treatment with tocofersolan.

The plasma concentration of αtocopherol was determined at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months in the repeat dose toxicity studies in the rat and dog. No Tmax, Cmax or AUC values were presented and no animal:human exposure multiples  have  been  calculated.    A  high  variation  between  animals  in  the  same  treatment group  was  seen  and  therefore αtocopherol  concentration  and  dose  proportionality  was  difficult  to discern.  This  could  be  due  to  the  measurement  of  both αtocopherol  following  tocofersolan administration and endogenous Vitamin E absorbed from the diet.  No relationship between the doses used and the proposed therapeutic doses has been discussed, although in light of the results of acute and  chronic  toxicity  studies  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  any  toxicity  will  be  observed  at  the  doses proposed for each indication.

- Genotoxicity

A  standard  battery  of  genotoxicity  tests  has  been  conducted,  which  produced  negative  results. Therefore tocofersolan does not appear to be genotoxic.

- Carcinogenicity

No carcinogenicity studies were conducted, however tocofersolan is not mutagenic and no hormone disturbances have been reported in the repeat dose toxicity studies.  Reassuringly, there are data to suggest that Vitamin E inhibits cell proliferation, and overall it is considered unlikely that tocofersolan possesses any carcinogenic potential.

- Reproduction Toxicity

A battery of reproductive toxicity tests were conducted in rats and rabbits using the dietary and oral routes. No treatment-related effects were seen on the fertility of male and female rats, embryo-fetal development or on periand post-natal development. Toxicokinetic analysis following oral administration  of  tocofersolan  in  pregnant  rabbits  confirmed  exposure  to α -tocopherol,  therefore tocofersolan is not considered to be toxic to reproduction.

The  proposed  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  is  for  the  use  of  Vedrop  in  two  paediatric indications.    Only  one  acute  toxicity  study  has  been  conducted  to  assess  the  potential  effects  on juvenile rats using the oral route.  This study was carried out some time ago and is not of a currently acceptable  standard.  Many  deaths  were  seen  across  all  treatment  groups  which  were  attributed  to mechanical injury.

- Local tolerance and other toxicity studies

No local tolerance or other toxicity studies were conducted, which is acceptable as the results from the repeated dose toxicity studies do not raise any antigenicity or immunogenicity concerns. Additionally, no  metabolism  studies  were  conducted  which  is  acceptable  given  that  there  are  only  3  possible metabolites. Two of which are endogenous substances ( αtocopherol and succinic acid) and the other is PEG 1000, which has been used in several pharmaceutical products.

Several impurities associated with the drug substance (impurities 3, 6 and 9) have been detected in stability studies, that are above the qualification threshold in the ICH guideline on impurities in new drug products and appropriate toxicological qualification is lacking.

The proposed excipients are well known and are used in several pharmaceutical products. High levels of preservatives are included in the proposed drug product. While the total amount of ethyl and methylparabens is below the daily limit of 10 mg/kg/day, the EC Scientific Committee for Food

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(SCF) was unable to recommend an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for propylparaben. Taking into account the high level of propylparaben in the proposed paediatric formulation and the withdrawal of propylparaben from food products by the European Parliament it was considered that the inclusion of this preservative has not been adequately justified.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The  applicant  has  provided  a  revised  environmental  risk  assessment.  The  marketing  of  Vedrop  is unlikely to pose a risk to the environment.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The applicant's own data is limited to two pharmacokinetic studies. The published efficacy and safety data have been gathered mostly in the USA but also from publications in the EU and Japan.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. No issues regarding GCP aspects have been identified during the review of the dossier.

## Pharmacokinetics

- Absorption / Distribution/ Elimination

The applicant has submitted two studies which aim to describe the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Vedrop. The first  study  investigated  the  bioavailability  of  two  vitamin  E  formulations  (Test  versus Reference  preparations)  following  a  single  oral  dose  in  12  healthy  volunteers.    The  second  study investigated the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of the two vitamin E formulations after a single oral dose administration in 12 paediatric patients (6 with chronic cholestasis, 6 with cystic fibrosis).

In addition, data from the literature comprising several pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers were  submitted.  These  involved  different  study  designs  and  were  performed  during  different  time periods. As such it is not possible to draw any firm conclusions from the findings of these studies.

## Study No. 1 (In Healthy Subjects)

This  was  an  open;  two-way  cross-over  randomized  study  which  investigated  the  pharmacokinetic profiles  of  single  oral  doses  of  two  vitamin  E  formulations,  the  Vitamin  E  TPGS  Orphan  Europe formulation  (tocofersolan)  and  the  Vitamin  E  Cambridge  formulation.    Both  treatments  were administered at an equivalent dose of 1200 I.U. to twelve healthy male volunteers.  However Vitamin E TPGS Orphan Europe contains d-alpha tocopherol, for which bio-availability is about 1.33 times higher  than  the  dl-alpha-tocopheryl  acetate  contained  in  the  Vitamin  E  Cambridge  formulation. Therefore,  subjects  received  800  mg  d-alpha  tocopherol  and  1200  mg  dl-alpha  tocopheryl  acetate (corresponding  to  1093  mg  of  dl-alpha  tocopherol).  This  implies  that  37%  less  tocopherol  was administered  with  the  Vitamin  E  TPGS  Orphan  Europe  formulation  than  with  the  Vitamin  E Cambridge  formulation.  The  doses  of  800  mg  and  1093  mg  were  used  to  calculate  normalized pharmacokinetic parameters in this report.  Between each drug administration, there was a washout period of 14 days.  Blood samples were collected prior to Vitamin E intake and 3, 6, 9, 12, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post dosing. The following pharmacokinetic parameters have been determined during this study: Peak plasma concentration (Cmax), time to peak plasma concentration (tmax), AUC(0-t), half life parameters for absorption (t½abs ), distribution (t½ λ 1) and elimination (t½ β ) and AUC(0-∞ ) .

The mean delta plasma profiles (after subtracting baseline endogenous vitamin E concentrations) in healthy  male  volunteers  following  a  single  administration  of  1200  I.U.  (International  Units)  are presented in the Table 1 and Figure 1 below.

The statistical analysis was performed after normalization of the Cmax and AUC values by the dose administered as the administered tocopherol doses were 800 mg alpha-tocopherol for tocofersolan and 1093 mg alpha-tocopherol for the reference formulation, both corresponding to 1200 IU and as the biochemical determination was on alpha-tocopherol, without any stereo-isomeric separation.

In this small population of 12 healthy volunteers, bioequivalence of the two formulations was not established. However, the dose strengths of the two products appear to be of comparable Vitamin E activity.

## Study No. 2 (In Paediatric Patients)

The  objective  of  the  study  was  to  compare  the  pharmacokinetics  and  tolerability  of  two  vitamin formulations given orally in 6 chronic cholestatic and  6 cystic fibrosis paediatric patients at a vitamin E dose of 100 I.U./kg in an open; two-way cross-over randomized study. Chronic cholestatic patients were already hospitalised at the time of their inclusion in the present study. No change was made to the  on-going  hospitalisation  conditions.    Cystic  fibrosis  patients  were  hospitalised  on  each  drug administration  day.  They  then  remained  in  the  clinical  unit  under  permanent  medical  and  nursing supervision for 24 hours after each administration.  Pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained following administration  of  single  oral  doses  of  two  vitamin  E  formulations,  the  Orphan  Europe  Vitamin  E TPGS formulation and the Cambridge Vitamin E formulation.

After  dosage  adjustment for  equipotency,  the  subjects  received  66.7  mg/kg  dl-alpha  tocopherol  and 91.1 mg/kg dl-alpha tocopherol (as tocopherol acetate in water- miscible formulation).   Between each drug administration, there was a washout period of 7 days.  Blood samples were collected prior to Vitamin E intake and 3, 6, 9, 12, 12 and 24 hours post dosing. One of the 6 patients with chronic cholestasis  was  excluded  from  the  analysis  because  plasma  concentrations  were  considered  as  not reliable by the analytical laboratory (CVs of the triplicate at baseline determination not fulfilling preestablished criterion for acceptability of the data).

In  patients  with  chronic  cholestasis,  the  mean  (±  SD)  peak  plasma  concentrations  were  higher following Vedrop than following reference vitamin E with values of 25.5 (± 4.3) µmol/L, after test formulation versus 16.1 (± 3.2) µmol/L after the reference formulation. Similarly, AUC0-t values were higher  with  mean  (±  SD)  of  459  (±  90)  µmol/L.hr versus 310  (±  66)  µmol/L.hr  following administration  of  the test  and  reference  formulations  respectively.    The  results  of  the  main pharmacokinetic parameters for chronic cholestasis are summarised in the following table 3 and figure 2.

The test product, d-alpha tocopherol contained in Vitamin E TPGS, has higher bioavailability than the reference  product,  dl-alpha-tocopherol  contained  in  the  Vitamin  E  Cambridge  formulation.    The applicant  made  weight/dosage  adjustments  to  enable  comparing  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters between the two formulations. The weight-base dose normalizing is not acceptable because after this adjustment the biological activities of the two formulations to be compared will be different.

Thus after taking into account the dosage adjustments, plasma Vitamin E concentrations of the Test and Reference preparations were largely comparable in healthy subjects, but the methodology for the comparison was incorrect.  In children with chronic cholestasis, the plasma Vitamin E levels of the Test  product  were  clearly  higher  compared  with  Reference  formulation.  In  children  with  cystic fibrosis,  this  relationship  was  reversed;  the  plasma  Vitamin  E  levels  of  the  Test  product  were demonstrably lower compared with the Reference formulation.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

This issue has not explicitly been studied.  However the data provided indicate non-linear kinetics. No further studies are required as this issue does not seem to generate any safety issue.

## · Special populations

Studies in special populations were not performed. The applicant was requested to comment on the absence  of  pharmacokinetic  data  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  (given  the  known  nephrotoxic effects of glycol molecules). The applicant was also asked to discuss the possible influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics for Vitamin E preparations, as the main metabolic pathways of tocofersolan involve the liver.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on additional literature review submitted in response to CHMP questions, the CHMP agreed that this could be resolved by a relevant precautionary statement in the product information, were the product to be marketed.

- Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

Specific PK interaction studies were not performed. The applicant provided a discussion of literature data.    Tocofersolan  is  a  strong  P-gp  inhibitor  even  at  therapeutic  doses,  and  consequently  a bioavailability enhancer. Co-administration with immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus or cyclosporine can lead to possible interactions.

## Pharmacodynamics

- Mechanism of action

The  applicant  has  submitted  several  publications  which  describe  the  pharmacodynamic  actions  of alpha tocopherol both in healthy subjects and in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic congenital cholestasis.

Vitamin E is the principal lipo-soluble antioxidant in the living organism. It acts as a free radical chain breaking  molecule,  stopping  the  peroxidation  of  polyunsaturated  fatty  acids.  Vitamin  E  is  also involved in maintaining the stability and integrity of cell membranes via the phytyl side chain which interacts with polyunsaturated fatty acids especially arachidonic acids.

- Primary and Secondary pharmacology

The mechanism of action in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic cholestasis has sufficiently been investigated and is well known (resistance to oxidative reactions and to tissue damage). The influence of plasma alpha-tocopherol on neurological complications was described on histo-pathological studies and confirmed in the population of children with chronic cholestasis. No additional data are therefore required.

## Clinical efficacy

- Dose response study(ies)

There  are  no  dose-ranging  studies  available  in  this  patient  population  with  any  of  formerly  tested formulations  of  vitamin  E,  neither  with  tocofersolan.  In  this  regard,  the  dosing  regimen  has  been derived from the doses administered to study patients.

- Main study (ies)

Several  publications  of  the  main  efficacy  clinical  trials  (from  published  literature)  involving  130 patients  have  been  submitted  with  the  current  application,  and  are  summarized  in  the  table  below. Three of these were considered as pivotal (in bold type), while some of the other studies are not more than case reports. All three key studies involve paediatric patients with chronic cholestasis. Apart from one small study, there are no clinical trial data in patients with cystic fibrosis.  Most of studies appear to have been conducted by the same clinical team in the US (Sokol et al .).

Given that these diseases are relatively rare, the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy. In the absence of an established active comparator as reference treatment and, considering the limited number of patients, the majority of studies were of open trials design. Most children in these studies had a long history of resistance to conventional treatment, i.e.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

very high vitamin E dosage (100 to 400 mg/day when recommended FDA daily intakes are 5 to 15 mg/day).    Usually,  comparisons  were  made  before  and  after  treatment  by  tocofersolan  after  oral vitamin E absorption evaluation and then during the long-term treatment of these patients.

## Clinical efficacy of TPGS /tocofersolan in chronic cholestasis

Several  clinical  observations  and  a  few  studies  have  been  published  which  demonstrate  clinical efficacy  of  tocofersolan  in  chronic  cholestasis.  Apart  from  the  three  pivotal  studies,  some  of  these publications are no more than case reports. One of three pivotal trials appears comprehensive and is summarized below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## METHODS

This  multicentre  trial  in  children  with  chronic  cholestasis  (Sokol,  1993)  investigated  60  vitamin  Edeficient patients unresponsive to massive (up to 200 IU/kg/day) dosages of oral dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate.  The patients were recruited over 8 centers in the USA and diagnoses included 17 patients with  Alagille  syndrome,  19  with  extra-hepatic  biliary  atresia,  13  with  intra-hepatic  progressive cholestasis,  5  with  non-syndromic  paucity  of  interlobular  bile  ducts  (PIBD)  and  6  with  persisting neonatal hepatitis.  The age range of the patients was 0.5 to 20 years (mean 6.4 ± 0.8 years).  All had a history of resistant vitamin E-deficiency and had baseline biochemical and neurological tests. Subjects were monitored first at 2 and 4 weeks and then every 3 to 4 months.

Neurological  scoring  was  performed  every  6  months  and  a  minimum  of  6-month  follow-up  was necessary to assess the clinical  response.  Scores  were  given  for  12 symptoms  (hyporeflexia,  ataxia, impairment of vibratory sensation, dysarthria, etc.) and ranged from normal (0) to severely abnormal (3 +). The initial dosage of tocofersolan was 25 IU/kg/day and was adjusted throughout the study to achieve  a  vitamin  E/total  lipid  ratio ≥ 0.8  mg/g  ( ≥ 18.6  µmol/g).  However  two  different  vitamin  E products were used in this trial. Between 1985-1989 a d-alpha-tocopherol succinate formulated in the hospital  pharmacy  from  pure  TPGS  and  since  1989  a  commercial  preparation  (Ligui-E  Qine Laboratories Ronconcome N.Y.)

Plasma vitamin E levels/total lipids ratio before treatment ranged from 6.5 to 17.9 µmol/g depending on  the  severity  of  the  disease  with  a  mean  (±  SD)  of  11.6  ( ± 1.6)  µmol/g.  Patients  with  Alagille syndrome and with PIBD presented higher vitamin E plasma concentrations but vitamin E/lipid ratio within the range of patients with other diagnoses.

All  patients  receiving  tocofersolan  reached  the  biochemical  target  (0.8  mg/g)  within  1  month:  with plasma vitamin E ranging from 20.7 to 39.7 µmol/g of lipids depending on the clinical form. Patients with  progressive  intra-hepatic  cholestasis  and  patients  with  neonatal  hepatitis  presented  the  highest responses  (both  39.7  µmol/g).  Mean  (±  SD)  values  for  all  60  patients  were  1.4 ± 0.1  mg/g  with  a significant (p &lt;0.05) increase by comparison to values at entry.

The mean duration of treatment was 2.3 ± 0.2  years and treatment was carried out up to 7 years in some patients.

## RESULTS

Fifty four patients completed neurological scoring (mean duration of treatment: 2.5 years). All patients older than 4 years (except two) on entering the study presented an abnormal neurological score. The two remaining patients had received parenteral vitamin E since infancy and had no vitamin deficiency and no neurological symptoms at entry.

Mean neurologic score decreased significantly from 4.7 ± 0.7  to  4.0 ± 0.7  (p  &lt;0.001).  Twenty five patients improved, 27 were stabilized and only two worsened.

Neurological response to tocofersolan was also analyzed by age of patients at entry. Age groups were: &lt;4 years (N=28); from 4 to 10 years (N=13); and &gt;10 years (N=13). Results are presented in Table 6 below.  Outcome  under  treatment  strongly  correlated  with  age  at  entry  into  the  study  (r  =  0.78;  p &lt;0.001).

The results of this study showed that:

All 60 children responded to 20-25 IU/kg/day TPGS solution with normalization of vitamin E/total lipid blood levels.

Neurological symptoms were either improved or stabilized in 96% of patients. This study confirmed the  critical  role  of  vitamin  E  deficiency  in  neurological  abnormalities  in  patients  with  chronic congenital or hereditary cholestasis.

## Clinical efficacy of TPGS /tocofersolan in Cystic fibrosis

Very little data have been submitted to demonstrate clinical efficacy of tocofersolan in patients with cystic fibrosis.

In response to the CHMP LOQs the applicant has provided an additional 6 months open-label ongoing study in cystic fibrosis patients which is essentially a safety study.  Although interim analysis of the 3 months  results  appear  to  show  maintenance  of  normal  plasma  levels  of  alpha-tocopherol  after  3 months of administration of Vedrop, it is not possible to assess whether this treatment is effective, even  when  considering  plasma  Vitamin  E  levels  as  a  biochemical  surrogate  marker  of  efficacy. Another problem is that it was an open study without using any comparator preparation.

- Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Not applicable.

- Clinical studies in special populations

No data has been submitted. Please refer to discussion under Pharmacokinetics

- Supportive study(ies)

Please refer to the table under section 'Main studies'

- Discussion on clinical efficacy

The  available  clinical  efficacy  data  appear  to  indicate  that  in  patients  with  congenital  chronic cholestasis, tocofersolan may lead to an improvement in neurological symptoms or at least prevent the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

deterioration of neurological symptoms.  The same is not the case with regards to patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) as there is virtually no efficacy data in these patients.

## Clinical safety

- Patient exposure

With regards to safety, experience concerning the clinical safety of tocofersolan is mainly based on published papers in the literature (in 27 healthy volunteers and 116 patients) and on the applicant's sponsored studies (in 12 healthy volunteers and 12 patients).

- Adverse events

Tocofersolan is taken  up by  cells  as  the  intact  molecule,  hydrolyzed  intra-cellularly  and  the  alphatocopherol  moiety  then  appears  in  chylomicrons  in  the  lymph  in  a  manner  identical  to  vitamin  E absorbed from the diet as shown in vitro . Therefore, safety issues from clinical experience both with tocofersolan or TGPS and with vitamin E were presented.

The other  constituent  of  Vedrop,  Polyethylene  Glycol  1000,  has  also  been  used  for  decades  in  the preparations  of  several  medicinal  products.  It  does  not  contribute  to  the  pharmacological  action  of Vedrop. It only acts as a vector of vitamin E to its intestinal absorption sites ( i.e. the apical membrane of  the  enterocytes)  in  cases  where  physiological  lipo-solubilizing  agents  are  missing  because  of  an underlying disease.

Overall, adverse effects seen with tocofersolan therapy appear to be not serious and are mostly related to the gastrointestinal tract. These AEs are often dose-related. Vitamin E and tocofersolan have been used as supplements in many patients over many years. However data from controlled trials are sparse.

- Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

No serious adverse events or deaths related to tocofersolan have been reported

- Laboratory findings

The  clinically  relevant  laboratory  findings  observed  in  the  submitted  data  were:  abnormal  serum sodium, abnormal serum potassium and 1 case of transaminase increase.

- Safety in special populations

Please refer to discussion under Pharmacokinetics.

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Due to limited data and lack of systematic controlled studies, no definite conclusions can be drawn regarding  drug-drug  or  other  interactions.    However,  available  evidence  indicates  that  tocofersolan increases plasma levels of fat soluble vitamins (vitamin D or vitamin A) when these substances are concomitantly administered with tocofersolan.

- Discontinuation due to adverse events

From the limited number of controlled data provided no conclusions can be drawn on discontinuation due to adverse events.

- Post marketing experience

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The product was not licensed in any country at the time of submission of the application. Up to End of November 2008, 173 patients have been treated with tocofersolan in Europe on a namepatient basis. Orphan Europe has received clinical information for 62 of these 173 patients. Only 1 patient experienced one adverse event (diarrhea).

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP considered that the  Pharmacovigilance system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application was of the opinion that it was not appropriate to consider risk minimisation activities at this time.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The  quality  of  this  product  is  not  considered  to  be  acceptable.  There  are  some  outstanding  issues regarding the quality of the active substance and the finished product, which need further clarification. It can be concluded that the unresolved quality issues have negative impact on the benefit/risk balance.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were carried out. However the ability of tocofersolan to enhance the bioavailability of other drugs is well known. This has been addressed by incorporation of appropriate warnings in section 4.4 of the SPC.

Appropriate toxicological qualification should be provided for the drug substance impurities that have been  detected  above  the  qualification  threshold  in  the  ICH  guideline  on  impurities  in  new  drug products.

## Efficacy

The clinical part of the application is essentially based on publications.  The applicant's own data is limited to two pharmacokinetic studies - one in 12 healthy subjects and the other in 12 patients (6 with chronic  cholestasis,  6  with  cystic  fibrosis).    Pharmacodynamic,  efficacy  and  safety  data  have  been gathered mostly in the USA but also from publications in the EU and Japan.

Several  publications  have  been  submitted  which  describe  the  pharmacodynamic  actions  of  alpha tocopherol  both  in  healthy  subjects  and  in  patients  with  cystic  fibrosis  and  chronic  congenital cholestasis.

There  are  no  dose-ranging  studies  available  in  this  patient  population  with  any  of  formerly  tested formulations of vitamin E, neither with tocofersolan.  The proposed dosing regimen has been derived from the doses administered to study patients in published literature.

Several publications of the main efficacy clinical trials  involving  130  patients  have  been  submitted with this application.  Three of these were considered as pivotal. All three studies involve paediatric patients with chronic cholestasis. Apart from one small study, there are no clinical trial data in patients with cystic fibrosis.  Most studies have been conducted by the same clinical team in the US.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

From the data provided it appears  that  in  patients  with  congenital  chronic  cholestasis,  tocofersolan may  lead  to  an  improvement  in  neurological  symptoms  or  at  least  prevent  the  deterioration  of neurological symptoms.  The same is not the case with regards to patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) as there  is  virtually  no  efficacy  data  in  these  patients.  The  applicant  has  provided  a  3  months  interim analysis of an additional 6 months open-label ongoing clinical trial in CF patients. However, this is essentially a safety study.

There  are  also  concerns  that  the  material  used  in  the  publications  has  not  been  sufficiently characterised,  such  that  it  is  uncertain  whether  the  product  intended  for  marketing  is  the  same  or sufficiently similar to that used in the studies submitted as publications. Taking into account that the so called 'pivotal' studies in chronic cholestasis had been performed more than 15-20 years ago and that  the  pegilation  of  vitamin  E  was  partly  done  in  a  local  hospital  pharmacy  ('home-made' preparation), the bridging data between the preparation used in those clinical studies and the product intended for marketing are missing.

## Safety

Experience concerning the clinical safety of tocofersolan is mainly based on published papers in the literature (in 27 healthy volunteers and 116 patients) and on the applicant's sponsored studies (in 12 healthy volunteers and 42 patients).

Tocofersolan is taken  up by  cells  as  the  intact  molecule,  hydrolyzed  intra-cellularly  and  the  alphatocopherol  moiety  then  appears  in  chylomicrons  in  the  lymph  in  a  manner  identical  to  vitamin  E absorbed from the diet as shown in vitro . The other constituent of Vedrop, Polyethylene Glycol 1000, does not contribute to the pharmacological action of Vedrop. It only acts as a vector of vitamin E to its intestinal absorption sites ( i.e. the apical membrane of the enterocytes) in cases where physiological lipo-solubilizing agents are missing because of an underlying disease.

Overall, adverse effects seen with tocofersolan therapy appear to be not serious, are mostly related to the  gastrointestinal  tract,  and  are  often  dose-related.  Vitamin  E  and  tocofersolan  have  been  used  as supplements in many patients over many years. However data from controlled trials are sparse. Due to limited data and lack of systematic controlled studies, no definite conclusions can be drawn regarding drug-drug interactions or other interactions.  However, available evidence indicates that tocofersolan increases plasma levels of Vitamin D when the two substances are concomitantly administered (which would require an appropriate warning statement in the SPC).

## Risk-benefit assessment

Chronic congenital or hereditary cholestasis and cystic fibrosis are responsible for severe deficit in lipid  absorption  by  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  One  of  the  consequences  is  a  deficit  in  liposoluble vitamins  which  gives  rise  to  numerous  related  clinical  symptoms.  Vitamin  E  deficiency  has  been identified  as  being  responsible  for  severe  and  evolving  neurological  disorders,  which  may  be preventable when treated properly early in the child's life.

Due  to  failing  lipid-dependent  absorption  mechanisms,  dl-alpha-tocopheryl  acetate  formulations  of vitamin  E  are  not  absorbed  properly  by  these  patients,  leading  to  incomplete  correction  of  the deficiency. This situation generates persistent and worsening neurological symptoms.  Tocofersolan is a  water-soluble  derivative  of  the  natural  active  (d-alpha  tocopherol)  isomer  of  vitamin  E,  in  which polyethylene glycol is esterified to dα -tocopherol via a succinic acid bridge.

Tocofersolan  has  been  shown  to  be  effective  in  correcting  blood  vitamin  E  levels  in  patients presenting  with  lipid  malabsorption  (at  least  in  patients  with  chronic  cholestasis)  and  appears appropriate for treating the affected children.  From the historical data submitted, tocofersolan may be effective  in  correcting  or  preventing  neurological  symptoms  in  patients  with  congenital  chronic cholestasis.  The extent of regression of neurological symptoms depends on the age of the patients and the duration of malabsorption.  Tocofersolan seems effective in preventing neurological complications when given early to patients, preferably before the age of 3 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The following main risks were identified:

- Nephrotoxicity  is  an  established  adverse  effect  of  glycols,  particularly  small  glycol  molecules, e.g. ethylene and diethylene glycol or low-molecular-weight PEG. Results from animal and human studies appear not to substantiate this risk with regard to the high-molecular-weight PEG 1000. An appropriate precautionary statement in the SPC could address this.
- The composition of the clinical trial batches has not been sufficiently characterised in terms of active  species  and  impurities,  and  it  was  not  established  whether  the  impurities  had  been adequately qualified.
- The demonstration of efficacy, both clinically and biochemically, in patients with cystic fibrosis is insufficient.
- The inclusion of propylparaben in the proposed paediatric formulation has not been adequately justified.
- There was insufficient evidence that the formulation of the investigational product was the same as Vedrop intended for marketing.

The applicant addressed the above points (with the exception of the first) during an oral explanation and proposed to drop the Cystic Fibrosis indication. However, after the oral explanation the CHMP was still of the opinion that these remaining issues were not satisfactorily addressed. In addition, there was a long list of further questions (as outlined in the post day 180 assessment report) that had not been satisfactorily addressed.

-  Quality  issues  regarding  the  quality  of  the  starting  materials,  the  quality  of  the  active substance,  validation  of  analytical  methods,  further  clarification  on  analytical  methods, updated batch analysis and impurities.
-   Outstanding issues regarding the finished product, which were raised in the Day 180 Joint AR, including  clarification  regarding  the  control  of  the  ionic  strength  by  osmolarity,  updated specifications of the finished product, clarification on the method used for the determination of the free PEG 1000, description and validation of aspecific method to control PEG content of  the  finished  product,  further  clarification  regarding  the  release  specification  and  updated batch analysis according to the revised specification.
-  Appropriate  toxicological  qualification  for  the  drug  substance  impurities  which  have  been detected  above  the  qualification  threshold  in  the  ICH  guideline  on  impurities  in  new  drug products.
-  The Risk-management plan should be further revised.

Tocofersolan  seems  effective  in  correcting  blood  vitamin  E  levels  in  patients  presenting  with  lipid malabsorption due to chronic cholestasis; historical data suggests that tocofersolan may be effective in correcting  or  preventing  neurological  symptoms  in  patients  with  congenital  chronic  cholestasis. Approval of congenital chronic cholestasis due to \"exceptional circumstances\" on the basis of \"unmet medical need\" for this rare condition (which has an incidence of approximately 1/8000 to 1/15000 live births)  was  considered.  However,  approval  was  deemed  not  possible  as  many  outstanding  issues remain, particularly relating to quality aspects, characterisation of the clinical trial material, bridging between the material used in the publications and the product intended for marketing. In any case there is insufficient information to consider a positive opinion for cystic fibrosis.

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP during their meeting of January  2009  considered  by  consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Vedrop  in  the  treatment of vitamin  E  deficiency  due  to  digestive  malabsorption  in  paediatric  patients  suffering  from  cystic fibrosis,  congenital  chronic  cholestasis  or  hereditary  chronic  cholestasis was  unfavourable  and therefore did not recommend the granting of the marketing authorisation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## GROUNDS FOR REFUSAL

## QUALITY

- -The inclusion of propylparaben in the proposed paediatric formulation has not been adequately justified
- -The composition of the clinical trial batches has not been sufficiently characterised in terms of active  species  and  impurities,  and  it  was  not  established  whether  the  impurities  had  been adequately identified and qualified.
- -The specification of the active substance and finished product should be revised and updated batch analysis data for the active substance and finished product should have been resubmitted according to the revised specifications.

## EFFICACY AND SAFETY:

- -The demonstration of PK and clinical efficacy in patients with cystic fibrosis was insufficient
- -There was insufficient evidence that the formulation of the investigational product was the same as Vedrop intended for marketing.

In view of the above the CHMP, during their meeting of January 2009, has recommended the refusal of the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for Vedrop.

In  addition,  there  were  the  unresolved  questions, as outlined  in the  post  day  180  assessment  report (summarised above in the section 3.6 Risk-benefit assessment).

## 2.7 Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of January 2009

Following the CHMP Opinion concluding that the benefit risk of Vedrop administered for vitamin E deficiency  due  to  digestive  malabsorption  in  paediatric  patients  suffering  from  cystic  fibrosis, congenital  chronic  cholestasis  or  hereditary  chronic  cholestasis was  not  favourable,  the  applicant submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of the grounds for refusal.

## Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant

## QUALITY

## Ground for re-examination 1: The inclusion of propylparaben in the proposed paediatric formulation has not been adequately justified

## Applicant`s position

The  antimicrobial  preservative  system  combines  three  preservatives  selected  for  their  well  known antimicrobial  and  antifungal  efficacy.  The  combination  of  propylparaben  (0.09%)  /methylparaben (0.3%) is widely used as being known to be the most effective antimicrobial system against moulds and  bacteria.  It  was  noted  that  propylparaben  can  be  found  in  more  than  one  hundred  oral pharmaceutical formulations.

The selected concentrations in potassium sorbate (0.5%), sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (0.3%) and  sodium  propyl  parahydroxybenzoate  (0.09%)  were  justified  on  the  basis  of  studies  of  efficacy according  to  monograph  5.1.3  \"Efficacy  of  antimicrobial  preservation\"  of  the  current  European Pharmacopoeia edition.

The  concentrations  of  both  parabens  were  optimized  in  order  to  have  the  minimal  effective concentration regarding the antimicrobial test. Methylparaben and propylparaben in Vedrop

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

formulation were also associated to potassium sorbate in order to amplify the antimicrobial efficacy of the preservative system.

During the pharmaceutical development, different formulations containing increasing concentrations of methylparaben/propylparaben were tested with 5.1.3 of the Ph.Eur. None of the formulations was compliant  with  the  requirements.  Therefore,  a  third  preservative  system,  which  included  potassium sorbate was selected since it is in compliance with the Ph.Eur. requirements.

The  formulation  with  methylparaben  (0.3%)  /propylparaben  (0.09%)  and  of  potassium  sorbate (0.50%) was studied at different pH. The formulations found compliant with the requirements were those at pH 6.0 and 6.3 only. The disodium phosphate has been used as a buffer in order to stabilize the  pH.  After  6  months  stability  in  accelerated  conditions  (40°C/75%  RH),  it  was  verified  that  the formulation at pH 6.0 was found to be the more stable. In this context, this formulation at pH 6.0 was selected and then developed.

It is important to underline that during the evaluation of the dossier, some parameters were studied in order to assess the robustness of the preservative system during the manufacturing of the drug product. It  was  concluded  that  at  the  lowest  concentration  of  90%  in  the  parabens,  the  system  was  not compliant with the Ph.Eur. test but at minimum 93% for a pH range of 5.5 to 6.0.

The influence of the ionic strength showed that the efficacy of the preservative system was maintained in the range of 2600 to 4500 mOsm/Kg.

Furthermore, according to the micellar structure of the TPGS, at the concentration in Vedrop (i.e. 17.8 %), the preservative system was found to be more potent at lower concentrations down to 0.5% of TPGS  in  Vedrop  solution,  and  being  efficient  even  at  80%  of  the  nominal  concentrations  of  the parabens.  The  micellar  structure  of  TPGS  has  probably  an  inactivating  effect  of  a  fraction  of  the parabens  that  are  hydrophobic,  justifying  the  level  of  the  efficient  concentration  for  the  parabens needed for the preservation of the system.

This preservative system was shown to be compliant with the specifications through all the shelf-life of the finished product formulation with a good stability over time.

Acute toxicity studies in animals indicate that propylparaben is relatively non-toxic by both oral and parenteral routes, although it is mildly irritating to the skin. Furthermore, according to some scientific publications propylparaben is not carcinogenic, mutagenic or clastogenic ( Soni 2001 ).

The applicant quotes an analysis of preclinical data by the Afssaps, which concluded in June 2004 that the  safety  profile  of  the  parabens  is  good,  with  several  years  of  clinical  experience  ( Afssaps  site  bulletins  de  vigilance ).  Recently,  studies  have  demonstrated  that  parabens  can  bind  to  oestrogenic receptors,  activate  them  and  induce  a  physiological  response  in  some  animal  models.  Nevertheless, these  compounds are from 1,000 to 1,000,000 times less  potent  than  the  17  beta-estradiol  ( Golden 2005 ).

From a theoretical point of view, this oestrogenic activation may induce two types of risks in humans: 1) the potential promotion of oestrogenic-dependent tumors, in particular mammary tumors, and 2) the potential alteration of fertility. Regarding the risk of tumors, no valid experimental data can support an increased risk of breast cancer. Regarding potential alteration of fertility, studies conducted in 2001 and 2002 ( Oishi 2001, Oishi 2002a )  have  shown a decrease in the number of spermatozoids in the testis of the juvenile rat with propylparaben and butylparaben ( Oishi 2002b ). No effect was observed following administration of methyl or ethylparaben. An additional study, conducted according to good laboratory practices, was conducted with butylparaben and showed no testicular effects in the juvenile rat ( Hoberman 2008 ).

Review and analysis of the above-mentioned literature has been performed by two independent and recognized experts (Prof. Jacques Descotes and Dr. Richard Lee) and have been submitted.

In humans, the main risk related to the use of parabens is sensitization occurring when medications containing  parabens  are  applied  to  the  damaged  or  broken  skin.  Parabens  have  been  implicated  in numerous cases of contact sensitivity associated with cutaneous exposure, but high concentrations of 5-15% in patch testing are needed to elicit reaction in susceptible individuals. Allergic reactions to ingested  parabens  have  been  reported,  although  rigorous  evidence  of  the  allergenicity  of  ingested parabens is lacking ( Soni 2001 ).

Review  of  the  available  data  on  the  potential  reproductive  toxicity  of  parabens  in  animals  and  in humans have raised some concerns about the potential health risk, although it is questionable whether these concerns have any relevance to human exposure ( Hoberman 2008).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To assess this potential health risk of propylparaben contained in Vedrop, different parameters should be taken into consideration, including maximal daily intake of propylparaben, treatment duration with Vedrop and therapeutic alternatives.

First of all, the recommended total daily dose in paediatric patients suffering from cystic fibrosis is 0.13 ml/kg/day (6.7 mg/kg of d-alpha-tocopherol in the form of tocofersolan). The total daily dose is limited to 6.7 ml solution per day (335 mg of d-alpha-tocopherol) for patients weighing 50 kg or more according  to  current  clinical  practice  in  the  management  of  cystic  fibrosis.  In  other  words,  in  this indication,  the  maximum  daily  dose  of  propylparaben  administered  is  6  mg,  equivalent  to  0.12 mg/kg/day (6.7 ml of Vedrop with 0.09% of propylparaben for a child of 50 kg).

The recommended total daily dose in paediatric patients suffering from chronic cholestasis (usually very young, mostly between 0 and 3 years of age), is 0.34 ml/kg/day (17 mg/kg of d-alpha-tocopherol in the form of tocofersolan). The dose should be adjusted according to plasma vitamin E level. The maximum daily dose of propylparaben is 4.5 mg equivalent to 0.3 mg/kg/day (5.1 ml Vedrop for a child of 15 kg).

Secondly,  the  treatment  duration  with  Vedrop  is  limited.  Indeed,  children  with  congenital  chronic cholestasis  or  hereditary  chronic  cholestasis  are  diagnosed  very  early  after  birth.  They  rapidly  go through porto-enteral derivation surgery (Kasai procedure) in order to rebuild the bile duct. If surgery fails (around 50% of cases), liver transplantation is performed as soon as possible (usually long before one year of age). The administration of vitamin E as Vedrop will only occur when the biliary duct is not successfully restored, meaning that longer administration of this medicinal product is restricted to children in whom the Kasai procedure has failed and who have not yet received a liver transplantation. Therefore, the duration of the treatment is around 6 months in this population.

For children with cystic fibrosis, Vedrop is indicated between 0 and 6 years of age because it is a liquid formulation. At 7 years old, children can usually swallow and have capsules of vitamin E. So the total duration can last up to 6 years.

Finally, there is no available approved oral solution of water-soluble vitamin E in the EU. In other words, there is no alternative treatment to Vedrop.

In conclusion, in the applicant`s opinion exposure to propylparaben contained in Vedrop should not be considered as a cause for concern since it will be a limited exposure (low daily intake and limited duration of treatment). Furthermore, there is the lack of therapeutic alternative. Finally, the applicant highlights  that  the  EMEA/CHMP  Paediatric  Working  Party  identified  pegylated  vitamin  E  for  the treatment  of  vitamin  E  deficiency  in  chronic  cholestasis  as  one  of  the  needs  for  research  and development of medicinal products for children.

Ground  for  re-examination  2:  The  composition  of  the  clinical  trial  batches  has  not  been sufficiently  characterised in terms of active species and impurities, and it was not established whether the impurities had been adequately identified and qualified

## Applicant`s position

The active species and impurities were not part of the specifications set in Eastman's DMF, the active ingredient  manufacturer.  As  requested  during  the  previous  evaluation,  the  composition  in  active species of the clinical batches was asked to Eastman by Orphan Europe.

The composition of the two tocofersolan batches used in the Vedrop clinical batches of the Orphan Europe  clinical  trials  were  eventually  obtained  the  day  before  the  oral  explanation  held  on  15th December 2008.

The content in active species as monoester, diester, free PEG and impurities were indicated and the availability of this information was orally presented to the CHMP during the oral explanation held in January 2009. Eastman also gave the composition of the tocofersolan batches intended for marketing. The chain length of PEG was confirmed by Eastman (n=22 to 24) with a molecular mass of 950-1050.

All  these  batches  are  consistent  regarding  the  analytical  results  obtained  on  the  active  species  and impurities  and  compliant  with  the  specifications  of  the  European  Food  Safety  Authorities  (EFSA) report on TPGS.

Regarding the impurities and according to the recent results obtained, Orphan Europe is able to lower the  specifications  of  7  out  of  the  11  known  impurities  below  the  ICH  qualification  level  of  0.15%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(impurities 2-8-10-12-13-14 and 15 mentioned in the specifications of the active substance in Ground 3).

Two other specifications of impurities (impurities 6 and 9, Propionate ester of TPGS monoester and Ethyl ester of tocopheryl succinate) were also lowered below the specifications of the EFSA report from 1.5% to 1.0%.

Regarding the two last impurities (impurities 4 and 3 PEG ester of succinic acid ester of TPGS and succinic  acid  ester  of  TPGS  monoester),  specifications  were  maintained,  respectively  at  0.25%  and 2%. Moreover, a toxicological expert, Dr D.Marzin (Institut Pasteur de Lille) assessed the impurities of  tocofersolan  (those  mentioned  in  the  EFSA  report)  and  according  to  their  structure  and  their metabolism, concluded that none of the impurities of the EFSA report has a toxicological concern at the specification level of the EFSA report.

The EFSA limits were established for a daily dose of tocofersolan of about 3 g for a 50 kg child i.e. about 2 to 3 fold the maximum daily dose of 1.2 g of tocofersolan proposed by Orphan Europe. This means  that  the  maximum  daily  dose  of  tocofersolan  is  0.024  g/kg/day  below  the  NOAEL  of 1g/kg/day.

The  impurities  that  are  mentioned  are  oxidized  form  of  tocopherol,  ester  succinic  acid  of  TPGS, propionate ester of TPGS that could be mainly hydrolysed by esterases in plasma into succinic acid, tocopherol or its derivatives (which are endogenous products), and PEG 1000 at a concentration with no toxicological concern.

## Ground for  re-examination  3:  The  specification  of  the  active  substance  and  finished  product should be revised and updated batch analysis data for the active substance and finished product should have been resubmitted according to the revised specifications

## Applicant`s position

The revised sets of specifications are available for the active substance and for the finished product according  to  the  tests  and  limits  discussed  in  the  Day  180  List  of  Outstanding  issues  responses. Furthermore, all the methods mentioned have been validated.

Regarding the active substance, the base was the Eastman's ASMF. Some other tests were added in accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  CHMP  during  the  assessment  procedure  and  the  data communicated  by  Eastman  to  Orphan  Europe  the  day  before  the  oral  explanation  held  on  15th December.

Then, tests  as assay  of active  species (monoester,  diester),  free  PEG,  sulfated ashes,  water  content, succinic acid and 11 other impurities were added.

Those  impurities  with  results  on  batches  were  communicated  by  Eastman  the  day  before  the  oral explanation and mentioned only orally to the CHMP.

Those impurities which specifications were set based on Eastman's specifications were lowered in a way to be the more possible in accordance with the ICH Q3A guideline, concerning the qualification threshold of 0.15%.

As mentioned in the previous response, 8 impurities out of 12 were compliant with this specification, 2 other  were  lowered  below  the  Eastman's  specifications  (impurities  6  and  9)  and  2  other  were maintained  at  the  same  specification  (impurities  4  and  3).  None  of  these  impurities  present  a toxicological concern.

Regarding the finished product, the assay of the tocofersolan, of tocopherol and the products involved in the composition  of tocofersolan (monoester  of TPGS,  diester of TPGS)  are  tested.  The specifications of the preservatives at a lower limit of 95% ensure a good efficacy of the antimicrobial system. Osmolality is controlled. The impurities have been lowered to acceptable levels.

## Ground for re-examination 4: The demonstration of PK and clinical efficacy in patients with cystic fibrosis was insufficient

## Applicant`s position

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In cystic fibrosis (CF), though alternative formulations exist on various European markets the situation remains heterogeneous and in most markets no drinkable water-soluble formulation of vitamin E is available.  Consequently,  either  liposoluble  formulations,  or  tablets  or  capsules,  or  if  possible  a drinkable suspension are used (e.g. under a Named Patient program -'ATU' - in France). This latter preparation is used because there is a clear unmet medical need in the CF population of young children who cannot easily swallow capsules or tablets. However, such programme, i.e. provision of drug under Named Patient Use should be limited in time. Alternatively, preparations of the vitamin together with other oligo-elements are made available through Internet purchasing system. In the applicant`s opinion this does not constitute a controlled and adequate way of marketing products, lobbying initiatives from providers settled as off-shore companies towards CF-patients' associations are undertaken because of the unmet medical need.

Bioequivalence was tested only in healthy volunteers (HV). Data in children with CF or with chronic cholestasis (CC) were only complementary and should not be regarded as bioequivalence tests.

Pharmacokinetics  (PK)  calculations  to  test  bioequivalence  in  HV  were  appropriate  to  compare products  of  different  powerfulness.  By  similarity  to  calculations  in  HV,  plasma  concentrations  and AUC were divided by the dose, and appropriate statistical tests (Anova and non parametric) carried out to evaluate the difference between the two formulations in respective children populations. This was  recently  accepted  for  publication  in  a  peer  reviewed  journal  of  pharmacology.  This  cannot constitute a methodological drawback specifically in CF children. Moreover PK data either in CF or in CC were not presented as efficacy data.

## Ground for re-examination 5: There was insufficient evidence that the formulation of the investigational product was the same as Vedrop intended for marketing

## Applicant`s position

Clinical  studies  submitted  in  support  of  the  CC  indication  were  performed  15-20  years  ago  and 'bridging' data was requested. The Applicant has made every effort to retrieve and explain the nonavailability of bridging data between Vedrop and the TPGS formulations used in studies considered as 'pivotal' for the demonstration of its biological and clinical efficacy.

No proof could be provided that the quality of the investigational product was the same as Vedrop. Conversely,  it  is  likely  to  be  different  as  the  initial  formulation  of  the  investigational  product  was made in a hospital pharmacy with no information of stability of the product or storage conditions.

Comparisons of past oral vitamin E tolerance test results and those obtained in the applicant's own sponsored study (BIOEQPED 2006) show indirect evidence that the biological results were similar in both  studies.  Personally-owned  data  from  R.J.  Sokol  were  also  provided  to  highlight  the  PK similarities between various formulations that he had used during the clinical investigation of TPGS.

Information on biological indexes under Vedrop in the CC population as data from the Named Patient

Use program was provided. As compared to TPGS used in the 'pivotal' studies, they objectivised similar results with these different preparations, constituting indirect bridging data.

In conclusion, direct bridging data remain inaccessible as the quality of the initial product is unknown; there is no stock of this product and even the producing Companies no longer exist.

## Report from the Ad-hoc Expert meeting on Vedrop re-examination

Following the request from the applicant, as agreed by the CHMP, an Ad-hoc Expert meeting has been convened on 12 May 2009 to provide comments on the grounds for negative opinion and advice on the list of questions raised by the CHMP and adopted during the April 2009 CHMP meeting.

The recommendations from the Ad-hoc expert group on these CHMP questions were:

- The expert  group  was  asked  to  comment  on  whether  the  inclusion  of  propylparaben  in  the proposed  paediatric  formulation  at  the  level  proposed  has  been  sufficiently  justified  and  is acceptable. The expert group was also asked to comment if administration at a maximum daily dose of 6 mg of propylparaben is acceptable in children of all age groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The majority of experts were of the opinion that the propylparaben level is adequately justified, and that it may be considered acceptable in the light of the clinical need for the product in the small target population. It was also specified that Vedrop posology corresponds with a 5.36 mg PP maximum daily dose for a 50 kg patient in CF, and a 0.272 mg/kg/day propylparaben in the indication for CC.

The propylparaben level is higher than normally used, but as they see it there are no public health safety reasons to refuse the use of this specific product based on currently available data. When clear recommendations  become  available  based  on  future  toxicology  data,  the  list  of  all  propylparaben containing products may have to be reviewed in its entirety at that point in time.

However  because  of  the  lack  of  adequate  juvenile  study  especially  assessing  the  risk  of  testicular toxicity of propylparaben there is a potential safety concern for this specific product that will be used long term in neonates. It was not considered appropriate or feasible to ask for clinical follow up of fertility but the need for a juvenile study in neonatal animals (e.g. as a post-marketing commitment as part  of  the  RMP)  was  suggested  in  view  of  the  high  propylparaben  level  for  use  in  the  low-age population.

In  conclusion,  the  expert  group  considered  that  the  propylparaben  content  in  Vedrop  is  acceptable provided a non clinical study in juvenile animals is performed. A protocol would have to be submitted and the proposed age range of the studied animals justified to address the concern in the lower age range population. This study could be performed post approval as a post-marketing commitment.

- The  expert  group  was  asked  to  comment  on  whether  the  composition  of  the  clinical  trial batches has been sufficiently characterised in terms of active species and impurities, whether the impurities had been adequately identified and qualified and whether there was sufficient evidence that the formulation of the investigational product was the same as Vedrop intended for marketing.

It was noted that impurities have been adequately identified and qualified; therefore from the quality point of view there are no concerns.

From the toxicology point of view there are also no concerns regarding these impurities.

It was agreed that the limits of the active moieties should be tightened around the results of the clinical batches and this issue should be addressed before a decision on the licence is taken.

- The  expert  group  is  asked  to  comment  on  whether  the  PK  data  provided  and  the  clinical efficacy demonstrated in patients with cystic fibrosis is sufficient

According  to  the  experts  the  PK  data  provided  are  not  adequate;  concerns  raised  were  that  the measured  levels  of  Vitamin  E  in  plasma  in  pretreated  patients  (at  baseline)  showed  a  tendency  to decrease over time when on treatment with Vedrop; although not a formal comparison, the plasma levels achieved with Vedrop were much lower than with the Cambridge product; in the absence of an untreated  control  (subjects  on  a  Vitamin  E-containing  diet)  the  meaningfulness  of  the  increase  in plasma levels under Vedrop treatment were not entirely clear; patient numbers studied are low, and variability is high which significantly reduce the robustness of the study results.

The  experts  agreed  that  clinical  efficacy  in  patients  with  cystic  fibrosis  has  not  been  demonstrated since  no  assessment  of  possible  clinically  relevant  outcome  (e.g.  nerve  function)  was  available. Furthermore, it was considered, that for CF in general there may not be a general unmet medical need (even  considering  countries  where  the  Cambridge  formulation  is  not  available),  since  in  CF  the improvements in adequate substitution with pancreatic enzymes have improved the situation, adequate nutrition  was  of  prominent  importance,  and  a  general  deficiency  and  need  for  substitution  of  fatsoluble vitamins, including Vitamin E, in all CF patients is questionable.

In conclusion the beneficial effect of Vedrop in CF patients has not been demonstrated.

After the expert meeting the applicant decided to withdraw the indication for cystic fibrosis patients and submitted revised Product information, RMP and revised specifications for the active substance and finished product

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## CHMP position on the Grounds for re-examination

## CHMP position on Ground for re-examination no 1 (Propylparaben)

The antimicrobial preservative system used in Vedrop combines three preservatives selected for their well known antimicrobial and antifungal efficacy in order for the product to meet the requirement of the  Ph.Eur.  for  preservative  efficacy.  The  combination  of  propylparaben  /  methylparaben  is  widely used  as  being  known  to  be  the  most  effective  antimicrobial  system  against  moulds  and  bacteria. Despite  propylparaben  not  being  used  in  food  it  can  be  said  that  propylparaben  is  widely  used  in medicines, including products used in the paediatric population.

Vedrop posology corresponds with a 5.36 mg propylparaben maximum daily dose for a 50 kg patient in CF, and a 0.272 mg/kg/day propylparaben in the indication for CC. On this basis CHMP considers that a refusal of the MA on the basis of propylparaben content is not justified.

The  propylparaben  level  is  higher  than  normally  used,  but  is  certainly  not  the  highest  (when considering daily intake). Moreover, there are no public health safety reasons to refuse the use of this specific product based on currently available data.

Taking  into  account  the  lack  of  adequate  juvenile  study  especially  assessing  the  risk  of  testicular toxicity of propylparaben there is a potential safety concern for this specific product that will be used long  term  in  neonates.  Therefore,  it  was  not  considered  appropriate  or  feasible  to  ask  for  clinical follow up of fertility but the need for a juvenile study in neonatal animals was stressed in view of the high propylparaben level for use in the low-age population. In this context, the applicant committed to participate in the consortium of companies working with the AFSSAPS, to assess the potential risk of propylparaben on the reproductive system of the neonatal rat.

CHMP was of the  opinion  that  the  propylparaben  level  is  adequately  justified,  and  that  it  may  be considered acceptable in the light of the clinical need for the product in the small target population.

## CHMP position on ground for re-examination no 2 (active species and impurities)

It was agreed that the limits for impurities proposed by the applicant are marginally outside the ICH qualification limits. Furthermore, a non-clinical expert report dated January 2009 from Daniel Merzin (Institut  Pasteur  de  Lille,  France)  has  been  submitted.  This  report  did  not  highlight  any  concerns regarding the initial higher impurity limits (apart from succinic acid ester of TPGS monoester which has  now  been  increased  from  1.5%  (level  of  evaluation)  to  2%.  Moreover,  a  document  from  the European Food and Safety Agency (EFSA) states that 'the use of TPGS in foods for special medical purposes  is  not  a  safety  concern  at  the  anticipated  exposure  level  51.7-64.5  mg/Kg/bw/day  but  is contraindicated in children with severe impairment of kidney function'

It  can  be  concluded  that  the  aspects  of  identification  and  qualification  of  impurities  are  adequately resolved.

## CHMP position on ground for re-examination no 3 (revised specifications of the active substance and finished product and updated batch analysis data according to the revised specifications)

It was noted that the active substance testing at different stages have been harmonised and assay limits tightened around clinical trial results.

The  Specifications  of  the  active  substance  and  finished  product  have  been  revised  accordingly. Furthermore, the Applicant has agreed to submit the updated batch analysis data (active substance and finished product) as a FUM.

## CHMP position on ground for re-examination no 4 (PK data and demonstration of clinical efficacy in patients with cystic fibrosis insufficient)

The results of PK studies in HV and patients with CF showed that the absorption of the pegylated d α tocopherol (tocofersolan) is not better than that of the α dl  tocopherol (Cambridge reference), when equal doses in IUs (100 IU) were compared.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The results of an open six months maintenance study in paediatric patients with CF, in which their previous  vitamin  E  treatment  was  switched  to  Vedrop,  are  open  to  criticism.  The  trial  was uncontrolled ; 5 various vitamin E preparations were used as prior treatment, the dose of tocofersolan was 6,7 mg/kg/day but in the 'first phase' of the study it was individualized (2,4 mg/kg/day - 21,4 mg/kg/day).

The results at three and six month post-switch show a slight downward trend with mean vitamin E levels of ≈ 25,  24.5, 23 µ mol/L at baseline, three months and six months respectively. Further time points could clarify whether this trend was real or a chance finding.

In any case the results suggest, that switching patients from other vitamin E formulations to Vedrop at least  at  the  recommended  dose (6,7  mg/kg/day)  in  patients  with  CF  may  result  in  worse  vitamin  E supplementation than when using other available products.

In  conclusion,  the  CHMP  agreed  with  the  experts`  recommendation  that  the  beneficial  effect  of Vedrop has not been demonstrated in CF patients.

CHMP position on Ground for re-examination no 5 (insufficient evidence that the formulation of the investigational product was the same as Vedrop intended for marketing)

Direct  bridging  data between  Vedrop  and  the  TPGS  formulations  used  in  studies  considered  as 'pivotal' for the demonstration of its biological and clinical efficacy is not available. The formulations used  in  the  early  scientific  evaluation  of  the  biology  of  vitamin  E  were  of  an  extemporaneous  or magisterial  nature  and  a  link  to  them  cannot  be  expected.  The  Applicant  has  argued  that  similar biological  results  were  obtained  in  the  studies  with  both  formulations,  i.e.  essentially  'indirect' bridging data.

When  the  totality  of  the  available  data  is  considered,  sufficient  information  is  known  about  the efficacy of this product and its mechanism of action to recommend it for approval in the absence of more specific bridging data between developmental formulations .

## Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination and updated benefit/risk assessment

## Quality

Taking into consideration the initial data submitted and the additional  clarification presented by the Applicant  with the  detailed  grounds  of  re-examination  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  Information  on development,  manufacture,  control  of  the  active  substance  and  the  finished  product  have  been presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner  and  justified  in  accordance  with  relevant  CHMP  and  ICH guidelines.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of  the finished product. Therefore, this medicinal product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. The previous major outstanding issues regarding the quality of the active substance and finished product have been resolved. It was noticed that the Applicant has revised the specification of the active substance and finished product. Moreover, an updated batch analysis data for  the  active  substance  and  finished  product  will  be  submitted  as  a  FUM  according  to the  revised specifications.

The Applicant has provided the relevant  information  regarding  the composition  of the clinical  trial batches in terms of the quantities of active species present and with regard to impurities present.

The impurities presented in the active substance have been adequately identified and qualified; from the quality and toxicology point of view there are no concerns.

It  was  noted  that  the  limits  of  the  active  moieties  were  tightened  around  the  results  of  the  clinical batches. All concerns regarding the uncertainty of the similarity between clinical trial batches and the finished product intended for commercialisation have been clarified.

CHMP decided that the  propylparaben  level  is  adequately  justified,  and  that  it  may  be  considered acceptable in the light of the clinical need for the product in the small target population. Furthermore, it was noticed that there are other medicines, which are already on the EU market that have a higher daily  intake  of  this  particular  preservative.  However,  a  non  clinical  study  in  juvenile  animals (neonates)  with  propylparaben  should  be  performed.  In  this  context,  the  Applicant  committed  to participate in the consortium of companies working with the AFSSAPS, to assess the potential risk of propylparaben on the reproductive system of the neonatal rat.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In conclusion it can be confirmed that the quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there some minor unresolved quality issues, which  do  not  have  any  impact  on  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of  the  medicinal  product.  These  will  be addressed as part of the follow-up measures to be addressed post-authorisation.

## Efficacy

Tocofersolan  has  been  shown  to  be  effective  in  correcting  blood  vitamin  E  levels  in  patients presenting with lipid malabsorption due to chronic cholestasis.  From the historical data submitted, tocofersolan  may  be  effective  in  correcting  or  preventing  neurological  symptoms  in  patients  with congenital chronic cholestasis.  The extent of regression of neurological symptoms depends on the age of  the  patients  and  the  duration  of  malabsorption.    Tocofersolan  seems  effective  in  preventing neurological complications when given early to patients, preferably before the age of 3 years.

Plasma vitamin E levels should be monitored and the dose adjusted accordingly if necessary (see SPC 4.2 Posology and administration).

The demonstration of efficacy, both clinically and biochemically (pharmacokinetics), in patients with cystic fibrosis is insufficient.

## Safety

Experience concerning the clinical safety of tocofersolan is mainly based on published papers in the literature (in 27 healthy volunteers and 116 patients) and on the Applicant's sponsored studies (in 12 healthy volunteers and 42 patients).

Tocofersolan is taken  up by  cells  as  the  intact  molecule,  hydrolyzed  intra-cellularly  and  the  alphatocopherol  moiety  then  appears  in  chylomicrons  in  the  lymph  in  a  manner  identical  to  vitamin  E absorbed from the diet as shown in vitro . The other constituent of Vedrop, Polyethylene Glycol 1000, does not contribute to the pharmacological action of Vedrop. It only acts as a vector of vitamin E to its intestinal absorption sites ( i.e. the apical membrane of the enterocytes) in cases where physiological lipo-solubilizing agents are missing because of an underlying disease. Nephrotoxicity is an established adverse effect of glycols, particularly small glycol molecules, e.g. ethylene and diethylene glycol or low-molecular-weight PEG. Results from animal and human studies appear not to substantiate this risk with  regard  to  the  high-molecular-weight  PEG  1000.  An  appropriate  precautionary  statement  was included in the product information (SPC section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use)

Overall, adverse effects seen with tocofersolan therapy appear to be not serious, are mostly related to the gastrointestinal tract (diarrhoea), and are often dose-related. Although vitamin E and tocofersolan have  been  used  as  supplements  in  many  patients  over  many  years,  data  from  controlled  trials  are sparse. Due to limited data and lack of systematic controlled studies, no definite conclusions can be drawn regarding drug-drug interactions or other interactions.  However, available evidence indicates that tocofersolan, due to inhibition of P-Glycoprotein transporter, may enhance intestinal absorption of other concomitant fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) or that of highly lipophilic medicinal products (see SPC section 4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction).

Vedrop contains propylparaben (0.08 %). As information on the preclinical toxicity of propylparaben on the reproductive system is lacking, a preclinical study in neonatal animals is needed in view of the high propylparaben level for use in the low-age population. In this context, the Applicant committed to participate in the consortium of companies working with the AFSSAPS, to assess the potential risk of Propylparaben on the reproductive system of the neonatal rat.

## Risk-benefit assessment

Please  also  refer  to  section  3.6  for  the  initial  risk-benefit  discussion.  Since  then  the  Applicant  has withdrawn the application for the indication cystic fibrosis.

During the re-examination procedure the risk-benefit of Vedrop in congenital chronic cholestasis or hereditary chronic cholestasis was confirmed to be positive. The CHMP was of the opinion that the propylparaben level is adequately justified, and is acceptable in the light of the clinical need for the product in the small target population. Therefore, considering the unmet medical need of the product in young children with congenital chronic cholestasis or hereditary chronic cholestasis, this indication can be accepted with the conditions laid down in the SPC, i.e. monitoring of vitamin E levels (SPC 4.2), a warning for drug-drug interactions and a precautionary statement regarding potential for renal toxicity due to PEG (SPC 4.4).

Based on the limited amount of preclinical and clinical data available (due to the rarity of the disease), this indication can be approved under exceptional circumstances. In this respect, as requested by the CHMP, the applicant has committed to provide further data post-authorisation, as specific obligations, which will form the basis of an annual re-assessment of the benefit/risk profile of Vedrop:

- Non-clinical: The applicant commits on the principle to participate to the consortium of companies working with the AFSSAPS to assess the potential risk of propylparaben on the reproductive system of the neonatal rat.

-  Clinical:  In  the  frame  of  the  RMP,  the  applicant  will  set  up  a  registry  in  patients  with  congenital chronic cholestasis or hereditary chronic cholestasis.

An updated risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

-  pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns.
-  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

## Recommendation following re-examination

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Vedrop  in  the  treatment  of  vitamin  E  deficiency  due  to digestive  malabsorption  in  paediatric  patients  suffering  from  congenital  chronic  cholestasis  or hereditary  chronic  cholestasis  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances.
