## Introduction

Sprycel (dasatinib) is a potent inhibitor of the BCR-ABL kinase and SRC family kinases along with a number of other selected oncogenic kinases including c-KIT, ephrin (EPH) receptor kinases, and PDGF β receptor. The Marketing Authorisation was granted in November 2006 for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated or blast phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib mesylate, and also for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and lymphoid blast CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.

At the time of the CHMP opinion in September 2006, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) made a commitment (FUM 010) to provide data post-authorisation from two Phase 3 studies comparing the efficacy and safety of dasatinib administered once daily (QD) versus twice daily (BID) in subjects with chronic (CA180034) and advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL (CA180035).

- FUM 010: 'The proposed posology should be reassessed when results of studies CA180034 and CA 180035 are available. Final Clinical Study Report (24 months follow-up) by June 2009 .'

The MAH has now applied for a type II variation to update sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 4.9 and 5.1 of the SPC in line with the first results at 6 months of follow-up of the ongoing studies CA180034 and CA 180035, which are both conducted in accordance with current GCP standards.

Further, the MAH takes the opportunity to update section 4.8 of the SPC in line with the outcome of the CHMP assessment of the 1 st PSUR and according to MedDRA version 8.2. The Package Leaflet has been amended accordingly. In addition, the MAH have implemented some minor editorial changes in the annexes and updated the contact details of the local representatives for Romania and Denmark in the Package Leaflet.

## Clinical Efficacy

## -Main studies

This application is based upon two Phase 3 studies comparing the efficacy of dasatinib administered once daily (QD) versus twice daily (BID) (current posology) in subjects with chronic phase CML (CA180034) and advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL (CA180035) (Table 1).

## -Methods

CA180034 is a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study with a 2 by 2 design comparing 2 doses (100 mg and 140 mg) and 2 schedules (QD and BID) of dasatinib in subjects with chronic phase CML. Subjects with chronic phase CML previously treated with imatinib were enrolled in this study. The primary endpoint was the rate of major cytogenetic response (MCyR) with minimum follow-up of 6 months in subjects resistant to imatinib.

CA180035 is a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study comparing the schedule of dasatinib treatment (i.e., 140 mg QD vs. 70 mg BID) in subjects with advanced (accelerated and blast) phase CML and Ph+ ALL. Subjects with accelerated phase CML, blast phase (myeloid and lymphoid) CML, and Ph+ ALL resistant or intolerant to imatinib were enrolled in this study. The primary endpoint was the rate of major haematologic response (MaHR) in all randomized subjects.

All endpoints for the Phase 3 studies are listed in Table 2. Enrolment is closed in these 2 studies although treatment is ongoing, and subjects are being followed for up to 2 years. (1 = primary endpoint; 2 = secondary endpoint)

Unlike subjects with chronic phase CML, late-stage advanced CML subjects frequently present with fibrotic or hypocellular bone marrow. This results in inadequate baseline bone marrow data and subjects who are unevaluable for response. Similarly, bone marrow reserves in these subjects may be largely exhausted, resulting in an inability to reconstitute normal hematopoietic elements. For these reasons, response rates in advanced stage subjects are presented primarily as hematologic responses, such as MaHR and complete haematologic response (CHR) rates (normalization of all peripheral blood counts), in addition to complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) rates, and no evidence of leukemia ([NEL]; absence of Ph+ metaphases on cytogenetic evaluation with persistent cytopenias on peripheral blood counts.

## -Results

## Study CA180034

In the efficacy cohort for CA180034, 724 subjects were enrolled and 670 were randomized (498 imatinib-resistant, according to the assessment on the baseline case report form, and 172 imatinib-intolerant). Subjects had about a 4.5-year history of CML and most were treated with imatinib for more than 1 year. Pretreatment characteristics were similar between the 4 treatment groups (Table 3).

In CA180034 (Table 4), there were limited differences in efficacy between the 4 treatment groups. The MCyR ranged from 59% for the 100 mg QD dose to 54% for the 50 mg BID group. There was no difference in progression-free survival between the treatment groups (Figure 1). Overall survival was similar between the 4 treatment groups.

## Progression-free Survival: Imatinib-resistant Subjects by

Figure 1: Treatment Group (CA180034)

Source:  CA180034 Clinical Study Report

The trial was powered (80%) to demonstrate that the QD MCyR rate was non-inferior to the BID MCyR rate in imatinib-resistant subjects (if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the QD-BID difference in MCyR rates &gt; -15%). The difference in MCyR between the QD and BID schedule in imatinib-resistant subjects was +2.8% (95% CI: -6.0%, +11.6%) (Table 5). Thus, the QD schedule demonstrated a MCyR rate that was non-inferior to the BID schedule. Within the QD group, there was no evidence of a dose response.

The main secondary objective was achieved as imatinib-resistant subjects in the 100 mg total daily dose (TDD) group attained a MCyR rate that was non-inferior to the 140 mg TDD group. The difference in MCyR between the 100 mg TDD and 140 mg TDD in imatinib-resistant subjects was 0.8% (95% CI:  -9.6% to +8.0%) (Table 6).

## Study CA180035

In the efficacy cohort for CA180035, 638 subjects with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL were enrolled and 611 were randomized (478 imatinib-resistant, according to the assessment on the baseline case report form, and 133 imatinib-intolerant). Subjects had about a 4-year history of CML and were generally treated with imatinib for more than 1 year (Table 7). Overall, there were few differences in pretreatment characteristics.

Efficacy analysis pooled across disease phase showed that the QD schedule was similar to the BID schedule in hematologic responses and cytogenetic responses (Table 8). Although a similar difference in overall survival was reported in the 2 groups, a greater number of subjects in the QD group than in the BID group progressed or died.

The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of dasatinib when administered to all randomized subjects at 140 mg QD relative to 70 mg BID. The QD schedule would be considered similar (non-inferior) to the BID schedule if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the difference in major hematologic response rates was ≥ -12%. The analysis in all randomized subjects showed that the QD schedule was similar (non-inferior) to the BID schedule in major hematologic response rates (Table 9). The QD and BID groups showed little difference in MCyR (37% vs 39%, respectively) with a difference in rate of -2.4%.

Among subjects who achieved a MaHR, durable responses were reported (Figure A).

Figure A: Duration of MaHR in Subjects who Achieved MaHR; All Randomized Subjects (CA180035)

<!-- image -->

The median duration of response was shorter in the QD group vs. the BID group (10.2 months vs. 12.3 months, respectively). Overall, of the subjects with MaHR in the QD group, 30% relapsed compared with 16% in the BID group. When evaluated within each disease phase, the number of subjects who relapsed was similar between the QD and BID groups in subjects with accelerated phase CML and in subjects with myeloid blast phase CML. In subjects with lymphoid blast phase CML or Ph+ ALL, more subjects in the QD group relapsed than in the BID group, which represents 76% (16/21) of the overall difference in progression between the QD and BID groups (Table 10).

The median duration of response was shorter in the QD group vs. the BID group (6.7 months vs. 10.1 months, respectively). Overall, of the subjects with MCyR in the QD group, 40% relapsed compared with 27% in the BID group. The increased progression in the QD group was specific to subjects with blast phase CML (myeloid and lymphoid) or Ph+ ALL (Table 11). In subjects with accelerated phase CML, fewer subjects relapsed in the QD group compared with the BID group.

## Clinical studies in special populations

These analyses include hematologic and cytogenetic endpoints based on age, race, and gender in Studies CA180034 and CA180035 in the efficacy cohort. In CA180034, no consistent response differences were observed among subpopulations of age, race, or gender. In CA180035, fewer subjects over the age of 75 years achieved a MaHR in the QD group compared with the BID group.

## Discussion on Clinical Efficacy

The study design and selected endpoints are all acceptable and in accordance with the agreed FUM 010. Both studies are still ongoing and the final results due in 2009. The provision of these interim results is part of the FUM.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With reference to Study CA180034, an adequate number of patients reflecting the approved indication has been included in the study. From an efficacy point these results clearly support the proposed change in dosing recommendation for patients with chronic phase CML. The results must be considered robust as consistency is found for both primary and secondary endpoints.

In Study CA180035, although non-inferiority was demonstrated for the overall QD versus BID treatment schedule, the secondary endpoints do not unequivocally support this finding. Major differences in duration of response (median time to progression) and deaths favours the current BID dosing for patients with advanced CML or Ph+ ALL. It is agreed with the MAH, that this dose not support a change in dosing posology.

Again the CHMP considers that these data across age, race and gender support the proposed changes in posology for Chronic Phase CML but not for advanced CML or Ph+ ALL.

## Clinical Safety

## -Exposure

The median duration of exposure in subjects with chronic phase CML ranged from 7.9 to 8.3 months (Table 12). The median duration of exposure in subjects with advanced phase disease was ~5.5 months (Table 13).

## -General Safety Results

Safety data reported in CA180034 and CA180035 were similar to results reported in the Phase 2 studies. Adverse events of myelosuppression and fluid retention identified as Adverse Events (AEs) of special interest are further described below.

In CA180034 , similar safety events were reported across the 4 treatment arms. The results from this study demonstrated that treatment with dasatinib 100 mg QD provides a better overall safety profile than the other three doses/schedules. Drug-related AEs occurred less frequently in the 100 mg QD group than in the 70 mg BID group. Similarly, the rates of deaths and serious adverse events (SAEs) were lower in the 100 mg QD group than in the 70 mg BID group. Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was reported less frequently in subjects in the 100 mg QD group than in the 70 mg BID group. The rates of thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia were significantly lower in the 100 mg QD group than in the other 3 groups. Subjects administered a starting dose of 100 mg QD reported significantly fewer pleural effusions than the other 3 groups.

CA180035 The results from this study demonstrated that the QD schedule was better tolerated than the BID schedule. The most important difference between the groups was observed in the rate of fluid retention. Pleural effusion was reported in fewer subjects in the QD group than in the BID group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Similarly, there was a substantial decrease in the incidence of other fluid retention events in the QD vs. BID group. There were small differences in other non-hematologic AEs, some favouring the QD group (nausea and anorexia) and others favouring the BID group (headache). There were minimal differences in myelosuppression, which were severe in both treatment groups. The difference in toxicity resulted in less frequent dose reductions and dose interruptions in the QD group, allowing for a more sustained drug administration.

## -Common Drug-related Adverse Events

Overall, drug-related AEs reported in CA180034 and CA180035 were common to those reported in the Phase 2 studies. In CA180034, drug-related AEs occurred less frequently in the 100 mg QD group (81%) than in the 70 mg BID group (89%). Drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs also occurred less frequently in the 100 mg QD group (30%) than in the 70 mg BID group (48%). In CA180035, drugrelated AEs were similar between the QD group (88%) and BID group (87%).

Of the overall (all clinical trials reported to date) population of 2182 dasatinib-treated subjects, 1864 (85%) experienced at least 1 drug-related AE over the course of the study (Table 14). The most frequently reported ( ≥ 10%) drug-related AEs (all grades combined) of clinical relevance included diarrhea (29%), pleural effusion (17%), and hemorrhage (19%).

## -Serious Adverse Events

Overall, SAEs reported in CA180034 and CA180035 were consistent with the Phase 2 program. In CA180034, SAEs occurred less frequently in the 100 mg QD group (24%) than in the 70 mg BID group (34%). In CA180035, SAEs were similar between the QD group (66%) and BID group (70%).

Of the overall population of 2182 dasatinib-treated subjects, 922 (42%) reported SAEs. The most frequently reported ( ≥ 2%) SAEs included pyrexia, pleural effusion, febrile neutropenia, lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage, pneumonia, infection, sepsis, dyspnea, diarrhea, and cardiac failure. Fluid retention, myelosuppression, bleeding-related events, and QT interval prolongation are further addressed below.

## -Deaths

In CA180034, the death rate was low in subjects with chronic phase CML with fewer deaths in the 100 mg QD group (0%) than in the 70 mg BID group (2%). In CA180035, more deaths in subjects with advanced phase disease were reported in the QD group (36%) than in the BID group (30%). The main difference in deaths between the groups was due to a higher number of deaths attributed to disease in the QD group compared with the BID group.

Three hundred sixty-four of the 2,182 subjects (16.7%) included in this pooled population died; 210 deaths (9.6%) occurred within 30 days after administration of the last dose of dasatinib. The most frequent reasons for deaths were disease progression (8.3%) and infection (3.3%). Twenty-two deaths (1.0%) were due to fatal bleeding.

## -Laboratory Abnormalities

In this heavily pretreated population of subjects, treatment with dasatinib was associated with severe (Grade 3 or 4) thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. Myelosuppression is addressed below as an AE of special interest.

There were few clinically meaningful non-hematologic changes in laboratory parameters reported on treatment with dasatinib in CA180034 and CA180035, a result consistent with the Phase 2 program. Of the overall population of 2182 dasatinib-treated subjects, Grade 3 or Grade 4 non-hematologic laboratory abnormalities included hypophosphemia (12.0%), hypocalcemia (5.4%), elevated SGPT (2.5%), hyperbilirubinemia (1.6%), elevated serum creatinine (1.1%), and elevated SGOT (1.5%).

## -Selected Safety Events

Safety issues of special importance in the dasatinib product label included the AEs of myelosuppression, fluid retention (pleural effusion and pericardial effusion), bleeding-related events, and QT prolongation. There are no new QT prolongation data being reported in this section.

## Study CA180034

The rates of fluid retention-related events reported in CA180034 were lower in the 100 mg QD group than the 70 mg BID group (Table 15). Subjects administered a starting dose of 100 mg QD reported significantly fewer pleural effusions than the other treatment groups.

Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was reported less frequently in subjects in the 100 mg QD group than in the 70 mg BID group (Table 16). The rates of thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia were lower in the 100 mg QD treatment group than in the other treatment groups.

Subjects administered the 100 mg QD dose achieved the highest dose intensity of all the treatment groups.

The average TDD in the 100 mg QD group was close to the target of 100 mg TDD (i.e., 99.5 mg). In contrast, in the 70 mg BID group, the average daily dose was 108 mg/day, a reduction from the target of 140 mg TDD. The rates of dose interruption and reduction were lower in the 100 mg QD group than in the 70 mg BID group. The number of recurrent dose interruptions and reductions was also lowest in the 100 mg QD group, allowing for a more sustained drug administration.

## Study CA180035

Fewer subjects in the QD group than in the BID group reported fluid retention-related AEs of all grades, including pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, pericardial effusion, and CHF (Table 17). There were minimal differences in myelosuppression, which were severe in both treatment groups (Table 18). The difference in toxicity resulted in less frequent dose reductions and dose interruptions in the QD group, allowing for a more sustained drug administration.

## Safety in the Overall Population

In the overall population of 2182 dasatinib-treated subjects, severe (Grade 3/4) fluid retention was reported in 7% of subjects treated with dasatinib, including pleural and pericardial effusion reported in 4% and 1% of subjects, respectively. Severe ascites and generalized edema were each reported in &lt;1%. Severe pulmonary edema was reported in 1% of subjects. Severe pleural effusion may require thoracentesis and oxygen therapy. Fluid retention events were typically managed by supportive care measures that included diuretics and/or short courses of steroids.

Myelosuppression occurred more frequently in subjects with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL than in chronic phase CML. The reported Grade 3 or Grade 4 hematologic abnormalities included neutropenia (57.6%), thrombocytopenia (56.3%), and anemia (35.4%). Myelosuppression was generally reversible and usually managed by withholding dasatinib temporarily or dose reduction.

Overall, severe central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhages, including fatalities, occurred in 1% of subjects receiving dasatinib. Severe gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage occurred in 6% of subjects and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

generally required treatment interruptions and transfusions. Other cases of severe hemorrhage occurred in 3% of subjects. Most bleeding events were associated with severe thrombocytopenia.

## Discussion on Clinical Safety

Safety data from CA180034 supports the change in posology proposed by the MAH in this type II variation. The QD dosing in patients with chronic phase CML resulted in fewer AE's including those most frequently seen with dasatinib in the overall clinical development program. Safety data also supported the QD dosing in patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL, although these results are not as convincing as for patients in chronic phase (study CA180034).

The data from these two phase III studies add to the overall safety database for dasatinib, and the relevant SPC sections have been amended accordingly by the MAH. Further, the MAH has forwarded an updated Risk Management Plan, which is considered acceptable.

## SPC changes as a result of the CHMP assessment of the 1 st PSUR

Following the Committee's assessment of the 1st Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) for dasatinib oral  tablets  (covering  the  period  from  28  June  2006  through  27  December  2006),  the  MAH  was requested to file a type II variation to update the SPC as follows:

- -'The treatment with dasatinib is associated with the important adverse reaction Myelosuppression. In section 4.4. Special warnings and precautions for use it says \"Myelosuppression: treatment with Sprycel is associated with anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia\".  Under section 4.8. only neutropenia is mentioned under blood and lymphatic system disorders. The SPC should be updated to also include anaemia and thrombocytopeniain in section 4.8.
- -The event gastrointestinal haemorrhage is only mentioned in the SPC under the adverse reaction \"Vascular disorders\". Even though most bleeding related events seen in the treatment with dasatinib are associated with severe thrombocytopenia, which encourages that gastrointestinal bleeding is mentioned under this section, several reported bleeding disorders are related to gastrointestinal disorders. It is therefore recommended that gastrointestinal bleeding should be mentioned under this SOC as well. Therefore the SPC should be updated accordingly in section 4.8.
- -The event cerebral haemorrhage is only mentioned in the SPC under the adverse reaction \"Vascular disorders\".  Most bleeding related events seen in the treatment with dasatinib are associated with severe thrombocytopenia, which is already stated in the SPC.  But since several reported bleeding disorders are related to the event cerebral haemorrhage the event should be specified in point 4.8 in the SPC. It is recommended that the SPC should be updated under point 4.8. to specify the event Cerebral haemorrhage under the SOC Nervous system Disorders as well. In point 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC It states \"CNS hemorrhage occurred in 1% of Patients. Three cases were fatal and 2 of them were associated with CTC grade 4 thrombocytopenia…\" The MAH states that 5 fatal cases related to cerebral hemorrhage during the review period, it seems that section 4.4 of the SPC should be updated to include these fatal events. '

The MAH took the opportunity of this type II variation to update section 4.8 of the SPC in line with the outcome of the CHMP assessment of the 1 st PSUR and according to MedDRA version 8.2. The Package Leaflet has been amended accordingly.

## Benefit/risk assessment

Dasatinib offers a therapeutic advance for subjects with CML or Ph+ ALL who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Results from the dasatinib Phase 1 and Phase 2 program showed that subjects with all phases of CML or Ph+ ALL achieve durable hematologic and cytogenetic responses. Myelosuppression and fluid retention were identified as the most important toxicities in the Phase 1

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and Phase 2 studies. Recovery from myelosuppression and fluid retention-related AEs were managed in most cases by dose interruptions, dose reductions, or supportive care.

Previous findings from Phase 1 assessing BID and QD dose regimens among subjects with chronic phase CML, showed similar efficacy with a suggestion of improved safety for the QD regimen; however, the study was not designed to compare dosing schedules. In an attempt to improve the safety profile of dasatinb while maintaining efficacy, Studies CA180034 and CA180035 were undertaken as a post-marketing commitment (FUM 010) to assess alternate doses and regimens to minimize the risk associated with the administration of dasatinib.

Results from the two phase III trials included in this application showed evidence of substantial and durable hematologic and cytogenetic response rates in subjects with chronic phase CML who failed imatinib because of progression or intolerance. These data demonstrate that a dose of 100 mg QD has comparable efficacy with the currently approved dose of 70 mg BID, but were associated with improved and clinically relevant less toxicity. The proposed change in posolgy for chronic phase CML recommending 100 mg QD as starting dose has a more favourable benefit/risk ratio than the current 70 mg BID and should in the opinion of the CHMP be approved.

In subjects with advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL, despite an improvement in the safety profile of dastinib, a recommendation for alternative dosing will require further assessment of the durability of hematologic and cytogenetic responses.

The MAH has forwarded an updated Risk Management Plan, which is considered acceptable.

Both studies (CA180034 and CA180035) are still ongoing and the MAH should still provide the final (24 month) results of both studies when available (FUM 010).

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity of this type II variation to update section 4.8 of the SPC in line with the outcome of the CHMP assessment of the 1 st PSUR and according to MedDRA version 8.2. The Package Leaflet has been amended accordingly. Further, the MAH have implemented some minor editorial changes in the annexes and updated the contact details of the local representatives for Romania and Denmark in the Package Leaflet.

## CONCLUSION

- -On 19 July 2007 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, labelling and Package Leaflet.
