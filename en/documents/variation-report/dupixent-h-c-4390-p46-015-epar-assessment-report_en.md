The MAH stated that study EFC16823 is a stand-alone study and part of a clinical development program.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

- A 150 mg/mL dupilumab solution in a pre-filled syringe to deliver 300 mg in 2 mL
- A 175 mg/mL dupilumab solution in a pre-filled syringe to deliver 200 mg in 1.14 mL
- Matching placebo

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final clinical study report (CSR) for:

- Study EFC16823 entitled A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, parallelgroup study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of dupilumab compared to placebo in Japanese patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) aged 6 months to &lt;18 years whose disease is not adequately controlled with existing therapies
- 2.3.2. Clinical study EFC16823 'A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of dupilumab compared to placebo in Japanese patients with atopic dermatitis aged 6 months to &lt;18 years whose disease is not adequately controlled with existing therapies'

## Description

EFC16823 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study to assess the efficacy, safety, and PK of dupilumab with concomitant topical corticosteroid (TCS) use in Japanese participants aged ≥6 months to &lt;18 years with moderate -to-severe AD whose disease was not adequately controlled with existing therapies. This study is a part of the Japan pediatric clinical development plan for dupilumab in AD.

The first step analysis CSR dated on 30 June 2022 presented the results of all analyses for the 24week IMP intervention period (16-week randomized IMP intervention period and subsequent OLE period) of each participant with the data cut-off date of 09 February 2022 (date of first interim data cut-off). The first step analysis CSR reported the final analyses of primary efficacy of dupilumab compared with placebo during the 16-week double blind randomized IMP intervention period and safety up to Week 24 with dupilumab treatment. The results of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints during the 16-week randomized IMP intervention period and the tertiary/exploratory efficacy endpoints during the OLE period up to Week 24 have been summarized in the first step analysis CSR.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The second step analysis CSR dated on 27 January 2023 presented the results of all analyses for the 52-week IMP intervention period of each participant with the data cut-off date of 24 August 2022 (date of second interim data cut-off), along with the results of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints during the 16-week double blind randomized IMP intervention period from the first step analysis CSR.

In the second step analysis CSR, the results of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints during the randomized IMP intervention period were reiterated from the first step analysis CSR, and the updated data on the tertiary/exploratory efficacy endpoints up to Week 32 (the last evaluation time point specified in the protocol) for peak pruritus NRS, worst itch NRS, worst scratch/itch NRS, CDLQI, and IDQOL, or Week 52 for EASI, IGA, and percent BSA affected by AD were provided.

This final analysis CSR reports the results of all analyses for the IMP intervention period (16-week randomized IMP intervention period and OLE period) and subsequent safety follow-up, along with the results of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints during the randomized IMP intervention period from the first step analysis CSR. The efficacy analyses were conducted for up to 116 weeks depending on the endpoint.

## Methods

## Study participants

The key inclusion and exclusion criteria for Study EFC16823 are presented below.

Key inclusion criteria:

- Participants were Japanese and ≥6 months to &lt;18 years of age, at the time of signing the informed consent and/or assent.
- Participants who had diagnosis of AD according to the American Academy of Dermatology consensus criteria at screening visit.
- Chronic AD diagnosed at least 1 year prior to the screening visit (for participants between 6 months to &lt;1 year of age, the requirement was to have had chronic AD for 3 months).
- IGA ≥3 and EASI ≥16 at screening and baseline visits.
- Baseline peak pruritus NRS average score for maximum itch intensity ≥4 for participants ≥12 to &lt;18 years of age.
- Baseline worst itch NRS or worst scratch/itch NRS weekly average score for maximum itch or scratch/itch intensity ≥4 for participants ≥6 months to &lt;12 years of age.
- Body surface area (BSA) of AD involvement &gt;10% at screening and baseline visits.
- With documented recent history (within 6 months before the baseline visit) of inadequate response to topical AD medication(s).

· Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in 16-1-1-protocol [10.1] of the protocol which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in this protocol. Participants ≥6 years of age (or above an age determined by the Institutional Review Board [IRB]) must provide written informed assent form (IAF), and their legally authorized representative must provide written informed consent.

## Key exclusion criteria

- Active chronic or acute infection requiring treatment with systemic antibiotics, antivirals, antiprotozoals, or antifungals within 2 weeks before the baseline visit or during the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

screening period.

- Known or suspected immunodeficiency, including history of invasive opportunistic infections (eg, tuberculosis [TB], histoplasmosis, listeriosis, coccidioidomycosis, pneumocystosis, and aspergillosis) despite infection resolution, or otherwise recurrent infections of abnormal frequency or prolonged duration suggesting an immune compromised status, as judged by the Investigator.

· Participants with active TB or non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection, or a history of incompletely treated TB were excluded from the study unless it was well documented by a specialist that the participant had been adequately treated and could start treatment with a biologic agent, in the medical judgement of the Investigator and/or infectious disease specialist. Tuberculosis testing was performed according to local guidelines of Japan, if required by regulatory authorities or ethics boards.

- Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2 infection or HIV seropositivity at the screening.
- Participants with any of the following result at the screening:
- Positive (or indeterminate) Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) or, - Positive hepatitis B core antibody (HBc Ab) confirmed by positive hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA or,
- Positive hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab) confirmed by positive hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA.

## Design

Study EFC16823 was comprised of the following 3 periods (see Fig. 1):

- Screening period: up to 5 weeks (including the TCS standardization period of 2 weeks)
- Investigational medicinal product intervention period:
- The randomized IMP intervention period (expressed as the randomized treatment period in the analysis): 16 weeks
- The OLE period (all participants switch to active treatment after 16 weeks): until approval of the indication in Japan or for 3 years, whichever was sooner
- Follow-up period (for participants who did not want to continue to the OLE period): 12 weeks

Participants enrolled into Study EFC16823 were randomly assigned (1:1) to the dupilumab group or the placebo group (matching placebo) in the 16-week randomized IMP intervention period.

Dupilumab and placebo dose regimens were as follows:

- Dupilumab 300 mg q2w with 600 mg loading dose for ≥60 kg body weight at baseline
- dupilumab 200 mg q2w with 400 mg loading dose for ≥30 to &lt;60 kg body weight at baseline
- dupilumab 300 mg q4w for ≥15 to &lt;30 kg body weight at baseline
- dupilumab 200 mg q4w for ≥5 to &lt;15 kg body weight at baseline
- Matching placebo

For the OLE period, all participants randomized to the dupilumab group in the randomized IMP intervention period continued the same treatment in the OLE period (the dupilumab/dupilumab group). Participants randomized to the placebo group in the randomized IMP intervention period started to receive the dupilumab treatment in the OLE period, with the dose determined by body weight (the placebo/dupilumab group). During screening, all participants underwent a 2-week TCS standardization

period using a standardized regimen, which could be continued, decreased, or stopped according to the severity of the disease throughout the study. TCS rescue medication was allowed. During the OLE period after Week 32, any class of TCS and topical calcineurin inhibitors could have been used according to the Investigator's discretion and in consultation with the Japanese AD guideline. For participants who declined to enter to the OLE period, the overall duration of the study was approximately 33 weeks (including screening [up to 5 weeks], treatment [16 weeks], and follow-up [12 weeks]). For participants who chose to enter the OLE, the duration of the interventional period was approximately 21 weeks (including screening and treatment) plus an additional 3 years OLE period or until approval of the indication in Japan, whichever was sooner. Approximately 60 participants were planned to be enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to study intervention (dupilumab or placebo in a 1:1 ratio).

## Treatments

The study interventions are outlined in Table 1, and the study arms with associated interventions are described in Table 2. The dupilumab treatment group in the study was a weight-tiered fixed-dose regimen described in Figure 1. Dosing regimen was not changed during the randomized IMP intervention period (until Week 16).

At the time of entering the OLE period (at Week 16) and every in-clinic visit after Week 32, if a participant's body weight exceeded the specific weight (15, 30, or 60 kg) at the previous in-clinic visit, the dosing regimen was to be adjusted to the higher weight regimen. If a participant moved from a higher weight group to a lower weight group for 2 consecutive in-clinic visits, the dose was to be adjusted to the lower weight dose regimen.

## Outcomes/endpoints

See Table 3 above.

## Recruitment

Study initiation date: 15 January 2021

(first participant first visit)

Primary completion date: 09 February 2022

(date of first interim data cut-off)

Study completion date: 28 October 2023

(last participant last visit)

## Sample size

A total of 62 participants were randomized and exposed to the study intervention of either dupilumab or placebo in a 1:1 ratio during the 16-week randomized IMP intervention period (30 in the dupilumab group and 32 in the placebo group).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based upon the data from R668-AD-1526 and R668-AD-1652, R668-AD-1539 part B data were not available at the time we planned our study) where the response rates for placebo and dupilumab arms were weighted averages from the global trials based on the assumed 12-18 year old and 6-11-year-old age groups representation in EFC16823, it assumes the response rate of the proportion of patients achieving EASI-75 after 16 weeks of treatment of 70% and 24% for dupilumab and placebo, respectively. The assumption considers that dupilumab q2w and q4w dosing regimens from R668-AD1652 achieved similar effect sizes for EASI-75 and that the Japan local study is expected to enroll approximately 15% adolescent patients (aged ≥12 to &lt;18 years). Fifty-six patients (60 randomized patients with a 7% drop out rate, which is a similar rate as the global pediatric studies) will ensure 90% power to detect the treatment group difference of 46% in EASI-75 by using Fisher exact test with two-sided alpha of 0.05 (Table 4).

The randomization will be stratified by three age categories (≥6 months to &lt;6 years old, ≥6 years to &lt;12 years old, and ≥12 years). For the age group of ≥6 years to &lt;12 years old, the randomization will be further stratified by IGA of AD (3 vs 4) at baseline. In total, there will be 4 randomization strata.

| Populationwithout trialimpact (disruption) due to COVID-19 | A Population without trial impact (disruption) due to COVID-19 is defined as any participant in randomized population: - without any critical or major deviation related to COVID-19 - andwho didn't permanently discontinue treatment due toCOVID-19 - and who didn't permanently discontinue study duetoCOVID-19                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Participants exposed to study intervention before or without being randomized will not be considered randomized and will not be included in any analysis population. The safety experience of these participants will be reported separately. Randomized participants for whom it is unclear whether they took the study intervention will be considered as exposed and will be included in the safety population as randomized. For any participant randomized more than once, only the data associated with the first randomization will be used in any analysis population. The safety experience associated with any later randomization will be reported separately. For participants who accidentally receive different treatment from the planned, the actual intervention allocation for as-treated analysis will be the dupilumab group. Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, additional summaries by COVID-19 subgroups will be provided to assess the impact of the COVID-19 on treatment effect. Participants impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic are defined as randomized participants with any critical or major deviation related to COVID-19 or who permanently discontinued study intervention or study due to COVID-19.

No information on blinding procedure is included in the dossier.

## Statistical Methods

Responder endpoints will be analyzed using the CMH test adjusted by randomization strata defined as '≥6 months to &lt;6 years, ≥6 years to &lt;12 years old and IGA=3, ≥6 years to &lt;12 years old and IGA=4, and ≥12 years at baseline'. Comparisons of the response rates between dupilum ab and placebo will be derived from these analyses. For participants discontinuing the study treatment before Week 16, their off-study treatment values measured up to Week 16 (if no prohibited medications and/or rescue medications taken prior to the measurement) will be included in the analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Participants taking the prohibited medications and/or rescue medications prior to Week 16 will be considered non-responders for Week 16 analyses. Additionally,

· If a participant discontinues from the study due to AE, lack of efficacy, withdrawal by subject or withdrawal by parent/guardian, this participant will be counted as a nonresponder for the time points after withdrawal.

· If the participant has the missing value at Week 16 due to any other reasons including COVID-19, the data will be imputed using multiple imputation (MI) based on all observed values as described below:

· The underlying continuous (e.g., EASI) or categorical variable (e.g., IGA) will be imputed 40 times to generate 40 complete data sets by using the SAS procedure MI using the following steps.

- Step 1: The monotone missing pattern is induced by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method in MI procedure using seed number 12345. The monotone missing pattern means that if a participant has missing value for a variable at a visit, then the values at all subsequent visits for the same variable are all missing for the participant.

- Step 2: The missing data at subsequent visits will be imputed using the regression method for the monotone pattern with seed number 54321 and adjustment for covariates including treatment groups, randomization strata (≥6 months to &lt;6 years, ≥6 years to &lt;12 years old and IGA=3, ≥6 years to &lt;12 years old and IGA=4, and ≥12 years), and relevant baseline variables. For the categorical variable, such as IGA, a logistic regression under monotone option will be used.

Based on each imputed data, the response status (responder or non-responder) will be determined for each subject. Once imputations are made, the Week 16 data (binary response) of each of the 40 complete datasets will be analyzed using CMH test. The SAS MIANALYZE procedure will be used to

generate valid statistical inferences by combining results from the 40 analyses using Rubin's formula. An appropriate transformation (such as Wilson-Hilferty transformation) of CMH test statistics can be used in Rubin's formula.

## Sensitivity analysis

For the primary estimand for the primary endpoint, no sensitivity analysis will be performed.

However, two supplementary analyses will be performed as described in the section below.

## Supplementary analyses

The following supplementary analyses will be performed:

As-observed analysis (including all data regardless of rescue medication or procedure use)

All observed data regardless of rescue medication or procedure use or data is collected after study withdrawal, will be included for the primary endpoint. Participants with missing values will be counted as non-responders.

## Last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach

The post-baseline LOCF approach after censoring for rescue medication, procedural use, or study withdrawal to determine participant's status at Week 16 will be conducted to assess the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis with regards to handling of missing data. For participants with only baseline value, the baseline value will be carried forward to Week 16.

## Results

## Participant disposition

Of 75 participants screened for study eligibility, 13 participants were screen failures. The most frequent reason for screening failure was not meeting inclusion criterion (EASI ≥16 at screening and baseline visits [I05], 5 [6.7%] of all screened participants). A total of 62 participants were randomized and exposed to the study intervention of either dupilumab or placebo in a 1:1 ratio during the 16-week randomized IMP intervention period (30 in the dupilumab group and 32 in the placebo group). Overall, 60 (96.8%) participants completed the randomized IMP intervention period as planned (28 in the dupilumab group and 32 in the placebo group) and rolled over to the OLE period to receive continued or new treatment with dupilumab. Overall, 57 (91.9%) participants completed the study (27 [90.0%] in the dupilumab/dupilumab group, and 30 [93.8%] in the placebo/dupilumab group). One of the 27 participants in the dupilumab/dupilumab group had permanent study intervention discontination due to a pretreatment AE during the randomized IMP intervention period but continued the study until Week 16 (the end of the planned randomization IMP intervention period), and was considered to have completed the study (Table 6).

## Number analysed

The number of participants included in each analysis population (as defined in the SAP) is provided in Table 9. No participant was excluded from the efficacy population (ITT population) or safety population (both randomized treatment period and dupilumab exposure period). The PK population and the ADA population included 62 participants (30 out of 30 in the dupilumab group and 32 out of 32 in the placebo group). Overall, the population without trial impact (disruption) due to COVID-19 consisted of 61 (98.4%) participants.

## Pharmacology results

The PK, PD, and immunogenicity analyses results in Study EFC16823 are consistent with the known PK, PD, and immunogenicity of dupilumab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetics

In the dupilumab/dupilumab group, following administration of dupilumab 300 mg q2w after an initial loading dose of 600 mg (in participants with body weight ≥60 kg), 200 mg q2w after an initial loading dose of 400 mg (in participants with body weight ≥30 to &lt;60 kg), 300 mg q4w (in participants with body weight ≥15 to &lt;30 kg), or 200 mg q4w (in participants with body weight ≥5 to &lt;15 kg), the trough concentration of functional dupilumab in serum increased over time, reached steady-state between Week 16 and Week 24 and maintained steady throughout Week 116.

## Pharmacodynamics

Consistent with the mechanism of action of dupilumab, a continuous and marked decrease in total IgE concentrations was observed in the dupilumab group throughout the 16-week randomized IMP intervention period, while no notable effects were observed in participants receiving placebo. Further decrease in total IgE concentration in the dupilumab/dupilumab group was observed over time until the end of the study (up to Week 116). A marked decrease of total IgE in serum was also observed after switching IMP at Week 16 from placebo to dupilumab in the placebo/dupilumab group. Additionally, a marked decrease in TARC/CCL17 (a type 2 chemokine whose receptor CCR4 is predominantly expressed on Th2 lymphocytes and basophils) in serum was observed in the dupilumab group as compared with placebo at Week 4 (the first measurement after the start of IMP administration) and thereafter the concentration was sustained at low levels in the dupilumab group up to Week 16 (the last measurement time point specified in the protocol).

## Immunogenicity

During the randomized IMP intervention period, treatment-emergent positive ADA responses were observed in 2 (6.7%) participants in the dupilumab group and 2 (6.3%) participants in the placebo group. Among the participants with treatment-emergent positive ADA responses, all had low titer indeterminate response (for the dupilumab group) or low titer transient response (for the placebo group). Positive neutralizing antibody responses were observed in 1 (3.3%) participant in the dupilumab group as compared with 0 in the placebo group. From Week 16 to Week 116, 1 (3.1%) treatment-emergent positive ADA response was observed in the placebo/dupilumab group, while no treatment-emergent positive ADA responses were observed in the dupilumab/dupilumab group.

Overall, the number of participants with treatment-emergent ADA response was small and no meaningful conclusions on the potential impact of ADA could be drawn.

## Efficacy results

The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with EASI75 (≥75% improvement from baseline) at Week 16 in the ITT population. The proportion of participants achieving EASI75 at Week 16 was higher in the dupilumab group than in the placebo group (43.3% [13/30] versus 18.8% [6/32]). The difference was statistically significant (response rate difference versus placebo: 25.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.26, 46.90]; p=0.0304), see Table 10. Superiority of dupilumab over placebo was therefore demonstrated for the primary endpoint, proportion of participants with EASI-75 at Week 16, in Japanese participants with AD aged 6 months to &lt;18 years whose disease was not adequately controlled with existing therapies.

For comparison, the results of EASI-75 at Week 16, including adolescent participants in study R668AD-1526 and pediatric patients aged ≥6 to &lt;12 years with ≥30 kg in q2w and &lt;30 kg in q4w in study R668-AD-1652, are shown below in Table 11.

The following 3 key secondary endpoints were evaluated as supportive analyses to the primary analysis:

- Percent change in EASI (%EASI) score change from baseline to Week 16

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Percent change from baseline to Week 16 in weekly average of daily worst itch NRS for participants aged ≥6 years to &lt;12 years old
- Proportion of participants with an IGA score of 0 or 1 at Week 16 (5-point scale)

Dupilumab treatment resulted in a reduction from baseline to Week 16 compared with placebo in %EASI (least squares [LS] mean difference in percent change from baseline versus placebo: -39.38% [95% CI: -60.57, -18.19]; p=0.0003) (Table 12) and in weekly average of daily worst itch NRS for participants aged ≥6 years to &lt;12 years old (LS mean difference in percent change from baseline versus placebo: -33.28% [95% CI: -59.15, -7.42]; p=0.0117) (Table 13). There were no betweengroup differences in the proportion of participants with an IGA score of 0 or 1 at Week 16, as the study did not have enough statistical power to demonstrate the difference between groups in this endpoint (Table 14).

In conclusion, dupilumab treatment provided substantial clinical benefit to Japanese participants aged 6 months to &lt;18 years with moderate-to-severe AD on different domains of disease such as intensity and extent of objective AD signs (as measured by EASI, and percent BSA affected by AD), intensity of subjective symptoms (as measured by pruritus NRS and POEM), and quality of life (measured by CDLQI) during the randomized IMP intervention period and OLE period.

## Safety results

## Extent of exposure

The mean (SD) duration of IMP exposure during the randomized IMP intervention period in the safety population was similar between intervention groups (107.4 [21.3] days in the dupilumab group and 112.1 [5.0] days in the p lacebo group). Most (≥86.7%) participants were exposed for ≥16 weeks of treatment with IMP in both intervention groups.

The mean (SD) duration of dupilumab exposure during the dupilumab exposure period (including both the randomized IMP treatment period and the OLE period) in the safety population was 777.9 (181.9) days overall (794.6 [252.0] days in the dupilumab/dupilumab group and 762.3 [72.2] days in the placebo/dupilumab group), with a maximum duration of 954 days. Overall, 47 (75.8%) participants were exposed for ≥104 weeks of treatment with dupilumab (27 [90.0%] in the dupilumab/dupilumab group and 20 [62.5%] in the placebo/dupilumab group) and 33 (53.2%) participants were exposed for ≥116 weeks (20 [66.7%] in the dupilumab/dupilumab group and 13 [40.6%] in the placebo/dupilumab group).

## TEAEs during the randomized IMP intervention period

The proportion of participants with TEAEs was similar between the dupilumab and placebo groups (63.3% [19/30] and 59.4% [19/32], respectively) (Table 15 above). During the randomized IMP intervention period , the most frequently reported TEAEs (in ≥5% of participants in either intervention group) by PT were:

- conjunctivitis allergic (4 [13.3%] in the dupilumab group and 0 [0%] in the placebo group);
- nasopharyngitis (3 [10.0%] and 7 [21.9%], respectively);
- pyrexia (3 [10.0%] and 0 [0%], respectively);
- oral herpes (2 [6.7%] and 0 [0%], respectively);
- syncope (2 [6.7%] and 0 [0%], respectively);
- constipation (2 [6.7%] and 0 [0%], respectively);
- dental caries (1 [3.3%] and 2 [6.3%], respectively);
- dermatitis atopic (0 [0%] and 2 [6.3%], respectively); and
- arthropod bite (0 [0%] and 2 [6.3%], respectively).

Out of the 62 randomized participants, 1 participant in the placebo group experienced a TEAE related to COVID-19 during the randomized treatment period. This event was mild in intensity but reported as serious due to hospitalization and did not lead to permanent study intervention discontinuation.

## TEAEs during the dupilumab exposure period

The number (%) of participants with TEAEs during the dupilumab exposure period was 58 (93.5%) in the overall population (N=62). During the dupilumab exposure period, the most frequently reported TEAEs by PT (≥5% of participants) in the overall population were:

- nasopharyngitis (31 [50.0%]);

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- COVID-19 (29 [46.8%]);
- pyrexia (18 [29.0%]);
- conjunctivitis allergic (14 [22.6%]);
- dental caries, acne (7 [11.3%] each);
- gastroenteritis (6 [9.7%]);
- influenza, urticaria (5 [8.1%] each); and
- hordeolum, headache, dermatitis contact, foot fracture, hand fracture, and ligament sprain (4 [6.5%] each).

## TEAEs considered related to IMP

In the randomized IMP intervention period, the proportion of participants with TEAEs considered related to IMP (per Investigator) was higher in the dupilumab group compared with the placebo group (5 [16.7%] and 3 [9.4%], respectively). The most frequently reported TEAE considered related to IMP by PT with an incidence of ≥5% in either intervention group was conjunctivitis allergic (2 [6.7%] in the dupilumab group and none in the placebo group). In the dupilumab exposure period (when the IMP was dupilumab), the number (%) of participants with TEAEs considered related to IMP (dupilumab) was 17 (27.4%) participants in the overall population. The most frequently reported TEAE considered related to IMP by PT with an incidence of ≥5% overall was conjunctivitis allergic (7 [11.3%] overall; 4 [13.3%] in the dupilumab/dupilumab group and 3 [9.4%] in the placebo/dupilumab group). The TEAE of neutropenia considered related to IMP was reported in 2 (3.2%) participants during the dupilumab exposure period, both of whom were aged ≥6 years to &lt;12 years old at baseline . These TEAEs were mild in intensity, did not required corrective treatment/therapy and resolved without permanent discontinuation of IMP.

## TEAEs by intensity

During the randomized IMP intervention period, a total of 18 (60.0%) participants in the dupilumab group and 19 (59.4%) participants in the placebo group reported TEAEs of mild intensity. A total of 2 (6.7%) participants in the dupilumab group and 2 (6.3%) participants in the placebo group reported TEAEs of moderate intensity. No participants in either the dupilumab group or the placebo group reported a TEAE of severe intensity.

During the dupilumab exposure period, a total of 55 (88.7%) and 18 (29.0%) participants in the overall population reported TEAEs of mild and moderate intensity, respectively. Two (3.2%) participants reported TEAEs of severe intensity during the dupilumab exposure period. All TEAEs of severe intensity were considered not related to IMP and resolved during the study; the corrective treatment/therapy was required for the events of viral infection, febrile convulsion, and seizure, and not required for 2 episodes of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

## Serious adverse events

During the randomized IMP intervention period, treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 1 (3.3%) participant in the dupilumab group and 1 (3.1%) participant in the placebo group. None of these events were considered related to IMP by the Investigator. During the dupilumab exposure period, overall, 4 (6.5%) participants reported treatment-emergent SAEs. In the dupilumab/dupilumab group, 1 (3.3%) participant reported an event of terminal ileitis (during the IMP intervention period), 1 (3.3%) participant reported 2 events of febrile convulsion and seizure (during the OLE period), and 1 (3.3%) participant reported an event of skin laceration (during the OLE period); in the placebo/dupilumab group, 1 (3.1%) participant reported 2 episodes of attention deficit hyperactivity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

disorder (during the OLE period). None of these events were considered related to IMP by the Investigator. During the randomized IMP intervention period and during the dupilumab exposure period, no participants died during this study.

## Discontinuation and adverse events of special interest

In both the randomized IMP intervention period and the dupilumab exposure period, no participants permanently discontinued the study intervention due to a TEAE. One participant in the dupilumab group permanently discontinued the study intervention due to a pretreatment AE during the randomized IMP intervention period. No participants had any treatment-emergent AESI in the randomized IMP intervention period. The proportion of participants with any treatment-emergent other selected AE grouping event was higher in the dupilumab group compared with the placebo group (26.7% [8/30] and 9.4% [3/32], respectively), and this difference was primarily driven by TEAEs of conjunctivitis. During the dupilumab exposure period, there was 1 participant (1.6%) with at least 1 treatment-emergent AESI in the overall population (1 [3.3%] in the dupilumab/dupilumab group). This AESI was a non-serious event of anaphylactoid reaction.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The MAH submitted the results of the clinical study EFC16823 that was part of the Japan paediatric clinical development programme, however, it was not part of the completed European Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for dupilumab for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. These results are assessed in terms of their possible impact on the benefit-risk balance and the product information, respectively.

Study EFC16823 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study to assess the efficacy, safety, and PK of dupilumab with concomitant TCS use in Japanese participants aged 6 months to &lt;18 years with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease was not adequately controlled with existing therapies. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab administered concomitantly with TCS as measured by the proportion of participants with EASI-75 at Week 16. Key secondary endpoints were the percent change in EASI score from baseline to Week 16, percent change from baseline to Week 16 in weekly average of daily worst itch NRS for participants aged ≥6 years to &lt;12 years old, and the proportion of participants with an IGA score of 0 or 1 at Week 16. All objectives and endpoints are established for clinical studies in AD and with Dupixent. The study intervention period was 16 weeks with a subsequent open-label period with active treatment for all study participants lasting three years or until approval. The dosing regimens were in line with the authorised weight-based dose regimens included in the product information. All patients received topical corticosteroids with an initial standardisation period, and the TCS regimen could be adapted during the study according to the individual needs of the participants. In the OLE period, topical calcineurin inhibitors were allowed in addition to TCS.

The different analysis populations included all enrolled participants. Overall 62 participants with a diagnosis of AD according to the American Academy of Dermatology consensus criteria were enrolled. Most patients were between 6 and 12 years of age with a body weight between 30 and 60 kg, no participants were included in the youngest age group ( ≥6 months -&lt;2 years). Two thirds were male and all were of Japanese origin. The vast majority completed the intervention period as well as the study.

Reasons for early and permanent study intervention discontinuation in the dupilumab group were an adverse event and a withdrawal by subject. No participant in the placebo group withdrew permanently from study intervention. Disease characteristics at baseline indicate that the study population had moderate-to-severe disease activity with a mean time since first diagnosis of AD of 7.4 years. Baseline

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

serum total IgE was significantly increased in all participants suggesting an extrinsic phenotype which is the predominant AD phenotype in all children with AD, especially in male patients.

The clinical pharmacology results (PK, PD, and immunogenicity analyses) are in line with the known PK, PD, and immunogenicity of the dupilumab clinical programme. A significant decrease total IgE and in TARC/CCL17 concentrations as compared with placebo at Week 4 was observed during the 16-week intervention period. Immunogenicity appears to be low, however, overall participant numbers were rather limited for the verification of an ADA response to treatment. As to efficacy results, superiority of dupilumab over placebo was demonstrated for the primary endpoint, and the results were comparable to those observed in studies R668-AD-1526 and R668-AD-1652. Superiority of dupilumab over placebo was also demonstrated for two out of three key secondary endpoints, i.e. percent change in EASI (%EASI) score change from baseline to Week 16 and percent change from baseline to Week 16 in weekly average of daily worst itch NRS for participants aged ≥6 years to &lt;12 years old. No differences between the dupilumab and the placebo group were observed regarding the proportion of participants achieving an IGA score of 0 or 1 at Week 16. This result appears unusual as treatment effects as measured by IGA scale were apparent around week 2 in AD studies with dupilumab, e.g. in study R668-AD-1652. The MAH justifies this result by an insufficient statistical power to demonstrate the difference between groups in this endpoint.

The IMP exposure was balanced between both treatment groups and the majority of participants was exposed for ≥16 weeks of treatment with IMP in both intervention groups. Most participants were exposed for ≥104 weeks of tre atment. Participants with any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) were numerically balanced between both treatment groups. During IMP intervention period most frequently reported TEAEs by preferred term were allergic conjunctivitis, nasopharyngitis, and pyrexia. No severe TEAEs or TEAEs leading to death were observed. One serious adverse events (SAE) occurred in each intervention group that were considered unrelated to study treatment. During the whole dupilumab exposure period including the open-label extension phase, four participants experienced unrelated SAEs, i.e. three in the dupilumab/dupilumab group (terminal ileitis, febrile convulsion and seizure and skin laceration) and one in the placebo group (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder).

Treatment-related TEAEs were rare; most frequently reported in the dupilumab group during the intervention and exposure periods was allergic conjunctivitis, a known adverse drug reaction that occurred predominantly in atopic dermatitis studies.

In conclusion, dupilumab was well tolerated and no safety concerns were identified. The treatment effect as measured by IGA scale was unconvincing, however, the results regarding the primary and other key secondary endpoints were acceptable suggesting a meaningful clinical treatment benefit in the Japanese study participants. It is concurred that the obtained results do not impact the information included in the product information.
