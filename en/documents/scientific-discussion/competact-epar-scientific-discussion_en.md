## 1. Introduction

Type  2  diabetes  mellitus  is  a  heterogeneous  disorder  characterised  by  multiple  defects  in  the pancreatic β -cell,  liver,  and  peripheral  tissues  such  as  skeletal  muscle  and  adipose  tissue.  There  is considerable debate about the primacy of insulin resistance or beta cell failure in the disorder. It is well documented  that  three major  metabolic  abnormalities contribute to  the  development  of hyperglycaemia  in  type  2  diabetes  mellitus,  including  impaired  insulin  secretion  in  response  to glucose, increased hepatic glucose production, and decreased insulin-dependent glucose uptake in the peripheral tissues. The latter two abnormalities are defined as insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is reversed by enhancing the action of insulin, thereby promoting glucose utilisation in peripheral tissues, suppressing  gluconeogenesis  in  the  liver,  and  reducing  lipolysis  at  the  adipocyte.  Insulin  resistance appears in early stages of the disease. It is a major factor in the progression of the disease, contributing to  beta  cell  exhaustion  due  to  demands  on  insulin  secretion.  The  prolonged  hyperglycaemia,  which results from the metabolic defects causes microvascular and macrovascular damage, which is a cause of considerable morbidity and mortality.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Europeans is at least 2-3 % and increases substantially in those older  than  70  years.  Microvascular  (retinopathy,  nephropathy  and  neuropathy)  and  macrovascular complications  (e.g.,  ischemic  heart  disease)  of  diabetes  are  common.  Microvascular  complications appear to be related to hyperglycaemia. Macrovascular complications are more related to dyslipidaemia and blood pressure control. The main goal of treatment for type 2 diabetes is to prevent acute and chronic complications, through better control of blood glucose levels and the management of macrovascular risk factors associated to diabetes (dyslipidaemia, blood pressure control and central obesity). The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS)  demonstrated  that  HbA1c  must  be  reduced  to  &lt;7%  to  minimise  the  development  of microvascular complications. Diet and exercise are the cornerstones of treatment in order to correct obesity and hyperglycaemia. However, 40 to 60 % of newly treated patients do not respond adequately or fail to comply with diet. Available drug treatments are:

- Sulphonylureas  (SU),  which  increase  insulin  secretion.  Their  main  adverse  effects  are hypoglycaemia and weight gain.
- Metformin  (Met),  which  increases  intestinal  glucose  utilisation,  decreases  hepatic  glucose production  and increases  insulin  sensitivity.  Metformin  may  also  improve  dyslipidaemia. Gastrointestinal  undesirable  effects  (e.g.,  diarrhoea  in  about  15%  of  patients)  and  lactic acidosis represent the main adverse effects.
- Thiazolidinediones  (TZDs),  such  as  pioglitazone,  which  increase  insulin  sensitivity  and enhance glucose uptake in skeletal muscle.
- Alpha-glucosidase  inhibitors,  which  have  shown  limited  efficacy  but  with  no  risk  of hypoglycaemia. Gastrointestinal undesirable effects limit compliance.
- Insulin, which is used in type 2 diabetes when oral agents have failed to achieve glycaemic control or in case of complications. Insulin may cause hypoglycaemia and weight gain.

The published UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) compared intensive care therapy to standard care therapy in a population of 4000 adults over a 9-year period (1977-1997). Results showed a 3-5 % rate of all diabetes-related events per year. Intensive therapy for glycaemia and tight blood pressure control  has  the  potential  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  microvascular  complications.  In  addition,  other cardiovascular risk factors including hyperlipidaemia should also be treated. Intensive therapy in the UKPDS produced  a  non-significant  15  %  decrease  in  macrovascular  disease.  Decreasing  glycated haemoglobin  (HbA1C)  by  0.7  %  or  achieving  fasting  plasma  glucose ≤ 6  mmol/l  was  found  to  be crucial and the various agents used had similar efficacy (UKPDS). All treatment groups shared similar outcomes  with  the  exception  of  the  metformin-treated  group:  Mortality  from  all  causes  and  from cardiovascular causes was reduced only in the metformin-treated group with intensive plasma glucose control.

Within 3 years of onset of type 2 diabetes, approximately 50% of patients require multiple therapy, and after nine years this number increases to 75%. Current guidelines recommend the addition of SU

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

as first line combination  with  metformin  but  there is evidence  that clinicians are adopting thiazolidinediones as the second treatment to add to metformin (before SU) in an attempt to preserve pancreatic function.

Compliance with treatment is an important factor in achieving glycaemic control. The combination of two different classes of antihyperglycaemic agents in a single tablet can simplify the treatment and serve to improve compliance.

Currently,  SU-metformin FDC are not available on the European market. In October 2003, a fixed dose combination of rosiglitazone-metformin was approved through the centralised procedure with the indication 'Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, particularly overweight patients, who are unable  to  achieve  sufficient  glycaemic  control  at  their  maximally  tolerated  dose  of  oral  metformin alone'.

This  application  was  for  a  fixed  dose  combination  product,  Competact,  containing  two  authorized ingredients, pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride.

Pioglitazone (as hydrochloride) (Actos; Glustin) was originally authorized in the European Union in October 2000 at doses of 15 or 30 mg once daily for:

'oral  combination  treatment  in  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  patients  with  insufficient  glycaemic  control despite maximal tolerated dose of oral monotherapy with either metformin or sulphonylurea:

- in combination with metformin particularly in overweight patients

-  in  combination  with  a  SU  only  in  patients  who  show  intolerance  to  metformin  or  for  whom metformin is contraindicated.'

In  2002,  new  data  were  submitted  in  a  type  II  variation  and  pioglitazone  was  approved  for  'oral monotherapy  in  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  patients,  particularly  overweight  patients,  inadequately controlled by diet and exercise for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance.'  In a subsequent type II variation, the approved maximum daily dose was increased to 45 mg.  At  this  time,  the  application  for  an  unrestricted  combination  therapy  (i.e.  deleting  current qualifying conditions for its use in combination with metformin or SU) was rejected by the CHMP.

Metformin was originally granted national authorisations in the EU from 1959 to 1997. Following a referral  to  the  CPMP  under  Article  11  of  Council  Directive  75/319,  as  amended,  a  decision  on  a harmonised SPC for metformin was issued in February 2001. The indication proposed for Competact is consistent with that already approved for Actos in combination with metformin.

This  application  was  submitted  under  Part  B  of  the  Annex  to  regulation  2309/93  and  was  a  full 'mixed' application in accordance with Article 8(3) and Annex I Part II.7 of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.

The present application for a fixed-dose combination was based mainly on:

- Three already assessed clinical studies where pioglitazone was added to metformin and that previously supported the approval of the product to be used in combination with metformin .
- New clinical pharmacology studies intended to demonstrate that the FDC tablet is equivalent to both tablets taken separately.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. Quality aspects

## Introduction

The product is a fixed dose combination containing 15 mg of pioglitazone (as hydrochloride) and 850 mg of metformin hydrochloride as active substances. They are presented as film coated tablets.

Other  ingredients  are:  cellulose  microcrystalline,  povidone,  croscarmellose  sodium,  magnesium stearate, hypromellose, macrogol, talc, and titanium dioxide.

Film coated tablets are supplied in aluminium/aluminium blisters.

## Active Substances

Two  active  substances  are  used  in  this  fixed  combination  product,  pioglitazone  hydrochloride  and metformin hydrochloride.

## Pioglitazone (as hydrochloride)

This active substance has been authorised as a result of an earlier centralised procedure for the same applicant under the invented names Actos (EU/1/00/150) and Glustin (EU/1/00/151).

It is a white crystalline solid that is odourless and slightly bitter. The active substance is produced as a racemate  and  it  is  practically  insoluble  in  water;  from  practically  insoluble  to  sparingly  soluble  in aqueous  solutions  at  different  pH  values,  it  is  soluble  in  several  polar  organic  solvents  and  freely soluble in dimethylsulfoxide. Pioglitazone hydrochloride has a specific crystalline form and has not demonstrated polymorphism.

Pioglitazone HCl is manufactured, by chemical synthesis, in five steps. Adequate in-process controls are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control  methods  for  intermediate  products, starting  materials  and  reagents,  have  been  presented.  The  three  batch  synthesis  data  for  each manufacturing  site  presented  show  a  reproducible  manufacturing  process  leading  to  homogeneous batches.

Pioglitazone  hydrochloride  specifications  includes  tests  for  description,  identification  (IR,  UV  and HPLC),  assay  (HPLC,  99.0-101.0%),  related  substances  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  water content, residue on ignition, heavy metals, and particle size.

The tests and limits in the specifications are considered appropriates for controlling the quality of this active substance.

The re-test period proposed is acceptable according to the stability data submitted.

## Metformin hydrochloride

Metformin hydrochloride described in the Ph. Eur. It is a white crystalline powder that is odourless and has a slightly bitter taste. The compound is hygroscopic, freely soluble in water, slightly soluble in alcohol and practically insoluble in acetone, ether and chloroform. It has a specific crystalline form and  has  not  demonstrated  polymorphism.  Particle  size  does  not  influence  dissolution  of  metformin hydrochloride, because it is freely soluble in water.

The  chemistry,  manufacturing  and  control  information  on  metformin  hydrochloride  has  been evaluated by the EDQM and a European Certificate of Suitability of the Monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) has been issued. No additional tests are included in the CEP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Metformin  hydrochloride  specifications  includes  tests  for  description,  identification  (IR,  PhEur), solubility (Ph Eur), melting point (Ph Eur), Loss on drying (Ph Eur), heavy metals (Ph Eur), content (Ph Eur, 98.5-101.0%), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), and particle size.

The tests and limits in the specifications are considered appropriates for controlling the quality of this active substance.

Batch analysis data of the three batches of metformin hydrochloride active substances are provided. The three lots are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

The stability of metformin hydrochloride active substance has been evaluated for 19 batches storaged under 25ºC ± 2ºC / 60% ± 5% up to 60 months and under 40ºC ± 2ºC / 75% ± 5% for 2 batches.

The re-test period proposed was considered acceptable according to the stability data submitted.

## Medicinal Product

-  Pharmaceutical Development

As the product is a combination of two existing oral antidiabetics, the product was developed to be bioequivalent to commercial products containing the individual active substances. It was found that the  two  most  important  properties  to  influence  the  formulation  selection  were  the  dependence  of pioglitazone  hydrochloride  solubility  on  pH  and  the  marked  increase  in  pH  occurring  with  the dissolution  of  metformin  hydrochloride  thereby  affecting  pioglitazone  hydrochloride  solubility. Therefore,  particle  size  of  pioglitazone  hydrochloride  played  an  important  factor  in  the  drug formulation development. The  reduced particle size of pioglitazone hydrochloride allows its dissolution at an acidic pH before the dissolution of metformin hydrochloride changes the pH to an alkaline pH.

To investigate the potential for interactions between the active substances and other ingredients that might  be  used  in  tablet  formulations,  the  binary  compatibility  of  pioglitazone  hydrochloride  and metformin hydrochloride with each other and the excipients used for the medicinal product dosage forms was studied using stress and accelerated conditions. Both active substances and each excipient were mixed physically at an appropriate ratio. Good compatibility was demonstrated between all of them.

In  order  to  avoid  the  metformin  hydrochloride  unpleasant  taste,  the  medicinal  product  has  been developed  as  film-coated  tablets.  The  excipients  are  conventional  and  compatible  with  the  active substances, and meet the requirements in Ph. Eur.

The  excipients  used  are:  cellulose  microcrystalline  (diluent),  povidone  (binder),  croscarmellose sodium (disintegrant),  magnesium  stearate  (lubricant),  hypromellose  (film  coating  agent),  macrogol (plasticizer),  talc  (lubricant),  and  titanium  dioxide  (pigment).  There  are  not  excipients  of  animal  or human origin.

The package selected for tablets is a conventional blister aluminium/aluminium, that is a protective container  against  moisture.  The  choice  of  container  is  influenced  by  the  hygroscopic  properties  of metformin hydrochloride and thus the formulation itself. Stability studies demonstrated the suitability of the chosen package.

##  Manufacture of the Product

Product  manufacture  consists  of  standard  processes  including  mixing/pulverisation,  granulation/ milling, blending, compression, and film coating.

The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies  for  the  major  steps  of  the manufacturing process in three production-scale batches  of each and is satisfactory. The in process controls are adequate for this film coated tablet preparation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  6  commercial  scale  batch  analysis  data  provided  show  that  the  film  coated  tablets  can  be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this oral preparation.

##  Product Specification

The  product  specifications  include  tests  by  validated  methods  for  appearance,  identification  of  the active substances (HPLC, UV), dissolution of the active substances (Ph Eur), uniformity of content of the  active  substances  (HPLC),  assay  of  the  active  substances  (95-105%,  HPLC),  related  substances (HPLC), and microbial limit (Ph Eur).

Degradation products are controlled and their limits are justified by reference to stability studies and toxicology studies.

The tests and limits of the specifications for the finished product are appropriate to control the quality of the finished product for their intended purpose.

Batch  analysis  data  on  three  pilot-scale  batches  confirm  satisfactory  uniformity  of  the  product  at release.

##  Stability of the Product

Stability data of three pilot batches of both strengths stored for 6 months at 40 ˚ C ± 2 ˚ C/75% RH ± 5% RH and for 18 months at 25 ˚ C ± 2 ˚ C/60% RH ± 5% RH were provided. In addition, samples  were  stored  in  stress  conditions  at  50ºC  for  3  months;  60ºC  for  2  months, 25ºC/31%RH and 25 ºC/93 % for 3 months and were also exposed to light

The batches of tablets were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Samples were tested  for  appearance,  dissolution,  assay,  related  substances,  hardness,  loss  on  drying  (LOD), microbial testing and moisture limits.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are acceptable.

## Bioequivalence

Biopharmaceutics studies demonstrated bioequivalence of both doses of the fixed combination product to the individual commercially available pioglitazone and metformin products. Efficacy and safety of the combination product is based on studies of concomitant administration of the two drugs and on postmarketing experience. As bioequivalence has been demonstrated, the product is expected to be as safe and effective as the concomitant use of the individual drugs. See clinical part of the report for details.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

In general, the quality of the product is adequately established, satisfactory chemical and pharmaceutical documentation has been submitted for marketing authorization. Relevant ICH/CPMP guidelines and Pharmacopoeial requirements have been taken into account in the quality documentation and there are no major deviations from EU and ICH requirements.

Two  active substances are presented in this fixed combination: pioglitazone  and  metformin hydrochloride.  Pioglitazone  data  were  originally  presented  in  a  previous  EC  application  dossier relative to pioglitazone tablets, and information on metformin hydrochloride has been supplied in the form of a CEP.

Acceptable specifications have been presented for both active substances. The synthetic pathway, the structure  and  impurity  profile  are  characterized  and  are  in  line  with  current  ICH  guidelines.  The stability data on the active substances supports the proposed re-testing period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The development and the manufacturing process of the finished products are properly described, the results from validation batches show that the manufacturing process is successfully validated, and are suitable to ensure consistent quality of the active substance and the finished product.

Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf  life  stated  in  the  Summary  of  Product Characteristics can be accepted.

## 3. Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

No new non-clinical studies were conducted by the applicant with the FDC (fixed dose combination) compound. The applicant has submitted extensive documentation concerning nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of pioglitazone and metformin.

The nonclinical data relating to pioglitazone is derived from bibliographic references and original data of the previous pioglitazone submission made in 1999.

The applicant has performed an extensive literature review on metformin using the dates 1960 to 2005 to search pubmed and toxnet with applicable search terms. There is a paucity of non-clinical studies on metformin (especially related to pharmacokinetics and toxicology), but this is superseded by long-term clinical experience.

In view  of the length and extent of clinical experience obtained with co-administration of commercially available pioglitazone and metformin, the absence of additional non-clinical studies was considered acceptable.

All pivotal pioglitazone non-clinical studies were conducted according to GLP. Non-clinical studies of metformin were conducted prior to the establishment of GLP criteria.

## Pharmacology

-  Primary pharmacodynamics

In  vitro,  pioglitazone  shows  high  binding  affinity  for  activating  the  human  and  rat  PPAR (EC50 ranging from 420 to 680 nmol/L), but only weak activation of the human PPAR α . Metabolites (M-II, M-III  and  M-IV)  of  pioglitazone  showed  also  activity  on  PPAR γ .  In  vivo,  pioglitazone  reduced tumour necrosis factor α and sphingomyelinase (thought to play a role in the development of insulin resistance) levels in the tissues of insulin resistant rats to values comparable to those found in insulinsensitive  rats.  Increased  insulin-stimulated  glucose  incorporation,  glycogen  synthesis  and  glycolysis were observed in preparations from animals treated with pioglitazone. Pioglitazone had no effect on plasma glucose or insulin in normoglycemic rats, but induced dose- and time-dependent reductions of plasma  glucose,  insulin,  triglycerides,  and  non-esterified  fatty  acids  elevations  in  insulin-resistant, genetically  obese/hyperglycaemic  rodents.  Pioglitazone  improved  fasting  and  postprandial  serum immuno-reactive  insulin and dose-dependently  decreased plasma  glucose and triglycerides in spontaneously obese monkeys, but effects on obese beagle dogs were not consistent. Metabolites M-II, M-III and M-IV showed lower but significant hypoglycaemic and hypotriglyceridemic activities.

γ

The mode of action of metformin is not fully understood, but recent experimental evidence shows that metformin decreases gluconeogenesis. In vitro, metformin increases the functional activity of glucose transporters  (GLUT-1  and  GLUT-4),  stimulates  AMPK  activity,  and  inhibits  glucose-stimulated insulin  secretion  in  both  human  pancreatic  islets  and  a β -cell  line  (MIN6).  In  vivo,  metformin increased glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase in the liver in diabetic mice and controlled glycaemia in naturally acquired diabetic cats for 4 months. However, in conscious normal dogs the primary effect on glucose metabolism was attributable to a decrease in hepatic glycogenolysis and not to an alteration in gluconeogenic flux.

Coadministration of pioglitazone and metformin decreased plasma glucose and insulin levels further than both drugs separately, but did not result in additional decreases of plasma TG levels.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Secondary pharmacodynamics

The distribution of white and brown adipose tissue is modulated by pioglitazone.  Increases in white fat  depots  result  from  increased  caloric  intake  when  the  animals  are  fed ad  libitum but  can  be controlled by restricting food intake. Human adults do not have an equivalent tissue to the brown fat deposits found in rodents thus there can be no clinical impact of the effect of pioglitazone on brown fat.    Since  the  animal  studies  show  that  dietary  restriction  can  prevent  weight  gain  as  a  result  of increased white fat deposition, dietary control should form part of patient treatment.

Studies in models  of  type II diabetes in mice, rats,  and  dogs  showed  that  metformin  has vasculoprotective  effects.  Anti-ischemic  effects  have  been  demonstrated  in  non-diabetic  hamsters, rats,  and  humans.  The  beneficial  effects  in  both  diabetic  and  non-diabetic  subjects  indicate  that  the effect is independent of the antihyperglycaemic activity of metformin. Several mechanisms appear to be involved.

##  Safety pharmacology programme

A series of general pharmacology studies were carried out to test the potential of pioglitazone to alter cardiovascular, respiratory, central nervous and gastrointestinal system function. In mice, pioglitazone decreased spontaneous locomotor activity and showed no effects on skeletal muscle coordination or on pentobarbital-induced sleep time; there were no pioglitazone-related effects on body temperature and spinal reflex in rats or abnormal activity on EEG recorded from cats. Pioglitazone did not affect the blood pressure or heart rate in conscious rats or beagle dogs at a dose of 300 and 30 mg/kg. Recent studies suggest that pioglitazone had no significant effect on ventricular myocyte excitability, action potential configuration, or membrane currents over the concentration range 1 to 10 µ mol/L. At 100 µ mol/L, pioglitazone produced a rightward shift in the concentration-response curve of the contraction of  the  isolated  guinea  pig  ileum  in  response  to  acetylcholine,  histamine,  and  barium  and  slightly inhibited  the  maximum  contraction.  Pioglitazone  had  no  significant  effect  on  gastric  emptying, intestinal transport, and urine volume or urinary excretion of sodium or potassium in rats.

No formal safety pharmacology studies have been performed on metformin that was developed in the 1950s.  No  such  studies  are  considered  necessary  in  view  of  the  extensive  clinical  experience accumulated over several decades of use.

##  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No specific studies of potential drug interactions with pioglitazone were carried out. The weight of evidence suggested that serious adverse drug interactions with insulin, glibenclamide or voglibose, an α -glucosidase inhibitor, were unlikely. No specific studies on the safety pharmacology of metformin were provided, which was acceptable as it is superseded by clinical experience.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pioglitazone is a high permeability and low solubility drug, metformin is a low permeability and high solubility  drug,  good  absorption  was  observed  in  animals  and  in  humans  for  both  drugs  with  no (metformin) or low (pioglitazone) hepatic first-pass effect.

Plasma protein binding of pioglitazone across species was relatively high. Radioactivity was widely distributed  to  tissues  in  rats  after  [ 14 C]pioglitazone  administration,  and  was  excreted  into  milk  of lactating rats. Metformin binds negligibly to plasma proteins.

Pioglitazone  did  not  induce  cytochrome  P450  in  rats.  All  six  human  Phase  I  metabolites  of pioglitazone were identified in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. Pioglitazone is metabolized primarily by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. The contribution of these CYP isoforms to the metabolism of pioglitazone was  comparable  with  the  residual  activity  caused  by  other  isoforms  including  CYP1A1,  CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. Results of extensive in  vitro testing  indicate  little  potential  for pioglitazone to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs via these mechanisms. Since pioglitazone is not exclusively  metabolised  by  any  CYP  isoform,  it  is  unlikely  that  other  drugs  will  interfere  with  its metabolism and vice versa. Metformin is not metabolized in all species.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Radioactivity  was  excreted  rapidly  in  all  species  following  administration  of  [ 14 C]pioglitazone, generally  by  the  faecal  excretion  route  and  by  the  urinary  excretion  route  in  monkeys.  In  rats, pioglitazone-derived  radioactivity  was  re-absorbed  following  excretion  into  bile.  Metformin  is primarily eliminated by renal secretion.

In conclusion, the preclinical pharmacokinetics and metabolism data supports the clinical pharmacokinetic experience with this drug in combination use with metformin.

## Toxicology

##  Single dose toxicity

Pioglitazone was well tolerated in both rats and mice after single oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg. LD50 values  following  intraperitoneal  dosing  were  181 mg/kg  for  mice  of  both  sexes  and  558  and  587 mg/kg  for  male  and  female  rats,  respectively.  Oral  metformin  LD50  values  were  high  enough  in relation to a human dose intended in the clinical practice.

##  Repeat dose toxicity

Repeated  dose  toxicity  of  pioglitazone  after  oral  administration  was  studied  in  mouse  (up  to  13 weeks), rat (up to 13 weeks) dog (up to3 months) and monkey (up to 90 days). The NOAEL, defined as  the  highest  doses  that  did  not  produce  increased  heart  weight,  were  3.2 mg/kg/day  (mice),  1 mg/kg/day (rats), 1.1 and 3.4 mg/kg/day (male and female dogs, respectively), and 35.6 mg/kg/day (monkeys).  Plasma  volume  expansion,  because  of  the  enhancement  of  the  natriuretic  properties  of insulin, produced hemodilution (decreased erythrocyte count, haemoglobin and haematocrit) consistently  observed  through  species  at  high  doses.  Cardiac  hypertrophy  was  observed  in  rats  and dogs,  because  of  plasma  volume  expansion,  were  shown  to  be  adaptive  and  reversible.  There  were also  changes  in  the  size  and  location  of  fat  tissue  in  rodents  at  high  doses,  which  were  considered originated by an exaggeration of this pharmacological activity. Liver issues observed in rodents were not  associated  with  elevation  of  liver  enzymes  or  any  signs  of  pathology,  and  were  considered  an adaptive response. The elevation of ALT values observed in dogs was reversible and not associated with histopathological changes. No evidence of toxicity was reported in chronic toxicity studies by oral and parenteral routes in rats, rabbits, and dogs.

There is a paucity of information on metformin, but information gained from studies in rats and rabbits dosed at greater than 100 mg/kg/day showed no abnormalities in growth, haematology, urea nitrogen or histopathology.

##  Genotoxicity

Pioglitazone, along with several of its metabolites and impurities have been shown to have no genotoxic potential in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies

No evidence of genotoxicity of metformin was found in Ames test (S. typhimurium), mammalian gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes, or in a mouse bone marrow micronucleus test.

##  Carcinogenicity

There is no evidence of direct genotoxicity, mitogenesis or cytotoxicity with pioglitazone. There was no  indication  of  any  carcinogenic  potential  for  pioglitazone  in  mice.  However,  there  was  a  doserelated trend towards increased incidence of urinary bladder tumours in male rats at 4 mg/kg/day and higher,  as  mentioned  in  section  5.3  of  the  SPC.  At  the  time  of  marketing  authorisation  for pioglitazone, the hypothesis presented by the applicant of bladder tumours associated with increased pH levels  and  subsequent  calculi  formation  specific  to  male  rats  was  considered  reasonable.  Since then, more PPAR agonists have come to clinical development and presented with similar hyperplastic and tumour responses. Therefore it may be considered that carcinogenicity and PPAR activation may be a class effect, but its transferability to man is as yet unknown. Following consultation between the CHMP and the applicant, the applicant has initiated a series of studies aimed at further investigating the mechanism by which pioglitazone results in a slight increase in urinary bladder tumours in male rats (see table of the risk management plan).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Long-term carcinogenicity studies with metformin have been performed in rats ( ≤ 900 mg/kg/day for 104 weeks) and in mice ( ≤ 1500 mg/kg/day for 91 weeks). No evidence of carcinogenicity was found in  male  or  female  mice  or  in  male  rats.  In  female  rats,  there  was  an  increased  incidence  of  benign stromal uterine polyps at the highest dose. A literature search was conducted on the terms metformin and cancer to note whether there is any possibility that metformin may promote tumour development in any way. The results suggest that the drug has a beneficial effect in cancer, and therefore it does not appear likely that metformin use in combination with pioglitazone increases any potential cancer risk.

##  Reproduction Toxicity

Adverse  birth  and  developmental  effects  are  reported  in  the  offspring  of  animals  treated  with pioglitazone (as mentioned in the SPC, section 5.3). These are often associated with adverse maternal effects, many of which have been attributed to the pharmacological action of the drug and which occur within the clinical dose/exposure range.  It is suggested that the adverse effects of pioglitazone on the pups result from disturbances in maternal physiology rather than a direct toxic effect.

The fertility of male and female rats was unaffected by metformin administration at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day. Metformin was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at daily doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. In  a  recent  report,  embryotoxicity  was  observed  in  vitro  in  a  mouse  embryo  model  at  the  highest concentration of 100 µ g/mL but not at 25 and 5 µ g/mL, the latter  concentration  being  similar  to  a maximum  clinical  serum  level.  Therefore,  the  FDC  of  pioglitazone/metformin  should  not  be  used during pregnancy; this is reflected in the wording of the SPC in section 4.6.

##  Other toxicity studies

There were no manifestations of toxicity in the pigmented tissues of dogs or monkeys in studies of up to one-year duration.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The  physico-chemical  properties  of  pioglitazone  and  metformin  and  the  predicted  concentrations likely to enter the environment are not considered to represent a risk to the environment

## 4. Clinical aspects

## Introduction

This application was submitted under Part B of the Annex to regulation 2309/93 as a full 'mixed' application. The  application  is  for  a  fixed  dose  combination  product,  Competact,  containing  two authorized ingredients, pioglitazone (as hydrochloride) and metformin hydrochloride. Actos (pioglitazone hydrochloride) was originally authorized in the European Union in October 2000 and is currently  authorised  for  use  as  monotherapy  or  as  combination  therapy  with  either  metformin  or  a sulphonylurea  in  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus.  Metformin  was  originally  granted  national authorisations in the EU from 1959 to 1997. Following a referral to the CPMP under Article 11 of Council Directive 75/319, as amended, a decision on a harmonised SPC for metformin was issued in February 2001.

The  approved  indication  is  for  'the  treatment  of  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  patients,  particularly overweight  patients,  who  are  unable  to  achieve  sufficient  glycaemic  control  at  their  maximally tolerated  dose  of  oral  metformin  alone.'  The  claimed  posology  for  this  fixed  dose  combination product was for two strengths, 15mg/500mg and 15mg/850mg of pioglitazone (as hydrochloride) and metformin  hydrochloride,  respectively.  The  posology  approved  is  for  15mg/850mg  of  pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride.

The  data  relating  to  pioglitazone  was  original  data  that  fulfilled  all  of  the  requirements  for pharmacological tests and clinical trials and covers all of the indents in Part I.5 of Annex I Directive 2001/83/EC  as  amended.  The  clinical  documentation  concerning  metformin  was  derived  from bibliographic references. The applicant had conducted a detailed literature search to source suitable

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

publications for a review of the information. All aspects of metformin pharmacokinetics were assessed in published bibliographic reviews and study reports that together provided an extensive body of data.

The Applicant has performed 4 bioequivalence studies (2 of them relevant for this dossier) and one food- effect study. No clinical efficacy studies were conducted with the pioglitazone/metformin fixeddose combination product. Clinical efficacy of the fixed-dose combination product is based on results of  concomitant  administration  of  the  two  drugs,  clinical  trials  with  the  individual  components  and literature data for metformin. Coadministration studies of pioglitazone with metformin encompassed two  short-term  studies  with  16  to  24  weeks'  duration  and  a  104-week  active-controlled  long-term study.

A  paediatric  development  programme  for  this  medicinal  product  was  not  proposed  and  this  was thought to be acceptable, given the fact that the indication is primarily for a condition of adults. No scientific advice has been given in relation to this application.

## GCP

The  Clinical  trials  involving  pioglitazone  and  the  biopharmaceutic  studies  with  the  fixed  dose combination were conducted in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out under acceptable ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with the relevant GCP standards

## Pharmacokinetics

-  Absorption and Bioequivalence

Pioglitazone is  rapidly  absorbed  reaching  maximum  plasma  concentrations  at  0.5-3hrs  after  drug intake. The absolute bioavailability ranged between 70% and 96% with a mean value of 83%.  Food does not significantly influence the absorption of pioglitazone.

Metformin has  an  absolute  oral  bioavailability  of  40-60%  and  peak  concentrations  are  reached  in approximately  2.5  hours.  Absorption  is  incomplete  with  20-30%  of  an  oral  dose  recovered  in  the faeces. Absorption which is largely from the upper small intestine appears to be saturable resulting in less that dose proportional pharmacokinetics. Steady state plasma concentrations are reached within 24 hours at therapeutic doses and are usually in the range of 1-2 mcg/ml. Food decreases the extent of absorption  by 25-40% and delays tmax by less than an hour.

In  order  to  provide  support  for  marketing  approval  of  the  fixed-dose  combination  product,  the Applicant has performed 4 bioequivalence studies (2 of them relevant for this dossier) and one foodeffect study:

The Applicant performed two bioequivalence studies (OPIMET-004 and OPIMET-005) to evaluate two  new  formulations,  a bilayer  formulation  (Competact  BL)  and  a  micronised  formulation (Competact  MP),  to  demonstrate  that  pioglitazone  15  mg/metformin  500  mg  (Competact  MP  and Competact BL) and pioglitazone 15 mg/metformin 850 mg (Competact MP and Competact BL) were bioequivalent to concomitant use of the separate commercial pioglitazone15 mg and metformin 500 mg or metformin 850 mg tablets, respectively. Upon completion of these studies, the Competact MP formulation was identified as suitable for commercial development. A fifth study (OPIMET-006) was performed to investigate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone, metformin and the fixed-dose  combination.    The  commercial  tablets  used  in  these  studies  were  Pioglitazone  and Metformin. The bioequivalence studies and the food-effect study were designed in accordance with the relevant CHMP Notes for Guidance (EMEA CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98, 2001) and the relevant FDA guidance for industry (FDA, 2002).

Study OPIMET-004 was a single-centre, open-label, randomized, 3-period crossover study. Subjects were  randomized  to  1  of  6  treatment  sequences  in  which  they  received  a  single  oral  dose  of  each

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment: 15/500 mg pioglitazone/metformin fixed-dose combination micronised (MP) tablet, 15/500 mg  pioglitazone/metformin  fixed-dose  combination  bilayer  (BL)  tablet,  and  a  15  mg  pioglitazone commercial  tablet  coadministered  with  a  500  mg  metformin  commercial  tablet.  The  3  treatment periods  were  separated  by  a  washout  period  of  7  days.  During  each  period,  blood  samples  were collected  at  specified  times  up  to  72  hours  post  treatment  for  the  measurement  of  pioglitazone  and metformin concentrations. Adverse  events  (AEs)  and  concomitant  medications  were  monitored  and recorded throughout the study. Other safety evaluations included clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations.

A total of 66 subjects (mean age of 31.3 years), including 29 male subjects and 37 female subjects, were  enrolled  in  the  study;  62  (93.9  %)  subjects,  including  28  males  and  34  female  subjects, completed  the  study.  Four  subjects  discontinued  the  study  early:  1  subject  withdrew  voluntarily;  1 subject withdrew because of an AE (mild allergic reaction); 1 subject withdrew because the subject became pregnant; and 1 subject was withdrawn because of a protocol violation.

Based on the primary analysis of AUC and Cmax, exposure to pioglitazone and metformin following administration  of  the  fixed-dose  combination  MP  tablet  was  similar  to  that  observed  following coadministration of the separate commercial pioglitazone and metformin tablets. For both pioglitazone and  metformin,  the  90%  CIs  of  the  LS  mean  ratios  of  AUC(0-tlqc),  AUC(0-inf),  and  Cmax  were within the 80% to 125% range for bioequivalence (97.7 %, 102.5 %, and 95.0 %, for Pioglitazone, and 102.6 %, 102,8 %, and 99.0 % for Metformin, respectively). In addition, there were no statistically significant  differences  observed  in  treatment  comparisons  of  Tmax  and λ z  for  pioglitazone  or metformin, and there were no notable differences between the treatments with respect to T1/2 or CL/F. The overall results thus demonstrate that the fixed-dose combination tablet (pioglitazone 15mg/metformin 500mg) is bioequivalent with respect to rate and extent of exposure compared to the separate  components  available  commercially.  This  tablet  strength,  however,  had  been  not  pursued further during evaluation of the dossier.

Study OPIMET-005 had the same design as Study OPIMET-004 (see above) except that it compared 15/850  mg  pioglitazone/metformin  fixed-dose  combination  tablets  with  the  15  mg  pioglitazone commercial tablet co-administered together with an 850 mg metformin commercial tablet.

A total of 64 subjects (mean age of 32.0 years), including 35 male subjects and 29 female subjects, were randomly assigned to treatment in the study at 1 study site, and 60 (93.8 %) subjects, including 33 male and 27 female subjects, completed the study. Four subjects discontinued the study early: 2 subjects withdrew voluntarily; 1 subject was withdrawn because the subject became pregnant; and 1 subject was lost to follow-up.

Based on the primary analysis of AUC and Cmax, exposure to pioglitazone and metformin following administration  of  the  fixed-dose  combination  MP  tablet  was  similar  to  that  observed  following coadministration of the separate commercial pioglitazone and metformin tablets. As in Study 01-01TL-OPIMET-005, for both pioglitazone and metformin, the 90% CIs of the LS mean ratios of AUC(0tlqc), AUC(0-inf), and Cmax were all within the 80% to 125% range for bioequivalence. Similar results were obtained even when carryover effects were included in the ANOVA model. With regard to the BL  tablet,  exposure  to  pioglitazone  and  metformin  was  also  similar  to  that  observed  following coadministration  of  the  separate  pioglitazone  and  metformin  commercial  tablets.  As  with  the  MP tablet, the 90% CIs of the LS mean ratios for AUC(0-tlqc), AUC(0-inf), and Cmax for both pioglitazone and metformin were within the 80% to 125% bioequivalence range, even when carryover effect was included in the ANOVA model. In addition, there were no statistically significant differences observed in treatment comparisons of Tmax and λ z for pioglitazone or metformin, and there were no significant differences between the treatments with respect to T1/2 or CL/F.

The  overall  results  of  the  2  studies  OPIMET-004  and  -005  demonstrate  that  the  fixed-dose combination tablets (pioglitazone 15mg/metformin 500mg and pioglitazone 15mg/metformin 850mg) were bioequivalent with respect to rate and extent of exposure compared to the separate components available commercially.

Study OPIMET-006 was conducted to determine the effect of food on the exposure to pioglitazone and metformin after administration of the pioglitazone/metformin fixed-dose combination tablet. Both the  Competact  BL  and  MP  formulations  were  investigated  during  this  study,  and  the  higher  dose (pioglitazone 15 mg/metformin 850 mg) of each formulation was evaluated. The study was designed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

so  that  all  28  subjects  would  receive  both  formulations  with  and  without  food,  according  to  a randomly assigned sequence. After each dose, blood samples were collected at specified time points up  to  72  hours  post  treatment  for  the  measurement  of  pioglitazone  and  metformin  concentrations. Administration of the 4 treatments was separated by a 7-day washout period.

An analysis of variance (ANOVA) with fixed effects for sequence, period, and treatment and random effect for subject nested within sequence was performed on time to maximum concentration (Tmax), terminal  rate  constant  ( λ z),  and  the  natural  logarithms  of  AUC(0-tlqc),  AUC(0-inf),  and  Cmax  for pioglitazone  and  metformin.  All  28 subjects  were  included  in  the  pharmacokinetic  and  statistical analyses of the MP formulation. Based on AUC and Cmax values, there was an absence of food-effect response  on  total  and  peak  exposure  of  pioglitazone  and  on  the  total  exposure  of  metformin.  For pioglitazone, the 90% CIs of the LS mean ratios of AUC(0-tlqc), AUC(0-inf), and Cmax were within the  80%,  125%  range.  For  metformin,  the  90%  CIs  of  the  LS  mean  ratios  for  AUC(0-tlqc)  and AUC(0-inf) were within the 80%, 125% range, although there was a 13% decrease in total exposure to metformin based on the point estimate value. There was a food-effect response on the peak exposure of metformin. The 90% CI of the LS mean ratio for Cmax was (65.4%, 79.1%), and the decrease in peak exposure to metformin was 28%. Drug dosing with food resulted in prolongation of Tmax from approximately  1.6  to  3.5  hours  for  pioglitazone  and  from  approximately  2.4  to  3.2  hours  for metformin; both findings are consistent with what is known to occur for Pioglitazone and Metformin. With  respect  to  study  OPIMET-006,  a  food-  effect  for  metformin  was  shown  (decreased  Cmax  and AUC and delayed Tmax). This influence of food on the pharmacokinetics of metformin was expected and  it  is  also  described  when  it  is  administered  alone.  The  magnitude  of  this  food-effect  in  the Competact tablet was lower than that described in the harmonised SPC for metformin. Overall, results from Study OPIMET-006 indicated that the food-effect responses for Competact MP were generally consistent with those previously reported for marketed Pioglitazone and Metformin.

##  Distribution, Elimination, and Dose proportionality

Single and multiple dose studies with Pioglitazone demonstrate linearity of pharmacokinetics in the therapeutic dose range. The volume of distribution is small with a mean of 0.253L/kg.  Pioglitazone is extensively  bound  to  plasma  proteins.  Pioglitazone  undergoes  extensive  hepatic  metabolism  by hydroxylation  of  aliphatic  methylene  groups.    The  clearance  is  sensitive  to  changes  in  both  the intrinsic  capacity  of  the  liver  to  oxidise  drugs  and  the  free  fraction  in  plasma  and  was  found  to  be independent  of  dose  in  the  range  of  2-60mg.  Regular  monitoring  of  liver  function  is  therefore recommended in the SPC (section 4.4), and liver impairment constitutes a contraindication (section 4.3 of the SPC). The terminal elimination half-life following intravenous administration was found to vary between 3.5-9.0 hrs with a mean value of 5.8 hrs.  Following oral administration, the terminal half-life observed in most studies is in the same range. Renal elimination of unchanged pioglitazone is negligible.

Metformin reached  steady  state  plasma  concentrations  within  24  hours  at  therapeutic  doses  and  are usually in the range of 1-2 mcg/ml. It is rapidly distributed and does not bind to plasma proteins. No metabolites or conjugates have been identified. As metformin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine,  significant  accumulation  may  occur  in  renal  impairment,  resulting  in  increased  risk  of  lactic acidosis. Therefore, Competact is contraindicated in patients with moderate renal impairment, with a creatinine clearance&lt; 60ml/min, as indicated in the SPC, section 4.3. In addition, it is recommended in the SPC's section 4.4 to measure renal function regularly.

##  Special populations and Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

Pioglitazone: The  profile  of  metabolites  in  diabetic  patients  is  similar  to  that  seen  in  healthy volunteers.  Kinetics is not appreciably different in the elderly. Drug interaction studies indicate that pioglitazone does not inhibit the metabolism of drugs cleared by the P450 system. Pioglitazone did not affect the steady state pharmacokinetics of sulphonylureas.  Metformin has no major effect on serum pioglitazone concentrations.

Metformin doses of 0.5 to 1.5g have an absolute oral bioavailability of 40 to 60%. The discrepancy between the amount of drug absorbed and the amount available may result from presystemic clearance or binding to the intestinal wall. There was no statistically significant difference in pharmacokinetics of metformin between healthy subjects and patients with T2DM shown in clinical studies. Potential interactions between metformin and acarbose, guar gum and cimetidine exist

## Pharmacodynamics

No new pharmacodynamic studies were submitted for this FDC application.

-  Mechanism of action and Primary and Secondary pharmacology

Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione and a potent and highly selective agonist for the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated  receptor  (PPAR) γ .  PPAR receptors  are  found  in  tissues  important for  insulin  action  such  as  adipose  tissue,  skeletal  muscle,  and  liver.  Activation  of  PPAR γ receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin-responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and  lipid  metabolism.  This  results  in  an  enhancement  of  insulin  sensitivity,  which  manifests  in reduced  hepatic  glucose  production,  increased  glucose  uptake  in  muscle,  and  reduced  lipolysis  in adipocytes. Data in humans to support this mechanism have been done using the euglycaemic clamp technique  and  intravenous  glucose  tolerance  tests  with  application  of  a  minimal  model.  Studies investigating the pharmacodynamics of pioglitazone in diabetic subjects have shown that once-daily administration of pioglitazone at doses of 15, 30 or 60mg improved both FBG and postprandial blood glucose levels, the hypoglycaemic effect being maintained throughout the day. This effect appeared within  2  weeks  of  treatment.  The  fact  that  both  fasting  and  postprandial  blood  glucose  profiles  are improved  by  pioglitazone  suggests  that  pioglitazone  may  improve  glucose  metabolism  in  diabetic patients.  Significant  reductions  in  postprandial  insulin  were  seen  in  these  studies  but  almost  no reductions in fasting insulin were seen. This suggests that pioglitazone has no direct stimulatory effect on the beta cells of the pancreas.

The glucose lowering effect of metformin results from a 25-30% decrease in the rate of endogenous glucose production. This results in a similar relative reduction in fasting plasma glucose levels. It was also  shown  that  metformin  reduces  glucose  production  either  by  decreasing  gluconeogenesis  or  by decreasing glycogenolysis. To a lesser extent, plasma glucose levels are decreased by the stimulation of peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, which is more likely secondary to the reversal of glucotoxicity and not a direct pharmacological effect. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not stimulate insulin secretion.

In addition metformin decreases plasma free fatty acid concentration by 10-30% in individuals with diabetes. Elevated levels of free fatty acid may contribute to increased hepatic glucose production and peripheral  insulin  resistance.  By  ameliorating  the  effects  of  high  free  fatty  acid  (lipotoxicity)  on pancreatic β cells, metformin  may  also partially correct the impaired insulin secretion that characterizes  the  type  2  diabetic  state.  Metformin  was  found  in  high  concentrations  in  the  small intestine  and  may  also  decrease  intestinal  glucose  absorption.  Metformin  decreases  fasting  plasma glucose by 2.5-3.5 mmol/L with a 1-2 % decline in haemoglobin Alc (HbAlc).

When  used  together,  pioglitazone  and  metformin  provide  additive  benefits  and  lead  to  improved control of blood glucose levels. Since neither pioglitazone nor metformin stimulate insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta-cells, the benefits are realised without commensurate increases in circulating insulin levels.

## Clinical efficacy

No clinical studies have been conducted with Competact. Demonstration of efficacy of this FDC relies on the clinical studies for Actos as monotherapy and in combination therapy with metformin (which have been previously submitted and evaluated as part of the Actos application) and on bibliographic data for the metformin component. The support for the fixed-dose combination pioglitazone/metformin product relies largely on 1 pioglitazone plus metformin combination therapy study submitted in 1999 (PNFP-027), and 2 pioglitazone plus metformin combination therapy studies submitted between 2002 and 2004 (EC410 and PNFP-342).

-  Dose response studies

A number of placebo-controlled studies with pioglitazone as monotherapy have been performed and submitted as part of the 1999 MAA. From these data, a dose-response relationship was found from 15

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to 45 mg, the magnitude of the glycaemic response in the range of 0.5% to 2.0% for HbA1c and 1 to 4 mmol/L (20-70 mg/dL) for blood glucose.

Metformin  immediate-release  tablets  can  be  administered  twice  daily  with  meals  if  &lt;2000  mg  is needed for blood glucose control or three times daily in divided doses with meals for daily dosages &gt;2000 mg. In clinical trials, metformin monotherapy reduced FPG by 52-92 mg/dl and HbA1c by 1.42.0% versus placebo over the dose range of 1700 mg-3000 mg daily (Garber, 1997; Stratton, 2000; De Fronzo, 1995). The majority of these trials enrolled overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes in  whom  glycaemic  control  was  inadequate  with  diet  and  exercise  alone.  Reductions  in  these glycaemic parameters are log-linear and dose-dependent over the dose range of 500-2000 mg daily (Garber, 1997).

Dose-response effects thus have been demonstrated for both actives.

##  Main studies

The  studies  which  are  considered  pivotal  to  support  the  combination  use  of  pioglitazone  and metformin are studies EC410, PNFP-342 and PNFP-027. The design of these studies is summarised in Table 1

These studies differed in duration of treatment, use of control, and inclusion of a dose-titration period. They were similar  in  that  pioglitazone  treatment  was  added  to  an  existing  metformin  regimen  that provided insufficient glycaemic control. Also, the dosage of metformin could not be changed once the double-blind treatment period had started, so that all patients were maintained on a stable, maximal tolerated dose of metformin throughout the treatment period. The combination therapy studies shown in  table  1  included  1305  pioglitazone-treated  patients.  The  subsequent  sections  summarize  the  3 studies, with an emphasis on study EC 410.

## METHODS

## Study Participants

In Study EC410, Pioglitazone vs. Gliclazide as Add-on to Metformin was tested in patients with type 2 diabetes, 35 to 75 years of age, with HbA1c 7.5% to 11.0% and fasting C-peptide greater than or equal  to  1.5ng/mL  who  were  currently  being  treated  with  metformin  at  50%  or  greater  maximum recommended dose or at the maximum tolerated the dose for at least 3 months were included into this double-blind, randomised, active-comparator study.

In study PNFP-342, 30 mg Pioglitazone vs. 45 mg Pioglitazone as Add-on to Metformin was tested in patients whose type 2 diabetes was poorly controlled by their current metformin therapy (HbA1c ≥ 8% at screening) and who had a BMI 25 to 45 kg/m2. After a 1-week single-blind placebo lead-in period, subjects received 24 weeks of double-blind treatment during which their dosage of metformin could not  be  adjusted.  In  study  PNFP-027,  30 mg  Pioglitazone  was  compared  vs.  Placebo  as  Add-on  to Metformin in male and female patients 30 to 75 years of age with BMI between 25 and 45, HbA1c greater  than  or  equal  to  8.0%,  and  C-peptide  greater  than  1  ng/mL  who  had  received  constant treatment with metformin for at least 30 days prior to participation in the study for treatment of type 2 diabetes.

In Study EC410, eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive pioglitazone or gliclazide for 104 weeks  in  addition  to  their  existing  metformin  therapy.  Patients  were  initially  seen  every  4  weeks during a forced titration period of 16 weeks where the dose of study drug was increased at each visit from 15 mg od to 45 mg od pioglitazone or 80 mg od through 4 steps to 160 mg bid gliclazide. The dose of study drug was increased at each time point during titration unless the patient had not tolerated the  previous  dose  or  the  investigator  considered  that  the  patient  was  at  risk  of  experiencing hypoglycaemia, or other tolerability issues, should the dose of study drug be further increased. In such circumstances, a reduction in dose by one titration step was permitted. Thereafter, dose of study drug was maintained throughout the remaining 88 weeks of the study.

In study PNFP-342, after a 1-week single-blind placebo lead-in period, subjects received 24 weeks of double-blind treatment during which their dosage of metformin could not be adjusted. In study PNFP027,  each  individual  patient's  dose  of  metformin  remained  constant  throughout  the  duration  of  the study,  and  any  other  antidiabetic  medications  were  discontinued  at  study  entry.  Patients  were randomly assigned to treatment with either 30 mg pioglitazone or placebo in addition to metformin for a period of 16 weeks.

## Outcomes, Endpoints

For all 3 studies the primary efficacy measure was the change in HbA1c from baseline to last value, with a number of secondary endpoints in each study.

## Statistical methods

In  Study  EC410,  the  data  presented  for  all  efficacy  variables  analyses  the  change  from  baseline  to Week 104  (LOCF)  using  an  ANCOVA  model  with  the  factor  treatment  and  the  baseline  value  as covariate  testing  the  null  hypothesis  that  there  is  no  treatment  difference  (2-sided  test, α =0.05).  In addition, 95% confidence intervals were calculated.

## RESULTS

## Participant flow

Withdrawal rates with pioglitazone after 2 years were not higher than those in shorter-term studies. Although the studies were performed in different geographical locations, this suggests that pioglitazone and metformin combinations were generally effective and well tolerated over the longer term. The most common reasons for withdrawal were adverse event or lack of clinical efficacy but these were not more common than with gliclazide in study EC410.

In Study EC410, 74% of patients in the pioglitazone group completed 2 years of treatment compared with 76% in the gliclazide group. Adverse events and lack of efficacy accounted for approximately half of the withdrawals with no major difference between the groups.

## Baseline data

In Study EC410, 630 patients who were randomly assigned to treatment (317 patients to pioglitazone and 313 patients to metformin) were included. The mean age of the patients was approximately 56 years. Approximately 50% of the population was male and more than 99% was Caucasian. Mean BMI was 32.6. Mean HbA1c at baseline was slightly higher in the pioglitazone plus metformin group (8.7%) than in the gliclazide plus metformin group (8.5%). There were no other significant differences among the treatment groups for any of the baseline variables. The mean dose of study drug at the end of dose titration was 38.9 mg pioglitazone and 211.7 mg gliclazide.

Table 3 gives an overview of the baseline characteristics of all 3 studies.

(a) HbA1c and FPG are displayed for individual treatment groups: pioglitazone/gliclazide (EC410); 30 mg/45 mg (PNFP-

342); pioglitazone/placebo (PNFP-027).

In  general,  demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  were  well  matched  across  the  studies.  Whilst most patients in study EC410 were Caucasian, more non-Caucasian patients whereas in studies PNFP342/PNFP-027  (35%  and  16%,  respectively).  Patients  in  the  US  studies  PNFP-342/PNFP-027  had higher HbA1c and FPG compared to EC410. Within study EC410, baseline glycaemic variables were slightly higher in the pioglitazone group than the gliclazide group (Table3).

In EC410, patients received the maximally tolerated dose of study drug. The mean doses at the end of dose titration were 38.9 mg pioglitazone and 211.7 mg gliclazide.

In  study  EC410,  eligible  patients  had  to  be  receiving  companion  medication  (SU  or  metformin)  at greater than equal to 50% of the maximum recommended dose or at their maximum tolerated dose. Only  4%  of  patients  were  on  less  than  50%  the  maximum  recommended  dose  of  concomitant metformin. No such criteria were set in PNFP-342 and PNFP-027; however, the mean percentage of maximum recommended daily dosage of metformin was 61% in both PNFP-342 and PNFP-027, with similar percentages in the individual treatment groups within each study.

## Outcomes and estimation

For all 3 studies the primary efficacy measure was the change in HbA1c from baseline to last value. These  data  are  presented  in  Figure  7  and  show  that  doses  of  30  mg  and  45 mg  pioglitazone  are effective  in  improving  glycaemia  when  concomitantly  administered  with  metformin.  The  data  also suggest  that  peak  effect  may  not  be  seen  until  6  months  treatment  as  in  PNFP-342  and  that  these effects are maintained to 2 years as observed in EC410.

<!-- image -->

In all studies, glycaemic control was further improved following addition of pioglitazone to metformin therapy, at doses up to 45 mg daily. PNFP-027 was a short placebo-controlled study, which showed the benefit of adding 30 mg pioglitazone with a decrease from baseline in HbA1c at 16 weeks of 0.64% compared with an increase in placebo of 0.19%. In study PNFP-342, both 30 mg and 45 mg showed significant  decreases  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  of  0.80%  and  1.01%,  respectively,  after  24  weeks treatment.  This  level  of  improvement  was  similarly  found  in  study  EC410,  which  compared  the addition of pioglitazone with that of gliclazide and continued treatment for 2 years, at which time the decrease  from  baseline  was  maintained  with  pioglitazone  at  0.89%  but  had  showed  signs  of deterioration from maximal effect under gliclazide with a change from baseline at 2 years of 0.77%. Decreases in fasting plasma glucose ranged from 1.8 to 2.8 mmol/L in pioglitazone groups and were found to be statistically significantly greater than those observed with placebo after 16 weeks (2.12 mmol/L) and gliclazide after 2 years (1.1 mmol/L).

Glycaemic  responder  rates  are  summarised  in  Table  4  below  and  responders  were  defined  as  the following:

EC410:

Reduction in HbA1c of greater than 0.6%.

PNFP-342 &amp; PNFP-027:

A HbA1c responder was any patient whose HbA1c reduced to less than or equal to 6.1% or decreased from baseline by greater than or equal to 0.6%.

Pio=pioglitazone, Met=metformin, Glic=gliclazide, 30 mg=30 mg pioglitazone, 45 mg=45 mg pioglitazone, Pbo=placebo.

Responder  rates  demonstrate  that  pioglitazone,  as  combination  therapy  with  metformin,  effectively improved glycaemic control in approximately 60% of patients and that the proportion of patients that respond to therapy is comparable to that seen with the commonly used combination of metformin and sulphonylurea.

In  Study  EC410,  the  time  courses  of  HbA1c  and  FPG  in  Figure  1  demonstrate  that  after  the  initial improvements, glycaemic control was better sustained with pioglitazone as add-on to metformin than by gliclazide, where despite the rapid initial effect, deterioration in control was apparent from Week 16 onwards. In the gliclazide group, there was an increase in mean HbA1c of 0.70% from the nadir at Week 16 to Week 104. In contrast, the onset of effect was slower with pioglitazone with the nadir at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Week 24, but improvements were much better maintained thereafter with an increase in HbA1c of only 0.22% from this point until Week 104.

Figure 2 Study EC410: Pioglitazone and Gliclazide as Add-On to Metformin: Change from Baseline ± SEM in HbA1c [%] and FPG (mmol/L) - LOCF - ITT Population

<!-- image -->

After  2  years  treatment  on  top  of  metformin,  decreases  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  were  0.89%  with pioglitazone and 0.77% with gliclazide. This represents a difference of 0.12% (-0.31, 0.07) between the groups. The reduction in HbA1c was reflected in the number of responders, with almost one third of patients in each treatment group achieving final HbA1c less than 7.0%.

Analysis  of  changes  in  FPG  revealed  a  greater  decrease  from  baseline  with  pioglitazone  than  with gliclazide  (P&lt;0.001  between  groups).  Furthermore,  analysis  of  the  per-protocol  (PP)  population included only those patients who received at least 72 weeks treatment with study drug, and in these patients, the difference between groups in HbA1c change from baseline at Week 104 was statistically significant  (-1.07%  and  -0.76%  for  pioglitazone  and  gliclazide  respectively;  P=0.003).  Taken  as  a whole, these  data  strongly  suggest  that  in  the  long  term,  pioglitazone  offers  better  sustainability  of glycaemic control then gliclazide as an adjunct to metformin. This was further supported in the current study by the coefficient of failure, which was lower with pioglitazone than with gliclazide (0.20%/yr and 0.44%/yr respectively; P&lt;0.001).

##  Discussion on clinical efficacy

No clinical efficacy studies were conducted with the pioglitazone/metformin fixed-dose combination product. Clinical efficacy of the fixed-dose combination product is based on results of concomitant administration of the two drugs, clinical trials with the individual components and literature data for metformin.  Coadministration  studies  of  pioglitazone  with  metformin  encompassed  two  short-term studies with 16 to 24 weeks' duration and a 104-week active-controlled long-term study. In all three studies,  glycaemic  control  was  improved  following  addition  of  pioglitazone  to  existing  metformin therapy.

Pioglitazone  at  doses  of  30mg  (PNFP-027  and  PNFP-342)  and  45mg  (PNFP-342)  and  up  to  45mg (EC410) in combination with metformin also improved insulinaemia, insulin processing, as well as the abnormalities  associated  with  diabetic  dyslipidaemia,  namely  elevated  triglycerides,  low  HDLcholesterol, and a preponderance of small dense LDL particles.

There  are  no  specific  dose  titration  studies  to  determine  the  optimum  pioglitazone  dose  to  be combined with metformin. Doses lower than 30 mg, of pioglitazone (e g 15 mg), as approved in the pioglitazone SPC, have not been studied in combination with metformin, they have only been tested in combination with SU. This is taken into consideration in the posology section of the SPC, where a dose  of  30  mg  pioglitazone  (together  with  1700  mg  metformin)  per  day,  taken  as  two  tablets,  is recommended.

Pioglitazone  has  been  dosed  in  all  these  studies  once  a  day  in  accordance  with  the  currently recommended posology section of the pioglitazone SPC. However, the FDC tablet is to be taken in two divided doses due to the need to divide the metformin dose. To address this concern, the applicant provided during the evaluation evidence that pioglitazone 30 mg bid and 60 mg od results in a similar

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

overall exposure, and supplementary data from small studies with pioglitazone given in divided doses. Thus, the CHMP accepted the interchangeable efficacy of a pioglitazone dose when given divided in two doses instead of the same dose once a day, for this application.

## Clinical safety

Safety information on pioglitazone and metformin fixed dose combination therapy is derived from 3 studies in which pioglitazone and metformin were co-administered (EC410, PNFP-0342, and PNFP027). These studies have been previously submitted and assessed by the CHMP.

##  Patient exposure

The  clinical  programme  for  this  pioglitazone  variation  comprises  3  completed  controlled  clinical studies.  A  total  of  1,785  patients  were  enrolled  in  these  studies.  Of  this  total,  1,312  received pioglitazone as combination therapy with metformin. The remaining patients received metformin plus a comparator agent (either gliclazide or placebo). More than 70% of pioglitazone patients included in EC410 completed 2 years of treatment. The characteristics are shown in Table 1 (section efficacy).

The duration of treatment ranged from 16 to 104 weeks in the combination therapy studies. Dosing regimen for pioglitazone was 30 or 45 mg once daily (od), with the exception of the first portion of EC410, which had a forced dose-titration period during which subjects could initiate treatment at 15 mg od.

As would be expected in a type 2 diabetic population, there were high incidences of vascular disorders (mainly hypertension), other metabolic and nutritional disorders, cardiac disorders, and eye disorders. As is usual in a relatively elderly population, musculoskeletal disorders (mainly arthritis) were also commonly noted as concomitant diseases.

There was a slight imbalance between pioglitazone and gliclazide patients in the incidence of cardiac disorders (mainly angina) in EC410 (pioglitazone 19.2%, gliclazide 13.4%) and vascular disorders (pioglitazone  68.1%,  gliclazide  62.6%).  The  use  of  concomitant  medication  reflected  the  reported concomitant diseases.

##  Adverse events

The data show that the number of patients with at least 1 AE, withdrawing because of AEs, with an SAE, or dying in the course of the studies were similar in pioglitazone-treated groups and comparator groups.

Consistent  across  the  3  studies,  pioglitazone  was  associated  with  higher  reporting  of  oedema.  The terms oedema not otherwise specified, aggravated oedema, and oedema peripheral were grouped in EC410, and the incidence of the grouped term was 6.3% and 2.2% for pioglitazone and gliclazide, respectively.

Weight increase was reported as an AE for pioglitazone when added to metformin in 3.5% of patients compared  to  2.2%  with  gliclazide  in  EC410.  No  other  AEs  for  pioglitazone  and  metformin combination showed any consistent excess over gliclazide and metformin combination. The incidence of weight gain was slightly lowered when pioglitazone 30 mg was added to metformin in study PNFP027 compared to EC410 1.8% vs. 2.2% respectively); this may be a result of the shorter treatment duration  in  study  PNFP-027.  A  slightly  higher  incidence  rate  for  weight  gain  was  noted  in  the pioglitazone  plus  metformin  group  in  PNFP-342  compared  to  either  pioglitazone  30  mg  plus metformin groups in studies EC410 and PNFP-027. The highest rates were noted for the pioglitazone 45 mg plus metformin group in PNFP-342 (6.7%). However, no subject in the pioglitazone 45 mg plus metformin group discontinued study drug dosing because of weight gain.

When  pioglitazone  was  added  to  a  standard  treatment  with  metformin,  there  was  an  increased incidence  of  peripheral  oedema,  weight  gain,  arthralgia  and  headache  as  compared  to  placebo  plus metformin.

##  Serious adverse events and deaths

No deaths were reported in the PNFP-342 or PNFP-027 combination therapy studies. In the 2-year study EC410, 2 patients (0.6%) in each treatment group died during the study. The causes of deaths were in the main cardiovascular or cerebrovascular in aetiology, as might be expected in a diabetic population. There was no death of unusual or unexpected aetiology suggestive of any toxic effects of pioglitazone.

In PNFP-027, when pioglitazone was added to metformin, there were higher rate of SAEs (4.2%) than when placebo was added to metformin (1.3%). However, it should be noted that patient numbers for these latter 2 groups were rather low at about 160 patients per group, and therefore point estimates of rates were liable to large variation. Similar reporting rates of SAEs were observed with the addition of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

both 30 mg pioglitazone (4.4%) and 45 mg pioglitazone (3.8%) to metformin in the 24-week study, PNFP-342.

In the 2-year EC410 study, overall SAE reporting rates for pioglitazone and gliclazide when added to metformin were similar (11.4% with pioglitazone vs. 11.2% with gliclazide). The incidence of cardiac events  was  higher  for  pioglitazone  in  EC410  than  for  gliclazide  when  either  drug  was  added  to metformin.

##  Laboratory findings

Placebo-controlled studies showed that during treatment with pioglitazone there were small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit compared to placebo. The decreases were in the order of about 4% relative to baseline values. This is mentioned in the SPC section 4.4. Whilst similar changes were seen with pioglitazone in EC410, gliclazide also showed decreases in haemoglobin, haematocrit, and red blood cells albeit slightly less than those observed with pioglitazone.

Similarly to that seen during the MAA, study results submitted in the 2002 and 2004 safety summaries showed no evidence of an increased risk of hepatotoxicity with pioglitazone relative to comparator agents.  These  data  show  that  effects  observed  at  1  year  are  sustained  to  2  years  and  still  evident. Analyses of changes in individual patients showed no excess in changes of liver enzymes to &gt;3 ULN with pioglitazone compared with comparator treatments.

##  Physical findings related to safety

Controlled trials  have  shown  weight  increases  with  pioglitazone  treatment.  The  greatest  increase  in weight was seen in insulin combination trials and the least with metformin combination therapy. A study  investigating  effects  of  pioglitazone  on  body  composition  had  demonstrated  that  weight  gain mainly  could  be  explained  by  increases  in  subcutaneous  fat.  Pioglitazone  also  seemed  to  induce  a redistribution of intra-abdominal fat to the subcutaneous fat compartment.

After 2 years, in EC410, weight had further increased in pioglitazone groups, but the rate of weight gain was slower during a second year of treatment. At the end of 2 years, pioglitazone-treated patients had mean gained 2.3 kg in comparison to 1.1 kg with gliclazide. This represents a mean weight gain over  2  years  of  less  than  5%  with  pioglitazone  treatment.  Some  patients  had  still  lost  weight  with pioglitazone as shown by the range of weight changes and the median values.

##  Adverse events by organ system or syndrome

## Cardiovascular

In  the  2-year  study,  which  used  gliclazide  as  a  comparator,  the  incidence  of  cardiac  events  was generally lower when gliclazide was added to metformin than with pioglitazone (1.8% vs. 3.8% for SAEs, respectively, and 3.8% vs. 7.9% for AEs, respectively. Upon inspection of individual events, the main difference appeared to be a lower incidence of angina with gliclazide. In this study, there was a  higher  proportion  of  patients  with  cardiac  and  vascular  conditions  at  baseline  in  the  pioglitazone group. Reporting rates for episodes of heart failure in the placebo and active comparator controlled trials showed no excess in pioglitazone groups compared to non-pioglitazone groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Oedema

Oedema occurs with pioglitazone treatment in 6% to 8% of patients treated over a 1-year period. In by far the majority of AE reports, such oedema was reported as mild or moderate and only very rarely caused withdrawal of treatment with pioglitazone. Only one patient withdrew for oedema in EC410. Although reporting of oedema occurred more frequently during the first few months of treatment, it was also reported later during treatment. With continued treatment, in some cases oedema resolved. Oedema was not associated with development of heart failure.

## Anaemia

Although pioglitazone treatment is known to be associated with small decreases in mean haemoglobin and haemotocrit, the reporting rates of anaemia as an AE were similar with pioglitazone and active comparator treatments. In the course of long-term (2 years) treatment with pioglitazone, anaemia in as an AE was reported for 1.6% of patients treated with pioglitazone and 0.6% of patients treated with gliclazide;  1  pioglitazone  treated  patient  discontinued  study  drug  dosing  because  of  anaemia.  The clinical trial results do not suggest that pioglitazone is associated with large decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit. Furthermore, there is no evidence from AE data from the trials of any toxic effect of pioglitazone on bone marrow.

##  Discontinuation due to adverse events

The  rate  of  AEs  causing  discontinuation  from  the  study  are  shown  in  the  table  below  for  those preferred terms that occurred in at least 3% of patients in any treatment group.

The  proportion of patients discontinuing for any individual AEs  was  low  and  the rate of discontinuations  did  not  increase  over  time  in  the  2-year  study.  Hyperglycaemia  was  the  most common AE leading to discontinuation among pioglitazone-treated patients across these studies, with oedema peripheral  occurring  at  the  same  rate  as  hyperglycaemia  in  studies  EC410  and  PNFP-027. Hypoglycaemia  was  most  common  amongst  gliclazide  patients.  Weight  gain  and  oedema  rarely caused  discontinuation  with  pioglitazone  in  the  short-term  combination  therapy  studies,  and  only  1 patient in the long-term EC410 study discontinued because of oedema (oedema peripheral).

## Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety

For all studies, administration of the pioglitazone/metformin fixed-dose combination tablets resulted in very minor changes in vital sign parameters, and these minor changes were similar to those noted following the coadministration of the individual commercial tablets.

Three subjects (OPIMET-004) had physical examination findings at Post treatment/Early Termination that  were  not  present  at  Baseline  or  Screening.  These  findings  were  reported  as  adverse  events  of pharyngolaryngeal pain, oropharyngeal swelling, hypersensitivity, face oedema, and pruritus.

For  all  studies,  a  standard  12-lead  ECG  was  recorded  for  each  subject  at  the  Screening  and  Post treatment/Early  Termination  Visits.  All  12-lead  ECG  recordings  were  interpreted  by  a  qualified physician as normal or abnormal. Clinical significance was assessed for all abnormal recordings. For all  studies,  few  subjects  had  12-lead  ECG  recordings  interpreted  as  abnormal  and  none  were considered clinically significant or associated with an adverse event.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No unexpected AE, laboratory abnormalities, changes in vital signs and physical finding were seen during bioequivalence trials (studies OPIMET-004, -005 and -006). As expected, gastrointestinal AEs were  the  main  tolerability  limitation,  although  these  AEs  were  mild  and  do  not  lead  to  treatment discontinuation.  The  limited  provided  data  do  not  suggest  a  different  tolerability  of  the  fixed-dose formulation to be marketed as compared to commercial tablets given separately.

##  Post marketing experience

It is estimated that since the first launch in the US in July 1999 until 31 July 2004 pioglitazone has been cumulatively prescribed to a total of 4,677,000 patients in the U.S., 637,000 patients in Japan since introduction of the product in December 1999 and 330,000 patients in Europe since introduction of the product in November 2000.

A summary of the post-marketing  data  as  presented  in  the  ISS  in  2002  and  then  the  cumulatively reported  events  up  to  31  July  2004  as  presented  in  the  6th  to  10th  PSUR  have  been  provided.  In addition  to  routine  safety  surveillance  performed  within  the  company,  a  pharmacovigilance  plan including  a  number  of  special  studies  and  investigations  to  confirm  the  safety  of  pioglitazone  is  in place  (see  section  Risk  Management  Plan).  Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  pioglitazone  as  judged  by ADR reporting from an estimated 3  million  or  so  patients  from  the  market  up  to  Feb  2002  plus  2 million or further from then up to 31 July 2004 were reassuring and confirmed the safety profile as seen  in  clinical  trials.  No  unexpected  toxicity  of  pioglitazone  was  identified  during  postmarketing experience in these reports.

Recently, 35 cases of macular oedema have been noted in post marketing reports in patients treated with pioglitazone. The information provided by these reports is limited although many cases appear to be associated with peripheral oedema. Most of the reports are from the United States in patients with more advanced disease. Concomitant insulin was used in 14 of 29 of these cases with no information in 6 cases. Pre-existing eye disease was noted in 18 cases with macular oedema in 6 cases, diabetic retinopathy in another 4 cases and no eye disease in one case. It is unclear whether or not there is a direct  association  between  pioglitazone  and  macular  oedema  but  prescribers  should  be  alert  to  the possibility  of  macular  oedema  if  patients  report  disturbances  in  visual  acuity  and  appropriate ophthalmologic referral should be considered. This is reflected in the SPC (sections 4.4 and 4.8) and the  Package  Leaflet  (sections  2  and  4).  This  information  is  in  line  with  the  identical  information introduced into the SPC and PL for Actos via a type II variation adopted 1.6.2006.

On the market, about 30% of pioglitazone therapy is in free combination with Metformin, and only about 30% are as monotherapy. From the spontaneous reports from the market and as observed in the clinical trials with combination therapy as outlined in detail in this ISS, there appears to be no major difference in the ADR profile. The only emerging difference seen is the increase of reports of heart failure,  when  pioglitazone  is  given  in  combination  with  insulin,  and  the  increase  of  reports  of hypoglycaemia when pioglitazone is given in combination with sulfonylureas. The combination with Metformin however, does not yield a shift in ADR profile in the reports from the market.

##  Discussion on clinical safety

The use of Pioglitazone in combination with Metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus was granted with the first marketing authorisation application for pioglitazone, based on the results of one placebo-controlled clinical trial (PNPF-027). Later on, two additional combination therapy clinical trials were performed (Studies PNPF-342 and EC410), confirming previous results and conclusions and providing information on longer-term use of pioglitazone with metformin. A total of 1,785 patients were enrolled in these studies. Of these, 1,312 received pioglitazone as combination therapy with metformin. When pioglitazone was added to an established regimen with metformin given at the maximum tolerated doses, only those specific AEs related to pioglitazone therapy such as oedema and weight gain were reported in a higher rate in this group of patients than in patients treated with other comparators added to metformin based regimen (e.g.. glicazide, placebo). The incidence of oedema in these studies ranged from 2.9% to 11.3% across studies, which was within the expected range. Weight increase was seen in up to 3.5% of patients treated with pioglitazone+metformin as compared to 2.2% in patients treated with glicazide+metformin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety profile of pioglitazone and metformin in combination was the sum of the AE profiles of each product given as monotherapy, with gastrointestinal disorders, weight gain and oedema being the most commonly reported. Neither unexpected AEs nor worsening of the individual AE profiles were seen in any of the clinical trials performed with this combination.

Since the MAA in EU, in November 2002, PSURs have not identified any concern related to a possible interaction leading to a worsening of the safety profile of these products when given in combination, which is relevant considering that up to 30% of pioglitazone use is in combination.

In addition to the above described safety profile of the combination of both active principles, data from the proposed fixed-dose tablet have been provided (studies OPIMET-004, -005, and -006). The limited available data in healthy volunteers do not suggest a different tolerability of the fixed-dose formulation as compared to commercial tablets given separately.  There are no data of administration of this FD tablet to diabetic patients. Although diabetics may suffer from specific gastrointestinal disturbances, it is not expected to result in different tolerability of the new FDC tablet as compared to the old tablets.

Remaining concerns regarding long-term safety and lack of outcome data with thiazolidinediones in general were not addressed by this data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## 6. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The pharmacology of pioglitazone and metformin has been investigated for each drug separately. No preclinical studies of the combination were conducted, which was found to be acceptable by the CHMP. Overall the general pharmacology studies corroborate the information previously available for the individual components and support the combined use.

From the pharmacokinetic point of view, the rat was the most relevant species for non-clinical efficacy and safety studies. In male rats, pioglitazone caused, as a well-known effect, an elevation of the rate of bladder tumours. The relevance of this finding is unknown, and this information has been included in the SPC.

## Efficacy

The efficacy of Competact taken as a tablet of 15 mg pioglitazone and 850 mg metformin twice daily was  sufficiently  demonstrated.  In  the  absence  of  clinical  efficacy  studies  conducted  with  the pioglitazone/metformin fixed-dose combination product, this has been demonstrated by bioequivalence studies and bridging data from clinical trials with the individual components.

The tablet strength and posology approved corresponds to 30 mg pioglitazone and 1700 mg metformin per  day,  respectively.  A  second  tablet  strength  of  15  mg  pioglitazone  and  500  mg  metformin  was retracted by the applicant in April 2006, thus resolving concerns by the CHMP that the resulting daily dose of 1000 mg metformin per day may result in underdosing of this component. The single tablet strength available does not allow for dose titration, which is reflected in the SPC.

## Safety

The safety profile of pioglitazone and metformin in combination was the sum of the adverse event profiles  of  each  product  given  as  monotherapy,  with  gastrointestinal  disorders,  weight  gain  and oedema being the most commonly reported. Neither unexpected AEs nor worsening of the individual AE profiles were seen in any of the clinical trials performed with this combination. Except for reports of macular oedema, no change in the safety profile was derived from the post marketing experience with  pioglitazone  either,  where  usage  is  in  part  as  a  combination  with  metformin.  From  the  safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the SPC. Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

## -User consultation

The applicant committed to perform readability testing of the English Patient Information Leaflet and to report back within two months of marketing authorisation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Risk-benefit assessment

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

-  pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns.
-  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

The fixed  dose  combination  of  pioglitazone  and  metformin  was  considered  justified  by  the  CHMP having the benefit of simplification of therapy thus enhancing compliance with treatment. Taking into account that efficacy has been shown sufficiently for the strength of 15 mg pioglitazone and 850 mg metformin taken twice daily, the benefit/risk ratio was considered positive by the CHMP, provided that  patients  are  titrated  with  pioglitazone  to  the  recommended  dose  of  30mg  daily  before  being switched to Competact.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Competact  in  the  treatment  of  type  2  diabetes  mellitus patients,  particularly  overweight  patients,  who  are  unable  to  achieve  sufficient  glycaemic  control  at their maximally tolerated dose of oral metformin alone, was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
