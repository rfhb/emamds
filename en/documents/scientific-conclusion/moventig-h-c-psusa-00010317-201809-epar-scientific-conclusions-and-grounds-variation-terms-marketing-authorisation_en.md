## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for naloxegol, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Cumulatively 8 reports of gastrointestinal perforation, 2 of which were fatal were reported on Naloxegol. There  was  no  evidence  that  these  patients  suffered  from  terminal  illness.  In  both  of  the  fatal  cases naloxegol was used despite the patient already being at risk of gastrointestinal perforation. As patients at risk of gastrointestinal perforation were excluded from clinical trials the role of naloxegol in contribution of these events cannot be excluded. The PRAC considers that the warning in section 4.4 and section 4.8 of the SmPC should be amended to reflect that cases of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported for naloxegol, some of which have been fatal. As information on Naloxegol in relation to this side effect is now available  the  class  effect  wording  can  hereby  be  replaced.  Furthermore  a  reference  to  the  existing contraindication  on  gastrointestinal  obstruction  should  be  added  to  4.4  of  the  SmPC.  As  there  exists sufficient plausibility based on the mechanism of action of Naloxegol  'GI perforation' should be added to 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency 'not known' and it should be reclassified as an important identified risk in the RMP for Moventig. The package leaflet should be updated accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for naloxegol the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing naloxegol is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
