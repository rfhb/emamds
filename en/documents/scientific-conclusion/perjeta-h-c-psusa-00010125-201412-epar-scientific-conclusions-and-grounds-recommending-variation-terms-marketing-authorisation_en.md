## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for PERTUZUMAB, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows: Pre-clinical and Clinical Trials data document that pertuzumab is associated with diarrhoea. Grade 3/4 diarrhoea is an Important Identified Risk in the Risk Management Plan (toxicity and Clinical Trials data), and a recently published study found the frequency of diarrhoea to be 28.1 % in the pertuzumab vs. 14.2% in the control-arm. Additionaly, grade 3/4 diarrhoea is described in the Summary of Product Characteristics as one of the most common serious adverse drug reactions. In the provided data of events of diarrhoea received from Clinical Trials and Post-Marketing experience, from the 22 patients with reporting grade&gt;3 diarrhoea, only 3 patients were reported to have received treatment for diarrhoea, which is an indicator that further advice to prescribers may be required. Adverse consequences of diarrhoea - notably dehydration and electrolyte imbalance - can be prevented by early institution of anti-diarrhoeal medication, and fluid and electrolyte substitution. In light of the requirement for further advice, it is recommended that a warning regarding 'diarrhoea' should be specifically included in section 4.4 of the Summary of Product Characteristics. The Package Leaflet is to be updated accordingly. Therefore, in view of available data regarding pertuzumab, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were warranted.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.
