## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for BYETTA, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

Rapid weight loss at a rate of &gt;1.5 kg per week is a known risk factor in patients treated with exenatide. Weight loss of this rate may have harmful consequences, such as cholelitiasis. Therefore, in view of available data regarding occurrence of cholelithiasis linked to the rapid weight loss during exenatide treatment, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were warranted.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for BYETTA, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance EXENATIDE is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.
