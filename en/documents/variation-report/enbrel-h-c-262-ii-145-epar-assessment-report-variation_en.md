anercept is a rosis factor receptor (TNFR) fused to the uble receptor, which om binding to their target receptors on Enbrel contains etanercept, which is a tumour necrosis factor- (TNF  ) inhibitor. Et recombinant protein consisting of human p75 tumour nec crystallisable fragment (Fc) of human immunoglobulin G1. Etanercept acts as a sol binds both TNF  and TNFß (lymphotoxin), and prevents them fr the surfaces of cells thus preventing TNF-mediated cellular responses.

Due to the lack of data in these 3 additional JIA subtyp conducted to further characterize them.

## Scope of the variation

The purpose of this variation application is to extend the JIA indication for etanercept to include children and adolescents with extended oligoarticular JIA from the age of 2 years, children and adolescents with enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) from the age of 12 years and children and adolescents with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) from the age of 12 years, together with reclassification of the licensed indication of polyarticular JIA into the ILAR classification of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive) and polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor negative). Furthermore, an additional etanercept dosage regimen of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly (QW) is being proposed in addition to the current approved JIA dosage of 0.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 25 mg per dose) BIW for the treatment of JIA. An etanercept dosage of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose)

These mean concentrations were similar to those seen in adult patients with plaque psoriasis treated with 25 mg etanercept twice-weekly...'. It should also be noted that the dosage regimen used in registry 20021626 was 0.8 maximum dose of 50 mg. This Study 20021626 was an open-label, multicenter r aged 2 to 18 years with a diagnosis of polyarticular-course or systemic JIA. The objecti registry was to determine the long-term safety of etanercept administered with or w compared to MTX alone in paediatric subjects with polyarticular-course or system basis to extend the lower age range for the approved therapeutic in idiopathic arthritis (JIA).

Data in adults have shown that the same total weekly dose provides similar exposure when administered as either QW or BIW doses for both RA and psoriasis. 5 Simulation using data collected in children with JIA shows that QW dosing would be expected to have steady-state peak and trough etanercept concentrations 11% higher and 18% lower, respectively, compared with BIW dosing with a large overlap of concentration profiles at steady state.

A comprehensive population pharmacokinetic analysis of the available data in children has not been performed as was done in adults. Nonetheless, the clinical results of the current studies (3338 and

20021618), in which etanercept was administered at weekly intervals in 0.8 mg/kg the available pharmacokinetic and clin doses, along with ical data in children with JIA and paediatric psoriasis, support the approval of the 0.8 mg/kg QW dosage regimen.

## Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Three (3) changes were made to the planned analyses in the SAP:

- The ACR Pedi response definition used for the reports contained in the CSR was revised after finalization of the SAP. This changed the ACR Pedi 30 response definition from requiring a &gt;30% improvement in 3 of the 6 variables to requiring ≥ 30% improvement in 3 of the 6 variables. The change was also applied to the definitions for the ACR Pedi 50, 70, 90, and 100 responses. The change was made for consistency with the definition in the literature and the

and white (90.55%); however, in the ERA subtype, the majority of subjects were male (78.95%) which is expected. Overall, the majority of subjects in study 3338 were female (56.69%)

Overall, the mean (SD) disease duration was 26.79 (26.44) months with a range of 0.49 to 139.10 months. Prior to the study, all subjects had received at least 1 DMARD except for 2 subjects with ERA who had not received prior DMARDs, and 109 subjects (85.83%) were taking a DMARD at baseline.

In general, the mean and median baseline values for most disease characteristics similar across the 3 JIA subtypes in study 3338 except for those noted below (T were numerically able 4).

Similarly, the mean number of swollen joints was numerically lower in subjects with ERA (3.79 joints) compared t eoJIA and PsA (6.52 and 5.59 joints, respectively). Although some subjects with eo joints at the Baseline visit, they were still required to have a history arthritis aff order to meet the ILAR classification criteria. The mean duration of morning stiffne numerically longer in subject

Mean baseline CRP was numerically higher in subjects with ERA (15.27 mg/L) compared to subjects with eoJIA and PsA (6.27 mg/L and 3.19 mg/L, respectively). Median baseline CRP in subjects with the latter 2 JIA subtypes (1.40 mg/L and 1.00 mg/L for subjects with eoJIA and PsA, respectively) was at, below, or near the lowest limit of detection of 1.00 mg/L. As expected, a greater proportion of subjects with ERA were HLA-B27 positive (68.42%) compared to subjects with eoJIA and PsA (15.00% and 10.34%, respectively). The subjects with eoJIA and PsA who were HLA-B27 positive were either males with arthritis starting before the 6th birthday or females. Therefore, they did not meet the ILAR exclusion criteria for these subtypes.

On the whole, the baseline demographics and disease characteristics are considered to reflect those s proposed. The MAH provided the type of psoriasis lesions of the patients recruited in the study 3338. Of the 29 subjects included in study 0881A1-3338 with a subtypes of JIA for whom the indication i diagnosis of PsA:

-  2 had confirmed guttate psoriasis,
-  19 had confirmed plaque psoriasis,
-  6 subjects with no reported history of skin involvement (presence of psoriasis lesions is not required per the ILAR classification criteria for PsA diagnosis), and
-  2 had an unknown type of psoriasis lesions

In the original protocol, Patients with guttate, pustular, or erythrodermic psoriasis were excluded. However in Protocol Amendment 1, the exclusion of guttate psoriasis was removed. This was because, for subjects with psoriatic arthritis, the skin psoriasis assessments are only secondary measures of clinical benefit. Therefore, the inclusion of subjects with guttate psoriasis would not impact the primary variables of clinical benefit (i.e. ACR PEDI 30 response rate). A total of two subjects with guttate

## Comparison of ACR Pedi 30 Response Rates to Historical Placebo Control Data.

The ACR Pedi 30 response rate at Week 12 for the subjects in this study was compared with the placebo mean composite endpoint response rate from Ruperto et al for the overall population as well as for each of the 3 JIA subtypes (Table 9). The estimates of the treatment effect were similar when the 6 studies included in the meta analysis were pooled and treated as if 1 study (unadjusted) or when the treatment effect was estimated by adjusting for among study differences (adjusted). Generally, the adjusted method is preferred when there are multiple studies in the comparison.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the ERA subtype, the ACR Pedi 30 response rate at Week 12 was also compar response rate from Burgos-Vargas et al (Table 9). All odds ratios and the lower bound of the 95% CI ed with the placebo were greater than 1. Thus, the ACR Pedi 30 response rate at Week 12 in study 3338 was significantly higher than that from historical placebo controls.

## Study 20021618: Open-label Extension Treatment with TNFR:Fc for nts in TNFR:Fc Clinical Trials Participating Patie

## Methods

atment through 10 years, which ell as adult subjects Study 20021618 was an open-label study of long-term etanercept tre included paediatric subjects who had previously participated in study 16.0016 as w who had previously participated in double-blind rheumatoid arthritis studies.

## In the below text only data from the paediatric subjects with JIA are presented.

## Study Participants

All paediatric subjects with DMARD-refractory, polyarticular-course JIA (polyarticular-, pauciarticular-, or systemic-onset) who had been enrolled in the initial etanercept study 16.0016, had not had any clinically significant adverse events thought to be due to etanercept, and who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria per the protocol were eligible to enrol in study 20021618. Per the inclusion criteria for the initial study 16.0016, patients were to be between 4 and 17 years of age at the time of enrollment. Furthermore, the inclusion criteria for entry into the study 16.0016 required a diagnosis of

## Objectives

The primary objectives of study 20021618 were:

- bjects with disease-modifying atic drug (DMARD)-refractory JIA; and 1. to evaluate the long-term safety of etanercept in su antirheum
2. to evaluate improvement in physical function/disability and quality of life.

The secondary objective was to evaluate long-term efficacy of etanercept.

## Outcomes/endpoints

ary endpoint in paediatric subjects is ACR Pedi 30 (referred to provement [JRA-DOI 30]) at month is defined as an improvement of at least 30% from baseline in at least 3 of the 6 criteria of the Criteria, and a worsening of greater than 30% in not more than 1 of the following 6 criteria from baseline: In terms of efficacy evaluation, the prim in the CSR as the juvenile rheumatoid arthritis 30% definition of im 3, and JIA Core Set of Response

6. Erythrocyte sedimentation factor (ESR).

However, terminology for the of response in patients with JIA that was current at the time the protocol for study 20021618 was prepared was JRA-DOI; however, the newer terminology (i.e., ACR Pedi) is used herein for consistency. The change in terminology from JRA-DOI to ACR Pedi resulted from the variable being renamed and not due to changes in any of the components that make up the composite index. With the exception of the use of ESR, these criteria are the same as that used in study 3338. the acute phase reactant was changed to CRP after year 1 in study 20021618. The assessment

## ACR Pedi 30, ACR Pedi 50, and ACR Pedi 70 Responses at Yearly Timepoints Through 10 Years

The proportion of paediatric subjects in study 20021618 achieving ACR Pedi 30, ACR Pedi 50, and ACR Pedi 70 responses remained relatively stable over 10 years (Table 30). Similar results were observed for ACR Pedi 90 and ACR Pedi 100.

## Individual Components of the ACR Pedi Response Variable

As was observed for the ACR Pedi response rates, the individual components of remained relatively stable over time through 10 years (Table 31). However, the in the mean % improvement in CRP in the later years of the s the ACR Pedi response re was some fluctuation tudy because of outlier data and the limited number of patients contributing data (18 or less after year 7). As expected, the median % change showed much less fluctuation over the 10-year duration of the study.

## Pain Assessment on Visual Analog Scale

The change from baseline in pain assessment remained relatively stable over t some fluctuation because ime, although there was of outlier data and the limited number of subjects contributing data in the later years (Table 32). Although there was a large amount of variability in the mean changes from baseline due to outliers, the median changes from baseline were relatively stable through year 7 after which time there was also fluctuation in the median percent improvement most likely due to the small number of subjects assessed in year 8 (n=4), year 9 (n=2), and year 10 (n=1).

## Persistence of Efficacy and/or Tolerance Effects

dy 20021618 in subjects with JIA hrough 10 years of time) from longas not studied in either The 10-years efficacy results from the long-term extension stu presented in the preceding sections demonstrate persistence of efficacy over time, t treatment. There was no evidence of tolerance (i.e., loss of therapeutic effect over term treatment with etanercept in study 20021618. Withdrawal of etanercept w study 3338 or 20021618.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

In view of the fact that rheumatoid factor positive and rheumatoid factor negative polyarthritis will now replace polyarticular JIA in section 4.1 of the SmPC, the MAH provided an overview of efficacy results from previous JIA trials; study 16.0016 part 1 and part 2. study 20021618 and registry 20021626

for all RF positive and RF negative polyarthritis subjects.

In general, both subtypes demonstrated efficacy that articular-course JIA lyarthritis JIA and RFassessment of the presence or absenc were consistent with that reported in the original study reports for the overall poly population, thereby supporting the inclusion of the indication for RF-negative po positive polyarthritis JIA in the SmPC.

In CSR from the open label study 2 was also provided. The majority of subjects in study 20021618 reflect the ILA polyarticular JIA (RF positive and RF negative).

The overall study plan for the open-label study 3338 is acceptable. While a double-blind randomised rt efficacy of etanercept in the subtypes of JIA studies namely eoJIA, ERA and PSA. controlled study is the standard design to show efficacy, the comparison with placebo for the same subtypes using historical control can be accepted to suppo

The open-label etanercept period of study 16.0016 in JIA subjects reported by Lovell et al paper referred to polyarticular-course JRA regardless of subtype.

The comparison of the results in subpopulations showed that within each ACR Pedi response level for ACR Pedi 30, ACR Pedi 50, and ACR Pedi 70, the percentages of subjects in each age group who achieved responses at Week 12 were generally similar. This important information on ACR Pedi scores by age group is supportive of the entire data from 3338 and shows that response to etanercept is similar across the different age categories presented.

## Study 20021618

The use of the newer terminology of ACR Pedi is accepted in view of the minor differences between the older scoring technique of JRA-DOI (VAS scales and CRP versus ESR). With the introduction of the CRP in study 20021618 the MAH plan to use ACR Pedi is acceptable.

80-90% of subjects s difference is likely to reflect the lack of well established DMARDs for use in specific subjects enrolled 100% of patients in study 20021618 with JIA were on DMARDs as compared with in study 3338.

The MAH has attempted to address this lack of information by interaction with the two European biological registries which include children with JIA; in Germany and in the UK. Since 2009, the German JIA registry has collected data on disease activity specifically the set of criteria for inactive disease and remission as defined by Wallace et al.

## Conclusion on clinical efficacy

In view of the rarity of JIA subtypes and the well established use of etanercept in p open-label single arm design of study 3338 is considered acceptable and in terms o effect, the comparison with historical controls for placebo is accepted. It is of note procedure for variation II/126 (which approved the extension of the lower age ran JIA from 4 years to 2 years) was accepted on the basis of an ope olyarticular JIA, the f assessment of that during the ge for polyarticular n label study (20021626) and ancillary analysis of the subgroup aged 2 to &lt;4 years.

As JIA has been re-classified by ILAR into 8 clear mutually exclusive subtypes, a has been licensed from the age of 2 years in polyarticular course JIA; this additiona beneficial and an update to the SmPC with the results from study 3338 and the long-term extensi study 20021618 is endorsed. Efficacy in 5 out of 8 of the subtypes of JIA is consid shown and as such these patients, if they fail conventional therapy and are seve significant immunosuppression, are likely to benefi

While the MAH position that persistence of efficacy through 10 years has been shown, it is considered difficult to draw any firm conclusions from the efficacy data presented from 8 years onwards in view of the small numbers treated at those time points. While withdrawal of etanercept was not studied in either study presented in this variation procedure, when and how to withdraw etanercept from patients who have responded and have no active disease remains an important area of missing information. In order to address this issue the MAH has amended the long-term safety study B1801023 to include the collection of data on CID/remission rates, and success rate of re-treatment upon disease relapse in subjects with eoJIA, ERA and PsA subtypes. Further data on efficacy and remission is planned to be collected from registries, as described in the RMP.

No large differences were observed across JIA subtypes although a higher rate of abdominal pain and diarrhoea was seen in the ERA subtype but the numbers were small and at present there is no evidence of a JIA subtype-related safety signal. However further safety data will become available with Part 2 of study 3338. The overall exposureadjusted rate of TEAEs, excluding infections and ISRs, across all 3 JIA subtypes was 3.74 events per subject-year: 2.77 events per subject-year for eoJIA, 5.48 events per subject-year for ERA, and 3.43 events per subject-year for PsA. Forty-five (45) subjects (35.4%) reported at least 1 treatment-emergent adver excluding infections and ISRs, in study 3338 through 12 weeks (Table 35). The m reported in the overall population were headache (7 subjects, 5.5%), followed by abdominal pain, and diar

## All Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in Study 20021618

Per the protocol for study 20021618, nonserious adverse events were to be collected only during year 1 of the 10-year study.

The exposure-adjusted rate of TEAEs during year 1 of study 20021618 (the primary safety endpoint), including infections and ISRs, was 798.50 events per 100 subject-years (Table 36). The most common TEAEs reported were injection site reaction (112 events, 210.93 events per 100 subject-years), upper respiratory infection (68 events, 128.06 events per 100 subject years), headache (44 events, 82.86 events per 100 subject-years), and abdominal pain (20 events, 37.67 events per 100 subject-years). Fifty (50) paediatric subjects (86.2%) reported at least 1 TEAE during year 1 of the study.

The most common treatment-emergent infections were upper r infection (18 subjects, 14.2%), followed by pharyngitis (15 subjects, 11.8%), 6.3%), gastroenteritis (5 subjects, 3.9%), and bronchitis (4 subjects, 3.1%). No clin differences were observed across JIA subtypes. The overall exposure-adjusted rate emergent infections across all 3 JIA subtypes was 3.33 e It is noted that the small numbers involved preclude any firm conclusions rate in each subtypes will become available with part 2 of the study.

## Study 20021618

Per the protocol for study 20021618, nonserious infections were to be collected only during year 1 of the 10-year study.

The exposure-adjusted rate of treatment-emergent infections in paediatric subjects during year 1 of study 20021618 was 237.29 events per 100 subject-years (Table 38). The most common treatmentemergent infections reported were upper respiratory infection (68 events, 128.06 events per 100 subject-years), pharyngitis (9 events, 16.95 events per 100 subject years), and flu syndrome (9 events, 16.95 events per 100 subject-years). Forty-four (44) paediatric subjects (75.9%) reported at least 1 treatment-emergent infection during year 1 of the study.

## Serious Infections

## Study 3338

There were 3 serious infections reported during Part 1 of study 3338: 1 eoJIA sub bronchopneumonia, 1 eoJIA subject with gastroenteritis, and 1 PsA subject w ject with ith pyelocystitis.

## Study 20021618

Throughout t he 10-year study, 11 serious infections were reported in 8 paediatric subjects (13.8%). 10 years in study 20021618 was 3.22 events per 100 subject-years (Table 43). All of the serious infection terms occurred in only 1 paediatric subject each, with the exception of the preferred term of infection (verbatim terms of soft tissue infection and post operative wound infection) which occurred in 2 subjects (3.4%).

Two (2) subjects were withdrawn from investigational product due to treatment-emergent infections, both of which met seriousness criteria:

- to ubject was hospitalized and received antiinfectives. The the investigator to be 1. A 6-year-old female with eoJIA, was withdrawn from investigational product due bronchopneumonia on Day 38. The s treatment-emergent infection resolved without sequelae, and was considered by mild and unrelated to investigational product.
- male with PsA was withdrawn from investigational product due to pyelocystitis on nfection resolved and unrelated to 2. A 17-year-old fe Day 52. She was hospitalized and received anti-infectives. The treatment-emergent i within 7 days without sequelae, and was considered by the investigator to be mild investigational product.

## Study 20021618

The exposure-adjusted rate of adverse events leading to withdrawal in paediatric subjects through 10 years in study 20021618 was 2.05 events per 100 subject-years (Table 46). Throughout the 10-year study, 7 adverse events leading to withdrawal were reported in 3 paediatric subjects (5.2%). However, there were 2 additional paediatric subjects who were noted to have withdrawn from the study for adverse events that were not captured in the above-noted table in the CSR: JRA flare in 1 subject, and

No grade 4 laboratory toxicities were reported. Three (3) paediatric subjects experienced a Grade 3 ese subjects had any decrease in hemoglobin throughout the 10 years of study 20021618. None of th additional grade 3 hemoglobin results during the study.

## Subjects with Liver Function Test Abnormalities

## Study 3338

A total of 12 subjects (9.5%) had increased liver function test (LFT) values, with 9 subjects (7.1%) reporting &gt;2x to ≤ 3x upper limit of normal (ULN) LFT values and 3 subjects (2.4%) reporting &gt;3x ULN LFT values (Table 48). No clinically meaningful differences were observed across JIA subtypes.

## Study 20021618

During study 20021618, samples for clinical laboratory analyses were to be collected at screening, baseline, and every 3 months for the first 12 months, every 4 months from month 12 to month 48, and then every 6 months thereafter. However, samples were only reported up to month 52 as the data became sparse after this timepoint. No grade 4 laboratory toxicities were reported. Three (3) paediatric subjects experienced a Grade 3 decrease in haemoglobin throughout the 10 years of study 20021618.

## Immunological events

## Anti-etanercept Antibodies

## Study 3338

Seven (7) subjects tested positive for anti-etanercept antibodies at either Week withdrawal: 5 subjects had ERA and 2 had PsA (Table 51). None of the subjects 12 or upon early who were positive for anti-etanercept antibodies tested positive for neutralizing antibodies. Three (3) subjects were missing either the baseline or Week-12 anti-etanercept antibody sample; therefore, no results are presented for these subjects. The presence of anti-etanercept antibodies did not adversely affect efficacy at Week 12. Of the 7 subjects with anti-etanercept antibodies, 6 met ACR Pedi 30 response criteria at Week 12. Six (6) of the 7 subjects who tested positive for anti-etanercept antibodies experienced TEAEs, including infections and ISRs. One (1) of these subjects experienced an SAE of abdominal pain. No serious infections were reported in the subjects who tested positive for anti-etanercept antibodies.

## Study 20021618

Although the measurement of anti-etanercept antibodies was included as a safety endpoint in the protocol for study 20021618, no anti-etanercept antibody analysis was done. As testing for ADA le due to lack of ore than 10 years requires comparison between samples and the baseline level, this will not be possib samples/insufficient evidence of sample stability for the baseline samples taken m ago.

## Postmarketing Experience in Etanercept-treated Patients Under 18 Years of Age

The most frequently reported serious, medically confirmed events in juvenile etanercept users (age 1 to 17 years; all indications) differed when compared with the most frequently reported events for all users combined. Among all juvenile etanercept users, 'condition aggravated' (flares or worsening of the indication for use or of a pre-existing condition), pyrexia, uveitis, and injection site reactions were the most frequently reported serious events. Fever and uveitis are often associated with JIA itself and fever often accompanies common childhood illnesses. In addition to condition aggravated, the most frequently reported nonserious, medically confirmed events in this age group included various injection site reactions, drug ineffective, and pyrexia. There have been postmarketing reports of pyrexia, uveitis

Moreover, 11 serious infections were reported in 8 paediatric subjects (one case of sepsis was reported) in the study 20021618. Serious infections with etanercept treatment are a risk that is highlighted in the SmPC and also in view of the well known side effect profile, etanercept is restricted for use in children when other treatment options have failed. Regarding SAEs, four (4) subjects (3.1%) reported SAEs in the study 3338, of them, infections none was related to etanercept accordin

The beneficial effects of etanercept in 5 subtypes of JIA has been demonstrated in 2 arm trials. Etanercept is already licensed for polyarticular JIA from the age of 2 years (the study group which were included in the submitted clinical data in support of this licensed indica by the ILAR criteria as polyarthritis (RF positive) and polyarthritis (RF negative)).

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The exposure in the specific subtypes of JIA is limited and further data from the final week 96 CSR from study 3338 should provide more information on the safety profile.

An important area of missing information remains; namely when to cease treatment in a responding subject. While this problem was discussed at length with the MAH during variation II/126 (extension of

In view of the unmet medical need for subjects with the 3 additional subtypes of JIA (eoJIA from age 2 years, ERA from age 12 yrs and PsA from age 12 years) who have active disease unresponsive to methotrexate or conventional therapy, or who are intolerant to methotrexate, the advantages of treatment with etanercept are considered to outweigh the safety concerns.
