The main adverse reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia). These events have often been transitory. Late onset neurological disorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether such neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown. These findings should be considered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, that present with severe clinical findings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings. These findings do not affect current national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission of HIV.   |

A position statement on the use of antiretroviral therapy to reduce HIV transmission was published by the British HIV Association (BHIVA) in January 2013. As a consequence, the recommendations for post- exposure prophylaxis have also been changed in recently |

Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity of this worksharing to update the PL with the details of the local representatives for Croatia and to introduce the Croatian language annexes for Emtriva and to update the bottle label to include the EDQM short standard term for the pharmaceutical form for Stribild. C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation   |            |     | updated HIV treatment guidelines. For example, the 2013 BHIVA guideline does not generally recommend post- exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after exposure from a patient with well treated HIV. Based on these data, the wording on the risk of transmission for HIV products was revised to reflect the current scientific knowledge. While effective suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines.   |

| WS/0391 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order to update the safety information regarding autoimmune disorders in relation to Immune Reactivation Syndrome, following a class labelling for antiretrovirals as requested by the CHMP. The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. In addition, the WSA took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. Furthermore, Annex II is being brought in line with | 30/05/2013 | 01/07/2013 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | Upon review of safety data and literature on immune disorders in association with antiretrovirals for the treatment of HIV, the CHMP considered that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that immune reconstitution syndrome (IRS) after antiretroviral therapy may be associated with autoimmune disease/disorders even if the number of case reports is limited. Therefore, the CHMP had requested the inclusion of information on immune disorders under immune reconstitution as a class labelling for all antiretrovirals for the treatment of HIV. |

| II/0074 | Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to include a recommendation not to discontinue Emtriva in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis. Update of section 4.8 to add angioedema. Furthermore, following CHMP request this section was fully revised to be in line with the SmPC guideline. Sections 3 and 4 of the PL were updated accordingly. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 22/07/2010 | 26/08/2010 | SmPC and PL | Emtricitabine shows clinical and in vitro activity against HBV. Post-treatment hepatic flares were reported following discontinuation of emtricitabine. Therefore, section 4.4 of the SmPC was updated to not to discontinue Emtriva in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis since post treatment exacerbations of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. The term 'angioedema', was included in section 4.8 following a review of angioedema. This review was submitted by the MAH for Truvada (emtricitabine/tenofovir DF) and identified two cases of angioedema with Truvada, with indirect evidence of a causal association with emtricitabine (a negative rechallenge to the tenofovir component of Truvada). In addition, there were four cases of a positive rechallenge to Truvada which should also be considered as possibly causally related, as the positive result could have been in response to either the tenofovir DF or the emtricitabine component.

The frequency category of uncommon was estimated from a statistical calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to emtricitabine in these clinical studies. Furthermore, following CHMP request the MAH has compiled a summary of the safety data supporting each ADR term in Section 4.8 of the Emtriva SmPC, which were previously submitted and approved by the CHMP. All ADRs (except angioedema) currently in section 4.8, were identified in the pivotal clinical HIV studies for Emtriva (in adults), and were included in the SmPC at the time of authorisation. Section 4.8 was fully revised to be in line with the SmPC guideline.   |

| II/0044   | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Update of section 4.8 of the SPC and section 4 of the PL to list anaemia as an adverse drug reaction to emtricitabine treatment in adult patients, as requested by the CHMP in March 2007. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 19/07/2007   | 22/08/2007 | SmPC and PL | In a cumulative review of anaemia cases in adult patients on treatment with emtricitabine, 28 cases were identified up to 19 June 2006. Based on these cases a causal relationship between emtricitabine and anaemia was reasonably suspected. However, detailed description of the analysis performed in adult study data was needed to draw a definitive conclusion. The additional data provided from 3 trials suggested that emtricitabine can cause Grade 1 and Grade 2 anaemia, which occurs in between 0.5 and 1.0% of patients. Based on the available data, it was agreed to add \"anaemia\" to the list of uncommon adverse reactions to emtricitabine treatment in adult patient. Anaemia was already listed as common adverse reaction with emtricitabine treatment in paediatric patients. |

| II/0040   | Update of sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SPC to reflect results of a study evaluating the pharmacokinetics and safety of emtricitabine in neonates and young infants over the first 3 months of life, at CHMP request further to the assessment of this study in November 2006. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics | 22/03/2007   | 25/04/2007 | SmPC | An open label pharmacokinetic study of emtricitabine over the first 3 months of life following multiple dose administration in children born to HIV 1 infected mothers was completed by 20 of the 22 neonates enrolled. All the 20 neonates received two 4-day courses of emtricitabine oral solution between the first week of life and 3 months of age at a dose level of 3 mg/kg once daily (half of the approved dose for infants aged more than 4 months). Results showed that steady state clearance increased with age over the first 3 months of life and AUC decreased in parallel. Moreover, plasma emtricitabine exposure (AUC) in infants up to 3 months of age who received 3 mg/kg emtricitabine once daily was similar to that observed using 6 mg/kg daily doses in HIV-infected adults and children aged 4 months and over.

Furthermore, it is also mentioned that there is no efficacy data and only very few data in terms of safety are available for infants aged below 4 months.

| II/0039 | Update of sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SPC in regard of the potential Hepatitis B Virus reactivation after treatment discontinuation with emtricitabine. Section 4.4 is updated to not recommend the concomitant use with other products containg emtricitabine or lamivudine. Section 4.8, in line with the MedDRA - system organ class, was updated with regards nervous system disorders and psychiatric disorders.The PL has been updated accordingly. The MAH has amended the SPC, Annex II, labelling and the PL in line with the latest QRD templates and have introduced minor linguistic changes to the some EU languages, as relevant. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, | 22/02/2007 | 27/03/2007 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | The results of an evaluation of post-treatment exacerbations of hepatitis performed by the MAH across 3 randomised, double-blind clinical trials of emtricitabine in patients with chronic hepatitis B were discussed in an article by Mondou et al, in Clinical Infectious Diseases, 2005; 41(5): e45-47. Based on these results the Company Core Safety Information for Emtriva was updated and now the SPC to specify that hepatitis B virus reactivation after discontinuation of treatment with emtricitabine could lead to more severe liver disease, including hepatic decompensation and liver failure. The fact that Emtriva should not be taken with any other medicinal product containing emtricitabine or lamivudine, including fixed combination products has been included in section 4.4 of the SPC and section 2 of the PL. |

| II/0038   | Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC and section 2 of the PL to implement the class labelling text on osteonecrosis, agreed by the CHMP in September 2006. Section 6 of the PL was updated with the local representatives in Bulgaria and Romania and in Belgium and Luxembourg. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   | 14/12/2006   | 12/01/2007   | SmPC and PL   | Cases of osteonecrosis (death of the bone tissue resulting from an insufficient blood supply) have been reported in HIV-infected patients since the end of the 80's. Although the cause of this disease could be due to multi factors (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index) it has occurred specially in patients with HIV advanced disease and/or in patients with long term use of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Further to the review of all available data the CHMP agreed that this information should now be included in the SPC and PL of all antiretroviral medicinal products. Patients should be warned to seek medical advice in case they experience joint stiffness, aches and pain especially of the hip, knee and shoulder or if they experienced any difficulty in movement.   |

The provided data further substantiates the use of emtricitabine in HIV-1 infected children older than 4 months and the viral suppression achieved throughout the 48 weeks (89% achieved < 400 copies/ml and 77% < 50 copies/ml). A part from anaemia and skin discolouration commonly and very commonly, respectively reported in paediatric population, the pattern of adverse events reported in theses three studies is comparable with the already known for adult patients. Sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC and section 4 of the PL have been updated to reflect this data.   |

| II/0013 | To update section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC and section 2 of the PL, to implement the class labelling text regarding the Immune Reactivation Syndrome, as adopted by the CHMP. In addition the Greek PL was amended regarding spelling corrections. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 18/11/2004 | 17/12/2004 | SmPC | In patients treated with any type of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections may occur, when the immune system responds to treatment. In most cases, the inflammatory reactions towards the opportunistic pathogens in question cannot be foreseen since the opportunistic infection has not yet been detected/diagnosed. If diagnosed prior to institution of CART, the treatment against the opportunistic infection (OI) is usually given priority. In particular, this is true for the complications most feared in this context; CMV- retinitis, generalised mycobacterial infections and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. An additional reason for treating the OI and the HIV-infection sequentially, is the great risk of adverse events (toxicity or lack of effect) due to drug interactions. The clinical consequence of the reactivation of the immune system in patients starting CART cannot be prevented and the early recognition and diagnose of these inflammatory reaction is considering to be important to the clinical |

| II/0005 | Update of section 4.4 of the SPC and section 2 of the PL, to implement the class labelling text regarding the mitochondrial toxicity in children with in utero and post-natal exposure to Nucleotide/Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs), as adopted by the CPMP. In addition, section 6.4 of the SPC and sections 5 and 6 of the PL were updated in line with the latest EMEA/QRD templates. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 26/03/2004 | 23/06/2004 | SmPC and PL | The issue of mitochondrial toxicity in children of in utero and/ or post-natal exposure to NRTIs was first raised in 1999 following the identification of 8 cases of mitochondrial dysfunction in uninfected children included in a clinical trial. The MAHs for all NRTIs were asked to provide preclinical data on the mitochondrial toxicity and a review of adverse events potentially attributable to mitochondrial toxicity in children exposed in utero and / or post-natally to NRTIs. Following the assessment of the submitted data and discussions held at the PhVWP and CPMP, a class labelling wording was agreed by the CPMP in November 2003 to be implemented in all NRTIs product information. In addition, the storage conditions in section 6.4 of the SPC and section 5 of the PL were updated in line with EMEA/QRD templates. The list of the local representatives for the current European Members States and for the 10 new accession Members was introduced in section 6 of the PL. |
