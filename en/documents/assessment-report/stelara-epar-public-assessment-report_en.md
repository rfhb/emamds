## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Psoriasis  is  one  of  the  most  common  human  skin  diseases  and  affects  2  to  3%  of  the  general population. It is a complex disorder, characterized by inflammation, increased keratinocyte hyperproliferation,  and  an  altered  epidermal  differentiation  population.  Substantial  evidence  exists indicating that  T-lymphocytes,  macrophages,  and  certain  cytokines  play  a  major  role  in  the pathogenesis of the disease.

Interleukin (IL)-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine consisting of 2 disulfide-linked glycosylated subunits, designated p35 and p40.  The p40 protein subunit of IL-12 can also associate with a 19.8 kilodalton protein, p19, to form a novel cytokine, IL-23. It is thought that IL-12 induces proliferation of naïve Tcell populations, and IL-23 is stimulatory to memory T-cell populations.

IL-12  is  produced  primarily  by  antigen  presenting  cells,  which  play  a  key  role  in  promoting  Th1 responses.  Th1  cells  are  characterized  by  their  secretion  of  interferon.  Th1  cells  also  promote  both cell-mediated immunity, and the synthesis of complement-fixing antibody isotypes.

Recently,  a  neutralizing  antibody  to  IL-12  has  been  found  to  abolish  the  formation  of  psoriaform lesions in a murine model of the disease. IL-12 has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of a psoriasis-like skin disorder in severe combined immunodeficiency disorders (SCID) mice.

The present application for marketing authorisation of Stelara is made under Article 8.3 and concerns a new active substance,  ustekinumab, for which a complete dossier has been submitted.

The applied indication for STELARA was for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults  who  have  had  an  inadequate  response  to,  or  who  have  a  contraindication  to,  or  who  are intolerant  to  systemic  therapy  (e.g.  cyclosporin,  methotrexate  or  psoralen  plus  ultra-violet  A  light [PUVA]).

Stelara  has  been  approved  in  the  following  restricted  indication:  'treatment  of    adult  patients  with moderate  to  severe  chronic  plaque  psoriasis  who  have  failed  to  respond  to,  or  who  have  a contraindication  to,  or  are  intolerant  to  other  systemic  therapies  including  ciclosporin,  methotrexate and PUVA'.

Stelara  is  presented  as  a  solution  for  subcutaneous  injection  and  is  supplied  in  glass  vials  with  a stopper and flip-off cap. It is manufactured in two dosages, a 45 mg vial (0.5 mL) and 90 mg vial (1.0 mL).

Stelara  is  a  fully  humanised  monoclonal  antibody  composed of  an IgG1 heavy chain isotype and a kappa light chain isotype with an approximate molecular weight of 148,600 Daltons.  ustekinumab binds with high affinity and specificity to a 40 kilo Dalton (kDa) human protein that is a subunit of both  interleukin  (IL)-12  and  IL-23  heterodimeric  cytokines.  This  subunit  is  called  IL-12/23p40. ustekinumab neutralises IL-12 and IL-23 bioactivity by binding to IL-12/23p40 and preventing IL-12 and IL-23 binding to the IL-12R β 1 receptor protein expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) or T cells. Through this mechanism of action,  ustekinumab neutralizes IL-12 (Th1) and IL-23 (Th17) mediated  cellular  responses.  Abnormal  regulation  of  IL-12  and  IL-23  has  been  associated  with  a variety  of  immune-mediated  human  diseases,  including  psoriasis,  Crohn's  disease,  rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and others.

ustekinumab has been studied clinically in patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, subjects were given single doses of  ustekinumab via intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) routes of administration at doses up to 4.5 mg/kg and 2.7 mg/kg, respectively. In addition, multiple fixed SC doses of ustekinumab have been  administered  at  doses  up  to  180  mg  per  week.  The  recommended  dose  of  ustekinumab  for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

psoriasis patients is 45 mg administered SC at weeks 0 and 4, then every 12 weeks thereafter.  A dose of 90 mg may be used in patients with a body weight greater than 100 kg.

An application for a marketing authorisation is pending in the United States of America where it was originally submitted in November 2007.

There were two Scientific Advice procedures. The first from February to May 2005 and the second from August to October 2006.

The Applicant's procedures  appear  compliant  with  GMP,  GLP  and  GCP.  Stelara  drug  substance  is manufactured  at  Centocor  Biologics,  LLC  4777  LeBourget  Drive  St.  Louis,  MO  63134  USA. Manufacture of Stelara final vialed product (FVP) is performed at Cilag AG Hochstrasse 201 8205 Schaffhausen.

Release and stability testing of the  ustekinumab FVP is performed at Centocor B.V. Einsteinweg 101 2333 CB Leiden The Netherlands.

The pivotal non-clinical toxicity studies were all reported to be GLP-compliant. Some deviations from GLP have been documented but none is considered to have invalidated any of the studies involved.

Some deviations from GCP (including a serious breach in blinding at one site in the comparator trial with  etanercept-  affecting  one  patient  in  the  UK)  were  noted  but  were  not  considered  to  affect  the overall quality of the data as analysis of the data.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

ustekinumab is expressed in Sp2/0 murine myeloma cell line using a protein-free, chemically defined cell culture medium and purified by a series of affinity and ion exchange chromatographic steps and viral inactivation steps.

The drug substance is formulated with L-histidine, sucrose and polysorbate 80 and water for injection.

ustekinumab is presented as a concentrated solution for injection containing 90 mg/ml  ustekinumab in two doses, a 45 mg vial (0.5 mL) and 90 mg vial (1.0 mL).

## Active Substance

## Description of the drug substance

ustekinumab is a fully humanised IgG1k monoclonal antibody comprised of 1326 aminoacid residues with two identical heavy and light chains linked by covalent disulfide bonds and non-covalent heavyheavy and heavy-light chain interactions.

ustekinumab contains a single N-linked glycosylation site at the Asp 299 aminoacid residue of each heavy  chain.  The  major  source  of  molecular  weight  and  charge  heterogeneity  is  due  to  posttranslational modifications caused by different glycoforms and partial loss of the C-terminal lysine.

ustekinumab has a total molecular weight of approximately 148,600 Da.

-  Manufacture

The  drug  substance  is  manufactured  at  Centocor  Biologics,  LLC,  St  Louis,  Missouri,  USA.  in accordance to current EU Good Manufacturing practices (GMP), with standard operating procedures in place to describe all procedures and controls.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ustekinumab  formulated  bulk  (FB)  is  manufactured  by  continuous  perfusion  cell  culture.  After preculture, expansion of the cell culture, ustekinumab is harvested and purified by a combination of affinity and ion exchange chromatography steps and other steps to inactivate or remove potential virus contamination  (solvent/detergent  [S/D]  treatment  and  virus  removal  filtration).  Final  steps  of  the manufacturing process include the preparation of the ustekinumab pre-formulated bulk (PFB) and FB.

## Cell line development

Sp2/0 host cell were transfected to express ustekinumab. These cells do not synthesize heavy or light chains proteins. The cells were seeded to adapt growth in protein free chemically defined media.

## Development genetics

Splenocytes from mice immunised with human Il-12 and Ag653 mouse myeloma cells were fused to create  hybridomas using a standard technology. The hybridoma cell line C340A expressing an anti human Il-12 was identified and subcloned. A library of DNA fragments was prepared from genomic DNA to clone  ustekinumab  heavy  and  light  chain  genes.  The  bacteriophage  from  the  library  were mixed  with  an  E.coli  strain  and  the  pure  bacterophage  clones  of  interest  were  obtained  by  DNA hybridization.

The  DNA  inserts  were  transferred  from  the  bacteriophage  vectors  to  a  pSV2gpt-based  expression vector suitable for transfection in mouse myeloma cells C463A cells. The transfection was performed by electroporation. After three rounds of subcloning, the line C743B showed better growth and IgG titre and was chosen as the candidate to establish a MCB.

## Cell bank system

A two-tiered cell  banking  system  of  Master  Cell  bank  (MCB)  and  Working  Cell  Bank  (WCB)  has been developed and maintained in accordance to GMP and ICH Q5D guidelines.

A MCB was prepared from the development cell bank (DCB). Each WCB is generated from the MCB. Two WCBs are currently available, one serves as a primary source of production and the second as a backup. A new WCB will be generated periodically to ensure continuous supply for manufacturing.

Two vials of the development bank were thawed and the MCB was obtained following culture and sub-culture of cells in suspension in a selective medium.  The WCB was prepared from MCB, using the same procedures as the described for the MCB.

Procedures  followed  in  the  preparation  of  MCB  and  WCB  have  been  appropriately  described.  An extensive  range  of  tests  has  been  performed  for  their  characterisation,  in  accordance  with  ICH guidelines, including purity, identity, presence of retrovirus and endogenous agents as well as potential non-endogenous and adventitious agents.

## Preculture and expansion and bioreactor production

One or more cryovials of C743B WCB are thawed and diluted with chemically defined medium.  The preculture is expanded sequentially in a series of culture flasks and culture bags as mechanism to scale up for inoculation of the seed reactor.

The content of the seed reactor is transferred into the production bioreactor. Continuous perfusion is initiated and culture is drawn from the bioreactor into a cell retention system to separate cells from the permeate. The permeate is filtered and collected as harvest in bioprocess containers. The continuous perfusion cell culture continues up to 60 days post-inoculation.

Cell culture conditions and in-process controls are tested during the culture expansion and at the end of the production.

## Purification process

The  purification process of the cell harvest consist of the following purification  and virus removal/inactivation steps:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Affinity chromatography
- -S/D treatment
- -Cation exchange chromatography
- -Anion exchange chromatography
- -Virus removal filtration
- -Concentration by ultrafiltration and diafiltration
- The formulated bulk is prepared by addition of polysorbate 80.

In-process controls are performed in many steps during the purification process.

The upstream manufacturing and purification processes and controls in place for the drug substance are described, including description of the elution buffers, exchange buffers, column regeneration and storage  conditions.  Validation  data  for  the  production  processes  of  the  drug  substance  has  been provided and the capacity of the process to remove DNA, host cell protein, residual Protein A and cell culture additives has also been suitably validated.

## Manufacturing process development and validation

The commercial bulk drug substance manufacturing process for Stelara was developed over time to yield a process that is robust, consistent and appropriate for commercial manufacturing.

A  comprehensive  analytical  control  strategy  was  employed  throughout  development  in  order  to monitor effects of process changes. Whenever significant process changes were made, an additional batch of Reference Standard was manufactured and characterized as part of the comparability program for Stelara. A detailed discussion of the data showing process and product comparability throughout development was provided.

The changes to the drug substance manufacturing process during development include change in the site of manufacture, scale-up, chromatographic resins and changes in the filters, elimination of animal derived raw materials and changes in the dosage form. Viral safety capacity was improved.

The approaches used to assess the comparability of Stelara after implementation of specific changes included  a  retrospective  analysis  of  the  structural  integrity  of  the  molecule,  an  evaluation  of  its biological functionality, and a comparison of the stability data and degradation profiles.

The  applicant  performed  two  separate  comparability  exercises  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  changes made  in  the  manufacturing  process  for  the  final  bulk  did  not  affect  the  structural  and  functional integrity of  ustekinumab.

The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  through  manufacturing  scale  validation  batches  and representative reduced-scale studies. All process validation and evaluation data demonstrate that the final bulk manufacturing process operates in a consistent and robust state of control and yields product that  reliably  meets  predetermined  criteria  for  quality.  All  analytical  methods  used  for  process validation and evaluation have been qualified. The process validation studies include validation of the cell  culture  process,  anion  and  cation  exchange  chromatographic  steps,  virus  removal  filtration  in filters, concentration and diafiltration of the pre-formulated bulk, resin re-use studies for chromatographic  steps,  cleaning  processes  for  protein  A,  anion  and  cation  resins,  transport    and control of impurities and excipients.

## Characterisation

## A) Elucidation of Structure and Other Characteristics

The  drug  substance  has  been  comprehensively  characterised,  using  state-of-the-art  methods  for physico chemical characteristics.

## A1) Physicochemical characterisation.

The primary, secondary and tertiary structures of ustekinumab were analysed by various techniques.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The applicant generated a molecular model developed from a combination of crystal structures of the Fab and Fc using standard X-ray crystallographic methods.

The  complete  aminoacid  sequence  of  ustekinumab  was  verified  by  a  combination  of  aminoacid analysis  using  Edman  N-terminal  sequence  analysis,  PNGase  F  and  carboxypeptidase  B  treatment, peptide mapping and mass spectrometry.

The  secondary  and  tertiary  structures  were  analysed  by  far  and  near  UV  circular  dichroism spectroscopy respectively. Analytical ultracentrifugaction did not reveal any detectable tendency for self-association for ustekinumab.

Characterisation of glycosylation indicated that ustekinumab is N-glycosylated at a single site in each heavy  chain  Asn299.  The  N-linked  structures  consist  of  biantennal,  core-fucosylated  species  with galactose and sialic acid heterogeneity.

ustekinumab is a complex biomolecule that exists as a mixture of isoforms with variations in mass and  charge.  The  microheterogeneity  results  primarily  from  the  presence  of  multiple  N-glycan structures at Asn299 and from partial removal of heavy chain C-terminal lysine. IEF and cIEF profiles revealed 5 isoforms after carboxypeptidase B treatment.

## A2) Biological function

The methods used for assessing in vitro biological activity are based on the ability of ustekinumumab to  bind  directly  to  human  Il-12  neutralizing  its  biological  activity.  These  include  in-vitro  potency assay, binding (EIA) assay and Fc binding competition evaluation.

## B) Impurities

Protein based impurities are detected and monitored primarily by cSDS or SDS PAGE and DW-SEHPLC  or  SE-HPLC.  Impurities  detected  were  identified  when  sufficient  quantities  of  material allowed.

Host  cell  protein  impurities  present  requires  the  use  of  immunological  tests  such  as  the  HCP immunoassay.

## C) Degradants

Characterization  of  degradants  and  degradation  pathways  were  investigated  by  forced  degradation studies  performed  under  conditions  tailored  to  accelerate  specific  types  of  degradation,  a  batch  of ustekinumab  formulated  drug  product  incubated  at  40°C  in  the  final  vial  presentation  and  forced degradation and stressed stability studies.

## Specifications

The drug  substance  release  specifications,  including  tests  for  identity,  impurities,  potency,  quantity and general attributes, are acceptable and well justified.  Reference standards have been well described and qualified.

The  applicant  committed  to  review  the  specifications  once  additional  commercial  manufacturing batches have been undertaken.

##  Stability

The design of the stability program, including the testing intervals and storage temperature conditions are in accordance with current ICH guidelines. The tests chosen are a subset of tests from the release specifications selected for stability indicating properties.

## Medicinal Product

-  Pharmaceutical Development

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Formulation development studies were performed in order to determine the pH and buffer to minimize size related degradation products and deamidation and to achieve an optimal thermal stability profile.

Sucrose was chosen as stabilizer/tonicifier to facilitate subcutaneous administration after formulation. These excipients were used in early clinical studies and have been shown to be well tolerated.

Polysorbate  80  was  considered  important  to  protect  the  protein  from  unfolding  and  aggregate formation particularly due to physical agitation.

The  impact  of  metal  ion  spiking  studies  was  also  investigated  since  they  may  become  introduced during manufacture and could affect protein stability or aggregation. The data are adequately reported and did not show any effect.

Having established histidine, sucrose and PS80 as optimal buffer, tonicifier and surfactant respectively, experiments were designed to optimise their concentrations.

The composition of Stelara 90mg and 45mg final vialed product (FVP) includes Sucrose, L-histidine, Polisorbate 80 and Water for injection.

-  Adventitious Agents

The viral safety of Stelara with respect to adventitious agents is assured through the design and control of  the  manufacturing  process.  Potential  viral  agents  include  endogenous  retrovirus  and  adventitious agents.  Raw  material  controls  minimize  the  risk  of  contamination  by  adventitious  agents,  and clearance  studies  provide  assurance  that  any  potential  endogenous  or  adventitious  agents  will  be eliminated.

Viral clearance is achieved through chemical viral inactivation and physical removal of virus using chromatographic  and  filtration  processes.  These  steps  include  a  dedicated  viral  inactivation  step (solvent/detergent [S/D] inactivation) and a dedicated removal step (virus filtration), in addition to the viral clearance achieved through two orthogonal chromatographic unit operations.

Reduced scale models of the chromatography steps and the dedicated viral inactivation and removal steps  were  used  to  evaluate  clearance  of  ERV,  poliovirus  Type  1  (poliovirus),  pseudorabies  virus (PRV),  and  reovirus-3  (reovirus).  Initially,  the  S/D  inactivation  data  for  PRV  was  not  considered sufficiently reassuring. By request, the applicant provided additional data on studies performed. The new results showed a low efficacy towards the inactivation of this virus. The applicant explains these low  results  by  the  impact  of  temperature  used.  Despite  the  results  for  the  S/D  step,  it  should  be acknowledged that overall claimed PRV and ERV clearance across the Stelara manufacturing process is considered adequate.

With  respect  to  the  nanofiltration  step  only  poliovirus  clearance  was  determined  The  claimed clearance was considered unexpected for this kind of virus since it should be more efficiently removed by virus filter as it is dedicated to the elimination of small non-enveloped viruses.

Based on the lack of validation data for ERV clearance using the nanofilter, it was considered that viral validations should have been performed with a larger panel of viruses including retroviruses and parvoviruses. With this respect, the Applicant provided during the procedure additional data on virus filter  clearance of retroviruses using XuMLV as the test virus.  The results provide some assurance that a similar clearance of ERV could be achieved with the virus filter under the same conditions. In addition, to further assure that the virus filter is robust, the Applicant will undertake a post-approval study  using  a  parvovirus  model  virus  MMV.    Considering  the  validation  data  provided,  it  was concluded that the overall viral clearance of the manufacturing process for Stelara is sufficient.

The applicant provided virus clearance data for affinity chromatography and anion exchange resins at the  end  of  the  validated  resin  re-use.  Interim  results  confirm  that  adequate  virus  clearance  is maintained. The applicant commits to finalise the studies using two additional resin lots.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The routine manufacture of Stelara does not involve any human or ruminant animal-derived material. Therefore, no TSE safety issues arise from this.

##  Manufacture of the Product

The drug product is manufactured by Cilag AG, Schaffhausen, Switzerland, operated in accordance to current EU good manufacturing practices (GMP).

The drug product manufacturing process consists  of a  sterilization  filtration  and  aseptic  filling  into vials. The drug product is presented as a solution for injection containing 90 mg/ml  ustekinumab, Lhistidine, sucrose, polysorbate 80 and water for injection. The drug product is presented in two doses, a 45 mg vial (0.5 mL) and 90 mg vial (1.0 mL).

Critical process parameters were identified and documented as part of a risk assessment performed as outlined in ICH Q9.

Validation of the commercial process was performed on 3 batches.

The media fill and process validation results, lot-to-lot consistency data and critical process controls have shown that the sterile filtration and aseptic filling process are robust and well controlled and that the drug product can be consistently manufactured.

The manufacturing process is controlled by a series of critical process parameters (CPPs), in-process controls (IPCs), critical quality attributes (CQAs) and other product characteristics.  These parameters were  determined  following  clinical  manufacturing  experience  by  means  of  a  risk  assessment,  and parameters categorized and parameters set.

##  Product Specification

The final product release and shelf life specifications, including tests for identity, impurities, potency, quantity and general attributes were provided.

The applicant commits to review the final drug product specifications when data is available after 10 full scale commercial batches.

##  Stability of the Product

Real time and accelerated stability studies were initiated in accordance with ICH guidelines to monitor the time-temperature stability of phase 3 and validation batches.

Based on the data provided, the approvable shelf-life for the drug product is 12 months at 2-8 C.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

In general, the different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with existing guidelines.

Cell line development is well described and documented.  The resulting master and working cell banks have been extensively characterised, with respect to integration sites, copy number, sequencing and microbiological  and  viral  safety.    The  cell  bank  was  found  to  contain  retrovirus-like  particles  by transmission  electron  microscopy  (TEM),  that  have  been  shown  to  be  defective,  and  for  which  the purification processes have been shown to be effective in removing.  These retrovirus-like particles are expected in murine Sp2/0 cells.

Cell culture conditions and  in-process controls are sufficiently described and  are  considered appropriate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall  the  up-stream  manufacturing  and  purification  processes  and  controls  in  place  for  the  drug substance are well described.  The production processes of the drug substance and the capacity of the process  to  remove  DNA,  host  cell  protein,  residual  Protein  A  and  cell  culture  additives  have  been suitability validated.

Extensive product characterisation has been undertaken including primary sequence  analysis, oligosaccharide and sialic acid analysis, charge heterogeneity, size distribution and structural isoforms. The  Stelara  characterisation  undertaken  by  the  company  was  extensive,  as  was  the  work  done  on product and process related impurities.

The drug substance release specifications are acceptable and well justified and all methods adequately validated.    Reference  standards  have  been  well  described  and  qualified.    Current  stability  data  for Stelara drug product support the 12 months shelf life at 2-8°C.

The pharmaceutical development of the finished product and the manufacturing process of the finished product have been extensively described and is considered adequately controlled and validated. The drug product specifications have been justified.

The  overall  viral  clearance  of  the  manufacturing  process  for  Stelara  is  sufficient  based  on  the validation data provided on the S/D inactivation, nanofiltration and chromatographic steps.

It was noted that the applicant have not validated the nanofiltration step for the removal of ERV. The data  provided  on  poliovirus  model  and  the  data  provided  on  retrovirus  XuMLV  provide  some assurance  that  a  similar  clearance  of  ERV  could  be  achieved  with  the  nanofilter  under  the  same conditions. In addition, to further assure the nanofiltration step is robust the applicant will undertake a post-approval study using a parvovirus model virus MMV.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

## Pharmacology

-  Primary pharmacodynamics

The pharmacology of ustekinumab was characterised using investigations of target binding interactions, mechanism of action, functional effects of neutralisation, species cross-reactivity and in vivo activity supporting a psoriasis indication.

ustekinumab  is  a  fully  human  monoclonal  antibody  that  is  designed  to  neutralize  the  biological activities  of  the  human  interleukin  cytokines  IL-12  and  IL-23.  It  was  shown  to  have  comparable binding and neutralising activity against human and cynomolgus macaque IL-12 and IL-23.

##  Secondary pharmacodynamics

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies analysed in  vivo activity  of  ustekinumab  in  animal  models  of immune-mediated diseases other than psoriasis.

CNTO 1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab) was pharmacologically active in non-human primates in a marmoset experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model (EAE) and was effective in suppressing EAE  incidence  and  severity  in  marmosets.  CNTO  1275  (STELARA,  ustekinumab)  delayed  white matter demyelination and suppressed inflammation of pre-existing brain lesions in marmoset EAE.

IL-12 has been shown to antagonise immune responses mediated through Th2 T-cell lineages, which are thought to contribute to allergy and asthma immunopathologies. Thus, it was theoretically possible that  neutralising  IL-12  via  CNTO  1275  (STELARA,  ustekinumab)  could  exacerbate  Th2-mediated diseases  such  as  asthma.  As  a  result  two  studies  were  conducted  in  an  acute  asthma  model  in cynomolgus monkeys, which revealed that CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab) did not exacerbate

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the asthmatic response or cellular responses after aerosol antigen challenge. Thus, CNTO 1275-related exacerbation of Th2-mediated disease was not observed.

##  Safety pharmacology programme

No adverse effects of ustekinumab were observed in safety pharmacology evaluations following single and repeated dosing in cynomolgus monkeys via intravenous or subcutaneous routes of administration at doses up 45 mg/kg. No adverse effects of ustekinumab were noted in cardiovascular evaluations of juvenile F1 monkeys exposed to ustekinumab indirectly following treatment of their respective dams. Cardiovascular/respiratory  evaluations  following  single  and  repeated  dosing  with  CNTO  1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab)  at  doses  up  to  45  mg/kg  in  monkeys  showed  no  CNTO  1275-related findings.

There were no ECG findings in juvenile monkeys exposed to CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab) indirectly following administration of CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab) at doses up to 45 mg/kg during gestation and lactation.

No  CNTO  1275-related  effects  on  heart  rate  or  capillary  refill  times  were  observed,  nor  in histopathology evaluations of cardiac tissue. Taken together, the data generated in toxicity studies did not suggest a relationship between CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab) administration and changes in ECG intervals or identify cardiovascular safety issues. There were no findings in the CNS and no changes in body temperature. No CNTO 1275-related changes in behaviour were recorded.

Data from cardiovascular and respiratory endpoints in toxicity studies, post-mortem cardiac observations, in vitro binding data from pharmacology  studies and from the human  tissue cross-reactivity  study  confirmed  that  there  were  no  cardiovascular  safety  signals  in  the  toxicology program.

##  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

It  was  acknowledged  that,  because  of  the  high  binding  specificity  of  CNTO  1275  (STELARA, ustekinumab) for its target, IL-12/23p40, it is unlikely to have pharmacodynamic interactions with coadministered drugs. Thus, no non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted with CNTO 1275.

## Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of  ustekinumab were investigated mostly in the toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys  following  single  and  repeated  subcutaneous  administration  at  doses  between  0.9  and 45 mg/kg. Studies to support modifications in the material and formulation during the development programme  were  also  conducted.  Traditional  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  and  excretion (ADME) studies were not performed, which is consistent with ICH Topic S6 guidance for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).

ustekinumab was absorbed into the systemic circulation with a mean Tmax ranging from 2 to 7 days. Mean  Cmax  and  AUC  values  increased  in  an  approximately  dose-proportional  manner.  Mean  t 1/2 ranged from approximately 2 to 3 weeks. Following twice-weekly SC dosing, an estimated 5- to 10fold  accumulation in AUC and Cmax was noted. Steady-state was reached by Week 13. The mean steady-state Cmax value following a 45 mg/kg twice-weekly SC dose in monkeys (2347.08 µg/mL) was approximately 116-fold higher than the median Cmax value following 4 weekly 90 mg SC doses in  subjects  with  psoriasis  (20.3  µg/mL).  The  absolute  bioavailability  was  estimated  to  be  97%  by cross-study comparison of a single-dose intravenous study and a single-dose subcutaneous study.  The volume of distribution of ustekinumab in monkeys was 86 to 98 mL/kg following a single IV dose of 4.5 mg/kg, suggesting that the distribution of ustekinumab was mainly confined to the intravascular space, consistent with the volume of distribution for typical therapeutic IgG-based mAbs. ustekinumab was shown to cross the placenta into developing embryos. Fetal exposure to ustekinumab was proportional to the increase in SC dose administered to the dams.

Anti- ustekinumab antibodies were detected in single- but not in multiple-dose studies, which might have been related to the substantial presence of circulating ustekinumab during the observation period

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

or possible immune tolerance induction. Development of anti- ustekinumab antibodies was found to be associated with accelerated clearance and shortened half-life of ustekinumab in monkeys.

Acceptable pharmacokinetic and immunogenic comparability were shown between batches of material produced by two different cell lines and between liquid and lyophilised formulations.

## Toxicology

The safety studies include repeated-dose toxicity with periods of recovery in cynomolgus monkeys, and developmental and reproductive toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys and mice; a number of non-pivotal studies was also conducted. The choice of the cynomolgus monkey was justified on the basis  of  a  tissue  cross-reactivity  study;  there  was  also  no  evidence  of  binding  to  human  tissues, indicating a low potential for off-target effects.

ustekinumab was generally well tolerated following IV doses up to 45 mg/kg/week for up to 1 month and  following  twice-weekly  SC  doses  up  to  45  mg/kg  for  6  months.  No  target  organ  toxicity  or delayed  toxicity  was  found.  In  the  last  week  of  the  26-week  chronic  toxicity  study,  one  animal developed bacterial enteritis and a possible contribution of ustekinumab to this infection could not be excluded. The mean steady-state Cmax value following a 45 mg/kg twice-weekly SC dose in monkeys was approximately 116-fold higher than the median Cmax value following 4 weekly 90 mg SC doses in subjects with psoriasis.

##  Single dose toxicity

No  single-dose  toxicity  studies  were  conducted.    No  evidence  of  acute  toxicity  was  observed  in single-dose PK studies.

##  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  showed  that  CNTO  1275  (STELARA,  ustekinumab)  is  generally  well tolerated following IV doses up to 45 mg/kg/week for up to 1 month (Studies T-099-003 and T-099004),  and  following  twice-weekly  SC  doses  up  to  45  mg/kg  for  6  months  (Study  T-2001-004).  No CNTO 1275-related deaths or moribundity were observed. In the last week of the 26-week chronic toxicity  study,  one  animal  developed  bacterial  enteritis  and  a  possible  contribution  of  CNTO  1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab)  to  this  infection  could  not  be  excluded.  For  all  studies,  there  were  no CNTO  1275-related  physical  signs,  adverse  effects  on  body  weight,  food  consumption,  body temperature or chemical pathology indices observed following CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab)  administration.  There  were  no  CNTO  1275-related  findings  in  ophthalmoscopic  and physical examinations.

Post-mortem examinations revealed no tumours or histopathological evidence of CNTO 1275-related pre-neoplastic changes in any organs or tissues.

## -  26-week  Subcutaneous  Dose  Toxicity  and  Toxicokinetic  Study  with  CNTO  1275  (STELARA, ustekinumab)    in Cynomolgus Monkeys with a 12-week Recovery Period (Study T-2001-004)

CNTO 1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab) was dosed SC twice weekly to 3 dose groups of cynomolgus monkeys of 8/sex/group at doses of 22.5 or 45 mg/kg for 13 or 26 weeks. Control monkeys received SC injections of 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, in a dose volume of 0.5 mL/kg. The CNTO 1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab)    treatment  groups  received  SC  injections  of  a  90  mg/mL  solution  of CNTO 1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab) in dose volumes of 0.25 and 0.5 mL/kg, in the 22.5 and 45 mg/kg groups, respectively.

Three animals/sex/group were sacrificed following 13 and 26 weeks of dosing and 2/animals/sex/group  were  sacrificed  after  a  12-week  treatment  free  period  following  26  weeks  of dosing  to  evaluate  reversibility,  persistence,  and/or  delayed  occurrence  of  any  potential  adverse effects.    Safety  pharmacology  end-points  were  incorporated  into  the  study  design.    Immunotoxicity measurements were incorporated into the study.  Necropsy examinations were performed in weeks 14, 27 and 38.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No deaths or CNTO 1275-related physical signs of  toxicity  were  observed  and  no  effects  on  body weight or food consumption were noted.

One  monkey  in  the  45  mg/kg  group  manifested  physical  signs  associated  with  bacterial  enteritis including  low  food  consumption  on  Day  169  and  non-formed  faeces  on  Days  173  and  176.  This monkey's body weight declined approximately 13% over 2-weeks going from 3.9 kg on Day 162 to 3.7 kg and 3.4 kg, respectively on Days 169 and 176. The Week 26 neutrophil count in this animal was  increased  3.4-fold  relative  to  its  average  untreated  baseline  value  and  was  associated  with  an increase in percentage of neutrophils from approximately 43% to 85%, from average baseline to Week 26  values,  respectively.  Post-mortem  findings  confirmed  the  diagnosis  of  bacterial  enteritis.  In  the ileum, bacteria were observed in the mucosa and moderate to severe acute inflammation with minimal congestion/haemorrhage  were  observed  with  minimal  inflammation  noted  in  the  colon  and  rectum. The  observation  of  bacteria  within  the  mucosa  is  consistent  with  bacterial  overgrowth  and  the diagnosis  of  bacterial  enteritis  was  based  on  the  observed  inflammation  of  the  small  intestine  and bacterial cultures. The collected mesenteric lymph node was observed to be large and microscopically, slight  lymphoplasmacytic  hyperplasia  was  noted.  Consistent  with  bacterial  infection  and  increased neutrophils,  hyperplasia  of  the  myeloid  cells  was  noted  in  the  bone  marrow.  Spontaneous  repeated bouts of diarrhoea are often observed in control and stock cynomolgus monkeys. In this study, nonformed faeces were observed in all dose groups including controls.

In  chemical  pathology  evaluations,  small  statistically  significant  differences  between  controls  and CNTO 1275-treated  groups  were  noted.  These  were  considered  incidental  and  of  no  toxicological significance  because  the  magnitude  of  these  changes  was  small;  similar  differences  were  noted  in pre-dose values and/or there were no histopathological correlates.

Post-mortem, there were no CNTO 1275-related macroscopic or microscopic observations or organ weight changes.

There was no evidence of delayed toxicity in the animals sacrificed after 12 weeks of recovery.

## - A Multiple Intravenous Dose Toxicity Study with 12B75 in Cynomolgus Monkeys (Study no. T-099004)

CNTO 1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab)        was  administered  by  intravenous  infusion  to  3  dosage groups  of  10  monkeys  per  group  (5/sex/group)  at  dosages  of  0  (0.9%  saline),  9  or  45  mg/kg  once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. The IV infusions were administered in a dose volume of 5 mL/kg at a rate of approximately 3 mL/minute.

Safety  pharmacology  end-points  were  incorporated  into  the  study  design.    In  addition  to  standard measurements, lymphocyte subset (CD2, CD20, CD14, CD4 and CD8) were characterised in samples collected  on  Day  28  from  all  animals  and  on  Days  58  and  59  from  recovery  females  and  males, respectively. Lymphoproliferative responses to concanavalin A (Con A) and phytohaemagglutinin A (PHA) were evaluated pre-dose, and on Days 28, 45 and 59/60.  The animals were sacrificed one week after the fourth dose (3/sex/group) and after a 5-week post-dose recovery period (2/sex/group).

No  deaths  or  CNTO  1275-related  physical  signs  of  toxicity  were  observed.  Body  weight,  body temperature, food consumption and ophthalmic findings were not affected  by  CNTO  1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab) treatment.  In females dosed at 45 mg/kg, slight but significant reductions in mean relative lymphocyte values and increases in mean relative neutrophil values were observed on Day 28 and corresponded to significant changes in absolute lymphocyte and neutrophil counts.

To understand better the toxicological significance of these observations, lymphocyte and neutrophil differential  values  in  the  female  monkeys  given  45  mg/kg  on  the  Day  28  were  compared  with  the pre-dose values. Only one female monkey (No. 3102) showed a marked decrease in the percentage of lymphocytes  and  increases  in  neutrophil  percentages  in  the  Day  28  differentials.    The  differentials were relatively unchanged from pre-dose values for the other females. No increases in immature cells of neutrophil lineage (band neutrophils, myelocytes or metamyelocytes) were observed in any animal of this group. No corresponding changes were observed in the male monkeys dosed at 45 mg/kg at any

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

time during the study. Lymphocyte and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) values in the 45 mg/kg females  at  Day  9  (2  days  after  the  second  dose)  and  in  the  2  recovery  animals  on  Day  58  were comparable to pre-dose values. No changes were noted in the 45 mg/kg females in lymphocyte subset analyses, lymphoproliferative responses to the T-cell mitogens, lymphoid organ weights or histopathology.  The  peripheral  blood  differential  changes  observed  in  female  monkeys  dosed  at  45 mg/kg were considered likely to be related to stress-induced margination of the circulating leukocytes. Based on consideration of observations during a blinded peer review of lymphoid tissues; the absence of corresponding changes in male monkeys; absence of corresponding differences between control and high-dose  females  with  respect  to  numbers  of  immature  granulocytes,  specific  lymphocyte  subsets, lymphoid  organ  weights,  histopathology  or  lymphoproliferative  responses,  the  observed  changes  in lymphocyte and neutrophil differential values are not considered of toxicological significance.

No  CNTO 1275-related  changes  in  organ  weights  were  noted.  There  were  no  CNTO  1275-related macroscopic or microscopic findings at the end of dosing necropsy (1 week after administration of the fourth dose) or recovery necropsy (5 weeks after administration of the fourth dose).

It was noted from the report of the 6-month toxicity study that antibodies to CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab)    were detected in 15 out of 16 monkeys in the saline treatment group. Antibodies to CNTO 1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab)    were initially of low titre, but increased until Week 30, after  which titres declined. The immune responses were shown to bind specifically to CNTO 1275, and  not  to  other  similar  immunoglobulin  proteins.  Toxicokinetic  data  (Centocor  Technical  Report CP2002T-091) did not reveal exposure to CNTO 1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab)    in the saline treatment group; however there were no blood samples available for toxicokinetic analyses between Days  17  and  71.  The  applicant  reported  that  review  of  the  dosing  procedures  did  not  indicate  any procedural  deficiencies  that  could  have  resulted  in  accidental  exposure  to  CNTO  1275.  Therefore, there  is  no  explanation  for  the  immune  antibody  response  results  observed  in  the  saline-treated monkeys.

As regards the 1-month study, the section of the peer review report covering the altered differential count is copied below:

'The most dramatic change of neutrophil increase and lymphocyte decrease in the high dose female  monkeys  was  noted  in  monkey  No.  3102.  The  differential  count  did  not  reveal immature forms of neutrophils (metamyelocytes, myelocytes) consistent with a leukocytosis that was not related to increased hematopoiesis. These data could have been obtained from a stressed animal wherein marginated leukocytes in vessels were released into the circulation. In  order  to  support  the  peripheral  blood  differential  cell  count  obtained  with  the  clinical pathology  data,  a  large  vein  in  the  pancreas  (slide  No.  12)  was  found  that  contained approximately 75 white blood cells mixed with erythrocytes that represented trapped blood (the  pancreas  was  included  on  the  slide  containing  the  spleen  and  thymus).  Other  vessels containing  blood  were  not  available  in  the  tissue  sections  for  examination.  Approximately 60% of the leukocytes were granulocytes and 40% were lymphocytes and monocytes rather than  the  91%  granulocytes  and  7%  lymphocytes  observed  in  the  data  obtained  from  the peripheral  blood.  Application  of  the  estimated  numbers  to  the  total  leukocyte  count  would have eliminated the neutrophilia and lymphopenia reported for monkey No. 31 02.'

It  was  not  clear  whether  this  was  unrelated  to  treatment  or  whether  the  animal  in  question  was particularly  sensitive  to  the  effects  of  CNTO  1275  (STELARA,  ustekinumab)  and  could  be  an indicator of an effect that might happen in more individuals were a larger population to be studied.

Toxicokinetic  analysis  of  the  26-week  SC  repeat-dose  study  confirmed  significant  exposure  of  the monkeys  to  sustained  high  serum  concentrations  of  CNTO  1275.  Pharmacokinetic  and  immune response analyses indicated that CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab) exposure was not limited by development of immune antibody responses to CNTO 1275.

The exposure levels  following  subcutaneous  dosing  are  summarised  in  the  applicant's  table  copied from the pharmacokinetics tabular summary below:

No Serum CNTO 1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab) (&lt; 0.19 μ g/ml) was found in control samples.

Systemic exposure to CNTO 1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab) increased with dose; a 2-fold increase in  dose  resulted  in  an  approximately  1.7-fold  increase  in  Cmax  and  AUC.    The  mean  trough concentrations  on  Day  166  for  25  and  50 mg/kg  were  1335.58  and  1794.02 μ g/ml  respectively. Accumulation ratios for AUC (0-72h) were approximately 10.70 and 5.70 after twice weekly dosing of the 22.5 and 45 mg/kg CNTO 1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab)    for 26 weeks, respectively.  The mean value of peak to trough ratio at steady state was 1.43.

Toxicokinetic analysis of the 1-month IV repeat-dose study revealed that CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab)  accumulated  in  the  sera  with  repeated  weekly  dosing  at  9  or  45  mg/kg.  The  mean maximum  serum  concentrations  observed  in  the  9  and  45  mg/kg  groups  were  approximately  540 μ g/mL and 3600 μ g/mL, respectively in samples obtained 2 h following the last dose. Because of the high concentrations of CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab) in serum samples, immune response analyses  were  not  performed  because  high  serum  concentrations  of  CNTO  1275  (STELARA, ustekinumab)  interfere  with  detection  of  monkey  anti-CNTO  1275  (STELARA,  ustekinumab) antibodies.

The  maximum  mean  serum  concentrations  are  presented  in  the  applicant's  table  copied  from  the pharmacokinetics tabular summary below:

N/A-Not Applicable

It was accepted that adequate exposure of the animals in the toxicity studies has been demonstrated.

##  Genotoxicity

Genotoxicity tests were not conducted.

##  Carcinogenicity

In  accordance  with  the  guideline  entitled  'Preclinical  Safety  Evaluation  of  Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals'  (ICH  S6), c arcinogenicity studies were  not  performed.  Direct  evaluation  of carcinogenic potential of CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab) in carcinogenicity studies or rodent tumour  immune  surveillance  models  is  precluded  by  the  limited  species  reactivity  of  CNTO  1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab)    which does not bind to or neutralise IL-12 or IL-23 from mice or rats. Thus,  the  potential  for  CNTO  1275  (STELARA,  ustekinumab)  to  increase  the  risk  of  tumour development in humans cannot be evaluated directly in standard rodent carcinogenicity studies. Monitoring  of  malignancy  will  be  a  part  of  the  comprehensive  Risk  Management  Plan  for  CNTO 1275.

##  Reproduction Toxicity

ustekinumab had no effects on male fertility as assessed by spermatogenic measurements only. The NOEL of ustekinumab for effects on male fertility was 45 mg/kg. There were no effects on mating behaviour  or  inhibin  and  testosterone  serum  concentrations,  nor  on  sperm  number,  morphology, viability or motility.

Female fertility was investigated in a supportive study in mice using a rat-mouse chimaeric anti-mouse IL-12/23p40 monoclonal Antibody, CNTO 3913. The choice of this model was justified on the basis of the less robust reproductive characteristics of the monkey; it is accepted that the outcome is limited to  the  identification  of  potential  female  fertility  hazards  through  blocking  IL12/23  and  not  as  a definitive estimate of risk for  ustekinumab.  There were no adverse effects of CNTO 3913 on female fertility indices and CNTO 3913 was well tolerated by female mice at doses up to 50 mg/kg.

In studies of embryo-fetal development in cynomolgus monkeys dosed intravenously or subcutaneously and pre-and post-natal development dosed subcutaneously, there were no effects on gestation, parturition, lactation or morphology or development of the offspring. The NOAEL was 45 mg/kg once weekly by the intravenous route and twice weekly by the subcutaneous route.

##  Toxicokinetic data

Toxicokinetic  analysis  confirmed  significant  exposure  of  the  monkeys  to  sustained  high  serum concentrations  of  ustekinumab.  Pharmacokinetic  and  immune  response  analyses  indicated  that ustekinumab exposure was not limited by development of immune antibody responses to ustekinumab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Local tolerance

There was no evidence of local irritation by either the subcutaneous or intravenous routes.

-  Other toxicity studies

Immunotoxicity  evaluations  revealed  no  adverse  effects  of  ustekinumab  on  functional  immune responses,  circulating  lymphocyte  subpopulations  or  distribution  of  T-  and  B-lymphocytes  in lymphoid tissue.

There are no toxicological issues arising from the impurities.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

ustekinumab  is  not  considered  to  pose  any  adverse  environmental  effects.  Since  the  product  is  a protein, it is exempted from an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) under EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

The  Applicant  conducted  an  acceptable  programme  of  toxicity  studies.    Only  two  dose  levels  of ustekinumab  were  studied  and  mostly  only  one  species  for  the  toxicology,  but  this  was  considered acceptable for this type of product.  The duration of the repeat-dose studies was considered adequate to support a marketing authorisation.

ustekinumab was generally well tolerated under a regimen of twice weekly subcutaneous dosing at 45 mg/kg  for  6  months  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  and  adequate  margins  of  exposure  over  the  human clinical  exposure  were  demonstrated.    No  target  organs  were  identified  and  there  was  no  delayed toxicity after dosing had stopped.  The possibility of immune suppression could not be ruled out in the case of one animal in the 6-month study that developed bacterial enteritis.

It is noted that, in the 6-month repeat-dose study and the embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, antibodies  to  ustekinumab  were  found  in  control  samples.    There  is  no  clear  explanation  for  this finding but it was accepted that it is possible to draw valid conclusions from these studies.  It was also accepted that it is indeed unlikely that an explanation can be provided for this finding.

A general finding in the toxicity studies was that it was not possible to discern whether there had been an  anti-antibody  response  to  ustekinumab,  although  some  animals  were  noted  to  have  greater clearance than others. This was not considered to have invalidated the studies and the pharmacokinetic indices were considered to show that adequate exposure was demonstrated.

ustekinumab had no effects on male fertility as assessed by spermatogenic measurements only.  In females there were no effects on gestation, parturition, lactation or morphology and development of the offspring.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The  clinical  development  program  of  STELARA  (  ustekinumab)  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to severe plaque psoriasis consisted of 5 studies with different formulations examining IV administration at a single dose and SC administration at single and multiple doses (both fixed and weight adjusted). The 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies C0743T08 [PHOENIX 1] and C0743T09 [PHOENIX 2]) in which 1965 subjects were exposed to ustekinumab, included the formulation and dosing regimens intended for the commercial product. An overview of the studies used to derive population PK data is given below.

*Intensive sampling schemes enable determination of the ful1 PK profile using a non-model-based approach (eg, non-compartmental analysis).Sparse sampling schemes require a model-based approach to characterize the full PK profile.

Subjects randomized to placebo who crossed-over to CNTO1275 were included.

For C0379T07, C0743T08 and C0743T09, this includes all subjects who received at least 1 administration of

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

Validated  methods  of  enzyme-linked  immunosorbant  assay  (ELISA)  and  electrochemiluminescent immunoassay  (ECLIA)  were  used  to  determine  the  serum  CNTO  1275  (STELARA,  ustekinumab) concentrations  in  the  clinical  studies.  An  enzyme  immunoassay  (EIA)  method  was  developed  and validated to detect antibodies to ustekinumab in human serum samples. Human serum samples from clinical studies identified as containing antibodies to ustekinumab were further characterized for the ability of those antibodies to neutralize the bioactivity of ustekinumab using a cell-based assay.

##  Absorption/ Bioavailability

From the phase 1 trial C0379T02, which used SC dosing, based on the dose-normalized AUC from the IV study C0379T01, the bioavailability (F) of  ustekinumab was estimated to be 57.2% (range: 24.3% to 95.0%) following a single SC administration (0.27 mg/kg to 2.7 mg/kg).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Distribution

The final population PK model was developed using the combined data from both phase 3 trials. The final model was found to be robust after validation by bootstrap method and visual predictive check approach.  In  the  final  model  with  combined  data  set,  the  population  CL/F  and  V/F  values  were estimated to be 0.465 L/d and 15.7 L, respectively. The median half-life of ustekinumab was estimated to be 21.6 days. There was no evidence of accumulation of ustekinumab within the dose ranges and frequency used in the phase 3 trials. The modelling used to derive population PK data correlated with the results from individual studies.

On population PK modelling the factors found to be statistically significant (p &lt; 0.005) in increasing the CL/F of ustekinumab were increased weight (&gt;100kg), diabetes and positive immune response to ustekinumab.

-  Elimination

The  median  CL  values  following  a  single  intravenous  injection  ranged  from  1.8  mL/day/kg  to  2.3 mL/day/kg  in  subjects  with  psoriasis  (C0379T01).    The  median  CL/F  following  a  single  SC administration was 3.0 mL/day/kg given an absolute bioavailability (F) of 57.2%, this is consistent with the CL value reported in the IV study C0379T01.  The CL/F values were somewhat higher in subjects with psoriasis.

-  Dose proportionality and time dependencies

The mean serum concentrations of ustekinumab generally peaked at weeks 1 to 2 following a single SC administration and then declined exponentially through weeks 12 to 24. For subjects who received 4  weekly  SC  administrations,  the  median  t 1/2 was  approximately  21  days  to  29  days,  which  is comparable to the t 1/2 after a single SC administration in the same study (approximately 20 days to 21 days). These results demonstrated that the t1/2 remains constant after multiple dose regimens. In the 2 Phase 3 studies in subjects with psoriasis (PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2), serum concentrations were comparable through Week 28 at each of the 2 dose levels (45 mg and 90 mg). Overall, there was no evidence of accumulation at the doses used.

-  Special populations

Weight: Pharmacokinetic  modelling  in  psoriasis  subjects  above  and  below  100kg  revealed  lower serum  levels  and  AUC  of  ustekinumab  (about  30%  lower)  in  subjects  &gt;100kg.  This  difference between subjects based on weight also correlates with lower clinical efficacy.

The PK model also predicted mean CL/F and V/F values of ustekinumab increased with the increase of body weight. (CL/F and V/F values were 0.44 L/d and 14.2 L, respectively, in subjects ≤ 100 kg, and were 0.68 L/d and 19.5 L, respectively, in subjects &gt; 100 kg).

Elderly: The majority of subjects in the population PK analysis were non-elderly subjects (&lt;65 yrs of age):  106  elderly  (5.5%)  subjects  versus  a  total  of  1831  non-elderly  (94.5%)  were  included  in  the analysis  and  therefore  it  was  difficult  to  exclude  an  age  effect.    However  the  posology  and administration are the same (see section 4.2 of the SPC).

Children :  ustekinumab  was  not  tested  in  subjects  under  18years  of  age.  As  a  result,  Stelara  is  not recommended for use in children below age 18 (Section 4.2 of the SPC).

Other factors were evaluated for their possible effect on CL/F and/or V/F of ustekinumab:

- Impaired renal function: As creatinine clearance increased with weight and was higher in males, the relevance of the combined data was uncertain and the absolute effect was small;

- Impaired liver function: As the differences noted are small, the relevance was uncertain;

- Gender: A small difference was detected, which was considered unlikely to be significant;

-  Race: 1793 (92.6%) Caucasian subjects and 144 (7.4%) non-Caucasian subjects were included in the  population  PK  analysis.    Race  did  not  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  model-predicted  CL/F estimate of  ustekinumab.  Although the non-Caucasians subjects had an 11.1% lower V/F estimate than Caucasians this was not considered to be clinically meaningful.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

A total of the 28 most frequently used concomitant medications were evaluated for potential drug-drug interactions.    None  of  the  concomitant  medications  had  a  significant  effect  on  the  CL/F  of ustekinumab.

## Pharmacodynamics

##  Mechanism of action

IL-12 and IL-23 are heterodimeric cytokines secreted by activated antigen presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. IL-12 and IL-23 participate in immune function by contributing to NK cell activation and CD4+ T cell differentiation and activation. However, abnormal regulation of IL-12 and IL-23 has been associated with immune-mediated diseases, such as psoriasis.  ustekinumab is a fully human IgG1 қ monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and specificity to the p40 protein subunit of the human cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 and shows no cross-reactivity to structurally related proteins  IL-6,  IL-6sR,  CNTFR  (Ciliary  neurotrophic  factor), and  IL-11R. ustekinumab inhibits the bioactivity of human IL-12 and IL-23 by preventing these cytokines from binding to their IL-12R β 1 receptor protein expressed on the surface of Natural killer (NK) and CD4+ T  cells.    ustekinumab  cannot  bind  to  IL-12  or  IL-23  that  is  pre-bound  to  IL-12R β 1  cell  surface receptors.  Thus,  ustekinumab  is  not  likely  to  contribute  to  complement  or  antibody  mediated cytotoxicity  of  the  receptor-bearing  cell.    ustekinumab  prevents  IL-12  and  IL-23  contributions  to immune cell activation, such as intracellular signaling and cytokine secretion and is therefore believed to interrupt signaling and cytokine cascades that are central to psoriasis pathology.

##  Primary pharmacology

Study DIS.RES.DRR.005 was conducted to identify the IL-12 subunit specificity, epitope affinity, and stoichiometry  of  ustekinumab  binding  using  ELISA  and  nitrocellulose  membrane  binding  analysis. ustekinumab was found to be specific for the p40 subunit of Il-12 and did not bind to the structurally related  proteins  IL-6,  IL-6sR  CNTFR,  and  IL-11R.  Crystal  structure  and  mutational  analysis elucidated the molecular binding interactions as discontinuous residues located in the D1 domain of IL-12/23p40.  BIAcore  analysis  showed  that  ustekinumab  binds  human  IL-12  and  IL-23  with  the expected mAb/ligand 2:1 stoichiometry and with high affinity to IL-12 and IL- 23.

Study DIS.RES.DRR.006 examined the relationship between ustekinumab binding and natural ligand binding to the IL-12 and IL-23 receptors.  ustekinumab was shown to prevent IL-12 or IL-23 binding to  the  IL-12R β 1  receptor  chain  of  IL-12  and  IL-23  receptor  complexes.    ustekinumab  inhibited binding of IL-12 or IL-23 to IL-12R β 1 expressed on the cell surface either alone or in functional IL12R β 1/ β 2 and IL-12R β 1/23R dual receptor complexes.  ustekinumab did not bind to IL-12 or IL-23 that is pre-bound to cell surface receptors or stimulate complement dependent cytotoxicity responses.

Other than these studies and the demonstration of their clinical consequences in terms of benefit in plaque psoriasis there was no exploration of the primary pharmacology of ustekinumab. Although the mechanism of action is known, the PD measurements did not show any significant difference after treatment.

##  Secondary pharmacology

As  with  the  primary  pharmacology  there  was  sparse  exploration  on  the  secondary  pharmacology. There was limited evidence that ustekinumab does not bind to receptors other than IL-12 and IL-23, or that there is take-up by human tissues ex-vivo .

##  Relationship between plasma concentration and effect

Although multiple cytokines were measured to detect PD effects, there were no marked differences noted post-treatment.  This suggests that either the timing was too early or that ustekinumab exerts its effects without impairing the systemic immune system sufficiently to be detected with these assays. Further  studies  on  the  effect  of  Stelara  on  vaccination  responses  will  be  conducted  as  Follow-Up Measure.

Although the PD data (IL-12 related gene, serum cytokines IFN γ , IL-2, TNF α and lymphocyte surface markers) did not show any major changes when tested, the clinical response did show a correlation with  increasing  dose.  The  PASI  index  was  used  for  assessing  and  grading  the  severity  of  psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. The PASI produces a numeric score from 0 to 72, where higher

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

scores  represent  more  severe  disease,  and  is  calculated  taking  into  account  the  area  of  the  body involved, and the degree of erythema, induration and scaling of each lesion. Subjects who achieved ≥ 75% improvement from baseline are PASI 75 responders, those who achieved a 90% improvement are PASI 90 responders. When the PASI responses of subjects were plotted against their trough serum ustekinumab concentrations, a positive correlation was demonstrated.

Figure 1 Percent of subjects achieving PASI 75 and PASI 90 responses at Week 28 by trough serum    ustekinumab  concentrations  at  Week  28  in  psoriasis  Phase  3;  treated  subjects randomized to  ustekinumab at Week 0

<!-- image -->

There was evidence that ustekinumab level correlates with the clinical response and that there is no accumulation  with  the  dose  range  tested.  In  addition,  the  PK  data  demonstrated  that  patients  over 100kg  have  lower  serum  trough  levels  compared  with  those  under  100kg.  The  modelling  used  to derive population PK data correlated with the results from individual studies.

## Clinical efficacy

The application consists of two placebo-controlled pivotal trials (PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2) as well as a supportive earlier phase trial (please see table below).

The  recruitment  of  subjects  was  not  limited  to  those  indicated  in  the  SPC  (i.e.  adult  patients  with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant  to  other  systemic  therapies  including  ciclosporin,  methotrexate  and  PUVA).  However  the randomisation of patients in both phase 3 trials included randomisation on the basis of weight and on the  basis  of  whether  there  were  &lt;  3  or ≥ 3  conventional  therapies  to  which  the  subject  had  an inadequate  response,  intolerance,  or  contraindication.    This  group  constituted  11%  and  16%  of  the total population in PHOENIX 1 and 2 respectively.

The efficacy  of    ustekinumab  in  the  treatment  of  plaque  psoriasis  in  adult  patients  is  supported  by analyses from 5 studies. Table 1 details the posology for each trial.

## Dose-response studies

The  range  of  doses  of  ustekinumab  chosen  for  the  first  in  human  Phase  1  study  in  subjects  with psoriasis  was  predicted  to  span  subtherapeutic  and  therapeutic  serum  concentrations  based  on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

preclinical  data  from  nonhuman  primate  studies  and  in  vitro  neutralization  analyses,  and  was supported by IV toxicology studies in primates that demonstrated no observed adverse effect level at doses 500-fold higher than the first dose tier studied in humans and 10-fold higher than the highest dose studied.

The results for trial C0379T01 (single IV dose) are shown below (Figure 2).

Clinical efficacy of ustekinumab was evaluated by performing the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Physician's Global Assessment (PGA), and PSS (Psoriasis Severity Scale) measurements at multiple  time-points.    Examination  of  the  PASI  scores  showed  a  clear  tendency  towards  a  doseresponse, with no evidence of a response plateau over the tested dose range. Treatment responses as demonstrated  by  PASI  score  were  generally  first  evident  by  2  to  4  weeks  after  dosing.  In  general, maximum response to treatment was generally observed by week 12 and largely maintained at week 16. Because worsening of PASI scores at the end of follow-up was generally not evident, the duration of a single-dose IV treatment effect cannot be clearly estimated from this study.

Figure 2: Median percent improvements in overall PASI scores over time by treatment group.

<!-- image -->

Overall, a single IV infusion of ustekinumab produced clinically significant improvement in PASI and PGA, (physician global assessment grades lesions with regard to induration, scaling and erythema). The PGA is defined as (0) = cleared, (1) = minimal, (2) = mild, (3) = moderate, (4) = marked and (5) = severe) in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis, and this improvement was generally sustained over the 16-week study period.

There was evidence for efficacy of ustekinumab from PASI and PGA scores compared with placebo. In addition there was evidence of efficacy in the DLQI score, a dermatology-specific QOL instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a subject's QOL, compared with placebo. It is a 10item  questionnaire  that  is  used  to  assess  6  different  aspects  that  may  affect  QOL:  symptoms  and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment. The DLQI score is calculated by summing the score of each question, with an overall score ranging from 0 to 30; a lower DLQI score represents better QOL).  The effect is delayed taking &gt;6 weeks to achieve maximal effect, is weight and dose dependent, long-lasting  (up to 12 weeks) and re-treatment is effective in those who did not respond initially.

PGA scores also showed a clinically meaningful improvement in the majority of subjects by weeks 8 to  12,  with  better  therapeutic  response  observed  in  the  2  highest  dose  groups  (0.9  and  4.5  mg/kg), suggesting a correlation of clinical response with dose of ustekinumab.

Results from trial C0379T02 revealed improvement in PASI and PGA in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis after a single SC administration of ustekinumab. The maximum effect of treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was observed between weeks 8 and 16 in all treatment groups. Clinically significant improvement was sustained in the 3.0 mg/kg treatment group throughout the 24-week study. Furthermore, the efficacy data generally suggested a positive correlation of extent and duration of clinical response with dose of ustekinumab.

The  primary  endpoint  of  study  C0379T04 was  the  proportion  of  PASI  75  responders  at  Week  12. More subjects in the ustekinumab groups had PGA scores of clear or excellent than subjects in the placebo  group  through  Week  20.  After  placebo  crossover,  a  majority  (52.7%)  of  subjects  in  the placebo → 90 mg group scored clear or excellent on the PGA at Week 32.

At Week 12, subjects in each of the 4 ustekinumab groups had statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements (decreases) in DLQI Dermatology Life Quality Index scores (p &lt; 0.001 for each CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab) group compared with placebo).

## Main clinical studies

The two Phase 3 studies (PHOENIX 1 [C0743T08] and PHOENIX 2 [C0743T09]) were designed to evaluate  how  the  product  should  be  used  in  the  long-term  management  of  psoriasis.  These  studies evaluated dosing regimens proposed for marketing and therefore provide the most relevant information.

## METHODS

## Study Participants

Study  PHOENIX  1:  This  was  a  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of  ustekinumab in the treatment of subjects with moderate to severe plaque  psoriasis,  and  evaluating  whether  subjects  who  inadequately  respond  to  an  initial  dosing regimen at q12w intervals would respond to more frequent drug administration at q8w intervals.

Inclusion Criteria: Men and women 18 years of age or older were eligible to participate if they had a diagnosis of plaque-type psoriasis for 6 or more months, covering ≥ 10% of total body surface area (BSA),  screening  and  baseline  PASI  score ≥ 12,  and  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Subjects were to have had no history of active or latent TB on TB screening.

Exclusion Criteria: The study excluded subjects with non-plaque psoriasis or drug-induced psoriasis. Previous  users  of  ustekinumab  or  subjects  who  had  had  a  serious  reaction  to  mAbs  were  excluded from  participation.  Subjects  who  were  pregnant,  nursing,  or  planning  pregnancy  (both  men  and women) while enrolled in the study were to be excluded. The study excluded subjects with current signs  or  symptoms  of  severe,  progressive,  or  uncontrolled  medical  conditions.  Have  ever  received natalizumab or other agents that target alpha-4-integrin. Have received within 3 months prior to the first injection a live virus or bacterial vaccination. Subjects must agree not to receive a live virus or bacterial (including BCG) vaccination during the study or up to 12 months after the last study agent injection.    Those  with  a  history  of  severe  anaphylaxis,  asthma,  severe  infection,  malignancy  or transplantation were excluded.

To examine whether longer-term treatment with CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab) would result in durable remissions, the duration of response and the need for maintenance therapy were evaluated using a randomized withdrawal design in which long-term PASI 75 responders (ie, achieved a PASI 75 response at Weeks 28 and 40) were randomized at Week 40 to maintenance therapy (q12w CNTO 1275) or withdrawal of therapy (placebo).

The study planned to randomize approximately 750 subjects at 60 sites. A total of 766 subjects were randomly assigned to treatment at 48 sites at Week 0.

This study is currently ongoing with a 5-year long-term extension phase.

Study  PHOENIX  2: This  was  a  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial evaluating  efficacy  and  safety  of  ustekinumab  in  the  treatment  of  subjects  with  moderate  to  severe plaque psoriasis. The study planned to randomize approximately 1200 subjects at 75 sites. A total of 1230  subjects  were  randomly  assigned  to  treatment  at  70  sites  at  Week  0.  The  study  is  currently ongoing with a 5-year long-term extension phase.

Both studies were designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 dosing regimens of CNTO 1275:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 45 mg at Week 0 and 4 followed by 45 mg q12w maintenance therapy (45 mg q12w regimen);
- 90 mg at Week 0 and 4 followed by 90 mg q12w maintenance therapy (90 mg q12w regimen).

Study PHOENIX 1: The safety and efficacy of these 2 regimens are to be evaluated during 4 study periods occurring over approximately 5 years:

- A 12-week placebo-controlled period;
- A subsequent 28-week placebo crossover and active treatment period;
- A randomized-withdrawal period begins at Week 40 ;
- A long-term extension period begins at Week 52 for an additional 4 years.

This report provided by the MAA primarily includes analyses from the first 3 of these 4 study periods, and  includes  all  data  available  through  the  date  the  last  subject  completed  the  Week  52  visit  (i.e. through the end of the reporting period).

Study  PHOENIX 2: The safety  and  efficacy  of  these  2  regimens  will  be  evaluated  during  4  study periods occurring over approximately 5 years:

- A 12-week placebo-controlled period ;
- A subsequent 16-week placebo crossover and active treatment period ;
- A 24-week dose schedule optimization period beginning at Week 28;
- A long-term extension period begins at Week 52 for a total of approximately 4 years.

This report includes analyses from the first 2 of these 4 study periods, and includes all data available through Week 28, up to but not including, the Week 28 administration of study agent.

## Treatments

Study PHOENIX 1: Patients were randomised to placebo, or 45 mg (Group 1) or 90 mg  ustekinumab s.c. (Group 2)  at  Weeks 0, 4, and 16. At Week 12, subjects randomised to placebo were randomised to 45 mg or 90 mg  ustekinumab at Weeks 12 and 16.

Randomisation was stratified by investigational site, weight ( ≤ 90 kg or &gt; 90 kg), and whether there were  less  than  3  or  at  least  3  previous  conventional  therapies  (i.e.  psoralen  plus  UVA  light, methotrexate,  acitretin, cyclosporine) to which the subject had an inadequate response,  intolerance, or contraindication.

At Week 40, patients in Groups 1 and 2 who were PASI 75 responders at Weeks 28 and

40 were randomised to continue maintenance therapy every twelve weeks or to placebo. The second randomisation was stratified by investigational site and baseline weight ( ≤ 90 kg or &gt; 90 kg).

Study  PHOENIX  2:  Patients  were  randomised  to  placebo  or  to  45  mg  (Group  1)  or  90  mg ustekinumab s.c. (Group 2)  at  Weeks 0, 4, and 16. At Week 12, patients randomised to placebo were to receive 45 mg or 90 mg ustekinumab at Weeks 12 and 16.  Pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety variables  were  evaluated  over  twenty-eight  weeks,  and  anti  -  ustekinumab  antibody  formation  over twenty-four weeks.

## Objectives

The primary objective of study PHOENIX 1 and study PHOENIX 2 was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in the treatment of subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

The secondary objectives of study PHOENIX 1 were to evaluate the maintenance of response with ustekinumab and to evaluate the impact of ustekinumab on QOL.

Secondary objectives of study PHOENIX 2 were to evaluate the impact of ustekinumab on quality of life  and  to  evaluate  dosing  interval  adjustment  in  subjects  who  inadequately  respond  to  the  starting dose regimen of ustekinumab. Results of this period of the study (Week 28 to Week 52) have been reported in the 52-Week CSR provided during the procedure.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The  primary  endpoint  of  both  study  PHOENIX  1  and  study  PHOENIX  2  was  the  proportion  of subjects  who  achieved  improvement  from  baseline  in  PASI  (Psoriasis  Area  and  Severity  Index)  75 response at Week 12.

Major  Secondary  Endpoints  for  both  studies  were:  1)  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  PGA (Physician's  Global  Assessment)  score  of  cleared  or  minimal  at  week  12;  2)  The  change  in  DLQI

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(Dermatology Life Quality Index) score from baseline at week 12; 3) Assessment at week 12 of PASI 50, PASI 90, PASI 100.

To evaluate the optimal treatment regimen with CNTO 1275, the Phase 3 program assessed:

·  Initial  efficacy  of  2  different  doses  of  CNTO  1275  (STELARA,  ustekinumab)  versus  placebo through Week 12;

· Efficacy of 2 different doses of CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab) administered as initial and maintenance therapy over time (through Week 40 in PHOENIX 1 and through Week 28 in PHOENIX 2);

·  Efficacy  of  maintenance  therapy  (ie,  maintenance  therapy  versus  placebo  after  randomized withdrawal at Week 40) in PHOENIX 1.

In both Phase 3 studies, the placebo group crossed over to CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab) at Week 12, so comparisons of initial CNTO 1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab) efficacy versus placebo are limited to 12 weeks.

Study PHOENIX 1: To evaluate longer term efficacy, psoriasis improvement was assessed over time by PASI and PGA from Week 12 through Week 40, after the placebo group crossed over to CNTO 1275.    The  efficacy  of  maintenance  therapy  was  evaluated  using  a  randomized  withdrawal  design. Multiple  analyses  were  used  to  measure  the  efficacy  of  maintenance  therapy,  including  the  major secondary  endpoint  of  time  to  loss  of  PASI  75  response.  To  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  retreatment, subjects  withdrawn  from  therapy  reinitiated  their  original  CNTO  1275  (STELARA,  ustekinumab) regimen  when  they  experienced  loss  of  therapeutic  effect  (ie,  loss  of  50%  of  their  Week  40  PASI improvement) were assessed by PASI 75 response relative to week 0.  To examine whether subjects who inadequately respond to q12w dosing may respond to dosing interval adjustment, subjects who were partial responders at Week 28 ( ≥ 50% to &lt; 75% improvement in PASI from baseline) underwent dosing interval adjustment to q8w dosing and were assessed. Safety and efficacy analyses for subjects who adjusted to q8w administrations were observational in nature since no control group was available for comparison.

Study PHOENIX 2: To evaluate the maintenance of response, psoriasis improvement was assessed over  time  by  PASI  and  PGA  from  Week  12  through  Week  28.  The  impact  of  weight  on  psoriasis improvement PASI 75 response rates at Week 12 and through week 28 were analyzed by approximate body weight quartiles and subpopulations based on 10-kg increments in weight.

The impact of self-administration on efficacy was evaluated by assessing PASI response in subjects who  self-administered  versus  healthcare  professional  administration  of  CNTO  1275  (STELARA, ustekinumab) at Week 16.

The hospital anxiety and depression scale and work limitations questionnaire were also used to assess patient reported outcomes.

Improvements  in  quality  of  life  were  also  assessed  by  the  Hospital  Anxiety  and  Depression  Scale (HADS) and the Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ).

The impact of CNTO 1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab) on health economics measures was assessed by measuring employment status, the number of work days missed due to psoriasis, and the change from baseline in subjects' reported productivity.

## Sample size

Study  PHOENIX  1:  A  total  of  984  subjects  were  screened  and  766  subjects  were  randomized  to treatment. All 255 subjects randomized to 45 mg received at least 1 dose of 45 mg and 255 of 256 subjects randomized to 90 mg received at least one dose of 90 mg. Of the 255 subjects randomized to placebo,  all  subjects  received  placebo  at  Week  0.  At  Week  12,  123  (96.9%)  of  the  127  placebo subjects randomized to Group 3a crossed over to 45 mg, and 120 (93.8%) of the 128 placebo subjects randomized to Group 3b crossed over to 90 mg.

The safety population through the end of the reporting period, therefore included:

- 255 subjects treated with placebo through Week 12
- 123 subjects in the placebo → 45 mg group
- 120 subjects in the placebo → 90 mg group
- 255 subjects in the 45 mg group
- 255 subjects in the 90 mg group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study PHOENIX 2: A total of 1567 subjects were screened, and 1230 subjects were randomized to treatment.  All  randomized  subjects  received  treatment  in  the  study.  The  safety  population  through Week 28, therefore included:

- 410 subjects treated with placebo through Week 12
- 197 subjects in the placebo → 45 mg group
- 195 subjects in the placebo → 90 mg group
- 409 subjects in the 45 mg group
- 411 subjects in the 90 mg group.

## Randomisation

Both study PHOENIX 1 and study PHOENIX 2: Subject allocation to a treatment group at Week 0 (or Week 40 for study PHOENIX 1) was performed using a centralized IVRS provided by Clinphone. Subjects  were  randomized  to  a  treatment  group  using  a  minimization  algorithm  with  a  biased  coin assignment (Pocock and Simon, 1975).

At Week 0, eligible subjects were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups as follows:

Group 1:  ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by 45 mg q12w;

Group 2:  ustekinumab 90 mg at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by 90 mg q12w;

Group 3: Placebo at Weeks 0 and 4 (half the subjects in this group were randomized to

Group  3a  at  Week  0  to  crossover  to    ustekinumab  45  mg  at  Weeks  12  and  16,  and  half  were randomized to Group 3b at Week 0 to crossover to  ustekinumab 90 mg at Weeks 12 and 16).

The randomization at Week 0 was stratified by investigational site, weight ( ≤ 90 kg or &gt; 90 kg), and whether there were &lt; 3 or ≥ 3  conventional  therapies  (ie,  psoralen  plusultraviolet  A  light  [PUVA], methotrexate [MTX], acitretin, and cyclosporine) to which  the subject had an inadequate response, intolerance, or contraindication.

## Blinding (masking)

Study PHOENIX 1: To maintain the blind associated with CNTO 1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab) dose  administration,  each  subject  randomized  to  CNTO  1275  (STELARA,    ustekinumab)  was  also given  a  placebo  injection;  subjects  in  the  45  mg  group  received  a  1.0  mL  placebo  injection,  and subjects receiving 90 mg also received a 0.5 mL placebo injection. Two lots of placebo (D05PE7429 and D05PE7430) were used. The site monitors, investigators, and site personnel associated with the conduct of the study, and subjects in the study were to be blinded to treatment assignment until the Week 76 database is finalized and locked. To maintain the blind, all administrations were to be given as  2  SC  injections,  1  syringe  containing  0.5  mL  and  1  syringe  containing  1.0  mL  of  study  agent. Unblinding of treatment information for individual subjects was allowed for specific safety reasons and required a request from the investigator on an individual subject basis. To receive the treatment group assignment of a specific subject, an investigator had to contact the Centocor medical monitor or designee.

Study PHOENIX 2: At the Week 28 database lock, the treatment assignment at Week 0 was unblinded to the Sponsor for analysis while subjects were still being followed in the study. The site monitors, investigators, site personnel associated with the conduct of the study and subjects in the study are to be blinded to treatment assignment until the Week 52 database is locked and finalized. To maintain the blind,  all  administrations  were  to  be  given  as  2  SC  injections,  1  syringe  containing  0.5  mL  and  1 syringe containing 1.0 mL of  study agent.  Emergency unblinding is performed as for PHOENIX 1.

## Statistical methods

Subject  allocation  to  treatment  group  used  a  minimisation  algorithm  with  stratification  factors  of weight ( ≤ 90 kg or &gt;90kg) and the number of previous therapies to which the patient had been exposed or was intolerant to.

The applicant measured PASI75 responders at week 12, as well as PGA responders at week 12. The difference  in  responder  proportions  between  each  level  of  ustekinumab  and  placebo  was  calculated and 95% confidence intervals presented. PASI90 responder rates and PASI50 responder rates were also provided. Missing data was handled using last observation carried forward (LOCF). The applicant provided 3 different methods for handling missing data to test the sensitivity of using LOCF: a perprotocol population, a method assuming all missing data are failures, and a method based on linear interpolation of results.

PHOENIX 1: subject disposition at week 0 randomization.

Disposilon ot Sutjects

Figure 2 Subject disposition through the date the last subject completed Week 52;subjects randomized at Week 0

<!-- image -->

The  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  in  the  ustekinumab  groups  was  Other  (7  [1.4%]), including 1 (0.4%) subject in the 45 mg group who discontinued study agent after requiring use of a prohibited  medication,  and  6  (2.3%)  subjects  in  the  90  mg  group,  3  who  were  discontinued  after randomization because they were in violation of eligibility criteria, 2 who discontinued because they moved and were no longer able to participate in the study, and 1 who was discontinued due to noncompliance.

In  the  placebo  group,  the  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  of  study  agent  was  an  AE  (6 [2.4%]).  Notably,  6  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  discontinued  study  agent  due  to  a  lack  of improvement of psoriasis, (3 [1.2%] subjects had an AE of worsening of psoriasis and 3 [1.2%] had unsatisfactory therapeutic effect), compared with no subjects treated with 45 mg and 1 [0.2%] subject treated with 90 mg who had unsatisfactory therapeutic effect.

## PHOENIX 1: subject disposition at week 40 randomization.

<!-- image -->

A total of 100 (13.1%) subjects permanently discontinued study agent administration through the end of the reporting period.

A greater proportion of subjects discontinued study agent in the 45 mg group than in the 90 mg group (40 [15.7%] and 32 [12.5%], respectively). This small disparity was attributable to a greater proportion of subjects discontinuing therapy at Week 28 in the 45 mg group because they were non-responders and discontinued per protocol (i.e. Landmark visit (Week 28) non-responder per protocol; 17 [6.7%] subjects in the 45 mg group compared with 5 [2.0%] in the 90 mg group). The proportion of subjects discontinuing study agent was similar in the placebo → 45 mg group and placebo → 90 mg group (14

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

[11.0%]  and  14  [10.9%],  respectively).  Of  note,  the  placebo → 45  mg  and  the  placebo → 90  mg columns  included  discontinuations  during  the  placebo  period  (i.e.  through  Week  12).  The  most frequent reason for discontinuation of study agent administration for all treatment groups combined was AEs (4.3%). Generally similar proportions of subjects discontinued study agent due to AEs in all treatment groups.

A  total of 25 (3.3%) subjects among  all treatment groups recorded 'other' as reason for discontinuation  of  study  agent  administration  through  the  end  of  the  reporting  period.  The  most common responses for the 'other' category included noncompliance with the protocol. Subjects who discontinued due to an AE of worsening psoriasis or unsatisfactory therapeutic effect were counted as treatment failures.

## PHOENIX 2:

<!-- image -->

In  PHOENIX 2 a  total  of  66  (5.4%)  subjects  permanently  discontinued  study  agent  administration through  Week  28,  as  shown  in  Table  4.  The  proportion  of  subjects  discontinuing  study  agent  was similar in the 45 mg and 90 mg groups (18 [4.4%] and 19 [4.6%], respectively). The proportion of subjects discontinuing study agent was also similar in the placebo → 45 mg group and the placebo → 90 mg group (15 [7.3%] and 14 [6.8%], respectively). Of note, the placebo → 45 mg and the placebo → 90 mg columns included discontinuations during the placebo-controlled period (i.e. through Week 12).  The  most  frequent  reason  for  discontinuation  of  study  agent  administration  for  all  treatment groups combined was AEs. Generally similar proportions of subjects discontinued study agent due to AEs in all treatment groups. A total of 21 (1.7%) subjects among all treatment groups recorded 'other' as reason for discontinuation and the most common responses for the 'other' category included noncompliance with the protocol.

## Conduct of the study

To  ensure  balance  across  treatment  arms,  a  minimisation  algorithm  with  a  biased  coin  design  was used, to ensure balance across weight ( ≤ 90 kg or &gt; 90 kg) and the number of systemic therapies each patient had failed (&lt; 3 or ≥ 3).

## Baseline data

Baseline disease characteristics were well matched in all studies.  After randomization demographics and disease characteristics were well matched between groups.

## Numbers analysed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The numbers analysed were sufficient to demonstrate strong statistical and clinical significance for the superiority of ustekinumab over placebo for the treatment of psoriasis.

## Outcomes and estimation

PASI 75, PGA and DLQI were most common measures of disease response in all trials.  Efficacy measures  were  incorporated  into  the  Phase  3  studies  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  CNTO  1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab)  on  skin  and  nail  psoriasis,  on  itch,  on  quality  of  life,  and  on  health economics. All aspects of psoriasis were evaluated by standard assessments that are all well accepted. Additionally, quality of life assessments allowed a measure of efficacy from the subject's perspective.

· Measures of skin psoriasis in both PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2 included PASI and the static PGA (of disease severity);

· Nail psoriasis was measured in PHOENIX 1 using the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI), a Nail PGA, and the number of nails involved by psoriasis;

• Itch was measured in PHOENIX 1 by a visual analog scale (itch VAS);

DLQI score was evaluated in both studies as a measure of the impact of CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab) treatment on quality of life. Additionally, the SF-36 was used to evaluate quality of life in PHOENIX 1, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Work Limitations Questionnaire  (WLQ)  were  used  to  evaluate  quality  of  life  in  PHOENIX  2.  Health  economic assessments were evaluated in both studies using measures of subjects' employment status, time lost from work, and daily productivity.

## Study PHOENIX 1:

Information on the efficacy of ustekinumab is provided in 3 of the 4 study periods in PHOENIX 1 the  placebo-controlled  period  (Weeks  0-12),  the  active  treatment  period  (Weeks  12-40  when  all subjects received CNTO 1275), and the randomized withdrawal period (Week 40 through the end of the reporting period). Since data were collected through the date the last subject completed the Week 52 visit, a small amount of data after Week 52 are included (during the long-term extension period). There was significant improvement in the PASI 75, PASI 90 and PGA of the two treatment groups compared with placebo over the first 12 weeks.

There  was very strong statistical evidence for  the  superiority  of  CNTO  1275  (STELARA, ustekinumab)  over  placebo  for  the  treatment  of  psoriasis  as  measured  by  PASI  75.  There  was  no evidence of an important difference between the 2 doses at this 12 week time-point.

The applicant also provided 3 sensitivity analyses to asses the impact of using LOCF to handle the missing data, the most conservative of which was to assume all missing data were treatment failures. The results for this were identical to the ones above, as the last observation of all missing individuals was one of treatment failure.

Dose response separation began to emerge at Week 16, when 72.2% of subjects in the 90 mg group achieved a PASI 75 response compared with 67.7% of subjects in the 45 mg group. This separation in response rates peaked at approximately 24 weeks and generally persisted through Week 40 (the last timepoint before the randomized withdrawal portion of the study).

To evaluate longer term efficacy, psoriasis improvement was assessed over time by PASI from Week 12 through Week 40, after the placebo group crossed over to CNTO 1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab) (Figure 3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 3 PHOENIX 1.  Percent of subjects achieving PASI 75 response from Week 12 through Week 40 by visit; subjects randomized at Week 0

<!-- image -->

The majority of subjects achieved a PASI 90 response with response rates observed around Week 24 in both the 45 mg (55.8%) and 90 mg (63.4%) groups (see Figure 15). The periodicity of response, i.e., the slightly higher response rates 4 and 8 weeks post dose compared with the 12 weeks post dose response, was also observed with PASI 90 responses but was not apparent with PASI 50 responses, which remained generally stable after reaching their maximum.

## Impact of CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab) on Nail Psoriasis

By Week 12, nail psoriasis was significantly improved in subjects treated with ustekinumab compared with  the  placebo  group  as  measured  by  NAPSI.  The  median  percent  improvement  in  NAPSI  from baseline to Week 12 was 25.0% in both ustekinumab groups compared with 0% in the placebo group (p &lt; 0.001 for comparison of the 45 mg group versus the placebo group; p = 0.001 for comparison of the 90 mg group versus the placebo group.

Nail psoriasis showed similar improvements in subjects in the placebo → 45 mg and placebo → 90 mg  groups.  Combined,  these  results  suggest  that  the  magnitude  of  improvement  in  nail  psoriasis continued to improve over time through Week 24 and that 45 mg and 90 mg dosing led to a similar magnitude of improvement.

Impact of CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab) on Quality of Life Table 15 Number of subjects with a reduction of 5 or more from baseline in DLQI score at Week 12; subjects randomized at Week 0 Improvements at Week 12 were sustained at Weeks 28 and 40. Additionally, the placebo → 45 mg and placebo → 90 mg groups had improvements in DLQI score at Weeks 28 and 40 that were similar in  magnitude to those seen in subjects initially randomized to ustekinumab. During the randomized withdrawal period, DLQI score improvements observed at Week 40 were generally sustained at Week 52 in subjects randomized to maintenance therapy. In contrast, the improvement in DLQI score was lower  at  Week  52  (compared  with  Week  40)  in  subjects  withdrawn  from  ustekinumab,  indicating impairment in QOL after 1 missed ustekinumab dose.

No  notable  between-group  differences  were  observed  for  employment  status.  In  both  ustekinumab groups treatment resulted in a reduction in the number of work days missed due to psoriasis at Week 12.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study PHOENIX 2:

Study  PHOENIX  2  enrolled  1230  subjects  and  the  randomization  of  subjects  to  treatment  was stratified  based  on  investigational  site,  weight  ( ≤ 90  kg  or  &gt;  90  kg),  and  previous  experience  with conventional systemic therapies (inadequate response to, intolerance to, or contraindication to &lt; 3 or ≥ 3  conventional  systemic  therapies  including  cyclosporine,  MTX,  acitretin,  and  PUVA).  As  in PHOENIX 1, it  was  estimated  that  approximately  10%  of  subjects  would  have  had  an  inadequate response  to,  intolerance  to,  or  contraindication  to ≥ 3  conventional  systemic  therapies,  and  since PHOENIX  2  was  even  larger  than  PHOENIX  1,  the  study  was  also  adequately  powered  to demonstrate efficacy in this subpopulation.

Figure  5  Percent  of  subjects  achieving  PASI  75  response  through  Week  12  by  visit;  subjects randomized at Week 0 in PHOENIX 2.

<!-- image -->

Patterns of efficacy over time from Week 12 through Week 28 were generally similar when measured by different PASI thresholds, by PGA, and by continuous measures of response (e.g. median percent PASI improvement) though magnitude of response varied according to the threshold.

Efficacy  with  ustekinumab  1275  continued  to  improve  after  the  placebo-controlled  portion  of  the study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 6 Percent of subjects achieving PASI 75 response from Week 12 through Week 28 by visit; subjects randomized at Week 0 in PHOENIX 2

<!-- image -->

Clinical response (improvement in PASI) was related to serum ustekinumab levels.

Subjects  treated  with  ustekinumab  demonstrated  significant  improvements  in  quality  of  life  that generally  paralleled  their  PASI  responses.  Significant  improvements  in  DLQI  scores  were  noted  as early as Week 4 in each ustekinumab group compared with placebo and continued to improve at Week 12.

An analysis of efficacy over time from Week 16 through Week 28 showed that PASI response rates were  similar  in  subjects  self-administering  ustekinumab  and  in  those  in  whom  ustekinumab  was administered by a healthcare professional.

Both  Study  PHOENIX  1  and  Study  PHOENIX  2  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  ustekinumab  over placebo  in  the  treatment  of  plaque  psoriasis  when  measured  by  PASI,  PGA  and  QOL  readouts. Efficacy was shown for adult patients with psoriasis with PASI, PGA and DLQ index scores when compared with placebo. With long-term treatment (up to 40 weeks) the response was durable. There was some evidence of the efficacy of re-treatment in subjects who lost 50% of their PASI response on discontinuing therapy in PHOENIX 1.

## Long-term efficacy and efficacy of re-treatment

During the procedure the Applicant provided the week 76 CSR for PHOENIX 1.  The data from this demonstrated that efficacy is maintained through week 76 (See Figure 5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The efficacy of re-treatment was assessed and this was evident whether measured by PASI, PGA or DLQI. (Attachment 3.11 below), as was relapse within 8 weeks on withdrawal of therapy.

## Active comparator trial

The Applicant provided the week 12 CSR for ACCEPT is a multicenter (67 sites), randomized, activecontrolled,  parallel,  3-arm  study  of  SC  injections  of  ustekinumab  45  mg,  ustekinumab  90  mg,  and etanercept 50 mg (twice weekly) in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis. The active-controlled portion of the study was from Week 0 to Week 12, during which the efficacy and safety of etanercept and ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg were evaluated. The second part of the study, beginning at Week 12, will evaluate interruption of therapy and re-treatment. Treatment after Week 12 is dependent on PGA  response  at  Week  12  and  initial  treatment  assignment.  The  final  (Week  64)  CSR  will  be available mid-2009.

The data provided with this trial demonstrated that ustekinumab was superior to etanercept.

## Ancillary analyses

-  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Cross-study comparisons of efficacy focused on comparing results from the Phase 3 studies where the same  dosing  regimens  were  used.  The  Phase  3  study  designs  were  identical  for  28  weeks,  so  the comparisons  are  limited  to  this  time  period.  Cross-study  comparisons  focused  on  evaluating consistency in:

- The magnitude of treatment effect versus placebo;
- Dose-response in efficacy;
- Time to onset of efficacy and response over time.

For subgroups defined by the following variables, data were pooled from the Phase 3 (PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2) studies to provide a more precise estimate of efficacy:

- Age (&lt; 45 years, ≥ 45 to &lt; 65 years, ≥ 65 years);
- BMI (Normal [&lt; 25], overweight [ ≥ 25 to &lt;30], obese [ ≥ 30]);
- Prior exposure to phototherapy (UVB or PUVA), conventional systemics (PUVA, MTX, acitretin, or cyclosporine) or biologics (etanercept, alefacept, efalizumab, infliximab, or adalimumab);

·  Prior  experience  with  conventional  antipsoriatic  systemic  therapies  (inadequate  response  to,  were intolerant to, or had at a contraindication to PUVA, MTX, acitretin, or cyclosporine). Similar trends in efficacy were observed in these subpopulations in both Phase 3 studies, supporting the use of pooled data to provide a more precise estimate of treatment effect.

Demographics and baseline disease characteristics and previous use of systemic therapy for psoriasis were similar between the two phase 3 trials.

The primary endpoint of both PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2 examined the proportions of subjects achieving PASI 75 response at Week 12, and the first major secondary endpoint in each trial examined the proportions of subjects with a PGA score of cleared or minimal at Week 12.

The studies showed significant and reproducible improvements in psoriasis at Week 12 using either PASI or PGA response.

The  Phase  3  studies,  which  studied  identical  dosing  regimens,  met  the  primary  and  all  major secondary endpoints and showed remarkable consistency in the magnitude of effect by Week 28. A dose  response  in  efficacy  was  observed  in  PHOENIX  2,  with  approximately  10%  difference  in efficacy observed between the 45 and 90 mg groups, though similar differences were not observed in PHOENIX 1. Results of PHOENIX 2 are most consistent with previous observations in Phase 2, in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

which  approximately  10%  increments  in  PASI  75  response  were  observed  with  every  doubling  in exposure between 45 mg and 360 mg.

Both PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2 showed rapid onset of action of CNTO 1275, with approximately 10% of subjects in the 45 mg and 90 mg groups achieving a PASI 50 response by Week 2. The rapid and clinically significant improvements in psoriasis in both groups continued to increase over time, both in the proportions of responding subjects as well as in the magnitude of their response, through the  primary study endpoint at Week 12. Approximately 35 to 50% of subjects achieved a PASI 90 response  at  Week  12.  Similar  efficacy  with  CNTO  1275  (STELARA,  ustekinumab)  treatment  was observed when efficacy was assessed using the PGA.

Across PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2, the relationship of antibodies to efficacy was consistent in that subject's positive for antibodies tended to have lower efficacy.

A  significant proportion of subjects randomized  to  CNTO  1275  (STELARA,  ustekinumab) (approximately 36% from PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2 combined) achieved a DLQI score of 0 (ie, no  detectable  impairment  in  quality  of  life)  at  Week  12.  Similarly,  a  high  proportion  of  subjects achieved a reduction of 5 or more points in DLQI score at Week 12, which corresponds to a clinically important difference

Subgroup analysis of subjects with diabetes, weight, psoriasis medication history and demographics were consistent between the two trials.  The magnitude of the treatment effect was slightly lower in subjects who were ≥ 65  years  or  subjects  who  were  obese  (BMI ≥ 30),  though  still  significant  and substantial. For subjects who were ≥ 65 years of age, a slightly lower treatment effect was observed in the 90 mg group, which was also observed in PHOENIX 2. Since the number of subjects &gt;75 of age was limited in the Phase 3 studies (n = 11), efficacy analyses were not performed on this subgroup.

##  Clinical studies in special populations

Consistency of CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab) efficacy across relevant subpopulations was also evaluated in each Phase 3 study. Most of the subgroups evaluated were large enough to provide robust  assessments  within  each  of  the  individual  Phase  3  studies.  In  particular,  each  study  was adequately powered to demonstrate efficacy in a more restricted patient population of subjects who had an inadequate response to, were intolerant to, or had a contraindication to conventional systemic therapies including cyclosporine, methotrexate (MTX), acitretin, or psoralen plus ultraviolet A light (PUVA).

In the individual Phase 3 studies, efficacy was evaluated in subpopulations based on:

- Gender, race, and age.
- Geographic region.
- Duration of disease.
- Age at diagnosis.
- Body Mass Index (BMI) and weight.
- Disease severity including moderate and severe psoriasis (see below).
- Presence or absence of PsA as a comorbidity.
- Prior exposure to conventional systemic therapies, phototherapy, and biologics (etanercept, alefacept, efalizumab, infliximab, or adalimumab).

· Prior experience with conventional systemic therapies (inadequate response to, were intolerant to, or had a contraindication to PUVA, MTX, acitretin, or cyclosporine).

·  Prior experience with biologics (inadequate response to or were intolerant to etanercept, alefacept, efalizumab, infliximab, or adalimumab).

The main findings from analysis of these subpopulations was that:

-  There  is  consistently  very  strong  statistical  evidence  for  the  superiority  of  CNTO  1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab) over placebo, including in those who had an inadequate response, were intolerant, or were contraindicated to at least 3 conventional systemic therapies, both for the 45 mg and 90 mg doses. There is evidence of a dose response effect in both studies in this subgroup. In PHOENIX 2, this mirrors what happens in the overall population, whereas in PHOENIX  1,  no  overall  difference  was  seen  between  the  2  doses  in  patients  failing  two therapies or fewer.
-  90mg was more effective in patients over 100kg.

##  Supportive study(ies)

Supportive studies included the trial on psoriatic arthritis (which showed moderate efficacy in PsA), and  that  on  Multiple  Sclerosis  patients  (provided  additional  pharmacodynamic  immune  system). Patients from these trials and others contributed to the safety data provided by the Applicant in the day 120 Safety update Report.

A controlled trial (C0743T12) of 12 weeks data was presented, which supported superiority of Stelara over etanercept in terms of PASI responses and PGA at 12 weeks.

The primary objectives of this study were to compare the efficacy of ustekinumab to etanercept and evaluate the safety of ustekinumab and etanercept. The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of retreatment with ustekinumab.

This was a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, parallel, 3-arm study of SC injections of  ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 0 and 4, ustekinumab 90 mg at Weeks 0 and 4, and etanercept 50 mg twice weekly through Week 12 in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. 903 subjects were randomized to ustekinumab 45 mg, ustekinumab 90 mg, or etanercept 50 mg in a 3:5:5 ratio. Subjects were randomized in a 3:5:5 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups as follows:

Group 1: ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 0 and 4.

Group 2: ustekinumab 90 mg at Weeks 0 and 4.

Group 3: etanercept 50 mg twice weekly through Week 12.

This study revealed that in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, ustekinumab 45 mg and 90  mg  have  superior  efficacy  to  etanercept  50  mg  as  measured  by  PASI  and  PGA.  In  addition, ustekinumab  therapy  was  generally  well  tolerated  through  Week  12,  with  an  overall  safety  profile comparable to etanercept.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Discussion on clinical efficacy

The  efficacy  of  Stelara  in  PASI  (Psoriasis  Area  and  Severity  Index),  PGA  (Physician's  Global Assessment)  and  DLQI  (Dermatology  Life  Quality  Index)  scores  was  statistically  significantly superior to placebo and etanercept in plaque psoriasis after 12 weeks of treatment. The proportion of patients  achieving  PASI  75  response  at  week  12  was  72.2%  and  65%  on  45  mg  and  90  mg respectively versus 56.8% on etanercept. Approximately 35 to 50% of subjects achieved a PASI 90 response at week 12. Similar efficacy with Stelara treatment was observed when efficacy was assessed using the PGA.

The lack of a comparator was noted in the initially submitted dose-response studies. The effect was delayed taking &gt;6 weeks to achieve maximal effect, was weight and dose dependent, long-lasting (up to  12  weeks)  and  re-treatment  was  effective  in  those  who  did  not  respond  initially.  Subjects  with weight &gt;100kg had less response to the lower dose than did lighter subjects.

## Clinical safety

To evaluate the safety of ustekinumab, AEs and laboratory assessments were systematically captured in each clinical study and categorized by the investigator for seriousness, intensity, causality (assessed by the investigator), duration, and action taken with study drug. These AEs were then organized by system-organ  class  and  preferred  term  using  the  MedDRA  dictionary.  Safety  events  particularly relevant  in  the  psoriasis  population  were  also  evaluated,  such  as  psoriasis  rebound  and  flares  of psoriatic  arthritis.    Additionally,  targeted  analyses  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  impact  of ustekinumab on other comorbidities (eg, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes), and its impact on the rates of nonserious and serious cardiovascular events, death and hospitalization in the clinical study population compared with the rates observed in the general and/or psoriasis population.

AEs  that  were  classified  separately  were  infections,  infections  treated  with  oral  or  parenteral antibiotics and injection site reactions. Routine hematology and chemistry laboratory parameters were captured  at  selected  time-points  during  each  study.    Additionally,  tests  on  Subsets  of  lymphocytes, Electrocardiograms (ECGs) and Immune responses to vaccines were examined in the Phase 1 studies to assess immunocompetency. D-dimer levels were obtained at baseline and Week 12 in the Phase 3 studies as a surrogate marker of occult thrombosis, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were obtained at baseline  and  Week  12  as  a  surrogate  marker  of  cardiovascular  risk,  Fasting  glucose  levels  were examined at baseline and Week 12 in Phase 3 to evaluated the impact of ustekinumab on diabetes and Hemoglobin A1c levels were obtained at baseline and Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 52 in Phase 3 to evaluate the impact of  ustekinumab on glucose homeostasis over time.

##  Patient exposure

The safety database in the original application was deemed too small for an agent which blocks two cytokines  and  is  proposed  for  use  in  a  non  life-threatening  indication.  In  addition,  from  the  data available in the original application the safety profile seemed similar to placebo over a 12-week period but  no  longer  term  comparator  group  nor  an  active  comparator  group  were  present.  During  the procedure the Applicant provided significantly more safety data and the week 12 CSR of the ACCEPT trial where ustekinumab was compared with etanercept.

This  additional  data  provided  approximately  50%  more  safety  follow-up  in  the  2266  ustekinumabtreated subjects in the psoriasis Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. As shown in Table 29-3, a total of 1970 subjects were exposed for at least 6 months (an additional 368 since the initial MAA), 1285 subjects were exposed for at least 1 year (an additional 923), and 373 subjects were exposed for at least 18 months.

In addition to the additional data provided for 6 months for both the PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2 trials, the safety of ustekinumab was re-evaluated in data pooled across the Phase 2 and 3 studies in the 120-day Safety Update Report provided by the Applicant.

##  Adverse events

In the 2 completed Phase 1 studies (C0379T01 and C0379T02), no significant trends were observed in any  AEs,  which  were  generally  mild.  A  single  SAE  (exacerbation  of  herniated  lumbar  disc)  was reported in C0379T01.

The durationbetween the first and last ustekinumab administration was at least 38weeks.

dPartial injections are counted as full injections.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Compared with the short placebo-controlled period (12 weeks) the AEs of infection, malignancy and psychiatric disorders were increased (though not increased with increasing dose) and were similar to the results presented in the week 52 CSR.

The two cases of depression (031-0141 and 109-011) both had a past history of psychiatric disorder (one depression and one bipolar disorder). One subject (020-009) without a history of skin carcinoma or a congenital pre-disposition, with a history of PUVA treatment, developed 10 basal cell carcinomas. He was in the high dose (90mg) group (weight 109kg) and ustekinumab was stopped on day 333 after the  5 th BCC  was  identified.  While  the  severe  nature  of  the  multiple  BCCs  in  this  patient  raised concern, he was an isolated case from a large database of patients. Overall there were no new safety signals from the extended data is available from the week 76 CSR of Phoenix 1.

In general, the safety profile was similar across the placebo-controlled Phase 2 (C0379T04) and Phase 3 studies (PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2;). Adverse events were comparable across the placebo and combined CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab)    treatment groups. No increase in rates of AEs with increased CNTO 1275 (STELARA, ustekinumab) dose was noted. Injections were well tolerated. Rates  of  antibodies  were  low  and  not  associated  with  increased  rates  of  injection-site  reactions  or serious immunologic events including anaphylaxis or delayed hypersensitivity reactions.

Some notable differences occurred during the placebo-controlled period between the Phase 2 and the Phase 3 studies, particularly with regard to SAEs. SAEs occurred in 3.6% ustekinumab subjects and 1.5% in placebo subjects in Phase 2, whereas SAEs occurred at similar rates in the different treatment groups in both PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2.

During  the  common  placebo-controlled  portions  (through  Week  12)  and  through  to  the  end  of  the reporting period of the Phase 2 and 3 studies, the proportions of subjects who had at least 1 AE were comparable among the treatment groups. The proportions of subjects who had at least 1 AE did not increase with dose, and the most frequently reported class of AEs was infections and infestations.

To evaluate the impact of cumulative exposure to ustekinumab on the incidence of AEs, the number of AEs per hundred subject-years of follow-up was evaluated by quartiles of cumulative exposure in the Phase 3 psoriasis studies. Overall, rates of AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to study agent discontinuation per hundred subject-years of follow-up did not increase with increased exposure.

The  overall  rate  of  AEs  observed  in  the  studies  provided  with  the  initial  application  was  not statistically  different  between  the  groups  over  12-week  period.    However  the  lack  of  a  long-term placebo group made interpretation of any difference difficult. Overall, with the additional 6 months follow-up provided during the procedure:

The AE profiles observed were consistent with the patterns and rates of AEs reported in the initial MAA.

Duration  of  exposure  or  cumulative  exposure  to  ustekinumab  did  not  have  an  apparent  impact  on safety.  Rates  of  AEs,  SAEs,  infections,  and  AEs  leading  to  study  agent  discontinuation  did  not increase over time or with increasing length of exposure, and rates of these events did not appear to increase with increasing cumulative drug exposure.

The safety of retreatment was evaluated with additional data from the randomized withdrawal period of the PHOENIX 1 study. The overall pattern of AEs reported after retreatment with ustekinumab was generally  consistent  with  the  pattern  reported  in  the  overall  subject  population.  Rates  of  SAEs remained  low  and  no  cases  of  anaphylaxis  or  serum-sickness  like  reactions  were  reported  with retreatment.

Safety was also evaluated by analyzing targeted AEs that were identified based upon drug mechanism of action and specific risks in the target patient population. Rates of serious infections, malignancies, and  serious  cardiovascular  events  were  low  in  all  treatment  groups.  With  the  additional  6  months, follow-up-adjusted rates of these events remained generally comparable to rates reported in the initial MAA (see Table 29-6).

No additional adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were identified since the initial MAA.

Antibody  rates  remained  low  (approximately  5%  across  the  Phase  2  and  3  psoriasis  studies). Consistent  with  the  initial  MAA,  there  was  no  apparent  relationship  between  development  of antibodies to ustekinumab and development of injection site reactions.

°The total subject years of follow-up for malignancy is slightly lower since only the first event is counted in the calculation of incidence per 100 subject-years.

##  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

A 53-year-old woman in the 90 mg group in the PHOENIX 1 study was hospitalized for disseminated, cutaneous herpes zoster that developed 3 days after her first administration of study agent. She was treated  with  acyclovir,  and  the  viral  infection  resolved  without  complications,  but  led  to  permanent discontinuation of study agent.

The 2 most frequently reported classes of SAEs were cardiac disorders and infections and infestations, both of which occurred in 0.3% of subjects in the combined ustekinumab group. SAEs in the cardiac system-organ class were reported in 0.0%, 0.1%, and 0.5% of subjects in the placebo, 45 mg, and 90 mg groups, respectively. SAEs in the infections and infestations system organ class were reported in 0.4%, 0.0%, and 0.5% of subjects in these respective groups. No consistent pattern of individual SAEs was observed in the pooled psoriasis data or in the individual studies.

Through the End of the Reporting Period: Through the end of the reporting period, the proportions of subjects who had at least 1 SAE was comparable between the 45 mg and 90 mg groups (4.1% and 3.4%, respectively) The proportions of subjects who had at least 1 SAE in the placebo → 45 mg and the  placebo → 90  mg  groups  did  not  increase  with  increased  dose  (3.1%  and  1.6%,  respectively). Other SAEs occurred at comparable rates in subjects in the 45 mg and 90 mg groups. Of note, the proportion of serious infections through the end of the reporting period (0.7%) was comparable to the proportion  of  subjects  who  were  hospitalized  for  a  serious  infection  in  the  year  prior  to  study enrolment.

Infections, cardiac and psychiatric disorders were slightly higher in the 90mg dose group. This may be related  to  the  higher  weight  and  pre-existing  risk  factors  in  these  subjects.  There  were  more malignancies  in  the  treated  group  but  overall  standardised  incidence  ratios  suggested  no  difference between placebo and treated patients.

A 33-year-old  man  died  during  the  psoriasis  clinical  studies  from  sudden  cardiac  death  thought  to result from a dilated cardiomyopathy. The subject was in the 90 mg group, and his death occurred 5 days  after  receiving  the  Week  4  administration  of  ustekinumab.  Relevant  medical  history  included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and seizure disorder, and the subject had a syncopal episode 9 weeks before being randomised (which was unknown to the investigator).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Histology  analysis  of  the  cardiomyopathy-related  death  revealed  that  the  heart  was  hypertrophied (weighing 640 gm, compared to a normal weight for height and gender of 390 gm). There was no significant coronary artery disease, valvular disease, or other structural abnormalities. There was no microscopic evidence of myocarditis or ischemic injury. The findings were characteristic of dilated cardiomyopathy.  There  were  no  microscopic  abnormalities  other  than  the  evidence  of  hypertrophy, and  no  evidence  for  an  underlying  etiology.  It  was  noted  that  hypertrophy  of  the  heart  is  a  slow, progressive  process  that  occurs  over  years  and  therefore  it  is  almost  impossible  for  a  heart  to hypertrophy to that extent during the 5 weeks that the subject was in the clinical psoriasis study.

This additional data on the case of death with cardiomyopathy clarified the probable case and made it unlikely that ustekinumab was implicated.

No  deaths  were  reported  through  week  76  for  PHOENIX  1.  The  two  deaths  observed  in  subjects participating through Week 52 in the PHOENIX 2 study were probably not linked to ustekinumab. One subject (placebo → 45  mg  group) was a 63-year-old man who died from a possible aspiration (final  pathology report pending) after reaching Week 44 of the study (crossover to active treatment occurred at Week 12). The other subject was a 43-year-old woman who died from a post-operative intra-abdominal bleed resulting in hemorrhagic shock the day after undergoing an elective hysterectomy and an umbilical hernia repair. She had reached Week 60 of the study and was in the 90 mg group.

##  Laboratory findings

In the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, review of the T-lymphocyte subset profiles indicated a high degree of variability and no consistent effect of ustekinumab on T-lymphocyte subsets. Overall, there was no evidence of any relationship between ustekinumab and changes in lymphocyte subset counts. While markedly abnormal changes in overall lymphocytes were common in all studies (occurring in more than  1%  of  the  study  populations),  rates  were  generally  not  higher  in  ustekinumab-treated  subjects than in placebo-treated subjects, and no dose-effect was observed.

In  Phase  2,  markedly  abnormal  increases  in  non-fasting  glucose  levels  were  observed  in  more ustekinumab-treated  subjects  (9.5%)  than  subjects  treated  with  placebo  (4.5%)  during  the  placebocontrolled period. Nonetheless, more detailed analyses were undertaken in Phase 3, including analyses of fasting glucose levels and hemoglobin A1c. Analyses in each of the Phase 3 studies suggested that ustekinumab does not adversely impact fasting glucose levels or glucose homeostasis.

No significant dose-related changes were noted in CRP or D-dimers.

##  Immunological events

The incidence of antibodies to ustekinumab was low and was similar (approximately 4%) across the psoriasis studies. Of the 753 subjects treated with ustekinumab in PHOENIX 1, 746 had samples that were tested  for  antibodies  to  ustekinumab.  Between  Week  52  and  Week  76,  no  additional  subjects became antibody positive.

Most  of  the  subjects  in  the  withdrawal  therapy  groups  at  Week  52  had  undetectable  serum ustekinumab concentrations, suggesting that antibody positive rate did not increase on re-treatment. In addition, the presence of antibodies did not preclude a response to ustekinumab.

##  Safety in special populations

No specific studies were performed in patients &gt; 65g. No studies were performed in children.

##  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

None identified, but patients on immunosuppressive therapy were excluded from the trials.

##  Discontinuation due to adverse events

No patterns emerged from the AEs that led to discontinuation.

During  the  common  placebo-controlled  portions  of  the  Phase  2  and  3  studies,  the  proportions  of subjects who discontinued study agent because of an AE was comparable among the treatment groups (1.9%, 1.1%, and 1.4% in the placebo, 45 mg, and 90 mg groups, respectively). Most events occurred in only 1 subject in each treatment group, with the exception of psoriasis and exfoliative dermatitis, which occurred in 5 and 2 subjects, respectively, in the placebo group. The most frequently reported AE leading  to  study  agent  discontinuation  in  ustekinumab-treated  subjects  occurred  in  the  systemorgan class of neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified (0.0%, 0.3%, and 0.3% in the placebo, 45 mg, and 90 mg groups, respectively). Two subjects each in the 45 mg and 90 mg groups discontinued study agent because of neoplasms (1 subject with a basal cell cancer in each group; 1 subject with prostate  cancer  in  the  45  mg  group  and  1  subject  with  a  benign  meningioma  in  the  90  mg  group). Discontinuation of study agent was mandatory per protocol in subjects diagnosed with a malignancy of any kind, including skin cancer. Of note, 2 subjects in the placebo group also discontinued study agent  because  of  a  malignancy  or  a  malignancy-related  AE  but  are  not  listed  in  this  system-organ class.

Through  the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  the  frequency  of  subjects  who  discontinued  study  agent because of an AE was low. The proportions of subjects who had at least 1 AE leading to study agent discontinuation  were  comparable  between  the  45  mg  and  90  mg  groups  (3.0%  in  each  group),  and comparable in the placebo crossover groups (1.9% and 0.8% in the placebo → 45 mg and placebo → 90 mg groups, respectively).

Among the 124 subjects who were evaluated for safety of retreatment, 2 subjects in the 45 mg group had  AEs  leading  to  study  agent  discontinuation  after  retreatment  with  ustekinumab.  1  subject discontinued study agent for psoriasis, and 1 subject discontinued study agent for cellulitis, urinary tract  infection,  nephrolithiasis,  compartment  syndrome,  headache,  and  anxiety.  No  clear  pattern  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AEs  was  observed.  In  particular,  no  AEs  of  anaphylaxis  or  serum  sickness-like  reactions  were reported.

##  Post marketing experience

None.

##  Discussion on clinical safety

The adverse events predominantly associated with ustekinumab are infection and cardiovascular AEs. These  AEs  seemed  more  common  in  the  higher  dose  group,  however  the  safety  database  initially provided  was  small  and  there  was  no  comparator  group  to  assess  whether  the  AEs  are  treatmentrelated. Two pivotal trials supported by a phase 2 and two phase 1 trials were performed. 1970 patients only were exposed to ustekinumab in clinical studies. Of these 1599 (85%) were psoriasis. Overall 14% of patients were exposed for over 6 months, and none were exposed for more than one year. In the psoriasis patients only 5% were exposed for at least 6 months.

From the initial data the safety profile seemed similar to placebo over a 12-week period but there was no longer term comparator group. Further data from the then ongoing trial at week 52 were requested. There was a slight increase in infection (including one disseminated herpes infection) and there was one sudden death (cardiomyopathy-related) in a 33yr old man -and both of these occurred in patients on  the  high  dose.    The  incidence  of  anti-ustekinumab  antibody  detection  was  limited  as  serum ustekinumab  interfered  with  the  assay.    5%  of  subjects  in  PHOENIX  1  were  classed  as  antibody positive, and 47% as undetectable.

The  additional  safety  data  provided  did  not  identify  new  risks.  The  side  effects  included  infection (including  serious  infection),  cardiovascular  side  effects,  malignancies,  antibody  formation  and psychiatric disorders. The final safety database was significant, with data on a total of 2266 treated subjects,  of  whom  1970  treated  for  at  least  6  months,  1285  treated  for  at  least  12  months  and  373 treated for at least 18 months.

In the event of a significant adverse event (e.g. the development of a neoplasm) the long half-life of the product is a disadvantage. It should be noted that the pharmacodynamic effect of ustekinumab is irreversible until the plasma levels are very low and the function of the suppressed cell populations has recovered, which may be a period of months.

Risks associated with potentially life-long immunosuppression  exist, in common  with  other immunosuppressives. Risks pertaining to infections, malignancies, hypersensitivity reactions, depression,  concomitant  immunosuppressive  medication,  pregnancy,  lactation,  vaccinations  and  comorbidities (such as marked renal or hepatic impairment) are detailed in the SPC. In addition, Stelara is contraindicated in patients with a clinically important, active infection.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  Applicant  generally fulfils the legislative requirements and provides adequate evidence that the Applicant has the services of a qualified person responsible for Pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the collection and notification of any adverse reaction suspected of occurring in the Community or in a third country.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan.

Contraindication in section 4.3 'Contraindications' 'Clinically important, active infection.' Warning in section 4.4 'Special warnings and precautions for use' ' Infections ' 'ustekinumab may have the potential to increase the risk of infections and reactivate latent infections. In clinial studies, serious bacterial, fungal, and viral infections have been observed in patients receiving STELARA (see section 4.8). Caution should be exercised when considering the use of STELARA in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection (see section 4.3). Prior to initiating treatment with STELARA, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis infection. STELARA must not be given to patients with active tuberculosis (see section 4.3). Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection should be initiated prior to administering STELARA. Anti tuberculosis therapy should also be considered prior to initiation of STELARA in patients with a history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Patients receiving STELARA should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis during and after treatment. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. If a patient develops a serious infection, the patient should be closely monitored and STELARA should not be administered until the infection resolves.' Warning in section 4.4 'Special warnings and precautions for use' 'Malignancies ' 'Immunosuppressants like ustekinumab have the potential to increase the risk of malignancy. Some patients who received STELARA in clinical studies developed cutaneous and non cutaneous malignancies (see section 4.8). No studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or that continue treatment in patients who develop malignancy while receiving STELARA. Thus, caution should be exercised when considering the use of STELARA in these patients.' |

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the MA application is of the opinion that some risk minimisation activities are necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Within the RMP, there are considered to be no identified risks. Potential Risks identified are serious infections,  malignancy,  CV  events,  serious  systemic  hypersensitivity  reactions  and  exposure  during pregnancy. Immunogenicity is to be considered a potential risk and the Applicant has been requested to include pharmacological class effects of recombinant humanised monoclonal antibodies as potential risks.

In addition to routine pharmacovigilance the company has proposed to carry out additional studies.

-  Long-term  extensions  of  the  two  Phase  3  PSO  studies  are  ongoing,  with  plans  to  follow patients up for 5 years from the initial administration.
-  An etanercept comparator study is ongoing.
-  A PSO registry in the US is currently ongoing and collecting data on up to 4000 patients using ustekinumab.
-  A Nordic database initiative is planned, to collect data on adverse events and pregnancies in patients exposed to ustekinumab.
-  Follow up questionnaires will collect information on patients reporting certain AEs.
-  A Pregnancy Research Initiative is ongoing. This is a prospective 5 year observational study of pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women with prenatal exposure to ustekinumab.
-  A paediatric program is being developed.

Proposals should be submitted to collect data in patients of other ethnic origins. Detailed plans should be set out on how the risk of TB in all adults will be investigated.

Educational  programmes  are  proposed  to  minimise  the  risk  of  serious  infections  and  the  risk  of malignancies. The educational materials should be submitted.

## Pharmacovigilance Plan

This is satisfactory and will involve collection of data from patients at registries in the USA and also plans to collect data from patients in Europe.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

Based on the submitted data, the marketing authorisation application for Stelara is recommended for approval based on quality grounds.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The  non-clinical  data  provided  showed  that  Stelara  is  generally  well  tolerated  under  a  regimen  of twice  weekly  subcutaneous  dosing  at  45  mg/kg  for  6  months  in  cynomolgus  monkeys.  Adequate margins  of  exposure  over  the  human  clinical  exposure  were  demonstrated.    No  target  organs  were identified  and  there  was  no  delayed  toxicity  after  dosing  had  stopped.    The  possibility  of  immune suppression  could  not  be  ruled  out  in  the  case  of  one  animal  in  the  6-month  study  that  developed bacterial enteritis.

In  the  6-month  repeat-dose  study  and  the  embryo-fetal  developmental  toxicity  study,  antibodies  to ustekinumab were found in control samples, and these events were note clearly explained.

Overall,  it  was  not  possible  to  discern  whether  there  had  been  an  anti-antibody  response  to ustekinumab, although some animals were noted to have greater clearance than others.  This was not considered to have invalidated the studies and the pharmacokinetic indices were considered to show that adequate exposure was demonstrated.

ustekinumab had no effects on male fertility as assessed by spermatogenic measurements only.  In females, there were no effects on gestation, parturition, lactation or morphology and development of the offspring.

## Efficacy

The  efficacy  of  Stelara  in  PASI,  PGA  and  DLQI  scores  was  statistically  significantly  superior  to placebo and etanercept in plaque psoriasis after 12 weeks of treatment.  The proportion of patients achieving  PASI  75  response  at  week  12  was  respectively  72.2%  and  65%  on  45  mg  and  90mg respectively, versus 56.8% on Etanercept.  Approximately 35 to 50% of subjects achieved a PASI 90 response at Week 12. Similar efficacy with CNTO 1275 (STELARA,  ustekinumab)    treatment was observed when efficacy was assessed using the PGA.

Retreatment was effective and a response was maintained with continued treatment. The availability of an injection which can be self-administered and which is required only once every 12 weeks would benefit  patients  with  severe  disease  who  need  immunosuppressive  therapy.    The  lack  of  identified cumulative toxicity with biological therapies to date (in contrast to PUVA, methotrexate etc.) offers additional benefits.  Additional data from the ACCEPT trail demonstrated superiority compared with etanercept at 12 weeks.

## Safety

In common  with other immunosuppressives, the risks associated with potentially life-long immunosuppression exist.  In order to assess the degree of impairment of the systemic immune system the Applicant has committed to provide a protocol for a study investigating vaccine responses within an agreed pre-defined timeframe.

The risks identified with the additional safety data provided during the procedure are similar to those identified  from  the  data  submitted  initially.  The  side  effects  include  infection  (including  serious infection),  cardiovascular  side  effects,  malignancies,  antibody  formation  and  psychiatric  disorders. These risks have been highlighted in the SPC, with the exception of cardiovascular disease, which is listed  as  potential  risk  in  the  RMP.  Follow-up  information  about  this  potential  risk  will  be  made available post-marketing by means of regular PSURs.

The complete safety database is significant and consists of data on 2266 total treated subjects (1970 treated  for  at  least  6  months,  1285  treated  for  at  least  12  months  and  373  treated  for  at  least  18 months).

Risks  pertaining  to  infections,  malignancies,  hypersensitivity  reactions,  depression,  concomitant immunosuppressive  medication,  pregnancy,  lactation,  vaccinations  and  co-morbidities  (such  as marked renal or hepatic impairment) are detailed in the SPC. In addition, Stelara is contraindicated in patients with a clinically important, active infection.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

##  User consultation

A user testing of the PL for Stelara was performed.  Following an audience design step and a pilot test, two rounds of user testing (n=10) were performed on participants from the general public.  Although the expert patient had psoriasis, the subjects who participated in the user trial did not have psoriasis as an  inclusion  or  exclusion  criterion.  This  was  considered  satisfactory.    The  conclusions  were  clear, concise and well organised and the criteria of 90% finding and 90% understanding was reached in all questions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Risk-benefit assessment

The efficacy of  ustekinumab was demonstrated, together with long-term efficacy and also efficacy and safety of re-treatment. Superiority compared  with etanercept was  demonstrated. The subcutaneous  route  of  administration  offers  advantages  over  intravenous  administration  in  terms  of comfort and because it offers the possibility of home therapy. Infrequent injections are also a benefit.

The Applicant provided during the procedure significantly more safety data and in addition presented a  trial  where  an  active  comparator  was  used  (etanercept).  With  the  additional  data  provided  by  the Applicant during the procedure no new safety signals were detected and the larger safety database did not give rise to new concerns.

Because  of  the  nature  of  action  of  Stelara  (blocking  two  cytokines)  and  the  unexpected  increased incidence  of  cardiovascular  and  psychiatric  disease  (which  may  be  related  to  the  treatment)  the indicated  group  has  been  restricted  to  'those  who  have  failed  to  respond  to,  or  who  have  a contraindication  to,  or  are  intolerant  to  other  systemic  therapies  including  ciclosporin,  methotrexate and PUVA'. The overall benefit/risk ratio of Stelara in this restricted indication is positive.

The identified risks of infection, malignancy, psychiatric and immunological AEs are highlighted in the SPC and addressed in the RMP, and the quality FUM and vaccine response post-marketting studies commitment are fulfilled.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion  that  pharmacovigilance  activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine  pharmacovigilance  were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns. The following additional risk minimisation activities were required: see as details in section 2.3.

## Recommendation

Based on the review of the data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus decision that the risk-benefit balance of Stelara ( ustekinumab) in the treatment of  adult patients with moderate  to  severe  chronic  plaque  psoriasis  who  have  failed  to  respond  to,  or  who  have  a contraindication  to,  or  are  intolerant  to  other  systemic  therapies  including  ciclosporin,  methotrexate and PUVA, was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
