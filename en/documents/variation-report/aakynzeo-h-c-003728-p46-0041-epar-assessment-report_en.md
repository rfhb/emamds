## 1. Introduction

On 25 August 2020, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study (NEPA-15-31) for Akynzeo 300mg Netupitant/0.5mg Palonosetron hard capsules, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. This application was assessed as part or Procedure EMA/H/C/003728/P46/0004.

Following the initial assessment of that submission, two questions remained for the applicant to address, namely the characterisation of the safety profile of the excipients used in the product with respect to their use in children below the age of 3 years, and confirmation that two patients in the study had indeed received the correct dose of the product in the clinical trials.

Following on from this, the Applicant has submitted this application to clarity these remaining issues. As such, this report should be considered in the context of the original application.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH originally submitted a final report for:

- NEPA-15-31, A multicentre, multinational, randomized, double-blind, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) dose-finding study of oral netupitant administered concomitantly with oral palonosetron in paediatric cancer patients for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic chemotherapy.

At the conclusion of the original assessment, the CHMP was satisfied that the Post-authorisation measure had been fulfilled. However, there remained some aspects of the application which required further clarification, these were put to the applicant as follows;

Some minor points remain, primarily relating to the clarification of the safety profile of the excipients chosen for use in paediatric patients below the age of 3 years, and the exceptionally high exposure seen in two younger patient receiving the lower (1.33mg/Kg) netupitant dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The applicant is requested to provide a more detailed description of the safety profile of the excipients used, with particular regard to patients below the age of 3 years, as it is not clear whether the established safety profile of these substances in older children can be reliably extrapolated into this population (OC)

The applicant is asked to confirm that patient #101168 and #301141 both received the correct dose, and if so discuss the possible reasons for the exceptionally high Cmax seen in those patients. (OC)

The applicant has reverted with additional clarifications regarding these two remaining questions.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Please see the parent procedure EMA/H/C/003728/P46/0004 for details on the clinical study originally submitted as aprt of the now-fulfilled post-authorisation measure.

As regards the two outstanding issues, the response of the applicant and the assessor's comments therein are summarised below.

## Question 1

The applicant is requested to provide a more detailed description of the safety profile of the excipients used, with particular regard to patients below the age of 3 years, as it is not clear whether the established safety profile of these substances in older children can be reliably extrapolated into this population (OC)

## Summary of Applicant's Response

The applicant has further investigated the available information for each excipients used in the IMPs formulation in order to provide more detailed description. Reference has been made to the existing safety data from adult human and paediatric population and the corresponding use data in order to perform a comprehensive safety assessment including the safety concerns and risk from the use of the chosen excipients in the overall paediatric population.

Several sources of information have been used including publications and guidances, national databases related to approved drug products (dailymed, eMC, EMA), approved drug product excipients (FDA inactive ingredients database) and regulations on food additives and flavoring (e.g., EFSA Scientific Assessments, Joint Expert committee on food additives (JECFA); US FDA GRAS list) to determine the safety profile of these substances and the risks for all the paediatric age groups with a focus on the youngest ones (e.g. age below 3 years or age groups below 5 years).

The applicant is also aware that a reference list on excipients generally considered safe for use in paediatric formulations is not available yet and therefore this was a rationale for selecting only compendial grade excipients recognized as safe (GRAS) and extensively used in children, taking into account that excipients are necessary ingredients of drug products particularly in oral paediatric formulations where taste remains a key aspect to ensure compliance and the delivery of the therapeutic dose; this also combined to the need to limit the number and amount of each excipient to the minimum necessary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As first step, an evaluation has been performed on the broad use of all the excipients chosen for Netupitant Paediatric Oral Suspension in pharmaceutical oral dosage forms for approved drug products, their Maximum Daily Exposure (MDE) or, when this is not specified, the Maximum Potency per unit dose (data are from FDA inactive ingredients database).  A summary is presented in Table 1 below.

The most commonly used excipients are polyalcohol such as Glycerin and Sorbitol for which MDEs of 31536 mg (for solutions) and 45000 mg (for suspension) oral dosage forms) are reported, respectively.

For these ingredients (except for potassium sorbate) an acceptable daily intake (ADI) level has been specified which is the safest category possible.

Among other excipients the lowest MDEs are reported for Potassium Sorbate (120 mg) and Xanthan Gum (184 mg), while those related to Citric Acid and its tribasic salt (510 mg and 984 mg, respectively) are specified for Intravenous Injection only.

In addition to the information available on the level of excipients in oral dosage forms approved for human medicines and their MDE, a brief summary of the dosage or exposure level from literature or food additives and flavoring regulations is summarized below for each excipient since they are all also commonly used as food additives for the overall population including children and elderly.

## Glycerol

In a study [Peltola et al, 2007], oral administration of 85% glycerol given for 48 h at a dosage of 1.5 g (1.5 mL) per kg every 6 h in children aged from 2 months through 16 years was considered safe. The EFSA recently conducted a re-evaluation of glycerol (E 422) as a food additive; the Panel stated that glycerol has low acute toxicity and did not raise concern with regards to genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. The Panel conservatively considered the lowest oral dose of glycerol required for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

therapeutic effect to be 125 mg/kg bw (body weight) per hour and noted that infants and toddlers can be exposed to that dose by drinking less than the volume of one can (330 mL) of a flavoured drink. The Panel further concluded that the acute bolus exposure to glycerol by its use as a food additive should stay below doses at which pharmacological or side effects could occur and there is no need for a numerical ADI and no safety concern regarding the use of glycerol (E 422) as a food additive at the refined exposure assessment for the reported uses [EFSA, 2017]. The Panel estimated chronic exposure to glycerol (E 422) for the following population groups: infants; toddlers, children, adolescents, adults and the elderly, a summary is provided below.

In this assessment, mean exposure to glycerol ranged from 10 mg/kg bw per day in infants to 583 mg/kg bw per day in toddlers below the age of 3 years.

## Sorbitol

Although there is no maximum safe dose for sorbitol, it is suggested that the maximum daily intake should not exceed 20 g/day in adults [Rowe et al, 2006]. The reported side effects of sorbitol, especially when consumed in excessive amounts, in children include diarrhoea, colic and bloating [Jain et al, 1985]. Sorbitol is one of the most prevalent nutrients in fruit juice which often are recommended by paediatricians as a source of vitamin C and an extra source of water for healthy infants and young children [Pediatrics, 2001]. The recommended maximal intake of sorbitol in adults is 20 g/day. Using the weight of an ''average'' adult male (70 kg) as the denominator, the adult recommendations equate to 2 g of sorbitol/kg body weight/week [Whittaker et al, 2009]. However, it is recognized that over the threshold of 140 mg/kg/day (equivalent of 10 g/70 kg) it can cause laxative effects and gastrointestinal discomfort in adults and paediatric patients as stated in the relevant guideline on the Information in the package leaflet [EMA/CHMP/460886/2014].

## Xanthan gum

In 2017 EFSA performed a safety review on xanthan gum as a food additive. The Panel concluded that there is no need for a numerical ADI for xanthan gum (E 415) and no safety concern at the refined exposure assessment for the reported uses and use levels of xanthan gum as a food additive. It is reported that repeated oral intake by adults of large amounts of xanthan gum up to 15,000 mg/person per day, corresponding to 214 mg/kg bw per day for at least ten days was well tolerated. In several clinical studies, consumption of xanthan gum in infant formula or formula for special medical purposes in infant was well tolerated up to concentration of 1,500 mg/L (232 mg/kg bw per day).

## Potassium sorbate

Potassium sorbate is widely used as a chemical preservative and antibacterial in food, wines and personal-care products and due to its long history as a food additive with no apparent toxic effects, it recognized as GRAS [21 CFR 182.3640]. The maximal acceptable daily intake for human consumption was established to be 25 mg/kg [FAO, 2013]. The EFSA recently issued a scientific opinion reevaluating sorbic acid (E 200), potassium sorbate (E 202) and calcium sorbate (E 203) when used as food additives [EFSA, 2019]. The Panel was requested by the European Commission to carry out a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

scientific evaluation of an extended one-generation reproductive toxicity study (EOGRTS) to determine whether it would allow reconsideration of the temporary group acceptable daily intake (ADI) for sorbic acid (E 200) and potassium sorbate (E 202), established by the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS Panel) in 2015. From the EOGTRS, the FAF Panel identified a lower confidence limit of the benchmark dose (BMDL) of 1,110 mg sorbic acid/kg body weight (bw) per day. By applying a default uncertainty factor of 100, the Panel established a group ADI expressed as 11 mg sorbic acid/kg bw per day for sorbic acid (E 200) and its potassium salt (E 202).

## CitricAcidanditstribasicsalt

Citric acid is an intermediary substance in human metabolism, being engaged in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Citric acid also occurs in many foods, with the highest levels found in citrus fruits. Orange juice and lemon juice contain citric acid at levels of approximately 10 and 50 g/L, respectively. JECFA potassium and sodium salts (WHO 1974). The term ADI \"not limited\" is no longer used has the same meaning as the current term ADI \"not specified\",which is applicable to a food substance of very low toxicity for which the total dietary intake of the substance arising from its use at the levels necessary to achieve the desired effect and from its acceptable background levels infood,does not,in the opinion of JECFA, represent a hazard to health. Establishment of an ADI for citric acid expressed in numerical form was therefore not deemed necessary by JECFA.

They are used as an effective alkalinizing agent in several oral formulations (e.g Sodium Citrate and Citric Acid Oral Solution UsP) for systemic alkalization (e.g in chronic metabolic acidosis) or as buffering agent (to neutralize gastric hydrochloric acid). Usual paediatric dosage can range between 300 - 1500 mg twice a day.

## Estimated Intakeof ExcipientsforNetupitantPaediatric Oral Suspension

For cross comparison reasons, the Applicant has evaluated the individualexcipients intake in the NEPAreferenceforthisestimation.DataarepresentedinTable4below.

Overall the amounts of the excipients in the IMP formulations are all significantly well below the MDE levels established for approvedhuman medicines described inTable 1.

Their dosage levels appear all tobemuch lower than those levelsrecommended in literature, guidances or based on food additives and flavouring regulations.

Intake of potassium sorbate in these age groups is 1/200 the ADI, for xanthan gum and glycerin is less than 1/100 the Max ADI. For citric acid and its tribasic salt, amounts are less than 1/50 and 1/16 than the MDE. A paediatric patientwith an average bodyweight of 5 kg would be therefore exposed to 35.81 mg/kg of sorbitol corresponding to a dose of 180 mg; this dose level represents 1/4 of threshold of 140 mg/kg/day.

## Aqe groups for patients 3 months of age and older

As per study protocol, the patients belonging to age groups above 3 months of age (3 to&lt;6 months, 6 to &lt;12 months, 1 to &lt;2 years, 2 to &lt;5 years, 5 to &lt;12 years, and 12 to &lt;18 years) received the lower (    ) quantitative amount of excipients represents their max dosageintake.

The excipients estimate intake for these age groups is given in Table 6 below.

1Lower and higher 3rd centile of weight (www.cdc.gov./growthchart). Weight base intake per kg bw up to patients weighing kg 75. Patients ≥75 kg receive the same fixed dose as 75kg patients.

Intake of sorbate in these age groups is less than 1/1o0 the ADI, for xantam gum it is less than 1/9 the MDE and 1/750 the recommended Max ADI. Glycerin amount remain very low, 1/650 the Max ADI. For citric acid and its tribasic salt, intakes are less than 1/35 and 1/10 than the respective MDE. A paediatric patient with an average weight of 10 kg would be therefore exposed to 58.7 mg/kg of sorbitol corresponding to a dose of 587 mg: This dose level represents less than 1/2 of threshold of 140 mg/kg/day and is deemed safe considering that common pharmaceutical medicines given orally in children contains 1-2 g of sorbitol per dose with highest sorbitol dose levels in the range 400-500 mg/kg.

## SafetyReviewandRiskassessmentforexcipients

An evaluation of the excipients, their potential safety concerms and associated risk is presented in Table 7 below. Overall no risk has been identified in relation to the dose levels for Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid and its tribasic salt and Potassium Sorbate; their selection appear well justified considering the known safety concerns associatedwith excipientsofthe samefunctioncommonly used inpaediatric populations as well as documented in literature.

The most relevant AEs related to sorbitol and glycerol are pertaining to the gastrointestinal system. Therefore, a search in the clinical data base was run to identify treatment emergent adverse events in the SoC Gastrointestinal Disorders.

In total, 19 events occurred in 13 patients (see Listing in Appendix 1). With particular regard to patients below the age of 3 years, 6 events were reported in 3 patients. The events of nausea'(1), 'vomiting'(4) and'stomatitis'(1) were all considered not related to the study drugs netupitant and palonosetron.

Overall, no safety concerns were detected.

## Overall assessment and conclusion

The Applicant has evaluated the intake levels and the safety for all the excipients used in Netupitant Paediatric Oral Suspension for all age groups including their potential safety concerns and associated risk and those TAE of interest (SOC Gastrointestinal Disorders) in the paediatric patients below 3 years of age. No concerns arise from these assessments nor from the search in literature or guidances on their adequate use in paediatric oral formulations.

It should be noted that in comparison to other paediatric medicines, the dosage regimen for Netupitant Paediatric Oral Suspension is based on a single administration before each chemotherapy cycle to prevent CINV. The suspension is not intended for BID or TID regimen, or multiple days

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

administration such other medicines of the same class (ondansetron, emend) or commonly used in paediatry (antivirals, allergic rhinitis, epilepsy). Therefore, no risk can be associated to a multiple day administration as these medicines given daily, weekly or even longer period which would necessarily expose patients to excipients higher doses and their potential adverse effects. Even when the amount of the excipients is the same of another formulation for the same route this does not imply the level of risk would be the same. For sorbitol which is considered a potentially harmful excipient in the youngest children if it is given at high doses, data from databases related to approved drug products (dailymed, eMC, EMA) indicate that it is safely use being administered in all paediatric age groups (including neonates). From this search emerges over 70 products containing sorbitol at different dose levels, and a large number of medicines is approved for paediatric use.

A comparison of the dose levels in Netupitant Paediatric Oral Suspension versus well established oral paediatric approved products is given in Table 8 and Table 9.

Based on this comparison, we believe the dose level of sorbitol (as well as all the other excipients) in Netupitant Paediatric Oral Suspension single dose regimen can be safe for the overall paediatric population with no Hereditary Fructose Intolerance (HFI).

## Assessment of the response

While the comparison of the composition of netupitant versus other medicines licensed in Europe for use in the paediatric population is noted and understood, it is important to remember  that many medicines for use in this population were licensed prior to the introduction of the Paediatric Regulation 1901 of 2006, and as such there may not have been the same appreciation of the specific requirements for appropriate evidence supporting the licensing of age-appropriate formulations for the various age cohorts, nor the characterisation of the safety profile of the excipients used in those various products. As such, existing medicines for a specific age cohort containing a specific excipient is not in itselfinsufficient  justification,  and therefore can only be considered as supportive.

The applicant has detailed the function and amount of each excipient used in the netupitant formulation, and also has calculated the amount per Kg bodyweight which would be expected to be administered to children of typical bodyweight for the various paediatric age cohorts in which the product is intended to be used. They have also compared this amount to the amounts considered to be safe, as published in the various compendia, pharmacopoeias, and guidance documents which contain information related to the known or presumed safe Maximum Daily Exposure (MDE) level. For some of these, the only reference texts available relate to the amounts of the various excipients which are considered safe for use in foods, and while this is not ideal it can be accepted that this is the currently best available evidence supporting these reference values. As such, these can be accepted. It can be seen from the applicant's calculations that the amounts anticipated to be administered fall comfortably within these reference ranges. In addition, as the product is likely to be used as a single dose on different occasions generally separated in time, any risk of accumulation is likely to be low. While it might have been ideal for the applicant to clarify the known pharmacokinetics of the various excipients with a view to describing how these might differ in the various paediatric age cohorts, it is accepted on this occasion that the amounts being used and the dosing intervals allowed are such as to minimise any concerns from a clinical perspective. Justification of the safety of the proposed excipient levels based on the basis of available/calculated permitted daily exposures (PDEs) would be more preferable from a risk assessment perspective. Maximum daily exposure limits in other products will have been based on a benefit/risk assessment for that particular drug product and the patient population and indication. Nevertheless, based on the additional information and assessment provided by the MAH the proposed levels appeared justified.

Applicants should remain mindful of the advice contained within the guidance on the development of medicines for use in the paediatric population, which advises that a proper justification for the choice and amounts of all excipients used in a paediatric formulation should be presented, and that only those excipients which are essential to ensure the proper functioning and acceptability of the product should be included in the formulation. In general, a full characterisation of the safety aspects of those excipients in all relevant paediatric populations should be provided, taking into account the anticipated developmental and metabolic differences which exist at the various age cohorts, especially neonates and infants. It is also important for applicants to indicate any areas where information on this is either unavailable or uncertain. This allows a full assessment of the benefits and potential risks of the use of that formulation in the various paediatric age cohorts to be made. Applicants are reminded of the requirements set out in the Guideline on pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use (EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 Rev. 2), as well as the other relevant QWP guidelines.

Overall, despite the deficiencies in the response, the conclusions of the assessor is that the nature of the product and the levels of the excipients are such as to conclude that the benefit/risk profile of this product for this particular condition is positive.

## Question 2

The clarification by the applicant regarding the reason for the apparent differences between the PK profiles of the lower netupitant dose in younger children versus other groups is plausible and can be accepted. However, while it is accepted that inter-patient variability might have played a part in the apparently increased exposure of the two patients to the medicine, the levels of both Cmax and AUC seem significantly high as to wonder whether any dosing errors occurred in these patients.

The applicant is asked to confirm that the patients did indeed receive the correct dose, and if so comment on the reasons why the observed values were so beyond what might have been expected given the known degree of variability of netupitant.

## Summary of Applicant's Response

According to the information reported in the eCRFs of patients #101168 and #301141 of the 6 months to &lt; 12 months age class, dosing errors could be excluded.

Reasons that may explain higher netupitant exposure (C max  and AUC 0-inf ) in these patients may refer to the known inter-patient variability of netupitant pharmacokinetics and, possibly, to potential drug interactions with concomitant therapies.

The eCRFs indicate that before receiving the oral NEPA treatment, patients #101168 and #301141 were exposed to drugs characterized by strong CYP3A4 inhibition properties such as the antimycotic drugs fluconazole (#101168 only) and posaconazole (both #101168 and #301141). Treatment with fluconazole and posaconazole was terminated 11 days before NEPA administration, according to the study protocol. However, a possible residual drug interaction with fluconazole and posaconazole cannot be excluded. This might have contributed to explain higher netupitant exposure for patients #101168 and #301141, this latter in particular. The other two patients in the same age class, i.e., #302125 and #404150, who did not show increased netupitant C max  and AUC 0-inf , did not receive any concomitant medications that may have affected netupitant exposure.

Exposure data for netupitant metabolites M1, M2 and M3 appear to support this hypothesis. The table below shows that the AUC 0-inf  and C max  metabolite-to-netupitant ratios for patients #101168 and #301141 are remarkably lower than those estimated for the other two patients of the 6 months to &lt; 12 months age class, suggesting a reduced metabolism in these patients that may explain the higher exposure to the parent drug.

## Assessmentoftheresponse

The applicant has provided pharmacokinetic data for both patients showing a reduction in the metabolism of the parent compound into its metabolites, and suggests that this may be as a result of concomitantexposure to the strong CYP3A4 inhibitorsfluconazole and posaconazole.

Whilethisisapossibility,itisnotedbytheassessorthattheeliminationhalf-livesofbothsubstances is approximately 30h, which would mean that more than 8 half-lives would have elapsed if patients had indeed stopped taking these medicines prior to NEPA administration.As such,it mightbe expected that anyresidual inhibition ofthesemedicineswould havesufficientlywanedsoasnottohavehad an effectonthemetabolismofNEPA.

That being said, the assessor is satisfied that no overt errors occurred regarding the doses administered in the trial and that these specific results did not impact the overall results on the trial.
