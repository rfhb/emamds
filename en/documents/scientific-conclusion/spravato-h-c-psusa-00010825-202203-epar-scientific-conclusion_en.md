## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for esketamine (for centrally authorised product only), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on respiratory depression from spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive re-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between esketamine (for centrally authorised product only) and respiratory depression is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC Rapporteur concluded that the product information of products containing esketamine (for centrally authorised product only) should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for esketamine (for centrally authorised product only) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing esketamine (for centrally  authorised  product  only)  is  unchanged  subject  to  the  proposed  changes  to  the  product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
