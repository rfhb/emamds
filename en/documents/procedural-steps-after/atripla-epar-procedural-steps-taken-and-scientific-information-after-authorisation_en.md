Patients with predisposing factors such as severe hepatic impairment (CPT, Class C), or patients receiving concomitant medications known to induce lactic acidosis are at increased risk of experiencing severe lactic acidosis during tenofovir disoproxil treatment, including fatal outcomes. Co administration of Atripla and didanosine is not recommended. Increased systemic exposure to didanosine may increase didanosine related adverse reactions. Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported. Co administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated |

Concomitant administration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir with efavirenz, a component of Atripla, may significantly decrease plasma concentrations of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, leading to reduced therapeutic effect. Coadministration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir with Atripla is not recommended.

Study GS-US-342-1167 is a Phase I Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interactions between Sofosbuvir/GS-5815 Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) Tablets and Antiretrovirals Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (EFV/FTC/TDF; Atripla), Emtricitabine/Riplivirine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (FTC/RPV/TDF; Complera), Dolutegravir (DTG; Tivicay) o Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide Fumarate (EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF) in Healthy Subjects. The recommendation stemming from this study is that no dose |

adjustment of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with Eviplera orGenvoya is warranted upon co-administration, and that Atripla should not be co-administered with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.

Study GS-US-342-1326, a Phase I Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interaction Potential between Sofosbuvir/GS-5816 (SOF/GS-5816) Fixed-Dose Combination (FDC) Tablet and HIV Antiretroviral Regimens Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF), Ritonavir-boosted Darunavir (DRV/r) plus Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (FTC/TDF), Ritonavir-boosted Atazanavir (ATV/r) plus FTC/TDF, Ritonavir/boosted Lopinavir (LPV/r) plus FTC/TDF or Raltegravir plus FTC/TDF. Results showed that no dose adjustment is recommended.  The increased exposure of tenofovir could potentiate adverse reactions associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, including renal disorders.  Renal function should be closely monitored.

Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC in order to revise the HIV class label wording on mitochondrial dysfunction following the review of existing data on mitochondrial toxicity including the Mitochondrial Toxicity in Children (MITOC) Study.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data Medicinal product | 01/04/2016 | 16/12/2016 SmPC and PL no longer | Nucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most pronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these have predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine. The main adverse reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia). These events have often been transitory. Late onset neurological disorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether such neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown. These findings should be considered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, that present with severe clinical findings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings. These findings do not affect current national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission of HIV. |

No drug interaction data are available for concomitant administration of emtricitabine and simeprevir. However, based on the differential ADME profiles and the lack of in vitro interactions with CYPs and transporters, the theoretical risk of a drug-drug interaction between the emtricitabine component of Atripla and simeprevir is considered highly unlikely. Due to the observed interaction with efavirenz co-administration of simeprevir (Olysio) with Atripla is not recommended. SmPC and PL longer authorised   |

The main messages on renal safety are the following: to differentiate the monitoring depending on the presence of renal risk factors (reinforced monitoring) or not (standard monitoring); to consider interruption of treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in case of progressive decline of renal function when no other cause has been identified; to reflect the impact of the NSAIDs and boosted PIs in renal function and to inform prescribers that in some patients, renal function did not completely resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil fumarate discontinuation. |

The PL has been updated accordingly. Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity of this worksharing to update the PL with the details of the local representatives for Croatia and to introduce the Croatian language annexes for Emtriva and to update the bottle label to include the EDQM short standard term for the pharmaceutical form for Stribild. C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation   | no                    | longer      | published by the British HIV Association (BHIVA) in January 2013. As a consequence, the recommendations for post- exposure prophylaxis have also been changed in recently updated HIV treatment guidelines. For example, the 2013 BHIVA guideline does not generally recommend post- exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after exposure from a patient with well treated HIV. Based on these data, the wording on the risk of transmission for HIV products was revised to reflect the current scientific knowledge. While effective suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. authorised   |

| II/0075 | Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC with information on the drug-drug interaction with the HCV protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir and with additional information on the interaction with rifabutin. The PL is updated accordingly. In addition, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 9. The PL further is updated to include minor amendments for clarity. The MAH also took this opportunity to implement a minor linguistic correction in the DE annexes. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data product | 23/01/2014 | 22/01/2015 no | SmPC and PL | This procedure aimed to update section 4.5 of the SmPC to include information on the interaction of efavirenz with the HCV NS3 protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir and to complement information on the interaction with rifabutin. The drug-drug interaction information on concomitant use of efavirenz with either boceprevir or telaprevir was updated consistently with their respective SmPCs. Additionally, the SmPC was updated to inform prescribers that the recommended dose adjustments for rifabutin when coadministered with efavirenz have not been clinically evaluated. These updates for atripla (fixed-dose combination of efavirenz , emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) are in line with the approved SmPC for efavirenz (Sustiva/Stocrin). |

One child was reported to have a neural tube defect, and the frequency and pattern of other birth defects were similar to those seen in children exposed to non efavirenz containing regimens, as well as those in HIV negative controls. The incidence of neural tube defects in the general population ranges from 0.5 1 case per 1,000 live births. In retrospective reports, there have been six cases of findings consistent with neural tube defects including meningomyelocele, all in mothers exposed to efavirenz containing regimens in the first trimester. A causal relationship of these events to the use of efavirenz has not been established and the total number of pregnant women exposed to efavirenz-containing regimens is unknown.

| II/0029 | Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 and 4.8 of the SmPC to align the information with the efavirenz product information and to include tenofovir related safety information in accordance with the Company Core Data Sheet (CCDS) version 3 for Atripla. The PL was updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH took this opportunity to update contact details of local representatives in the PL. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 18/03/2010 product | 10/05/2010 no | SmPC and PL                      | The Product Information of Atripla was updated to reflect recent updates of the efavirenz interaction information, as well as any available new information on interactions with emtricitabine and tenofovir DF. Aiming at the harmonisation of the wording with the efavirenz product information the dose adjustment to 800 mg/day (i.e. additional 200 mg/day) of efavirenz when Atripla is co- administered with rifampicin has been amended to reflect that this dose adjustment may be considered rather than recommended. Also, a statement was included in section 4.4 of the Atripla SmPC on closer monitoring of renal function in patients who have previously experienced renal events while receiving adefovir dipivoxil, similar to that already included in the Viread (tenofovir DF) and Truvada (emtricitabine/tenofovir DF) SmPCs. During the review of cases of possible allergic reaction, a total of 14 reports that involved angioedema or possible symptoms of angioedema were identified in which there was some evidence of a potential causal association with tenofovir DF- or emtricitabine-containing products. As a causal relationship could not be excluded, this adverse side effect was added to the Atripla SmPC as well. longer |

| II/0008   | Update of section 4.5 of the SPC and section 2 of the PL with interaction with tacrolimus (study GS-US- 174-0105) and of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC with HIV-1 patients co-infected with HBV or HCV and resistance data from the 144 week analysis of study GS-01-934. These amendments align the Product Information for Atripla with its individual components, as agreed at the time of the initial Marketing Authorisation. In addition, minor linguistic changes were made in some of the EU version languages of the Annexes. 24/04/2008 Medicinal product | 18/06/2008   | SmPC and PL   | The lack of interaction observed between tacrolimus and the fixed-dose combination emtricitabine/tenofovir DF and the decreased exposure of tacrolimus levels expected when in co-administration with efavirenz are now reflected in the SPC of Atripla. Tacrolimus doses may require adjustment. Tacrolimus levels should be closely monitored at least two weeks of starting or stopping treatment with Atripla. The PL has been updated accordingly. The 144 week resistance analysis of study GS-01-934 (a randomised, open-label, parallel, active-controlled study designed to assess non-inferiority of tenofovir DF + emtricitabine + efavirenz relative to lamivudine/zidovudine |
