## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Suspension for injection (injection). Milky-white suspension.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Celldemic is indicated for active immunisation against H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus in adults and infants from 6 months of age and above.

Celldemic should be used in accordance with official recommendations.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

Adults and children from 6 months of age

Celldemic is administered intramuscularly as a course of 2 doses of 0.5 ml each. It is recommended to administer the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals ≥65 years of age.

## Paediatric population (infants aged &lt;6 months)

The safety and efficacy of Celldemic in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been established. No data are available.

## Booster dose

The need for a booster dose(s) following the primary vaccination schedule has not been established. Early waning of antibody levels has been observed, especially in adults (see section 5.1).

## Interchangeability

No data to support interchangeability of Celldemic with other H5 monovalent vaccines are available.

## Method of administration

Celldemic should be administered intramuscularly.

For individuals 12 months of age and over, the preferred injection site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm; for infants between 6 to less than 12 months of age, the preferred injection site is the anterolateral thigh.

The vaccine should not be injected intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.

The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.

For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4.

For instructions on handling and disposal, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to possible trace residues such as beta-propiolactone, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and polysorbate 80. History of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction after a previous dose of an influenza vaccine.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination.

## Anxiety-related reactions

Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. However, the presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

There is no immune correlate of protection established for influenza A (H5N1).

Based on humoral immune responses to the vaccine strain A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 after two doses of Celldemic, a protective immune response, as with any vaccine, may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients.

Some degree of cross-reactive immunity has been observed against H5N1 viruses of clades different to that of the vaccine strain and after a heterologous (H5N6) booster dose (see section 5.1). However, the degree of protection that may be elicited to strains of other subtypes or clades is unknown.

## Duration of protection

The duration of protection following the primary vaccination schedule is unknown.

A reduction of antibody titres was observed when assessed 6 and 12 months after the primary vaccination series.

## Immunocompromised individuals

The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine have not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The immune response of Celldemic may be lower in immunosuppressed individuals and may be insufficient to provide protection.

## Convulsions

While no postmarketing data are available from the use of Celldemic, cases of convulsion (with and without fever) were reported during the 2009 pandemic for H1N1 vaccines manufactured with the MF59 adjuvant, similarly used in Celldemic.

The majority of febrile convulsions occurred in paediatric subjects. Some cases were observed in subjects with a history of epilepsy. Particular attention should be given to subjects suffering from epilepsy and the physician should inform the vaccine recipients (or parents) about the possibility to experience convulsion. (see section 4.8).

## Excipients with known effect

## Sodium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Potassium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'potassium-free'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed. If Celldemic is given at the same time as another injectable vaccine(s), the vaccine(s) should always be administered to separate limbs. It should be noted that adverse reactions may be intensified.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are limited amount of data from the use of Celldemic in pregnant women.

Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, see section 5.3.

Healthcare providers need to assess the benefit and potential risks of administering the vaccine to pregnant women taking into consideration official recommendations.

## Breast-feeding

Celldemic has not been evaluated during breast-feeding. The vaccine is not expected to be excreted in human milk and no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated.

## Fertility

A reproductive and developmental toxicity study in female rabbits dosed with Celldemic revealed no impairment of fertility.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Celldemic has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the undesirable effects mentioned under section 4.8 may affect the ability to drive or operate machinery.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

## Adults 18 years of age and older

The most common local and systemic reactions reported in adults within 7 days following administration were injection site pain (51%), fatigue (22%), headache (20%), malaise (19%), myalgia (14%) and arthralgia (11%).

Severe reactions in subjects receiving aH5N1c were reported in 1% or fewer subjects for each reaction. Reactogenicity was higher after the first dose than after the second dose.

Data on the safety of a heterologous booster dose with aH5N6c were evaluated in Study V89\\_18E1 in which 258 subjects were vaccinated.  Among the study participants, 158 subjects had received aH5N1c in Study V89\\_18 approximately 6 years prior. The safety profile after one or two doses of aH5N6c heterologous booster was comparable to the safety profile observed in clinical studies with aH5N1c.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The frequencies of adverse reactions are based on three clinical studies in 3 579 subjects (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The adverse reactions are listed according to the following MedDRA frequency convention and system organ class: Very common (≥1/10); Common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10) ; U ncommon (≥1/1 000 to &lt;1/100) .

## Elderly population

Elderly individuals 65 years and older generally reported fewer solicited local and systemic reactions compared to younger adults.

## Paediatric population 6 months to less than 18 years of age

Clinical safety data for Celldemic in children 6 months to less than 18 years of age was collected in Study V89\\_11.

This was a phase 2, randomised, controlled, observer-blind multicentre study conducted in children 6 months to less than 18 years of age who received either two 0.5 mL (7.5 mcg HA of H5N1 with 0.25 mL MF59) or 0.25 mL (3.75 mcg HA of H5N1 with 0.125 mL MF59) doses of vaccine, 21 days apart.

In total, 658 subjects in the safety population received at least one dose (7.5 mcg dose, N=329; 3.75 mcg dose, N=329).

Solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were collected for 7 days after vaccination following each vaccination in all children, divided into two age cohorts (6 months to &lt;6 years, and 6 to &lt;18 years of age).

In both the 7.5 mcg and 3.75 mcg dose groups, the majority of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days. The frequency of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions was similar between the 7.5 mcg and 3.75 mcg doses.

The most common (≥10 %) solicited local and systemic reactions reported within 7 days following administration of Celldemic in children 6 months to less than 6 years of age were tenderness at the injection site (56%), irritability (30%), sleepiness (25%), change in eating habits (18%) and fever (16%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most common (≥10 %) solicited local and systemic reactions reported within 7 days following administration of Celldemic in children 6 to less than 18 years of age were injection site pain (68%), myalgia (30%), fatigue (27%), malaise (25%), headache (22%), loss of appetite (14%), nausea (13%), and arthralgia (13%).

Local and systemic adverse reactions reported in subjects who received either 7.5 mcg or 3.75 mcg doses of aH5N1c from Study V89\\_11 are shown below in Table 2.

The adverse reactions reported are listed according to the following MedDRA frequency convention and system organ class: Very common (≥1/10); Common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10) .

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, influenza vaccine, ATC Code: J07BB02.

## Mechanism of action

Celldemic provides active immunisation against the influenza virus strain contained in the vaccine. Celldemic induces humoral antibodies against H5 subtype influenza A viruses haemagglutinins. These antibodies neutralise influenza viruses. Specific levels of haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres post-vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine have not been correlated with protection from influenza virus, but the HI antibody titres have been used as a measure of vaccine efficacy. Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibody to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Celldemic contains the adjuvant MF59C.1 (MF59), which is designed to increase and broaden the antigen-specific immune response and to extend the duration of the immune response.

## Adults

Study V89\\_18 was a phase 3, randomised, observer-blind, multicentre, controlled study conducted in the United States in adults 18 years of age and older, who received either aH5N1c or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection placebo, 21 days apart. In total, 2 988 subjects (18 to &lt;65 years N=1 488; ≥65 years N=1 500) in the per protocol population received both doses of aH5N1c (N=2 249) or placebo (N=739). Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres against the A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (H5N1) strain were evaluated in sera obtained 21 days after the second dose.

HI titres were assessed according to prespecified criteria for the proportion of subjects with seroconversion (defined as a prevaccination HI titre &lt;1:10 and post -vaccination HI titre ≥1:40 or a prevaccination HI titre ≥1:10 and ≥4 -fold increase in HI titre) and the proportion of subjects with an HI titre ≥1:40. Assessment of the proportion of subjects with seroconversion or an HI titre ≥1:40 after vaccination was performed by age group (18 to &lt;65 years and ≥65 years). Success criteria required the lower bound of the 2sided 95% CI for the proportion of subjects with seroconversion, to be ≥40% for subjects 18 to less than 65 years, and ≥30% for subjects ≥65 years of age. For the proportion of subjects with an HI titre &gt;1:40, the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI was required to be ≥70% for subjects ≥18 to less than 65 years of age, and ≥60% for subjects ≥65 years of age.

In subjects 18 to less than 65 years of age and subjects ≥65 years of age, the prespecified criteria for proportion of subjects with seroconversion and an HI titre ≥1:40 were met 21 days after the second vaccination (Table 5). In Study V89\\_04 for adults 18 to less than 65 years of age, and Study V89\\_13 for adults 65 years of age and older, comparable immunogenicity results were observed.

b Seroconversion is defined as a prevaccination HI titre &lt;1:10 and post -vaccination HI titre ≥1:40 or a pre -vaccination HI titre ≥1:10 and ≥4 -fold increase in HI titre.

c  Geometric mean HI titres on Day 43 compared to Day 1

Bold shows that the prespecified criterion was met, ie, a lower bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval for seroconversion ≥40%, and for the proportion of subjects with HI antibody titres of ≥1:40 a lower bound of the 2 -sided 95% confidence interval ≥70% for subjects 18 to less than 65 years and ≥60% for subjects 65 years and older.

The MicroNeutralisation (MN) assay was used to measure immunological response against the homologous strain in a subset of 76 adults 18 to &lt;65 years of age in Study V89\\_18. Using the MN assay an at least 4-fold increase from baseline titres at Day 43 was achieved in 90% of subjects and a 24-fold increase in GMTs was achieved on Day 43 compared to Day 1.

A reduction of antibody titres was observed 6 months after the primary vaccination series, with GMRs of 1.53 [95% CI: 1.44, 1.61] in adults 18 to &lt;65 years of age and 0.97 [95% CI: 0.91, 1.02] in adults ≥65 years of age. Slightly higher but overall comparable GMRs we re observed at the 12-month time point of the phase 2 trials V89\\_04 (GMR 1.95 [95% CI: 1.73, 2.19] in adults 18 to &lt;65 years of age) and V89\\_13 (GMR 1.97 [97.5% CI: 1.76, 2.2] in adults ≥65 years of age). No data are available beyond 12 months.

## Cross reactivity data in adults

## Cross-reactive immune response elicited by A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (clade 2.2.1)

In the phase 2 studies, V89\\_04 and V89\\_13, immune responses were evaluated against five H5N1 heterologous strains: A/Anhui/1/2005 (clade 2.3.4); A/Egypt/N03072/2010 (clade 2.2.1); A/Hubei/1/2010 (clade 2.3.2); A/Indonesia/5/2005 (clade 2.1.3) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (clade 1) three weeks after the second vaccination. HI geometric mean titres (GMTs) on Day 43 compared to Day 1 increased between 2- and 7.3fold in subjects 18 to &lt;65 years of age (Study V89\\_04), and between 1.5- and 4.8fold in subjects ≥65 years of age (Study V89\\_13). The percentage of subjects with seroconversion or an HI titre ≥1:40 at Day 43 ranged from 28% to 64% in subjects 18 to &lt;65 ye ars of age and from 17% to 57% in subjects ≥65 years of age. Table 6 presents data on immune responses against the H5N1 heterologous strains.

c Geometric mean HI titres on Day 43 compared to Day 1

Using the MicroNeutralisation (MN) assay against the 5 heterologous strains, an at least 4-fold increase from baseline titres at Day 43 was achieved by 32 % to 88% of subjects 18 to &lt;65 years of age, and by 26% to 74% of subjects ≥65 years of age.

## Immune response after heterologous aH5N6c booster vaccination

Immunogenicity of a heterologous booster vaccination with aH5N6c in adults 18 years of age and older was assessed in Study V89\\_18E1. This was a randomised, observer-blind, multicentre study in which subjects who received 2 doses of Celldemic approximately 6 years prior in Study V89\\_18 (primed subjects), were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either two doses of aH5N6c vaccine containing 7.5 mcg HA of A/Guangdong/18SF020/2018 (H5N6, clade 2.3.4.4h) with MF59 adjuvant, 3 weeks apart or one dose of aH5N6c vaccine on Day 1 and saline placebo on Day 22. Subjects who had not received Celldemic were considered unprimed. Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres against the A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (clade 2.2.1) strain were evaluated in sera obtained 21 days after the second dose. HI titres on Day 43 compared to Day 1 increased between 30.8- and 31.7-fold in primed subjects, who received two doses of aH5N6c (Group 1) or one dose of aH5N6c and one dose of saline placebo (Group 2), respectively, and 2.1-fold in unprimed subjects. The percentage of subjects with seroconversion or an HI titre ≥1:40 at Day 43 ranged from 89.6% to 93.1% in primed subjects (Group 1 and 2) and from 13.4% to 20.0% in unprimed subjects. Table 7 presents data on immune responses against the H5N1 heterologous strain per group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Using the MicroNeutralisation (MN) assay 98.6% of subjects in Group 1, 95.7% of subjects in Group 2 and 11.8% of subjects in Group 3 achieved seroconversion against heterologous H5N1 strain at Day 43. The geometric mean fold increase (GMFI) was 51.7 in Group 1, 50.5 in Group 2 and 1.7 in Group 3.

## Paediatric population 6 months to less than 18 years of age

Immunogenicity data for aH5N1c in children 6 months to &lt;18 years of age was assessed in Study V89\\_11. This was a randomised, controlled, observer-blind multicentre study conducted in children 6 months to less than 18 years of age who received two doses of either 7.5 mcg HA of H5N1 with MF59 per 0.5 mL or 3.75 mcg HA of H5N1 with MF59 per 0.25 mL, 21 days apart.

In total, 577 subjects in the full analysis population received the 7.5 mcg dose (N=329) or 3.75 mcg dose (N=329). The subjects were divided into three age cohorts, 6 to &lt;36 months (N=177), 3 to &lt;9 years (N=193), and 9 to &lt;18 years (N=207) ; 53% of the subjects were male. 73% of the participants were Asian, 22% were White, 3% were Black or African American. HI antibody titres against the A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (H5N1) strain were evaluated in sera obtained 21 days after the second dose in three age cohorts (6 to &lt; 36 months, 3 to &lt; 9 years, and 9 to &lt; 18 years).

The proportion of subjects with seroconversion and an HI titre of ≥1:40 after vaccination was evaluated according to prespecified criteria. The success criteria for proportion of subjects with seroconversion were that the lower bound of the 2sided 97.5% CI should be ≥40% and for the proportion of subjects with an HI titre &gt;1:40, the lower bound of the 2-sided 97.5% CI should be ≥70% for all three age cohorts.

In all three age cohorts (6 to &lt; 36 months, 3 to &lt; 9 y ears, and 9 to &lt;18 years) the prespecified criteria for proportion of subjects with seroconversion and an HI titre ≥1:40 were met 21 days after the second vaccination with either the 7.5 mcg or 3.75 mcg dose. Table 8 presents data for the recommended dose.

The MicroNeutralisation (MN) assay was used to evaluate immunological response against the homologous strain (A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005) in subjects 6 months to &lt;18 years of age (N=69) who received the 7.5 mcg dose in study V89\\_11. Using the MN assay an at least 4-fold increase from baseline titres at Day 43 was achieved in 100% of subjects and a 257-fold increase in GMTs was achieved on Day 43 compared to Day 1.

A reduction of antibody titres was observed when assessed 12 months after the primary vaccination series (GMRs 7.5 mcg dose: 12 [97.5% CI: 8.76, 17]; 3.75 mcg dose: 5.62 [97.5% CI: 4.05, 7.81]), but the GMRs were still higher compared to the adult population. No data are available beyond 12 months.

## Cross reactivity data in the paediatric population 6 months to less than 18 years of age

## Cross-reactive immune response elicited by A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (clade 2.2.1)

In subjects 6 months to less than 18 years of age (Study V89\\_11), immune responses were evaluated against five H5N1 heterologous strains: A/Anhui/1/2005 (clade 2.3.4); A/Egypt/N03072/2010 (clade 2.2.1); A/Hubei/1/2010 (clade 2.3.2); A/Indonesia/5/2005 (clade 2.1.3) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (clade 1) three weeks after the second vaccination. HI GMTs on Day 43 increased between 8- and 40fold compared to Day 1. The percentage of subjects with seroconversion or an HI titre ≥1:40 at Day 43 ranged from 32% to 72% in subjects 6 months to &lt;18 years of age. Table 9 presents data on immune responses against the H5N1 heterologous strains.

Zoonotic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted, prepared in cell cultures)

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

1. What Celldemic is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you receive Celldemic
3. How Celldemic is given
4. Possible side effects

6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Celldemic is and what it is used for

Celldemic is a vaccine for use in adults and children aged 6 months and older, intended to be given in anticipation of, or during outbreaks of, zoonotic (this means it can spread from animals to humans) influenza viruses with pandemic potential, to prevent flu caused by H5N1 ('bird flu') viruses.

Zoonotic influenza viruses occasionally infect humans and can cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory infection (nose and throat infection) to influenza-like illness with rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock and even death. Human infections are primarily caused by contact with infected animals, but do not spread easily between people.

Celldemic is given before or during a H5N1 outbreak with pandemic potential. It contains some parts of the H5N1 virus, and the virus has first been inactivated so that it does not cause any disease. When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system recognises the virus parts in the vaccine as 'foreign' and makes antibodies against them. When the person comes into contact with the virus, these antibodies, together with other components of the immune system, will be able to kill the virus and help protect against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive Celldemic

## You should not receive Celldemic:

- -if you are allergic to
- the active ingredients or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6),
- beta-propiolactone, polysorbate 80 or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), which are trace residues from the manufacuring process.
- -if you have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to previous influenza vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving this vaccine.

## BEFORE receiving this vaccine

- Your doctor or nurse will make sure that appropriate medical treatment and supervision is readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction (a very severe allergic reaction with symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, dizziness, a weak and rapid pulse and skin rash) after Celldemic is given.
- You should tell your doctor or nurse if you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following an injection.
- You should tell your doctor or nurse if you have an acute illness which includes fever as a symptom. Your doctor may decide to delay your vaccination until your fever is gone. However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold.
- You should tell your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem, bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood-clots.
- You should tell your doctor or nurse if your immune system is impaired, or if you are having treatment that affects the immune system, e.g., with medicine against cancer (chemotherapy) or corticosteriod medicines (see section 'Other medicines and Celldemic).
- Your doctor should inform you about the posibility to experience convulsion, in particular if you have had previous history of epilepsy.

As with all vaccines, Celldemic may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated.

## Children aged less than 6 months of age

The vaccine is currently not recommended in children aged less than 6 months as safety and efficacy in this age group have not been established.

## Other medicines and Celldemic

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or nurse for advice before taking this vaccine. Your doctor needs to assess the benefits and potential risks of giving you the vaccine.

There is no experience of using Celldemic in breast-feeding women. Celldemic is not expected to pass into breast-milk and therefore no effects on breast-fed infants are anticipated.

## Driving and using machines

Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect the ability to drive and use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before driving and using machines.

## Celldemic contains sodium and potassium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'potassium-free'.

## 3. How Celldemic is given

Your doctor or nurse administers the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations.

Adults and children 6 months of age and older:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be injected into the upper arm (deltoid muscle) or upper thigh, depending on your age and muscle mass.

A second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, Celldemic can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

## Very serious side effects

Allergic reactions may occur following vaccination, and these may be severe. Tell your doctor immediately or go to the emergency department at your nearest hospital if you experience the following signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction:

- difficulty in breathing,
- dizziness,
- a weak and rapid pulse
- skin rash

If you experience these symptoms, you may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation.
