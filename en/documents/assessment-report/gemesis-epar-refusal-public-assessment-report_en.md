## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Periodontal  disease  is  a  chronic  inflammatory  condition,  resulting  from  long-term  bacterial  (plaque) accumulation on the surfaces of teeth, affecting the supporting tissues of the dentition. It is generally a progressive, destructive condition that leads to loss of bone and periodontal ligament, resulting in poor oral  and  systemic  health  and  compromised  dental  function.  Treatment  of  mild  forms  of  the  disease  is usually  accomplished  through  non-surgical  procedures.  Moderate  to  severe  disease  requires  surgical intervention  to  allow  thorough  removal  of  diseased  tissue  (defect  debridement)  and  incorporation  of techniques  designed  to  regenerate  the  periodontium.  The  most  common  periodontal  regenerative procedure is osseous grafting, which utilises autogenous, allogenic or alloplastic (synthetic) bone grafting materials  to  physically  fill  the  intrabony  defect  and  provide  the  scaffold  upon  which  cells  of  the periodontium are able to attach and deposit matrix, eventually leading to regeneration of the affected site.

Although the gold standard for regenerative grafting procedures is autogenous bone transplant (autograft), the  use  of  synthetic  grafting  materials  is  less  inconvenient  for  the  patient.  One  such  synthetic  material which has been shown to yield successful clinical results in the treatment of periodontal defects is betatricalcium  phosphate  ( β -TCP). β -TCP  is  a  porous,  biocompatible,  biodegradable  (resorbable)  sintered ceramic material, which has been used in a variety of bone grafting procedures in dental, maxillofacial and orthopaedic surgery for over 25 years.

Gemesis  was  developed  for  use  only  in  adult  patients  as  a  synthetic  grafting  system  for  bone  and periodontal regeneration in the treatment of periodontally related defects, including intrabony/infrabony periodontal defects and gingival recession associated with periodontal defects.

The product is a kit for implant that contains becaplermin (recombinant human platelet derived growth factor, rhPDGF also called rhPDGF-BB), as the active substance, presented as a sterile formulation in a syringe  at  a  concentration  of  0.3mg/ml  and  a  CE-Marked  bone  void  filler, β -tricalcium  phosphate  ( β -TCP). After combining the becaplermin medicinal component with the β -TCP medical device matrix, the mixture is implanted into the bone defect. Becaplermin is the same active substance as in the centrally authorised product Regranex.

The rationale for combining becaplermin and β -TCP is that in this combination:

- -β -TCP provides a mineralised bone-like scaffold which aids in preventing the collapse of soft tissues and promotes stabilisation of blood clots; this scaffold provides a framework for revascularisation and penetration by connective tissue cells that deposit bone matrix, leading to regeneration of the original defect;
- -becaplermin substitutes for PDGF (platelet derived growth factor) which is one of the body's main initiators of healing, whether the injury is in soft tissue (e.g. the gingiva) or hard tissue (e.g. bone). PDGF has  chemotactic  (i.e.  it  stimulates  directed  migration  of  cells)  and  mitogenic  (proliferative) properties. In addition, it stimulates osteoblast type I collagen synthesis, the predominant component of bone matrix as well as many types of connective-tissue cells including those of the periodontium, i.e. periodontal ligament (PDL) fibroblasts, cementoblasts, and osteoblasts.

Gemesis has been approved as a Class III combination product regulated as a medical device in the USA (PMA P040013, November 2005) and as a Class IV combination product regulated as a medical device in Canada (Device Licence No. 71464, May 2006). Gemesis is marketed as a medical device in the USA and Canada under the invented name GEM 21S. In view of its claimed properties, Gemesis is considered to fall within the definition of a medicinal product in the European Union and has to comply with the EU medicinal product legislation. Scientific Advice was not sought for the development of Gemesis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The marketing authorisation application dossier for Gemesis was submitted as a full application through the  centralised  procedure  falling  within  the  Article  3(1)  and  point  1  of  Annex  of  Regulation  (EC)  No 726/2004.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Gemesis  is  presented  in  the  form  of  a  kit  for  implantation.  It  consists  of  a  sterile  formulation  of  the i) active  substance,  becaplermin  (recombinant  human  platelet-derived  growth  factor  BB  homodimer) presented in a pre-filled syringe, at a concentration of 0.3mg/ml and ii) a CE-marked medical device: a pre-filled cup containing a bone-void filler, β -tricalcium phosphate ( β -TCP).

More specifically, the Gemesis kit contains the following components:

- -0.5 ml of becaplermin (0.3 mg/mL ) aseptically filled into a Hypak 1 ml borosilicate glass syringe with a butyl rubber stopper in a sealed aluminum tube with an inner lacquer. An application device is included to provide reproducible doses.
- -0.5 ml of synthetic β -TCP in granule form (nominal particle size 250 to 1000 µm) provided in a clear plastic polyethylene terephthalate-glycol (PETG) laminate cup heat-sealed with a pre-printed foil lid; the cup is terminally sterilised by gamma irradiation.

## Drug Substance

- Manufacture

## Manufacturing process

The active substance becaplermin is manufactured by two manufacturers in the U.S.A. in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). An inspection of these manufacturers was not deemed necessary for the purpose of the evaluation of the drug substance.

The  manufacturing  process  has  been  appropriately  described  and  documented.  The  in-process  controls used  to  monitor  the  production  process  are  considered  acceptable.  The  manufacturing  process  was appropriately validated (on the basis of 3 batches for fermentation/recovery and  3 batches for purification). Major concerns are however raised by the CHMP with respect to the occurrence of forms with reduced potency.

## Source materials used for the production of becaplermin

The  company  provided  appropriate  documentation  on  the  generation  of  the  host  yeast  strain,  the construction of the expression plasmids which followed standard genetic manipulation of yeast strains, the sources of the DNA components and the cloning strategy.

A  two-tier  cell  banking  system  is  in  place  for  the  production  of  becaplermin  in  accordance  with  EU guidelines.  An initial  Master  Cell  Bank  (MCB)  was prepared following transformation of S. cerevisiae with  the  expression  plasmid.  The  Working  Cell  Bank  (WCB)  was  prepared  from  a  thawed  vial  of  the MCB.  The  characterisation  tests  carried  out  on  the  MCB  and  WCB  are  in  accordance  with  current regulatory standards and results were satisfactory.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The genetic stability (structure and copy number) during storage of cell banks  and throughout and beyond normal production was confirmed with studies from three fermentations. Cells were harvested at the end of  three  fermentations  processes  and  tested  as  End  of  Production  Cells  for  purity,  phenotype  marker retention, plasmid copy number, plasmid structural integrity by restriction mapping and plasmid structural integrity by sequence analysis. The results showed that plasmid retention and copy number decreased over fermentation.  However,  the  decrease  was  not  substantial  and  does  not  affect  the  overall  yield  of becaplermin.  Post-production  cells  were  generated  from  the  End  of  Production  Cells  and  also  tested. Overall,  results  confirm  the  genetic  stability  of  cell  banks  and  during  production  and  support  the production fermentation limit  proposed by the company.

## Characterisation and impurities

Characterisation  studies  establish  that  each  molecule  of  the  becaplermin  dimer  is  a  homodimeric glycosylated  protein  consisting  of  antiparallel  polypeptide  chains  joined  by  two  interchain  disulphide bonds.  Each  monomer  also  contains  three  intra-chain  disulphide  bonds.  Reduction  of  the  inter-chain disulphide bonds results in loss of biological activity.

During  synthesis  and  purification  of  becaplermin,  a  number  of  post-translational  modifications  occur, which result in a complex mixture of molecules present in the drug substance.

Appropriate control of these drug substance related impurities is considered critical.

## · Specification

The  specifications  for  the  routine  testing  of  bulk  drug  substance  are  in  compliance  with  ICH  Q6B ('Specifications:  Test  procedures  and  acceptance  criteria  for  biotechnological/biological  products  CPMP/ICH/365/96').  Tests  include  identity  by  peptide  mapping,  protein  content,  bioburden,  purity, bacterial endotoxins, host cell protein, and total DNA.

Biological activity is measured using a mitogenic bioassay. The potency of becaplermin is determined by comparison to a qualified in-house reference standard and the results are expressed as percentage potency relative  to  the  standard.  The  qualified  reference  standard  is  calibrated  against  the  international  WHO international standard for PDGF-BB (94/728).

Except  for  the  test  and  specification  for  forms  with  reduced  potency,  analytical  procedures  were adequately justified, documented and validated and specifications are considered to be appropriate for the routine control of the bulk drug substance.

- Stability

The stability of the drug substance has been monitored in well controlled and justified stability studies under normal and accelerated storage conditions. Results from a sufficient number of commercial batches (12  commercial  batches)  support  the  claimed  shelf  life  under  the  proposed  storage  conditions.  The stability was also confirmed over several rounds (five) of freezing and thawing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Drug Product

Most of the information presented in the application pertain to production of the pre-filled becaplermin syringes with additional data on biocompatibility with the β -TCP matrix. Much of the data relating to the device component itself has already been assessed as part of the CE certification and therefore did not require evaluation by the CHMP.

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The active substance is formulated with appropriate compendial excipients (see table below) in a 1 ml borosilicate glass syringe.

- -with a butyl rubber stopper. An application device is included to provide reproducible doses.
- -0.5  cc  of  synthetic β -TCP  provided  in  a  clear  plastic  polyethylene  terephthalate-glycol  (PETG) laminate  cup  heat-sealed  with  a  pre-printed  foil  lid;  the  cup  is  terminally  sterilised  by  gamma irradiation.

## Composition of becaplermin solution

| Component                 | Function                  | Quality                      |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| rhPDGF-BB                 | Growth/chemotactic factor | Manufacturers specifications |
| Sodium acetate trihydrate | Buffer to pH 6.0          | Ph. Eur. 0411                |
| Hydrochloric acid         | pH adjustment             | Ph. Eur. 0003                |
| Sodium hydroxide          | pH adjustment             | Ph. Eur. 0677                |
| Water for injection       | Diluent                   | Ph. Eur. 0169                |

The  pre-filled  syringe  with  formulated  becaplermin  is  presented  together  with  a  medical  device: β -tricalcium  phosphate  ( β -TCP)  granules  contained  in  a  heat  sealed  laminate  cup  which  is  terminally sterilised  by  gamma  irradiation.  Both  the  becaplermin  and β -TCP  are  mixed  to  form  the  product administered to the patient.

The  medical  device  ( β -TCP  cup)  called  'GEMatrix'  is  certified  by  a  CE-certificate  (CE  number CE06.20400.01) issued by a European Notified Body (TNO Certification B.V.) on 16 May 2007.

According to the certificate:

- the device falls in the category of calcium phosphate bone void fillers for non-load bearing applications;

- the device consists of β -TCP ceramic granules (0.5cc +/- 5%) packed in a laminate cup, heat sealed using a PET/PE/Foil lid, and provided gamma sterile (min 25kGy).  The expiry date of 36 months when stored below 30°C has been approved.

The same device was used throughout product development including clinical and release studies and is the same as the device proposed for commercial use.

The company has performed studies to evaluate the compatibility of becaplermin with the β -TCP matrix once both components are mixed. The set of tests included purity, related substances, and a bioassay . Following assessment of test results, it is considered that the studies performed are not sufficient and that the compatibility of becaplermin with the β -TCP matrix has not been unequivocally demonstrated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Changes to the manufacturing process (manufacturing site transfer and scale-up) were introduced during development of the product and comparability data to demonstrate that changes did not affect the quality of the product were evaluated and considered insufficient. Although the comparability exercise confirmed compliance with specifications of lots before and after the manufacturing changes,  further investigation of the  occurrence  of  forms  with  reduced  potency  for  which  specifications  are  lacking  and  the  impact  on disulfide bridges is considered necessary to confirm that changes did not adversely impact on the quality of the commercial product.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The becaplermin pre-filled syringe is manufactured and controlled by a manufacturer in compliance with GMP and also tested by a second manufacturer.  The medical device ( β -TCP cup) is manufactured by another  manufacturer.  The  becaplermin  pre-filled  syringe  and  the  medical  device  are  assembled  and packaged by a manufacturer in compliance with GMP. Compliance with GMP for each site proposed for the sterilisation of the components of the final becaplermin syringe container closure system has not been demonstrated and evidence of satisfactory EU GMP inspections is required.

The method of manufacture of the becaplermin pre-filled syringe is a simple process consisting of thawing drug substance bulk, dilution in buffer, sterile filtration and aseptic fill into pre-sterilised syringes. This process is adequately described and documented and is controlled by adequate in-process controls.

Formulation and filling into syringes has been validated for three commercial scale batches. Maximum filled syringe holding time  has been validated. Batch analysis for a number of commercial size lots was provided  and  satisfactorily  demonstrates  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  lots conforming  to  the  defined  specifications.  Shipping  of  bulk  drug  substance  from  the  USA  to  the manufacturer in the UK has been validated and is acceptable.

Batches for the EU are released based on the final packaged Gemesis kit and not just on becaplermin prefilled  syringes.    The  proposed  batch  release  site  is  not  acceptable  for  the  batch  release  of  biological products.

## · Product Specification

Overall, the tests included in the drug product specifications are consistent with the tests included in the drug substance specifications and have been adequately validated. In addition to tests already performed on the drug substance and following evaluation, the company agreed to revise the specifications to include mass variance of filled units. Stability specifications have also been set, identifying appropriate stability indicating parameters. Specifications have only been partly justified. Of major concern is the inappropriate justification  in  terms  of  cross-reference  to  the  quality  of  the  material  used  in  clinical  trials  and  the inappropriate justification for not having a specification for forms with reduced potency at the level of the drug product.

## · Stability of the Product

Overall, the container closure system has been detailed and is of a suitable quality for the proposed use. Microbial  integrity  of  the  filled  container  closure  system  has  been  demonstrated  against  a  suitable challenge. The proposed shelf life of 36-month for becaplermin syringes when stored protected from light at  5+/-  3°C  is  supported  by  data  from  long-term  stability  studies  conducted  using  3  commercial-scale batches.    Under  accelerated  conditions,  the  drug  product  does  not  appear  to  be  very  stable  regarding impurities and related substances.  Data regarding purity are not provided for the early time-points before 12  months  and  so  it  is  difficult  to  assess  whether  the  product  will  be  stable  to  short-term  temperature excursions  (e.g.  during  transfer  from  the  formulation  and  filling  site  and  from  this  site  to  patients  via distributors).    The  company  provided  more  comprehensive  data,  from  accelerated  stability  studies  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

support  temperature  excursions.    Results  from  the  potency  assay  demonstrate  a  high  assay  variability, which the company committed to investigate and optimise. Calibration of becaplermin used in clinical trials  material  to  the  WHO  reference  standard  (e.g.  to  support  the  conversion  factor  applied)  has  been confirmed and the Applicant committed to report and label in I.U./mg.  Instructions regarding stability of becaplermin once mixed with β -TCP (i.e. maximum time before use) are included in the proposed product information. A concern with respect to a partition effect on product related impurities upon interaction with β -TCP is raised in relation to the occurrence of forms of reduced potency.

- Adventitious Agents

The  materials  of  biological  origin  used  in  the  manufacturing  process  of  Gemesis  are  from  animal  and vegetable  sources  and  have  been  sufficiently  documented.  These  materials  comply  with  the  Note  for Guidance  on  Minimising  the  Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform  Encephalopathy  Agents  via Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products (EMEA/410/01 Rev. 2).

The  TSE  risk  from  these  materials  is  negligible.  Viral  clearance/inactivation  studies  have  not  been presented for the drug substance and drug product. This is considered acceptable based on the risk of viral transmission from the materials of animal origin used in the manufacture of Gemesis which is considered low.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Although to some extent, the data submitted provide evidence with respect to the quality of Gemesis, there are major issues related to the quality aspects of the product and their potential impact on efficacy and safety.

## Comparability of the drug product

The company did not present convincing characterisation data to support the comparability of the drug product before and after the changes to the manufacturing process (i.e. change of site and scale) in relation to  those  forms  that  have  a  decreased  biological  activity.  The  method  used  for  retrospective  analysis  of released batches does not distinguish between forms. Nevertheless the company presented an extensive characterisation for the qualification of reference standards. This was the only study presented where the content  of  other  forms  were  performed  using  another  method  and  demonstrated  to  be  equivalent.  The follow-up  measure  proposed  by  the  company  to  analyse  the  previous  clinical  lots in terms  of quantification of other forms by this other method was noted but at present and in the absence of data, it can not be concluded that no significant changes on the quality attributes occurred between the clinical batches and the commercial product.

## Forms of reduced potency

The occurrence of high levels of forms with reduced bioactivity raises several concerns with respect to consistency of the quality of the product and its uniform clinical performance.

First, the company was not able to demonstrate that there is no partition effect on product related variants upon interaction with the β -TCP component. Results using the bioassay to quantify other forms and to demonstrate that there is no partition effect are not convincing given the wide variability of this bioassay and given that results are inconsistent with other results provided in the application. Therefore, a more direct  quantification  of  the  forms  is  required  to  unequivocally  demonstrate  that  no  partition  occurs favouring the presence of less potent forms.

Second, there are high levels of forms of reduced potency in the drug substance and drug product which are not appropriately controlled. The company proposed to tighten the limit of the specification for other

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

forms in drug substance lots based on the claimed positive outcome of non-clinical and clinical data. The proposed reduction does not constitute a significant reduction of the other forms and it is not validated in light  of  the  clinical  results.  Also,  the  possibility  that  the  forms  of  reduced  potency  may  also  be  a degradation  impurity  has  not  been  adequately  investigated  and  addressed.  Since  the  possible  partition effect cannot be ruled out, a significant reduction and adequate control of the other forms at the level of the drug product is important to ensure consistent product production and since these forms may have a detrimental impact on the uniform clinical performance of the product. It is possible that this will only be possible  by  making  significant  changes  such  as  including  additional  purification  steps  for  the  drug substance.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

All  toxicity  studies  presented  were  conducted  in  compliance  with  GLP.    Exceptions  to  strict  GLP compliance are the non-clinical  pharmacology studies.  These  studies  were  performed  under  procedures similar to GLP requirements. The testing facilities were accredited (AALAS) facilities.

## Pharmacology

The ability of rhPDGF-BB to activate all PDGF receptor combinations is considered key to its therapeutic utility by stimulating activities on cells that express either the α receptor, the β receptor, or both receptors. PDGF receptor binding and activation induces a number of cellular responses, including the stimulation of chemotaxis, mitosis and actin reorganisation, which are all critical events for appropriate tissue repair. The β -TCP component serves as an osteoconductive, resorbable bone void filler that prevents collapse of soft tissue and stabilises the blood clot.  As the β -TCP is resorbed, bone and other connective tissues grow into the  space  previously  occupied  by  the  matrix. β -TCP  is  a  porous,  biocompatible,  resorbable  sintered ceramic  material  with  a  calcium:phosphate  ratio  similar  to  that  of  the  hydroxyapatite  phase  of  natural bone.

Primary  Pharmacology  studies  include  one  dog  study  addressing  the  effects  of  Gemesis  in  periodontal defects  and  three  additional  non-clinical  studies  utilising  Gemesis  in  other  animal  models  (rabbit  tibial defect, dog carpus arthrodesis, and rat calvarial defect).

Secondary Pharmacology studies were not conducted, based on the presumption that Gemesis components will  be  confined  to  the  site  of  application,  and  on  the  low  amount  of  the  growth  factor  applied  as combined to β -TCP (0.15 mg).

- Primary pharmacodynamics

The following in vivo pharmacodynamic studies were performed:

1. In this study the rat calvarial defect model was used to evaluate the effect on bone regeneration of test articles  rhPDGF-BB (0.3 mg/mL and 1.0 mg/mL) and a control article (sodium acetate (NaAc) buffer) when used in conjunction with a β -TCP matrix and compared to an untreated surgical control group. A secondary purpose of the study was to assess the safety of these materials when implanted in the skull.

The  outcome  of  this  study  was  poor  and  failed  to  provide  the  intended  evidence  that β -TCP  would improve bone growth and would lead to defect healing. The potential role of rhPDGF-BB was therefore not shown.  No safety concerns were detected.

2. The study intended to evaluate the impact of rhPDGF-BB on remodelling in bone defects generated in a rabbit model. 30 New Zealand White rabbits were used. Unicortical, 5 mm osteotomies were created in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the proximal-medial tibial metaphyses of the animals. The animals were divided in three groups, treated with 1) β -TCP alone (control); 2) β -TCP containing 25 μ g  rhPDGF-BB (low concentration); 3) β -TCP containing 75 μ g rhPDGF-BB (high concentration).

5 animals/group were euthanised at four and eight weeks after surgery and evaluated histologically.

The clinical and histological evaluations revealed that the three treatment groups responded equally well to the experimental treatments. The potential role of rhPDGF-BB was therefore not shown. There were no signs of toxicity observed in any of the treated animals and none of the treatments appeared to interfere with the formation of new bone across the drill hole.

3. This study evaluated the effectiveness of rhPDGF-BB in a dog model of bone fusion which consisted on  the  production  of  a  partial  arthrodesis  of  the  radial  carpal/3rd  carpal  and  3rd  metacarpal  done bilaterally in 30 dogs. 10 animals/group received 1) matrix only (autograft, β -TCP, or β -TCP/collagen) in Side A, and 2) the same matrix + rhPDGF-BB (0.3 mg/mL) in Side B.

The study showed that the addition of rhPDGF-BB to any of the matrices appeared to improve bone fusion when compared to matrix alone, and that the combination of the synthetic matrices with rhPDGF-BB was at least equivalent to autograft alone. The bone that formed in the treated joints was normal and no signs of acute or chronic toxicity were observed.

4.  A  dog  periodontal  defect  model  was  used  to  assess  the  periodontal  regenerative  properties  of rhPDGF-BB (0.3 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL) in combination with β -TCP or DFDBA (demineralised freezedried  bone  allograft,  which  is  the  current  \"gold  standard\"  of  care  for  a  bone  grafting  material)  in  a randomised controlled way (study BMPI 2003-004). The non-clinical evidence for the effectiveness of Gemesis in a periodontal indication is derived from data generated in this beagle dog model of horizontal Class III furcation defects, which are critical-sized defects that would not otherwise heal.

60 defects were analysed in 15 animals. Clinical, radiographic and histomorphometric observations were performed in the animals at planned schedules. Treatment groups were analysed and biopsied at 8 weeks and at 16 weeks.

The selection of the rhPDGF-BB concentrations for this study was based on early experience in humans using rhPDGF-BB mixed with DFDBA for the treatment of periodontal defects, and biocompatibility data from tests conducted according to ISO 10993, where these concentrations were shown to be safe.

- (a) Groups 2 and 3 significantly greater than Groups 1, 4, and 7.
- (b) Groups 2 and 3 significantly greater (&lt;0.05) than Groups 4 and 7.
- (c) Groups 2 and 3 significantly less (p&lt;0.05) than Groups 4, 5, 6, and 7.

- (f) Group 6 significantly greater than Group 4.

Overall  the  outcome  was  better  when  rhPDGF  was  combined  with β -TCP  than  with  DFDBA (Demineralised freeze-dried bone allograft).

Incorporation  of  0.3  mg/ml  rhPDGF-BB  in β -TCP  showed  a  better  outcome  than  a  higher  dose  of  1 mg/ml,  evaluated  by  %  bone  fill,  connective  tissues,  void  and  CNAA  (complete  new  attachment apparatus). However the differences were not statistically significant. When compared to DFDBA alone, the 0.3 mg/ml and the 1 mg/ml rhPDGF-BB groups demonstrated trends for a positive dose-response even though the differences were only statistically significant for the increase in percent bone fill. The CHMP agreed with the Applicant that there may be no dose-response for rhPDGF-BB combined with β -TCP or with DFBA. However the CHMP pointed out that it could be that both doses (0.3 or 1mg/ml rhPDGF-BB) were  too  high  and  therefore  at  the  ceiling  of  the  dose-response  curve  or  that  the  high  variability  in response may mask any statistical significance. In conclusion, the information available does not give a nonclinical support for the clinical dose selection, considering that the minimum effective dose should be used for safety reasons but might not have been determined.

In  addition,  to  make  human  extrapolation  of  the  animal  results,  the  comparative  pharmacological interactions of recombinant human PDGF (rhPDGF) in animals, particularly in dogs but also in rabbits and  rats,  and  in  human  receptors  has  not  been  sufficiently  clarified  by  the  Applicant.    An  overview, prepared by the Applicant, of published studies showing comparative binding affinity of human PDGF

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(hPDGF) to the target receptors of different species commonly used in toxicology studies suggest that no major  binding  differences  of  hPDGF  across  species  exist.  Nevertheless  the  more  relevant  values  on comparative binding affinity of rhPDGF were not provided which reduces the value of the safety study results and again questions the basis for clinical dose selection.

Gemesis  is  implanted  in  patients  as  a  single  dose  containing  0.15  mg  rhPDGF-BB.    Gemesis  is  not administered systemically and does not require systemic transport for availability.  The applicant states that if the rhPDGF-BB component of Gemesis entered the circulatory system, in view of the short half-life of  rhPDGF-BB  and  the  small  quantity  of  rhPDGF-BB  delivered  with  the β -TCP  (0.15  mg),  the  drug substance  poses  limited  potential  for  systemic  exposure  or  distribution  to  other  organs  or  tissues. Consequently, no secondary pharmacology studies were conducted. This was deemed acceptable by the CHMP.

## · Safety pharmacology programme

There were no adverse pharmacodynamic or pathophysiological effects observed in toxicology testing or in the clinical studies for Gemesis.  Therefore, safety pharmacology studies were not warranted. This was deemed acceptable by the CHMP.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

PDGF is a naturally occurring protein that is released from platelets at the site of an injury.  As Gemesis is not administered systemically but is delivered locally, and is implanted in a single dose containing 0.15 mg rhPDGF-BB, the nonclinical programme did not include testing of rhPDGF-BB for drug interactions. This was deemed acceptable by the CHMP.

## Pharmacokinetics

Classical ADME studies with Gemesis were not performed due to the fact that the product is mostly to be given for local single administration at a very low quantity (although repeated administration cannot be completely excluded). Even if rhPDGF-BB is reabsorbed from a local site of administration and reaches the  systemic  circulation,  the  amount  to  be  distributed  through  tissues,  then  metabolised  and  eliminated might  be  low.  Instead,  Gemesis  product  was  investigated  with  respect  to  the  binding  and  subsequent release of biologically active rhPDGF BB from candidate bone substitute materials. The in vitro and in vivo studies determined characteristics of the rhPDGF BB/ β -TCP interaction, and compared the release of rhPDGF-BB  from  different β -TCP  matrix  materials  that  might  be  used  in  dental  surgery.  Under procedures  mimicking  the  proposed  use  of  Gemesis  in  surgery,  release  of  rhPDGF  BB  from  various matrix  materials  was  demonstrated  to be  equivalent.    In  addition,  the  availability  of  biologically  active rhPDGF BB released from the various β -TCP matrices, and Gemesis in particular, was established and shown to be high during the first 30-60 min up to 72h after which around 90% of the protein was released. The  remaining  was  seen  to  be  slowly  released  up  to  7  days.  The  release  of  rhPDGF  from  the  site  of application, and its subsequent disposition was discussed by the Applicant, and seems to be rapid, with distribution  through  several  organs  including  thyroid,  intestinal  tract,  and  elimination  in  the  faeces  and urine  (information  from  radioactivity  evaluation).  Therefore,  there  is  a  potential  for  organ  exposure  to rhPDGF which, though low or negligible after a single administration may be higher in case of multiple sites of application or repeated application.

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

Five single dose toxicity studies have been conducted in mice.  Three of these studies investigated the acute systemic toxicity of rhPDGF-BB when combined with β -TCP from three different sources and the other two studies investigated the effect of aged rhPDGF-BB (without β -TCP). Extracts of the saturated matrix were used. The studies are more like quality 'biocontrol' rather than a true acute toxicity test. No relevant toxicities were identified.

## · Repeated dose toxicity

Only one rat repeated dose toxicity study is included in the file, which addressed the bone response to intramuscular injections of rhPDGF-BB for 2 and 8 Weeks. This in vivo study reassessed a previous study performed on rhPDGF-BB (Knight et al., 1998) except that this study examined longer term (8 week) effects.  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the test substance, rhPDGF-BB, for its short and long term effects on muscle and bone tissues when injected multiple times in rats.

The Applicant's conclusion on this rat study was that rhPDGF-BB can be considered mildly reactive at a dose  of  100 µg/mL  in  both  soft  tissue  and  skeletal  tissue  when  injected  in  close  proximity  to  skeletal tissues at volumes of 0.1 mL every other day for 2 weeks. This reaction was transient and was not present in either the soft tissue nor the skeletal tissue 6 weeks post final dose. These effects may be expected from the  mechanism  of  action  of  rhPDGF-BB.  Nevertheless,  they  were  seen  with  10  µg  dose  (0.1  mL  of 100 µg/mL solution), which is more than 10 times less than the human dose proposed (150 µg single site dose). Although there might be a potential for increased (neighbouring) tissue reactivity in case of leakage of rhPDGF-BB from the site of application, it is acknowledged that the local reactivity by subcutaneous application could be higher as compared to a slower access of the molecule into neighbouring tissues, in particular the gingiva, the effect being difficult to differentiate from any reaction to the surgical process per se. rhPDGF-BB has not shown an effect in rat calvaria defect model, however, the model has been explained  as  appropriate  to  address  the  potential  leakage  of  rhPDGF  from  the  application  site,  but  not appropriate to address efficacy. Given the uncertainty regarding the comparative pharmacological activity of rhPDGF in human and rodent species, it could not be clarified whether the rat reactivity pattern can be considered as a predictor for human tissue reactivity.

- Genotoxicity

Despite  the  fact  that  the  rh-PDGF  component  of  Gemesis  might  not  need  to  be  tested  for  mutagenic potential, since it is a recombinant human (biotechnology) protein, in vitro bacterial gene mutation assays were performed with extracts from β -TCP saturated with the rhPDGF-BB. The genotoxic concern (if any) could therefore be more derived from any (contaminating) component of the β -TCP matrix. All studies were  negative.  The  concentration  of  rhPDGF  used  in  these  studies  was  lower  than  that  to  be  used clinically, which questions the value of the study performed, since this may reflect also that the levels of matrix components reached in the extracts tested were insufficient for any potential to be detected. The Applicant has calculated that the concentration of rhPDGF at the site of application after one hour could be around 3.3 times lower than that in the test compound. Even if this would reflect the concentration of the  matrix  components  also,  such  ratio  is  still  insufficient.  Immediately  after  application  the  local concentration could have been at the level of that in the test compound. A repetition of the genotoxicity study would have been necessary to clarify this point.

- Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted with Gemesis. This is justified on the basis of the intended single  application,  with  anticipated  limited  exposure  duration  and  extension,  since  rhPDGF-BB  will  be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

expected to be metabolised as any other protein and, even if distributed systemically, it would be of very low concentration and of short duration. Based on its activity as growth factor, only a persistent activation of  receptors  might  be  considered  as  a  concern.  Therefore,  it  was  agreed  with  the  Applicant  that carcinogenicity  studies  were  not  warranted  for  the  currently  applied  indication  and  short  exposure duration.  Gemesis is proposed to be contraindicated in patients with tumours. However, Gemesis could be used  several  times  when  several  dental  interventions  are  performed  and  therefore  exposure  may  be extended into several multiples. In this perspective the labelling needs to reflect a concern for potential tumorigenesis.

## · Reproductive toxicity

Reproductive toxicity studies were not conducted. The Applicant proposes that an effect of rhPDGF-BB on the bone foetal growth cannot be excluded. However, no studies to address the systemic distribution of the protein from the application site have been performed nor planned. The only study which has been conducted and might be meaningful with regard to this question is the proof of concept study performed in dogs. In at least one animal study blood sampling has been performed and preserved. Whether analysing the samples (if available) would be possible and meaningful has not been considered. The Applicant was requested to revisit this study and/or any others available in the literature where the systemic distribution of  rhPDGF  after  periodontal  application  might  have  been  evaluated.  It  has  been  concluded  that  the persistence  at  the  site  of  application  is  short  lasting  and  there  is  distribution  through  several  organs followed  by  urinary  and  faecal  elimination.  Therefore  transplacental  passage  and  foetal  exposure  to rhPDGF cannot be excluded and this should be reflected in the labelling, excluding pregnant women from treatment. This is also important for labelling with respect to fertile women.

## · Cytotoxicity

Assessments of potential cytotoxicity rhPDGF-BB + β -TCP (of different origins) was performed in mouse fibroblast  cultures  exposed  to  extracts  of  the    rhPDGF-BB  + β -TCP  mixtures, β -TCP  of  the  different origins also being tested in other studies.  Neither test result showed cell lysis, indicating no evidence of cytotoxicity.

## · Toxicokinetic data

No studies were performed but the CHMP requested calculations of the safety margins for the various safety data submitted in support of the approval of Gemesis. In a study to evaluate systemic toxicity, mice received  a  dose  that  exceeded  the  maximum  human  clinical  dose  (2.1 μ g/kg  body  weight)  by approximately  2,381-fold.    No  acute  toxic  outcomes  were  observed  in  the  mice  over  a  7  day  period following dosing in any of the studies conducted.

In a rabbit intramuscular implantation study of rhPDGF-BB combined with β -TCP the dose administered to rabbits exceeded the maximum human dose by approximately 24-fold.  The Gemesis test article in these studies  was  evaluated  histopathologically  and  found  to  be  a  slight  irritant  in  comparison  to  controls  4 weeks after implantation.

A second rabbit study where aged rhPDGF-BB was injected intracutaneously and paravertebrally in five locations at a dose exceeding the maximum human clinical dose for Gemesis of approximately 36-fold the test substance was found non-irritant.

The CHMP acknowledged the further discussions of the Applicant on the calculation of 'safety margins' for the rhPDGF used in the toxicity studies. The calculations however did not take into consideration the binding of rhPDGF to animal and human receptors, which might be acceptable in case no major difference exists.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Other toxicity studies

Other  studies  conducted  with  Gemesis  were  irritancy,  dermal  sensitisation.  As  an  added  measure, rhPDGF-BB  preparations  stored  for  a  minimum  of  12  months  at  5 ° C  or  30 ° C  were  subjected  to  an abbreviated test panel to demonstrate there would be no new toxicity associated with use of rhPDGF-BB that might have been exposed to non-standard storage conditions.  Also, intracutaneous irritation studies in rabbits have shown that VitOS, the matrix in Gemesis is of grade 2 potential, which was referred as not relevant. Since clinical information is available, this aspect will be better clarified from this information rather than from non-clinical data. Cytotoxicity studies using mouse fibroblasts also showed no evidence of toxic effects associated with aged rhPDGF-BB.

A number of standard non-clinical studies have not been performed with the Gemesis product, including pharmacokinetics/toxicokinetics, single-dose toxicity in a non-rodent species, and reproductive toxicology.  Such assessments are not warranted for this product, based on the rationale that PDGF-BB is a naturally occurring protein, with a short half life, that is applied locally.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

According to the CHMP Guideline on Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) 'Vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment'. Therefore Gemesis is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

Due to the fact that Gemesis is administered locally and implanted in a single dose containing 0.15 mg rhPDGF, a naturally occurring protein, the non-clinical program was abridged. The most relevant study for the human indication to treat periodontally related defects came from a dog periodontal defect model and gave only moderate evidence of efficacy. The lower dose of 0.3mg/ml rhPDGF appeared to be more effective than the higher dose of 1mg/ml, even though these differences were not statistically significant. Concerns were raised that both doses were too high and therefore at the ceiling of the dose-response curve or  that  the  high  variability  in  response  may  mask  any  statistical  significance.  Consequently  the information presented did not give a non-clinical support for the clinical dose selection, considering that the minimum effective dose should be used for safety reasons but might not have been determined. Furthermore, no studies were performed by the Applicant to study the affinity and interaction pattern of rhPDGF  to  the  human  receptors  as  compared  to  non-recombinant  human  PDGF,  and  to  the  target receptors in the species commonly used for pharmacology and toxicology studies. This reduces the value of the results of the safety studies performed and again questions the basis for clinical dose selection. The application  of  rhPDGF  will  be  local,  but  a  leakage  from  the  site  of  application  into  periodontal  tissue, namely  the  gingiva  might  be  possible  and  the  consequence  is  not  clearly  defined.  Given  the  clinical experience with the matrix scaffold, no additional studies were requested.   However, several concerns related  to  the  safety  of  the  rhPDGF  were  not  sufficiently  clarified  by  the  Applicant.  Overall  the  nonclinical dossier for Gemesis is only of moderate quality and the rationale for the inclusion of becaplermin (recombinant human platelet derived growth factor, rhPDGF) into the β -TCP scaffold was not strongly supported by the non-clinical program.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the Applicant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

No clinical data have been provided and this is partly justified. The Applicant failed to provide data on the amount  of  becaplermin  bound  to  the  matrix  after  both  components  are  mixed,  information  on  the resorption  of  the  matrix  over  time,  and  data  supporting  that  becaplermin  is  largely  unavailable systemically.

No  interaction  studies  have  been  performed.    However,  postoperative  care  includes  analgesic  and antibiotic  treatment,  and  later,  an  antibacterial  mouthwash  such  as  chlorhexidine  is  usually  prescribed. Relevant data from the clinical trial should have been used.

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Mechanism of action

The Applicant claims that  becaplermin  promotes  the  chemotactic  recruitment  and  proliferation  of  cells involved  in  wound  repair,  thus  promoting  the  growth  of  normal  tissue  for  healing.  The  development program included in vitro and in vivo animal studies in order to demonstrate its potent (proliferative) and chemotactic  (directed  cell  migration)  effects  on  bone  and  periodontal  ligament  derived  cells. β -TCP is frequently used as an osteoconductive synthetic bone substitute for numerous bone void applications. β -TCP provides  a  mineralized  bone  like  scaffold  for  efficient  penetration  by  connective  tissue  cells  and subsequent stimulation of new bone.

## · Primary and Secondary pharmacology

No clinical data have been submitted.  The Applicant has provided a number of published references for in vitro experiments using animal and human cells including mainly PDL and gingival fibroblasts as well as osteoblasts.  Other references relate to in vivo experiments in animal models using the rat, dog, miniature pig, and monkey.  A significant number of these publications describe the results of the combination of growth factors, namely PDGF with IGF-I or TGF-1 β .

## Clinical efficacy

Gemesis is intended for bone and periodontal regeneration in adult patients. The clinical development plan for the efficacy of Gemesis in the treatment of periodontally related defects (including intrabony/infrabony periodontal  defects  and  gingival  recession  associated  with  periodontal  defects)  includes  only  one randomised, double blind, controlled, multicenter pivotal study (BMPI-2001-01). This study is summarised  in  the  table  below.  Furthermore,  the  Applicant  provided  three  publications  as  'proof  of concept' studies, none of which are on the combination of rhPDGF-BB and β -TCP.

## · Dose response study(ies)

There are no specific dose-finding studies. The rhPDGF-BB concentrations for the provided clinical study were  selected  based  upon  previous  clinical  and  non-clinical  experience  from  different  investigation groups. The clinical studies referred by the Applicant can be summarised as follows:

- -Howell et al . (1997)

The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety of growth factors when applied to periodontal osseous defects in humans; a second objective was to investigate the therapeutic doses  required  to  stimulate  periodontal  regeneration.    Thirty  eight  patients  with  bilateral osseous  periodontal  lesions  were  assigned  to  one  of  two  treatment  groups  in  a  split-mouth design:  either  a  low  dose  ( 0.05 mg/mL  each of  rhPDGF-BB  and  rhIGF-I)  or  a  high  dose ( 0.15 mg/mL  each of  rhPDGF-BB  and  rh-IGF-I)  in  a  gel  vehicle.    The  control  side  was treated  with  periodontal  flap  surgery  or  surgery  plus  vehicle.    Safety  analyses  included physical examination, haematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, antibody titres, and radiographic  evaluation  of  bony  changes.    The  primary  efficacy  assessment  was  bone  fill measured by surgical re-entry at 6 to 9 months.

No local or systemic issues were found, and no patients developed antibodies.  Statistically significant increases in alveolar bone formation were noted for the high dose (p&lt;0.05) at 9 months  when  compared  to  controls;  this  corresponded  to  an  increase  of  2.08  mm  of  new vertical bone height vs. 0.75 mm in the controls.  No difference was seen at the low dose.

- -Camelo et al. (2003)

The  clinical  and  histological  response  to  rhPDGF-BB  delivered  with  demineralised  freezedried bone allograft was evaluated in four advanced Class II furcation defects.  rhPDGF-BB was applied  on  the  root  surfaces  and  saturated  the  bone  allograft;  two  concentrations  were used  (0.5 mg/mL  and  1.0 mg/mL,  two  cases  each).    Clinical  probing  depth  and  attachment levels  were  obtained  pre-surgically  and  9  months  post-surgical,  after  which  the  teeth  and surrounding tissues were removed en bloc.

Both concentrations of rhPDGF-BB resulted in substantially improved horizontal (mean 3.5 mm) and vertical (mean 4.25 mm) probing depths and clinical attachment levels (CAL; mean 3.75  mm).    Histological  evaluation  revealed  periodontal  regeneration,  including  new  bone, cementum, and periodontal ligament coronal to the reference notch.

## -Nevins et al. (2003)

The regenerative effects  of  rhPDGF-BB incorporated in bone allograft  for  the  treatment  of interproximal intrabony and/or Class II furcation defects were evaluated in 9 adult patients (11 sites) with advanced periodontitis.  The same methodology as in the previous trial was used; three concentrations of rhPDGF-BB were tested (0.5, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/mL).  Four other sites were treated with an organic bovine bone (ABB).  Clinical and radiographic data were analysed  for  change  from  baseline  by  defect  type  and  rhPDGF-BB  concentration.    The histologic  specimens  were  analysed  for  the  presence  of  regeneration  of  a  complete  new attachment apparatus coronal to the reference notch.

Interproximal  defects  treated  with  rhPDGF-BB/DFDBA (n=6)  had a  mean  vertical  probing depth (vPD) reduction of 6.42 and a mean CAL gain of 6.17 mm.  Mean radiographic bone fill was 2.14 mm.  Furcation defects treated with rhPDGF-BB/DFDBA (n=5) exhibited mean horizontal and vertical PD reduction of 3.40 and 4.00 mm, respectively, and a mean CAL gain

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of  3.2  mm.    Histological  evaluation  revealed  regeneration  of  a  complete  periodontal attachment apparatus, including new cementum, PDL, and bone coronal to the root notch in 4/6 interproximal and 4/4 furcation defects (1 not determined).  In contrast, 2/4 defects treated with ABB demonstrated regeneration.  No significant differences between the concentrations of rhPDGF were shown.

## Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The  last  two  studies  provide  the  only  histological  data  available  with  rhPDGF-BB,  and  they  report periodontal regeneration.  However, the data on dose selection are highly insufficient because the human data refer to different application conditions as rhPDGF-BB was used alone or with demineralised freezedried  bone  allograft  which  is  able  by  itself  to  induce  periodontal  regeneration.    Furthermore,  no differences  were  seen  between  the  various  concentrations  (0.5  to  5.0  mg/mL).    Finally,  no  histological data are available for the combination with the β -TCP matrix used in Gemesis. Nevertheless they were used  to  guide  the  dose  selection  on  the  pivotal  clinical  study  that  included  1.0 mg/mL  and  0.3 mg/mL rhPDGF-BB administration.

- Main study

The only pivotal trial performed was a double-blind, randomised, parallel group trial conducted in 11 US centres (Study Number BMPI-2001-01) which was monitored by a CRO.

## METHODS

## Study Participants

180 patients were enrolled and allocated to three different groups.

The mean age for the groups was 49.4, 50.4 and 52.8 years in Groups I, III and III, respectively; 20%, 31% and 20% of patients per group were smokers.

Demographic data for the 180 patient intent-to-treat population is provided in the table below:

The main inclusion criteria of study BMPI-2001-01 were:

- 25-75 year old patient with advanced periodontal disease
- at least 1 site requiring surgical intervention to correct a bone defect
- pocket depth at least 7 mm at baseline
- after surgical debridement, 4 mm or greater vertical bone defect with at least 1 bony wall
- sufficient keratinised tissue to allow complete coverage of the defect
- radiographic base of defect at least 3 mm coronal to the tooth apex.

All groups were balanced for standard demographics and smoking history.

## Treatments

Patients were randomly allocated to one of the following treatment groups:

- GROUP I: Gemesis , with sodium acetate buffer containing 0.3 mg/mL rhPDGF-BB;
- GROUP II : Gemesis, with sodium acetate buffer containing 1.0 mg/mL rhPDGF-BB;
- GROUP III: β -TCP with sodium acetate buffer alone (control).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sterile β -TCP  was  provided  in  granular  form  (0.25  mL)  and  stored  in  glass  vials.    The  test  solution, approximately 0.25 mL sodium acetate buffer (alone, containing 0.3 mg/mL rhPDGF-BB or 1.0 mg/mL rhPDGF-BB) was provided in syringes.

The doses were selected on the basis of the proof of concept studies previously described and two dog studies, which used a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL.

## Objective

The objective  of  the  study  was  to  demonstrate  that  Gemesis  promotes  greater  periodontal  regeneration than an osteoconductive scaffold alone ( β -TCP) and historical controls.

## Endpoints

Primary endpoint:

- Change in clinical attachment level (CAL) between baseline and 24 weeks post-surgery comparing Group I vs. Group III.

CAL was defined as \"the distance from the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) or other fixed reference point, generally along the long axis of the tooth to the deepest extent of the periodontal pocket\".

Secondary endpoints:

- CAL change between baseline and 24 weeks post-surgery (Group II vs. Group III).
- Change in  pocket  depth  reduction  (PDR)  between  baseline  and  24  weeks  with  PD  defined  as  the distance from the gingival margin generally along the long axis of the tooth to the deepest extent of the periodontal pocket (Group I and II vs. Group III).
- Change in gingival recession (GR) between baseline and 24 weeks with GR defined as the distance from the free gingival margin (FGM) to the CEJ (Group I and II vs. Group III).
- Wound healing (WH) during the first three weeks post-surgery. The scale ranged from 0 (absence of inflammation) to 4 (severe inflammation) (Group I and II vs. Group III).
- Radiographic assessment of linear bone growth (LBG) and % bone fill (%BF) from baseline to 24 weeks post-surgery; LBG was defined as the improvement in bone height.
- Area under the curve (AUC) of CAL change using 12- and 24-week time points (Group I and II vs. Group III).

Composite endpoint used for the post-hoc analysis:

- CAL change ≥ 2.7 mm and an LBG ≥ 1.1 mm at 24 weeks or CAL change ≥ 2.7 mm and a %BF ≥ 14.1 % (Group I and II vs. Group III).

All  investigators  had  to  have  experience  in  periodontal  regenerative  procedures  and  were  successfully calibrated prior to enrolment and during the follow-up period, ensuring the consistency and accuracy of the probing measurement technique. The CHMP regarded the proposed endpoints as adequate and in line with the recent literature.

## Sample size

A total of 180 patients were randomly allocated to three groups (I, II and III).

The estimated sample size was calculated using CAL and relied on the normal deviate distributions for a one-sided t-test comparing  two  groups of independent and randomly  allocated subjects. Each

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

participating individual contributed one osseous defect to the trial.  The number of subjects needed per treatment group was calculated using the following assumptions:

- -alpha = 0.05 (one-sided)
- -beta = 0.20 (80% power)
- -standard deviation (SD) of CAL change = 2.0 mm
- -minimum detectable difference in CAL = 1.0 mm.

For the present study, in which the bulk of the changes in CAL measurements were expected to be in the 0.4 - 3.3 mm range, the best estimate of the standard deviation in CAL was conservatively estimated to be 2.0 mm.  The minimum detectable difference was the minimum difference that is typically observed with currently available treatment for periodontal defects.  When comparing to the control device, 50 subjects per group were required.  Conservatively allowing for 15% attrition, each group was randomly allocated 60 subjects in order to allow for statistical power to be as calculated.

The CHMP noted that the Applicant only presented 60 patients treated with the proposed regimen for a group of indications that is  quite  common.  Moreover, an alpha level of 0.05 in the context of a single pivotal trial is considered too high (reference is made to CPMP/EWP/2330/99).

## Randomisation

The investigators used the randomization schedule based on variable block sizes of 3 and 6. The randomisation procedure was considered appropriate by the CHMP.

## Blinding (masking)

It  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  controlled,  parallel-arm,  pivotal  human  clinical  trial.  The  syringes containing the solution of becaplermin or buffer were identical so that all study personnel and subjects were unaware of the treatment assignment.

The double blinding was deemed acceptable for this kind of study by the CHMP.

## Statistical methods

The first analysis of the change in CAL for each group was a comparison to a historical benchmark of 1.5 mm.  If this first step was successful, the primary efficacy analysis was the comparison of Group I (0.3 mg/mL rhPDGF-BB) with group III (buffer alone), to establish superiority of the low concentration over control.  The comparison was to be made using a two-sample t-test and the result was to be considered positive if p ≤ 0.05 (one-sided).  It should be noted that this represents the amended statistical plan which according to the Applicant was solely motivated by the results of the pivotal study in dogs (BMPI 2003004).

Among  the  three  secondary  endpoints  listed  in  the  original  study  protocol  PDR  and  GR  were  both continuous variables to be analysed using two-sided t-tests; WH was to be analysed as a success (= score 0)/failure  (=  scores  1-4)  endpoint  using  a  chi-squared  test.  The  amended  protocol  also  established  new secondary efficacy endpoints, namely radiographic assessments and the AUC for CAL changes.  Other analyses added to the plan were comparisons to historical benchmarks of effectiveness for change in CAL, LBG, and %BF based on literature references.

The CHMP stated that the choice to use one-sided p-values is not appropriate. It would be conventional to consider the trial successful only if the two-sided p-value is &lt;0.05, which means the one-sided p-value needs to be &lt;0.025. Furthermore, since this is a single pivotal trial, the p-values should be even lower (reference is made to CPMP/EWP/2330/99).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Interim analysis

After  3-month  follow-up  was  obtained  on  approximately  one-half  of  the  subjects  (30  subjects  per treatment group, 90 total), an analysis was performed to verify the assumptions used in the original sample size calculation and to examine trends in effectiveness and safety variables.  No decisions were to be made concerning stopping the trial as a result of futility or better than expected effectiveness.  Thus, the overall significance level of the final analysis (5% Type I error) was maintained.

## RESULTS

## Participant flow

An overall of 99% of subjects (178/180) completed the study.  One subject was lost to follow-up and one subject refused to continue in the trial, but still agreed to return at the 6-month visit to provide efficacy measurements.

There were 174 patients (97%) that had complete sets of radiographic films (baseline and 6 months) and were included in the radiographic analysis; two patients were excluded because of study discontinuation, three because the radiographs were not evaluable, and one because the incorrect radiograph was received. No protocol deviations were considered able to affect the study outcome.

Periapical radiographs were taken at baseline, and at the 12 and 24 week post-surgery visits.  Six of the 180 randomised patients were excluded from the radiograph analysis due to study discontinuation (n=2), radiograph not evaluable (n=3) and receipt of a non-legible radiograph (n=1).

All patients were followed for a minimum of 24 weeks (6 months) post-surgery.

The CHMP noted that the patients lost during the study were not significant and appropriate justification was given.

## Recruitment

Patient recruitment was made by clinicians in eleven US centres.

The  CHMP  noted  that  despite  this  being  a  one  country  study  the  patient  demographics  showed  that patients had different ethnic origins.

## Conduct of the study

The study was conducted according the GCP as stated.

There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  groups  at  baseline,  except  for  'base  of defect to root apex' (p=0.044), which was not considered clinically meaningful.

Most  defects  were  1-  or  2-wall  defects.    The  CHMP  noted  that  the  data  presented  did  not  distinguish between  intrabony  and  furcation  defects,  the  usual  classification  in  clinical  trials,  which  will  have  an impact on the wording of the indication.

## Subgroup analyses

Descriptive subgroup analyses (no p values) were  performed on data from the study BMPI-2001-01 to determine  if  there  were  any  trends  within  demographic  variables  or  baseline  characteristics  that  could affect effectiveness outcomes.  Improved effectiveness outcomes were seen in patients with baseline areas of  defect  &gt;21 mm 2 ,  and  who  were  &lt;50  years  of  age  and  non-Caucasian.    Overall,  increased  LBG, improvements in %BF, and higher CAL gain were observed in non-smokers compared to smokers, and patients with three circumferential apical bone walls compared with patients with one or two apical bone walls.  However, no special population requirements were identified.

All three treatment groups showed a significant gain in clinical attachment level at 24 weeks (3.7, 3.7, and 3.5 mm, respectively) over an established historical value of 1.5 mm .

Seventy-two percent (72%) of patients in Group I experienced complete wound healing at 3-weeks postsurgery compared to 60% in Group II and 55% in Group III.  A statistically significant benefit was shown in Group I compared to Group III for clinical attachment level (CAL) gain and gingival recession at 12 weeks.  By week 24 Group I results were numerically superior to Group III, but the difference was not statistically  significant  for  CAL  gain  and  gingival  recession.    Statistically  significant  benefit  was  also shown in Group I compared to Group III for linear bone growth, and percent bone fill at 24 weeks, as well as the composite analyses.

The following table summarizes the most relevant comparisons between Group I and Group III:

Although  the  Applicant  claims  that  the  data,  when  taken  as  a  whole,  clearly  demonstrates  an  early beneficial effect of the 0.3 mg/mL rhPDGF-BB concentration, the study clearly fails the primary endpoint. In addition, the clinical relevance of the 12 th Week result is questioned when  this advantage disappears after 24 weeks as the main goal of these kind of treatments is the long-term results instead of the short term ones. In addition to the extremely short clinical program this is also a major issue of the dossier.

Although the Applicant states that Gemesis was statistically significantly better than the control at month 3  for  both  clinical  attachment  level  gain  and  gingival  recession  gain,  this  is  not  correct.  As  1-sided  pvalues have been presented the critical value is p&lt;0.025 rather than p&lt;0.05, even before we consider that this is a single pivotal trial (meaning the level should be even more extreme); p&lt;0.025 is not achieved for either of these endpoints.

In summary, the study clearly fails the primary endpoint. Despite the Applicant's claims, when we note that 1-sided p-values were used, a statistically significant difference was not seen at week 12. In any case,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

any advantage seen at week 12 on CAL was not sustained and disappears after 24 weeks. The long term results should be seen as more relevant than the short term ones as the ultimate goal is tooth preservation

## Secondary Endpoints

## CAL Gain Group II versus Group III

The comparison of CAL gain at 24 weeks between Groups II and III was made as a secondary endpoint to determine  if  there  were  differences  in  efficacy  between  the  two  rhPDGF-BB  concentrations  when compared  to  the  control.  There  is  no  significant  difference  in  CAL  gain  at  either  12  (p=0.403)  or  24 (p=0.287) weeks between Groups II and III.

## AUC of CAL gain

The  area  under  the  curve  (AUC)  of  CAL  gain  from  baseline  to  24-weeks  post-surgery  approached statistical significance in Group I compared to Group III (p=0.054).  This analysis represents the gain in CAL between baseline and six months.  The data for the analysis are displayed in the table below:

CAL  gain  from  baseline  to  24  weeks  post-surgery  using  a  historically  established  level  of  clinical effectiveness of 1.5 mm showed that all 3 treatment groups had a CAL gain above this level (3.7 mm; 3.7 mm; and 3.5 mm in Groups I, II and III, respectively) that was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001).

## Pocket Depth Reduction (PDR)

There  were  no  significant  differences  in  probing  pocket  depth  reduction  (PDR)  between  the  groups  at either the 12 or 24-week time-points.

## Gingival Recession (GR)

Gingival recession improved significantly in Group I as compared to Group III (p=0.041) at the 12-week time-point.    No  statistically  significant  differences  were  observed  at  the  24-week  time-point.    No statistically significant differences were observed for the comparison between Group II and Group III at both the 12 and 24-week time-points.

## Wound Healing

Three weeks post-surgery, 72% of Group I patients experienced complete healing compared to 60% in Group II  and  55%  in  Group  III.    The  differences  between  the  groups  were  not  statistically  significant (p=0.138 Group I vs. Group III; p=0.442 Group II vs. Group III).

## Linear Bone Growth

Linear bone growth (LBG) was calculated as the difference between baseline and 24 weeks post-surgery in 'cemento-enamel junction to base of defect'.  A statistically significant increase in LBG was observed in Groups I and II as compared to Group III as shown in the table below:

Percent Bone Fill (%BF)

Percent  bone  fill  was  defined  as  the  percent  of  the  original  osseous  defect  filled  with  new  bone  as measured  radiographically.    At  24-weeks  post-surgery,  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  %BF  was observed in Groups I and II as compared to Group III:

## · Additional Statistical Analyses

## Composite analysis

An analysis was performed to determine the percent of patients with a successful combined outcome for hard and soft tissue components of the periodontium.

When the composite endpoints were applied to the BMPI-2001-01 data, Group I demonstrated statistically significant differences when compared to Group III for both composite endpoints:

Overall the results in Group I or II were not better than the results in Group III in 4 of the seven secondary endpoints. The secondary endpoints did not clearly favour the proposed therapeutic dose. None of them showed better results of Group I over Group II.

Although the comparison with the historical background is interesting it has obvious limitations.

In  summary,  it  is  difficult  to  consider,  with  the  available  data,  that  0.3 mg/mL  rhPDGF-BB  when administered together with β -TCP improves the clinical results when compared with β -TCP alone. The concentration of rhPDGF as 0.3 mg/mL seems to perform better than the higher concentration when both are compared with the β -TCP alone on CAL gain, linear bone growth and percent bone fill.

## Study extension

The  primary  focus  of  the  extension  study  was  to  collect  long-term  radiographic  (LBG  and  %BF)  and clinical  data  (CAL,  PD  and  GR).  Results  have  been  reported  through  36  months  for  patients  who continued for the duration of the extension trial. This study enrolled 135 of the 180 patients that completed the treatment and follow-up phases of the Pivotal study (Study BMPI-2001-01). 131 of the 135 patients enrolled in the extension study were evaluated at 12 months, 88 were evaluated at 24 months and 83 were evaluated at 36 months.

The analyses were only performed in the patients that completed the follow-up period in question and missing data were not taken into account. Three different patient sets were analysed for the results at 12, 24 and 36 months.  The tests were one-sided, so p-values should be doubled to allow interpretation in accordance with conventional standards. Out of the 11 centres involved in the pivotal trial, 9 participated in the extension study up to 12 months and only 6 up to 36 months.

Few baseline characteristics were provided for the patient subsets studied, except for smoking status and type of bone defect (number of walls, vertical bone defect depth).  There were slightly more severe defects in the control group than in the 0.3 mg/ml group.  The Applicant also performed a comparison of these baseline characteristics as well as the 6-month results between the various patient subsets and the patients with no data available ('survivor analysis').  Overall, there were more 1-2 wall defects and the 6-month results tended to be less favourable in the patients with no follow-up data.

At 24 months, Gemesis patients showed the greatest clinical improvement in CAL gain, PD reduction and GR when compared to patients in the β -TCP alone group. For all other clinical measures, Gemesis patients maintained  an  overall  level  of  clinical  improvement  that  was  superior  to  that  of  patients  in  the β -TCP group; however, the differences were not statistically significant. At 36 months all effects are no longer significant due to improvements observed for the patients who received β -TCP alone.

Inconsistent results were shown for the two composite endpoints.  Only the endpoint using the linear bone growth (LBG) exhibited a significantly higher success rate with Gemesis (0.3 mg/ml) than with the matrix alone (p&lt;0.05 with a two-sided test) at 12, 24 and 36 months (at 36 months: 87% vs. 54%, respectively). The difference in the endpoint using the percent bone fill (%BF) was not significant at any time point (at 36 months: 87% vs. 72%, respectively).

Subgroup  analyses  of  radiographic  outcomes  according  to  the  severity  of  the  defect  were  performed although patient numbers were small in some of these groups; these analyses had not been conducted for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the pivotal trial.  The effects of becaplermin 0.3 mg/ml were less pronounced in the most severe defects (1-2 walls, vertical depth &lt;6mm).

Finally, these follow-up data confirmed that the high dose had only marginal effects, if any. Moreover, the long-term data does not add any support to the demonstration of a substantial benefit over the use of the matrix alone.  On the contrary, these long-term data showed a decline of the benefit of Gemesis over time in terms of bone gain while this was the only statistically significant benefit reported in the short-term. Furthermore, no safety data were collected.

## · Clinical studies in special populations

The  only  data  available  in  at  risk  patients  are  those  observed  in  smokers,  which  are  not  encouraging. Overall, there is a clear need for more data in patients with risk factors for impaired wound healing.

- Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis)

The Company compared the results of study number BMPI-2001-01 with two sets of meta-analysis data that  were  independently  collected  and  published  in  a  peer-reviewed  journal  (Reynolds et  al .  2003  and Giannobile et  al .  2003).    In  addition  a  third  analysis  was  conducted . A Bayesian  model  was  used  to perform  this  meta-analysis  on  9  allograft  studies  and  8 Emdogain studies  in  comparison  to Gemesis 0.3 mg/mL Group I of study number BMPI-2001-01 (Schoenfeld 2004).

The  historical  comparison  with  other  available  alternatives  seems  to  favour  the  Gemesis  treatment. Nevertheless  these  comparisons  have  strong  methodological  problems.  The β -TCP  results  in  such comparisons  seem  to  be  better  or  equivalent  to  other  historical  controls  raising  concerns  about  the reliability  of  such  comparisons.  Hence,  these  comparisons  do  not  allow  overcoming  the  clinical insufficient program and results provided.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

The clinical development plan for the efficacy of Gemesis in the treatment of periodontally related defects includes only one pivotal trial (BMPI-2001-01). The primary endpoint for this study was the change from baseline to month 6 in clinical attachment level (CAL), comparing the low dose of Gemesis (0.3 mg/mL) to  the β -TCP  matrix  control  (after  amendment  of  the  study  protocol).    No  statistically  significant differences were observed in this study concerning the primary efficacy analysis. The bone gain analysis did have positive results, but the remainder of the secondary endpoints also failed to show a difference. Moreover, the bone gain achieved in the control group was especially poor and was not consistent with the results of several other trials with hydroxyapatite ceramics. In view of these results there was a lack of internal consistency with all important endpoints.

An interim analysis after 3 months revealed that Gemesis lead to better results in the primary endpoint clinical  attachment  level  (CAL)  and  the  secondary  endpoint  gingival  recession  (GR).  The  level  of significance reached was in both cases p=0.041, however as these were 1-sided p-values the critical value is p&lt;0.025 rather than p&lt;0.05. Moreover, this non-significant advantage disappeared after 6 months and long-term follow-up data of 36 months showed no difference for Gemesis compared to the β -TCP matrix alone. This raised additional doubts about the long term efficacy of Gemesis.

Moreover, results from the single pivotal trial were better for the low concentration (0.3 mg/mL) than for the high concentration (1.0 mg/mL) and the true significance of this finding remained unknown.

Overall,  it  is  not  considered  that  this  study  has  provided  robust  evidence  of  efficacy  to  the  standards required for a marketing authorisation as the Applicant failed to demonstrate that adding becaplermin to the  calcium  phosphate  matrix  increases  the  performance  of  the  device  in  terms  of  both  clinical  and radiographic measurements.

Concerning  supportive  studies,  in  the  summary  provided  by  the  Applicant,  CAL  gain  outcomes  were presented  for  all  studies.    It  is  noteworthy  that  all  three  phase  II  (small)  studies  comparing  the  two

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concentrations of becaplermin associated with β -TCP showed better results with the higher dose.  Thus, the  rationale  for  the  change  to  the  statistical  plan  of  the  pivotal  trial  by  the  Applicant  in  favour  of  the lower dose remains unclarified.

Histological evidence of true regeneration has been provided for the association of becaplermin with β -TCP matrix. Nevertheless the provided histological information in humans does not allow concluding that there is a gain in adding becaplermin to β -TCP as no direct comparisons were made, i.e., β -TCP with or without becaplermin. The results of the dog study, although useful, are difficult to extrapolate due to the lack of comparative binding affinity data of rhPDGF-BB to animal and human target receptors.

Therefore the CHMP concluded that the additional results are not sufficient to further support a marketing authorisation for Gemesis.

## Clinical safety

Data for the evaluation of safety of the combination of β -TCP with rhPDGF-BB were derived from the randomised, controlled pivotal study. Following surgery for periodontal disease and implantation of the study article, the patients were observed regularly up to the end of the follow-up period of 24 weeks.

## · Patient exposure

A  total  of  178/180  patients  were  followed  clinically  for  24 weeks.    For  the  two  patients  that  did  not complete the 24-week follow-up, safety was collected up to the time of discontinuation.

|                    |   Patients enrolled |   Patients exposed |   Patients exposed to the proposed dose range |   Patients with long term* safety data |
|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Active -controlled |                 180 |                120 |                                            60 |                                     60 |

The number of patients exposed to the proposed dose range is only 60. This figure is very low for such frequent clinical setting.

Upon request after the Day 120 questions the Applicant provided additional information that can be summarised as follows:

- Of the 204 patients (212 treatment sites) who received rhPDGF-BB in the Pivotal study and the five  additional  periodontal  studies;  116  treatment  sites  received  the Gemesis configuration  (0.3 mg/mL rhPDGF-BB + β -TCP); 83 treatment sites received 1.0 mg/mL rhPDGF-BB + the Gemesis β -TCP; and 13 treatment sites received a combination of  rhPDGF-BB  +  DFDBA  or DFDBA/Xenograft. The 1.0 mg/mL treatment represents a greater than three fold dose compared to Gemesis .
- Greater than 70,000 units of Gemesis have been sold in the US and Canada since 2005 with no adverse events reported through the Medical Device Reporting system.
- More  than  600  patients  have  been  enrolled  in  orthopaedic  studies,  adding  substantially  more safety  data  on  the  0.3  mg/mL  dose  of  rhPDGF-BB  in  combination  with β -TCP.  Given  that patients  can  receive  up  to  9  mLs  of  rhPDGF-BB  (0.3  mg/mL)  in  the  orthopaedic  studies;  this represents a potential 18-fold increase in patient exposure to rhPDGF-BB compared to treatment with Gemesis .  The  summary of the results  of  both  ongoing  and completed  orthopaedic  clinical trials  provide  additional  data  regarding  the  safe  clinical  use  of  rhPDGF-BB  in  musculoskeletal applications.
- There were no serious surgical complications observed with rhPDGF-BB, and no serious adverse events  that  were  considered  related  to  study  treatment.  The  rates  and  types  of  adverse  event occurrence  were  as  expected  for  subjects  undergoing  ankle  or  hindfoot  fusions  or  distal  radius fracture repair procedures, respectively.

## · Adverse events

The most frequently reported adverse event was study site pain (102/270; 38%), followed by headache (15/270;  6%)  tooth  disorder  (12/270;  4%),  tooth  pain  (11/270;  4%),  backache  (8/270;  3%),  and  flu syndrome (8/270, 3%).

The adverse events distribution per group is summarised in the next table:

- 1 Includes bleeding, bruising, pain, swelling, and tenderness of the treatment site following surgery. All are expected sequelae from periodontal surgical grafting procedures.
- 2 Includes disorders (e.g. sensitivity) at a location other than the surgical site.
- 3 Includes pain unrelated to the surgical procedure and at a location other than the surgical site.

Adverse  events  reported  by  the  investigator  as  likely  related  to  study  article  included  study  site  pain (n=16) and loss of interdental papilla (n=1; Group II patient) . One adverse event for study site pain was judged by the investigator as definitely related to the study article (n=1; Group III patient).

There were no significant differences in AE reporting between the treatment groups. Analysis by Organ System or Syndrome was not performed as a systemic effect is not anticipated.

The Applicant has provided efficacy results up to 36 months.  However, the safety issues (especially with regard to repeated applications, risk of malignancy and immunogenicity) have not been addressed and the Applicant has not provided any plan for collecting such data.

## · Serious adverse events and deaths

There were 4 serious AEs, none of which was judged as being study article related . These were spine surgery requiring hospitalisation (n=1), complication of diabetes (n=1), bronchitis requiring hospitalisation (n=1), and operative removal of a skin cancer (n=1). There were 4 severe AEs, none of which  was  judged  as  being  study  article  related.    These  were  back  pain  (n=1),  stomach  ulcer  (n=1), headache (n=1), and surgical site reaction (n=1).

There were no deaths during the observation period post-surgery.

The safety profile of Regranex, which contains the same active substance as Gemesis and is authorised in the EU and many other countries outside the EU since 1998, was described in a review of 6 controlled clinical studies in patients with lower extremity diabetic neuropathic ulcers (Smiell, 1998).  Among 538 patients  that  received  becaplermin  gel  (30  µg/g  or  100  µg/g)  erythematous  rash  occurred  in  2%  of  the patients  with  suspected  wound  infections  vs.  1%  in  the  patients  treated  with  placebo  gel;  none  was observed  in  patients  treated  with  good  ulcer  care  alone.    The  incidence  of  infections,  cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and central and peripheral nervous system disorders were similar across all treatment groups.

It is acknowledged that the reference to Regranex may bring some useful information since it is obvious that the exposure to becaplermin through a daily topical application for up to 20 weeks with a gel dosed at 100µg/g  of  becaplermin  must  be  much  higher  than  a  single  dose  of  0.15  mg.    However,  repeated application of Gemesis is possible to some extent as some patients may be submitted to several surgical procedures at different sites. No studies have been conducted, and no Pharmacovigilance data is available, in  patients  having  several  surgical  procedures  utilising  Gemesis  at  different  sites.  Nevertheless  none  of those patients treated at multiple sites during a single procedure in the periodontal clinical studies received more than the maximum dose of Gemesis allowed (0.15 mg rhPDGF-BB).

A warning was issued by the FDA March 2008 regarding the possibility of an increased risk of death from cancer in patients who had repeated treatments with Regranex.  In addition, a recent paper suggests that periodontal disease itself may be associated with a small, but significant, increase in overall cancer risk, even in never-smokers.  By cancer site, significant associations were found for lung (probably because of residual confounding by smoking since the association was not noted in never-smokers), kidney, pancreas, and  haematological  cancers.    Currently,  it  is  not  known  whether  periodontal  disease  is  a  marker  of  a susceptible immune system or might directly affect cancer risk through systemic inflammation, pathogenic invasion into the blood stream, or immune response to periodontal infection (Michaud et al. , 2008).

Overall, there is a clear need for a long-term observational study in order to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of Gemesis, including the effects of repeated applications on safety and immunogenicity. As already mentioned earlier, Gemesis is proposed to be contraindicated in patients with tumours.

- Laboratory findings

Study protocol did not include clinical laboratory evaluations.

- Safety in special populations

No data were provided. According to the Applicant there are  no intrinsic  ethnic  differences  associated with the use of rhPDGF-BB in humans.  Descriptive subgroup analyses were performed to determine if there  were  any  trends  within  demographic  variables  or  baseline  characteristics  that  could  increase effectiveness  outcomes.    A  trend  toward  improved  effectiveness  outcomes  were  seen  in  patients  with baseline areas of defect &gt;21 mm 2 , and who were &lt;50 years of age and non-Caucasian.  Overall, increased LBG, improvements in %BF, and higher CAL gain were observed in non-smokers compared to smokers, and patients with three circumferential apical bone walls compared with patients with one or two apical bone walls.  However, no special population requirements were identified.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pregnant women and women intending to become pregnant were excluded from the clinical study.  No studies have been conducted for Gemesis on the effect of rhPDGF-BB on human reproductive toxicity. Until relevant data are available, Gemesis is not considered suitable for use during pregnancy or lactation. Therefore, Gemesis is contraindicated for use in pregnant women.

## · Immunological events

No antibody measurement has been performed in patients treated with Gemesis.  A literature search on the clinical use of rhPDGF-BB and the risk of an immunologic response has been provided by the Applicant. Repeated  daily  applications  on  neuropathic  or  pressure  ulcers  for  up  to  20  weeks  resulted  in  a  low incidence  of  anti-PDGF  antibodies  (0.4  to  6%).    No  neutralising  antibodies  to  PDGF  have  ever  been detected.

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

As Gemesis is  not  administered  systemically  but  is  delivered  locally  and  is  implanted  in  a  single  dose containing 0.15 mg rhPDGF-BB, the clinical programme did not include testing of rhPDGF-BB for drug interactions. PDGF is a naturally occurring protein that is released from platelets at the site of an injury. Additionally,  patients  enrolled  in  the  pivotal  clinical  study  took  a  variety  of  concomitant  medications, including drugs to treat pain, depression/anxiety, hypertension, diabetes, asthma/allergies, hyperthyroidism, arthritis, seizures, gastric reflux, birth control, sexual dysfunction, and post-menopausal symptoms (hormone replacement and osteoporosis).  No adverse events related to drug interactions were reported in the study.

## · Discontinuation due to AES

Not reported.

- Discussion on clinical safety

The available  safety  data  is  derived  from  one  clinical  trial  with  a  total  of  121  patients  exposed  to  two different  doses  of  Gemesis  for  6  months.  A  low  rate  of  associated  adverse  events  and  no  serious  or unanticipated adverse events attributable to Gemesis were observed. The most frequently reported adverse events were study site pain followed by headache, tooth disorder, tooth pain, backache and flu syndrome. Four serious adverse events were reported but none could be attributed to the treatment with Gemesis. These results suggest that a single treatment with β -TCP, with and without the adjunctive use of rhPDGF, is reasonably safe in periodontal procedures. However, the number of subjects treated in this trial is rather limited (121 patients). In fact only 60 patients were exposed to the actual proposed dose of 0.3 mg/ml and the patients were only followed for six months and no long-term safety follow-up data is available in order to detect unanticipated adverse effects. In view of the wide potential target population for Gemesis the size of  the  safety  database  was  not  considered  sufficient  without  long-term  post-marketing  observational studies.  Furthermore, a slight concern remained with regards to potential risks associated with possible repeated applications of Gemesis, such as carcinogenicity and immunogenicity, in patients with several surgical procedures at different sites.

## Risk Management Plan

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application was of the opinion that it was not appropriate to consider risk minimisation activities at this time.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.5 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

Although  to  some  extent  the  data  submitted  provide  evidence  with  respect  to  the  quality  of  Gemesis, major issues related to the quality of the product and their potential impact on efficacy and safety were identified by the CHMP as follows:

## Comparability of the drug product

The company did not present convincing characterisation data to support the comparability of the drug product before and after the changes to the manufacturing process (i.e. change of site and scale) in relation to  those  forms  that  have  a  decreased  biological  activity.  The  method  used  for  retrospective  analysis  of released  batches  does  not  distinguish  between  forms  with  reduced  potency.  Nevertheless  the  company presented  an  extensive  characterisation  for  the  qualification  of  reference  standards.  This  was  the  only study presented where the content of forms with reduced potency were performed using another method and demonstrated to be equivalent. In the absence of data analysing the previous clinical lots in terms of quantification of forms by this other method, it can not be concluded that no significant changes on the quality attributes occurred between the clinical batches and the commercial product.

## Forms with reduced potency

The occurrence of high levels of forms with reduced bioactivity raises several concerns with respect to the consistency of the quality of the product and its uniform clinical performance.

First,  the  company  was  not  able  to  demonstrate  that  there  is  no  partition  effect  on  product  related impurities upon interaction with the β -TCP component. Results using the bioassay to quantify other forms and to demonstrate that there is no partition effect are not convincing given the wide variability of this bioassay and given that results are inconsistent with other results provided in the application. Therefore, a more direct quantification of the other forms is required to unequivocally demonstrate that no partition occurs favouring the presence of less potent forms.

Second, there are high levels of forms of reduced potency in the drug substance and drug product which are not appropriately controlled. The company proposed to tighten the limit of the specification for other forms in drug substance lots based on the claimed positive outcome of non-clinical and clinical data. The proposed reduction does not constitute a significant reduction of other forms and it is not validated in light of the inconclusive clinical results. Also, the possibility that the forms of reduced potency may also be a degradation  impurity  has  not  been  adequately  investigated  and  addressed.  Since  the  possible  partition effect cannot be ruled out, a significant reduction and adequate control of the other forms at the level of the drug product is important to ensure consistent product production and since these forms may have a detrimental impact on the uniform clinical performance of the product. It is possible that this will only be possible  by  making  significant  changes  such  as  including  additional  purification  steps  for  the  drug substance.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The non-clinical part of the dossier for Gemesis is not entirely satisfactory. There is a rationale for the inclusion of rhPDGF-BB in the scaffold, but the only proof of concept study which is meaningful for the periodontal indication applied gave moderate evidence of efficacy and it is not clear whether a lower dose can be used. In addition, no studies were performed by the Applicant to study the affinity and interaction pattern of rhPDGF-BB to the human receptors as compared to human PDGF, and to the target receptors in the  species  used  for  pharmacology  and  toxicology  studies.  This  reduces  the  value  of  the  results  of  the safety  studies  performed  and  again  questions  the  basis  for  clinical  dose  selection.  The  application  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rhPDGF-BB will be local, but a leakage from the site of application into periodontal tissue, namely the gingiva, might be possible and the consequence is not clearly defined. Given the clinical experience with the matrix scaffold, no additional studies were deemed necessary.   However, several concerns related to the safety of rhPDGF-BB were not sufficiently clarified by the Applicant.

## Efficacy

The clinical development plan for the efficacy of Gemesis in the treatment of periodontally related defects includes only one pivotal trial which failed its primary endpoint. Even though the use of Gemesis led to significant improvements in the secondary endpoints linear bone growth (LBG) and % bone fill (% BF)  at 6 months (radiological secondary outcomes), it failed to show a significant difference in terms of other secondary  endpoints. Therefore a general lack of  consistency  between  important  endpoints  was recognised. Furthermore, long term data of up to 36 months showed that the claimed initial bone gain obtained with Gemesis as compared to the β -TCP matrix alone was not maintained further questioning the long-term benefit of the product. Moreover, the reason for the better outcomes for the low concentration of Gemesis compared to the high concentration was not sufficiently explained by the Applicant and its importance remains unknown. The data from the additional phase II trials and the supportive data were insufficient to compensate for the deficiencies of the pivotal trial. Overall, the Applicant failed to provide convincing  evidence  of  efficacy  and  therefore  the  benefits  of  adding  becaplermin  to  the β -TCP matrix were not confirmed.

## Safety

The  available  safety  data  derived  from  the  only  clinical  study  performed  suggests  that  the  single application of β -TCP, with and without the adjunctive use of rhPDGF, was reasonably safe in periodontal procedures  with  a  low  rate  of  associated  adverse  events  (AEs)  and  no  serious  or  unanticipated  AEs attributable  to  Gemesis.    However,  the  number  of  subjects  treated  in  this  trial  is  rather  limited  (121 patients). In fact only 60 patients were exposed to the actual proposed dose of 0.3 mg/ml and the patients were only followed for six months and no long-term safety follow-up data is available in order to detect unanticipated adverse effects. In view of the wide potential target population for Gemesis the size of the safety  database  was  not  considered  sufficient  without  long-term  post-marketing  observational  studies. Furthermore, a slight concern remained with regards to potential risks associated with possible repeated applications  of  Gemesis,  such  as  carcinogenicity  and  immunogenicity,  in  patients  with  several  surgical procedures at different sites.

## Risk-benefit assessment

The rationale of Gemesis is based on the addition of a growth factor to a matrix in order to enhance its capacity for tissue regeneration since periodontal regeneration is a fundamental therapeutic objective for the maintenance of teeth in health and function.

Although the product seems to have a low rate of associated AEs, the safety database from controlled studies on the proposed indications is small. In addition the patients were only followed for six months concerning safety.

It is considered that the addition of the growth factor must improve the efficacy of the matrix in order to justify  the  authorisation  of  the  combination.  This  potential  has  been  insufficiently  supported  by  the provided clinical data as the only clinical study failed the primary endpoint. The supportive studies are clearly insufficient to compensate the pivotal trial results. In addition, it is not proven that the potential treatment benefit is sustained over a year or more as compared to β -TCP alone. There is evidence that the claimed initial gain over the β -TCP was not maintained beyond 6 months.

It is not considered that historical comparisons showing similar efficacy of the combination to other graft materials is sufficient to grant a marketing authorisation for Gemesis.

Overall, the results of the single pivotal trial do not show convincing evidence that adding becaplermin to the matrix is of any benefit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The lack of substantial efficacy of the combination as compared with the matrix alone cannot outweigh the low risk of adverse reactions. There is a slight concern about potential carcinogenicity.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, the CHMP considers that, following review of the data provided, there are major concerns with  respect  to  the  risk-benefit  of  Gemesis  in  the  treatment  of  periodontally  related  defects  on  the following grounds:

- -Efficacy has not been demonstrated for the proposed indications as the single pivotal trial failed the primary  end  point.  The  data  from  other  phase  II  trials  are  insufficient  to  compensate  for  the deficiencies  of  the  pivotal  trial.  In  addition,  the  long  term  data  showed  that  after  36  months  the initial  bone  gain  claimed  with  Gemesis  as  compared  to  the β -TCP  matrix  alone  was  no  longer observed.
- -The binding affinity and interaction pattern of recombinant human PDGF to the human receptors and  to  the  receptors  in  the  animal  species  used  for  the  pharmacology  and  toxicology  studies  as compared to human PDGF was not sufficiently clarified.
- -The  comparability  of  product  used  in  clinical  studies  and  product  intended  to  be  placed  on  the market had not been demonstrated.
- -The  levels  of  forms  with  reduced  potency  in  the  active  substance/finished  product  are  not appropriately controlled. The levels must be greatly reduced to ensure consistent product production and  accurate  measure  of  becaplermin-specific  biological  activity.  It  has  not  been  unequivocally demonstrated that there is no partition effect upon interaction with the β -TCP component favouring the presence of the less potent forms.
- -Due to the aforementioned concerns, a satisfactory summary of product characteristics, pharmacovigilance  system,  risk  management  plan  and  follow-up  measures  to  address  other concerns as outlined in the list of outstanding issues cannot be agreed at this stage.

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Gemesis in the treatment of periodontally related defects was unfavourable and therefore did not recommend the granting of the marketing authorisation.

## 3. RE-EXAMINATION OF THE CHMP OPINION

At the July 2009 CHMP meeting, the CHMP concluded that the risk-benefit balance of Gemesis, that is intended for the following indications:

- For bone and periodontal regeneration in adult patients only.

- -To treat periodontally related defects, including:
- Intrabony/Infrabony periodontal defects; and
- Furcation periodontal defects; and
- Gingival recession associated with periodontal defects,

was unfavourable and therefore did not recommend the granting of the marketing authorisation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

On 22 September 2009, the applicant submitted the detailed grounds for the re-examination of the grounds for refusal listed above.

## Ground for Refusal 1

The comparability of product used in clinical studies and product intended to be placed on the market had not been demonstrated.

- Company ´s response

BioMimetic  Therapeutics,  Inc.  (BMTI)  acknowledges  that  a  direct  comparison  of  rhPDGFBB  Drug Product  lots  was  not  performed  during  the  transition  from  the  production  of  clinical  materials  to  the manufacture of commercial product. However, analytical data are available for a retrospective comparison of  the  characteristics  of  one  clinical  lot,  filled  at  Chesapeake  Biological  Laboratories,  with  the  initial commercial batches, filled at Patheon, and product manufactured in 2005, 2006, and 2007  for commercial distribution.

The rhPDGF-BB Drug Product is produced by a simple dilution of the Drug Substance in an aqueous sodium  acetate  buffer.  The  buffer  composition  is  identical  to  the  buffer  used  to  prepare  the  Drug Substance.  The  preparation  of  the  Drug  Product  is  performed  in  a  controlled  environment  following  a validated  production  process  to  reduce  the  potential  for  introducing  changes.  BMTI  acknowledges  that changes in the characteristics of rhPDGF-BB (such as an increase in the percentage of two forms) can affect the biological activity of rhPDGF-BB since both variants have a reduced potency. However, the fact that the content of one form is consistently below the limit of quantitation - also during long term stability -  makes  it  unlikely  to  impact  the  biological  activity.  Furthermore,  BMTI  proposes  to  tighten  the specification of this form.

Previous  work  suggests  that  the  intact  and  one  variant  of  rhPDGF-BB  have  similar  biological  activity, while  another  variant  of  rhPDGF-BB  has  reduced  biological  activity.  The  different  variants  have  been isolated by high temperature HPLC and assayed in a bioassay used for release of drug substance and drug product.

The bioassay is able to detect differences in product potency. When intact (IN) rhPDGF-BB is spiked with a  known  amount  of  the  other  species,  two  bioassays  were  sufficiently  sensitive  to  detect  a  decline  in bioactivity in response to an increasing proportion of the variant with reduced bioactivity.

A revised specification has been established for the level of the reduced-potency form acceptable in the rhPDGF-BB DS.

The variants of the material differ substantially in the test profile of one method indicating the appropriate use  of  this  method  to  show  changes  in  the  variants  although  direct  measurement  of  the  variant  is  best achieved by another method.

Data obtained from testing clinical and commercial batches of Drug Product are presented. These data demonstrate the consistency of the manufacturing process for the transition from production of clinical materials to the manufacture of Drug Product for commercial distribution.

- CHMP conclusion

The data package provided by the Applicant on the comparability between the product used for phase III clinical  trial  and  the  product  intended  for  the  market,  has  been  reviewed.  No  new  information  is presented; the Applicant's opinion is based on the same evaluation as was submitted during the original assessment

A number of changes in the manufacturing process have taken place both for the drug substance and for the  drug  product  between phase III clinical studies and the initial commercial manufacturing process., Considering  the  heterogeneity  of  the  drug  substance,  with  emphasis  on  the  forms  with  significantly

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reduced  biological  activity,  and  the  nature  of  the  changes  introduced  to  the  manufacturing  process,  a comprehensive evaluation would be required in order to satisfactorily demonstrate comparability between the product used in late clinical trials and the product intended for the market. No direct comparison is however available.

For  qualification  of  reference  standards,  the  Applicant  provides  a  characterisation  analysis  including determination of different rhPDGF-BB forms. The results suggest similar degree of the different forms in the  three  standard  batches  analysed.  The  batch  results  included  for  one  clinical  batch,  three  initial commercial batches, and for commercial batches produced in 2005, 2006, and 2007, do not confirm the level of forms with the reduced-potency as the method in use is unable to separate the  forms with normal biological bioactivity and reduced bioactivity. This is a major deficiency, which cannot be compensated by the potency data as proposed by the Applicant. The differences in the potency test results for protein preparations  with  differing  ratios  of    forms  are  very  small  and  they  are  further  diluted  by  the  high variability of the cell-based potency assays. The main problem, however, is the lack of data on forms with reduced bioactivity in the clinical DP batches, which hampers the comparability assessment between the clinical and commercial lots.

As a conclusion, the reassessment of the comparability data provided leads to the same conclusion as in the  original  evaluation,  i.e.  comparability  between  the  product  used  for  clinical  trials  and  the  current commercial material, has not been properly demonstrated.

## Ground for Refusal 2

The levels of forms with reduced potency in the active substance/finished product are not appropriately controlled.  The  levels  must  be  greatly  reduced  to  ensure  consistent  product  production  and  accurate measure of becaplermin specific biological activity. It has not been unequivocally demonstrated that there is no partition effect upon interaction with the β TCP component favouring the presence of the less potent forms.

## · Company´s response

There are two molecular variants of becaplermin that demonstrate reduced activity. However, the fact that the content of one form is consistently below the limit of quantitation - also during long term stability makes it unlikely that this form will impact the biological activity. The other variants have been isolated under high temperature and assayed in the bioassay used for release of drug substance and drug product. The content of forms of reduced potency in the Drug Substance originates from the biosynthesis in yeast and  the  fermentation  process.  During  product  development  in  the  1990s  the  yeast  cell  construct  was changed in order to achieve a reduction in material with reduced bioactivity.  The current yeast construct has been shown to produce rhPDGF-BB with a consistent and decreased amount of material with reduced bioactivity, and this active drug substance is the basis for both Regranex and GEMESIS . According to the Applicant, a further reduction of the content of material with reduced bioactivity would only be possible either by developing a new engineered yeast strain for production or by eliminating the cleavage site by recombinant technology. Attempts to separate the variants using chromatography have not been successful either.

According to the Applicant, Drug Substance lots used by the company for all non-clinical, clinical and commercial  scale  DP  lots  have  had  the  same  specifications  for  material  with  reduced  bioactivity.  The revised specifications for the respective forms were set by evaluation of the manufacturing variability of Commercial lots. While the first method is used to analyze the rhPDGF-BB DS, the second method is used for analysis of both the DS and the DP, and can be used to quantify the percentage of the protein that is cleaved. The Applicant has provided retrospective characterisation data using the first method; however the batches studied do not contain the clinical lots.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Although  the  potency  material  with  reduced  bioactivity  is  decreased,  the  overall  potency  of  the  Drug Product, as measured by the bioassay that uses a working standard calibrated against the WHO rhPDGFBB International Standard 94/728 and expressed in International Units per mg protein, is still considered adequate to exert a biological action. This is evidenced by the body of non-clinical and clinical data on safety and efficacy of rhPDGF-BB.

Mixing and elution kinetics of rhPDGF-BB from the β -TCP component of GEMESIS have been studied. The interaction of the rhPDGF-BB with the β -TCP ceramic material is minimal with no adsorption of the protein to the β -TCP, but rather, physical entrapment of the liquid containing the protein between the β -TCP particles. Analysis of the eluted rhPDGF-BB has shown that the eluted protein is chemically identical to  the  protein  present  in  the  starting  material.  The  results  demonstrate  that  the  ratio  of  variants  is  not affected by the β -TCP matrix, and hence there is no partition effect on the variants of rhPDGF-BB.

Although  the  first  method  was  performed  to  directly  quantify  the  variant,  the  profiles  of  the  second method showed that the overall amount of variants was consistent.

## · CHMP conclusion

The overall content of truncated forms in the DS is very high. At release and during stability studies, the Applicant has followed truncated DP variants by the second method, which unfortunately is not able to separate the variants. The first method has been used as part of retrospective characterisation to verify the  amount  of    forms  with  reduced  potency  in  the  commercial  batches  and  the  levels.  The  original specification  set  by  the  company  for  all  forms  for  individual  batches  exceed  the  specification  for  all batches.

The statement about the variants occurring during the fermentation only is not substantiated by data. In the  study  report,  the  Applicant  mentions  'partial  nicking'  occurring  during  fermentation,  which  could mean that part of the variant occurs later during the process. It cannot be also excluded that part of the enzyme  responsible  could  be  co-purified  with  the  drug  substance.  Since  data  obtained  with  the  first method for the forms with reduced potency is not available for process validation, stability evaluation, nor for DP batch release, the company's claims cannot be endorsed. It is also unclear; why the Applicant has restricted the purification attempts to chromatography and not tried other possibilities to reduce the level of the form.

The acceptable level for forms with reduced potency in the final product should be justified by functional, non-clinical  and  clinical  data.  The  functionality  of  the  recombinant  PDGF  is  clearly  impaired  by  the missing parts of the Beta-strand and the reason to allow administration of significant amounts of forms with  reduced  potency  into  the  patients  is  questionable.  The  correlation  between  heterogeneity  of  the rhPDGF  and  the  potency  of  the  product  has  not  been  demonstrated;  the  differences  between  spiked materials are very small and should be considered negligible as the variability of the cell-based potency assays  is  high.  Neither  are  the  signals  from  non-clinical  and  clinical  studies  supporting  the  view  of adequate, controlled biological activity for the product.

Regarding  the  partition  effect,  the  Applicant  has,  again,  studied  this  possibility  using  analytical chromatography. As this method does not separate the forms with reduced potency, it is impossible to draw  any  firm  conclusions  whether  either  of  the  forms  could  be  superseding  the  other  in  the  final combination.

## Ground for Refusal 3

The binding affinity and interaction pattern of recombinant human PDGF to the human receptors and to the receptors in the animal species used for the pharmacology and toxicology studies as compared to human PDGF was not sufficiently clarified.

## · Company's response

A review of receptor binding data for human recombinant PDGF-BB both for human receptors and rat receptors  demonstrates  that  the  affinity  of  the  human  protein  is  similar  in  both  species.  As  previously stated the primary amino acid sequence of PDGF is highly conserved across species, with the lowest level of  amino  acid  identity  being  91%  comparing  the  rat  and  human  proteins  and  other  relevant  species

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

comparisons  having  higher  levels  of  identity  between  92-98%  that  of  human.  On  the  basis  of  the conservation  of  PDGF  sequence  across  species,  it  is  expected  that  the  binding  affinities  of  the  human PDGF protein  would  be  similar  for  receptors  on  cells  from  species  relevant  to  the  pivotal  toxicology studies discussed in the GEMESIS submission to EMEA. As requested by CHMP reviewers, the data in Table 1 summarize the available binding data for human PDGF, derived from recombinant sources, with receptors from human and rat.

Prior to the availability of purified recombinant PDGF-BB, binding studies were conducted using crude preparations of human PDGF purified from platelets when less was understood regarding the multiplicity of isoforms of the PDGF protein (i.e. AA, AB and BB) or that two receptors for PDGF existed. Since the preparations  used  in  these  studies  did  not  consist  of  homogeneously  purified  proteins,  there  is  greater variability in the data from one study to the next. However, if data are compared within a single study so that  a  single  PDGF preparation is compared against itself on multiple cell types from different species, there  is  value  in  showing  that  similar  binding  affinities  were  measured.  The  data  from  these  studies  is summarized  in  Table  2.  For  example,  the  study  conducted  by  Bowen-Pope  and  Ross  (1982)  included comparisons  of  binding  data  for  crude  human  PDGF  preparations  isolated  from  platelets  to  cells  from mouse, human and monkey (macaque) species. The binding data were similar (approximately 10 pM) for each of the cell lines tested, suggesting that the binding affinities of human PDGF across these species is very similar.

There are also a sizeable number of nonclinical studies published  that  demonstrate  the in  vitro and in  vivo activity  of  PDGF  for  osteoblasts,  osteoclasts,  and chondrocytes,  supporting  the  role  of  rhPDGF-BB  as  a  therapeutic  treatment  for  bone  regeneration  and repair in a variety of species. Along with dermal and bone tissue indications, Table 3 summarizes nonclinical studies that demonstrate the efficacy of human PDGF for eliciting biological responses in a wide variety of cells, tissues and organs in species used for toxicity testing. The literature is rich with examples of human recombinant PDGF eliciting biological responses in cells and tissues from mouse, rat, rabbit, dogs,  monkeys  and  other  species  that  support  using  them  as  relevant  analogs  to  humans  for  toxicity testing.

The data  from  the  literature  provided  demonstrate  the  range  of  binding  affinities  for  PDGF  to  human, mouse, rat, rabbit and monkey receptors on various cell types.  The binding affinity data vary depending on the preparation of PDGF used (recombinant or purified from human platelets), and the cell types or purified receptors under study.  In the majority of cases, the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) for human PDGF preparations binding to PDGF receptors, either purified or on human cells, range from 0.10 to 0.50 nM.  In comparison, Kd's for various species were 0.023 nM for rat liver cells, 0.10 nM for purified mouse PDGF receptors, and 0.20-0.80 nM for rabbit renal cells.  Thus, on the basis of apparent Kd's, the binding affinity of human PDGF for cells and receptors from pivotal species used for toxicology studies lie in a similar  range  to  those  of  human.    The  human  PDGF  preparation  evaluated  by  Bowen-Pope  and  Ross (1982) exhibited binding affinities  (Kd)  that  were  an  order  of  magnitude  lower  than  most  other  studies reporting this type of data.  In this study, human PDGF purified from human platelets bound to human cells with Kd's ranging from 0.0077 to 0.0108 nM compared to 0.0086 to 0.0122 nM for mouse cells and 0.017  nM for  monkey cells.    Considered  alone,  the  study  by  Bowen-Pope  and  Ross  demonstrated  that binding affinities of human PDGF for cells from pivotal animal species used for toxicity testing are very similar to those for PDGF receptors on human cells.

The  company  is  conducting  laboratory  studies  to  further  characterize  the  binding  of  yeast-derived rhPDGF-BB to cell lines from human, rat, mouse and rabbit to provide additional data in this regard. A report on the findings from these studies will be submitted to EMEA upon completion.

The  CHMP reviewers  have  requested  that  we  calculate  safety  margins  for  the  various  safety  data submitted in support of the approval of GEMESIS .  The maximum human clinical dose of GEMESIS is one (1) kit per patient, which is equivalent to a total dose of 0.15 mg of rhPDGF-BB.  For a patient having a mass of 70 kg, this is equivalent to a dose of 2.1 µg rhPDGF-BB per kg body weight.  As an example, the safety margin in the studies conducted to evaluate systemic toxicity in mice involved extraction  of  1.0  mg/ml  rhPDGF-BB  combined  with β -TCP  in  vehicles  such  as  0.9%  saline  or cottonseed  oil.    The  extraction  procedure  led  to  dilution  of  the  rhPDGF-BB  by  a  10-fold  factor yielding about 0.1 mg/ml rhPDGF-BB in the extracts.  Mice were dosed at 50 ml extract/kg body weight intraperitoneally and as a result they received a dose of rhPDGF-BB equivalent to 5 mg/kg body  weight.    Thus,  mice  received  a  dose  that  exceeded  the  maximum  human  clinical  dose  (2.1 µg/kg body weight) by approximately 2,381-fold for the evaluation of systemic toxicity.  This clearly represents  a  massive  dose  of  the  protein  especially  considering  that,  as  discussed  previously,  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

binding  affinity  of  human  PDGF  appears  to  be  similar  for  mouse  PDGF  cell-surface  receptors compared  to  human.    No  acute  toxic  outcomes  were  observed  in  the  mice  over  a  7  day  period following dosing in any of the studies conducted.  For some of the ISO 10993 studies submitted to EMEA to provide safety data for GEMESIS , extractions of the formulated product were conducted in a standard fashion that led to a final rhPDGF-BB concentration of approximately 0.1 mg/ml in the various extraction vehicles.

An exception to this included the procedure for conducting intramuscular implantations of rhPDGFBB combined with β -TCP in rabbits.  These studies were designed to implant the formulated product, undiluted, into four intramuscular sites in the paravertebral muscles of rabbits.  A total of 0.1 ml of 1.0 mg/ml rhPDGF-BB combined with β -TCP was implanted per IM site on each rabbit.  This was equivalent  to  implanting  approximately  50  µg  of  rhPDGF-BB  per  site  for  a  total  of  0.2  mg  per animal.  The animals had masses of about 4 kg each such that the dose received was 50 µg rhPDGFBB/kg body weight.  In comparison to the maximum clinical dose received by patients treated with GEMESIS (2.1  µg/kg),  the  dose  administered  to  rabbits  exceeded  the  maximum  human  dose  by approximately 24-fold.  The GEMESIS test article in these studies was evaluated histopathologically and found to be a slight irritant in comparison to controls 4 weeks after implantation.

Similarly, a neat preparation of 0.3 mg/ml rhPDGF-BB that had been aged for &gt;12 months at 30°C was injected  in  0.2  ml  aliquots  intracutaneously  and  paravertebrally  in  five  locations  in  rabbits  to evaluate the test article for dermal reactions.  Thus, a total of 0.3 mg of rhPDGF-BB was delivered to rabbits weighing approximately 4 kg.  The total dose delivered was, therefore, 75 µg/kg body weight which represents a dose exceeding the maximum  human  clinical dose for GEMESIS of approximately  36-fold.    The  conclusion  from  the  study  was  that  the  test  article  was  a  non-irritant following intracutaneous injection in rabbits.

Thus,  in  the  preclinical  studies  submitted  in  support  of  the  safety  of GEMESIS ,  there  was  a  large safety margin built into the studies to ensure the outcomes were relevant to humans.

## · CHMP conclusion

The Applicant has provided literature data on the binding properties of hPDGF onto receptors of several experimental species. Overall the binding affinity of hPDGF to receptors of rat, rabbit and dog seems to be very similar to that of binding to the human receptors. The source of PDGF and methods of binding analysis differ between the available literature data. However, when comparing data within each study the equivalent cross-species binding of hPDGF seems valid. Also, the Applicant is conducting studies to generate rhPDGF binding.

The applicant has provided literature data addressing the binding properties of rhPDGF to human and rat receptors. It is difficult to conclude based on the limited and variable data provided, maximal binding (nM 125 I-PDGF) and apparent dissociation constant (Kd, nM), from different assays.

The applicant has also provided published binding data for human PDGF with cells or crude receptor preparations  from  human,  mice  or  monkey  (macaque).  Only  one  study  including  different  species receptors (mouse, monkey and human) has been submitted (Bowen-Pope and Ross, 1982). Half-maximal binding values obtained were similar among species, and around 8 pM. However, it should be considered that the test item was purified human PDGF and not the rhPDGF under assessment in this procedure.

The applicant also provided literature references regarding human PDGF biological responses in a wide variety  of  cells,  tissues  and  organs  in  species  used  for  toxicity  testing.  However,  these  data  do  not specifically address the aforementioned concern. In addition, it should be considered that effects on the periodontium were mainly observed after co-administration of PDGF and IGF-1.

The applicant stated several assays were performed to specifically address the CHMP concern. However, the  only  information  provided  is  six  figures.  This  information  cannot  be  assessed  since  its  origin  is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

uncertain and the relevant study reports have not been submitted during the procedure. In addition, it remains unknown if human PDGF was also tested in these assays and if results from both substances were compared.

For  future  marketing  authorisation  applications  it  is  noted  that  the  issue  could  be  reconsidered  if  the applicant provides a) sufficient results of rhPDGF binding studies, b) full study reports of the 6 assays stated to have been performed to address the CHMP concern and c) an updated critical appraisal of these data, specifically addressing the CHMP concern.

In conclusion, the Applicant has shown that hPDGF has similar binding to human, rat, rabbit and dog receptors.  It  should  be  considered  that  the  test  item  was  purified  human  PDGF  and  not  the  rhPDGF under  assessment  in  this  procedure  and  therefore,  the  ground  for  refusal  has  not  been  sufficiently addressed.

## Ground for Refusal 4

Efficacy  has  not  been  demonstrated  for  the  proposed  indications  as  the  single  pivotal  trial  failed  the primary end point. The data from other phase II trials are insufficient to compensate for the deficiencies of the pivotal trial. In addition, the long term data showed that after 36 months the initial bone gain claimed with Gemesis as compared to the β -TCP matrix alone was no longer observed.

## · Company's response

The  Applicant  argues  that  the  body  of  evidence  demonstrates  the  clinical  safety  and  effectiveness  of Gemesis.  This  pivotal  trial  used  the  most  rigorous  and  sensitive  scientific  methods  available  for  large randomized clinical trials, to analyze the data which support these claims. The studies referenced provide the  highest  levels  of  evidence,  including  clinical,  radiographic,  and  histological  evidence  of  efficacy, which has not been demonstrated by other regenerative therapeutics. As such, the Company feels that the risk  to  benefit  profile  of  Gemesis is  favourable  and  warrants  strong  consideration  from  the  EMEA  for marketing approval.

## The applicant further states that:

Gemesis is an established, marketed combination product for the treatment of severe periodontal disease requiring regenerative procedures. This combination product has an excellent track record of safety and efficacy in its many years of commercial distribution in the U.S. and Canada.

Periodontal disease is a common and serious medical condition with an increasing prevalence with age. It can  be  debilitating  if  not  properly  treated  resulting  in  poor  nutrition  and  social  isolation.  There  is substantial  evidence  documented  in  published  papers  in  peer  reviewed  journals  that  severe  periodontal disease  may  increase  a  patient's  risk  for  coronary  artery  disease,  stroke,  bacterial  infections  including endocarditis, respiratory infections, diabetes, impaired fertility, premature births, low birth weight babies and preeclampsia. The condition requires improved treatment modalities and represents an unmet medical need. Further, there are currently no fully synthetic treatment options in the EU that have demonstrated the level  of  evidence  (i.e.  efficacy  and  safety)  as  Gemesis,  which  includes,  clinical,  radiographic,  and histological evidence of periodontal regeneration.

While  the  single,  pivotal  efficacy  trial  presented  in  the  application  for  marketing  authorisation  did  not demonstrate statistical efficacy for the designated primary efficacy endpoint of clinical attachment level at 24 weeks this endpoint is only one of several clinically reasonable surrogate endpoints for the definitive one of histological evaluation, which is not possible for large clinical trials such as this.

In addition to the Pivotal study, a long-term (12, 24 and 36 month) follow-up report of a subset of patients enrolled  in  the  Pivotal  study  was  completed  (Study  BMPI-2001-EXT),  and  as  well  as  five  additional

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

periodontal  study  reports  (BMPI-2002-01-Study  1;  BMPI-2003-01-  Study  3;  BMPI-2002-02-Study  4; BMPI-2002-02-Study 5; and Luitpold Study No. 1GEM04001).

It should be noted that while the CHMP has criticized the study for not achieving its primary endpoint, the Sponsor would like to point out that the primary endpoint of CAL gain was achieved at an earlier time point than expected (12 weeks) and thus a statistically significant improvement in CAL between baseline and 24 weeks was demonstrated. The pivotal study achieved statistically significant results for many other end points including secondary efficacy endpoints of linear bone growth at 24 weeks, percent bone fill at 24  weeks,  composite  effectiveness  using  CAL  and  LBG(%)  at  24  weeks  and  composite  effectiveness using CAL and BF(%) at 24 weeks. The significant results for LBG and BF indicate a strong regenerative promoting affect on bony tissue and the significant composite results indicate a clinically meaningful dual affect on soft and bony tissues. There was also a significant effect on wound healing at the 3 week time point which along with the positive result for CAL at 12 weeks and the significant affect on Area Under the Curve (AUC) for CAL indicate that GEMESIS accelerates the rate of tissue regeneration resulting in a better outcome more quickly. This enhancement of the healing and regenerative processes is a desirable effect which can mitigate the risk of infection and promote patient comfort and compliance with good oral hygiene, and has not been demonstrated by another synthetic product to date. In the extension study LBG was statistically superior in both active groups at 12, 24 and 36 months. BF was statistically superior in both  active  groups  at  12  and  24  months.  The  composite  endpoint  of  CAL  &amp;  LBG  achieved  statistical significance  at  12  months  (1  mg/mL  group),  at  24  months  (both  active  groups)  and  at  36  months  (0.3 mg/mL group). In addition, the composite result of CAL and BF showed numerically superior results at 12, 24 and 36 months. Finally, for the primary efficacy endpoint of CAL there were numerically superior results which increased in magnitude over time at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. These data support the longterm effectiveness of GEMESIS. It should be noted that while the other treatment groups continued to demonstrate improvements at later time points, this is an expected outcome, as the β -TCP control is CEmarked as a bone void filler and is commonly used to enhance periodontal repair. The assertion that the beneficial results of Gemesis were not sustained during the extension study does not seem to be supported by the actual data [cross ref data in dossier/responses].

The Gemesis pivotal trial is highly regarded by the medical professionals that specialise in treatment of periodontal disease. The trial is by far the largest randomized controlled clinical trial ever conducted on a grafting  material  in  periodontal  bone  defects.    The  difficulties  in  conducting  large  scale  periodontal clinical  studies  are  well  recognised,  meta-analysis  within  the  field  generally  includes  studies  with  an average sample-size of 20-30 patients.

In total, two hundred four (204) patients (212 treatment sites) received rhPDGF-BB in the Pivotal study and the five additional periodontal studies; 116 treatment sites received the Gemesis configuration (0.3 mg/mL rhPDGF-BB + β -TCP); 83 treatment sites received 1.0 mg/mL rhPDGF-BB + the Gemesis β -TCP; and 13 treatment sites received a combination of rhPDGF-BB + DFDBA (demineralised freeze-dried bone allograft) or DFDBA/Xenograft,  which  are  commonly  used  matrices  in  the  subject indications. Additionally, a study was conducted in Brazil (BPI-2000-01-Brazil) where 11 out of 15 treatment sites (in 9 patients) received 0.5 mg/mL-, 1.0 mg/mL- or 5.0 mg/mL- rhPDGF-BB combined with DFDBA. This was  the  initial  human  clinical  trial  utilising  rhPDGF-BB  to  treat  periodontal  defects  and  involved  the taking of human biopsies of jaw bone and gum tissue to assess on a cellular level the safety and efficacy of the product. This study is highly significant as it was the first time true periodontal regeneration had been demonstrated histologically using recombinant growth factor technologies. Except for BMPI-200301-Study 3, results of all of these studies have been published in internationally recognised peer-reviewed periodontal  journals.  Theses  periodontal  clinical  studies  are  previously  summarised  and  assessed,  see above.  In  addition,  data  from  seven  studies  using  0.3  mg/mL  rhPDGF-BB  for  orthopaedic  indications were provided to support the safety of Gemesis.

- CHMP conclusion

No additional analyses of the data were provided by the Applicant. The major clinical concern regarding the benefit-risk of Gemesis in the treatment of periodontically related defects remains.

The CHMP is of the opinion that the available data do not provide sufficient evidence of the efficacy of Gemesis in the treatment of the claimed indications. In a single pivotal study, results must be robust and consistent in order to support efficacy.

This view is based on:

The added benefit of the growth factor (0.3 mg/mL rhPDGF-BB), to the matrix ( β -TCP) is not considered sufficiently demonstrated.

- The primary endpoint, CAL gain at week 24 compared to controls, was not achieved in the single pivotal study.
- There is a lack of consistency in secondary endpoints.
- Only  two  (linear  bone  growth  (LBG)  and  %  bone  fill  (BF)  of  the  five  secondary  endpoints comparing  group  I  with  group  III  at  week  24  (wound  healing  was  assessed  three  weeks  post surgery) demonstrated statistical superiority for Gemesis.
- The  better  result  in  CAL  gain  in  the  test  group  demonstrated  at  3  months  post  surgery  is  not considered clinically relevant as this advantage of the addition of the growth factor did not sustain at 6 months or later.
- The rational for the selected becaplermin dose, 0.3 mg/mL is highly incomplete:
- o No specific dose-finding studies were performed.
- o The selected dose (0.3mg/ml) is not supported by the additionally submitted phase 2 studies. In all  three  phase  2  studies  comparing  two  concentrations  of  rhPDGF-BB  (0.3  mg/mL  and  1 mg/mL) in combination with β -TCP (Study 1, Study 3 and Study 5) the groups receiving the higher dose,  1.0 mg/mL rhPDGF-BB, performed numerically but not significantly better for the endpoint CAL gain compared to those receiving 0.3 mg/mL rhPDGF-BB. In addition, in study 1 regeneration was more pronounced in subjects receiving the higher dose, and in study 5 100% root coverage was achieved at 6 months for the 1.0 mg/mL treatment compared to 54% in subjects receiving 0.3 mg/mL.
- No significant difference between the test group and controls in wound healing three weeks post surgery could be demonstrated. This is a short term efficacy parameter of importance for patients' comfort and compliance with oral hygiene and risk of infection.
- Long-term follow-up data (up to 36 months) do not convincingly support any sustained benefit of the addition of the growth factor over the use of the matrix alone. Importantly, missing data was not taken into consideration in the assessment of long-term efficacy.
- Comparison with historical data is not considered sufficient to support weak results in the pivotal study.

Although the product seems to have a low rate of associated AEs, the safety database from controlled studies on the proposed indications is very small.

- Currently available safety data are deemed insufficient to justify a positive benefit - risk balance for Gemesis, due to the limited population of target patients exposed for Gemesis, the lack of longterm safety data and data on repeated use.
- Oral clarification during the BWP meeting on 9th November, 2009

During  the  oral  explanation  the  Applicant  presented  data  that  was  also  included  in  the  re-examination response package. No new information was provided concerning the level of forms with reduced potency in the Drug Product to demonstrate the comparability of the batches used in the clinical studies and those intended for commercial use. The Applicant confirmed that both beta-strands alter the 3D structure of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

PDGF molecule and thus reduces the capability of the molecule to bind its receptor. Glycosylation was not considered to be an issue for the activity of the PDGF molecule. During the discussion it was noted that the  level  of  forms  with  reduced  potency  in  the  final  product  could  be  reconsidered  if  the  clinical risk/benefit for such product is clearly positive and provided that the product is adequately controlled with regards to the product forms with reduced activity.

The BWP endorsed the conclusions drawn by the Rapporteur and the Co-Rapporteur. Based on the review of the quality grounds for re-examination and on the explanations given by the Applicant during the oral clarification in front of BWP, the BWP considers that the application for Gemesis is not approvable, as major  deficiencies  remain  precluding  a  recommendation  for  a  marketing  authorisation.  The  remaining major quality issues pertain to 1) the comparability of the materials produced for clinical studies and for commercial use and to 2) the uncontrolled level of the form with reduced potency in the final product and lack  of  demonstration  that  there  is  no  partition  effect  upon  interaction  with  the β TCP  component favouring the presence of the less potent forms.

## Views of the clinical ad hoc expert group on Gemesis

For the evaluation of the grounds for re-examination, the CHMP decided to consult an ad hoc expert group for Gemesis consisting of experts with expertise in the treatment of periodontally related defects. The ad hoc expert group met on 10 November 2009.

The group first discussed the List of Questions to be addressed by the experts. In relation to this, current clinical practice and issues when treating periodontally related defects were discussed.

The Applicant gave an oral clarification at the ad hoc expert meeting. The following questions were to be addressed by the Applicant in their presentation:

- Efficacy has not been demonstrated for the proposed indications as the single pivotal trial failed the primary end point. The data from other phase II trials are insufficient to compensate for the deficiencies of the pivotal trial. In addition, the long term data showed that after 36 months the initial bone gain claimed with Gemesis as compared to the β -TCP matrix alone was no longer observed.
- In relation to this, the following clinical issues should be  addressed:
- -Clinical relevance of different endpoints, in short-term and long-term perspectives, in particular:
- o The clinical relevance of the composite endpoints; Clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥ 2.67 mm plus linear bone growth (LBG) ≥ 1.1 mm; and CAL ≥ 2.67 plus % bone fill (BF) ≥ 14.1 mm, at 24 weeks post-surgery.
- o Importance of soft tissue related endpoints, such as gingival recession and wound healing.

The experts then discussed and concluded on their views on the major concerns. There was a consensus between experts to support the following clinical major concerns raised by the Rapporteurs in their Joint Assessment Report:

-The Rapporteur considers that, following review of the data provided, efficacy of Gemesis has not been convincingly  demonstrated  and  that  the  potential  benefits  of  the  addition  of  becaplermin  to β -TCP compared to the matrix alone were not justified by the submitted documentation. There is a lack of robust efficacy data and the clinical development plan is considered insufficient. This specifically relates to lack of consistency in primary and secondary endpoints and the weak rationale for the selected target dose.

## Overall conclusions on grounds for re-examination

## Quality issues

With their grounds for re-examination, the Applicant provided in writing data that they subsequently presented at an oral clarification meeting held on 9 November 2009.

The grounds for refusal relating to 1) the comparability of the materials produced for clinical studies and for commercial use and to 2) the level of rh-PDGF forms with reduced potency in the final product and the lack  of  demonstration  that  there  is  no  partition  effect  upon  interaction  with  the β -TCP    component favouring  the  presence  of  the  less  potent  forms  were  not  satisfactorily  addressed  by  the  Applicant  and therefore  remain.  It  is  noted  that  the  level  of  rh-PDGF  form  with  reduced  potency  in  the  final  product could be reconsidered if the clinical benefit/risk for such product is clearly positive and provided that the product is adequately controlled with regards to the product forms with reduced bioactivity.

## Non-clinical issue

The  Applicant  has  shown  that  hPDGF  has  similar  binding  to  human,  rat,  rabbit  and  dog  receptors. However,  the  test  item  was  purified  human  PDGF  and  not  the  rhPDGF  under  assessment  in  this procedure, and therefore the ground for refusal has not been sufficiently addressed.

## Efficacy issue

The rationale for Gemesis is based on the addition of a growth factor to a matrix in order to enhance its capacity for tissue regeneration which is considered clinically reasonable and supported by some of the preclinical models and in minor phase 2 studies. Histological evidence of true regeneration in humans has been provided for the association of becaplermin with β -TCP matrix, although no direct comparisons were made, i.e, β -TCP with or without becaplermin.

In the present application, efficacy of Gemesis has not been convincingly demonstrated. The single pivotal study failed its primary endpoint and there was an inconsistency in the outcomes of important secondary endpoints. The rationale for the selected dose is unclear and seems not to be supported by clinical data. Furthermore, long-term follow up data did not demonstrate any sustained benefit of Gemesis compared to the matrix alone.

## GROUNDS FOR REFUSAL

Whereas

- -The  comparability  of  product  used  in  clinical  studies  and  product  intended  to  be  placed  on  the market had not been demonstrated.
- -The  levels  of  forms  with  reduced  potency  in  the  active  substance/finished  product  are  not appropriately controlled. It has not been unequivocally demonstrated that there is no partition effect upon interaction with the β -TCP component favouring the presence of the less potent forms. It is noted  that  the  level  of  rh-PDGF  form  with  reduced  potency  in  the  final  product  could  be reconsidered  if  the  clinical  benefit/risk  for  such  product  is  clearly  positive  and  provided  that  the product is adequately controlled with regards to the product forms with reduced bioactivity.
- -The binding affinity and interaction pattern of recombinant human PDGF to the human receptors and  to  the  receptors  in  the  animal  species  used  for  the  pharmacology  and  toxicology  studies  as compared to human PDGF was not sufficiently clarified.
- -Efficacy of Gemesis has not been convincingly demonstrated. The potential benefits of the addition of  becaplermin  to β -TCP  compared  to  the  matrix  alone  were  not  justified  by  the  submitted documentation.  There  is  a  lack  of  robust  efficacy  data  and  the  clinical  development  plan  is considered  insufficient.  This  specifically  relates  to  lack  of  consistency  in  primary  and  secondary endpoints and the weak rationale for the selected target dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Due to the aforementioned concerns, a satisfactory summary of product characteristics, pharmacovigilance  system,  risk  management  plan  and  follow-up  measures  to  address  other concerns as outlined in the list of outstanding issues cannot be agreed at this stage.

The  benefit-risk  balance  of  Gemesis  cannot  be  considered  positive,  and  therefore  the  CHMP  has recommended the refusal of the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for Gemesis.

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Gemesis, that is intended for the following indications:

- For bone and periodontal regeneration in adult patients only.
- -To treat periodontally related defects, including:
- Intrabony/Infrabony periodontal defects; and
- Furcation periodontal defects; and
- Gingival recession associated with periodontal defects,

was unfavourable and therefore did not recommend the granting of the marketing authorisation.
