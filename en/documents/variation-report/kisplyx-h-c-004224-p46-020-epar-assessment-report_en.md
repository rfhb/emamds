## 1. Introduction

On 16 February 2024, the MAH submitted the final Clinical Study Report for Study E7080-G000-230 (hereafter referred to as Study 230), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. Study 230 is part of the clinical development program for Lenvatinib in the approved Paediatric Investigation Plan (EMEA-001119-PIP02-12-M08). The study was completed on 29 September 2023, which was the final database lock for the Study 230.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that selectively inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4), in addition to other proangiogenic and oncogenic pathway-related RTKs including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4, the platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor PDGFRα, KIT, and RET.

The marketing authorisations for Lenvima (EMEA/H/C/003727) and Kisplyx (EMEA/H/C/004224) were granted renewal on 20 May 2020 and 17 June 2021, respectively, including the indications for Lenvima of Differentiated  Thyroid  Carcinoma  (DTC),  Hepatocellular  Carcinoma  (HCC),  Endometrial  Carcinoma (EC) and the advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) for Kisplyx.

The MAH stated that Study E7080-G000-230 (hereafter referred to as 'Study 230') falls within the scope of the Paediatric Regulation; it is identified as Study 8 in the lenvatinib paediatric investigation plan (PIP 2: EMEA-001119-PIP02-12). Study 230 was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled, Phase 2 study in children, adolescents, and young adults ( ≤ 25 years) with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma. This study was completed on 29 September 2023, which was the final database lock for the study.

Within the clinical development scope of Lenvima /Kisplyx in paediatric setting, Study 230 and Study E7080-G000-207, (hereafter referred to as Study 207) are the main two clinical studies in EMEA-001119PIP02-12-M08.  A  Type  II  variation  was  submitted  to  the  Lenvima  license  on  16  June  2023 (EMEA/H/C/003727/II/0050)  to  update  sections  4.2,  4.8,  5.1  and  5.2  of  the  SmPC  with  paediatric information based on the results from Studies 207 and 230. CHMP gave the positive opinion on November 2023. Another Type II variation was submitted on November 2023 ((EMEA/H/C/003727/II/0055), also including the partial results from Study E7080-G000-207 (hereafter referred to as Study 207) and Study E7080-G000-230 (hereafter referred to as Study 230), as the part of the lenvatinib PIP (EMEA-001119PIP02-12-M08).

The second PIP EMEA001119-PIP03-19-M03 (condition: solid tumours) was approved on December 2023 and an additional Type II variation (variation category C.I.4) is submitted for both Lenvima and Kisplyx licenses to include the final results of the paediatric Study 230.

There are no plans to submit any extension of indications within the paediatric setting for lenvatinib as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy (ifosfamide and etoposide) for paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory DTC or osteosarcoma based on the submitted final CRS of Study 230 and thus no changes to the SmPC are proposed in this procedure.

The summary of the Study 230 is provided in the Table 1 below.

## 2.2. Clinical aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

This report includes the final CRS of study 230 for Lenvima and Kisplyx in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006. No extension of the indication is applied for and no modifications are proposed to the SmPC.

The MAH has submitted previously the reports for:

- E7080-G000-230: Phase 2 Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Lenvatinib in Combination with Ifosfamide and Etoposide versus Ifosfamide and Etoposide in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults with Relapsed or Refractory Osteosarcoma (OLIE): the primary CSR dated on 24 Jan 2023 and Revision 1 dated on 08 Jun 2023.

An integrated population PK analysis of lenvatinib was performed using pooled data from several studies including 4 studies in paediatric subjects: Study 207, Study E7080-G000-216, Study 230, and Study E7080-G000-231, and the PK report (CPMS-E7080-017R-v1) for details of the analysis and results was submitted in 2023.

- The biomarker analysis report for the Study 230 submitted in the type II variation (EMEA/H/C/003727/II/0050) with entitled TSBM-E7080-230-ANA-1R 'Biomarker Analysis of Lenvatinib (E7080) in a Multicenter, Open-label, Randomized Phase 2 Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Lenvatinib in Combination With Ifosfamide and Etoposide Versus Ifosfamide and Etoposide in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults With Relapsed or Refractory Osteosarcoma (OLIE)'

## 2.2.2. Methods

A Multicenter, Open-label, Randomized Phase 2 Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Lenvatinib in Combination with Ifosfamide and Etoposide versus Ifosfamide and Etoposide in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults with Relapsed or Refractory Osteosarcoma (OLIE)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Arm A = lenvatinib (LEN) + ifosfamide (IFO) + etoposide (ETO), Arm B = IFO + ETO (maximum of 5 cycles)

Subjects in Arm B with PD per Response Evaluation for Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 were eligible for optional treatment with lenvatinib ±chemotherapy. See Section 9.1.4 for further details. Follow-up occurred during the Randomization Phase (if subject discontinued treatment during the Randomization Phase), or during the Extension Phase, after termination of study treatment. Confirmation of PD by IIR was only required at the start of the Extension Phase.

C1 = Cycle 1, C5 = Cycle 5, Cx = nth cycle, D1 = Day 1, IIR = independent imaging review, PD = disease progression.

## Study participants

Key inclusion Criteria

- Male or female, at least 2 years and no more than 25 years of age at the time of informed consent
- Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of high-grade refractory or relapsed osteosarcoma
- One or 2 prior lines of systemic treatment
- Measurable or evaluable disease per RECIST 1.1
- Adequate bone marrow function, blood coagulation function, liver function, renal function, cardiac function, and blood pressure control
- Lansky play score or KPS score of at least 50.

Key exclusion Criteria

- Prior treatment with lenvatinib
- Clinically significant ECG abnormalities
- History of Grade 3 or higher ifosfamide-related nephrotoxicity or encephalopathy
- Any serious concomitant illness that in the opinion of the investigator(s) could have affected the subject's safety or interfered with the study assessments.

## Treatments

Arm A:  lenvatinib 14 mg/m2 (orally, once daily, in 21-day continuous cycles) plus ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2/day (intravenously [IV], Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 cycles) and etoposide 100 mg/m2/day (IV, Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 cycles)

Arm B:  ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2/day (IV, Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 cycles) and etoposide 100 mg/m2/day (IV, Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 cycles)

After adjustment for BSA, the dose of lenvatinib could not exceed 24 mg QD.  An extemporaneous suspension of lenvatinib capsules was used for subjects unable to swallow capsules.  After completion or discontinuation of ifosfamide and etoposide, treatment with lenvatinib could be continued as a single agent until PD or until another protocol-specified event occurred.

## Optional Lenvatinib Crossover (Subjects in Arm B Only):

Subjects in Arm B with PD based on RECIST 1.1 (per IIR in the Randomization Phase and per investigator assessment in the Extension Phase) were eligible for optional treatment with lenvatinib (± chemotherapy [maximum 5 cycles]), which could continue until subsequent PD (per investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1) or until another protocol-specified withdrawal criterion was met.

For the secondary endpoints, PFS rate at 4 months (PFS-4m) and at 1 year (PFS-1y) were defined as the percentage of subjects who were alive and without PD at 4 months and at 1 year, respectively, from the randomization date.  The PFS rates were estimated using the KM method.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

The study is open-label. However, Eisai's biostatistics and programming team, as well as the IIR reviewers of tumour assessments, were blinded.

Subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio stratified by time to first relapse/refractory disease (early [&lt;18 months] or late [ ≥ 18 months]) and age (&lt;18 years and ≥ 18 years).

## Statistical Methods

Full Analysis Set (FAS, intent-to-treat analysis) includes all subjects who were enrolled and randomly assigned to study treatment. Safety Analysis Set includes those subjects who received at least 1 dose of any study drug.

For this final synoptic CSR, cumulative disposition, exposure, and OS data are presented for the FAS as of the end of study (EOS; final database lock). Cumulative data for treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), including SAEs, as of the EOS are summarized for the Safety Analysis Set and for subjects from Arm B who crossed over to optional treatment with lenvatinib. The tables present cumulative data for the study (from the start of study treatment) while the listings present individual subject data from the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

time of data cutoff for the primary analysis until the EOS. The data are final as of the database lock date (29 Sep 2023).

## Results

The primary analysis was conducted at the primary data cutoff date (22 June 2022). The primary analysis sets for efficacy and safety were as follows:

- The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was defined as all subjects assigned to treatment regardless of the treatment actually received.
- The Safety Analysis Set was defined as subjects who received at least 1 dose of any study drug.

The FAS was the primary analysis set for the efficacy analyses and the Safety Analysis Set was the primary analysis set used for the safety analyses.

For the end of study (EOS) final analysis (database lock date: 29 Sep 2023), cumulative disposition, exposure, and OS data are presented for the FAS as of the end of study. Cumulative data for treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs), as of the EOS are summarized for the Safety Analysis Set and for subjects from Arm B who crossed over to optional treatment with lenvatinib.

## Recruitment

Study 230 was conducted between 22 Mar 2020 (first subject signed ICF) and 22 Jun 2022 (data cutoff date for primary analysis). The data are final as of the database lock date (29 Sep 2023). Subjects were enrolled at 44 study sites in 18 countries (3 regions).

In this study, 81 subjects (40 in Arm A, 41 in Arm B) were assigned to treatment and included in the FAS; 3 subjects (1 in Arm A and 2 in Arm B) did not receive any study drug and were excluded from the FAS. 78 treated subjects (39 in each arm) were included in the Safety Analysis Set.

As of the EOS, all 78 treated subjects had discontinued study treatment; ongoing subjects were transitioned to commercial lenvatinib (recorded on the case report form as 'treatment discontinued: reason, other').

As of the EOS, all 81 subjects in the FAS had withdrawn from the study. Fifty (61.7%) of the 81 subjects, 25 in Arm A and 25 in Arm B, had died and 10 subjects (12.3%), 4 in Arm A and 6 in Arm B, withdrew consent. For 18 subjects, survival follow-up ended when the sponsor terminated the study; the remaining 3 subjects transitioned to an access program using commercial lenvatinib. No subjects were lost to follow-up.

## The study was conducted in 3 phases:

- Pre-randomization Phase ( ≤ 28 days' duration for each subject): Consisted of Screening and Baseline periods, and established protocol eligibility.
- Randomization Phase : Consisted of Treatment and Follow-up periods. The Randomization Phase began at the time that the first subject was randomly assigned to treatment and ended on the data cutoff date for the primary analysis (22 Jun 2022).
- Extension Phase : After the data cutoff date for the primary analysis had occurred, all subjects still receiving study treatment entered the Extension Phase, which consisted of a Treatment and Follow-up period.
- The Follow-up Period (for both the Randomization and Extension Phases) began the day after the subject's Off-Treatment visit and lasted for up to 2 years after the subject's end of treatment, unless the subject met a protocol-specified withdrawal criterion.

## Optional Lenvatinib Crossover Treatment (Arm B Subjects)

Sixteen subjects in Arm B crossed over to optional lenvatinib treatment; 2 subjects did so after data cutoff for the primary analysis.

Eleven subjects crossed over after completing all 5 cycles of chemotherapy. The remaining 5 subjects crossed over during the chemotherapy period: 1 subject received no cycles of IFOS+ETOP with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lenvatinib, 1 subject received 1 cycle of IFOS+ETOP with lenvatinib, and 3 subjects received 2 cycles of IFOS+ETOP with Lenvatinib. All 16 subjects discontinued optional lenvatinib treatment as of the EOS; 11 of the 16 subjects (68.8%) due to PD. Of the 5 remaining subjects, 2 discontinued for an AE, and 1 each discontinued for subject choice, physician's decision, and transition to a managed access program for commercial Lenvatinib.

## Baseline data

Demographics and Disease characteristics

Demographics, baseline characteristics, and prior anticancer therapies are described in Study 230 primary CSR.

## Protocol Deviations

No major protocol deviations occurred between the cutoff date for the primary analysis and the EOS.

## Results

The median age of all subjects enrolled was 15.0 years, with 56 subjects (69.1%) aged less than 17 years. The median age of subjects at the time of first osteosarcoma diagnosis  was 13.5 years and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

12.0 years for Arm A and Arm B, respectively. Most subjects were white (n=50, 61.7%); 20 subjects (24.7%) were Asian, and 2 subjects (2.5%) were black. Most subjects had a Karnovsky Performance Status (KPS) or Lansky play score of 80 or above. Consistent with the known prevalence of osteosarcoma, there were more males (M) than females (F) (46M/35F) enrolled in the study; the proportion of males to females was greater in Arm A (25M/15F) than in Arm B (21M/20F). There were no other clinically relevant differences in baseline demographics between the treatment arms.

All subjects enrolled had relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma, 80 (98.8%) of which were high- grade (ie, Grade 3 or Grade 4). At Baseline, 64 subjects (79.0%) had lung lesions and 27 subjects (33.3%) had bone lesions per IIR.

Time to first relapse was less than 18 months for 70 subjects (86.4%), 35 in each arm. The median time from diagnosis of  metastatic disease to randomization was 9.5 months in Arm A and 6.0 months in Arm B.

All 81 subjects in the FAS had received at least 1 prior anticancer medication. The most frequently used prior anticancer medications were cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate. A total of 38 subjects (20 in Arm A, 18 in Arm B) had received prior ifosfamide and 22 (14 in Arm A, 8 in Arm B) had received prior etoposide; 14 subjects in Arm A and 7 subjects in Arm B had previously received both agents. Two subjects, both in Arm A, had received prior therapy with a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

## Efficacy results

All efficacy analyses were based on the FAS, which consisted of all subjects who were randomly assigned to treatment. The analyses of PFS and other secondary endpoints were performed at the primary DCO date of 22 Jun 2022. The analysis of the key secondary endpoint, OS, was also performed at EOS, final database lock date 29 Sep 2023.

9 subjects (22.5%) in Arm A and 18 subjects (43.9%) in Arm B had 1 or more baseline lesion(s) resected, including target and nontarget lesions. In the post hoc analysis excluding subjects who underwent lesion removal during the study (ie, those subjects who had been censored in the primary PFS analysis) from the analysis, median PFS was 6.3 months in Arm A and 2.9 months in Arm B (HR=0.42).

Six subjects in Arm A and 4 subjects in Arm B had a best overall response (BOR) of partial response (PR) (assessed by IIR in the FAS), for an ORR of 15.0% and 9.8%, respectively.

## Overall Survival at End of Study (EOS)

As of the EOS, there were 15 additional months of OS follow-up data after the primary analysis cutoff date. Median (95% CI) OS was 12.4 months (10.4, 19.8) in Arm A and 17.2 months (11.1, 22.3) in Arm B (stratified HR=0.93 [95% CI: 0.53, 1.62]; nominal P=0.3924).

Median follow-up time for the final OS analysis was 24.1 months (95% CI: 23.4, 27.5) for Arm A and 29.5 months (95% CI: 24.5, 32.3) for Arm B.

## Health-Related Quality of Life

The quality of life analysis set included 81 participants (41 participants randomized to Len+Ifo+Eto and 40 randomized to Ifo+Eto).The completion rates (at least 1 complete score) at the Off-Treatment Visit were 48.0% for Len+Ifo+Eto and 44.7% for Ifo+Eto.

Subjects in Arm A and Arm B had similar HRQoL scores.  For the generic questionnaire and cancer module, the total score did not differ significantly for Arm A and Arm B and did not reach the minimal threshold for clinically important differences.

The overall mean difference in HRQoL was not significant for any of the scales on the generic and cancer modules from Baseline to Week 18 using ANCOVA modelling.  Hazard ratios (HR) for time to first deterioration were not significant for any of the subscales of the generic and cancer modules.  A significant HR favoring Arm A over Arm B was observed for time to definitive deterioration for the communication scale of the cancer module (HR 0.15; 95% CI:  0.03, 0.78).  Hazard ratios for all other scales for both the generic and cancer modules were not significant for time to definitive deterioration (Module 5.3.5.1 Study 230 CSR Section 11.3.1.4.1).

## Palatability of Lenvatinib Suspension

Five subjects received lenvatinib as an oral suspension and completed the Palatability and Acceptability Questionnaire.  The overall acceptability of the lenvatinib suspension was rated as 'may be good or may be bad' by 2 subjects, 'good' by 2 subjects, and 'super good' by 1 subject (Module 5.3.5.1 Study 230 CSR Table 14.2.3.4.2).

The details are referred to the stand-alone Study 230 HRQoL report.

## Pharmacokinetic (PK)/Pharmacodynamic (PD) Results

An integrated population PK analysis of lenvatinib was performed using pooled data from several studies including 4 studies in paediatric subjects: Study 207, Study E7080-G000-216, Study 230, and Study E7080-G000-231 (CPMS-E7080-017R-v1).

Conclusions from the population PK analysis are:

- Lenvatinib oral clearance (CL/F) was affected by body weight.
- •
- In the presence of body weight effect, lenvatinib CL/F was not affected by age for subjects

aged 2 years or older.

- Dosing lenvatinib per BSA in children and adolescents resulted in a similar exposure to that in adults dosed at a fixed dose of 24 mg.
- Predicted exposure levels normalized by dose level were generally comparable between tumour types.

## Biomarker Analysis

No conclusive associations were observed between biomarkers and PFS or adverse events (AEs) in subjects treated with lenvatinib in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide. The pharmacodynamic changes observed in serum biomarkers (increased VEGF, FGF-19, and FGF-23, and decreased ANG-2) indicated that lenvatinib in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide had an inhibitory effect on the FGFR and VEGFR signaling pathways, consistent with the mechanism of action for lenvatinib and results of previous lenvatinib single agent clinical studies in adults and the paediatric population (Study 207) and in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide in osteosarcoma (Study 207). (Refer to TSBME7080-207-ANA-1R).

## Safety results

## Safety Results (Safety Analysis Set)

## Extent of Exposure

As of the EOS, 78 subjects (39 subjects in each arm) had received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included in the Safety Analysis Set. The median (minimum [min], maximum [max]) duration of treatment in Arm A was 35.71 weeks (5.9, 115.3), versus 33.14 weeks (5.9, 55.1) in the primary analysis.

Optional lenvatinib crossover (Arm B subjects only): Median (min, max) duration of lenvatinib treatment for the 16 subjects who crossed over to optional lenvatinib treatment was 51.8 weeks (11, 106).

## Ifosfamide and Etoposide Exposure

The exposure to ifosfamide or etoposide as of the EOS was unchanged relative to exposure as described in the Study 230 primary CSR.

## Lenvatinib Exposure

In general, the overall extent of exposure as of the EOS was longer relative to that described in Study 230 primary CSR. As of the EOS, median (min, max) duration of treatment in Arm A was 35.71 weeks (5.9, 115.3). Optional lenvatinib crossover (Arm B subjects only). Median (min, max) duration of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lenvatinib treatment for the 16 subjects who crossed over to optional lenvatinib treatment was 51.8 weeks (11, 106) .

## Ifosfamide and Etoposide Exposure

The exposure to IFOS and ETOP as of the EOS was unchanged relative to exposure as described in Study 230 primary CSR.

## Adverse Events

## Overview of Adverse Events

As of the EOS, 77 subjects (98.7%) experienced TEAEs. The most commonly reported TEAEs (incidence ≥ 40%) in Arm A as of the EOS were hypothyroidism (89.7%), anaemia (71.8%), nausea (59.0%), platelet count decreased (59.0%), proteinuria (59.0%), vomiting (48.7%), and hypertension (43.6%).

The most commonly reported TEAEs (incidence ≥ 30%) in Arm B as of the EOS were anaemia (69.2%), platelet count decreased (43.6%), nausea (41.0%), neutrophil count decreased (33.3%), and white blood cell count decreased (33.3%).

Adverse events reported for the 16 subjects in Arm B during optional lenvatinib crossover : As of the EOS, the most commonly reported TEAEs (incidence ≥ 35%) in these 16 subjects were hypothyroidism (50.0%), hypertension (43.8%), pain in extremity (37.5%), and proteinuria (37.5%).

## Deaths

As of the EOS, 49 subjects (62.8%; 24 in Arm A and 25 in Arm B) had died. Of these 49 deaths, 19 (9 in Arm A and 10 in Arm B) occurred after the cutoff for the primary analysis: 17 attributed to PD and 2 (both in Arm A) attributed to an AE.

The two Grade 5 AEs in Arm A were treatment-emergent pleural effusion and dyspnea in one and nontreatment-emergent cardiac metastasis in one patient.

One subject had a Grade 5 treatment-related TEAE, pneumonia, which occurred before the cutoff for the primary analysis.

Nonfatal Serious Adverse Events

As of the EOS, nonfatal treatment-emergent SAEs occurred in 50 subjects (64.1%), 30 in Arm A and 20 in Arm B. A total of 35 subjects (44.9%), 23 in Arm A and 12 in Arm B, had an SAE assessed as treatment-related by the investigator. Seven subjects (2 in Arm A and 5 in Arm B) had nonfatal SAEs after data cutoff for the primary analysis.

Data records occurring on or after the first dose date of the crossover are excluded from this table for subjects in Arm B (Ifosfamide 3000 mg/m² + Etoposide 100 mg/m²) who crossed over to optional treatment with lenvatinib +/- chemotherapy. MedDRA preferred terms \"Neoplasm progression\", \"Malignant neoplasm progression\" and\"Disease progression\" not related to the study drug are excluded.

Subjects with 2 or more treatment-emergent SAEs reported in the samePT are counted only once within that PT.

Adverse event terms are coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 25.0.

SAE =serious adverse event;PT =preferred term.

Other Significant Adverse Events

## Adverse Events Resulting in Treatment Discontinuation

As of the EOS, 13 subjects (16.7%; 10 in Arm A and 3 in Arm B) had a TEAE leading to discontinuation of any study drug; 6 subjects in Arm A discontinued lenvatinib. One subject in Arm A experienced a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

TEAE leading to discontinuation after the data cutoff for the primary analysis. One additional subject, in Arm B, experienced an AE leading to treatment discontinuation after data cutoff for the primary analysis, namely serious Grade 3 pulmonary embolism.

## Clinically Significant Adverse Events

As of the EOS, 54 subjects (69.2%) had a clinically significant event (CSE); 37 (94.9%) in Arm A and 17 (43.6%) in Arm B. A total of 22 subjects (56.4%) in Arm A and 4 subjects (10.3%) in Arm B had a CSE that was Grade ≥ 3; CSEs led to treatment discontinuation in 4 subjects, all in Arm A.

Pneumothorax is a known risk for lenvatinib in other tumour types; however, the observed incidence is numerically higher in patients with relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma treated with lenvatinib (see Study E7080-G000-207 [Single Agent] CSR and Study 230 primary CSR).

As of the EOS, 14 subjects (17.9%) had pneumothorax, 11 subjects in Arm A and 3 subjects in Arm B.

## Discussion

Study 230 is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 2 study of lenvatinib in combination with ifosfamide (IFOS) and etoposide (ETOP) (Arm A) versus IFOS plus ETOP (Arm B) in children, adolescents, and young adults with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma. E7080-G000-230 primary CSRs dated 24 Jan 2023 (Primary CSR) and 22 Jun 2023 (Primary CSR Revision 1) have been submitted previously. The MAH has provided in this submission the final CSR with the final database lock date of 29 Sep 2023. There are no plans to submit any extension of indications within the paediatric setting based on the results of this study.

The aim of the study was to evaluate whether lenvatinib in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide (Arm A) was superior to ifosfamide and etoposide alone (Arm B) in improving progression-free survival (PFS) based on independent imaging review (IIR) assessments using Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors v1.1 (RECIST 1.1), in children, adolescents, and young adults with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma. Secondary objectives included comparing the differences between the 2 treatment arms in PFS rate at 4 months and at 1 year per IIR, overall survival (OS) and OS rate at 1-year, objective response rate (ORR) and ORR at 4 months per IIR, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of lenvatinib when administered in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide. Subjects in Arm B (ifosfamide and etoposide), with PD per RECIST 1.1, had the option to crossover (within 30 days of documented disease progression) to treatment with lenvatinib (with or without ifosfamide and etoposide), which could continue until the next PD or until another protocol-specified withdrawal criterion was met.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the primary CRS of Study 230, the primary efficacy endpoint, PFS based on IIR assessments of tumour response was met. The secondary efficacy endpoints included PFS per IIR at 4 months (PFS4m) and at 1 year (PFS-1y), OS, and ORR assessed by IIR.

The primary endpoint, median PFS (per IIR) for the FAS, was 6.5 months (95% CI: 5.7, 8.2) in Arm A and 5.5 months (95% CI: 2.9, 6.5) in Arm B; hazard ratio (HR)=0.54 (95% CI: 0.27, 1.08), P=0.0396; the difference was not statistically significant (P value was predefined 1-sided type 1 error rate of 0.025).The Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimate of PFS-4m per IIR for the FAS was 76.3% for Arm A and 66.0% for Arm B, with a 1-sided P value of 0.168. The KM estimate of PFS-1y per IIR for the FAS (95% CI) was not estimable (NE) (NE, NE) in Arm A versus 14.9% (1.1, 44.5) in Arm B.

After discontinuing study treatment, 36 subjects (44.4%) received another anticancer medication, 15 (37.5%) in Arm A and 21 (51.2%) in Arm B. Of note, the higher use of posttreatment anticancer medications in Arm B probably had impact on the long-term clinical outcomes, such as OS.

At the time of the final OS analysis submitted with this application, no statistically significant difference between 2 arms indicated was observed. The OS was 12.4 months (10.4, 19.8) in Arm A and 17.2 months (11.1, 22.3) in Arm B (stratified HR=0.93 [95% CI: 0.53, 1.62]; nominal P=0.3924). The 95% CIs are overlapping. Median follow-up time for the final OS analysis was 24.1 months (95% CI: 23.4, 27.5) for Arm A and 29.5 months (95% CI: 24.5, 32.3) for Arm B. The OS curves do not show a clear trend and appear to cross at about 10 months. The subsequent anticancer treatment was a confounding factor for OS analysis during follow-up period. In addition, surgery was chosen as the subsequent treatment for 9 subjects (22.5%) in Arm A and 18 subjects (43.9%) in Arm B who had 1 or more baseline lesion(s) resected, including target and nontarget lesions. A post hoc analysis excluding subjects (ie, those subjects who had been censored in the primary PFS analysis) was performed: After excluding these patients who underwent lesion removal during the study from the analysis, median PFS was 6.3 months in Arm A and 2.9 months in Arm B (HR=0.42). Despite of 3.4 months benefit on median PFS in  Arm A over Arm B, no statistical significant difference was confirmed. Therefore, the overall results for the add-on of lenvatinib are not supportive and there is no clear sign of benefit, without demonstrating statistically significant differences, favourable or not.

TEAEs were generally manageable. As of the EOS, 77 subjects (98.7%) experienced TEAEs. The most commonly reported TEAEs (incidence ≥ 40%) in Arm A as of the EOS were hypothyroidism (89.7%), anaemia (71.8%), nausea (59.0%), platelet count decreased (59.0%), proteinuria (59.0%), vomiting (48.7%), and hypertension (43.6%). A total of 67 (85.9%) subjects had the Treatment Related TEAEs of  Grade  3  or  Higher  (36  (92.3%)  subjects  in  Arm  A  and  31  (79.5%)  subjects  in  Arm  B).  Nonfatal treatment-emergent SAEs occurred in 50 subjects (64.1%), 30 in Arm A and 20 in Arm B.

Overall, 49 subjects (62.8%; 24 in Arm A and 25 in Arm B) had died, and of 19 cases (9 in Arm A and 10 in Arm B) occurred after the cutoff for the primary analysis: 17 attributed to PD and 2 (both in Arm A) attributed to an AE. These two Grade 5 AEs were treatment-emergent pleural effusion, dyspnoea and non-treatment-emergent  cardiac  metastasis.  One  subject  had  a  Grade  5  treatment-related  TEAE, pneumonia, which occurred before the cutoff for the primary analysis. Only the narrative of one fatal case (not related to the disease progression) after the cutoff for the primary analysis was provided, the MAH should provide the missing narratives.

## The MAH should include the final OS results for the Study 230 in the SmPC section 5.1.

Overall, 13 subjects (16.7%; 10 in Arm A and 3 in Arm B) had a TEAE leading to discontinuation of any study drug; 6 subjects in Arm A discontinued lenvatinib. Clinical laboratory data, vital sign and ECG data, physical examination findings, and other observations related to safety did not reveal any new safety signals.  The  safety  profile  of  lenvatinib  in  combination  with  ifosfamide  and  etoposide  remained unchanged at the EOS since the primary analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pneumothorax is a known complication of osteosarcoma, specifically in patients with pulmonary metastases and has been reported for tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including lenvatinib, and in patients receiving chemotherapy for osteosarcoma. As of the EOS, 14 subjects (17.9%) had pneumothorax, 11 subjects in Arm A and 3 subjects in Arm B . The observed incidence of pneumothorax is likely associated with the subjects' underlying osteosarcoma and presence of lung metastases. Most events of pneumothorax were managed by the medical support care, and/ or dose modifications of study agents. This ADR is reflected in the SmPC for paediatric population (' In Study 230, pneumothorax was reported in 12 patients (11 patients [28.2%] treated with lenvatinib plus ifosfamide and etoposide, and 1 patient [2.6%] treated with ifosfamide and etoposide' ), but the results should be updated with the final data cut-off.

Overall, the safety profile of lenvatinib plus chemotherapy in this study is consistent with the known toxicity profiles of the individual agents. The AE profile for lenvatinib was overall as expected for this class of compound and consistent with the current lenvatinib SmPC and the clinical program as a whole. Similarly, the AE profiles of ifosfamide and etoposide were consistent with their known safety profile.

## 3. First request for supplementary information

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions (other concerns) as part of this procedure:

- 1) The MAH should include the final OS results for the Study 230 in the SmPC section 5.1.
- 2) The results for pneumothorax cases should be updated in the SmPC with the final data cut-off.
- 3) Only the narrative of one fatal case (not related to the disease progression) after the cutoff for the primary analysis was provided, the MAH should provide the missing narratives.

The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop.

## 4. MAH responses to First request for supplementary information

## MAH responses to First request for supplementary information

## Question 1

The MAH should include the final OS results for the Study 230 in the SmPC section 5.1.

## Response

The MAH acknowledges the agency's request; however, proposes not to include the final OS results from Study 230 in Section 5.1 of the Lenvima SmPC given that the study was not designed or powered to test for a difference in OS between the 2 treatment arms. In addition, OS was impacted by the greater proportion of subjects who had baseline tumour lesions surgically resected during the study in Arm B (ifosfamide plus etoposide; 43.9%) versus Arm A (lenvatinib plus ifosfamide plus etoposide; 22.5%) and by the greater use of subsequent anticancer medications in Arm B (51.2%) versus Arm A (37.5%), and therefore would not be informative to the prescribers (please refer to Section 11.3.1.2.2 of the Study 230 Primary CSR, dated 08 June 2023; submitted under Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/003727/II/0050).

Furthermore, given that the study did not meet its primary endpoint of PFS, and no paediatric indication for lenvatinib was supported by the results of Study 230, the MAH considers that inclusion of the descriptive final OS results in the Lenvima SmPC is not warranted. Please note, clinical data from studies conducted in the paediatric population, including Study 230, have been included in Section 5.1 of the Lenvima SmPC, as part of the Type II variation (Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/003727/II/0050), which received positive CHMP opinion on 09 Nov 2023.

## Assessment

The MAH does not to add the final OS data the of Study 230 in the section 5.1 of SmPC. Despite of several confounding factors, both the comprehensive efficacy and safety results are of relevance for inclusion in the SmPC.

The MAH should include the final OS results for the Study 230 in the SmPC section 5.1.

## Conclusion

## Issue was not resolved

The MAH should include the final OS results for the Study 230 in the SmPC section 5.1 and is requested to submit the proposal for the amended SmPC section 5.1 before implementation along with the agreed changes in the section 4.8 regarding the pneumothorax cases at the final data cut-off for Study 230 (see also Question 2).

Following the assessment report, the following statement was agreed for inclusion in the section 5.1:

'Study 230 was not powered to detect a statistically significant difference in OS. At the end of study analysis, the HR was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.62) for the comparison of lenvatinib in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide versus ifosfamide and etoposide, with median OS 12.4 months (95%CI 10.4, 19.8) versus 17.2 months (95%CI 11.1, 22.3), respectively and median follow-up time 24.1 months and 29.5 months, respectively.'

## Conclusion

## Issue resolved

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Question 2

The results for pneumothorax cases should be updated in the SmPC with the final data cut-off.

## Response

The MAH agrees to update the Lenvima SmPC Section 4.8 with the results for pneumothorax cases based on the final data cutoff for Study 230.

The MAH proposes the following updated text highlighted in red.

## Assessment

The MAH proposes the update regarding the pneumothorax cases based on the final data cutoff for Study 230 in the section 4.8 of Lenvima SmPC as requested. However, the updated version of the SmPC has not been submitted.

## Conclusion

## Issue resolved

## Question 3

Only the narrative of one fatal case (not related to the disease progression) after the cutoff for the primary analysis was provided, the MAH should provide the missing narratives.

## Response

As discussed further with the EMA, it was clarified on 18 April 2024, that the missing narrative requested, relates  to  a  Subject.  The  narrative  for  this  subject,  who  had  discontinued  treatment  due  to  disease progression,  was  provided  in  the  primary  clinical  study  report  (CSR).  This  narrative  has  now  been updated with information on the death due to metastases to heart (Day 527), which was not treatment emergent (see the last paragraph in the narrative).

## Assessment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The applicant provided the detailed information on the missing narrative of the fatal case as requested. This patient had discontinued treatment due to disease progression and the narrative has now been updated with information on the death due to metastases to heart at Day 527, 199 days after the last dose of lenvatinib, 461 days after the last dose of etoposide and ifosfamide. The Investigator considered the event serious and not related to the study drugs, the causality assessment has not been further discussed by the MAH.

## Conclusion

Issue not pursued.

## 5. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

The data from the final CRS of Study 230 further inform on the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in combination with chemotherapy in osteosarcoma patients with longer follow-up. The MAH should include the final OS results for the Study 230 in the SmPC section 5.1. No extension of the indication is proposed in this procedure, this is supported.

Pneumothorax is noticeable as AE and has been reported for other tyrosine kinase inhibitors and in patients receiving chemotherapy for osteosarcoma, and appears to be mainly associated with pulmonary metastases and underlying osteosarcoma. The results for pneumothorax cases should be updated in the SmPC with the final data cut-off. The safety profile of lenvatinib in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide remained unchanged at the EOS since the primary analysis. It's notable that more toxicities were reported in Arm A probably due to the adding-on lenvatinib treatment, leading to uncertainty on its benefit risk profile.

## Fulfilled:

In view of the available data regarding Study 230, the MAH should either submit a variation in accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or provide a justification for not doing so. This should be provided without any delay and no later than 60 days after the receipt of these conclusions.

## Not fulfilled:

## 6. Conclusion

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should update the SmPC and implement the following changes in the coming type IB procedure:

- 1) Inclusion of the OS analysis results for the study 230 in the section 5.1:

'Study 230 was not powered to detect a statistically significant difference in OS. At the end of study analysis, the HR was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.62) for the comparison of lenvatinib in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide versus ifosfamide and etoposide, with median OS 12.4 months (95%CI 10.4, 19.8) versus 17.2 months (95%CI 11.1, 22.3), respectively and median follow-up time 24.1 months and 29.5 months, respectively.'

- 2) Update the number of pneumothorax cases in the section 4.8:

'In Study 230, pneumothorax was reported in a total of 14 patients (11 patients (28.2%) treated with lenvatinib plus ifosfamide and etoposide, and 3 patients (7.7%) treated with ifosfamide and etoposide).'
