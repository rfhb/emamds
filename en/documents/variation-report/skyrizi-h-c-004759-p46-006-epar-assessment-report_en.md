## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final study report for:

M16-813  A  Phase  2,  Multicenter,  Randomized,  Placebo-  Controlled,  Double-Blind  Study  to  Evaluate Risankizumab in Adult and Adolescent Subjects with Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Study M16-813

## Description

Study  M16-813  was  a  Phase  2,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  multicentre  study  to evaluate the safety and efficacy of risankizumab for the treatment of moderate to severe AD in adult and  adolescent  subjects  with  onset  of  symptoms  at  least  2  years  before  the  Baseline  Visit.  The duration of the study was up to 65 weeks and included a screening period of up to 35 days, a 16-week double-blind treatment period (Period A), a 36-week double-blind treatment period (Period B), and a safety phone call approximately 20 weeks after the last dose of study drug. The primary analysis was performed  when  all  subjects  completed  Week  16.  Eligible  subjects  were  randomized  at  Baseline  to receive  risankizumab  150  mg,  risankizumab  300  mg,  or  matching  placebo  (2:2:1,  respectively)  at Week 0 and Week 4 of Period A. In Period B, subjects in the placebo group were re-randomized at Week 16 in a 1:1 ratio to receive either risankizumab 150 mg or 300 mg for the remainder of the study. Subjects originally randomized to risankizumab 150 mg or 300 mg in Period A stayed on their previously assigned treatment through the end of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All subjects received risankizumab at the Week 16, Week 28, and Week 40 visits. The last visit to the study  site  occurred  at  Week  52.  Subjects  had  a  final  follow  up  call  20  weeks  after  the  last  dose administration. During Period B, subjects with less than 50% reduction from Baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (&lt; EASI 50) were allowed to begin approved concomitant rescue treatment. Rescue treatment was limited to up to twice-daily application of topical corticosteroids.

## Methods

## Objective(s)

The following primary and key secondary objectives were evaluated:

- Primary endpoint: proportion of subjects achieving at least a 75% reduction from Baseline in EASI (EASI 75) at Week 16;
- Key  secondary  endpoint:  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  validated  Investigator  Global Assessment Scale for Atopic Dermatitis of \"0\" or \"1\" (on a 5-point scale) with a reduction from Baseline of ≥ 2 points at Week 16;
- Key secondary endpoint: proportion of subjects achieving a reduction of ≥ 4  points  in  worst pruritus numerical rating scale from Baseline to Week 16.

## Study population /Sample size

The intent-to-treat population consisted of 172 subjects who were randomized in Study M16-813. All randomized subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug in Study M16-813. Of all subjects, 55.8% were male, 53.5% were white, and the median age was 42.5 years (14 years min and 83 years max age).  The  median  EASI  (overall  score)  at  Baseline  was  26.80  (range:  16.0,  72.0),  indicative  of  a population with moderate to severe AD disease activity.

## Key inclusion/exclusion criteria

Eligible subjects were adults who were ≥ 18  years  old and, where locally permissible and approved, adolescent subjects who were at least 12 years old. Subjects must have had:

- Diagnosis of AD with onset of symptoms at least 2 years prior to Baseline.
- Moderate to severe AD at the Baseline Visit, defined by Eczema Area and Severity Index ≥ 16, body surface area (BSA) ≥ 10%, and validated Investigator Global Assessment Scale for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) score of ≥ 3.
- History of inadequate response to previous topical corticosteroid and/or topical calcineurin inhibitor treatments or a medical inability to receive these treatments.

Subjects with prior exposure to any biologic immunomodulatory agent or Janus kinase inhibitor were excluded from the study. Concurrent treatment with systemic therapy that can also be used for the treatment of AD (biologic or non-biologic), as well as use of topical and/or phototherapy treatments, was prohibited throughout the study.

## Treatments

## Period A (Baseline up to Week 16)

Study  site  staff  administered  study  drug;  risankizumab  75  mg/0.83  mL  (90  mg/mL)  injected subcutaneously (SC) as risankizumab 150 mg (2 × 75 mg pre-filled syringe (PFS) and 2 × placebo

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

PFS), risankizumab 300 mg (4 × 75 mg PFS) or matching placebo (4 x placebo PFS) at Week 0 and Week 4.

## Period B (Week 16 up through Week 52)

Study  site  staff  administered  either  a  risankizumab  150  mg  or  risankizumab  300  mg  dose subcutaneously at the Week 16, 28, and 40 visits.

## Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Endpoints

Serum  risankizumab  concentrations,  anti-drug  antibodies  (ADA),  and  neutralizing  antibodies  (nAb) were determined from blood collected by venipuncture at scheduled visits.

## Statistical Methods

Efficacy: Pairwise  comparison  of  the  primary  endpoint  and  the  key  secondary  endpoints  was conducted between each risankizumab group (risankizumab 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively) versus the  placebo  group  using  the  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test,  stratified  by  baseline  disease  severity (moderate [vIGA-AD 3] versus severe [vIGA-AD 4]). For the analysis of the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints, non-responder imputation (NRI) with multiple imputation to handle missing data due to COVID-19 (NRI-C) was used as the primary approach. Efficacy data for subjects who switched to rescue medications was imputed from the point of rescue using an NRI approach for the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints.

Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity : Serum risankizumab concentrations were summarized at each sampling time point for each dose group using descriptive statistics. ADA titres were tabulated for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

each subject at the respective study visits. The number and percentage of subjects with ADA and NAb were calculated by dose group.

Safety: All  safety  analyses  were  performed  on  the  Safety  Population  for  both  treatment  periods, respectively,  as  well  as  the  All  Risankizumab  Treated  population,  based  on  the  treatment  subjects actually received. Safety was assessed by AEs, laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG variables. Missing safety  data  was  not  imputed  for  safety  analysis.  AEs  were  coded  using  Medical  Dictionary  for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA). A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an AE with onset or worsening on or after the first dose of study drug and within 140 days (20 weeks) after the last dose of study treatment injection. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing TEAEs was tabulated using MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term, as well as by severity and by  relationship  to  the  study  drug  as  assessed  by  the  investigator.  Summaries  (i.e.,  number, percentages, and events per 100 patient-years) of TEAEs, SAEs, deaths, AEs leading to discontinuation,  and  areas  of  safety  interest  were  provided.  Pre-treatment  AEs  were  summarized separately.

For laboratory test and vital signs variables, mean change from baseline and percentage of subjects with evaluations meeting criteria for pre-defined Potentially Clinically Significant values were summarized.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 172 subjects were randomized in this study. Twenty-eight subjects (16.3%) discontinued the study  in  Period  A.  The  most  common  primary  reason  for  study  discontinuation  in  Period  A  was withdrawal of consent. Seventy-three subjects (50.7%) discontinued the study in Period B. The most common primary reason for study discontinuation in Period B was \"other,\" including 43 subjects who discontinued the study due to the early termination of the study by the Sponsor. Seventy-one subjects (49.3%) completed the study.

Study M16-813 did not meet the primary endpoint, the proportion of subjects achieving at least a 75% reduction from Baseline in EASI (EASI 75) at Week 16 (table above). Neither risankizumab 150 mg nor risankizumab 300 mg showed a statistically significantly greater percentage of subjects achieving an EASI 75 response at Week 16 compared with the placebo group.

## CHMP comments

The primary endpoint, the proportion of subjects achieving EASI 75 at Week 16, was not met. Neither risankizumab 150 mg nor risankizumab 300 mg showed a statistically significantly greater percentage of subjects achieving an EASI 75 response at Week 16 compared with the placebo group. Secondary endpoints,  (the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  IGA-AD  of  \"0\"  or  \"1\"  (on  a  5-point  scale)  with  a reduction from Baseline of ≥ 2 points at Week 16 and the proportion of subjects achieving a reduction of ≥ 4 points in worst pruritus numerical rating scale from Baseline to Week 16) were also not met. The MAH has outlined that the indication of AD will not be further pursued.

Immunogenicity of risankizumab was assessed using a 3-tiered approach. In this tiered approach, all ADA  samples  were  first  analysed  in  a  screening  assay  (Tier  1).  The  samples  that  were  screened positive  were  confirmed  in  the  confirmatory  assay  (Tier  2)  followed  by  the  titre  determination  step (Tier  3)  in  which  titres  were  determined  for  the  confirmed  positive  samples.  The  confirmed  positive samples  were  also  evaluated  in  the  NAb  assay  to  detect  the  presence  of  NAb.  Incidence  of  ADAs (treatment-emergent) to risankizumab was defined when a subject was (1) ADA-negative or missing assessment at Baseline and became ADA-positive at 1 or more time points post Week 0 visit in this study, or (2) ADA-positive at Baseline and showed a 4-fold or greater increase in titer values relative to Baseline.

The summary of treatment-emergent ADAs and NAbs to risankizumab in subjects who received at least 1 dose of risankizumab during the study duration (52 weeks) is presented in Table 5.

As shown in Table 6, the geometric mean serum risankizumab concentrations in ADA-positive subjects appeared to be lower than that of ADA-negative subjects. Only 2 subjects developed NAb at Week 16 and Week 52 in the risankizumab 150 mg treatment arm and 1 subject developed NAb at Week 16 in risankizumab 300 mg treatment arm, resulting in risankizumab exposures within the range of NAbnegative subjects in the same treatment arms. Given the limited number of subjects who developed ADA and/or NAb, these data should be interpreted with caution. None of the subjects switching from placebo  to  risankizumab  150  mg  SC  or  risankizumab  300  mg  SC  treatment  arms  at  Week  16 developed ADA at Week 52.

Similar proportions of ADA-positive and ADA-negative subjects achieved the primary efficacy endpoint in the risankizumab 150 mg treatment arm (28.6% versus 25.9%), but in the risankizumab 300 mg treatment arm, a higher proportion of ADA-positive subjects achieved the primary efficacy endpoint (42.9% vs. 20.7%) (Table 7). However, these data should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of subjects who developed ADA and NAb.

## CHMP comments

The incidence of the ADA and NAb to risankizumab in M16-813 across the study duration of weeks 0 to 52 (ADAs in 10.9% or 15/138 of evaluable subjects and NAbs in 4 subjects (2.9%) is lower than those observed in phase 3 trials which made up the plaque psoriasis development programme (where the anti-drug  antibody  and  NAb  incidence  to  risankizumab  150mg  at  Week  0,  Week  4,  and  q12w thereafter) was 19% and 8%, respectively over 16 weeks duration (based on 1288 evaluable subjects) and 24% and 14% respectively over 52 weeks duration).

Whereas  the  presence  of  neutralizing  antibodies  (NAb)  to  risankizumab  was  not  correlated  with risankizumab clearance in the psoriasis programme, the risankizumab concentrations in ADA-positive subjects treated in M16-813 appeared to be lower than that of ADA-negative subjects though similar proportions of ADA-positive and ADA-negative subjects achieved the primary efficacy endpoint in the risankizumab 150 mg treatment arm (28.6% versus 25.9% and in fact in the risankizumab 300 mg treatment arm, a higher proportion of ADA-positive subjects achieved the primary efficacy endpoint (42.9% vs. 20.7%).

It is agreed however that the low numbers of subjects who developed ADA and/or Nab mean that all these findings should be interpreted with caution and the impact of immunogenicity on risankizumab exposure and efficacy cannot be adequately assessed from these data.

## Safety results

The safety population in Period A was defined as all subjects who were randomized at baseline and received at least 1 dose of study drug in Treatment Period A. The safety population in Period B was defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Treatment Period B. Subjects were assigned to a treatment group based on the treatment actually received. The All Risankizumab Treated population consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of risankizumab in the study. This population was used to provide a comprehensive summary of safety. Mean extent of exposure for the All Risankizumab Treated population was 272.4 days (SD, 104.76).

A summary of Adverse Events experienced by patients in period A is presented below in Table 9.

Notes: Placebo: Subjects randomized at Baseline and received placebo in Peniod A. RZB 150 mg: Subjects randomized at Baveline and received risankizumub 150 mg in Period A RZB 300 mg: Subjects randomized at Baseline and received risankizumab 300 mg in Penicd A. Subjects were coumted once in each row, regardlews of the numbar of events they msy have had. For subjects who did not enter Period B, TEAEs were defined as any event with an onset or worsening date on or after the finst dose of study drug and no more than 140 days after the lst dose of study drug. For subjecls who entered Peniod B, TEAEs were defined as any event with an onset or worsening date on or after the fiust dose of study dhug in Peniod A and before the fist dose of study dug in Period B.

Three subjects (8.8%) in the placebo group experienced SAEs; no SAEs were experienced by subjects in the risankizumab 150 mg or 300 mg treatment groups. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study  drug  were  reported  in  4  subjects  (5.8%)  in  the  risankizumab  150  mg  treatment  group,  2 subjects (2.9%) in the risankizumab 300 mg treatment group, and 7 subjects (20.6%) in the placebo group. There was 1 treatment-emergent death during Period A of a subject in the placebo group.

A summary of Adverse Events experienced by patients in period B is presented below in Table 10.

In Period B, a total of 142 subjects (13 subjects in the placebo to risankizumab 150 mg treatment group,  11  subjects  in  the  placebo  to  risankizumab  300  mg  treatment  group,  61  subjects  in  the risankizumab 150 mg treatment group, and 57 subjects in the risankizumab 300 mg treatment group) received at least one dose of study drug. Six subjects (46.2%) in the placebo/ risankizumab 150 mg treatment  group,  5  subjects  (45.5%)  in  the  placebo/  risankizumab  300  mg  treatment  group,  29 subjects  (47.5%)  in  the  risankizumab  150  mg  treatment  group,  and  29  subjects  (50.9%)  in  the risankizumab  300  mg  treatment  group  experienced  at  least  1  AE.  Two  subjects  (15.4%)  in  the placebo/ risankizumab 150 mg treatment group, 2 subjects (18.2%) in the placebo/ risankizumab 300 mg  treatment  group,  10  subjects  (16.4%)  in  the  risankizumab  150  mg  treatment  group,  and  3 subjects (5.3%) in the risankizumab 300 mg treatment group experienced treatment-emergent AEs with a reasonable possibility of being drug-related, as assessed by the investigator. No subjects in the placebo/  risankizumab  150  mg  treatment  group  or  the  placebo/  risankizumab  300  mg  treatment groups, 2 subjects (3.3%) in the risankizumab 150 mg treatment group, and 3 subjects (5.3%) in the risankizumab 300 mg treatment group experienced SAEs. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study  drug  were  reported  in  2  subjects  (15.4%)  in  the  placebo/  risankizumab  150  mg  treatment group, no subjects in the placebo/ risankizumab 300 mg treatment group, 2 subjects (3.3%) in the risankizumab 150 mg treatment group, and no subjects in the risankizumab 300 mg treatment group. There were no treatment-emergent deaths during Period B.

In the All Risankizumab Treated population, 112 subjects (69.1%) experienced at least 1 AE, including 57  subjects  (69.5%)  treated  with  risankizumab  150  mg  and  55  subjects  (68.8%)  treated  with risankizumab  300  mg  (Table  11).  Thirty-two  subjects  (19.8%)  experienced  AEs  with  a  reasonable possibility of being drug-related as assessed by the investigator, including 17 subjects (20.7%) treated with risankizumab 150 mg and 15 subjects (18.8%) treated with risankizumab 300 mg. Five subjects (3.1%)  experienced  SAEs,  including  2  subjects  (2.4%)  treated  with  risankizumab  150  mg  and  3 subjects (3.8%) treated with risankizumab 300 mg.

Notes:

RZB 150 mg: Subjects received at least 1 dose of risankizumab 150 mg during the study RZB 300 mg: Subjects received at least 1 dose of risankizumab 300 mg during the study. Subjects were counted once in each row, regardless of the number of events they may have had TEAEs were defined as any event with an onset or worsening date on or after the first dose of risankizumab and no more than 140 days after the last dose of risankizumab in the study.

## Adverse events leading to discontinuation

Adverse  events  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug  were  reported  by  10  subjects  (6.2%), including  8  subjects  (9.8%)  treated  with  risankizumab  150  mg  and  2  subjects  (2.5%)  treated  with risankizumab 300 mg. No treatment-emergent deaths occurred in subjects treated with risankizumab during the study.

## Adverse Events Related to Areas of Safety Interest

## Adjudicated Cardiovascular Events

No subjects experienced treatment-emergent adjudicated cardiovascular (CV) events.

## Hypersensitivity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A treatment-emergent hypersensitivity reaction was experienced by 1 subject (2.9%) in the placebo group (dermatitis atopic) and no subjects receiving risankizumab treatment throughout this study.

## Infections

In the All Risankizumab Treated population, 2 (1.2%) subjects experienced a treatment-emergent serious infection, with cellulitis being the only reported PT. No events of serious infection led to study drug discontinuation. In the All Risankizumab Treated population, 2 (1.2%) subjects experienced an opportunistic infection excluding TB and herpes zoster, with cellulitis and Kaposi's varicelliform eruption being the only reported PTs. No events in this category led to study drug discontinuation.

## Malignancies

In  the  All  Risankizumab  Treated  population,  2  subjects  (2.4%)  experienced  at  least  1  treatmentemergent malignancy, including 1 event of neoplasm and 1 event of Bowen's disease. Neither event was serious. Neither event in this category led to study drug discontinuation.

## Hepatic Events

In  the  All  Risankizumab  Treated  population,  4  subjects  (2.5%)  experienced  at  least  1  treatmentemergent hepatic event, with ALT increased being the most commonly reported (&gt; 2 subjects) PT (3 subjects;  1.9%).  None  of  the  events  were  serious.  No  events  in  this  category  led  to  study  drug discontinuation.

## Discussion on Paediatric Data

Study M16-813 enrolled 3 paediatric patients. The first paediatric subject was randomized to receive risankizumab 150 mg. The subject completed all dosing up to the Week 28 visit and was discontinued when the study was terminated by the sponsor. There were no AEs reported for this subject.

The  second  paediatric  subject  had  a  history  of  food  allergies  (allergic  to  peanuts  since  2015  and allergic  to  seafood  since  2010)  was  randomized  to  receive  risankizumab  300  mg.  The  subject completed  the  first  dose  of  study  drug.  On  Day  12  following  initial  drug  administration,  the  site reported that the subject experienced one non-serious allergic reaction event of moderate severity with symptoms of eye swelling, lip swelling, and swelling face, went to the emergency room, and received IV fluids, an antihistamine (diphenhydramine), a H2 receptor antagonist (famotidine), and methylprednisolone to manage the symptoms. The subject claimed not to be exposed to either of the known allergens outlined in the medical history. The associated AE was considered by the investigator to have no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. The subject and  parent decided to discontinue  the  study  (i.e.,  withdrew  consent)  on  Day  31  after  3  failed  attempts  to  collect  blood samples and after given the option to continue study participation without receiving study drug.

The third paediatric subject  was randomized to receive risankizumab 300 mg. The subject completed all dosing up to the Week 28 visit and withdrew consent to continue study participation on Day 192. The subject specified reason of withdrawn consent was \"not satisfied with the skin condition.\" There were no AEs reported for this subject.

## CHMP comments

There were no SAEs experienced by subjects in the risankizumab 150 mg or 300 mg treatment groups during  the  blinded  period,  and  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  occurred  at  greater  frequency  in  the placebo group (reported in 4 subjects (5.8%) in the risankizumab 150 mg treatment group, 2 subjects (2.9%) in the risankizumab 300 mg treatment group, and 7 subjects (20.6%) in the placebo group).

The most common AEs in the all risankizumab treated population were in line with the known safety profile/underlying diseased population and included AEs from infections and infestations SOC (28% of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

150mg treated patients and 35% of 300mg treated patients), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC with  41.5%  of  150mg  treated  patients  and  35%  of  300mg  treated  patients  -  the  majority  of which were (a worsening of) atopic dermatitis 32.9% nd 25% respectively. There were no events of note  for  the  important  potential  risks  of  MACE  and  Serious  hypersensitivity  reactions.  Serious infections occurred in 2 (1.2%) subjects with cellulitis being the only reported PT. No events of serious infection  led  to  study  drug  discontinuation.  In  the  All  Risankizumab  Treated  population,  2  (1.2%) subjects  experienced  an  opportunistic  infection  excluding  TB  and  herpes  zoster,  with  cellulitis  and Kaposi's  varicelliform  eruption  being  the  only  reported  PTs.  No  events  in  this  category  led  to  study drug discontinuation. In the All Risankizumab Treated population, 2 subjects (2.4%) experienced at least  1  treatment-emergent  malignancy,  including  1  event  of  neoplasm  and  1  event  of  Bowen's Disease. The data relating to paediatric patients does not provide any new safety concerns.

Overall, it is agreed that no new safety signals have been identified.

## 2.3.3. Discussion clinical aspects.

Study  M16-813  was  a  Phase  2,  multicenter,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind  study  to evaluate  risankizumab  in  adult  and  adolescent  subjects  with  moderate  to  severe  AD.  Of  the  172 subjects randomized, 71 subjects (49.3%) completed the study.

The primary endpoint, the proportion of subjects achieving EASI 75 at Week 16, was not met. Neither risankizumab 150 mg nor risankizumab 300 mg showed a statistically significantly greater percentage of subjects achieving an EASI 75 response at Week 16 compared with the placebo group. Secondary endpoints,  (the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  IGA-AD  of  \"0\"  or  \"1\"  (on  a  5-point  scale)  with  a reduction from Baseline of ≥ 2 points at Week 16 and the proportion of subjects achieving a reduction of ≥ 4 points in worst pruritus numerical rating scale from Baseline to Week 16) were also not met. The MAH has outlined that the indication of AD will not be further pursued.

In  this  study  no  new  safety  signals  have  been  identified.  The  benefit-risk  profile  of  risankizumab remains unchanged, and therefore no update to the Summary of Product Characteristics have been proposed as a result of these data.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

Study M16-813 was a Phase 2, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study evaluating  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Risankizumab  150  mg  and  300  mg  in  adult  and  adolescent subjects  with  moderate  to  severe  Atopic  Dermatitis  (AD).  This  study  failed  to  meet  primary  and secondary endpoints and based on the efficacy results, this Phase 2 AD study was discontinued. There were no new safety concerns identified that would impact ongoing trials for other indications.
