## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for isavuconazole, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on anaphylactic reaction from spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between isavuconazole and anaphylactic reaction is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing isavuconazole should be amended accordingly.

Update of section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC to add the adverse reaction anaphylactic reaction with a frequency not known and a warning on anaphylactic reaction. The Package leaflet is updated accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for isavuconazole the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing isavuconazole is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information
