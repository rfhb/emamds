## Annex IV

Scientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for relugolix / estradiol / norethisterone acetate, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on urticaria and angioedema from clinical trials and spontaneous reports including cases with close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between the combination relugolix/estradiol/norethisterone acetate and urticaria and angioedema is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of medicinal products containing the combination relugolix/estradiol/norethisterone acetate should be amended accordingly.The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for relugolix / estradiol / norethisterone acetate the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing relugolix / estradiol / norethisterone acetate is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
