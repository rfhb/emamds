## 1. Introduction

On 20 April 2016, the MAH submitted one completed paediatric studies for Exjade®, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that this study is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Exjade is brand name for deferasirox presented as dispersible tablets in 3 doses strengths: 125, 250 and 500mg. The investigational drug was available as tablets at dosage strengths of 125 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg, packaged in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with an induction seal and child resistant closure.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The orally active, tridentate iron chelator deferasirox (company research code: ICL670) is the active ingredient in Exjade ®  dispersible tablets. Exjade is currently approved in over 100 countries. In the European Union, it was approved on 28-Aug-2006 for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older.

EXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups:

- in paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years,
-  in  adult  and  paediatric  patients  with  beta  thalassaemia  major  with  iron  overload  due  to infrequent blood transfusions (&lt;7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 years and older,
- in adult and paediatric patients with other anaemias aged 2 years and older.

Since 20 December 2012, Exjade has been also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload requiring chelation therapy when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients 10 years and older with nontransfusion- dependent thalassaemia syndromes.

The MAH submitted the final report for this clinical study and a clinical overview of this study.

The MAH submitted one final report for:

- CICL670ATR04: a phase II, multi-center, single-arm, prospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of deferasirox in beta thalassemia major patients after hematopoietic stem  cell transplantation (HSCT).

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## CICL670ATR04: A phase II, multi-center, single-arm, prospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of deferasirox in beta-thalassemia major patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

## Description

This is a phase II, multi-center, single-arm, prospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of deferasirox in beta thalassemia major patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The study was conducted in 9 study centers in Turkey.

## Methods

## Objective(s)

## Primary objectives:

The primary objective of the present study was to determine the safety; incidence, type and severity of adverse events including renal, hepatic, biochemistry and hematologic parameters of deferasirox in the treatment of iron overload after HSCT in patients with betathalassemia major in 12 months period.

## Secondary objectives:

The secondary objectives were:

- To evaluate the change in serum ferritin level from baseline to 12th month
- To evaluate the change in the further parameters of iron overload (cardiac iron and liver iron concentration by MR examination) from baseline to 12th month
- To determine the percentage of patients reaching serum ferritin levels lower than 500 μg/L at week 28 and week 52

## Study design

This  study  is  a  prospective,  single-arm,  multi-center,  local,  phase  II  clinical  study.  The  patients received oral deferasirox at an initial dose of 10 mg/kg/day and dose escalation was allowed up to 20 mg/kg daily for 12 months or until the serum ferritin level was below 500 μg/L. Dose titration was allowed in 3 months periods by 5 mg/kg/day at the discretion of the investigator unless any AE's were observed, which may create additional risk to the  patient. During the 12 months treatment period, patients were evaluated every 28 days. After the completion of the study, patients were treated at the physician's discretion with the current best treatment options. The study started on 19-Sep-2013 and completed  on  21-Oct-2015  (last  patient  last  visit).  The  study  was  conducted  in  9  study  centers  in Turkey.

After dose titration, serum creatinin, BUN, ALT, AST, proteinuria, adverse events was assessed in at least after 5 days and in 2 weeks.

Deferasirox (ICL670) was provided as 125 mg, 250 mg, and 500 mg dispersible tablets packaged in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with induction seals and child resistant closures labeled.

Medication labels complied with the legal requirements of the country where the study was implemented and was printed in the local language. The storage conditions and the expiration date for study drug was described on the medication label.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Novdrug capsules were supplied to the investigators at dose strengths of Exjade 125 mg, Exjade 250 mg and Exjade 500 mg.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Statistical Methods

Data were analyzed using the PASW 18.0 for Windows program. Descriptive statistics were expressed as numbers and percentages for categorical variables and as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, lower quartile, upper quartile and median for numerical variables. The variables were investigated using visual (histogram, probability plots) and analytical methods (KolmogorovSimirnov/Shapiro-Wilk's test) to determine whether or not they are normally distributed. Friedman test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test were conducted to test whether there is a significant change in the serum ferritin level. The Wilcoxon test was performed to test the significance of pairwise differences using Bonferonni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons.

The Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were calculated for grouped adverse events (defined by MedDRA System Organ Class terms). A p value &lt;0.10 was considered statistically significant.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

Beta-thalassemia patients between the age of 3 and 17 who had iron overload after HSCT were included in the study. The estimated sample size was 30 patients.

Overall 27 pediatric patients with beta thalassemia after HSCT were screened and 26 patients completed the study. One patient was lost to follow-up.

The mean age (SD) was 9.07 (3.81) years with a range from 3 to 16 years. A higher percentage of patients were male (70.4%). All patients were Caucasians. The mean (SD) body mass index (BMI) of the patients was 17.03 (2.37) kg/m2 ( Table 2-1 ) .

Efficacy  was  also  measured  with  cardiac  iron  and  liver  iron  concentration  by  MRI  examination.  An increase in median T2*MRI range was observed, though not significant, which was probably due to small  sample  size  ( p =0.50).  A  significant  decrease  was  measured  in  liver  iron  overload  ( p &lt;0.001): median R2*MRI change from 8.60 (2.80-43.00) at baseline to 4.10 (0.90-12.50) at week 52.

Taken together, these results indicate that deferasirox is effective in decreasing iron overload in betathalassemia major patients after HSCT.

## Assessor's comment

This study was not designed to assess deferasirox efficacy. Efficacy parameters were assessed as second objectives.

The changes in serum ferritin levels were first assessed from baseline to 12 th  month. Comparison of liver iron concentration by MRI examination before and after transplantation should be more relevant to assess efficacy as the serum ferritin levels could be higher (effect due ton inflammation) in the first year after transplantation. Serum ferritin levels decreased with deferasirox but this effect became significant from baseline since Week 20. This effect is sustained until Week 48 but the result should be taken with cautions because of the limited number of patients and the high difference between the lower and upper bounds of the serum ferritin median range in each patients visit. Finally, a percentage of 33.3% of patients reaching serum ferritin levels lower than 500 %g/l at the final evaluation visit (Week 52).

This study failed to demonstrate an improvement of cardiac iron overload (Cardiac MRI: 25.95 vs. 28.00; p=0.520). However, a decrease of liver iron overload could be observed from baseline to Week 52 (Liver MRI: 8.6 vs. 4.1; p&lt;0.001).

In conclusion, data collected in this study allow to document efficacy data of deferasirox in a specific pediatric population but should be taken with cautions as only 27 patients were included in this study among 9 study centers in Turkey.

## Safety results

Overall, 7.5% (10 out of 134) of the AEs were suspected to be drug-related [Table 12-10 of CICL670ATR04 CSR].

No action was taken in 37.3% of the AEs (50 out of 134). For 4.5% of the AEs, the study drug was adjusted or temporarily interrupted and medication was administered following 58.2% of the AEs [Table 12-11 of CICL670ATR04 CSR].

During the study, 8 AEs were grade 3 (increase in ALT in 3 patients, increase in AST in 2 patients, decrease in platelet count in 1 patient, herpes zoster in 1 patient and pneumonia in 1 patient) in 7.9% of patients [Table 12-12 of CICL670ATR04 CSR].

Time to onset of AEs was analyzed by PT and are presented in Table 12-13 of CICL670ATR04 CSR. Increase in liver enzymes (ALT and AST) occurred at a median of 28 and 30 days, respectively, and anaemia occurred at a median of 28 days. The median duration of ALT and AST increase was 28 days [Table 12-14 of CICL670ATR04 CSR].

## Assessor's comment

The MAH did not provide a table with AEs related to study drug.

## Deaths, other serious adverse events and other significant adverse events

There were no deaths during the study.

During  the  study,  3  patients  experienced  6  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs).  None  of  them  was considered to be drug-related. The respective narratives are provided below:

- Prior to start of deferasirox treatment, a  pediatric patient had elevated liver function tests and concomitant medication including ursodeoxycholic acid. On 14-Jan-2014, the subject experienced flu like symptoms, fever and bronchial infection which resulted in hospitalization on the same day. It was reported that the subject's flu like symptoms, fever and bronchial infection were possibly due to influenza virus type B, and treatment with Enfluvir and Sulperazon was started. On 15-Jan-2014, the subject's laboratory test included influenza virus type B-PCR which was found to be positive (normal value-normal). On 17-Jan-2014, the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subject received the first dose of deferasirox at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day. On 20-Jan-2014, he completely recovered from the event and was discharged from the hospital. On 25-Feb-2014, the subject was hospitalized for his routine annual control, laboratory tests were normal and was discharged from the hospital on26-Feb-2014. The investigator assessed the event (fever, flu-like symptoms, bronchial infection (influenza virus type B)) as serious (hospitalization). The investigator did not suspect a relation between the event (fever, flu like symptoms, bronchial infection (influenza virus type B) and the study medication as the study treatment was not started prior to the onset of the event. The investigator also stated that the subject was hospitalized for his annual control after \"HSCI\" and this hospitalization was not relevant to the study treatment. Although the patient experienced ALT and AST increased at two measurement points, they were Grade 1 and 2 events, and required no action.

- A pediatric subject with a medical history of gallbladder sludge. He had bronchitis (grade 2) and was taking Augmentine, when treatment was started with deferasirox at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day on 20-Jan-2014. The subject underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation due to beta thalassemia. On 03-Mar-2014, his ALT (846 IU/L; grade 4) and AST levels (1008 IU/L; grade 4). On 05-Mar-2014, the subject was diagnosed with viral hepatitis B, the patient received Zeffix, and treatment with study medication was temporarily interrupted for one month due to event. Investigator reported that the event improved after study medication was interrupted. On 10-Mar-2014, AST was 1098 IU/L grade 4, ALT was 743 IU/L grade 3, serology test including HBsAG was performed which was positive at a value of 25.63 (grade 2) and anti HBs value was less than 5 (grade 2). On 25-Mar-2014, AST was 60 IU/L and ALT was 59 IU/L. On 16 Apr 2014, AST was 50 IU/L (normal value: 10 to 40) CTCAE grade 1 and ALT was 19 IU/L (normal value: 8 to 40) CTCAE grade 1. The event was assessed as serious (medically significant) by the investigator. The investigator confirmed that the event was not due to progression of the underlying disease. The other possible contributory factor for ALT and AST increase included hepatitis B infection. The investigator did not suspect a causal relationship between the event and the study medication. The investigator gave a rationale that the etiologic cause of liver dysfunction, hepatitis B, tested positive in the subject. Hence the drug was considered as not related to liver dysfunction.
- Prior to start of deferasirox treatment, a pediatric patient presented on 9-Dec-2013 with neutrophil count decreased (0.49 x 109/L, neutropenia grade 4) with no hospitalization. On 10Dec-2013, the subject started treatment with 125 mg deferasirox twice daily. On 18-Dec-2013, the subject was reported to have infection and received treatment with Augmentin. No action was taken with regard to the study medication due to this event. On 23-Dec-2013, neutropenia was resolved. On 26-Dec-2013, the subject completely recovered from neutropenia grade 4 and infection and the hemoglobin value was 1.876/mm3. The investigator assessed the events as serious (medically significant) and did not suspect any relationship between the event and study medication. In summary, the patient had neutropenia before the start of the study drug, and he had neutropenia and anemia Grade 1 and 2 at some measurement points throughout the study.

Four patients experienced 6 AEs that led to study drug adjustment or temporary discontinuation:

- One patient experienced diarrhoea and vomiting
- One patient had ALT and AST increased
- One patient had ALT increased

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- One patient experienced hepatic enzymes increased, which was considered to be drug related by the investigator.

All AEs required dose adjustment or temporary discontinuation recovered to Grade 1 or less.

## Clinical laboratory evaluation

Creatinine increased levels (33% increase from baseline (BL) and above upper limit of normal (ULN) at two consecutive visits at least 5 days apart) was observed in 1 patient (3.7%)

Increase in proteinuria was observed in 9 patients (33.3%) [Table 14-11 and 14-14 of CICL670ATR04 CSR].

ALT  increased  levels  (BL  ALT&lt;ULN,  3X  BL/5X  ULN)  were  recorded  in  9  patients  (33.3%)  and  AST increased  levels  (BL  AST  ≥ULN,  3X  BL/5X  ULN)  in  3  patients  (11.1%)  [Table  14-  14  and  14-15  of CICL670ATR04 CSR].

Decrease  in  absolute  neutrophil  count  (&lt;1.5  x  109/L)  was  observed  in  6  patients  (22.2%):  two patients  had  severe  neutropenia  (0.53  x  109/L  and  0.49  x  109/L);  one  of  them  reported  as  SAE: Decrease in platelet count (&lt;100 x 109/L) was observed in 2 patients (7.4%) [Table 14- 12 and 14-13 of CICL670ATR04 CSR].

## Assessor's comment

The  safety  population,  with  subjects  from  the  FAS  having  had  at  least  one  safety  assessment  post baseline, consisted of 25 patients.

Research in the line listing of AEs by patient find 10 adverse events related to study medication in 4 patients (14.8%): 6 ALT increased (three grade 3 with two of them resulted on study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily  interrupted,  one  grade  2  resulted  on  study  drug  dosage  adjusted/temporarily interrupted and two grade 1), 2 AST increased of grade 3 with one of them of them resulted on study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted, one hepatic enzyme increased of grade 2 resulted on study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted and one urinary tract infection of grade 1.

In this study, elevation of transaminase was the most reported AEs related to study drug medication and was seen in 4 (14.8%) patients. This frequency is higher than reported in the SmPC for the overall population, for which elevations of transaminases were reported in 2% of patients.

Overall, there were no deaths during the study and no unexpected safety findings.

Discrepancies  regarding  the  number  of  drug  adjustment  or  temporary  discontinuation  are  noted between table 12-18 and 12-19 of the clinical overview and the line listing of AEs by patient. Research in  the  line  listing  find  4  patients  with  8  AEs  that  led  to  study  drug  adjustment  or  temporary discontinuation whereas in the table 12-18 and 12-19 the reported number is 4 patients with 6 AEs.

The most frequently reported AEs which led to study drug adjustment or temporary discontinuation was elevation of transaminase (6AEs of 8AEs).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## MAH's conclusion

Overall, there were no unexpected safety findings in the 27 pediatric patients with beta thalassemia after HSCT following treatment with deferasirox dispersible tablets up to a dose of 20 mg/kg daily for 12 months. Incidence, type and severity of AEs including renal, hepatic, biochemistry and hematologic parameters are consistent with the known safety profile of deferasirox.

Median serum ferritin levels and liver iron overload (measured with R2*MRI) significantly decreased during the course of the study indicating that deferasirox at doses between 10 to 20 mg/kg/day is effective in decreasing iron overload in beta thalassemia major pediatric patients after HSCT.

In conclusion, the benefit-risk assessment for deferasirox remains positive for the currently approved indications and justifies continuation of the development program in pediatric patients.

No changes to the pediatric information of the current deferasirox Core Data Sheet are proposed as a result  of  this  study  and  no  regulatory  consequences  of  the  submitted  study  are  anticipated  for  the pediatric information in the EU SmPC.

## Assessor's comment

## Efficacy

Concerning efficacy data, the ferritin levels were assessed as second objectives and should be used as supportive data.

## Safety

Type  and  severity  of  AEs  including  renal,  hepatic,  biochemistry  and  hematologic  parameters  are consistent with the known safety profile of deferasirox.

In this study, incidence of elevation of transaminases (4 patients, 14.8%) were higher than reported in the SmPC for the overall population, for which elevation of transaminases were reported in 2% of patients.

However, these data should be taken with cautions as only 27 patients were included in this study among 9 study centers in Turkey.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Patients with homozygous beta thalassemia require chronic blood transfusions to survive; however, ineffective erythropoiesis and transfusions cause iron overload that is ultimately fatal if not continuously treated. The only available alternative therapy is hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

Persistence of tissue iron overload can cause significant morbidity and mortality, such as that seen in hereditary hemochromatosis. Progression of liver disease to cirrhosis has been documented in some patients in the years after transplantation. Thus, iron removal by phlebotomy (the first treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

because of the potential toxicity of oral chelators especially when combined with cyclosporine) or chelation is indicated in all transplanted thalassemic patients who have evidence of hepatic iron overload.

The objective of this procedure is to comply with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 that requires any marketing authorization holder-sponsored studies which involve the use in the pediatric population of a medicinal product covered by a marketing authorization, whether or not they are conducted in compliance with an agreed pediatric investigation plan, to be submitted to the competent authority.

Study CICL670ATR04 is a MAH-sponsored study that has been recently completed and qualifies for Article 46 submission. This was a phase II, multi-center, single-arm, prospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of deferasirox in beta thalassemia major patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

Concerning efficacy data, the ferritin levels were assessed as second objectives and should be used as supportive data.

The changes in serum ferritin levels were first assessed from baseline to 12 th  month. Comparison of liver iron concentration by MRI examination before and after transplantation should be more relevant to assess efficacy as the serum ferritin levels could be higher (effect due to inflammation) in the first year after transplantation. Serum ferritin levels decreased with deferasirox but this effect became significant from baseline since Week 20. This effect is sustained until Week 48 but the result should be taken with cautions because of the limited number of patients (n=25) and the high difference between the lower and upper bounds of the serum ferritin median range in each patients visit. Finally, a percentage of 33.3% of patients reaching serum ferritin levels lower than 500 µg/l at the final evaluation visit (Week 52).

This study failed to demonstrate an improvement of cardiac iron overload (Cardiac MRI: 25.95 vs. 28.00; p=0.520). However, a decrease of liver iron overload could be observed from baseline to Week 52 (Liver MRI: 8.6 vs. 4.1; p&lt;0.001).

Finally, the primary objective of the present study was to determine the safety; incidence, type and severity of adverse events including renal, hepatic, biochemistry and hematologic parameters of deferasirox in the treatment of iron overload after HSCT in patients with beta-thalassemia major in 12 months period.

A total of 25 patients comprised the Safety set. Ten AEs related to study medication were found in 4 patients (14.8%). The drug related AEs reported in the pediatric population were ALT increased, AST increased, hepatic enzyme increased and urinary tract infection.

In this study, elevation of transaminases were the most reported AEs related to study drug medication and were seen in 4 (14.8%) patients. This frequency is higher than reported in the SmPC for the overall population, for which elevations of transaminases were reported in 2% of patients.

In conclusion, data collected in this study allow to document safety data of deferasirox in betathalassemia major patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) but should be taken with cautions as only 27 patients were included in this study among 9 study centers in Turkey.

Based on the data provided, we can conclude that no unexpected safety findings were identified. A higher frequency of elevation of transaminases related to study drug medication was seen in this study than reported in the SmPC for the overall population whereas in this study a decrease of liver iron overload  could  be  observed  from  baseline  to  Week  52.  However,  this  occurred  in  a  very  limited population of patients with expected severity of AE. No further regulatory action are required from this procedure.
