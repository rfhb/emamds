At a single dose of 250 mg, exposure to the parent compound was increased 317.0% and 529.5% for AUCt and Cmax, respectively, and to the active metabolite (AUCt, AUCinf, and Cmax) 497%, 500%, and 217%, respectively, for subjects with severe hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. In addition, the half-life of the active metabolite was increased, i.e. the mean half life was 16.0 hours in subjects with severe hepatic impairment compared to 5.47 hours in healthy subjects. Based on these findings, the use of telotristat etiprate is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score C). |

Concomitant use of Xermelo may change the exposure of medicinal products that are Carboxylesterase 2 substrates (e.g. prasugrel, irinotecan, capecitabine and flutamide). If co-administration is unavoidable, treatment should be monitored for suboptimal efficacy and safety events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| II/0015   | To update section 5.1 of the SmPC based on final results from study LX1606.1-302.CS (TELEPATH) listed as a category 3 study in the RMP; this is a multicentre, phase III, long-term extension study to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of telotristat etiprate in patients with carcinoid syndrome (CS). The updated RMP version 4.0 has also been submitted, also updating to GVP Module V (Rev 2).

Patients having participated in any Xermelo phase 2 or phase 3 carcinoid syndrome study were eligible to enter the study at the same dose level and regimen as identified in their original study, for at least 84 weeks of treatment. No new significant safety signals were identified. The secondary objective of this study was to evaluate changes in patients ' quality of life (QOL) through Week 84. QOL was generally stable over the course of the study. |

As a precautionary measure, it is recommended that patients with severe renal impairment will be monitored for signs of reduced tolerability. The use of Xermelo is not recommended in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis (eGFR < 15 mL/min requiring dialysis) because efficacy and safety of Xermelo in these patients has not been established.                                                                                                                                  |

| II/0005 | Update of section 5.2 of the SmPC in order to add information from an in vivo drug interaction study (study identifier: LX1606.1-110-NRM) to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of concomitant gastric acid reducers such as PPIs on the PK of telotristat ethyl, LP-778902. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data    | 21/03/2019 | 27/05/2019 | SmPC | Concomitant use of telotristat etiprate (Xermelo, the hippurate salt of telotristat ethyl) with acid-reducers (omeprazole and famotidine) showed that the AUC of telotristat ethyl was increased 2-3 fold, while the AUC of the active metabolite (telotristat) was not changed. Since telotristat ethyl is rapidly converted to its active metabolite, which is > 25× more active than telotristat ethyl, no dose adjustments are required when using Xermelo with acid reducers. |
| II/0010 | Update of section 5.3 of the SmPC in order to add information on carcinogenicity based on final results from study 8273113 (104-Week Oral Gavage Carcinogenicity and Toxicokinetic Study with LX1606 in Rats). The MAH took also the occasion to introduce some editorial changes in section 5.3 of the SmPC in alignment with the QRD wording. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to | 14/03/2019 | 27/05/2019 | SmPC | The carcinogenic potential of telotristat etiprate was studied in transgenic mice (26 weeks) and rats (104 weeks).

| II/0002/G           | This was an application for a group of variations. Submission of the final report from studies LX301 (pivotal phase III study) and LX303 (supportive phase III study) two randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies listed as category 3 studies in the RMP. The objective of study LX301 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of telotristat etriprate in patients with carcinoid syndrome not adequately controlled by Somatostatin Analog (SSA) therapy; while the objective of study LX303 is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of telotristat etiprate in patients with carcinoid syndrome. In addition, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) took the opportunity to provide updated safety data from the long-term extension study LX302; a phase 3, multicentre, open-label study to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of telotristat. The RMP (version 3.0) was updated to reflect those safety data. The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). | 08/02/2018 | n/a        |    | With regards to the efficacy, the updated results from the open-label extensions of studies LX301 and LX303 are in line with the findings in the interim analyses provided during the marketing authorisation application and no changes to the previous efficacy assessments are required. With regards to the safety, the final analysis of the open- label uncontrolled extensions of studies LX301 and LX303 as well as the updated data from the ongoing uncontrolled study LX302 do not reveal new or unexpected safety findings. Overall, these results do not warrant any change to the Product Information of Xermelo. |
