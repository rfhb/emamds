## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Introduction

Pramipexole  is  a  non-ergot  dopamine  agonist  with  high  in  vitro  specificity  at  the  D2  subfamily  of dopamine  receptors.  Pramipexole  is  a  full  agonist  and  exhibits  higher  affinity  for  the  D3  receptor subtype than for D2 or D4 receptor subtypes. It is structurally different from the ergot-derived drugs.

Pramipexole  tablets  were  approved  in  the  US  in  1997  for  the  treatment  of  signs  and  symptoms  of Parkinson's  disease,  followed  by  marketing  authorisations  in  the  European  Union  (EU),  Norway, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Japan, Eastern European countries, countries in the Near and Far East, and South America.

In addition to the approved indication in advanced and early stage Parkinson's disease the MAH has submitted an application for the extension of the indication to

'Mirapexin  tablets  are  indicated  for  symptomatic  treatment  of  idiopathic  Restless  Legs  Syndrome (RLS)\".

Consequential changes were introduced in section 4.2 (dose adjustment), 4.4 (augmentation phenomenon),  4.8  (hallucination)  and  5.1  (addition  of  subheadings  'Clinical  trials  in  Parkinson's disease' and 'Clinical trials in Restless Legs Syndrome').

RLS  is  a  neurological  sensory-motor  disorder  characterised  by  four  essential  diagnostic  criteria defined by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) in 1995 and updated in 2003, with an estimated prevalence in the general population of 2.5% to 15%. The majority of patients who consult a primary care physician receive inappropriate treatment. The current treatment options for RLS are levodopa/benserazide. Although treatment with levodopa is effective in the short term, the long-term  use  of  levodopa  is  complicated  by  the  frequent  occurrence  of  augmentation.  Dopamine agonists,  including pramipexole, were regarded as first line treatment in 'Principles and Practice of Sleep Medicine' (3 rd Ed., Saunders, 2000).

Prior  to  initiation  of  pivotal  clinical  trials,  the  MAH  sought  scientific  advice  from  CHMP  on  the clinical trial programme (EMEA/CHM P/5122/02, 17 October 2002).

The CHMP asked for a 3-month double-blind placebo controlled study to assess short-term efficacy. However for the assessment of maintenance efficacy randomised double-blind trials of 6-12 months duration were deemed necessary. In these trials also rebound and augmentation were to be evaluated. The RLS rating scale was considered an adequate endpoint for the pivotal trials. The primary analysis based on mean difference from baseline may be strengthened by a secondary responder analysis. The MAH did not consider it feasible to run a 6-month parallel group, placebo controlled study as the drop out rate in the placebo group was expected to be very high, which could have led to an imbalanced treatment group size at the end of the study jeopardizing the acceptance of the statistical analysis. In such a situation the ICH guideline topic E 10 recommends a long-term, placebo-controlled withdrawal design. The MAH expected that a long-term trial (6-12 months duration) would be jeopardized by a high drop out rate in the placebo group and therefore chose a withdrawal design. However, the ICH guideline  E10  does  not  specify  that  an  expected  high  dropout  rate  necessarily  should  lead  to  the preference  of  the  withdrawal  design.  It  is  the  opinion  of  the  CHMP  that  a  positive  6-12  months placebo controlled trial would lead to significant more information with regard to efficacy and safety.

The CHMP proposed a long-term active comparator trial with levodopa as the best choice. An active comparator study with L-dopa/benserazide was not performed as this combination was registered for idiopathic RLS only in Germany and Switzerland. Thus it could not be regarded as an accepted 'gold standard'  throughout  Europe.  Although  levodopa/benserazide  was  not  approved  in  all  involved countries, a comparative trial would have provided very valuable insight into the efficacy and safety of pramipexole (e.g. augmentation). This is further exemplified by the fact that 42% of patients in study 248.546 had previously taken dopa and dopa derivatives.

The  CHMP  accepted  the  concept  of  the  inclusion  of  a  mixed  population  in  the  development programme, including pre-treated and de novo patients. The MAH included a mixed population in the development  programme,  including  pre-treated  and de  novo patients.  The  inclusion  of  a  mixed population was endorsed by both parties. This gives an opportunity for post-hoc/secondary analysis of efficacy in relation to baseline disease state (IRLSRS/CGI).

## 2. Quality aspects

For  the  new  indication  doses  of  up  to  0.75  mg  salt  will  be  recommended.  Considering  that  tablets containing 0.75 mg salt are not readily available, this dose can be administered in the form of 3 tablets containing 0.25 mg salt corresponding to 0.54 mg base or 1 tablet each containing 0.5 mg and 0.25 mg salt corresponding to 0.53 mg base. The CHMP considered it acceptable to express the dose as 0.54 mg base in the product information.

## 3. Non clinical aspects

The definitive pathophysiology of RLS has not been determined, but neuropharmacological evidence might suggest a mild striatal presynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction. A disinhibition of normal CNS pacemakers  has  also  been  suggested.  There  is  not  any  special  animal  model  for  this  disorder.  To support treatment of Parkinson's disease, pramipexole underwent a comprehensive pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological evaluation, which data has been provided in the initial marketing authorisation  application  (MAA).  The  MAH's  conclusion  of  the  nonclinical  safety  assessment provided  for  pramipexole  in  Parkinson's  disease  is  therefore  endorsed.  No  safety  concerns  are predicted from the preclinical point of view associated with the use of pramipexole to RLS patients, in whom the exposure will be substantially lower than that for patients with Parkinson's disease.

## 4. Clinical aspects

## Clinical trials conducted outside the community

According to Art. 8.3(ib) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, and Art. 6 of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the MAH was asked to provide a statement on that the clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. The MAH responded that study 248.543 was performed in the US and in the study report it is stated: \"The trial  was carried out in compliance with the protocol, the principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki (1996 Version), in accordance with the ICH tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP)  and  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  regulatory  requirements,  which  was  considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Pramipexole tablets containing 0.125mg, 0.25mg, and 0.5mg pramipexole dihydrochloride monohydrate  (corresponding  to  0.088  mg  and  0.35  mg  pramipexole  base)  were  used  in  the  RLS clinical trial programme. These 3 dose strengths are already approved / marketed in the EU. For study 248.543 carried out in the US, the same formulation was used.

## 4.1 Clinical pharmacology

To support the RLS indication, the steady state pharmacokinetics of pramipexole tablets administered once  daily  to  RLS  patients  was  investigated  as  a  sub-study  of  study  248.546.  No  other  clinical pharmacology studies profiling the pharmacokinetics of pramipexole were conducted as part of the RLS development programme.

The study was performed during the 6-month open-label, uncontrolled phase of the study 248.546, during which all patients were titrated to an individually optimised dose within the first four weeks (starting dose = 0.125 mg; maximum dose = 0.75 mg).

The CHMP considered that the pharmacokinetic parameters in 25 patients suffering from idiopathic RLS provided evidence that the pharmacokinetics of pramipexole is  generally  comparable  between this  study  and  previous  studies  with  pramipexole  in  healthy  volunteers  and  patients  suffering  from Parkinson's  disease.  However,  the  pharmacokinetic  information  gained  from  the  present  study  is limited, but since the dose used in RLS is lower than in Parkinson's disease patients and no other PK factors  are  believed  to  differ  significantly  between  healthy  subjects  and  RLS  patients,  the  present study is considered sufficient with regard to PK in patients with RLS. Effects of gender, age and renal function on the pharmacokinetics of pramipexole are essentially the same as previously reported and therefore no new statement is proposed for the SPC.

## 4.2 Clinical efficacy

## 4.2.1 Introduction

To  confirm  efficacy  and  safety  in  this  therapeutic  indication  the  MAH  set  up  a  clinical  trial programme consisting  of  four  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trials.  This  programme included approximately 1000 patients treated for up to 12 weeks. Open continuation trials lasted for up to 1 year. The clinical study programme consisted of the following studies:

1. Pivotal trial: Study 248.543. Multicentre fixed-dose trial conducted in the US
2. Pivotal trial: Study 248.546. Multicentre European (German) sustained efficacy trial
3. Supportive trial: Study 248.515. Single-centre polysomnography study
4. Supportive trial: Study 248.520. Multicentre European flexible-dose trial

## 4.2.2 Clinical trials

## Study 248.543

## Methods

With  this  study,  short-term  (12  weeks)  efficacy  and  safety  of  pramipexole  was  evaluated  in  a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose design. Patients were randomised to placebo or 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, or 0.75 mg of pramipexole. The focus was on clinical parameters of RLS. The primary endpoint was the change in the Restless Legs Syndrome Rating Scale (RLSRS) score from baseline  and  Clinical  Global  Impression  -  Improvement  (CGI-I)  after  12  weeks  of  treatment.  The fixed-dose design permitted a direct comparison of the different pramipexole doses with placebo. In addition, augmentation was evaluated using the Augmentation Severity Rating Scale (ASRS). In total, 344 patients were treated and constituted the safety population. The study was conducted in 45 centres (43 centres treated patients) in the US.

The primary endpoint was the change in RLSRS total score from baseline to Week 12 (ANCOVA) and the proportion of CGI-I responders at Week 12 (CMH). For the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method, the latest value available was used for endpoint calculation. Secondary endpoints were  the  Clinical  Global  Impression  (CGI)  subscales  (severity  of  illness,  therapeutic  effect,  side effects),  RLSRS-responders,  level  of  daytime  sleepiness  (ESS),  change  in  visual  analogue  scales (VAS)  of  RLS  severity,  Patient  Global  Impression  (PGI),  Augmentation  Severity  Rating  Scale (ASRS), and RLS-related quality of life (Johns Hopkins RLS-QoL).

In the placebo group 75 patients (87.2%), and in the overall pramipexole group 206 patients (79.8%) completed  the  study.  Among  the  pramipexole  dose  groups  88.6%  (0.25  mg),  76.3%  (0.5  mg),  and 74.4% (0.75 mg) completed the study. In the placebo group 12.8% of patients discontinued the study prematurely compared with 11.4% (0.25 mg), 23.8% (0.5 mg), and 25.6% (0.75 mg) for each of the pramipexole dose groups. The most frequent reason for premature discontinuation was the occurrence of  adverse  events  in  7.0%  (placebo),  5.7%  (0.25  mg),  13.8%  (0.5  mg),  and  17.8%  (0.75  mg)  of patients.  The  majority of patients  were  of  Caucasian  origin  (97.3%),  only 2.7%  of  patients  were  of African-American or Asian origin. Overall, 62.2% of patients were female and 37.8% were male, the mean age was 51.4 years, and the mean RLSRS total score at baseline was 23.5.



The CHMP considered that a post-hoc analysis in patients with International restless Legs Syndrome study  group  Scale  (IRLSRS)  &gt;24  (as  defined  recently  by  the  CHMP  as  moderate  to  severe  RLS) should be performed by the MAH. The MAH responded that the results reveal that pramipexole is significantly more effective than placebo in patients with a RLSRS score at baseline ≤ 24 as well as in patients with a RLSRS score at baseline &gt; 24. This effect is demonstrated across three trials (study grouping:  double-blind  periods  of  248.515,  248.520,  248.543  in  the  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS) population).  Following  assessment  of  the  MAH's  responses  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  effect (difference in RLSRS between placebo and pramipexole) was highest in patients with IRLSRS &gt;24 (as defined by the CHMP as moderate to severe RLS). The CHMP concluded that the MAH should adapt the CHMP definition of moderate to severe RLS (IRLSRS &gt; 24) and define this as the RLS population for which pramipexole is indicated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP considered that the MAH should discuss the impact of patient withdrawals in the study. The FAS (using LOCF) and the per-protocol set are not sufficient to estimate the extent of bias that has  potentially  been  introduced.  Following  the  MAH's  responses  the  CHMP  considered  that  the discontinuation was dose related (in contrast to the efficacy). Most of discontinued cases had 'Other adverse  event'  stated  as  the  reason  for  discontinuation.  No  clear  differences  could  be  observed between placebo and pramipexole, besides the number of discontinued patients, with regard to reason for discontinuation. The analysis of RLSRS in patients who discontinued do not raise concern, that the dropout rate influence the efficacy conclusions.

RLSRSResponseafter12weeks/FAS,LOCF

Stratified analysis of response in relation to RLSRS at baseline showed that the efficacy of treatment (with  regard  to  RLSRS  reduction)  increased  with  increasing  RLSRS  at  baseline.  The  highest  effect was found in patients with high baseline RLSRS (Severe/very severe RLS). A difference of only -2.4 in RLSRS found in patients with moderate RLS further emphasise this. The CHMP considered that there  was  a  significant  reduction  in  RLSRS  for  both  placebo  and  pramipexole  treated  patients. However, the difference in RLSRS response between placebo and pramipexole is of doubtful clinical relevance in light of the high placebo response.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  MAH  responded  that  in  published  literature  an  adjusted  treatment  difference  of  -2.5  and  -3.0 points  on  the  RLSRS  scale  is  described  as  clinically  relevant  in  two  studies  using  a  flexible  dose design.  In  light  of  the  achieved  treatment  difference  of  -4.3  points  in  a  fixed  dose  trial  this  can  be regarded  as  a  clinically  relevant  result.  Due  to  the  fixed  dose  design  in  study  248.543,  individual patients  may  not  have  received  optimal  treatment,  whereas  the  flexible  dose  design  allows  for individual dose optimisation and hence increased efficacy. This is confirmed in the 6-week doubleblind period of Study248.520 where a flexible dose design was used. Following the MAH's responses the CHMP considered that the efficacy of pramipexole is in line with products with similar modes of action.

The CHMP questioned the robustness of the study as the results are changed in the direction of the effect size (in favour of placebo for very severe RLS). The MAH responded that the adjusted mean effect size (SE) for placebo treated patients in RLSRS of -19.9 (7.0) is exceptional, but that this result is  based  on  a  small  subgroup  of  6  patients  only,  showing  a  large  standard  error  and  is  therefore considered not to be conclusive, as well as that the change from baseline in RLSRS score in severe and very severe RLS patients is similar (-14.8, -16.0, respectively). Following the MAH's responses the CHMP considered that the exceptionally high placebo response observed for very severe RLS (and thus the change of direction of the effect size) may be due to small sample size.

## Primary endpoint - Proportions of CGI-I responders

The proportions of CGI-I responders (p-value vs. placebo) were 51.2% (placebo), 74.7% (0.25 mg, p=0.0005),  67.9%  (0.5  mg,  p=0.0484),  72.9%  (0.75  mg,  p=0.0038).  At  the  final  visit,  the  RLSRSresponder rates were (p-value vs. placebo): 42.4% (placebo), 61.4% (0.25 mg, p=0.0075), 62.0% (0.5 mg, p=0.0124), and 62.1% (0.75 mg, p=0.0135).

Improvement at final visit (12 weeks) / FAS

The CHMP considered that improvement in CGI-I was correlated with RLSRS. The responder rate is characterized by a high responder rate in placebo treated patients.

## Primary endpoint - Time course in 'the change in RLSRS total score'

Assessment  of  the  time  course  of  the  primary  endpoint,  'the  change  in  RLSRS  total  score'  was analysed at Weeks 4, 6 and 12 using data of those patients, who provided an assessment after 4 weeks, which  was  extended,  if  necessary  by  LOCF.  After  4  weeks  the  treatment  difference  compared  to placebo of -6 points was highly significant (p&lt;0.0001). This was confirmed after 6 weeks (0.25mg: p&lt;0.0005;  0.5mg:  p&lt;0.0001;  0.75mg:  p&lt;0.0001).  Due  to  the  analysis  approach  of  using  the  last

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

retrievable value, after 12 weeks the minimal treatment effect was -3.6 points, but still all doses were significant. Similar observations were also seen in the PPS population analysis.

The CHMP considered that the efficacy of pramipexole seems to ware off with time (difference being -6 points after 4 weeks, dropping to -3.6 points, after 12 weeks). This warrants further assessments of efficacy  in  long-term  trials  i.e.  6  -  12  months  double  blind  trials  as  suggested  by  the  CHMP.  The explanation previously provided by the MAH for not conducting a study of this length (not feasible due to expected high dropout-rate in the placebo group) was not considered valid in light of current experience with pramipexole. The CHMP considered that the Study 248.546 did not provide evidence for  maintained  efficacy  over  9  months  of  treatment.  Under  all  circumstances  the  wearing  off  of treatment effect is not assessed in this study design (no placebo group for comparison within the first 6 months of treatment). Study 248.546 (Pivotal study) cannot be used to assess whether the effect of pramipexole  in  RLS  wears  off  with  trial  duration  (no  placebo  group  for  comparison  in  the  first  6 moths). In the 12-week pivotal Study 248.543 there  is  a  25%  reduction  in  efficacy  over  the  last  8 weeks  of  treatment.  Comparisons  across  studies 248.543,  248.515  and  248.520 indicate  decreased efficacy  with  trial  duration.  The  data  indicate  that  efficacy  of  pramipexole  compared  to  placebo  is wearing off with trial duration. Thus, the MAH was requested to provide stopping rules for continued treatment beyond 3 months since the effect compared to placebo wears off with treatment duration, which should be mentioned in the SPC.

## Secondary endpoint

## Secondary endpoint - Patient Global Impression (PGI) after 12 weeks

In the pramipexole total group, 61.4% of patients were PGI responders after 12 weeks compared with 44.7% in the placebo group. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test with stratification by pooled centre showed a significant difference in favour of pramipexole total (p=0.0056). The pramipexole 0.25 mg group  revealed  significance,  while  the  other  treatment  groups  were  not  significantly  different  than placebo.

The CHMP considered that in the pramipexole total group, 61.4% of patients were PGI responders after  12  weeks  compared  with  44.7%  in  the  placebo  group,  which  was  significant.  However,  when comparing  the  individual  dosages,  the  difference  was  not  significant.  The  effect  (i.e.  difference between treatment and placebo) did wear off with time. This parameter warrants further assessments of  efficacy  in  long-term  trials  i.e.  6  -  12  months  double  blind  trials  as  previously  suggested  by  the CHMP.

## Secondary endpoint - Visual Analogue Scales (VASs) for the assessment of RLS severity / FAS

The VASs used in this Study are a self-designed instrument that was not validated against any other assessment  scale.  Therefore,  inferences  from  this  scale  to  other  scales  for  the  assessment  of  RLS symptoms are very limited.

The CHMP considered that a significant effect on the VAS was identified and as such the results of the VAS are supportive. However as indicated by the MAH, the VAS scales have not been validated against any other assessment scale and therefore it is difficult to draw definite conclusions from these findings.

## Secondary endpoint - Analysis of Epworth Sleepiness Scale



At  baseline,  the  mean  score  (±SD)  was  8.1  (±4.4)  in  the  placebo  group  and  7.5  (±4.5)  for  the pramipexole total group. At week 12, both treatment groups showed a decrease in the mean ESS score to 6.6 (±3.9) in the placebo group and to 5.8 (±4.0) in the pramipexole total group. The mean reduction in the placebo group was 1.6 (±3.8) compared with 1.7 (±4.0) in the pramipexole total group, which was not significant.

Analysis of covariance with factors treatment and pooled centre, covariates age and baseline RLSRS

The CHMP considered that the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) did not reveal a difference between pramipexole and placebo.

## Secondary endpoint - Augmentation Severity Rating Scale

Augmentation  is  defined  as  the  worsening  of  RLS  symptoms  attributable  to  a  specific  therapeutic intervention for RLS and exhibits a shift of RLS symptoms, which occur 2 or more hours earlier than the observed time of onset of symptoms during the initial course of stable treatment, or the state before treatment initiation. For assessment of this phenomenon, the definition that augmentation should be present for at least 1 week, for a minimum of 5 days per week, to meet diagnostic criteria was applied in  this  study  using  the  Augmentation  Severity  Rating  Scale  (ASRS)  for  measurement  at  end  of treatment  (Week  12).  The  augmentation  score  interpreted  the  changes  from  baseline  (without providing a baseline score) and varies from 0 (no augmentation) to 4 (maximal augmentation). The highest ASRS scores calculated per treatment group were found between 2.0 and 2.25, with a median of  0.25  (placebo)  and  0.5  (pramipexole  groups  and  total).  As  can  be  seen  below  there  was  no significant measurable augmentation observed in any pramipexole dose group relative to placebo.

The CHMP considered that the MAH has provided the results of a new scale for the assessment of augmentation, and the results of the comparison of placebo versus individual dosages. Following the MAH's responses the CHMP considered that it is agreed that the rating scale is non-validated and the clinical significance therefore is difficult to interpret. Moreover, the study was not powered to show a difference in augmentation. Although not statistically significant, the results indicate that augmentation  may  be  more  often  found  in  patients  treated  with  pramipexole  (the  frequency  of ASRS&gt;0.5 is 29% higher for pramipexole treated compared to placebo). The CHMP considered that the issue resolved, but the clinical significance of augmentation need further consideration.

## Secondary endpoint - Johns Hopkins RLS Quality of Life Scale

The CHMP considered that there was a significant effect of pramipexole as measured by the Johns Hopkins  RLS  Quality  of  Life  Scale.  There  was  a  minor  increase  in  the  QoL  for  placebo  treated patients  from  week 6 to week 12, but otherwise the effect as measured on the Johns Hopkins RLS Quality of Life Scale is reassuring with regard to maintained effect of pramipexole in RLS. However, the LOCF method could lead to overestimation of the effect of pramipexole and therefore an analysis of the PPS would be supportive.

* Analysis of covariance with factors treatment and pooled ceutre, covariates age and baseline RLS-QoL

The  MAH provided  analysis  for  the  PPS  population  is  shown  in  the  below  table  and  supports  the results of the FAS analysis. The adjusted difference to placebo in the PPS analysis is even larger when compared to the pramipexole combined dose groups. These data confirm that the LOCF method used for  the  primary  analysis  did  not  lead  to  an  overestimation  of  the  pramipexole  effect.  The  CHMP agreed that the analysis for the PPS population supports the results of the FAS analysis.

## Study 248.546

## Methods

The main objective of this study was the evaluation of long-term efficacy of pramipexole treatment compared to placebo in a randomised withdrawal design. During a 6-month open-label run-in phase, all  patients received pramipexole (dose range 0.125 mg-0.75 mg). At month 6, responders based on RLSRS score and CGI-I were randomised to either continue on the same dose of pramipexole or to receive placebo under double-blind conditions. This study was performed at 13 centres in Germany and involved 224 patients of which 150 patients were randomised into the double-blind period.

The primary endpoint was time to a pre-defined target event (worsening of RLS as assessed by the CGI-I and the RLSRS score, RLSRS score &gt; 15 and CGI-I at least 'minimally worse') during the second  period  of  the  study.  In  addition,  in  this  study  augmentation  was  evaluated  using  the Augmentation  Severity  Rating  Scale.  The secondary  endpoints analysed  during  the  FAS  period  2 were CGI-severity of illness, CGI therapeutic effect, CGI-side effects, PGI, Johns Hopkins Quality of Life score, VASs, ESS, and ASRS.

In total, 224 patients were entered and treated with pramipexole in the open-label run-in phase (period 1).  Of  these,  41  patients  (18.3%)  discontinued  prematurely  in  the  open  label  phase.  Overall,  150 patients were randomised in period 2 and 33 patients did not enter period 2. The second period of a nominal duration of 3 months was completed by 96 patients (64.0%) overall. With regard to treatment group, the frequency of premature discontinuations was much higher in the placebo group (65.3%) than in the pramipexole group (9.0%), as expected because of the randomised withdrawal design of period 2.

The CHMP considered that drugs with psychotropic effects are usually tapered off over a substantial period (usually weeks to months) to avoid the introduction of rebound phenomena and a rationale for not using a taper off in this trial should be provided. The MAH responded that in the current SPC for pramipexole tapering off is recommended from high doses to avoid possible symptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome which have been reported with abrupt withdrawal of dopaminergic therapy. However, tapering off is not recommended to avoid rebound phenomena. Parkinson's disease patients take their total daily dose in 3 equally divided doses, which leads to a very constant plasma level of pramipexole with a low peak/trough ratio. In contrast in RLS patients the peak/trough ratio of the plasma level is much higher compared to Parkinson's patients according to the once daily dosing. In study 248.546 the PK profile of pramipexole in RLS patients was investigated. The daily variation of PPX blood levels for 0.54 base (0.75mg of salt) is twice as high as the variation from trough to wash-out, and therefore the MAH considers it not necessary to taper off pramipexole in the indication RLS.

Following the MAH's responses the CHMP considered that the biological effect of pramipexole in RLS  may  well  be  present  long  after  the  blood  concentration  has  reached  low  levels.  The  results presented do not provide evidence against the need to taper off pramipexole and do not exclude the possibility of rebound and need for taper off pramipexole in RLS. Rebound may be a problem after abrupt discontinuation, and should be reflected in the SPC. It was agreed to add the following sentence to  section  4.2.2  of  the  SPC:  ' Rebound  (worsening  of  symptoms  after  abrupt  discontinuation  of treatment) can not be excluded.'

The  CHMP  considered  that  it  seems  quite  evident  that  patients  with  a  response  to  pramipexole treatment  who  were  randomised  to  continued  pramipexole  or  placebo  did  better  on  continued pramipexole  with  regard  to  the  primary  outcome  parameters  (time  to  event/change  in  RLSRS  and CGI-I). However, the nature of the trial design makes it difficult to interpret. The difference observed may be due to lack of efficacy among placebo treated patients but may also reflect rebound following treatment for 6 months with a psychoactive drug (no taper). In addition, since the placebo response is extensive this is not evidence of sustained efficacy of pramipexole beyond 6 months of treatment. The trial  therefore  provides  questionable  evidence  for  long-term  efficacy  of  pramipexole  in  RLS.  The MAH responded that the trial design of a randomised withdrawal study is used to investigate whether responders to active treatment stay responders when the treatment is switched to placebo or whether the  treatment  effect  vanishes  after  randomisation  to  placebo.  In  general  it  cannot  be  assumed  that placebo treated patients will immediately deteriorate in such a setting. This trial design served also to counterbalance  possible  placebo  responses  as  only  treatment  responders  were  randomised  to  the double-blind period. The results of Study 248.546 demonstrate the long-term efficacy of pramipexole

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

up to 9 months. Placebo treated patients deteriorated considerably after discontinuation of pramipexole, whereas patients who stayed on pramipexole showed a continued benefit. To avoid any bias due to a 'rebound' phenomenon after abrupt discontinuation of pramipexole, the MAH excluded those  patients  from  the  analysis,  who  experienced  an  immediate  deterioration  after  one  day.  In  a further analysis excluding all patients who had reached the predefined target event within 1 week after randomisation a highly significant statistical difference in the primary endpoint (time to target event) was  still  shown  between  pramipexole  and  placebo.  This  supports  the  findings  from  the  primary analyses  that  early  deterioration  after  discontinuation  of  pramipexole  treatment  is  not  biasing  the treatment  effect  in  favour  of  pramipexole.  The  MAH  considers  the  results  of  this  study  are  strong evidence for long-term efficacy of pramipexole in RLS. Following the MAH's responses the CHMP considered that the biological effect of pramipexole may extend longer than 1 week, despite the low plasma  levels.  And  it  is  not  excluded  that  rebound  may  be  present  more  than  1  week  after discontinuation  of  pramipexole  (almost  all  the effect is seen  within  the first 3  weeks  after randomisation).

For  the  double-blind  phase  (period  2),  the  safety  period  2  population  comprised  all  patients  who received at least one dose of the study drug in period 2 (N=150). The FAS period 2 was formed by all patients  in  the  safety  period  2  population  who  provided  Visit-10  RLSRS  data  and  had  at  least  one post-randomisation assessment of RLSRS / CGI-I, and who took at least 2 doses of randomised study medication on 2 consecutive days (N=147). The per-protocol set (PPS) period 2 was defined as all patients from the FAS period 2 without important protocol deviations (N=109). Overall, 39 patients were not included in the PPS period 2 due to important protocol deviations (38 patients from FAS period 2 plus patient 1262). The PPS period 2 thus represented 72.7% of the safety period 2 population

There were a total of 39 protocol violations in the study (39/150 = 26%) after randomisation, most of which were found in the placebo group. The MAH responded that according to the clinical trial report of  Study  248.546,  the  number  of  patients  with  protocol  violations  (PV)  in  the  placebo  group  as  22 (30.6%) and in the pramipexole group 17 (21.8%) was higher in the placebo group compared to the pramipexole group.

The category 'Non-responder' covers all patients randomised without having fulfilled the responder criteria  at  the  end  of  the  6-month  open  label  period.  The  category  'No  full  compliance'  covers  all patients who did not take the trial drug continuously. The category 'Prohibited medication use' covers those patients who did not only take trial drug but also other RLS medications, which was not allowed due  to  the  study  protocol.  These  PVs  were  not  linked  to  adverse  events.  Furthermore,  the  results within the PPS population, where patients with important PVs were excluded, confirm the results of the primary efficacy analyses performed in the FAS population. Following the MAH's responses the CHMP considered that as stated by the MAH the protocol violations does not reflect adverse events (RSL symptoms/augmentation).

## Secondary endpoints

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  secondary  endpoints  were  in  favour  of  pramipexole  treatment, however shortcomings of the trial make the observations of limited value.

## Secondary analysis - Assessment of efficacy in FAS Period 1



At the end of period 1, overall substantial improvements were observed for the following endpoints: RLSRS total score (mean change from baseline 15.7), RLSRS responder rate (76.6% full or partial responders), CGI-I (78.9% 'much / very much improved'), CGI severity of illness (51.8% sufficiently improved), CGI-therapeutic effect (80.3% sufficiently improved), PGI (80.2% improved), RLS-VASs (median changes from baseline were 41.0 mm [RLS severity while getting to sleep], 52.0 mm [RLS severity in the course of the night], 10.0 mm [RLS severity in the course of the day], and 39.0 mm [satisfaction with sleep]), and Johns Hopkins Quality of Life (median change from baseline +17.5). Few patients  (6.0%)  reported  a  significant  interference  of  side  effects  with  their  function.  Daytime sleepiness assessed by the ESS did not increase but showed some improvement (mean change from baseline 1.6).  Substantial  improvements  were  evident  already  after  1  to  2  weeks  of  treatment demonstrating the rapid onset of pramipexole treatment effects.

Source data: Appendix 16.1.9.2, Table 6.4.1.3

The CHMP concluded that the overall response rate (&gt;50% reduction) in RLSRS was 63.1% in the 6 months open-label phase of the trial (Period 1), which compares to a response rate of 61.8% in Study 248.543.  However,  one  would  expect  a  higher  response  in  an  open  trial  with  flexible  titration (248.546)  compared  to  a  placebo-controlled  trial  with  fixed  dosages  (Study  248.543).  The  MAH responded  that  open  label  trials  cannot  be  compared  with  data  from  randomised  controlled  trials without  introducing  methodological  flaws.  However,  the  trial  population  in  Study  248.543  had  a baseline mean (SD) RLSRS total score of 23.5 (5.1) while in 248.546 the mean was 5 points higher with  28.5  (5.6),  representing  a  more  severely  affected  RLS  population,  as  well  as  the  number  of patients  already  experienced  in  RLS  treatment  was  higher  in  Study  248.546  (58.9%)  compared  to Study 248.543 (24.6%), which explains why the response rate in the populations meeting these two criteria is different. The data over time from Study 248.546 period 1 confirm that no wearing off was observed.

The CGI-I scale was applied only at the end of the open label phase prior to randomisation and cannot provide  further  insight.  Following  the  MAH's  responses  the  CHMP  agreed  with  the  conclusions reached by the MAH. However, since no placebo group was included in this trial, it is difficult to draw definite conclusions with regard to maintained efficacy.

## Study 248.515

## Methods

The main objective of the single centre study was to evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety (over 3 weeks) of different doses of pramipexole design (0.125 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg,0.75 mg) compared to placebo on periodic limb movements (PLM) and sleep parameters in patients with idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  study  performed  in  Finland  involving  109  treated  patients  comprised  of  2  periods  was  a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, fixed-dose period of 3 weeks followed by 1 week of wash-out and an open-label flexible-dose period of 26 weeks. In period 1, patients were randomised to receive once daily either placebo or 0.125 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, or 0.75 mg pramipexole for 3 weeks. All patients in the pramipexole groups started on 0.125 mg/day. For the higher dose groups, the dose was increased stepwise; the final dose was reached on Day 5 (0.25 mg), Day 9 (0.5 mg), and Day 13 (0.75 mg).

The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 3 in the periodic limb movements during time  in  bed  index  (PLMI)  representing  the  hourly  rate  of  periodic  limb  movements. Secondary endpoints were  the  change  in  RLSRS  total  score  and  the  clinical  global  impression  scale  for improvement (CGI-I), sleep parameters, and quality of life (SF-36).

## Results

## Primary endpoint - Periodic limb movements during time in bed index (PLMI)

The CHMP concluded that there was a significant reduction in periodic limb movements during sleep.

## Secondary endpoint - RLSRS total score and percentage of patients with very much improved or much improved CGI-I

The  CHMP  considered  that  although  reduction  in  RLSRS  was  a  secondary  outcome  measure,  a significant reduction in RLSRS was found in this very short study. Similar positive results were found for CGI-I. The MAH chose to compare the efficacy in terms of RSLRS change across studies.

°Adjusted (ANCOVA with treatment, pooled centre) for baseline and age.

o° p-value for difference between placebo and pramipexole within studies.

The CHMP considered that although not a primary outcome, in Study 248.515 there was a significant reduction  in  RLSRS  after  3  weeks  of  double  blind  fixed  dose  treatment.  The  pooling  of  data  from studies with different duration is questionable because of differences in design (flexible versus fixed dose) and since the efficacy of RLSRS wears off with duration of treatment within the pivotal Study 248.543. However, comparing efficacy across studies shows a consistent reduction in efficacy with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

increased trial duration. The results warrant further assessment in long term, placebo controlled trials (6-12 months).

Following the MAH's responses the CHMP considered that comparisons of results between trials with different populations and design should always be cautioned - and consequently the reasons provided by  the  MAH  (single  centre  versus  multi  centre  and  selected  population  (a  PLMS  index&gt;  5/h  at baseline) may well be involved. However they do not exclude or contradict that the differences may be related  to  trial  duration.  The  explanations  provided  by  the  MAH  do  not  exclude  that  the  observed differences between the studies are related to trial duration

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Study  248.515  was  not  designed  to  show  a  difference  in  CGI-I. However, more patients improved with pramipexole on the CGI-I compared to placebo. As for the majority of other outcome parameters, a significant placebo response was observed. The pooling of data between studies with different design and duration is questionable, however, comparison across studies for CGI-I leaves the impression of a 'wearing off effect' of pramipexole.

## Secondary endpoint - Quality of life (SF 36)

The  results  of  SF-36  standard  physical  component  scale  and  standard  mental  component  scale  are shown below. The CHMP considered that no effect on quality of life as measured with SF36 standard physical component scale and standard mental component scale could be observed. Effects on quality of life may not be pronounced after short-term treatment.

## Secondary endpoint - RLSRS total score during the open-label treatment (FAS period 2 population)

At baseline, all dose groups had similar mean RLSRS scores; the overall mean score was 23.0 ± 4.3, indicating a population with moderate to severe RLS symptoms. At the end of week 30, reductions of the mean RLSRS scores were observed in all dose groups. Overall the mean reduction of the RLSRS score was 16.9 ± 7.8.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study 248.520

## Methods

This  study  provided  short-term  (6  weeks)  and  long-term  (46  weeks)  data  on  efficacy  and  safety  of pramipexole in a multi-centre flexible-dose design (dose range 0.125 mg-0.75 mg). The first 6 weeks were a randomised parallel-group double-blind study of pramipexole (flexible-dose) vs. placebo. The focus was on clinical parameters of RLS: The co-primary endpoints were the change in the RLSRS score  from  baseline  and  CGI-Global  Improvement  after  6  weeks  of  treatment.  Patients  who  were responders after 6 weeks of treatment continued with double-blind medication for a further 46 weeks while patients who were non-responders received open-label pramipexole. Overall, 345 patients were treated in 37 centres in 5 European countries for 6 weeks.

The primary endpoints for  efficacy were the change in RLSRS total score from baseline to week 6 and the proportion of CGI-I responders (much improved, very much improved) at week 6. Secondary endpoints were ESS, PGI, quality of life (SF-36) and VAS for RLS severity.

## Results

The CHMP considered that a significant response for both primary outcome variables was observed in this short-term (6 weeks) FAS period of the trial, which was supported by several secondary outcome measures in period 1.

## 4.3 Clinical safety

A total of 889 patients with RLS received at least one dose of pramipexole and 295 patients at least one placebo dose in the course of the four studies. The planned pramipexole doses used in the RLS programme were 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mg/day.

The main analysis of adverse events (AEs) was based on data from study grouping 2 (double-blind periods), where 575 patients were treated with pramipexole and 223 patients with placebo.

The  CHMP  considered  that  discontinuation  in  the  study  248.543  due  to  adverse  events  was substantially  higher  for  pramipexole  than  for  placebo  (11.6%  in  pramipexole  and  5.8  %  in  placebo group).

Overall, the frequency of AEs in the double-blind periods of studies 248.515, 248.520, and 248.543 (study grouping 2) was higher in the pramipexole than in the placebo group, i.e., 419 (72.9%) patients in the pramipexole group and 141 (63.2%) in the placebo group experienced at least one AE. In both treatment groups, AEs most commonly belonged to the system organ class 'nervous system disorders' (30.4%  pramipexole  and  26.0%  placebo)  or  'gastointestinal  disorders'  (29.7%  pramipexole  and 13.9% placebo).

Nausea and somnolence were important adverse events - especially in the elderly population. These adverse  events  were  found  more  frequently  among  patients  treated  with  pramipexole.  The  risk  of adverse events should be put in context of the modest efficacy of pramipexole. Nausea and fatigue decreased  with  duration  of  the  trial,  which  is  expected  since  the  adverse  events  are  probably  dose related and therefore may lead to dose reduction (flexible dose) or discontinuation (fixed dose). The assumption made by the MAH that insomnia is an effect of disease rather than of the Study drug is probably  correct,  but  it  is  disappointing  that  pramipexole  did  not  have  a  positive  effect  on  this parameter. The prevalence of insomnia remained almost constant throughout the study treatment. A similar trend was observed for insomnia in patients in the placebo group, suggesting this was an effect of the disease rather than of the study drug.

In  the  pramipexole  group  in  study  grouping  2,  female  patients  had  a  higher  incidence  of  AEs  than male  patients  (77.8%  of  370  females  vs.  63.9%  of  205  males).  AEs  of  the  system  organ  class 'gastrointestinal  disorders'  were  more  frequent  in  female  (34.6%)  than  male  patients  (21.0%), whereas the frequencies of AEs in the system organ class 'nervous system disorders' were similar (31.9% females and 27.8% males). In the pramipexole group, AEs that were more frequently reported in female patients were nausea (20.8% females vs. 6.3% males) and fatigue (10.5% females vs. 5.4% males). Both AEs were also reported more frequently in the placebo group for females compared to males (nausea in placebo group: 6.7% females vs. 2.7% males; fatigue in placebo group: 7.3% females

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vs. 6.8% males). The CHMP considered that frequencies of adverse events (fatigue and nausea) should be described in the SPC in relation to gender. The following text will be included in section 4.8 of the SPC:  ' Nausea  and  fatigue  were  more  often  reported  in  female  patients  treated  with  MIRAPEXIN (20.8% and 10.5% respectively) compared to males (6.7 % and 7.3% respectively).'

The dose  relationship  of  AEs was  evaluated  for  the  fixed-dose,  double-blind  periods  of  studies 248.515 (3-week treatment period) and 248.543 (12-week treatment period), analysed by randomised treatment  group.  The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  in  the  different  dose  groups  was  similar,  i.e.,  17/21 (81.0%) patients experienced an AE with 0.125 mg compared to 85/110 (77.3%) with 0.25 mg, 81/102 (79.4%) with 0.5 mg, and 86/112 (76.8%) with 0.75 mg pramipexole. A dose relationship for AEs belonging  to  the  system  organ  class  'gastrointestinal  disorders'  and  psychiatric  disorders  was observed. The CHMP concluded that the frequency of most adverse events was related to drug dose. This confirms that the adverse events are related to pramipexole and not an effect of disease.

Twenty-nine of 889 patients (3.3%) treated with pramipexole in the four clinical studies reported at least one SAE .  All  SAEs were considered unrelated to the Study drug by the investigator. With the exception of the two fatal cases, and of two patients whose SAEs had not resolved at the close of the trial,  all  patients  recovered  from  their  episodes.  Four  of  295  patients  (1.4%)  treated  with  placebo reported  at  least  one  SAE  in  the  four  clinical  studies.  The  CHMP  considered  that  serious  adverse events were more frequent among pramipexole treated patients (3.3%) compared to placebo (1.4%), but all were considered to be unrelated to drug. Further assessment in long-term placebo controlled trials would give a possibility to assess this issue in detail.

## Clinical Laboratory Evaluations

The  following  parameters  were  evaluated:  Haematology:  Haematocrit,  haemoglobin,  red  blood  cell (RBC)  count,  mean  corpuscular  volume  (MCV),  mean  corpuscular  haemoglobin  (MCH),  mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), white blood cell (WBC) count, platelets, neutrophils, poly segment neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. Coagulation: Prothrombin time (PT), Prothrombin time-international normalised ratio´(PT-INR), and activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  (APTT).  Enzymes:  Aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST),  alanine aminotransferase  (ALT),  alkaline  phosphatase,  gamma  glutamyltransferase  (GGT),  cholinesterase, lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH),  amylase,  lipase.  Substrates:  Glucose,  total  cholesterol,  blood  urea nitrogen, creatinine, creatinine clearance, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, triglycerides, uric acid, total protein, and albumin. Electrolytes: Sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, and phosphate. Urinalysis: Protein, nitrite, glucose, ketone, RBC, WBC, blood, and pH, and further microscopic evaluations if the dip-stick  test  revealed  any  findings.  Other:  Ferritin,  iron,  thyroid  stimulating  hormone  (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroxine (T4). Across all studies (Study grouping 1), there was no - or only  marginal  -  change  in  median  values  from  baseline  to  last  assessment  for  any  laboratory parameter  in  the  pramipexole  and  placebo  groups.  The  CHMP  considered  that  clinical  laboratory evaluation does not give rise to concern with regard to safety.

## Vital signs

Overall, there were no clinically relevant changes in systolic blood pressure in both treatment groups. The CHMP considered that the effect on orthostatic reaction and pulse rate has not been sufficiently evaluated in this population. In general, there were no clinically relevant changes in the pulse rate in both treatment groups and based on frequency of adverse event reporting and the relatively low dose of pramipexole used in the RLS population, orthostatic reactions does not seem to constitute a major problem.

In  general,  there  were  no  differences  between  the  pramipexole  and  placebo  groups  with  respect  to physical examination findings. The CHMP considered that physical examination is a rough measure of adverse events - probably not sufficiently sensitive to pick up minor changes in the patients overall physical condition.

## Dermatological examinations

Of  a  total  of  316  patients  treated  with  pramipexole  in  these  studies  undergoing  dermatological examination, no case of melanoma was identified. The CHMP considered that as the studies were all short term trials, they probably were being too short to pick up any sign relating to the development of skin melanoma, however it is reassuring that no cases of melanoma occurred.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  MAH  will  continue  to  monitor  the  occurrence  of  melanoma  as  part  of  their  post  marketing surveillance and discuss respective findings in the forthcoming PSURs.

## Safety in special populations: Children

All  studies  were  performed  in  adults,  and  therefore  no  safety  data  are  available  on  the  use  of pramipexole in paediatric patients with RLS.

## Safety in special populations: Hepatically impaired patients

The  influence  of  hepatic  insufficiency  on  pramipexole  pharmacokinetics  has  not  been  evaluated. However, because approximately 90% of the recovered dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug, hepatic impairment is not expected to have a significant effect on pramipexole elimination.

## Safety in special populations: Renally impaired patients

The safety of pramipexole in renally impaired patients was assessed as part of the Parkinson's disease development programme, during which it was determined that pramipexole clearance correlates well with creatinine clearance in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Therefore, creatinine clearance can be used as a predictor of the extent of decrease in pramipexole clearance (P98-7305). No patients  with  renal  impairment  (defined  as  having  significant  renal  disease  or  creatinine  clearance lower than 50 mL/minute) were included in the RLS clinical studies.

## Safety in special populations: Elderly patients

In the RLS clinical studies, AEs were analysed by subgroups according to the age groups &lt;65 years and &gt;65 years in study grouping 2 and 4, to assess whether or not age influences the AE profile of pramipexole  in  RLS  patients.  One  AE  of  specific  interest  in  the  elderly,  based  on  data  from  the Parkinson's disease programme, was hallucination. The two patients who reported hallucination (one pramipexole, one placebo) in the RLS clinical programme were both &lt;65 years of age.

## Safety in special populations: Race

Approximately  99%  of  the  patients  included  in  the  four  clinical  studies  of  the  RLS  development programme were Caucasian. The number of patients from different race groups was too small to draw any conclusions about the influence of race on the safety profile of pramipexole.

## Safety in special populations: Pregnancy

One  pregnancy  occurred  in  the  clinical  trial  with  RLS  (0,75  mg).  The  drug  was  stopped  after  the woman tested positive. After a normal pregnancy the child was born healthy.

## Drug interactions

No new information with regard to drug interactions has been presented.

## Overdose

In the RLS clinical studies, no event of overdose was reported.

## Drug abuse

Pramipexole  has  not  been  systematically  studied  in  animals  or  humans  for  its  potential  for  abuse, tolerance,  or  physical  dependence.  The  potential  for  drug  abuse  in  the  RLS  population  may  be different  from  the  Parkinson  population,  which  is  known  to  have  a  low  abuse  potential.  Moreover, pramipexole  is  administered  in  a  much  lower  daily  dose  in  the  RLS  indication  compared  to Parkinson's  disease.  However,  the  MAH  will  monitor  the  abuse  potential  as  part  of  their  post marketing surveillance and will discuss respective findings in the forthcoming PSURs.

## Withdrawal and rebound

In  Study  248.520,  there  were  considerable  more  patients  who  experienced  RLS  symptoms  worse compared to baseline among patients treated with pramipexole (43.6%) compared to placebo (8.7%). This clearly show that rebound may be a phenomena associated with stopping pramipexole therapy. This has important implication for the interpretation of Study 248.546, since it is suspected that the effect  shown  in  this  study  was  related  to  withdrawal  and  rebound.  The  CHMP  considered  that withdrawal and rebound should be described in the SPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  MAH  considered  that  the  risk  of  rebound  is  minimal  in  this  dose  range.  In  addition,  in  most chronic diseases withdrawal of an efficacious treatment is followed by a worsening of symptoms (i.e. pain in rheumatoid arthritis, blood pressure etc.) and as this is no specific feature of pramipexole in the indication RLS, the MAH does not consider it necessary to specifically mention this in the SPC. The CHMP however still considered that rebound may be a problem after abrupt discontinuation. Thus, the following text will be added to section 4.2 of the SPC: 'Rebound (worsening of symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of treatment) can not be excluded'.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## PSUR cycle

In view of the extension of indication to RLS, the PSURs will be submitted every six months during two years, once a year for the following two years and thereafter at three-yearly intervals.

## 6. Changes to product information

## Section 4.1 of the SPC

'4.1.2  MIRAPEXIN  tablets  are  indicated  for  symptomatic  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome in dosages up to 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) (See section 4.2.2).'

## Section 4.2 of the SPC

## '4.2.2 Restless Legs Syndrome

The tablets  should  be  taken  orally,  swallowed  with  water,  and  can  be  taken  either  with  or without food.

The recommended starting dose of MIRAPEXIN is 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) taken once daily 2-3 hours before bedtime. For patients requiring additional symptomatic relief, the dose may be increased every 4-7 days to a maximum of 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) per day (as shown in the table below).

| Dose Schedule of MIRAPEXIN   | Dose Schedule of MIRAPEXIN           | Dose Schedule of MIRAPEXIN           |

As long-term efficacy of MIRAPEXIN in the treatment of RLS has not been sufficiently tested, patient's response should be evaluated after 3 months treatment and treatment continuation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

should  be  reconsidered.  If  treatment  is  interrupted  for  more  than  a  few  days  it  should  be re-initiated by dose titration carried out as above.

## Treatment discontinuation

Since daily dose for the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome will not exceed 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) MIRAPEXIN can be discontinued without tapering off. Rebound (worsening of symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of treatment) can-not be  excluded.'

## Dosing in patients with renal impairment

The  elimination  of  pramipexole  is  dependent  on  renal  function.  Patients  with  a  creatinine clearance above 20 mL/min require no reduction in daily dose. The use of MIRAPEXIN has not been studied in hemodialysis patients, or in patients with severe renal impairment.

## Dosing in patients with hepatic impairment

Dose adjustments in patients with hepatic failure is not required, as approx. 90% of adsorbed drug is excreted through the kidneys.'

## Section 4.4 of the SPC

'Reports in the literature indicate that treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome with dopaminergic  medications  can  result  in  augmentation.  Augmentation  refers  to  the  earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or even the afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other extremities. The controlled trials of MIRAPEXIN in patients with Restless  Legs  Syndrome  were  generally  not  of  sufficient  duration  to  adequately  capture augmentation  phenomena.  The  frequency  of  augmentation  after  longer  use  of  MIRAPEXIN and  the  appropriate  management  of  these  events  have  not  been  evaluated  in  controlled clinical trials.'

## Section 4.6 of the SPC

In  the  absence  of  human  data,  MIRAPEXIN  should  not  be  used  during  breast-feeding,  if possible.

## Section 4.8 of the SPC

'The  following  side  effects  are  expected  under  the  use  of  MIRAPEXIN:  confusional  state, constipation, dizziness, dyskinesias, fatigue, hallucinations, headache, hypotension, insomnia, libido disorders, nausea, peripheral oedema, pathological gambling, somnolence, and sudden onset of sleep.

Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled trials, comprising a total of 1923 patients on  MIRAPEXIN  and  1354  patients  on  placebo,  adverse  drug  reactions  were  frequently reported for both groups. 63 % of patients on MIRAPEXIN and 52% of patients on placebo reported at least one adverse drug reaction.

Tables  1  and  2  display  the  frequency  of  adverse  reactions  from  placebo-controlled  clinical trials in Parkinson's disease and Restless Legs Syndrome. The adverse reactions reported in these  tables  are  those  events  that  occurred  in  1%  or  more  of  patients  treated  with MIRAPEXIN and were reported significantly more often in patients taking MIRAPEXIN than placebo,  or  where  the  event  was  considered  clinically  relevant.  However,  the  majority  of common adverse reactions were mild  to  moderate,  they  usually  start  early  in  therapy,  and most tended to disappear even as therapy was continued.

MIRAPEXIN is associated with somnolence (8.6%) and has been associated uncommonly with excessive daytime somnolence and sudden sleep onset episodes (0.1%). See also 4.4.

MIRAPEXIN may be associated with libido disorders (increased (0.1%) or decreased (0.4%)).

As described in literature for dopamine agonists used for treatment of Parkinson's disease, patients treated with MIRAPEXIN, especially at high doses, have been reported as showing pathological gambling, generally reversible upon treatment discontinuation.

The most commonly ( ≥ 5%)  reported  adverse  reaction  in  patients  with  Parkinson's  disease treated  with  Mirapexin  were  dizziness,  dyskinesia,  somnolence,  insomnia,  hallucination, confusional state and constipation. The incidence of somnolence is increased at doses higher than  1.5  mg/day  (see  section  4.2.1).  More  frequent  adverse  reactions  in  combination  with levodopa were dyskinesias. Hypotension may occur at the beginning of treatment, especially if MIRAPEXIN is titrated too fast.

The  most  commonly  ( ≥ 5%) reported  adverse  reaction  in  patients  with  Restless  Legs Syndrome  treated  with  Mirapexin  were  nausea,  headache  and  fatigue.  Nausea  and  fatigue were  more  often  reported  in  female  patients  treated  with  MIRAPEXIN  (20.8%  and  10.5%, respectively) compared to males (6.7 % and 7.3%, respectively).

## Section 4.9 of the SPC

There is no clinical experience with massive overdosage. The expected adverse events would be  those  related  to  the  pharmacodynamic  profile  of  a  dopamine  agonist,  including  nausea, vomiting,  hyperkinesia,  hallucinations,  agitation  and  hypotension.  There  is  no  established antidote for overdosage of a dopamine agonist. If signs of central nervous system stimulation are present, a neuroleptic agent may be indicated. Management of the overdose may require general supportive measures, along with gastric lavage, intravenous fluids, electrocardiogram monitoring and administration of activated charcoal.

## Section 5.1 of the SPC

'The  mechanism  of  action  of  pramipexole  as  treatment  for  Restless  Legs  Syndrome  is unknown. Neuropharmacological evidence suggests primary dopaminergic system involvement.

'Current evidence favours a disinhibition of normal CNS pacemakers, probably governed by multiple  influences  that  may  relate  to  PLM  and  disruptions  in  sleep  and  periodic  leg movements.'

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical trials in Restless Legs Syndrome

The  efficacy  of  MIRAPEXIN  was  evaluated  in  four  placebo-controlled  clinical  trials  in approximately 1000 patients with moderate to very severe idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome. Efficacy  was  demonstrated  in  controlled  trials  in  patients  treated  for  up  to  12  weeks. Maintenance of effect has not been sufficiently tested..

The mean change from baseline in the Restless Legs Syndrome Rating Scale (IRLS) and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) were the primary efficacy outcome measures. For both primary endpoints statistically significant differences have been observed for the pramipexole dose groups 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg and 0.75 mg in comparison to placebo. After 12 weeks of treatment the baseline IRLS score improved from 23.5 to 14.1 points for placebo and from 23.4 to 9.4 points for pramipexole (doses combined). The adjusted mean difference was  -4.3  points  (CI  95%  -6.4;  -2.1  points,  p-value  &lt;0.0001).  CGI-I  responder  rates (improved,  very  much  improved)  were  51.2%  and  72.0  %  for  placebo  and  pramipexole respectively (difference 20% CI 95%:  8.1%; 31.8%, p&lt;0.0005). Efficacy was observed with 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) per day after the first week of treatment.

In  a  placebo-controlled  polysomnography  study  over  3  weeks  MIRAPEXIN  significantly reduced the number of periodic limb movements during time in bed.

Compared to placebo, the patients treated with MIRAPEXIN reached statistically significant superiority  in  terms  of  sleep  satisfaction,  improvement  in  their  condition  while  getting  to sleep, during the night and day as measured by Visual Analogue Scales.'

## Section 1 of the PL

MIRAPEXIN 1.1 mg tablets are taken by patients to treat moderate to severe idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome.

## Section 2 of the PL

If you are treated for  Restless Legs Syndrome and if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed, in particular those which affect kidney function or are excreted by the kidneys, e.g. cimetidine, or drugs that may cause drowsiness (somnolence), or alcohol please inform your doctor or pharmacist.pharmacist.

## Section 3 of the PL

'Mirapexin tablets 0.088 mg tablets are only for adults and should not be taken by children and adolescents up to 18 years.

Always take Mirapexin tablets exactly as your doctor has instructed you. You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure.

Swallow the tablets with a glass of water.

At the beginning of treatment you will start by taking one Mirapexin 0.088 mg tablet once daily 2-3 hours before bedtime. If this dose is not sufficient to relieve symptoms, your doctor may recommend to increase the dose gradually every 4-7 days to 0.18 mg, 0.35 mg or 0.54 mg per day.

Response to treatment should be evaluated after 3 month treatment and the need for treatment continuation should be reconsidered. If treatment is interrupted for more than a few days it should be re-initiated gradually as advised above.

If you have impaired kidney function, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.

If you have to stop taking this medicine, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.

Effects when treatment with Mirapexin 0.088 mg tablets is stopped :

If the treatment with SIFROL is abruptly stopped, symptoms like fever, rigidity, increased heart rate and/or disturbance of consciousness can occur (see 'Parkinson's disease').

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In patients treated with doses up to 0.54 mg of pramipexole base or 0.75 mg of pramipexole salt for RLS SIFROL can be stopped without tapering off. However, worsening of symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of treatment may occur in isolated cases.

## Readability test

According to Art. 59(3) and 61(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, the MAH should provide the results  of  assessments  carried  out  in  cooperation  with  target  patient  groups  on  the  PL  ('user consultation')  or  give  a  justification  for  not  performing  such  consultation.  The  MAH  provided  a justification  for  not  providing  a  readability  test  based  on  the  fact  that  the  product  has  been  on  the market in the EU for 7.5 years and that during this time, no problems have been reported with the use of  Mirapexin or understanding of the PL. The MAH therefore did not see an immediate need for a readability  test  in  RLS  patients.  The  CHMP  did  not  consider  the  MAH's  justification  for  not performing a readability test acceptable, especially since the PL will now comprise of two different indications/populations. The MAH has committed to submit a readability test of the English PL postauthorisation.

## 7. Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment

## Efficacy

Short-term (3  months) efficacy in the co-primary endpoints RLSRS total score and CGI-I response was  shown  in  4  randomised  double-blind  placebo  controlled  trials  including  approximately  1000 patients administered pramipexole up to 12 weeks for the treatment of moderate to severe RLS. The periodic limb movements during sleep and RLS severity at bedtime during night and day were reduced and the sleep measured by VAS improved during treatment.

As  the  efficacy  varied  with  disease  severity,  being  most  pronounced  in  the  severely  affected,  the benefit in the mildly affected population was questionable. The CHMP considered that the proposed indication be amended in the following way to apply to the restricted moderate to severe population: 'MIRAPEXIN  tablets  are  indicated  for  symptomatic  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome in dosages up to 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt)'.

Efficacy  was  shown  to  wear  off  with  treatment  duration.  Moreover,  efficacy  was  not  seen  with increased dose, whereas adverse events and drop-outs increased. Thus, the following text is added to section 4.2 of the SPC: 'As long-term efficacy of Mirapexin in the treatment of RLS has not yet been sufficiently  tested,  patients'  response  should  evaluated  after  3  months  treatment  and  the  need  for treatment continuation should be reconsidered' .

Efficacy has not been shown in long-term trials. The open-label extensions of the placebo-controlled trials cannot be used to show long-term efficacy, but be regarded as supportive of the findings. The MAH has committed to perform a study of 6 months duration post-authorisation.

## Safety

No new clinically meaningful safety issues could be identified in the RLS population in comparison to the adverse event profile of pramipexole in Parkinson's disease.

Nausea,  fatigue  and  headache  were  reported  most  frequently  and  in  higher  frequencies  with pramipexole  compared  to  placebo.  Nausea  and  fatigue  were  also  more  often  reported  in  female patients (20.8% and 10.5% respectively) compared to males (6.7% and 7.3% respectively).

Augmentation /rebound following abrupt discontinuation of treatment cannot be excluded. However, no firm conclusions on the occurrence can be drawn given the methodological limitations of the used scale of the study duration. A general precautionary statement in the section 4.2 of the SPC clarifying that  as  with  other  dopamine  agonists  augmentation  may  occur  with  pramipexole  is  considered appropriate: 'Rebound (worsening of symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of treatment) cannot be excluded' .

As  part  of  the  pharmacological  action  of  dopamine  agonists,  the  occurrence  of  hallucinations  and orthostatic hypotension cannot be excluded for RLS. This also applied to sudden onset of sleep, where a respective warning has been included in the SPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Benefit/risk

The CHMP considered that the benefit risk profile for the use of pramipexole in moderate to severe RLS is considered positive, as therapeutic benefit was shown in the controlled trials with acceptable adverse events.

The CHMP considered that this variation to extend the indication to include 'MIRAPEXIN tablets are indicated  for  symptomatic  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  idiopathic Restless  Legs  Syndrome  in dosages up to 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt)' , with consequential changes to the sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC was acceptable.
