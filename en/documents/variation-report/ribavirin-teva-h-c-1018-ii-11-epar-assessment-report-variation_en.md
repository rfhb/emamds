## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Ribavirin is a purine nucleoside analogue which is active against a number of DNA and RNA viruses. There are several proposed mechanisms of action for ribavirin. These include indirect effects such as inhibition of inosine monophosphate and immunomodulatory effects, and direct effects such as polymerase inhibition and interference with viral RNA capping.

Ribavirin Teva is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (HCV) virus infection in adults, children 3 years of age and older and adolescents and must only be used as part of a combination regimen with interferon alfa-2b. Ribavirin Teva 200 mg hard capsules (EMEA/H/C/1018) was authorised via the centralised procedure in 2009 under article 10(1) of directive 2001/83/EC. The application was supported by a single pivotal bioequivalence study conducted to determine bioequivalence with the EU reference product Rebetol (study R07-1285). The samples for this study were analysed at Cetero Research facilities in Houston (Texas). Following an inspection of Cetero Research facilities in Houston (Texas), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) raised major concerns about the conduct of bio-analytical studies in the period April 2005 to June 2010. In November 2011 the EMA notified the concerned Marketing Authorisation Holders that bio-analytical studies conducted by Cetero Research in that period in support of marketing authorisation applications may need to be repeated or confirmed. The issue was subsequently assessed in an Article 20 referral procedure, and based on the CHMP scientific assessment (opinion adopted on 20 September 2012), the EC decided to suspend the marketing authorisation of Ribavirin Teva, as of 06 December 2012. The MAH was also requested to not release further batches of the medicinal product until the results of a new bioequivalence study are available. The Annex II of the Article 20 Opinion 'Conditions for lifting the suspension' specified that, in order to lift the suspension, the MAH should provide adequate and satisfactory data confirming the bioequivalence of their product with the reference product within one year of the Commission decision. Accordingly, the MAH repeated the pivotal study (R07-1285) which had supported the initial MAA for Ribavirin Teva 200 mg hard capsules. This application has been submitted as a type II variation (classification C.I.z) to provide the clinical study report for the repeat bioequivalence study performed in response to the Article 20 CHMP referral opinion. Study P12-1096 (S12-0221) was a relative bioavailability study of Ribavirin Teva 200 mg capsules versus Rebetol 200 mg capsules under fed conditions. 2.2.

Study title

Certificates of analysis (CoAs) of both the test and reference product as tested by Teva/MSD are provided. Impurities are below the reporting threshold for the test product and not reported for the reference product. During the procedure MAH was asked to confirm that the test product was manufactured according to the approved manufacturing method and at a batch size of at least 100,000 tablets or 1/10 of the commercial scale and complies with the requirements of the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/QWP/1401/98). The MAH confirmed that the batch size of the test product used in the bioequivalence study was a commercial scale batch and was manufactured to the approved manufacturing method. In vitro dissolution During the procedure the MAH was requested to provide in vitro dissolution data, in line with the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/QWP/1401/98). While the CHMP recognised that this was initially demonstrated for the batches used in the disregarded bioequivalence study, acceptable data should also be provided for the biobatches used in the new bioequivalence study. In response to this request the MAH has performed comparative in vitro dissolution testing of the test product batch R52012 against the reference product batch 2RCJA14A03 used in the bioequivalence study S12-0221 in pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 and the media used for product release (water). The dissolution method used was the same method that is currently registered for routine quality control (QC) batch release. Data are presented for the two batches used in bioequivalence study P12-1096 (S12-0221). Dissolution data are also provided in tabulated form (n=12). Drug release is &gt;85 % in 15 minutes in all pH media including the QC medium (water), so that, in line with the guideline (CPMP/QWP/1401/98), F2 values do not need to be calculated.  Release is comparable between the various dissolution media (water, 0.1N HCl and in buffered medium at pH 4.5 and 6.8) and the two formulations. Relative standard deviation (RSD) is not more than (NMT) 5.7 % for each time point. The dissolution profiles are supportive of the bioequivalence claims and the in vivo data. 2.3. Clinical Pharmacology aspects 2.3.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted A single bioequivalence study was submitted in support of this application, study P12-1096 (S12-0221). The study was performed at the PRACS Institute. 'An open-label, single dose, randomised, 2-way crossover bioequivalence study of  Ribavirin Teva 200 mg capsules versus Rebetol 200 mg capsules following a single dose in healthy subjects under fed conditions'. Study design Medicinal product no longer authorised

The study was a randomised, single dose, open-label, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, crossover bioequivalence study in healthy, adult male and female subjects under fed conditions.

Population studied and clinical part of the study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Thirty healthy, non-smoking male and female volunteers aged 18 years and older were entered in the study. Subjects' body mass indices (BMI) were within 18.5 and 30 kg/m 2 . All subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two sequences in a balanced manner. The drug randomisation scheme was computer-generated and was provided.

Assuming a 25% intra-subject variability for Cmax of ribavirin, and a difference between the treatment means of 5% or less, the necessary sample size for a 80% probability of the 90% confidence interval (CI) of the treatment means ratio to be within the conventional limits was estimated to be 28 subjects. Two extra subjects were included in the study to account for potential dropouts.

For the statistical analysis, subject sample values below the lower limit of quantification (BLQ) were reported as zero. For pharmacokinetics (PK) calculations, BLQ values were treated as zero when occurring at the beginning of the concentration profile. BLQ values were treated as missing when occurring at the end of the concentration profile or between two detectable concentration values.

Thirty healthy adult subjects were thus enrolled in the study, and 28 subjects completed the clinical part of the study in its entirety. Subject 001 was dropped from the study because they did not show up for Period II check-in and subject 030 elected to withdraw from the study during Period I due to an adverse event (paronychia). Data from these two subjects were excluded from the final ribavirin analysis, i.e. plasma concentration data from 28 of 30 subjects were used in the final statistical analysis for ribavirin. Subjects fasted overnight for at least 10 hours prior to drug administration and for at least 4 hours following drug administration. During each period, and 30 minutes after a standardised high-fat high-calorie meal, each subject received one of the following: one capsule of Ribavirin Teva 200 mg or one capsule of Rebetol, 200 mg, MSD, taken with 240 ml of water. Standardised meals were provided to subjects at 4 hours and 10 hours after drug administration in each period. Blood samples were collected within 90 minutes prior to each subject's scheduled dose time (0 hour) and after dose administration at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours while subjects were confined to the clinic. Subjects returned to the clinic for blood samples at 36, 48 and 72 hours post-dose. The wash-out between period 1 and 2 was 35 days. The actual time of sample collection was documented. The investigator states that the study was conducted in accordance with ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and ICH Guidance on Good Clinical Practice. In addition, it is stated that the study was carried out in accordance with the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. The bioanalytical method used in the study was a LC-MS/MS method which was validated in 2012. Pharmacokinetic variables and statistical methods Pharmacokinetic parameters for ribavirin plasma concentration were calculated with SAS using standard non-compartmental approaches. Since ribavirin exhibits a long terminal elimination half-life, a truncated design at 72 hours was used. Descriptive statistics were estimated for the pharmacokinetic parameters in each treatment. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to log-transformed AUC0-72h and Cmax. The ANOVA model included sequence, formulation and period as fixed effects and subject nested within sequence as a random effect. Sequence was tested using subject nested within sequence as the error term. A 10% level of significance was used to test the sequence effect. Bioequivalence was to be declared if the test/reference ratios of geometric means of Cmax and AUC0-72h, and their 90% CIs, were all contained in the interval 80.00 to 125.00%. Medicinal product no longer authorised

There was a significant period effect observed for ln-transformed AUC0-72h (p=0.0081). This statistically significant period effect is likely due to an error in Type-I testing. There was no statistically significant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

period effect observed for ln-transformed Cmax. There were no statistically significant sequence effects observed for ln-transformed AUC0-72h or ln-transformed Cmax.

## 2.3.2. Results

The results of study S12-0221 are summarised in figure 1 and table 3 below. The test/reference ratio of the geometric means of Cmax and AUC0-72h and their 90% CIs were all contained in the interval 80.00 to 125.00%.

<!-- image -->

Nevertheless, since for both patients only one data point is missing, the CHMP requested that the analysis should be repeated with both subjects included. When data for subjects 007 and 025 are included, the % geometric mean ratio of ln-transformed data for AUC0-72h and Cmax were 103.20 (90% CI: 100.71 105.74) and 105.36 (90% CI: 99.30 -111.80), respectively. This re-calculation indicates that inclusion of the data for subjects 007 and 025 does not change the conclusions regarding the bioequivalence of test and reference product.

Figure 1. Mean plasma concentrations (0-72 hours) for ribavirin (n=28) Table 3. Geometric means, ratios of means, and 90% confidence intervals of ln-transformed ribavirin data for test product A versus reference product B (n=28) Plasma concentration curves were provided by subject and by drug, on both linear and semi-logarithmic scale. Plasma concentration data from subjects who withdrew or were discontinued for any reason were not used in the final analysis. Subjects 007 and 025 had missing samples in Period II, Hour 72 and these were treated as missing concentrations in the PK analysis. AUC0-72h was therefore not calculated for Subjects 007 and 025, in line with guideline CPMP/QWP/1404/98 Rev. 1/Corr and the PRACS Institute SOP 'When to Use AUC Truncation in BA/BE Studies'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Regarding other PK parameters, the MAH also presented Tmax; however due to the truncated study design at 72 hours (i.e. less than one expected half-life of ribavirin of approximately 79 hrs), the elimination rate constant and terminal elimination half-life (t ½) could not be calculated.

## 2.3.3. Discussion

## Study design and conduct aspects:

Ribavirin is an immediate-release formulation. According to the SmPC, the product should be taken with food. A single-dose bioequivalence study in the fed state is appropriate. Only one strength of capsules was applied for, the biowaiver is not applicable. The strength tested is the same as the recommended dose and is acceptable. Upon request, the MAH confirmed that the batch size of test product used in the bioequivalence study was a commercial scale batch and was manufactured to the approved manufacturing method, and thus complies with the requirements of the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/QWP/1404/98). Also upon request, the MAH has provided the results of dissolution tests with the batches of the test and reference products used in the study, which also demonstrate compliance with the above guideline. The reference product used in the bioequivalence study is acceptable. The design of the study and the population chosen are appropriate. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were presented and are acceptable. The randomisation scheme was provided. The sampling period and sampling scheme seem adequate to estimate PK parameter of an immediate-release formulation. Considering the elimination half-life of ribavirin, the washout period of 35 days is expected to be long enough to avoid any carry-over effects. There were several protocol deviations relating to the sample time and documentation failures for the time of placement of the blood samples into the freezer. Deviations from the scheduled sampling time were accounted for in the pharmacokinetic calculations since the actual sampling times were used. The investigator considers that the protocol violations described do not have a significant impact on the results. Ribavirin plasma concentrations were measured using a validated bioanalytical method and according to the bioanalytical laboratory's SOP. The pharmacokinetic variables follow the current European standard and are appropriate for this study. The statistical methods are adequately described. The protocol specified 80.00-125.00% as criteria for bioequivalence in line with the bioequivalence guideline. The data evaluation follows regulatory standards. Of note, the MAH chose to truncate the AUC at 72h instead of using AUC0-t. Ribavirin is a drug with a long plasma concentration half-life and a truncated AUC is in line with the revised bioequivalence guideline (CPMP/QWP/1401/98), which states that AUC0-72h may be used as the absorption phase has been covered by 72 h for immediate-release formulations. Clinical pharmacology aspects: The statistical analysis of the pharmacokinetic results of study S12-0221 demonstrates that the point estimates of the test/reference ratio of geometric means for ln-transformed AUC0-72h and Cmax and their 90% CIs were all contained within the acceptance interval of 80.00% to 125.00% defined in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/QWP/1401/98). Medicinal product no longer authorised

The point estimates and their 90% CIs also remained within the acceptance interval of 80.00% to 125.00% when including in the calculations subjects 07 and 025 who were excluded from the original statistical analysis of AUC0-72h due to a missing data point.

There was one subject with a positive plasma concentrations at the beginning of period 2, however the plasma concentration relative to Cmax was low (&lt;1.5%). This is not considered to significantly affect the study results. In compliance with the protocol, all pre-dose levels were maintained in the pharmacokinetic analysis without baseline correction.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The number of repeated samples was low (&lt;3%), and the reasons given for repeating were appropriate.

## 2.4. Clinical Safety aspects

## 2.4.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

Subjects who successfully completed the study were exposed once to the Ribavirin 200 mg capsule and once to the Rebetol 200 mg capsule for a total of 400 mg of drug exposure throughout study conduct.

On 16 July 2012 the EC initiated a referral procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/200 for Ribavirin Teva, due to concerns regarding the reliability and correctness of data for studies conducted at the Cetero Research facilities in Houston (Texas, USA), which included the critical pivotal bioequivalence study submitted in support of the marketing authorisation of this medicinal product. In the referral procedure, the CHMP concluded that the available data gave rise to serious doubts as to the evidence of the bioequivalence of Ribavirin Teva with the EU reference product and that the benefit-risk balance of Ribavirin Teva cannot be considered to be positive under normal conditions of use. The CHMP thus recommended the suspension of the marketing authorisation. For the suspension to be lifted, the MAH for

2.4.2. Results Five subjects reported a total of 8 adverse events (AEs) across all treatments over the course of the study. The AEs were mild in intensity. A total of 3 mild AEs were reported by subjects after they received the Ribavirin Teva 200 mg capsule. A total of 5 mild AEs were reported by subjects after they received the Rebetol 200 mg capsule. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported over the course of this study. Subject 030 elected to withdraw due to the AE of paronychia. Overall, the most common AEs reported were headache and nasal congestion. Headache was reported on at least one occasion in 2 (2/30) subjects (6.7%) and was considered by the Investigator to have a reasonable possibility of relationship to the treatment in two instances and to have no reasonable possibility of relationship to the treatment in one instance. Nasal congestion was reported on one occasion in 2 (2/30) subjects (6.7%) and was considered by the Investigator to have no reasonable possibility of relationship to the treatment. After administration of the Ribavirin Teva 200 mg capsule, abdominal pain upper was reported on one occasion by 1 (1/29) subject (3.5%) and was considered by the Investigator to have no reasonable possibility of relationship to the administration of the test product. Headache was reported on one occasion by 1 (1/29) subject (3.5%) and was considered by the Investigator to have a reasonable possibility of relationship to the administration of the test product. Nasal congestion was reported on one occasion by 1 (1/29) subject (3.5%) and was considered by the Investigator to have no reasonable possibility of relationship to the administration of the test product. After administration of the Rebetol 200 mg capsule, headache was reported on one occasion by 2 (2/29) subjects (6.9%) and was considered by the Investigator to have a reasonable possibility of relationship to the administration of the reference product in one instance and to have no reasonable possibility of relationship in the other instance. Nasal congestion, paronychia, and respiratory tract congestion were reported on one occasion by 1 (1/29) subject (3.5%) each and were considered by the Investigator to have no reasonable possibility of relationship to the administration of the reference product. 2.4.3. Discussion Overall, Ribavirin Teva was well tolerated as a single oral dose of 200 mg (1 × 200 mg capsule) administered to healthy adult subjects under fed conditions. 3. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Ribavirin Teva was requested to provide adequate and satisfactory data confirming the bioequivalence of their product with the reference product.

Accordingly, with this type II variation and in order to lift the MA suspension, the MAH has submitted the clinical study report for a repeat bioequivalence study conducted to confirm bioequivalence of their product with the EU reference product.

| Variation requested                                                                                  | Type   |

| C.I.z C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation | II     |

The MAH has conducted a standard bioequivalence study with a two-period, two-sequence crossover design, which was in line with the relevant Guideline and GCP requirements, and which the CHMP considered adequate to address the bioequivalence of an immediate-release oral formulation. A single-dose study in fed subjects was appropriate as the SmPC states that ribavirin should be taken with food. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. The test formulation of Ribavirin Teva (200 mg capsules) met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with the reference formulation Rebetol of MSD, administered as a single dose under fed conditions. Bioequivalence of the two formulations can thus be accepted. The MAH has thus, as requested in the Conditions for lifting the suspension annexed to the Article 20 referral opinion, provided adequate and satisfactory data confirming the bioequivalence of Ribavirin Teva with the reference product. The CHMP is therefore of the opinion that · the benefit-risk balance of Ribavirin Teva can be considered positive under normal conditions of use · the particulars supporting the application as provided in Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC can be considered correct and therefore recommends the lifting of the suspension of the marketing authorisation. Furthermore, the CHMP considers that this variation implements changes to the decision granting the marketing authorisation due to a significant public health concern on the following grounds: this variation was submitted to lift the suspension of the marketing authorisation. 4. Recommendations Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change: Variation requested Submission of a repeat bioequivalence study performed in response to the article 20 CHMP referral opinion in order to lift the suspension of the marketing authorisation.
