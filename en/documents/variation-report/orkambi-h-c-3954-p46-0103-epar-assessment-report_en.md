## 1. Introduction

On 20 November 2019, the MAH submitted a post-approval Observational Study to Evaluate the Longterm Effectiveness  and  Safety  of  Orkambi  (Study  120),  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure REC 10.1, recommendation to submit a final clinical study report of Study VX16 809 120.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that Study VX16 809 120 is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2. Clinical aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

At the time of the initial Orkambi approval in the EU, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) requested the MAH to explore the possibility of a longer follow-up (i.e. 5 years) of study population enrolled in the phase 3 study (study 105) submitted in support of the indication in patients 12 years and older.

Because  the  majority  of  subjects  had  completed  Study  105  at  the  time  of  this  request,  Vertex determined  that  extending  this  study  for  an  additional  3  years  was  not  feasible  and  has  explored alternative approaches to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy in this population. Vertex explored the  feasibility  of  identifying  and  evaluating  Study  105  participants  via  existing  national  CF  patient registries in US and EU. In general, to fulfill the study objectives, only large, research-experienced CF patient registries with broad national CF patient coverage, high quality standard data collection, and timely data availability can be used. The registries initially meeting these criteria included US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR), the largest CF patient registry worldwide, and a number of  CF  patient  registries  in  EU  countries.  Based  on  further  assessment  of  feasibility,  evaluated  EU registries were considered not suitable for the purposes of the study due to various reasons, including low national coverage (e.g., Spain, 50%), significant data availability lags and/or data quality issues (e.g.,  Italy;  as  of  2017,  the  most  recent  data  available  are  from  2014),  or  very  small  Study  105 patient  pool  (e.g.,  UK,  France,  Germany,  Sweden,  Austria,  and  Denmark).  Because  a  significant proportion of subjects who completed Study 105 Part A were from the US (N = 485; 53%), Vertex conducted Study 120 that followed only US subjects from Study 105 who were also enrolled in the US CFFPR for 3 years after the completion of Study 105.

Study 105 was a 96-week, Phase 3, parallel-group, multicentre, rollover study in subjects with CF, homozygous or heterozygous for F508del, who participated in Study 103 or Study 104 (homozygous subjects) or in Cohort 4 of Study 102 (heterozygous subjects). Study 105 Part A (referred to hereafter as Study 105) enrolled subjects from Studies 103 and 104, who were 12 years and older at screening in parent studies.

In Study 105 Part A treatment cohort, a total of 1030 subjects were enrolled of whom, 1029 subjects were dosed with LUM/IVA: 513 subjects received LUM 600 mg once daily (qd) with IVA (179 subjects received placebo in the previous study) and 516 subjects received LUM 400 mg every 12 hours (q12h) with  IVA  (176  subjects  received  placebo  in  the  previous  study).  Subjects  who  received  LUM/IVA  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study 103 or 104 continued to receive the same dose and regimen of study drug in a double-blind fashion in Study 105 for 96 weeks in order to maintain the blind from the previous studies. Subjects who received placebo in Study 103 or 104 were randomized (1:1) to 1 of the 2 double-blind treatment groups.  Randomization  was  stratified  by  age  (&lt;18  versus  ≥18  years  of  age),  sex  (male  versus female), and percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) severity (&lt;70% versus ≥70% predicted) collected at baseline or the Screening Visit of the subject's previous study.

As regard to the recommended Orkambi dose arm, 340 patients continued treatment with lumacaftor 400  mg  every  12  h/ivacaftor  250  mg  every  12  h;  176  patients  who  had  received  placebo  in  the parental studies (TRANSPORT or TRAFFIC studies) initiated treatment with lumacaftor 400 mg every 12 h/ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 h. These results have been published (Konstan et al, Lancet Respir Med,  2017)  and  in  the  publication  the  estimated  annual  rate  of  decline  in  percent  predicted  FEV1 (ppFEV1) in  treated  patients  was  compared  with  that  of  a  matched  registry  cohort  (Supplementary material to Konstan et al. Lancet Respir Med 2016; published online Dec 20).

The focus of the efficacy in the final analysis of Study 105 was based on the Cumulative Study Period, which starts from the first dose of the study drug in the previous study to the last day in Study 105. The  analysis  for  efficacy  endpoints  was  focused  on  within-group  comparisons.  No  between  groups comparisons were performed. The interpretation of Study 105 results is hampered by a large amount of missing data (mostly due to US patients who transitioned to commercially available Orkambi), and a combination of previous and current study periods.

Among the 1029 dosed subjects,  411  (39.9%)  completed  treatment  and  618  (60.1%)  prematurely discontinued treatment; the incidence of discontinuation was similar across all 4 treatment groups. The majority of discontinuations after Week 60 were US patients who transitioned to commercially available Orkambi.  Because  the  decrease  in  sample  size  could  affect  the  robustness  of  data  analyses,  the primary efficacy analyses were performed using data up to Week 72 of Study 105. Sensitivity analyses included data up to Week 96. Although the efficacy seems to be sustained during the initial 24 weeks, a  trend  of  decaying  beyond  Week  24  was  observed  in  Study  105:  for  subjects  who  received  active treatment in both Study 103/104 and Study 105, the improvements in ppFEV1 from previous study baseline during Study 103/104 were generally sustained in Study 105 up to Extension Week 36 for L600qd/I group and Extension Week 24 for L400q12h/I group. The improvement in ppFEV1 decreased over  time  in  both  groups  with  small/no  improvement  in  ppFEV1  at  Extension  Week  96.  The  least square (LS) mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 for the L400q12h/I group (the authorized dose  for  this  age  group)  was  1.6  percentage  points  (P  =  0.0012)  at  Week  60;  at  Week  72,  the L400q12h/I  group  result  was  numerically  above  baseline  but  lacked  within-treatment  statistical significance (P = 0.2806).

However,  the  treatment  with  LUM/IVA  (L400q12h/I)  in  Study  105  showed  a  slower  annual  rate  of ppFEV1 decline (-1.33 percentage points/year) vs.  matched controls using data from 2012 to 2014 obtained from the US CFFPR (-2.29 percentage points/year).

For  the  L400q12h/I group, the c hange in BMI was 0∙69 kg/m 2   (95%CI: 0∙56 to 0∙81) at extension week 72 and 0∙96 kg/m 2  (95%CI: 0∙81 to 1∙1 1) at extension week 96, thus the effect was maintained with  respect  to  baseline.  The  annualised  pulmonary  exacerbation  (PEX)  rate  in  patients  continuing treatment  through extension  week  96  (0∙65  events  per  patient -year,  95%CI:  0∙56  to  0∙75) for  the L400q12h/I group remained lower than the PBO rate in pivotal trials, (Study 103/104: 1.19 events per patient-year).

The  introduction  in  Study  105  of  study  drugs  to  the  LUM/IVA-naïve  subjects  from  Study  103/104 confirms reproducibility of efficacy.

## 2.2.2. Clinical study

## A Post-approval Observational Study to Evaluate the Long-term Effectiveness and Safety of Orkambi in US Patients Who Completed Study VX12-809-105 Part A

## Description

## Methods

## Objective

To evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of Orkambi in US patients who completed Study 105 using secondary data from the US CFFPR.

## Study design

This was a 3-year observational study for the cohort A of Study 105 US subjects who were enrolled in the US CFFPR and provided consent for their US CFFPR data to be evaluated by the MAH.

Annual registry data from 2016 through 2018 were evaluated, ensuring 3 years of US CFFPR follow-up among subjects who completed Study 105.

## Study population /Sample size

US subjects who completed treatment with LUM/IVA in Study 105, who continued to be treated with Orkambi,  were  enrolled  in  the  US  CFFPR,  and  provided  consent  for  their  US  CFFPR  data  to  be evaluated.

Inclusion criteria, patients:

1. were homozygous for F508del;
2. completed Part A of Study 105;
3. consented to have their data evaluated; and
4. had evidence of treatment with Orkambi following completion of Study 105 (as captured in the US CFFPR).

Patients who met the inclusion criteria are hereafter referred to as the Orkambi Cohort.

Sample  size :  a  total  of 485 subjects  from  the  US  completed  Study  105  and  were  eligible  to participate in Study 120 if they continued to be treated with Orkambi, were enrolled in the US CFFPR, and provided consent for their US CFFPR data to be evaluated.

## Treatments Exposure

Orkambi exposure after the date of Study 105 completion for each patient was determined based on the record of Orkambi treatment as identified in the US CFFPR. Patients were considered to remain exposed to Orkambi until there was no evidence of treatment in the US CFFPR.

Precise  Orkambi  treatment  initiation  and  discontinuation  dates  were  not  available  in  the  US  CFFPR. Because start and stop dates were not available from the US CFFPR, the algorithm to extrapolate the duration of exposure included the following rules: the date of the first encounter (evidence of Orkambi

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

exposure)  was  used  as  the  start  date.  Patients  were  identified  as  exposed  to  Orkambi  until  a medications form was completed when Orkambi treatment was not reported, the patient was lost to follow-up, or the patient died. The Orkambi stop date was the first encounter date when exposure was not indicated, the patient was lost to follow-up, or the patient died.

In the analyses, Orkambi exposure was categorized into meaningful groups based on the duration of exposure, such as &lt;1 year, ≥1 to &lt;2 years, and ≥2 years .

## CHMP comment

Limitations coming from the use of a registry as data source and also from only one selected source (US registry, only some sites) should be considered.

Moreover, the US CFFPR as a data source for this study utilizes encounter-based data collection and records the data from each patient visit in the real-world setting; the clinical outcome definitions used in  the  US  CFFPR  and  the  mechanisms  and  guidelines  for  data  collection  were  different  from  those definitions used in Studies 105, 103, and 104.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Statistical Methods

Data source: the US CFFPR tracks the treatments and health of people with CF across the US and is the largest CF patient registry in the geographic regions covered by Study 105. Information is collected on  patients  who  receive  care  at  more  than  110  CFF-accredited  care  centers  and  who  agree  to participate in the registry. The US CFFPR includes approximately 29,000 patients with CF, representing 81% to 84% of all people with CF in the country.

Data from the US CFFPR were used for all study analyses.

Data management was maintained at the US CFFPR according to their internal processes. Only final analysis  tables  (i.e.,  no  patient-level  data  from  the  registries)  were  provided  to  the  marketing authorization holder

The CF centers were responsible for the quality of the US CFFPR data. The annual grants application signed by all center directors had a clause that stated that the registry data provided by the center were accurate to the best of the center director's knowledge.

Variables: all study variables were derived from existing data in the US CFFPR that were collected in prespecified  data  collection  forms.  Investigators  (physicians  with  expertise  in  CF)  from  certified  CF centers completed the forms according to the data guidelines and indicated the specified diagnoses for patients. The US CFFPR's own data entry guideline was used.

The US CFFPR independently determined the data to be collected within the US CFFPR.

Statistical  methods: US  CFFPR  data  were  analyzed  for  3  years.  Separate  annual  analyses  were performed  based  on  the  2016,  2017,  and  2018  data.  All  analyses  were  descriptive  and  based  on observed trends over time.

Continuous variables were summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics in each of the analysis years: (1) number of patients (n); (2) mean; (3) SD; (4) SE; (5) median; (6) minimum value; (7) maximum value; and (8) 95% CI, as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized using the number and percentage of patients and the 95% CI.

For  event-based  categorical  endpoints  (e.g.,  hospitalizations  and  PEx),  the  number  of  events  and annual risks with 95% CI were calculated for each of the 3 analysis years. Percentages were presented to 1 decimal place, unless otherwise specified.

For each analysis year, only patients who continued to be treated with Orkambi were included, and the number and percentage  of  patients  who  did  not  have  any  record  of  Orkambi  use  within  the  whole calendar year was tabulated.

A stratified analysis of both continuous and categorical endpoints could be carried out as appropriate on important patient characteristics (e.g., ppFEV1 by patient characteristics [age, gender]).

No formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed. No imputation of missing data was conducted in  the  course  of  statistical  analyses;  however,  sensitivity  analyses  could  be  performed  if  deemed necessary and applicable.

Summary statistics for the overall population and for the following subgroups was tabulated:

- Age at the start of Analysis Year 1 (&lt;18 years, ≥18 years)
- Sex (male, female)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- ppFEV1 at the start of Analysis Year 1 (&lt;70, ≥70)

Safety: all safety endpoint analyses were performed in the overall study population. The number and percentage of  patients  with  i)  LFT  elevations  (ALT,  AST,  BILI)  relative  to  the  upper  limit  of  normal (ULN), ii)  a record of hypertension, death (overall and by type of death), or organ transplantation (overall and by organ) were tabulated for each analysis year.

Ad hoc analyses were done as summarized below:

- BMI was stratified by age in 2016 (&lt;20 and ≥20 years of age). Weight -for-age z -scores for patients &lt;20 years of age in 2016 were also calculated;
-  Sensitivity  analyses  of  all  endpoints  in  patients  with  evidence  of  Orkambi  exposure  in  all  3  study years were performed.

## CHMP comment

Variables  derived  from  existing  data  in  the  US  CFFPR  that  were  collected  in  pre-specified  data collection  forms.  The  US  CFFPR's  own  data  entry  guideline was  followed,  therefore  a  standardized procedure  was  in  place  for  data  collection.  Statistical  analyses  were  descriptive  and  not  formal hypotheses were conducted.

With  regard  to  the  paediatric  subset,  the  MAH  conducted  some  subgroup  or  ad  hoc  analyses.  It  is highlighted that the focus of this procedure is the paediatric setting from 12 years and older and that these data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure REC 10.1, recommendation to submit a final clinical study report of Study VX16-809-120.

## CHMP comment

This  study  planned  to  include  all  US  Study  105  Part  A  participants  homozygous  for  F508del,  who completed treatment with LUM/IVA, were enrolled in the US CFFPR, and provided consent for their US CFFPR data to be evaluated. However, only a subset of US sites consented to participate in Study 120.

Out of 485 subjects from US who completed study 105, roughly half were included in Study 120 (256 in  the  2016;  239  in  the  2017;  202  in  the  2018).  Reasons  for  exclusion  were  patients  from  the  US Clinical  sites  who  did  not  participate  in  Study  120  (n=129),  patients  who  did  not  consent  (n=67), patients with no evidence of Orkambi treatment in 2016 in US CFFPR (N=31).

From the available data, it seems that Orkambi discontinuation (desumed from the number of patients with no evidence of Orkambi treatment in US CFFPR) ranged between 5% and 14% per year (31/287, 11% in 2016; 13/256, 5% in 2017; 34/239, 14% in 2018). However, no information is available on the  reasons  for  discontinuation,  and  no  follow  up  data  after  Orkambi  discontinuation  have  been provided.  Thus,  patients  included  in  study  120  represent  only  a  selected  proportion  of  the  patient population enrolled in study 105, and the external validity of study results appears questionable and should be further discussed by the MAH (OC).

Data are n (%) or mean (SD). CFFPR=Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry. ppFEV;=percent predicted FEV. *Data reported are baseline from TRAFFIC or TRANSPORT for patients who rolled over into PROGRESS. +Baseline was the later of two stable visits in 2012 (ie, no evidence of a care episode and no material change in ppFEV, or change in any routine drug treatment). +Baselinevisit was the day of lumacaftor/ivacaftor start. SWang-Hankinson equations were used to calculate ppFEV, in PROGRESS; Global Lungs Initiative equations were used to calculate ppFEV, in the rate of change analysis.

## CHMP comment

The two groups (Orkambi exposure in 2016 and Orkambi exposure across 3 years) appear balanced in terms of lung function (ppFEV1) and CF medication use at baseline.

## CHMP comment

Mean ppFEV1 was maintained from 2016 through 2018 in the Orkambi overall cohort. Stratification by sex or lung function by ppFEV1 categories showed consistent results, apart from patients with ppFEV1 start of 2016 ≥70 who underwent a mean decline of 1 percentage point per year (1.4 in 2017 an d 0.9 in 2018).

Importantly, an ad hoc analysis on stratification by age at start (≥ or &lt; 18 years) in Orkambi treated patients  with  3-years  exposure  showed,  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  &lt;18  years,  a  mean  decrease of -2.1 percentage point in the first year and of -0.66 in the second year. The mean decrease observed in subjects ≥18 years was -1.07 in the first year of observation, followed by a mean increase of 1.45 in the second year. It is noted that the baseline mean value of ppFEV1 was slightly higher in patients &lt;18 years of age as compared to those ≥ 18 years.

The sensitivity analysis that included only subjects with continuous Orkambi exposure from 2016 to 2018, showed:

- -in the overall population a mean decrease in ppFEV1 of -1.15 percentage point in the first year and of -0.79 in the second year.
- in the subgroup of patients &lt;18 years a mean decrease in ppFEV1 of -1.96 percentage point in the first year and of1.47 in the second year. The mean decrease observed in subjects ≥18 years was -0.93 in the first year of observation and -0.59 in the second year.

Across  presented  analyses,  the  observed  decline  in  predicted  ppFEV1  (measured  as  decrease  in percentage  point)  over  3  years  exposure  was  consistently  higher  in  the  younger  (&lt;18  years)  age category as compared to the older one (≥18 years).

The observed decreases seem slightly lower than the mean -2.29 percentage point per year reported in US registry patients homozygous for F508del mutation and untreated with CFTR modulator therapy used as controls in the matched analysis of the PROGRESS Study  (Konstan M, McKone E, Moss R, Marigowda G, Tian S, Waltz D, et al). Evidence for reduced rate of lung function decline and sustained benefit  with  combination  lumacaftor  and  ivacaftor  therapy  in  patients  with  CF  homozygous  for  the F508del-CFTR mutation. Lancet Respir Med. 2017; 16: S2213-600). However, in these published data the results in the subgroup of controls &lt;18 years of age have not been presented separately.

When comparing baseline characteristics of the 455 US patients who were included in the matched registry  cohort  (  Konstan  et  al,  2017)  with  patients  enrolled  in  Study  120,  some  differences  are observed: ≥12 -&lt;18 years: US PROGRESS completers 25.7% vs Study 120 18.8%; ppFEV1 mean (SD) at baseline: 59.8 (13.8) vs 66.3 (16.6) percentage points.

## CHMP comment

BMI for age-z score and mean BMI were stable with a slight trend to increase in the overall Orkambi coh ort as well as in the population stratified by age (≥ or &lt; 20 years). However, it is not clear why the cut-off of 20 years was used.

## CHMP comment

In  Study  120,  PEx  was  defined  by  evidence  of  a  CF  care  episode  with  PEx  as  the  reason.  The proportion of patients who had ≥ 1 PEx in the overall Orkambi cohort of patients slightly increased over the 3 -year of exposure (from  47.7  in 2016 to 49.5 in 2018).

Mean number per patient over 3 years exposure slightly reduced (from 0.93 in 2016 to 0.88 in 2018). It is highlighted that no analysis of PEx (both as proportion of patients with at least one PEx and PEx annualized  event  rate)  is  provided  in  paediatric  patients  a ged  ≥12  years.  The  MAH  should  provide these analyses.

In Study 105, PEx was defined as a new or change in antibiotic therapy (IV, inhaled, or oral) for any 4 or more of the  followingsigns/symptoms: Change in sputum; New or increased hemoptysis; Increased cough;  Increased  dyspnea;  Malaise,  fatigue,  or  lethargy;  Temperature  above  38°C  (equivalent  to approximately 100.4°F); Anorexia or weight loss; Sinus pain or tenderness; Change in sinus discharge; Change  in  physical  examination  (PE)  of  the  chest;  Decrease  in  pulmonary  function  by  10%;  and Radiographic changes indicative of pulmonary infection. This definition was based on the definition of a PEx used in previous clinical studies including IVA clinical studies.

The PEx rate (mean number of PEx per patient: 0.93, 0.85, 0.88 respectively in 2016, 2017 and 2018) in Study 120 was higher compared to Study 105 (number of events per patient year: 0.65), however due to the different definitions used in the two studies, no definitive conclusion may be drawn.

Unfortunately,  the  comparison  of  the  rate  of  change  in  annualized  PExs  between  Orkambi  treated patients and matched controls was not among the outcome measures in the publication by Konstan and co-workers (Supplementary material to Konstan et al. Lancet Respir Med 2016; published online Dec 20).

In  Study  120  the  US  registry  definition  was  used,  thus  a  comparison  with  the  untreated  matched registry cohort published by Konstan and co-workers should be provided at least for the 3 years followup.

Hospitalizations: defined  if  there  was  evidence  of  a  hospitalization  that  occurred  for  any  reason. Reasons  for  hospitalization  were  evaluated  as  recorded  in  the  US  CFFPR  database  (e.g.,  PEx, pulmonary complication, gastrointestinal complication, transplant-related, sinus infection, nontransplant surgery, and other).

## CHMP comment

The proportion of patients who had ≥ 1 hospitalization in the overall Orkambi cohort increased over the 3 -year of exposure (from 41% in 2016 to 46% in 2018).

The annualized hospitalization rate over 3 year exposure slightly increased (from 0.79 in 2016 to 0.82 in  2018).  It  is  highlighted  that  no  analyses  on  hospitalization  are  provided  (both  as  proportion  of patients who had ≥1hospitalization and as hospitalization rate) in paediatric patients aged ≥12 years. The main reason of hospitalization was PEx.

## Safety results

Liver function tests (LFTs): alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin (BILI) as recorded in the registry.

## CHMP comment

Safety data coming from this longer follow-up in the observational study seem to confirm the safety profile described in study 105.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

At  the  time  of  the  initial  Orkambi  approval  in  the  EU,  the  CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  explore  the possibility of a longer follow-up (i.e. 5 years) of study population enrolled in the phase 3 study (study 105) submitted in support of the indication in patients 12 years and older. Because the majority of subjects had completed Study 105 at the time of this request, the MAH determined that extending this study  for  an  additional  3  years  was  not  feasible  and  explored  the  feasibility  of  identifying  and evaluating Study 105 participants via existing national CF patient registries in US and EU.

Based on further assessment of feasibility, evaluated EU registries were considered not suitable for the purposes  of  the  study  due  to  various  reasons,  including  low  national  coverage  (e.g.,  Spain,  50), significant  data  availability  lags  and/or  data  quality  issues  (e.g.,  Italy;  as  of  2017,  the  most  recent data  available  are  from  2014),  or  very  small  Study  105  patient  pool  (e.g.,  UK,  France,  Germany, Sweden, Austria,  and  Denmark).  Because  a  significant  proportion  of  subjects  who  completed  Study 105 Part A were from the US (N = 485; 53%), the MAH planned to conduct Study 120, following only US subjects from Study 105 Part A (patients homozygous for F508del coming from parent studies 103 and 104) who were also enrolled in the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) for 3 years after the completion of Study 105. Given the limitations of Study 105, the study was considered by the MAH to be hypotheses-generating rather than hypothesis-testing.

The protocol for the observational study 120 has been considered acceptable by CHMP in the PostAuthorisation Measure REC 10.1, dated 15 March 2018. The concern initially raised that the pool of patients ultimately available for analysis could be small and that the number of analysable patients could not be sufficient to provide a clear and relevant response to the CHMP request, was not pursued as it was considered acceptable to supplement the data from Study 120 with that from PASS study 108, to fulfil the CHMP request on additional data on safety and efficacy. Similarly, the initial request to discuss the possibility of including a matched control group from the registry was not pursued, as the much larger PASS study 108 has a large Orkambi treated and control arm that comprise the safety cohort from the US registry.

With this application, the MAH is submitting the final results of Study 120. Out of 485 subjects from US who completed study 105, only roughly half (256/485, 53%) were included in the Orkambi Cohort Study 120. Thus, patients included in study 120 represent only a selected subgroup (roughly 25%) of the patient population enrolled in study 105 (only from US and only some from US sites who consented to participate).

The number of patients with no evidence of Orkambi treatment in US CFFPR per year ranged between 5% and 14% per year during the  3  years  of  Study  120  registry  follow-up  (31/287,  11%  in  2016; 13/256, 5% in 2017; 34/239, 14% in 2018). No information is available for these patients as, in the study protocol, the MAH had pre-specified that only if an attrition greater than 20% was observed, available  patient  characteristics  would  have  been  examined  in  order  to  understand  if  there  were systematic differences related to exposure between individuals who remained in the study and those who were lost to follow-up.

When comparing baseline characteristics of the 455/485 US patients included in Study 105, who were included in the published analysis with the matched registry cohort (Konstan et al, 2017), these appear to partially differ from patients enrolled in Study 120 (% of subjects ≥12 -&lt;18 years: 25.7% vs 18.8%; mean ppFEV1 at baseline: 59.8  vs 66.3 percentage points, respectively in US study 105 completers compared with subjects participating in Study 120).

The post-approval commitment requested by the CHMP was to provide data to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Orkambi treatment over a period of 5 years, whereas the provided follow up is of only 3 years. For this reason the MAH was requested to complement results on the effectiveness and safety

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

endpoints evaluated in Study 120 (ppFEV1, BMI and weight, pulmonary exacerbation, liver function tests, hypertension, organ transplantation) with results on the same endpoints obtained during the 2 years  of  Study  105,  in  order  to  have  an  overall  period  of  observation  of  5  years.  The  MAH  was requested  to  provide  these  results  both  in  the  overall  Study  120  population  and  separately  in  the subgroups &lt;18 years of age and ≥18 years of age.

Moreover,  given  that  part  of  the  256  US  subjects  included  in  Study  120  are  included  also  in  the published analysis of the matched registry cohort the MAH was requested to provide the 5 year follow up of these patients in comparison with their matched controls, according to the same methodology followed in the publication by Konstan et al. 2017. Limitedly to a 3 year follow up, the MAH was also been  requested  to  provide  the  rate  of  change  in  annualized  Pex  in  Orkambi  treated  patients  and matched registry controls (overall and by age, using the 18 yrs cut-off), given that both Study 120 and the US registry used the same definition of Pex. Following the request of supplementary information, the MAH stated that the request for matched control analyses using the same methodology followed in Konstan et al. are beyond the scope of the approved protocol and would not be feasible because a sufficient  pool  of  CFTR  modulator  naïve  F/F  patients  cannot  be  identified  during  this  period  to appropriately match to study participants in Study 120. Given that in the Final Assessment Report for the Post-Authorisation Measure REC 10.1, dated 15 March 2018, the safety data generated from the larger PASS study 108 with an Orkambi treated and a control arm, was considered sufficient to fill in the lacunae in information from the absence of a control group in study 120, the initial request of a matched controlled analysis was not pursued further.

The  required  results  have  been  provided  by  the  MAH  for  both  overall  Study  120  population  and separately  in  adult  and  paediatric  subgroups,  although  in  the  paediatric  setting  results  should  be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size (n = 48).

Similarly  to  what  observed  in  Study  105,  a  trend  towards  a  numerical  decaying  of  effect  on  lung function (ppFEV1) with longer treatment duration was observed in Orkambi treated subjects in Study 120; however the indirect comparison with published cohorts of US registry patients homozygous for F508del mutation untreated with CFTR modulator therapy (Konstan et al, 2017; Wegener et al, 2018), seem to indicate a numerically slower annual rate of ppFEV1 decline in Orkambi treated subjects.

In Study 120, mean BMI was stable in the overall Orkambi cohort as well as in the subgroups ≥ or &lt; 18 years.  For the paediatric subgroup in Study 105, BMI-for-age z-scores were negative but generally improved throughout Study 105. In Study 120, in the subgroup &lt;18 years, there was numerically a slight decrease of BMI for age Z scores during Study 120, although with values close to zero.

In the subgroup of Study 120 paediatric subjects (12-&lt;18 years) the PEx rate seems higher compared to Study 105, however due to the different definitions used in the two studies, no conclusion may be drawn. The proportion of patients who had ≥ 1 hospitalization in the Study 120 overall Orkambi cohort slightly increased over the 3 -year of exposure (from 41%  in 2016 to 46% in 2018), as well as the annualized hospitalization rate (from 0.79 in 2016 to 0.82 in 2018), with PEx being the main reason of hospitalization (&gt;90%).

Overall, the trends observed in safety endpoints in Study 120 were consistent with the safety profile described in study 105.

Given that patients included in study 120 represent only a selected subgroup (roughly 25%) of the patient population enrolled in study 105 (only from US and only some from US sites who consented to participate), the comparison between Study 120 and Study 105 results is subject to limitations. It is acknowledged that due to the differences in data collection and endpoint definitions, it may not be appropriate to combine the clinical data from Study 105 and the registry-based data from Study 120 or directly compare the reported values for each endpoint. For these reasons, even though the MAH has

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

not  provided  the  results  of  the  two  years  of  treatment  in  Study  105  separately  for  the  subset  of patients enrolled in Study 120, the issue was not further pursued.

In  the  3rd  interim  analysis  from  the  ongoing  PASS  (Study  108,  a  5-year  long-term  observational study),  results  from  the  comparative  safety  analysis  from  the  US  CFFPR  generally  favoured  the Orkambi  Safety  Cohort  over  the  Comparator  Safety  Cohort.  The  4th  interim  analysis  report  of  the ongoing PASS Study (expected in December 2020) will provide additional data on the long-term effects of Orkambi, including subgroups of adult and paediatric patients.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

The  MAH  provided  the  results  on  the  effectiveness  and  safety  endpoints  evaluated  in  Study  120. However, interpretation of Study 120 results are hampered by the limited number of patients enrolled (only a roughly 25% of the patient population enrolled in study 105 were enrolled in Study 120) and the comparison between data from Study 120 (clinical study) and Study 105 (registry-based data) is subject to limitations, also due to differences in data collection and endpoint definitions. Moreover, the paediatric  subgroup  results  for  Study  120  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  because  of  the  small sample size (n = 48).

Although  a  trend  towards  a  numerical  decaying  of  effect  on  lung  function  (ppFEV1)  with  longer treatment duration was observed in Orkambi treated subjects in Study 120, the indirect comparison with published cohorts of US registry patients homozygous for F508del mutation untreated with CFTR modulator therapy provides some reassurance  indicating a slower annual rate of ppFEV1 decline.

Overall trends observed in the effectiveness and safety endpoints in Study 120 were consistent with those in Study 105.

The 4th interim analysis report of the ongoing PASS Study (expected in December 2020) will provide additional  data  on  the  long-term  effects  of  Orkambi,  including  subgroups  of  adult  and  paediatric patients.

## Fulfilled:

No regulatory action required.

## 4. Additional clarification requested

Based  on  the  data  submitted,  the  MAH  should  address  the  following  questions  as  part  of  this procedure:

1)  Patients  included  in  study  120  represent  only  a  selected  proportion  of  the  patient  population enrolled in study 105, and the external validity of study results appears questionable and should be further discussed by the MAH.

2)  The  post-approval  commitment  requested  by  the  CHMP  was  to  provide  data  to  evaluate  of  the safety and effectiveness of Orkambi treatment over a period of 5 years, whereas the provided follow up  is  of  only  3  years.  Results  on  the  effectiveness  and  safety  endpoints  evaluated  in  Study  120 (ppFEV1, BMI  and weight, pulmonary  exacerbation, liver function tests, hypertension, organ transplantation) should be complemented with results on the same endpoints obtained during the 2 years of Study 105, in order to have an overall period of observation of 5 years. The MAH is requested to provide these results both in the overall Study 120 population and separately in the subgroups &lt;18 years of age and ≥18 years of age.

3) Given that part of the 256 US subjects included in Study 120 are included also in the published analysis  of  the  matched  registry  cohort  (  Konstan  et  al,  Lancet  Resp  Med  2017),  the  MAH  should provide the 5 year follow up of these patients in comparison with their matched controls, according to the same methodology followed in the publication by Konstan et al. 2017. Limitedly to a 3 year follow up, the MAH should also provide the rate of change in annualized PEx in Orkambi treated patients and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

matched registry controls (overall and by age, using the 18 yrs cut-off), given that both Study 120 and the US registry used the same definition of PEx.

## MAH responses to the 1 st  Request for supplementary information

## Question 1

Patients included in study 120 represent only a selected proportion of the patient population enrolled in study  105,  and  the  external  validity  of  study  results  appears  questionable  and  should  be  further discussed by the MAH.

## MAH's Response

Vertex acknowledges that the Study 120 population includes only the subset of Study VX12-809-105 (Study 105) participants enrolled in the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) who provided consent. The Study 120 protocol was designed with input from the CHMP; the final protocol was  reviewed  and  endorsed  by  the  CHMP  (see  Final  Assessment  Report  for  the  Post-Authorisation Measure REC 10.1, dated 15 March 2018 and hereafter referred to as 'Assessment Report REC 10.1'). During the assessment of the protocol, the CHMP acknowledged that only a subset of subjects from Study 105 would enroll in Study 120, that Study 120 would be descriptive only, and that data from the large postauthorization safety study (PASS) VX14-809-108 (Study 108) could be used to supplement Study 120 data and would be acceptable to fulfill the CHMP's request fo r additional safety and efficacy data.

Vertex believes that the Rapporteur's concerns regarding the external validity of results of this study are mitigated by the following:

· The US registry-based approach identified and evaluated a significant proportion of the subjects in the US, which was the country with the largest subpopulation of Study 105 subjects.

· The phenotype and clinical course of cystic fibrosis (CF) in the F508del homozygous (F/F) population does  not  substantially  differ  by  geographic  region;  therefore,  data  from  the  US  patient  population captured by the US CFFPR are appropriate for assessing long-term safety and efficacy, and trends can be extrapolated for all global regions.

• The trends observed in Study 120 are consistent with the trends observed in Study 105.

· The results from Study 120 are consistent with the results from other studies evaluating the longterm effects of Orkambi therapy, including the ongoing 5-year PASS (Study 108), a much larger realworld  comparator-controlled  study.  In  the  3rd  interim  analysis  report  for  the  PASS  (Study  108) submitted 26 November 2019, key clinical outcomes of 4,628 F/F patients in the Orkambi® Cohort are compared  to  5,666  patients  heterozygous  for  F508del  in  the  Comparator  Cohort,  with  results  that support the current benefit-risk profile of Orkambi.

Based on the above, Vertex concludes that, although the Study 120 population represents a selected proportion of the Study 105 subjects, the consistency of the results with clinical and real-world studies minimizes  concerns  regarding  the  external  validity  of  the  results.  Vertex  is  committed  to  continue evaluating the long-term effects of Orkambi in the ongoing PASS (Study 108); the Study 108 data can be used to supplement Study 120 data, as endorsed by the CHMP in the Assessment Report REC 10.1. Furthermore, additional efficacy data will be obtained from a post-authorization efficacy study VX18809-128, which was requested by the EMA as part of the approval of procedure EMEA/H/C/003954/X/0034/G  (Vertex  submitted  the  protocol  for  Scientific  Advice  in  procedure EMEA/H/SA/1448/6/2019/PED/II and intends to submit the protocol to the EMA in Q2 2020).

## Assessment of the MAH's Response

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  MAH  emphasizes  that  the  final  protocol  was  reviewed  and  endorsed  by  the  CHMP  (see  Final Assessment Report for the Post-Authorisation Measure REC 10.1, dated 15 March 2018). During the assessment of the protocol, the CHMP acknowledged that only a subset of subjects from Study 105 would enrol in Study 120, that Study 120 would be descriptive only, and that data from the large post authorization safety study (PASS) VX14-809-108 (Study 108) could be used to supplement Study 120 data and would be acceptable to fulfill the CHMP's request for additional safety and efficacy data.

The MAH 's opinion is that, although the Study 120 population represents a selected proportion of the Study 105 subjects, the trends observed in Study 120 are consistent with the trends observed in Study 105 and the results from Study 120 are consistent with the 3rd interim analysis report for the PASS (Study 108) submitted 26 November 2019; in the MAH's opinion consistency of the results with clinical and real-world studies minimizes concerns regarding the external validity of the results.

The MAH will continue evaluating the long-term effects of Orkambi in the ongoing PASS (Study 108).

Furthermore,  the  MAH  emphasizes  that  additional  efficacy  data  will  be  obtained  from  a  postauthorization efficacy study VX18-809-128, for patients 2- to 5-years-old at initiation of Orkambi.

It is acknowledged that in the Final Assessment Report for the Post-Authorisation Measure REC 10.1, dated  15  March  2018,  the  concern  initially  raised  that  the  pool  of  patients  ultimately  available  for analysis could be small and that the number of analysable patients could not be sufficient to provide a clear and relevant response to the CHMP request, was not pursued as it was considered acceptable to supplement the data from Study 120 with that from PASS study 108, to fulfil the CHMP request on additional data on safety and efficacy.

Patients included in study 120 represent only a selected subgroup of the patient population enrolled in study 105 (only from US and only some from US sites who consented to participate).

The MAH's opinion that, alth ough the Study 120 population represents a selected proportion of the Study 105 subjects, the trends observed in Study 120 are consistent with the trends observed in Study 105 is not agreed. As further discussed in the assessment of the response to question 2, given that only 53% of subjects who completed study 105 were from US, and given that  out of 485 subjects from US who completed study 105, only roughly half were included in Study 120 (256 in the 2016; 239 in the 2017; 202 in the 2018), it is not considered appropriate to compare the overall 2 year results of Study 105 with the 3 year follow up in Study 120. Please refer to assessment of Question 2 for further aspects on this issue.

## Question 2

The post-approval commitment requested by the CHMP was to provide data to evaluate of the safety and effectiveness of Orkambi treatment over a period of 5 years, whereas the provided follow up is of only 3 years. Results on the effectiveness and safety endpoints evaluated in Study 120 (ppFEV1, BMI and weight, pulmonary exacerbation, liver function tests, hypertension, organ transplantation) should be complemented with results on the same endpoints obtained during the 2 years of Study 105, in order  to  have  an  overall  period  of  observation  of  5  years.  The  MAH  is  requested  to  provide  these results both in the overall Study 120 population and separately in the subgroups &lt;18 years of age and ≥18 years of age.

## MAH's Response

Vertex clarifies that, according to the approved protocol, Study 120 follows subjects of Study 105 for an additional 3 years following the conclusion of Study 105. While the focus of the results in Study 120 is on the most recent 3-year follow-up period, these subjects were exposed to Orkambi for a total of 5 years or longer because they initiated treatment in clinical Study 105 or one of the 2 feeder studies, Study  VX12-809-103  or  Study  VX12-809-104.  During  the  assessment  of  the  protocol  (Assessment

Report  REC  10.1),  the  CHMP  confirmed  that  it  would  be  acceptable  for  trends  over  5  years  to  be described in the final clinical study report for Study 120, including a discussion of relevant data from the previously completed 2-year Study 105 and the summary of results of the 3-year follow-up after Study 105 obtained via the US CFFPR. This information was provided in the Study 120 CSR/Sections 8.2 and 13.1.

Due to the important differences in the data collection and definitions of the clinical outcomes during the periods of participation in Study 105 and subsequent real-world registry-based Study 120, it is not appropriate  to  combine  the  datasets  or  to  perform  a  direct  comparison  of  outcomes  between  the periods (e.g., to compare the clinical study and the real-world registry based follow-up period). The US CFFPR  data  from  Study  120  are  observational  in  nature,  collected  over  the  course  of  routine  care without  scheduled  visit  intervals  or  standardized  assessments.  In  contrast,  Study  105  data  were collected under the rigorous standards for clinical study data collection, including predefined intervals between  assessments,  standardized  measurements  and  procedures,  and  standardized  definitions  of clinical  outcomes/endpoints.  The  differences  in  clinical  outcome  definition  are  exemplified  by  the definitions  for  pulmonary  exacerbation  (PEx).  The  US  CFFPR  defines  PEx  as  an  episode  requiring intravenous antibiotic use at home or in the hospital. However, PEx in Study 105 was strictly defined by criteria standardized across Vertex CF clinical studies a , where most of these criteria are based upon assessments  that  are  not  captured  in  registry  data  (e.g.,  change  in  sputum  and  change  in  sinus discharge).

While the Study 120 data cannot be combined with Study 105 data due to these critical differences in data collection, the trends observed for the clinical outcomes during the 3-year follow-up in Study 120 are nonetheless consistent with those observed from the 2-year follow-up in Study 105. Specifically, the  effectiveness  outcomes  in  subjects  in  Study  120  demonstrated  overall  stable  trends  in  percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1), body mass index (BMI) values, annual risk of  PEx,  annualized  PEx  rate,  and  annualized  rate  of  hospitalizations,  which  was  consistent  with  the long-term maintenance of the treatment effect demonstrated in Study 105 for the relevant endpoints. In addition, no new safety concerns or trends, including elevated alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase values, were identified in Study 120, and low rates of death and lung transplantation were observed.

a  In Study 105, PEx was defined as a new, or change in, antibiotic therapy (intravenous, inhaled, or oral) for any 4 or more of the following signs/symptoms: change in sputum; new or increased hemoptysis; increased cough; increased dyspnea; malaise, fatigue, or lethargy; temperature above 38°C (equivalent to approximately 100.4°F); anorexia or weight loss; sinus pain or tenderness; change in sinus discharge; change in physical examination of the chest; decrease in pulmonary function by 10%; and radiographic changes indicative of pulmonary infection.

## Assessment of the MAH's Response

The  MAH  states  that  due  to  the  important  differences  in  the  data  collection  and  definitions  of  the clinical outcomes during the periods of participation in Study 105 (data collected under the rigorous standards  for  clinical  study  data  collection)  and  subsequent  real-world  registry-based  Study  120 (observational  data,  collected  over  the  course  of  routine  care  without  scheduled  visit  intervals  or standardized  assessments),  it  is  not  appropriate  to  combine  the  datasets  or  to  perform  a  direct comparison of outcomes between the periods (e.g., to compare the clinical study and the real-world registry based follow-up period).

Furthermore, the MAH's opinion is that while the Study 120 data cannot be combined with Stu dy 105 data due to these critical differences in data collection, the trends observed for the clinical outcomes during the 3-year follow-up in Study 120 are nonetheless consistent with those observed from the 2year follow-up in Study 105. Specifically, the MAH states that the effectiveness outcomes in subjects in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study  120  demonstrated  overall  stable  trends  in  percent  predicted  forced  expiratory  volume  in  1 second  (ppFEV1),  body  mass  index  (BMI)  values,  annual  risk  of  PEx,  annualized  PEx  rate,  and annualized  rate  of  hospitalizations,  which  was  consistent  with  the  long-term  maintenance  of  the treatment  effect  demonstrated  in  Study  105  for  the  relevant  endpoints.  In  addition,  no  new  safety concerns were identified in Study 120.

During  the  assessment  of  the  protocol  (Assessment  Report  REC  10.1),  the  MAH  was  requested  to confirm that trends over 5 years will be described i.e. the relevant data from the two-year study 105 will also be included in the description of long term safety and efficacy and the MAH confirmed that trends  over  5  years  will  be  described  in  the  final  clinical  study  report  for  Study  120,  including  a discussion of relevant data from the previously completed 2-year Study 105.

In Study 105, although the efficacy seemed to be sustained during the initial 24 weeks, a trend of decaying beyond Week 24 was observed: for subjects who received active treatment in both Study 103/104  and  Study  105,  the  improvements  in  ppFEV1  from  previous  study  baseline  during  Study 103/104  were  generally  sustained  in  Study  105  up  to  Extension  Week  36  for  L600qd/I  group  and Extension Week 24 for L400q12h/I group.  The improvement in ppFEV1 decreased over time in both groups  with  small/no  improvement  in  ppFEV1  at  Extension  Week  96.  The  least  square  (LS)  mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 for the L400q12h/I group (the authorized dose for this age group) was 1.6 percentage points (P = 0.0012) at Week 60; at Week 72, the L400q12h/I group result was numerically above baseline but lacked within-treatment statistical significance (P = 0.2806).

The  differences  in  the  data  collection  and  definitions  of  the  clinical  outcomes  during  the  periods  of participation in Study 105 (clinical study data) and in Study 120 (real-world registry-based data) are known  limitations  of  the  protocol  proposed  by  the  MAH  in  order  to  fulfil  the  post-authorization commitment.  Nevertheless,  in  the  Final  Assessment  Report  REC  10.1,  the  MAH  has  confirmed  that trends  over  5  years  will  be  described  in  the  final  clinical  study  report  for  Study  120,  including  a discussion of relevant data from the previously completed 2-year Study 105.

In Study 105, although the efficacy seemed to be sustained during the initial 24 weeks, a trend of decaying beyond Week 24 was observed with small/no improvement in ppFEV1 at Extension Week 96. At Week 72, the L400q12h/I group result was numerically above baseline but lacked within-treatment statistical significance (P = 0.2806) (see CHMP AR EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0017). Given that only 53% of subjects who completed study 105 were from US, and given that  out of 485 subjects from US who completed study 105, only roughly half were included in Study 120 (256 in the 2016; 239 in the 2017; 202 in the 2018), it is not considered appropriate to compare the overall 2 year results of Study 105 with the 3 year follow up in Study 120. The issue is not resolved.

The  request  to  provide  results  on  the  effectiveness  and  safety  endpoints  evaluated  in  Study  120 (ppFEV1, BMI  and weight, pulmonary  exacerbation, liver function tests, hypertension, organ transplantation)  complemented  with  results  on  the  same  endpoints  obtained  during  the  2  years  of Study 105, in order to have an overall period of observation of 5 years is reiterated. Also, the request to provide these results both in the overall population and separately in the subgroups &lt;18 years of age and ≥18 years of age is reiterated.

## Question 3

Given  that  part  of  the  256  US  subjects  included  in  Study  120  are  included  also  in  the  published analysis  of  the  matched  registry  cohort  (  Konstan  et  al,  Lancet  Resp  Med  2017),  the  MAH  should provide the 5 year follow up of these patients in comparison with their matched controls, according to the same methodology followed in the publication by Konstan et al. 2017. Limitedly to a 3 year follow up, the MAH should also provide the rate of change in annualized PEx in Orkambi treated patients and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

matched registry controls (overall and by age, using the 18 yrs cut-off), given that both Study 120 and the US registry used the same definition of PEx.

## MAH's response

In accordance with the Assessment Report REC 10.1, Study 120 was designed as a single-arm study without a comparator group. Given the limitations of the design elements for Study 120, data from the ongoing PASS (Study 108) is provided as a supplement to the Study 120 analyses to provide additional data in the assessment of long-term outcomes of Orkambi. This approach is also in accordance with the Assessment Report REC 10.1.

Vertex acknowledges the additional request for matched control analyses using the same methodology followed in Konstan et al.1 but would like to clarify that such analyses are beyond the scope of the approved protocol and would not be feasible due to the following:

·  The  matched  control  analyses  described  in  Konstan  et  al.  were  performed  before  approval  and commercialization of Orkambi in the US, thus the authors were able to evaluate a large pool of F/F patients who were naïve to CFTR modulators, specifically Orkambi.

· Study 120 focuses on the 3-year period predominantly following approval and commercialization of Orkambi,  and,  subsequently,  Symdeko®  in  the  US  (2016  through  2018);  thus,  a  sufficient  pool  of CFTR modulator naïve F/F patients cannot be identified during this period to appropriately match to study participants in Study 120.

Although additional matched control analyses would not be possible, the patterns observed in Study 120 are favorable in the context of natural history of these outcomes among patients untreated with CFTR modulators. Specifically, in Konstan et al., 1  the rate of lung function decline among US registry F/F patients who were untreated with CFTR modulator therapy was 2.29 percentage points per year. In Study 120, lung function remained relatively stable over the course of the 3-year follow-up. Similarly, in  a  real-world  registry-based  study  of  disease  progression  among  patients  treated  with  ivacaftor (Kalydeco Long-term Safety Study), 2  a comparator cohort of patients untreated with CFTR modulators had an increasing annual proportion of patients with ≥ 1 PEx and increasing annualized PEx event rate over time. In Study 120, both the annual proportion of patients with ≥ 1 PEx and annualized PEx event rate were relatively stable over the course of the 3 years following completion of Study 105.

In summary, single cohort data for Study 120 and comparative cohort data from the ongoing longterm PASS (Study 108) are complementary and sufficient to evaluate the long-term effects of Orkambi therapy under the real-world conditions of use and are in accordance with the Assessment Report REC 10.1. In addition, the trends in efficacy outcomes in Study 120 remain favorable when compared to other comparator cohort data from patients untreated with CFTR modulators in previously published studies. 1, 2

## Assessment of the MAH's Response

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH states that the request for matched control analyses using the same methodology followed in Konstan et al. are beyond the scope of the approved protocol and would not be feasible because a sufficient  pool  of  CFTR  modulator  naïve  F/F  patients  cannot  be  identified  during  this  period  to appropriately match to study participants in Study 120.

Furthermore, the MAH states that the patterns observed in Study 120 are favourable in the context of natural  history  of  these  outcomes  among  patients  untreated  with  CFTR  modulators  (Konstan  et  al, 2017; Volkova et al 2020).

Even though in the assessors opinion the previously requested matched control analysis would have allowed to better assess changes in efficacy over time, it is acknowledged that the issue of the absence of a matched control group from the registry, initially raised as a concern to the proposed protocol for this study, was not pursued in the Final Assessment Report for the Post-Authorisation Measure REC 10.1, dated 15 March 2018, on the basis of the argumentation that the safety data generated from the larger PASS study 108 with an Orkambi treated and a control arm, was considered sufficient to fill in the lacunae in information from the absence of a control group in study 120.

The issue is not pursued further.

## 2 nd  Request for supplementary information

The  differences  in  the  data  collection  and  definitions  of  the  clinical  outcomes  during  the  periods  of participation in Study 105 (clinical study data) and in Study 120 (real-world registry-based data) are known  limitations  of  the  protocol  proposed  by  the  MAH  in  order  to  fulfil  the  post-authorization commitment. Nevertheless, in the Final Assessment Report REC 10.1, the applicant has confirmed that that trends over 5 years will be described in the final clinical study report for Study 120, including a discussion of relevant data from the previously completed 2-year Study 105.

In Study 105, although the efficacy seemed to be sustained during the initial 24 weeks, a trend of decaying beyond Week 24 was observed with small/no improvement in ppFEV1 at Extension Week 96. At Week 72, the L400q12h/I group result was numerically above baseline but lacked within-treatment statistical significance (P = 0.2806).

Given that only 53% of subjects who completed study 105 were from US, and given that out of 485 subjects from US who completed study 105, only roughly half were included in Study 120 (256 in the 2016; 239 in the 2017; 202 in the 2018), it is not considered appropriate to compare the overall 2 year results of Study 105 with the 3 year follow up in Study 120.

The  request  to  provide  results  on  the  effectiveness  and  safety  endpoints  evaluated  in  Study  120 (ppFEV1, BMI  and weight, pulmonary  exacerbation, liver function tests, hypertension, organ transplantation)  complemented  with  results  on  the  same  endpoints  obtained  during  the  2  years  of Study 105, in order to have an overall period of observation of 5 years is reiterated. Also the request to provide these results both in the overall population and separately in the subgroups &lt;18 years of age and ≥ 18 years of age is reiterated.

## MAH response to 2 nd  Request for supplementary information

## Summary of the MAH's response

As requested, Vertex is providing the results on the effectiveness and safety endpoints evaluated in Study  120,  complemented  with  the  results  on  the  same  endpoints  observed  in  Study  105.  The requested effectiveness and safety endpoints include: percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1), body mass index (BMI) and weight, pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), liver function

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tests  (LFTs),  hypertension,  and  organ  transplantation.  In  addition,  results  are  also  provided  for  the pediatric (12 to &lt;18 years of age) and adult subgroups ( ≥ 18 years of age) for both studies. A complete list  of  the  tables  summarizing  the  pediatric  and  adult  subgroup  data  is  provided  in  Appendix  1  for Study 105 and in Appendix 2 for Study 120.

Overall, the trends observed in the effectiveness and safety endpoints in Study 120 were consistent with  the  long-term  maintenance  of  the  treatment  effect  demonstrated  in  Study  105,  in  the  overall population as well as pediatric and adult subgroups.

It is important to note that due to the critical differences between interventional clinical studies and observational studies, these results should be interpreted with caution. These differences include data collection  methodology, the nature of the collected data, and the endpoint definitions. For example, Study 105 data were collected under the rigorous standards for clinical study data collection, including predefined intervals between assessments, standardized measurements and procedures, and standardized definitions of clinical outcomes/endpoints. In contrast, Study 120 data was observational in  nature, collected over the course of routine care without scheduled visit intervals or standardized assessments.  Differences  in  endpoint  definitions  (e.g.,  PEx)  between  the  studies  are  discussed  in further  detail  below.  Given  these  limitations,  it  is  not  appropriate  to  combine  the  clinical  data  from Study 105 and the registry-based data from Study 120 or directly compare the reported values for each  endpoint.  Instead  of  comparing  specific  values,  directional  consistency  of  outcomes  should  be evaluated. In addition, the pediatric subgroup results for Study 120 should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size (n = 48).

## Demographics and Baseline Characteristics

A summary of the demographics and baseline characteristics of the overall population and pediatric subgroups in Study 105 and Study 120 are summarized in Table 11.

The overall  distribution  of  patients  by  sex  and  race  are  similar  between  the  overall  population  and pediatric subgroups for both Study 105 and Study 120. The baseline age (mean and range) for both the overall population and pediatric subgroups was higher in Study 120 than in Study 105, which was expected  because  the  baseline  year  for  Study  120  was  2016,  approximately  2.5  years  after  the baseline of Study 105 (Study 103/104 baseline). Mean ppFEV1 at baseline for the pediatric subgroup was higher than that of the overall population for both Studies 105 and 120, which was consistent with the expected lung function in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients of this age group.

## Overall Analysis

For  subjects  in  Study  105  who  received  lumacaftor  (LUM)/ivacaftor  (IVA)  in  parent  Study  103/104, improvements in ppFEV1 observed in Study 103/104 were generally sustained during the additional 96 weeks of treatment in Study 105. For subjects who received placebo in Study 103/104, improvements in ppFEV1 upon receiving LUM/IVA in Study 105 were similar to those observed for the LUM/IVA group in Study 103/104 and were generally sustained throughout Study 105. At Study 105 Week 96, ppFEV1 was above baseline for all treatment groups (Study 105 CSR/ Table 14.2.1.1a). Data from Study 120 showed  that  ppFEV1  remained  generally  stable  over  the  subsequent  3  years  for  a  subset  of participating Study 105 subjects (Figure 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Subgroup Analysis

The  ppFEV1  results  for  the  adult  subgroup  in  Study  105  and  Study  120  (US  CFF  [Age ≥ 18])  were consistent with the trends observed for the overall population for each study. The trends in ppFEV1 observed in the adult subgroup over the 2-year Study 105 and over the subsequent 3 years of followup in Study 120 were consistent with those observed in the overall population. The ppFEV1 results for the  pediatric  subgroup  in  Study  105  and  Study  120  (US  CFF  [Age  &lt;18])  were  consistent  with  the trends observed for the overall population for each study. Mean ppFEV1 at baseline for the pediatric subgroup was higher than that of the overall population for both studies, which was consistent with the expected  lung  function  in  CF  patients  of  this  age  group.  In  the  pediatric  subgroup,  ppFEV1 improvements from baseline were observed and generally sustained in Study 105. Over the 3-year follow-up  in  Study  120,  a  numerical  decrease  in  ppFEV1  was  observed,  which  was  not  statistically significant as illustrated by the wide and overlapping standard error bars (Figure 6).

It  is  important  to  interpret  the  results  observed  in  this  small  paediatric  subgroup  in  context  of  the greater  expected  rate  of  lung  function  decline  in  the  absence  of  CFTR  modulator  treatment.  For instance, based on the analysis of US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) registry data, the annualized rate of lung function decline in patients homozygous for F508del and 13 through 17 years of age not treated  with  a  CFTR  modulator  has  been  previously  estimated  at  -2.66  percentage  points  per  year (Wegener et al, J Cyst Fibros. 2018;17(4):503-10). However, in the Study 120 paediatric subgroup, the absolute change in ppFEV1 was smaller at approximately -1.4 percentage points per year, which supports a lower rate of lung function decline.

Furthermore, additional support for a lower rate of lung function decline with Orkambi treatment was observed in the 3rd interim analysis of the ongoing comparator-controlled Orkambi post-authorization safety study (PASS; Study 108 Interim Analysis Report 3 [IA3]), which showed that in the subgroup of patients 12 to &lt;18 years of age at the time of Orkambi initiation who remained on treatment through 2018 (n = 716), lung function change over 4 years (from pre-treatment baseline year 2014 to 2018) was -3.84 percentage points (approximately -1.0 percentage point per year) versus -7.62 percentage points (approximately -1.9 percentage points per year) in the untreated comparator patients (n = 803) (Study 108 IA3/Table 2.1).

Overall, the patterns observed in Study 120 and the PASS are consistent with the previously published rate of lung function decline analysis in Orkambi-treated patients 12 years of age and older (Konstan et  al.).  This  analysis  was  performed  using  propensity  scores  and  matching  a  subset  of  Study  105 subjects (n = 455) with US CFF Patient Registry control patients (n = 1,588) who were not treated with a CFTR modulator. The estimated annualized rate of lung function decline was -1.33 percentage points in the Orkambi-treated group, which was significantly less than the rate in matched controls (-2.29  percentage  points,  probability  [P]&lt;  0.001).  This  represents  a  42%  decrease  in  the  rate  of ppFEV1 decline in LUM/IVA-treated patients compared with matched controls.

## Weight

## Overall Analysis

For subjects in Study 105 who received LUM/IVA in Study 103/104, weight remained above baseline and generally continued to improve at all visits in Study 105. For subjects who received placebo in Study  103/104,  weight  improved  upon  initiating  LUM/IVA  treatment  and  generally  continued  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

improve throughout Study 105. Over the additional 3- year follow-up in Study 120, weight remained stable.

## Subgroup Analysis

Improvements in weight were observed in the adult and pediatric subgroups for both Studies 105 and 120,  similar  to  those  observed  in  the  overall  population.  Specifically,  improvements  in  weight  were seen throughout Study 105. Similar trends of increased weight were observed over the additional 3year follow-up in Study 120.

## BMI

## Overall Analysis

The  trends  observed  in  Study  105  and  Study  120  for  the  overall  population  was  similar  to  those observed for  weight.  BMI  increased  at  treatment  initiation  and  continued  to  improve  in  Study  105. Over the additional 3-year follow-up in Study 120, BMI remained stable.

## Subgroup Analysis

The trends observed for the adult and pediatric subgroups in Study 105 and Study 120 (US CFF [Age ≥ 18]  Table  3.0  and  US  CFF  [Age  &lt;18]  Table  3.0)  were  consistent  with  the  trends  observed  for  the overall population in each study.

## BMI-for-age Z-score

## Overall Analysis

For both Studies 105 and 120, BMI-for-age z-score was analyzed only in subjects/patients &lt;20 years of age. For subjects in Study 105 who received LUM/IVA in Study 103/104, improvements observed in the parent studies were generally sustained in Study 105. For subjects who received placebo in Study 103/104,  BMI-for-age  z-score  improved  upon  initiating  LUM/IVA  through  Week  36,  and  generally stabilized thereafter. Over the additional 3-year follow-up in Study 120, BMI-for-age z-score in patients &lt;20 years of age remained stable.

## Subgroup Analysis

For the pediatric subgroup in Study 105, BMI-for-age z-scores were negative but generally improved throughout Study 105. BMI-for-age z-scores were generally stable in Study 120 with values close to 0 (US CFF [Age &lt;18].

## PEx

It is important to note that the definitions of the PEx-related endpoints for Studies 105 and 120 are different. The US CFFPR defines PEx as an episode requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotic use at home or in the hospital. However, PEx in Study 105 was strictly defined by criteria standardized across Vertex CF clinical studies, where most of these criteria are based upon assessments that are not captured in registry data (e.g., change in sputum and change in sinus discharge).

## Overall Analysis

In Study 105, the annualized event rate of PEx for subjects who received LUM/IVA in Study 103/104 was lower than that for the placebo group in Study 103/104. For subjects who received placebo in Study 103/104, the annualized event rate of PEx  had a similar event rate as was observed by the LUM/IVA group in Study 103/104. Over the additional 3-year follow-up in Study 120, the annualized event rate of PEx was stable over the 3-year study duration.

## Subgroup Analysis

The trends observed for the adult subgroup in Study 105 and Study 120 (US CFF [Age ≥ 18])  were consistent with the trends observed for the overall population in Study 105 and over the additional 3year follow-up in Study 120. For the pediatric subgroup in Study 105, the annualized event rate ranged

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

between 0.56 and 0.75 across the treatment groups. For the pediatric  subgroup  in  Study  120,  the event rates were generally stable over the 3-year study duration, and were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.49, 1.38), 0.92 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.29) and 1.14 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.57) in 2016, 2017, and 2018 respectively (US CFF [Age &lt;18). These results should be interpreted with caution given the small sample size (n = 43 to 48) as well as differences in the PEx definitions between the clinical study and registry data.

## LFTs

## Overall Analysis

In  Study  105,  the  incidence  of  subjects  with  LFT  elevations  (including  alanine  transaminase  [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], and bilirubin) that met threshold criteria was low and similar across all treatment groups. The majority of elevated transaminase events were mild or moderate in severity, non-serious, and did not lead to study drug discontinuation. Over the additional 3-year follow-up in Study 120, the frequency of patients with any ALT, AST, or bilirubin value exceeding the threshold of &gt;3,  &gt;5,  and  &gt;8  ×  upper  limit  of  normal  (ULN)  was  low.  There  were  no  discernible  trends  in  LFTs exceeding the prespecified threshold of ULN over time.

## Subgroup Analysis

The incidence of subjects with LFT elevations in the adult and pediatric subgroups of Study 105, was also low and similar across treatment groups (Ad Hoc Table 4.1.3.4.3.2a). Over the 3-year follow-up in Study 120, the prevalence of patients with any elevated LFTs was low in both subgroups: ≤ 3.3% in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adult  subgroup  (US  CFF  [Age ≥ 18]  Table  8.0)  and  only  1  patient  in  the  pediatric  subgroup  had  an elevated LFT (ALT &gt;5 × ULN; US CFF [Age &lt;18]).

## Hypertension

It  is  important  to  note  that  the  definitions  of  the  hypertension  events  for  Studies  105  and  120  are different. In Study 105, incident hypertension events were reported as adverse events (AEs), while in Study 120 prevalent events of hypertension are captured in the registry (i.e., includes incident and any pre-existing hypertension).

## Overall Analysis

In  Study  105,  12  (1.2%)  subjects  had  AEs  of  hypertension.  The  majority  of  events  were  mild  to moderate in severity, non-serious, and not assessed as related or possibly related to the study drug. Over  the  3-year  follow-up  in  Study  120,  the  prevalence  of  hypertension  was  low  ( ≤ 5%)  with  no discernible pattern.

## Subgroup Analysis

In the adult subgroup, 11 (1.5%) subjects had an AE of hypertension in Study 105; the incidence was low and similar across all treatment groups. In Study 120, the prevalence of patients with a record of hypertension was low (4.8 to ≤ 6.3%) over the 3-year follow-up (US CFF [Age ≥ 18]).

In  the  pediatric  subgroup,  only  1  (0.4%)  subject  had  an  AE  of  hypertension  in  Study  105  and  no patients had a record of hypertension in Study 120 (US CFF [Age &lt;18]).

## Organ Transplants

## Overall Analysis

There were no organ transplants reported during Study 105). Over the 3-year follow-up in Study 120, 2 (0.78%) out of the 256 patients had a record of lung transplants; 1 in 2016 and 1 in 2017.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Subgroup Analysis

There were no organ transplants in the pediatric subgroup for Study 105 or Study 120 (US CFF [Age &lt;18]).

## Summary

Overall, the trends observed in the effectiveness and safety endpoints in Study 120 were consistent with  the  long-term  maintenance  of  treatment  effect  demonstrated  in  Study  105,  in  the  overall population as well as pediatric and adult subgroups.

## Additional data from PASS Study 108

Importantly,  the  results  from  the  ongoing  PASS,  a  much  larger,  comparator-controlled  real-world study, provides additional data to evaluate the long-term effects of Orkambi. Data from the 3rd annual interim analysis (submitted 26 November 2019) included 4,628 patients in the Orkambi Safety Cohort and  5,666  patients  in  the  Comparator  Safety  Cohort.  Key  results  in  Orkambi  treated  for  the  same efficacy and safety outcomes are discussed further below:

·  ppFEV1:  A  smaller  decline  in  lung  function  over  4  years  was  observed  in  the  Orkambi  Disease Progression Cohort (n = 2,287) compared to the Comparator Disease Progression Cohort (n = 3,527) (Study 108 IA3/Figure 5). In subgroup analysis, the same trend was observed in patients 12 to &lt;18 years of age (Orkambi Disease Progression Cohort: n = 773; Comparator Disease Progression Cohort: n = 845; Study 108 IA3).

· BMI: Among patients ≥ 18 years of age, a greater increase in mean BMI was observed from 2014 to 2018 in the Orkambi Disease Progression Cohort than in the Comparator Disease Progression Cohort (Study  108  IA3/US  2018  Objective  3).  Among  patients  &lt;18  years  of  age,  mean  BMI  percentile increased  from  2014  to  2018  in  the  Orkambi  Disease  Progression  Cohort  whilst  decreasing  in  the Comparator Disease Progression Cohort.

· PEx: From 2014 to 2018, the annual proportion of patients with PEx and the annualized PEx rate per patient were stable for patients receiving Orkambi, while the annual proportion of patients with a PEx and the annualized PEx rate increased in the Comparator Disease Progression Cohort (Study 108 IA3).

·  LFTs:  The  proportion  of  patients  with  any  LFTs  &gt;1  ×  ULN  was  numerically  lower  in  the  Orkambi Safety Cohort compared to the Comparator Cohort. The proportion of patients with ALT and AST &gt;3 × ULN and total  bilirubin  &gt;2  ×  ULN  was  overall  relatively  uncommon  and  proportions  were  generally numerically lower in the Orkambi Safety Cohort or comparable between the 2 cohorts (Study 108 IA3).

· Organ Transplant: Overall, the risk of transplantation was significantly lower in the Orkambi versus the Comparator Safety Cohort (relative risk [RR] = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.57) (Study 108 IA3).

The 4th interim analysis report is expected in December 2020 and will provide additional insights to the long-term effects of Orkambi, including subgroups of adult and pediatric patients.

## Assessor's comment

As requested, the MAH has provided Study 120 effectiveness and safety endpoints separately in the subgroups  &lt;18  years  of  age  and ≥ 18  years  of  age.  The  paediatric  subgroup  results  for  Study  120 should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size (n = 48).

ppFEV1: Study 120 results showed that, in the overall population, ppFEV1 remained generally stable over the 3-year study duration (mean ppFEV1 66.34, 65.24, and 66.36, respectively in 2016, 2017, 2018).  The  sensitivity  analysis  that  included  only  subjects  with  continuous  Orkambi  exposure  from 2016 to 2018, showed in the overall population a mean decrease in ppFEV1 of -1.15 percentage point

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in  the  first  year  and  of  -0.79  in  the  second  year.  These  results are  consistent  with  the  previously published rate of lung function decline analysis in Orkambi-treated patients 12 years of age and older from  Study  105  (PROGRESS  Study)  (Konstan  et  al  2017).  This  analysis  was  performed  using propensity scores and matching a subset of Study 105 subjects (n = 455) with US CFF Patient Registry control patients (n = 1,588) who were not treated with a CFTR modulator. The estimated annualized rate  of  lung  function  decline  was  -1.33  percentage  points  in  the  Orkambi-treated  group,  which  was significantly less than the rate in matched controls (-2.29 percentage points, probability [P]&lt; 0.001).

In the subgroup of paediatric patients 12-&lt;18 years in Study 105, treated with Orkambi L400q12h/I both in the parent study and in Study 105, a mean absolute change from baseline of 2.8 percentage points was observed at 48 weeks, of 1.2 percentage points at 72 weeks, and of -0.4 percentage points observed at week 96.

In Study 120, in the subgroup of paediatric patients 12-&lt;18 years (n=48), a mean decrease of -2.1 percentage point in the first year and of -0.66 in the second year was observed in mean ppFEV1 (mean ppFEV1  76.40,  74.30,  73.64  percentage  points,  respectively  in  2016,  2017,  2018).  The  sensitivity analysis  that  included  only  subjects  with  continuous  Orkambi  exposure  from  2016  to  2018  (N=43), showed in the subgroup of patients &lt;18 years a mean decrease in ppFEV1 of -1.96 percentage point in the first year and of -1.47 percentage points in the second year. The observed decrease seems slightly lower than the annualized rate of lung function decline reported in a published analysis of US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) registry data in patients homozygous for F508del, aged 13 through 17 years, not treated with a CFTR modulator (-2.66 percentage points per year; Wegener et al, J Cyst Fibros. 2018;17(4):503-10).

Additional support for a lower rate of lung function decline with Orkambi treatment compared with an untreated  cohort  was  observed  in  the  3rd  interim  analysis  of  the  ongoing  comparator-controlled Orkambi post-authorization safety study (PASS; Study 108 Interim Analysis Report 3 [IA3]). A smaller decline in lung function over 4 years was observed in the Orkambi Disease Progression Cohort (n = 2,287) compared to the Comparator Disease Progression Cohort (n = 3,527) (Study 108 IA3/Figure 5). in the subgroup of patients 12 to &lt;18 years of age at the time of Orkambi initiation who remained on treatment through 2018 (n = 716), lung function change over 4 years (from pre-treatment baseline year  2014  to  2018)  was  -3.84  percentage  points  (approximately  -1.0  percentage  point  per  year) versus  -7.62  percentage  points  (approximately  -1.9  percentage  points  per  year)  in  the  untreated comparator patients (n = 803).

Thus, similarly to what observed in Study 105, although a trend towards a numerical decaying of effect on lung function (ppFEV1) with longer treatment duration was observed in Orkambi treated subjects in Study  120,  the  indirect  comparison  with  published  cohorts  of  US  registry  patients  homozygous  for F508del mutation untreated with CFTR modulator therapy ( Konstan et al, 2017; Wegener et al, 2018), seem to indicate a slower annual rate of ppFEV1 decline in Orkambi treated patients.

BMI : In Study 120, mean BMI was stable in the overall Orkambi cohort as well as in the subgroups ≥ or &lt; 18 years.  In the subgroup &lt;18 years, there was numerically a slight decrease of BMI for age Z scores  during  Study  120  (2016:  -0.02;  2017:  -0.08;  2018:  -0.12),  although  with  overlapping confidence intervals, and with values close to zero. For the paediatric subgroup in Study 105, BMI-forage z-scores were negative but generally improved throughout Study 105.

PEx: In the paediatric subgroup (12-&lt;18 years) of patients enrolled in Study 120 (n=48), there was a numerical increase in the proportion of subjects with at least one PEx per year, over the three year study  duration  (2016:  20/48,  41.7%;  2017:  23/48:  47.9%;  2018:  25/43:  58.1%),  although  event rates showed overlapping CI [2016: 0.94 (95% CI: 0.49, 1.38), 2017: 0.92 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.29) and 2018: 1.14 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.57)].

In the adu lt subgroup (≥18 years) of subjects enrolled in Study 120, the proportion of subjects with at least  one  PEx  per  year  was  stable  over  the  3-year  study  duration  (2016:  102/208,  49%;  2017: 93/191:  48.7%;  2018:  75/159:  47.2%;  annualized  event  rate  of  PEx:  0.93,  0.84  and  0.81, respectively in 2016, 2017 and 2018).

In Study 105, for the paediatric subgroup treated with Orkambi L400q12h/I both in the parent study and in Study 105, the annualized event rate was 0.56. For subjects ≥18 years treated with Orkambi L400q12h/I both in the parent study and in Study 105, the annualized event rate was 0.79. In Study 120, in the subgroup of paediatric subjects (12-&lt;18 years), the PEx rate seems higher compared to Study 105. However due to the different definitions used in the two studies, no conclusion may be drawn.

In the 3rd interim analysis of the ongoing PASS Study (Study 108) the annual proportion of patients with  pulmonary  exacerbations  remained  similar  from  2014  to  2018  (36.6%  in  2014  and  36.7%  in 2018).  By contrast the proportion of patients in the Comparator group increased by 8.5%.  The MAH has been requested to stratify this data by age in the next interim report of the ongoing PASS study.

Safety data coming from Study 120 seem consistent with the safety profile described in study 105.

Given that patients included in study 120 represent only a selected subgroup (roughly 25%) of the patient population enrolled in study 105 (only from US and only some from US sites who consented to participate), the comparison between Study 120 and Study 105 results is subject to limitations. It is acknowledged that due to the differences in data collection and endpoint definitions, it may not be appropriate to combine the clinical data from Study 105 and the registry-based data from Study 120 or directly compare the reported values for each endpoint. For the reasons above, even though the MAH has not provided the results of the two years of treatment in Study 105 for the subset of patients enrolled in Study 120, the issue is not further pursued.

The 4th interim analysis report of the ongoing PASS Study (expected in December 2020) will provide additional  data  on  the  long-term  effects  of  Orkambi,  including  subgroups  of  adult  and  paediatric patients.

Overall, the MAH has addressed all questions raised during the procedure satisfactorily. There are no further points. The benefit-risk assessment is considered favourable.
