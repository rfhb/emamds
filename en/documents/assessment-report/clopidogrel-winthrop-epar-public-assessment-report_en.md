## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.

Therefore, consent from the MAH of the Plavix application, which was submitted within the scope of Part B of the Annex of the Council Regulation (EEC) 2309/93, of the 22 July 1993, has been given allowing  access  to  Module  2  to  Module  5  of  the  initial  dossier  of  this  authorised  product  and  any subsequent post-marketing procedures submitted, assessed  and approved. The  application for Clopidogrel Winthrop consists only of Module 1 information.

As  a  consequence,  quality,  safety  and  efficacy  of  the  Clopidogrel  Winthrop  medicinal  product  are identical to the up-to-date quality, safety and efficacy profile of Plavix. Information on the scientific discussions  can  be  found  in  the  Plavix  CHMP  assessment  reports  and  in  the  European  Public Assessment Report (EPAR).

The approved indication is:

Clopidogrel is indicated in adults for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in:

- Patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), ischaemic stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial disease.
- Patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome:
- -Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction), including patients undergoing a stent placement following percutaneous coronary intervention, in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).
- -ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction, in combination with ASA in medically treated patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy.

Clopidogrel should be given as a single daily dose of 75 mg with or without food. In patients suffering from non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction)  clopidogrel  treatment  should  be  initiated  with  a  single  300-mg  loading  dose  and  then continued at 75 mg once a day (with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 75 mg-325 mg daily). Since higher doses  of  ASA  were  associated  with  higher  bleeding  risk  it  is  recommended  that  the  dose  of  ASA should not be higher than 100 mg.

In  patients  suffering  from  ST  segment  elevation  acute  myocardial  infarction  clopidogrel  should  be given as a single daily dose of 75 mg initiated with a 300-mg loading dose in combination with ASA and with or without thrombolytics. For patients over 75 years of age clopidogrel should be initiated without a loading dose. Combined therapy should be started as early as possible after symptoms start and continued for at least four weeks.

Clopidogrel  Winthrop  contains  clopidogrel,  which  is  a  prodrug.  The  active  metabolite,  a  thiol derivative, is formed by oxidation of clopidogrel to 2-oxo-clopidogrel and subsequent hydrolysis.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Plavix application, the quality data in support of the Clopidogrel Winthrop application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Plavix dossier which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since this application is an informed consent of the Plavix application, the non-clinical data in support of the Clopidogrel Winthrop application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Plavix dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

An environmental risk assessment was provided. No further request of information is considered necessary.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Plavix application, the clinical data in support of the Clopidogrel Winthrop application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Plavix dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The  CHMP  did  not  require  the  MAA  to  submit  a  risk  management  plan  because  the  aim  of  this submission is to obtain a duplicate form of the available clopidogrel brand Plavix, under the name of Clopidogrel  Winthrop,  using  the  same  current  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SPC).  In  this context,  this  application  does  not  represent  a  significant  change  in  the  marketing  authorisation  of clopidogrel,  and  therefore  it  is  not  considered  that  any  specific  Risk  Management  measures  are necessary.

The current SPC for clopidogrel appropriately describes the safety profile and recommendations for the  safe  use  of  this  medicinal  product,  for  which  no  additional  risk  minimization  activities  beyond appropriate labelling statements have been deemed necessary since its first marketing authorisations.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

Since this application is an informed consent of the Plavix application, the CHMP considered that the risk-benefit balance of Clopidogrel Winthrop was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation for the following indication:

'Clopidogrel is indicated in adults for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in:

- Patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), ischaemic stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial disease.
- Patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome:
- ­ Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction), including patients undergoing a stent placement following percutaneous coronary intervention, in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).
- ­ ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction, in combination with ASA in medically treated patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy.'
