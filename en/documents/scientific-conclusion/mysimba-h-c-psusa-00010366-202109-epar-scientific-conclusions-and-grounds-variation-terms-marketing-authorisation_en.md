## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for naltrexone / bupropion, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on the risk of panic attacks from a clinical trial and spontaneous reports, the PRAC considers that a causal relationship between naltrexone/bupropion and panic attacks is at least a reasonable possibility.

The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing naltrexone/bupropion should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for naltrexone / bupropion the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing naltrexone / bupropion is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
