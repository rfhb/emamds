## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Ribavirin Teva 200 mg hard capsules is a generic medicinal product containing ribavirin as an active substance.

Ribavirin is a purine nucleoside analogue which is active against a number of DNA and RNA viruses. There are numbers of proposed mechanisms of action for ribavirin. These include indirect effects such as  inhibition  of  inosine  monophosphate  and  immunomodulatory  effects  and  direct  effects  such  as polymerase inhibition and interference with viral RNA capping. Ribavirin has demonstrated antiviral activity in vitro against  respiratory  syncytial  virus  and in  vivo in  infected  cotton  rats  when administered intraperitoneally or by aerosol. Pharmacokinetic properties as well as clinical efficacy and safety have been well demonstrated for the reference medicinal product Rebetol. A single dose bioequivalence study with the Ribavirin Teva and with the reference product Rebetol was submitted to support the application. The  indication  proposed  for  Ribavirin  Teva  is  the  same  as  authorised  for  the  reference  medicinal product Rebetol. Rebetol is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C and must only be used as part  of  a  combination  regimen  with  peginterferon  alfa-2b  (adults)  or  interferon  alfa-2b  (adults  and children of 3-years of age or older). There is no safety or efficacy information on the use of Rebetol with other forms of interferon (i.e., not alfa-2b), or on the use of Rebetol with peginterferon alfa-2b in children or adolescents. 2.2 Quality aspects Introduction Ribavirin Teva is presented as hard gelatin capsules containing 200 mg of ribavirin (active substance). Capsules are  white,  opaque  and  imprinted  with  blue  ink.  The  excipients  used  in  the  preparation  of Ribavirin Teva are well known excipients used in the capsule preparations such as calcium hydrogen phosphate,  croscarmellose  sodium,  povidone  and  magnesium  stearate  (present  in  capsule  content), gelatin and titanium dioxide (present in capsule shell), shellac, titanium dioxide  and indigo carmine (present in printing ink). The capsules are packed in polyvinyl chloride / polyethylene / polyvinylidene chloride blisters (PVC/PE/PVdC blisters). Active Substance The active substance is chemically designated as 1β -D-Ribofuranosyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3carboxamide  (Chemical  Name)  or  1-[(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxolan-2-yl]1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide (Chemical IUPAC Name) and has the following structure: Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Ribavirin is a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water, slightly soluble in ethanol (96%). It has a specific optical rotation between -33.0 ° and -37.0 ° (dried basis 10mg/ml, t=20 ° C), pH 4.0-6.5.

Ribavirin may exist in two polymorphic forms A and B which are distinguishable by their melting range.  One  form  crystallised  from  aqueous  ethanol  melts  at  166 ~ 168 ° C  (form  A)  while  form crystallised from ethanol has a melting range of 174 ~ 176 ºC 9 form B). The commercially utilised manufacturing process is optimised to produce the desired polymorph.

· Manufacture Information  about  manufacturing  process  has  been  provided  using  Active  Substance  Master  File (ASMF)  procedure. A  three step synthesis involving coupling step, ammonolysis and recrystallisation has been well described. Critical parameters and accompanying in-process controls, to ensure quality of the final compound, have been defined. Confirmation of the chemical structure of ribavirin was provided by elemental analysis (confirmation of the determined elementary composition), spectroscopic methods as IR, 1 H-NMR,  13 C-NMR, MS, X-ray  powder  diffraction  (XRD)  and    differential  scanning  calorimetry  (DSC).  X-ray  diffraction studies and DSC confirm the morphology of ribavirin and confirm the proposed polymorphic form to be consistent with the compendia standard. Potential impurities have been well discussed in relation to their origin and potential carry-over into the final drug substance. · Specification The active substance specification includes tests for physical appearance and solubility, identification (IR),  specific  rotation,  loss  of  drying,  pH,  sulphated  ash,  heavy  metals,  related  substances  (HPLC), assay (HPLC), bulk and tapped density, particle size distribution, polymorphism (content of the form B), melting range and residual solvents (GC). The specification generally complies with the Ph Eur monograph for ribavirin with additional in-house tests for which suitable validation data are provided. A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Most of the methods are Ph Eur apart from  particle  size,  polymorph  testing,  melting  range,  related  substances  and  residual  solvents.  Full method validation data was provided for the non compendial (in-house) analytical methods. Particle  size  (laser  diffraction)  was  suitably  validated  for  repeatability,  intermediate  precision  and robustness. Two HPLC methods were proposed for assay and related substances. One is the same as the Ph Eur and the other is an in-house method. The latter method was suitably validated with respect to system precision, linearity, range, accuracy, recovery, method precision, limit of detection and limit of quantitation. The limit test for residue of polymorph form and determination of melting point has been suitably validated with respect to specificity, precision, accuracy, detection limit and robustness. Impurities have been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of view of safety. The GC method for residual solvents has been suitably validated for reproducibility, linearity, method precision,  accuracy  (recovery),  limit  of  detection  and  limit  of  quantitation.  All  residual  solvent acceptance  criteria  are  in  line  with  ICH  recommended  limits  and  proposed  limits  for  impurities comply with the Ph Eur monograph for ribavirin.

In general analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active substance.

Data on five consecutive batches of ribavirin was provided by the ASMF Holder. In addition data on six batches of ribavirin used in the manufacture of the biobatch and other pilot batches was provided by  the  manufacturer  of  the  medicinal  product.  All  batches  represented  full  scale  production  and complied with the requirements in the active substance specification.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Stability

Stability  studies  were  carried  out  according  to  ICH  guidelines  for  real  time  (25 ° C/60% RH)  and accelerated  conditions  (40 ° C/75% RH). Data for three validation batches are given with 60 months real  time  and  6  months  accelerated  data.  In  addition,  further  eight  batches  were  also  subjected  to stability studies. Data obtained under real time and accelerated testing showed all results to comply with the proposed specification. No specific trends were evident.

Additionally,  data  from  photostability  study  (UV  light  exposure),  and  from  stressed  degradation studies (including exposure to heat, acid and base degradation and oxidative conditions) was provided. Under stress testing both the sample batches and the reference standard degraded with the same trend and formation of similar degradation products. The stability studies confirmed the proposed re-test period. Medicinal Product · Pharmaceutical development The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain an immediate release capsule, containing quantitatively and qualitatively the same drug substance as the reference medicinal product and to be bioequivalent. Similarity  to  the  reference  medicinal  product  was  addressed  by  way  of  composition  comparisons, dissolution studies, solubility studies and comparative impurity profiles. Compositions of Ribavirin Teva capsules and the reference medicinal product are similar. Ribavirin Teva capsules contain calcium hydrogen phosphate, croscarmellose sodium, povidone and magnesium stearate. The reference product contains microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, croscarmellose sodium and magnesium  stearate.  Similarity  between  two  products  was  also  shown  with  dissolution  testing. Dissolution studies were carried out in line with the Ph Eur. The dissolution profiles for both products were similar. Solubility of ribavirin was tested in buffered solution over the physiological pH range 1.0 to 7.5. It was found to be high in all cases. An impurity comparison of Ribavirin Teva active substance and the reference product was undertaken. Results  showed  no  degradation  to  occur  as  a  result  of  the  manufacturing  process  as  the  impurity profile for the drug substance was similar to that of the product. In addition, Teva's ribavirin capsules and the reference product showed levels of impurities to be under the reporting limit. A  single-dose,  randomised,  one-period,  open-label  study  under  fed  conditions  was  conducted  to compare  the  relative  bioavailability  of  Ribavirin  Teva  200mg  capsules  to  that  of  the  reference medicinal  product  -  Rebetol  200mg  capsules.  Data  obtained  conclude  that  the  90%  confidence intervals of the relative mean AUCt, AUCinf and Cmax of the test to reference product are within the 80125% range. Results therefore show the two products to be bioequivalent under fed conditions. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The medicinal product manufacturing process development was also performed. Details were provided for experimental batches manufactured to establish optimum manufacturing conditions.  Wet granulation  was selected as  the  conventional  method  of  converting  powders  into  granules  having  a suitable flow and cohesive properties.

The first  set  of  experiments  compared  the  effect  of  different  percentages  of  the  disintegrant  on  the dissolution profile of different sizes of capsules. Experiments also allowed establishing an appropriate concentration of disintegrant in the formulation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The second set of experiments performed on a larger scale batches, examined the effect of a batch size on the physical properties and chemical results (dissolution profile). The study re-examined batches with different quantities of disintegrant in the formulation.

The scale-up batch formula was manufactured to optimise the manufacturing steps. The granulate was dried, milled and blended together with the lubricant to obtain the final blend for encapsulation. This scale-up batch details were selected and used to make the pilot batches.

· Adventitious Agents Among excipients used in the medicinal product only gelatin (component of the capsule shell) are of animal origin and Ph Eur TSE Certificates of Suitability were provided for this excipient. Magnesium stearate used in the formulation is of vegetal origin. · Manufacture of the Product The manufacturing process is sufficiently described with granulation and encapsulation being defined as the critical steps. A flow diagram and detailed description of the manufacturing process have been provided. Briefly, the manufacturing process involves (1) Premixing, (2) Granulation, (3) Drying and milling the granulate is dried and then milled, (4) Final blending, (5) Capsule filling - the mix is filled into the capsules and (6) Packaging. The critical steps in the manufacturing process are granulation and encapsulation. The homogeneity of the final blend was examined by testing for uniformity of blend during the validation procedure for two batches, one of pilot scale and one of commercial scale. Results clearly showed that the granulate is homogenous and the manufacturing process suitably controlled. At the time of submission only validation protocol was provided. This is acceptable as according to CPMP/QWP/848/96, Note for Guidance on Process Validation, 'it is recognised that, at the time of submission, process validation data may not always be available. Nevertheless it is essential that valid manufacturing processes are always utilised'. The in-process control parameters were verified during the manufacture of pilot batches. Also the applicant committed to perform validation on the first three production scale batches. · Product Specification The  product  specification  is  standard  for  capsules  and  contains  tests  with  suitable  limits  for appearance, identification (HPLC and UV), dissolution, uniformity of dosage units, assay, impurities and degradation products (HPLC), microbial limits, water content and identification of colour. Full  details  of  all  analytical  methods  are  provided.  All  non  pharmacopoeial  methods  have  been satisfactory validated. The HPLC method for assay, dissolution and impurity/degradant products has been  suitably  validated  with  respect  to  specificity,  precision,  linearity,  accuracy,  detection  limit, quantitation limit, robustness, stability of sample and standard solution.

The proposed dissolution limits is tighter than that proposed in the Ph Eur. The proposed limits for individual degradation products is in line with the qualification and identification threshold in the ICH Q3B (R2) Impurities in New Drug Products and is well justified by real time data.

Batch analysis data was provided on one pilot scale and one commercial scale batches, made using different  batches  of  the  active  substance.  Batches  met  the  proposed  specification  limits.  Results showed that capsules can be manufactured reproducibly according to the finished product specifications.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Stability of the Product

Stability  studies  were  carried  out  under  ICH  conditions  of  25ºC/60%RH  (long  term,  12 months), 30ºC/65%RH (intermediate, 3 months) and 40ºC/75%RH (accelerated, 6 months).

Batches tested under long term conditions met all the proposed specifications; appearance of capsules did  not  change,  ribavirin  assay  values  did  not  change  significantly,  dissolution  values  were  within specification, values for degradants met the proposed specifications.

Based on the stability data the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC are acceptable. In summary the stability data provided support the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and medicinal product has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were minor unresolved quality issue which has no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve it as a Follow-up Measure after the opinion, within an agreed time-frame. · Non-Clinical aspects The applicant provided an acceptable summary of the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of ribavirin based on published literature as well as reference books and information from databases. No further  non-clinical  studies  are  required  and  the  applicant  has  justified  why  no  such  data  were provided. The impurity profiles of both drug substance and medicinal product are compliant with the Ph. Eur. Monograph  and  ICH  guidance  and  are  acceptable.  The  SPC  is  in  line  with  that  of  the  authorised reference product. The  lack  of  a  formal  environmental  risk  assessment  was  justified  by  the  assumption  that  the introduction of the generic product would lead to interchange with the prescription of other ribavirin products marketed in Europe, which is unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales  volumes  for  all  ribavirin  containing  products.  Therefore  the  exposure  of  the  environment  to ribavirin  is  unlikely  to  increase  from  use  of  the  generic  product.  This  justification  was  considered acceptable. · Clinical Aspects Introduction Medicinal product no longer authorised

This  application  concerns  a  generic  medicinal  product  that  contains  a  single  strength  of  200  mg ribavirin in a hard capsule. The proposed SPC of the generic product is in line with the one of the reference product. To support the marketing authorisation application the applicant had conducted a single  dose  bioequivalence  study  with  parallel  design  under  fed  conditions  (study  R07-1285).  This study was the pivotal study for the assessment.

Scientific advice was not sought for the development programme. For the clinical assessment the Note for Guidance on Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

its  current  version  as  well  as  the  Questions&amp;  Answers  on  the  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence Guidelines (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006) are of particular relevance.

## GCP

The pivotal study was complying with GCP, as claimed by the applicant. The applicant has provided a statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trial  R07-1285  was  conducted  outside  the  community  and  was carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

- Methods

## Study design

Study R07-1285 was a single dose, randomised, open-label, one-period, parallel design bioequivalence study conducted under fed conditions.

<!-- image -->

Subjects were housed at the clinical facility on the day prior to drug administration and remained at the  clinical  facility  until  the  24  hour  blood  sample  collection.  The  randomization  scheme  was computer generated and the subjects were randomized prior to study drug administration. Dosing occurred 30 minutes after the initiation of a standardised high-fat breakfast, consisting of two eggs cooked in butter, two strips of bacon, two slices of toast with butter, four ounces of hash brown potatoes, and 240 mL of whole milk. Subjects were required to consume the entire breakfast prior to drug administration. No fluid, except that given with drug administration, was allowed from one hour prior to dose administration to one hour following dose administration. Study drug was administered with 240 ml water. Blood samples were collected within 90 minutes prior to dosing (0-hour) and after dose administration at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 96, 144, 216, 288, 432, 576, and 720 hours. Twenty-six blood samples (approximately 156 ml) were collected over the course of the study period. The  clinical  part  of  the  study,  the  bioanalytical  analyses  as  well  as  the  statistical  analyses  were performed by contract research organisations. The study protocol and consent form were reviewed and approved (with revisions) by an ethics review board. Test and reference products The test and reference product used in study R07-1285 were as follows: Test product: Ribavirin 200 mg capsules Manufactured by: TEVA Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd Batch No.: K-39306 Batch size: 130 000 Manufacturing date: 23 September 2007 Reference product:      Rebetol 200 mg capsules, marketed in the UK Manufactured by: Schering-Plough Ltd Batch No.: 6RCJA38A06 Expiry date: May 2008 Medicinal product no longer authorised

Analytical methods

The analysis of plasma samples using a LC/MS/MS method.

At the completion of the sample analysis of the samples from study R07-1285, it was observed that the assay range may not have had a sufficient lower limit of quantitation as most samples past 48 hours were below level of quantitation. The samples were then subsequently re-analysed using a different analytical method with a lower limit of quantitation .

Table 2 Demographics of participants in study R07-1285 With the initial  method,  study  samples  were  analysed  in a total  of  36  analytical  sequences,  withinstudy  accuracy  and  precision  was  within  the  acceptance  range,  95%  to  105%  and  4.2%  to  14.2%, respectively.

Both analytical methods were adequately validated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetic Variables

Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Tmax, T1/2 were determined. PK parameters for  each  individual  were  tabulated  and  graphically  presented.  Non-compartmental  analysis  and  the linear trapezoidal method were used to calculate AUC0-t. A standard pharmacokinetic approach was used  to  calculate  the  elimination  rate  constant,  T 1/2 and  AUC0-inf .  The  target  blood  collection  times were used in the pharmacokinetic calculations, except for cases where the deviations were greater than ±2 min, the actual times of collection were used.

The CHMP noted however that the AUC0-t was less than 80% of the AUC extrapolated to infinity for most of the study subjects; individual values were reported in a range of 60% to 90%. On the other hand,  none  of  the  last  blood  samples  collected  at  576-hours  and  at  720-hours  post-dose  contained measurable levels of ribavirin indicating that the blood collection time was sufficient using the current analytical  method.  Therefore,  the  sensitivity  of  the  employed  analytical  method  was  questioned.  In response  to  this  issue  the  applicant  presented  the  results  from  re-analysed  study  samples  using  an analytical method with lower limit of quantification, in which case all study subjects had detectable levels of ribavirin at 720 hours post-dose. The area extrapolated from AUC0-t to infinity was less than 10% of the AUC0-inf for most of the subjects. Except in one case the terminal elimination phase in all

Statistical methods Statistical  analyses  were  performed  for  ribavirin  plasma  concentration  data.  Analyses  of  variance (ANOVA) were performed on the ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, and Cmax.  The  ANOVA  model  containing  a  factor  for  treatment  was  utilized  in  comparing  the  effects between the treatment products. BMI (20-23, 24-26, 27-30) and gender were to be used as covariates in the ANOVA model. Interactions between treatment and covariates were examined and ruled out as appropriate.  Each  ANOVA  included  a  calculation  of  least-squares  means,  the  difference  between adjusted formulation means, and the standard error associated with this difference. Ratios  of  least-squares  means  and  90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  difference  between  drug formulation least-squares means were calculated for the parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, and Cmax using ln-transformed  data.  The  geometric  mean  values  were  reported.  All  data  were  analysed  using  SAS software. Statistical  analyses  appropriate  for  a  one-period  parallel  design  were  performed  to  assess  the bioequivalence of the two products. · Results Plasma  samples  from  all  subjects  who  completed  the  study  according  to  the  protocol  (n=87)  were analysed  and  used  in  the  statistical  analysis.  One  randomised  subject  withdrew  consent  after  study hour 144 blood draw due to schedule conflict, and is therefore not included in the analysed data set. None  of  the  pre-dose  samples  contained  detectable  levels  of  ribavirin,  which  is  expected  from  a parallel design. None of the Cmax values were detected in the first post-dose sample. The  elimination  of  ribavirin  from  plasma  appeared  to  be  polyphasic  for  most  of  the  subjects.  The terminal elimination rate constants were estimated from the plasma ribavirin data for all subjects using the plasma concentrations of the terminal elimination phase, determined from the plasma concentration versus time plots (log scale). There were multiple cases where the terminal elimination phase of ribavirin was not well characterized, i.e. non-linear after log-transformation. No values for AUC0-inf or T1/2 were reported for these cases. The  90%confidence  intervals  for  the  ratios  of  the  geometric  means  of  AUC0-t ,  AUC0-inf and  C max (ln-transformed data) were within the limits of 0.8-1.25.

Due to the fact that all subjects in this study were male, the gender covariate was not included. The interaction between treatment and BMI was performed and there was no significant interaction ( α = 0.05).  As  BMI  was  not  a  stratification  factor  in  this  study,  additional  analyses  not  including  this covariate were requested. The data showed that the 90% confidence intervals are very similar whether or not a covariate for BMI is included in the model leading to the same conclusions. The  results  of  the  statistical  analysis  of  the  ln-transformed  data  obtained  with  the  new  analytical method and not using BMI as covariate are presented in table 4.

Based  on  the  presented  bioequivalence  study  Ribavirin  Teva  200  mg  hard  capsules  are  considered bioequivalent with Rebetol 200 mg hard capsules. Pharmacodynamics No new pharmacodynamic data have been provided by the applicant. These data are not required for this particular application. Additional data Study 02105 In response to questions raised by the CHMP regarding the conduct of the study under fed conditions as well as the composition of the meal used in study R07-1285, the applicant provided as supportive data the report of another bioequivalence study conducted under fasting conditions (study 02105). The qualitative and quantitative formulations of the test product were the same in this study however the formulation  used  a  different  source  of  the  active  substance  therefore  the  Applicant  considered  this study as supporting data only. This was a randomised, single dose, two-way cross over study in 24 healthy volunteers (of which 21 successfully completed) in the fasted state. The wash-out period between doses was 42 days. Blood samples were collected over 96 hours post-dose. Summary data is provided in table 5. Table 5 Summary data from study 02105 Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Post marketing experience

No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country.

- Pharmacovigilance

 PSUR The PSUR submission schedule should follow the PSUR schedule for the reference product.  Description of the Pharmacovigilance system The  CHMP considered that the  Pharmacovigilance system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements. The company must ensure that this system is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market. The applicant should ensure that the pharmacovigilance activities are in line with the current safety measures applied to the reference medicinal product.  Risk Management Plan The  application  is  based  on  a  reference  medicinal  product  for  which  no  safety  concerns  requiring additional risk minimization activities have been identified. Discussion on Clinical aspects A single dose bioequivalence study in parallel design under fed conditions was conducted to support the marketing authorisation application for a generic product containing 200 mg ribavirin. The standard daily dose of ribavirin in adults is 800 mg to 1400 mg depending on the body weight in two divided doses. Ribavirin has linear pharmacokinetics after a single dose administration in a dose range  of  200  mg  to  1200  mg.  The  bioequivalence  study  was  conducted  in  healthy  volunteers  and ribavirin  dosing  may  cause  significant  side  effects.  On  the  grounds  of  safety  of  study  subjects  and linear  pharmacokinetics  of  ribavirin,  the  200  mg  dose  selected  for  the  bioequivalence  study  is acceptable. A parallel design was used in the pivotal bioequivalence study. Due to the long elimination half-life of ribavirin (80 hours), the parallel design is acceptable and is in line with the applicable guideline. The  study  was  conducted  under  fed  conditions  (high-fat  high-calorie  meal).  The  SmPC  of  the reference  product  recommends  drug  intake  with  food  to  maximise  absorption,  the  dose  could  be subsequently reduced based on the individual tolerance. It is known that food increases AUC and Cmax of  ribavirin  by  70%.  Therefore,  it  is  appropriate  to  conduct  the  bioequivalence  study  under  fed conditions in line with applicable guidelines. As supportive data the applicant submitted a single dose bioequivalence  study  in  a  crossover  design  under  fasted  conditions,  which  also  demonstrated bioequivalence under fasting conditions.

Initial pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that the AUC0-t was less than 80% of the AUC extrapolated to infinity for most of the study subjects, individual values ranged from 60% to 90%. However, none of  the  last  blood  samples  collected  at  576  hours  and  at  720  hours  post-dose  contained  measurable levels of ribavirin. A re-analyses of study samples was performed using an improved analytical assay and the applicant provided a respective statistical analysis for the bioequivalence conclusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based  on  the  available  data  it  is  concluded  that  bioequivalence  of  the  two  products  has  been demonstrated.

## Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment

<!-- image -->

The application contains adequate quality, non clinical and clinical data and the bioequivalence has been shown. A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen reference  medicinal  product,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are required beyond those included in the product information. Recommendation Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered by consensus decision that the benefit/risk ratio of Ribavirin Teva in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C as part of a combination regimen with peginterferon alfa-2b (adults) or interferon alfa-2b (adults, children (3-years of age or older),  and  adolescents)  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the  marketing authorisation.
