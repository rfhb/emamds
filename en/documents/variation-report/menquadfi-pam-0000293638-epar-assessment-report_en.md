The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Study MEQ00074 - A Phase III, open-label, single-centre study to describe the immunogenicity and safety of a single dose of MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine in participants aged 12 months and older in Vietnam.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study MEQ00074 A Phase III, open-label, single-centre study to describe the immunogenicity and safety of a single dose of MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine in participants aged 12 months and older in Vietnam.

## Description

Study MEQ00074 is a Phase III, open-label, single-centre study (1 main site [Centre 0001] with 3 satellite sites [participant enrolment took place at Centres 0003 and 0004 while sample processing was carried out at Centre 0002]), to describe the immunogenicity and safety of a single dose of MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine (MenQuadfi) in participants aged 12 months and older in Vietnam.

MEQ00074 was conducted from 18 January 2024 (first participant first visit) to 31 March 2024 (last participant last visit).

Database lock for the provided CSR (Final CSR Version 1.0, dated 8 August 2025) was 17 April 2025.

## Methods

## Study design

A total of 446 participants were to be enrolled with the aim to obtain a total of 400 evaluable participants:

- 223 participants were 12-23 months of age
- 223 participants were 24 months of age and above. To ensure all sub-groups were represented, within the 24 months of age and above group, a minimum of 20 participants were enrolled from each of the sub-groups mentioned below:
- o Children 2 to 9 years of age
- o Adolescents 10 to 17 years of age
- o Adults 18 to 55 years of age
- o Older adults 56 years and above

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Blood sampling:

All participants were to provide blood samples for immunogenicity assessments at baseline (prevaccination, Visit 1 on D01) and 443/446 participants provided blood samples at 1-month postvaccination on Visit 2 (D31 [+14 days]).

## Objectives

## Immunogenicity

To describe the antibody responses to meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y before and 30 days after the administration of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine.

## Safety

To describe the safety profile of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Immunogenicity

- Antibody titres against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y measured by serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA) were assessed before and 30 days (+14 days) after vaccination with a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety

The safety profile was evaluated within 30 days (+14 days) after vaccination. The following endpoints were used for the evaluation of safety:

- Presence of any unsolicited systemic adverse events (AEs) reported in the 30 minutes after vaccination.
- Presence of solicited (prelisted in the participant's diary card [DC] and case report form [CRF]) injection site and systemic reactions starting any time from the day of vaccination through 7 days after vaccination.
- Presence of unsolicited (recorded in a DC) non-serious AEs up to 30 days after vaccination; unsolicited nonserious AEs occurring after Day 31 (D31) are presented in a specific listing.
- Presence of serious adverse events (SAEs) (including adverse events of special interest [AESIs]) throughout the study, i.e. from D01 (vaccination) to the last study day D31; SAEs occurring after D31 were also to be reported if they were considered related to vaccination with the investigational medicinal product (IMP).

Depending on the items, the endpoints recorded or derived included: nature (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] preferred term), time of onset, duration/number of days of occurrence, intensity, relationship to the vaccine, whether the AE led to early termination from the study, outcome, and seriousness criterion.

## Sample size

A total of 446 participants were to be enrolled in the study, 223 participants were to be enrolled in age category 12 months to 23 months, 223 participants were to be enrolled in age category 24 months and above. An estimated 10% non-adherence rate from enrolment resulted in approximately 400 evaluable participants in total, and 200 evaluable participants in each age category (12 months 23 months, ≥ 24 months).

The overall evaluable study cohort (N=400) provided a probability of approximately 95% of observing any AE (at least 1 occurrence) with a true incidence of 0.75%.

For participants aged 12 to 23 months, 200 participants provided a probability of approximately 95% of observing any AE (at least 1 occurrence) with a true incidence of 1.5%.

For participants aged 24 months and above, 200 participants provided a probability of approximately 95% of observing any AE (at least 1 occurrence) with a true incidence of 1.5%.

FAS: Participants who received the study vaccine and had a valid post-vaccination serology result.

SafAS: Participants who received the study vaccine and had any safety data available.

PPAS: Subset of the FAS. Participants presenting with at least 1 of the following relevant protocol deviations were excluded from the PPAS:

- Participants did not meet all protocol-specified inclusion criteria or met at least one of the protocol-specified exclusion criteria.
- Participant did not receive vaccine.
- Preparation and / or administration of vaccine was not done as per-protocol.
- Participants did not provide the post-vaccination serology sample at Visit 2 in the proper time window, or a postvaccination serology sample was not drawn.
- Participants received a category 2 or 3 protocol-prohibited therapy / medication / vaccine.
- Participants had other protocol violations that affected the participant's immune response, as determined by the clinical team before locking the database.

In addition to the reasons listed above, participants were excluded from the PPAS if their Visit 2 serology sample did not produce a valid test result.

## Immunogenicity Endpoint

No statistical hypotheses will be tested. Descriptive statistics will be provided for the antibody titres against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y by using hSBA before and 30 days after a single dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine.

All immunogenicity analyses will be performed on the PPAS. Additional immunogenicity analyses will be performed for exploratory purposes on the FAS.

In general, categorical variables will be summarized and presented by frequency counts, percentages, and CIs. The 95% CIs of point estimates will be calculated using the normal approximation for quantitative data and the exact binomial distribution (Clopper-Pearson method) for percentages. For GMTs, 95% CIs of point estimates will be calculated using normal approximation assuming they are log10-normally distributed.

Descriptive analyses of antibody responses to A, C, W, and Y serogroups using hSBA will include but not be limited to:

- GMTs and 95% CI.
- Titre distribution and reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs).
- Percentage of participants with titre s ≥ 4 -fold rise from pre-vaccination to postvaccination, and 95% CI.
- Percentage of participants with hSBA titre s ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8, and 95% CI .
- Percentage of participants with hSBA vaccine seroresponse, and 95% CI.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Note: hSBA vaccine seroresponse for serogroups A, C, W, and Y is defined as:

- o For a participant with a pre-vaccination titre &lt; 1:8, the post-vaccination titre must be ≥ 1:16 .
- o For a participant with a pre-vaccination titre ≥ 1:8, the post -vaccination titre must be at least 4-fold greater than the pre-vaccination titre.

## Safety Endpoints

No statistical hypotheses will be tested.

Safety results will be described for participants in the study. The main parameters for the safety endpoints will be described by 95% CIs (based on the Clopper-Pearson method).

Depending on the items, the endpoints recorded or derived could include: nature (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] preferred term), time of onset, duration/number of days of occurrence, intensity, relationship to the vaccine, whether the AE led to early termination from the study, outcome, and seriousness criterion.

All safety analyses will be performed on the SafAS.

## Interim Analyses

No analyses are planned to be performed prior to the formal completion of the study.

## Results

## Participant flow

Participant enrolment took place at Centres 0003 and 0004 that enrolled 447 participants in Vietnam. At study centre level, the proportion of participants enrolled in each age group was not homogeneous:

## Protocol deviations

No participants presented critical deviations. A total of 25 participants (5.6%) presented at least 1 major protocol deviation: 23 participants (10.3%) in the 12-23 months of age group and 2 participants (0.9%) in the 24 months of age and above group. Most of the protocol deviations were due to administration of protocol prohibited therapy/medication/vaccine for 23 participants (5.1%), and mainly in 12-23 months of age group for 21 participants.

## Safety results

Solicited adverse event (AE) information was collected for vaccination day and 7 days after vaccination (D01-D08); unsolicited AE information was collected from Visit 1 (D01) to Visit 2 (D31 [+14 days]), and serious adverse event (SAE) information (including adverse events of special interest [AESIs]) was collected throughout the study period.

Per Protocol version 1.0 dated 29 March 2021, an AESI is an event for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the Investigator to the Sponsor must be done. The following SAEs will be captured as serious AESIs throughout the study:

- Generalized seizures (febrile and non-febrile)
- Kawasaki disease
- Guillain-Barré syndrome
- Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)

These events have been listed as AESIs based on the feedback received from the European Union regulators for the MenACYW conjugate vaccine.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

## Design and conduct

Study MEQ00074 was a Phase III, open-label study to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of a single dose of MenQuadfi in 447 enrolled participants in Vietnam, of which 446 participants (99.8%) actually received MenQuadfi. The study population was analysed depended on participants' allocation to one of two age groups: 12 to 23 months of age (designated Toddlers as per protocol) or 24 months of age and above. Of note, MenQuadfi is approved in the EU for individuals aged 12 months and older and thus in the enrolled age groups. The MAH enrolled a minimum of 20 participants per one of the 4 subgroups (Children 2 to 9 years of age, Adolescents 10 to 17 years of age, Adults 18 to 55 years of age, and Older adults 56 years and above) of the 24 months of age and above group to ensure that all of these subgroups were represented.

The study period was from 18 January 2024 (first participant first visit) to 31 March 2024 (last participant last visit). Mean study participant duration was 41 days (SD: 3.2). It is noted that the study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

report of this paediatric study (MEQ00074) was not submitted within 6 months after study completion as required with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, as amended, since the last visit of the last participant was on 31 March 2024, according to the CSR. It is also unclear why the database lock negligible impact of this study on the overall benefit-risk balance of MenQuadfi, no issue is made.

The sample size was oriented on safety evaluation with an anticipated 10% non-adherence rate to probability of approximately 95% of observing any AE (at least 1 occurrence) with a true incidence of least 1 occurrence) with a true incidence of 1.5% in each of the two age groups.

(17 April 2025) was almost one year after the last contact with the last participant. However, given the The MAH noted that this study was a single-centre study including 1 main centre with 3 satellite sites, and participant enrolment was conducted in 2 satellite sites (Centre 0003 and Centre 0004), whereas in the third satellite site sample processing was carried out. The proportions of participants of each age group in the two centres differed: n=89 (39.9%) of those aged 12-23 months and n=101 participants (45.1%) of those aged 24 months and above in Centre 0003 vs n=134 participants (60.1%) of those aged 12-23 months and n=123 participants (54.9%) of those aged 24 months and above in Centre 0004. However, no concern is raised in this regard. Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the 1 st  study vaccination or planned receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks following study vaccination (except for monovalent pandemic and multivalent influenza vaccines) or previous vaccination against meningococcal vaccine containing Serogroups A, C, W, or Y or meningococcal B serogroup-containing vaccine was not allowed; additionally, participants with history of any N. meningitidis infection, confirmed either clinically, serologically, or microbiologically and who were at high risk for meningococcal disease during the study were excluded. There were more female than male participants in both age groups, n=118 females (52.9%) and n=105 males (47.1%) in the 12-23 months of age group and n=130 females (58.0%) and n=94 males (42.0%) in the 24 months of age and above group. The mean age in the 12-23 months of age group was 17.6 months (SD: 3.20) whereas in the 24 months of age and above group was 28.9 years (SD:23.3). No concern is raised on that aspect. At least 1 major protocol deviation was reported for n= 23 participants (10.3%) in the 12-23 months of age group and n=2 participants (0.9%) in the 24 months of age and above group, mostly due to due to administration of protocol prohibited therapy/medication/vaccine: n=21 (9.4%) and n=2 (0.9%) in the 12-23 months of age group and the 24 months of age and above group, respectively. This is of no concern as this is not unexpected, in particular for the toddler population. Data was analysed descriptively. Immunogenicity was evaluated by measuring hSBA (human complement serum bactericidal assay) antibody titres against meningococcal Serogroups A, C, Y, and W at baseline (before vaccination) at Day 1 (Visit 1) and at Day 31 (Visit 2, +14 days) after vaccination. Titres were presented as GMTs, percentages of participants with titre s ≥ 4 -fold rise from pre-vaccination to postvaccination, percentages of participants with hSBA titre s ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8, and percentages of participants with hSBA vaccine seroresponse (seroresponse was defined as a postvaccination titre of ≥ 1:16 for a participant with a pre -vaccination titre &lt; 1:8, or a post-vaccination titre of at least 4-fold greater than the pre-vaccination titre for a participant with a pre-vaccination titre ≥ 1:8). Apparently, immunogenicity of non-meningococcal vaccines was not evaluated. have at least 400 participants overall and at least 200 participants per age group in order to provide a 0.75% in the overall study population, and a probability of approximately 95% of observing any AE (at

All immunogenicity analyses were performed on the full analysis set (FAS), defined as the participants who received the study vaccine and had a valid post-vaccination serology result, and the PPAS, a

subset of the FAS, excluding participants presenting with at least 1 relevant protocol deviations. All safety analyses were performed on the Safety Analysis Set (SafAS), which included participants who received the study vaccine and had any safety data available.

## Immunogenicity data analyses

Titres after a single vaccination with MenQuadfi against Serogroups C, Y, and W, hSBA titres in both groups, 12-23 months of age and 24 months of age and older, were of similar magnitude. However, titres against Serogroup A were higher in the 12-23 months of age group than in the 24 months of age and older group, e.g., as regards seroresponse rate: 81.5% (95% CI: 75.4%; 86.6%) vs 66.5% (95% CI: 59.9%; 72.7%), respectively.

Likewise, MenQuadfi elicited hSBA titre s ≥ 1:8, which can be considered as seroprotection titre, against Serogroups C, Y, and Y in almost all study participants of both age groups. However, in the 1223 months of age group, hSBA titre s ≥ 1:8 against Serogroup A were achieved by 93.5% (95% CI: 89.1%; 96.5%) of participants in contrast to the 24 months of age and older age group where the percentage of participants with hSBA titre s ≥ 1:8 against Serogroup A was lower in comparison with 84.6% (95% CI: 79.2%; 89.1%).

Of note, percentages of participants with hSBA titre s ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8 at baseline before vaccination were higher for Serogroup A than for Serogroups C, Y, and W in both age groups, e.g., for those aged 12-23 months of age, the percentage of participants with hSBA titre s ≥ 1:4 was 79.5% (95% CI: 73.2; 84.9) at Day 1 and percentage of participants with hSBA titre s ≥ 1:8 was 25.0% (95% CI: 19.2%; 31.6%). This indicates that immunity against Serogroup A had been acquired in this population to some extent, prior to enrolment in the study, and consequently, the actual immune responses (and their elicitation by MenQuadfi) against Serogroup A could be overestimated, in particular for those aged 12-23 months of age.

Taken together, the observations reported are deemed to be likely a consequence of several factors combined, i.e., the weaker elicitation of titres against Serogroup A (compared to Serogroups C, Y, and W), the fact that the immune system's responsiveness decreases with age (which is also demonstrated by the analyses per age sub-group) but also the prior immunity towards Serogroup A. However, it must be noted that since the sample size was oriented on safety evaluation and not on immunogenicity investigation and no hypotheses were formulated or tested in this regard, a comprehensive data interpretation is limited to some extent.

## Safety data analyses

Immediate unsolicited systemic AEs were collected within 30 minutes after each vaccination. Solicited reactions within solicited period after vaccine injection (within 7 days, from Day 1 to Day 8) were further distinguished in injection site reactions and systemic reactions. Unsolicited AEs were collected from Visit 1 (Day 1) to Visit 2 (Day 31 [+14 days]) and were further distinguished in unsolicited adverse events and unsolicited adverse reactions (i.e., considered related). Serious adverse event (SAE) information (including adverse events of special interest [AESIs]) was collected throughout the study period. An AESI was defined as an event for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the Investigator to the Sponsor must be done, and included Generalized seizures (febrile and nonfebrile), Kawasaki disease, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). This is all acceptable.

## Immediate unsolicited AEs reported within 30 minutes of vaccination

There were no immediate unsolicited AEs reported within 30 minutes of vaccination for the 12-23 months of age group. In contrast, one subject (0.4%) experienced an immediate unsolicited AE within 30 minutes of vaccination (high blood pressure in a 46-year-old male participant), which was assessed as not related to the vaccine by the Investigator to which can be agreed.

## Solicited reactions within 7 days following vaccination

Incidence of solicited reactions was reportedly higher in the 12-23 months of age group than the 24 months of age and older group: n=48 participants (21.5%) vs n=39 participants (17.5%), respectively. Although the number and percentage of participants with at least 1 solicited injection site reaction was the same (13%, n=29), the number and percentage of participants with at least 1 solicited systemic reaction were higher in the 12-23 months of age group than the 24 months of age and older group: 15.2% (n=34) vs 10.8% (n=24), respectively. In the 12-23 months of age group, tenderness was the most frequently solicited injection site reaction (n=36, 11.7%), followed by erythema (n=13, 5.8%) and swelling (n=9, 4.0%). In contrast, in the 24 months of age and older group, injection site pain was the most frequently solicited injection site reaction (n=23, 10.3%), followed by erythema (n=11, 4.9%) and swelling (n=5, 2.2%). According to the submitted data, in the 12-23 months of age group, Grade 3 solicited injection site reactions were reported in n=3 participants (1.3) but also Grade 3 solicited administration site reactions consisted of both erythema and swelling reported by 2 participants (0.9% each), which is confusing; however, none of those ongoing at Day 9. For the 24 months of age and older group, no solicited administration site reactions were ongoing on Day 9 and there were no Grade 3 solicited administration site reactions reported. The most frequently reported solicited systemic reaction in the in the 12-23 months of age group was appetite lost (n=17, 7.6%), followed by fever (n=16, 9.3%), abnormal crying (n=13, 5.8%), and irritability (n=11, 4.9%), whereas in the 24 months of age and older group, the most frequently reported solicited systemic reaction was myalgia (n=15, 6.7%), followed by malaise (n=13, 5.8%), headache (n=11, 4.9%), and fever (n=6, 3.3%).

## Unsolicited AEs

The number and percentage of unsolicited AEs differed between the 12-23 months of age group and the 24 months of age and older group with n= 50 (22.4%) and n=12 (5.4%), respectively. However, none of those were considered an unsolicited adverse reaction. In the 12-23 months of age group, most participants experienced upper respiratory tract infection (9.9%), followed by upper respiratory tract inflammation (4.5%), and pneumonia (2.7%), whereas, in the 24 months of age and older group pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, and hypertension were experienced in 0.9% of participants each, followed by food allergy, appendicitis, tonsillitis, rib fracture, hepatic enzyme increased, tendonitis, pleural effusion, and upper respiratory tract inflammation in 0.4% of participants each.

In the 12-23 months of age group, n=4 Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were reported for 3 participants (1.3%): One participant experienced pneumonia on Day 1 after administration, which required medication and hospitalization and resolved; this event was also evaluated as SAE. One participant reported 2 unsolicited AEs which were evaluated as Grade 3 intensity during at least 1 day, i.e., Pneumonia which started on Day 19 after administration and required medication and hospitalization and resolved (assessed as SAE), and an anaphylactic reaction which started on Day 28 after administration and required medication and hospitalization and resolved (the reaction was caused by antibiotics (ampicillin and sulbactam) used to treat pneumonia, assessed as SAE). One participant reported pneumonia on Day 23 after administration, which required medication and hospitalization and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

resolved (this event was evaluated as Grade 3 intensity during at least 1 day and assessed as SAE). All were considered not related to the study vaccine by the Investigator, which can be agreed given the nature of the events.

In the 24 months of age and older group, n=3 Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were reported in 2 participants (0.9%): One participant reported appendicitis on Day 19 after administration, which required medication and hospitalization and resolved (this event was evaluated as Grade 3 intensity during at least 1 day and was assessed as SAE). One participant reported 2 unsolicited AEs that were evaluated as Grade 3 intensity during at least 1 day (rib fracture, which started on Day 20 after administration, required medication and hospitalization and resolved, assessed as SAE; and a pleural effusion, which started on Day 23 after administration, required medication and resolved, not assessed as SAE). Those were considered not related to the study vaccine by the Investigator; this judgment can be agreed to considering the nature of the events.

For both age groups, there were no AEs that caused participants to discontinue from the study within 30 days of vaccination and no deaths or AESIs during the study. All reported SAEs were unsolicited AEs and are addressed above.

In summary, although no significant concern arises from the observations reported, it is clearly noted that the open-label design does not allow for an adequate conclusion on safety, and the sample size is considered limited, additionally impairing interpretation.

## 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

The MAH submitted data of Study MEQ00074 'A Phase III, open-label, single-centre study to describe the immunogenicity and safety of a single dose of MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine in participants aged 12 months and older in Vietnam', a stand-alone study that is not included in the MenQuadfi Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP).

MenQuadfi is authorised for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and older against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria (N.) meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y. Consequently, Study MEQ00074's population being entirely comprised of participants aged 12 months and older is covered by the currently effective EU Marketing Authorisation of MenQuadfi.

Of note, a type II variation intended to extend the indication to individuals aged 6 weeks to below 12 months is currently ongoing. However, Study MEQ00074 has not been included in the data package for that procedure. Moreover, the MAH has not submitted any amendments to the Product Information as part of this Article 46 procedure.

As regards immunogenicity, titres after a single vaccination with MenQuadfi against Serogroups C, Y, and W, hSBA titres in both groups, 12-23 months of age and 24 months of age and older, were of similar magnitude. In contrast, titres against Serogroup A were higher in the 12-23 months of age group than in the 24 months of age and older group.

Of note, percentages of participants with hSBA titre s ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8 at baseline before vaccination were higher for Serogroup A than for Serogroups C, Y, and W in both age groups, which indicates that immunity against Serogroup A had been acquired in this population to some extent, prior to enrolment in the study, and consequently, the actual immune responses (and their elicitation by MenQuadfi) against Serogroup A could be overestimated, in particular for those aged 12-23 months of age.

Taken together, the observation reported are deemed to be likely a consequence of several factors combined, i.e., the weaker elicitation of titres against Serogroup A (compared to Serogroups C, Y, and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

W), the fact that the immune system's responsiveness decreases with age (which is also demonstrated by the analyses per age sub-group) but also the immunity towards Serogroup A prior to the study. However, it must be noted that since the sample size was oriented on safety evaluation and not on immunogenicity investigation and no hypotheses were formulated or tested in this regard, a comprehensive data interpretation is limited to some extent.

Concerning safety, although no significant concern arises from the observations reported, it is noted that the open-label design does not allow for an adequate conclusion on safety, and the sample size is considered limited, additionally impairing interpretation.

Overall, no concerns arise from the study results and the benefit-risk balance of MenQuadfi remains positive in the approved indication. No updates of the PI are necessary.
