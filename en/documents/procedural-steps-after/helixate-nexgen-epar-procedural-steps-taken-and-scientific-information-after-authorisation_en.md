1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions

are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| A31/0178 | Pursuant to Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC, Germany initiated a procedure on 6 July 2016 based on concerns resulting from the evaluation of data from pharmacovigilance activities. The PRAC was requested to assess the potential impact of the results of the SIPPET study (which concluded that recombinant factor VIII medicines had a higher incidence of inhibitor development than plasma-derived medicines), and to issue a recommendation as to whether the marketing authorisations of these products should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. The EMA concluded in September 2017 that there is no clear 14/09/2017 Medicinal product | 16/11/2017 SmPC and PL Please refer to the assessment report: human coagulation factor VIII - EMEA/H/A-31/1448 |

|                    | and consistent evidence of a difference in the incidence of inhibitor development between the two classes of factor VIII medicines: those derived from plasma and those made by recombinant DNA technology. Due to the different characteristics of individual products within the two classes, EMA concluded that the risk of inhibitor development should be evaluated individually for each medicine, regardless of class. The risk for each product will continue to be assessed as more evidence becomes available.   |            |                | longer           |                                   |

| A20/0143 | Pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the European Commission requested the Agency to re-evaluate the benefit-risk balance of Kogenate Bayer and Helixate Nexgen in light of newly available data on the increased risk of inhibitor development in previously untreated patients compared with other factor VIII products and to give its opinion on whether the marketing authorisation in the approved indication should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. The PRAC considered the publication of the results of the RODIN/PedNet study, the preliminary findings from the European Haemophilia Safety Surveillance System (EUHASS) registry and all available data submitted from clinical trials, observational studies, published literature and quality data for Kogenate Bayer and Helixate NexGen with regards to its potential risk of inhibitor development in previously untreated patients (PUPs). The PRAC noted that the efficacy of Kogenate Bayer/Helixate NexGen is not questioned and, on the basis of the available data, concluded that the current results do not confirm an increased risk of developing antibodies against Kogenate Bayer and Helixate NexGen when compared with other factor VIII products in PUPs with the bleeding disorder haemophilia A.

| WS/0458 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Submission of the final study report of the Leopold I study and its extension. The study was a two-part, randomised, cross-over, open-label trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety profile of a novel formulation plasma protein-free recombinant FVIII in previously treated subjects with severe haemophilia A under prophylaxis therapy. The study compared the novel formulation with the existing one of Kogenate Bayer/Helixate NexGen and was submitted under Art. 46 of the paediatric Regulation EC/1901/2006. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority Medicinal product | 21/11/2013 no | The MAH submitted paediatric data for the marketed product KOGENATE Bayer from the Leopold I study in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. The PK analyses included the determination of BAY 81-8973, an investigational product, and KOGENATE Bayer. A lower AUC and t1/2 was observed for both drugs as a result of a higher clearance in the paediatric population. Section 4.2 of the SmPC already contains information on long term prophylaxis against bleeding in younger patients with severe haemophilia A, where it is suggested to have shorter dose intervals or higher doses. This information is consistent with the PK results from the study. Safety and tolerability were consistent with the known profile. No new safety concerns were identified. No changes to the product information in relation to the data submitted were considered necessary. |

Submission of the final report of a single dose, open- label, randomized, crossover study in subjects with severe or moderate Haemophilia A to compare the bioavailability of 2 different strengths of Kogenate FS (BAY 14-2222).

No new safety concerns were identified and tolerability was consistent with the other strengths of the product. Thus, no changes to the product information were considered necessary. The CHMP considers the obligation to perform a bioequivalence study for the 3000 IU strength fulfilled. authorised   |

| WS/0427/G | This was an application for a group of variations following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to include a warning on cardiovascular risk in haemophilic patients following two reports of myocardial infarction which occurred after administration of Kogenate Bayer/Helixate NexGen in patients with haemophilia A. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. Additional changes are made throughout the SmPC to bring it in line with the core SmPC for human plasma derived and recombinant coagulation factor VIII products. Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version Medicinal product | 19/09/2013   | 20/02/2014 SmPC, II, Labelling and no longer | Annex PL Haemophilic patients with cardiovascular risk factors or diseases may be at the same risk to develop cardiovascular events as non-haemophilic patients when clotting has been normalized by treatment with FVIII. Elevation of FVIII levels following administration, in particular with existing cardiovascular risk factors, might put a patient at least into the same risk for vessel closure or myocardial infarction as for the non-haemophilic population. Consequently, patients should be evaluated and monitored for cardiac risk factors.                                                                         |

The following wording was agreed with the CHMP: \"In clinical studies, Helixate Nexgen has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days). Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with Helixate Nexgen developed inhibitors: Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU. The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days). The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range: 4-478). Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post- study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor. The fifth patient was lost to follow-up. In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed. In extensive post-registration studies with Helixate Nexgen, involving more than 1000 patients the following was |
