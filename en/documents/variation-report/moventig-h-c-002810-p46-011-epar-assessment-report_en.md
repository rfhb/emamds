<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

D3820C00016 (SAFARI): A Phase 1, Open-label, Multicenter Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics and Safety  of  Naloxegol  in  Pediatric  Patients  Ages ≥ 6  Months  to  &lt;18  Years  Receiving  Treatment  with Opioids

## Description

## Methods

## Study participants

This  is  a  phase  I,  open-label  study  to  assess  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and  safety  of  naloxegol  in paediatric patients ages ≥ 6 months to &lt;18 years receiving treatment with opioids and presenting with opioid-induced constipation (OIC) or at risk of OIC. There are 3 different age groups and initially it was planned for each age group to have 2 cohorts.

## Inclusion criteria

For inclusion in the study patients should fulfil the following criteria:

1.  Written  informed  consent  for  study  participation  must  be  obtained  prior  to  any  study-related procedures being performed (local regulations are to be followed in determining the assent/consent requirements for children and parent[s]/guardian[s]) and according to international guidelines and/or applicable European Union guidelines;

2. Patients between the ages of ≥ 6 months and &lt;18 years;
3. Patients with malignant or non-malignant pain who are receiving (or are about to receive) acute or chronic treatment with opioids;

4.  In  the  investigator's  judgment,  patients  must  be  either  newly  diagnosed  with  constipation  or patients  must  have  a  history  of  constipation  treated  with  laxatives  or  be  expected  to  develop constipation after initiation of opioid treatment;

5. Patients must have the ability to be present in the clinic for at least 10 hours following the first dose of naloxegol for PK sampling and post first dose tolerability observations;

6. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening. Females of  childbearing  potential  must  either  not  be  sexually  active  or  be  using  an  adequate  birth control method throughout the duration of the study;

7. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures.

## Exclusion criteria

Patients should not enter the study if any of the following exclusion criteria are fulfilled:

1. Involvement of a parent or guardian in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both KKI staff and/or staff at the study site);
2. Previous enrolment in the present study with intake of naloxegol IP;

History  of  an  intra-abdominal  or  peritoneal  neoplasm  or  an  ongoing  GI-related  issue  (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, connective tissue disorders like Ehler Danlos, dermatomyositis, scleroderma) which, in the opinion of the investigator, may be contributing to constipation as a result of  mechanical  obstruction  or  may  place  the  patient  at  increased  risk  for  intestinal  perforation  by impairing the local or global structural integrity of the GI tract;

6.  Signs  or  symptoms  of  GI  obstruction  including  faecal  impaction  requiring  medical  intervention. History  of  GI  obstructive  conditions  (e.g.  Hirschsprung's  disease,  malrotation,  volvulus,  pseudoobstruction syndromes);

7.  Currently  active  medical  conditions  or  ongoing  treatments  (e.g.  irinotecan)  that  may  result  in diarrhoea or intermittent loose stools during the screening or treatment period;
8. Significant cardiorespiratory dysfunction or haemodynamic instability;
9. Evidence of known widespread cancer metastases in the CNS;
10. Radiotherapy between the diaphragm and the pelvis in the 4 weeks prior to screening or planned to be initiated during the treatment period;

11. Any of the following findings and/or conditions:

(i) For patients 6-12 months old, any elevation of serum direct or indirect bilirubin, and/or elevation of LFTs not associated with their underlying disease and associated treatment, that have not undergone a medical  work  up.  For  patients  over  1  year  old,  serum  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  or  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or serum bilirubin &gt;1.2 x ULN (unless known to be due to Gilbert's syndrome or sickle cell disease).

## Treatments

## Treatments Administered

For this pediatric study, the subject was administered naloxegol oral tablets or naloxegol liquid oral formulation (Table 1).

The naloxegol liquid oral formulation was used when the available tablets could not accommodate the dosing algorithm, as well as in cases when a subject could not swallow solid tablets. For the youngest age group, only liquid oral formulation was administered. Liquid formulation was taken orally or given through a naso-gastric or gastric tube.

On PK sampling days (Day 1, Day 2,  and Day 7 [as appropriate]), the IP  was  taken  on  an  empty stomach at least 1 hour prior to the first meal of the day or 2 hours after the meal. All subjects could have eaten solid or liquid food 1 hour after dosing (Protocol Version 6.0) or 2 hours after dosing (prior to Protocol Version 6.0). A moderate amount of water was allowed up to 1 hour prior to dosing and could  have  been  resumed  1  hour  after  dosing.  Subjects  were  encouraged  to  avoid  consumption  of grapefruit or grapefruit juice during the treatment of naloxegol.

## Dose and Treatment Regimens

Naloxegol was administered once daily as an oral dose and was taken on an empty stomach in the morning at the same time of day throughout the study.

Subjects in Cohorts 1 to 3, and those subjects already enrolled in Cohort 4 prior to Protocol Version 6.0, were dosed with a single oral dose of naloxegol on Day 1 (Visit 2) in the clinic. Subjects stayed in the clinic overnight or for at least 10 hours following the first dose of naloxegol for PK sampling and for post  first  dose  safety  and  tolerability  assessments.  If  a  subject  continued  treatment  with  naloxegol beyond Day 1, the second dose was administered in the clinic on Day 2 (Visit 3).

Those subjects enrolled in Cohort 4 after Protocol Version 6.0, and subjects in Cohort 5 were dosed with a single oral dose of naloxegol on Day 1 in the clinic.

Subjects  could  have  continued  treatment  for  up  to  6  months  (26  weeks)  depending  on  duration  of opioid treatment and tolerability of study drug as determined by the investigator and Study Physician.

## Treatment Groups and Cohort Size

There were 3 age groups: ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years; ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years, and ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years. The study proceeded sequentially from the oldest to the youngest age group. Each age group had 2 dose cohorts planned (Figure 1).

For the first age group ( ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years), the first 11 subjects (lower dose cohort) were given a dose targeted to achieve similar exposure to the exposure in adults dosed at 12.5 mg based on PBPK modeling. Subjects continued treatment for up to 6 months and were evaluated for PK, safety, and tolerability.  The  SPRC  reviewed  PK  and  safety  data  and  made  decisions  regarding  approving  the enrollment of subjects for the higher dose of naloxegol and for a lower age group.

The SPRC was an independent, external, expert group that reviewed PK study data, evaluated adverse effects  and  other  safety  data,  and  made  recommendations about enrollment of new subjects of the same age group to be administered a higher dose or enrollment of a younger age group. The SPRC consisted of 3 voting members with the following expertise: Chair: Physician with pediatric background and clinical trial experience; Pharmacokineticist: clinical pharmacologist with pharmacokinetic background, clinical trial experience, and opioid withdrawal expertise; Physician: with clinical training and experience in opioid withdrawal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The next subjects were enrolled to receive the higher dose to achieve similar exposure to that for 25 mg in the adults. This dose was based on the actual PK measurements from the lower dose and did not start until the characterization of the PK and tolerability of the lower dose cohort had been completed (Figure 1). In parallel to dosing the same age group with the higher dose, a new cohort from the lower age group was  enrolled and dosed with the 12.5 mg  adult equivalent dose. Following PK characterization  and  the  safety  assessment  of  this  age  group,  the  same  dosing  and  assessment procedure was sequentially followed for the subsequent age groups.

Lower dose cohort

The  planned  lower  doses  (starting  doses)  of  naloxegol  are  presented  in  Table  2.  The  doses  in  the various age groups were based on PBPK modeling using established in vitro and in vivo metabolic and PK information. The planned starting doses were projected to provide similar exposure (ie, area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC]) to that achieved in adults at 12.5 mg. Body-weight-based dosing was used to accommodate the variations in body size in pediatric subjects. Multiple tablets were administered  to  achieve  a  desired  dose  (eg,  17.5  mg=12.5  mg+5  mg).  The  naloxegol  liquid  oral formulation was used when the available tablets could not accommodate the dosing algorithm, as well as in cases when children could not swallow solid tablets. For the youngest age group, only liquid oral formulation  was  administered.  The  investigator  provided  appropriate  oral  and  written  study  drug instruction to subject or parent(s)/guardian(s).

## Higher dose cohort

Administration  of  the  higher  dose  of  naloxegol  in  each  age  group  was  based  on  SPRC  review  of available safety and PK data from the previous (lower) dose.

The higher dose in each age group was proposed taking into consideration the exposure observed in the  previous  (lower)  dose,  extrapolation  from  adult  PK  and  age-related  characteristics  in  PBPK modeling. The recommended dose was predicted to result in an exposure approximately corresponding to that for 25 mg naloxegol in the adult population. It was the responsibility of the SPRC to review and accept or reject the proposed dose.

KKPD communicated the decision of SPRC to the investigators and provided appropriate body-weightbased dosing schedule if applicable.

## Sample size

It was anticipated that approximately 60 subjects would be enrolled to obtain at least 36 evaluable PK subjects.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

The study is open label.

## Statistical Methods

There is no formal Statistical Analysis Plan for this study.

For Cohorts 1 to 3, at least 8 paediatric patients and for Cohort 4, at least 4 paediatric patients, were enrolled in each dose cohort with evaluable PK data (i.e., AUC). In these cohorts, rich PK sampling was utilised to characterise the PK disposition of naloxegol. This sample size in the original study protocol was determined to provide at least 80% power to target a 95% CI within 60% to 140% of geometric mean estimates of clearance and volume of distribution in each age group for naloxegol, based on an approximate  geometric  coefficient  of  variation  at  45.6%  for  AUC  (estimated  from  naloxegol  pooled clinical pharmacology data in adults) (Wang Y et al 2012). However, based on the preliminary analysis of the population PK data from Cohorts 1 to 4, the Sponsor has re-evaluated the study design including the sample size and PK sampling scheme using Population Fisher Information Matrix. The results from this PK M&amp;S support the reduction of sample size from 8 to at least 4 per cohort for Cohorts 4, 5 and 6. In addition, the M&amp;S indicates that sparse PK sampling can be used to provide additional PK data needed for population PK analysis. Thus, data from Cohorts 5 and 6 and data from patients enrolled in Cohort 4 who had sparse PK sampling will not be used to derive traditional PK endpoints, but will be used in combination with data from Cohorts 1 to 4 for population PK modelling purposes.

## Results

## Participant flow

The disposition of subjects is provided in Table 3.

A total of 12 subjects were enrolled and assigned treatment in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years, 17 subjects in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years, and 28 subjects in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years.

Of these, 6 (50.0%) subjects in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years received treatment (all lowdose), 14 (82.4%) subjects in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years received treatment (9 [52.9%] low-dose  and  5  [29.4%]  high-dose),  and  26  (92.9%)  subjects  in  the  age  group ≥ 12  years  to  &lt;18 years received treatment (11 [39.3%] low-dose and 15 [53.6%] high-dose).

No subjects were enrolled and assigned to the high-dose treatment in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years (ie, Cohort 6). The decision to not include any subjects in this age and dose cohort was approved as modifications to the PIPs by the EMA and MHRA.

In the Safety Analysis Set, none of the subjects were withdrawn from the study in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years. One (7.1%) subject in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years was withdrawn from the study, for the reason \"Other\". Six (23.1%) subjects in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years were withdrawn from the study; reasons for study withdrawal were severe noncompliance to protocol in 3 (11.5%) subjects, AE in 1 (3.8%) subject, and 'Other' in 2 (7.7%) subjects. The 'Other' reasons were specified as difficulty swallowing tablets.

b Percentages for subjects who completed/withdrew prematurely from study, and main reason for premature withdrawal are calculated out of the total number of subjects in the Safety Analysis Set.

Note:Subjectswhofailedscreening althoughdidnotreceive a treatment but were assignedwitha subjectnumber.

Note: No subjects were enrolled and assigned to the high-dose treatment in the age group ≥6M to &lt;6Y. The decision to not include any subjects in this age and dose group was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Source:Table14.1.1.

## Rapporteur comment:

Although 12 patients have been recruited in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years, only 50% of them received the actual treatment resulting in 6 patients receiving low dose treatment in cohort 1. The MAH is requested to discuss the reasons why such a high percentage of patients in this age group eventually did not receive the assigned treatment.

## Baseline data

## Demographics

Demographic characteristics are provided in Table 4.

The median age was 3.5 years (range: 0.5 to 5 years) in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years; 10.0 years (range: 7 to 11 years) in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years, and 14.0 years (range: 12 to 17 years) in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years.

Half of the subjects were male and half were female in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years and ≥ 6 years  to  &lt;12  years  (3  [50.0%]  subjects  in  the  age  group ≥ 6  months  to  &lt;6  years  and  7  [50.0%] subjects in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years), whereas most of the subjects 23 (88.5%) in the age

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years were female. The majority of subjects in the study were White (12 [85.7%] subjects in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years and 26 [100.0%] subjects in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years).

All subjects were not Hispanic or Latino with the exception of 1 subject who was Hispanic or Latino in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years (high-dose group).

## Efficacy results

## Primary Objective Results

## Single-dose Pharmacokinetic Results

PK  results  are  summarized  from  the  naloxegol  PPK  final  report  dated  08  Jul  2021.  Dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid  human  plasma  samples  were  analyzed  for  naloxegol  concentration using a validated high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry method by Labcorp Early Development Laboratories Inc. The sample analysis data met acceptance criteria. See the Bioanalytical Report in Appendix 16.1.13 for more detail.

## Non-compartmental analysis

The observed pediatric naloxegol Cmax and AUC0-∞ values are provided in Table 6.

Observed naloxegol AUC0-∞ values for the ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years pediatric age group at the 12.5 and  25  mg  adult  equivalent  dose  of  naloxegol  were  comparable  with  the  healthy  adult  values. However, naloxegol AUC0-∞ values for the ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years pediatric age group at the 12.5 mg, and 25 mg adult equivalent doses of naloxegol were only 56% and 39% of the AUC0-∞ in  adults, respectively. Lower naloxegol exposure for the ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 year pediatric age group were due to lower doses of naloxegol given according to their age and body weight. The %CVs of naloxegol AUC0-∞ at  the  12.5  mg  adult  equivalent  dose  were  48.3%  and  90.9%  for  the  2  pediatric  age  groups, respectively.

## Rapporteur comment:

According to the protocol, the 12.5 mg equivalent doses in the various age groups were based on PBPK modeling and projected to provide similar exposure to that achieved in adults at 12.5mg. For the ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 year pediatric age group, however, lower naloxegol exposure was observed compared to adults.  The  protocol  further  defines  that  for  the  higher  dose  (25  mg  equivalent),  the  exposure observed in the previous (lower) dose will be taken into account. However, it seems like this was not the case as exposure for the ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 year pediatric age group receiving the 25 mg equivalent dose is even lower (39% of AUC in adults). The MAH is asked to clarify.

In addition to AUC and Cmax of the actual dose, dose-normalized AUC and Cmax parameter estimates were  derived  based  on  the  assumption  of  linear  kinetics  of  naloxegol.  Observed  dose-normalized naloxegol AUC 0-∞ values for the 6 to &lt; 12 and 12 to &lt; 18 year pediatric age group were comparable to the healthy adult values (Table 7).

## Rapporteur comment:

Dose-normalized  AUC  and  Cmax  parameter  estimates  were  in  general  higher  for  the  pediatric subgroups compared to adults. Due to the small sample sizes and high variability, it is difficult to draw clear conclusions. Using a popPK approach (see further), exposure (6 to &lt;12 years, and 12 to &lt;18 years of age) normalized to a fixed dose seems comparable to adult exposure.

Dose proportionality of observed pediatric naloxegol Cmax and AUC0-∞ are provided in Figure 2. The reference line  with  slope  of  1.00  coincide  within  the  90%  confidence  interval  of  the  regression  line (grey shaded area) for both Cmax and AUC0-∞ . The slope of the regression line for Cmax and AUC0-∞ was not significantly different from 1.00, indicating a linear increase of exposure with increased dose of naloxegol.

Naloxegol exhibited dose-linear kinetics across the adult equivalent 12.5 and 25 mg doses in pediatric subjects receiving opioids from ≥ 6 years to &lt;18 years of age. The geometric mean Cmax and AUC0-∞ values for pediatric subjects from ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years of age receiving the adult equivalent 12.5 mg dose was 11.6 ng/mL and 96.6 hr*ng/mL. The geometric mean Cmax and AUC values for pediatric subjects from ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years of age receiving the adult equivalent 12.5 mg dose was 9.26 ng/mL and 46.1 hr*ng/mL.

## Population PK analysis

Simulated PK profiles of naloxegol following a single-dose of 12.5 mg naloxegol oral solution or tablet in the typical healthy subjects or OIC subjects are provided in Figure 3. Naloxegol plasma PK profiles of oral administration of naloxegol solution or tablets in pediatrics and adults were best characterized by a 2-compartment PK model with Weibull-type absorption. Estimated CL/F of naloxegol was 109 L/hr and Vdss/F was 668 L (V1/F + V2/F). The between subject variability (BSV) of CL/F and V1/F was 50.7%  and  63.7%,  respectively.  The  median  half-life  of  naloxegol  in  pediatric  subjects  receiving opioids (11.0 hour) was consistent to that in adults (10.6 hours). The rate of absorption of naloxegol oral tablets is ~2.55 times slower than that of naloxegol oral solution.

Covariate effects on CL/F, V1/F, and Alpha from the final PPK model are provided in Figure 4.

Key demographic parameters including age, body weight, race, hepatic impairment, renal impairment, disease state (OIC vs healthy subjects), etc. were evaluated as potential covariates. Body weight was not  a  significant  covariate  factor  on  the  CL/F  or  V1/F  of  naloxegol.  Creatinine  clearance  was  a significant covariate factor on CL/F and V1/F of naloxegol. The CL/F of naloxegol in Asian and Black (n=84) was 35% higher than that of White. In addition, the rate of absorption of naloxegol in OIC adult patients and pediatric patients receiving opioid treatment was ~2.88 times slower than that of volunteer  subjects.  A  forest  plot  was  constructed  to  illustrate  effects  of  the  covariates  meeting inclusion  criteria  on  naloxegol  parameters  of  CL/F,  V1/F,  and  Alpha  as  shown  below.  The  reference subject is an adult Caucasian subject with creatinine clearance of 110 mL/min/1.73 m2 and received oral  administration  of  naloxegol  solution.  Parameter  estimates  in  reference  subjects  are  considered 100% (vertical solid line).

Forest  plot  of  subgroup  analyses  on  percent  change  relative  to  reference  value  of  model-predicted steady-state naloxegol AUC values following a fixed 12.5 mg naloxegol oral dose once daily for 8 days are provided in Figure 5.

A forest plot was constructed to compare model-predicted steady-state naloxegol AUC in subgroups defined  by  specific  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  covariates  as  shown  below.  The  difference  in  steady-state naloxegol AUC (ie, % change relative to reference) for each covariate are based on the forest plots subgroup analysis. Neither age nor body weight were identified as a significant covariate. However, exposure to naloxegol in ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years age group (N=6) was 93% greater for a fixed dose than that in adults, as this subgroup had lower Bayesian post-hoc estimates of CL (final PED report). Exposures to naloxegol in moderate, severe, and very severe renal impairment were predicted to be 138%, 162%, and 73% greater than that in normal subjects.

## Rapporteur comment:

A separate popPK report has been provided. In general, the popPK results are presented in line with CHMP/EWP/185990/06.  An  in-depth  assessment  of  the  model  building,  evaluation  and  simulations performed will be conducted at the time of submission of the planned type II variation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subgroup analysis based on simulations of naloxegol PK profiles for a 12.5 mg dose (once daily for 8 days) using empirical Bayesian estimates of individual PK parameters of the final popPK model, show a 93% higher exposure in subjects &lt; 6 years old (n=6) compared to that in adults.

Monte Carlo simulations (see further) of the popPK model predict comparable exposure between the three pediatric age groups and adults following a fixed naloxegol dose.

PopPK predicted Naloxegol Exposures in Pediatric Subjects 6 Months to &lt; 6 Years of Age

The geometric mean (% CV) AUC following single 12.5 mg dose administration to healthy adult volunteers was 81.9 (38.3%) hr*ng/mL and ranged from 60.7 to 151.7 hr*ng/mL. The corresponding value observed in pediatric subjects from 6 months to &lt; 6 years of age (n= 6) receiving the 12,5 mg equivalent dose was 21.8 (86.7%) hr*ng/mL and ranged from 7.5 hr*ng/mL to 67.8 hr*ng/mL. The mean exposure to naloxegol in pediatric subjects was approximately 75% lower than that observed in adults. The geometric mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) (%CV) in Cohort 5 subjects was 3.36 (61.9%) ng/mL, which was approximately 80% lower than that in adults receiving a 12.5 mg dose of naloxegol [18.3 (27.0%) ng/mL].

## Rapporteur comment:

Since only sparse sampling was applied to pediatric subjects 6 Months to &lt; 6 Years of Age, the PK parameters were estimated by popPK modeling. In line with observations for subjects aged 6 to &lt;12 years, exposure after a single 12,5 mg equivalent dose was lower than that observed in adults.

Monte Carlo simulation in 3 pediatric age groups and adults

Model-predicted AUC0-∞ and Cmax of naloxegol in the three pediatric age groups, OIC adults and healthy adults were determined from Monte Carlo simulation of PK profiles after a single oral 25 mg dose of naloxegol based on the population PK parameters of the final PPK model of naloxegol. Modelpredicted naloxegol AUC0-∞ of the three pediatric age groups was 106%, 112%, and 119% of the AUC0-∞ in OIC adults, respectively.

## Subjects' Behavior and Response to the Taste of Naloxegol Liquid Formulation in Subjects ≥ 6 Months to &lt;6 Years of Age

No data were reported for any subject.

## Rapporteur comment:

The study population is considered too limited to draw any meaningful conclusions on acceptability and palatability of the naloxegol formulations.

Clinical Outcome Results

## Time (Hours) to First Postdose BM

The time in hours to the first postdose BM for subjects in the clinical outcome analysis population is provided  in  Table  11.  The  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  of  time  to  first  postdose  BM  for  subjects  in  the Safety Analysis Set is provided in Figure 6.

First postdose BMs were observed in 4 (80.0%) subjects in the low-dose group in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years, 7 (100%) subjects in the low-dose group and 5 (100%) subjects in the high-dose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

group in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years, and 6 (75.0%) subjects in the low-dose group and 9 (64.3%) subjects in the high-dose group in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years.

The  median  time  (95%  CI)  to  first  BMs  was  16  hours  in  the  low-dose  group  in  the  age  group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years, 63 hours for both low-dose and high-dose group in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years, and 110 hours and 103 hours for low-dose and high-dose respectively, in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years.

Figure 6. Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Time to First Postdose BM (Safety Analysis Set) Number of Days with a BM Each Week and Percentage of Days with a BM During Treatment

The number of days with BM each week and the percentage of days with a BM during treatment for subjects in the clinical outcome analysis population is provided in Table 12.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The median number of days with a BM per week was 7 days for subjects in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years, 4 and 6 days for subjects in the low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively, in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years, and 2.04 and 1.28 days for subjects in the low-dose group and highdose group, respectively, in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years.

The median percentages of days with BM during treatment was 100% of days for subjects in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years, 57.14% and 85.71% of days for subjects in the low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively, in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years, and 29.17% and 18.33% of days for subjects in the low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively, in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years.

## Rapporteur comment:

The number of days with a BM appears very low in the low and high dose groups in the age category ≥12 years to &lt;18 year. Because of the limited number of patients included, the clinical relevance of this observation is uncertain.

## Pharmacokinetic Results Summary

The objective of the current study was to evaluate the naloxegol exposures of adult equivalent 12.5 and  25  mg  doses  in  pediatric  subjects  receiving  opioids  from ≥ 6  months  to  &lt;18  years  of  age. Naloxegol  AUC  and  Cmax  values  for  subject  from ≥ 6  years  to  &lt;18  years  of  age  were  derived  by noncompartmental analysis (NCA). A PPK model was developed to derive the AUC and Cmax values for pediatric subjects 6 months to &lt;18 years of age.

· The  noncompartmental  PK  analysis  of  the  12.5  and  25  mg  adult  equivalent  doses  in  adolescent subjects  ( ≥ 12  to  &lt;18  years  of  age)  revealed  comparable  naloxegol  exposures  compared  to  adult subjects. The AUC values for pediatric subjects ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years of age was approximately 45% lower for the 12.5 mg (46.1 hr*ng/mL) and approximately 60% lower for the 25 mg (65.4 hr*ng/mL) adult  equivalent  exposures.  These  findings  are  expected,  since  body  weight  was  not  identified  as  a significant  covariate  in  the  PPK  analysis,  and  the  dose  adjustment  by  body  weight  is  not  needed  in pediatric subjects.

- Body weight of the subjects in this analysis ranged from 8.0 to 133.9 kg. However, CL/F and V1/F of naloxegol  were  found  to  be  independent  on  body  weight  in  this  analysis.  Based  on  this,  it  would suggest that allometric scaling of CL/F and V1/F is not needed to extrapolate the exposure of naloxegol pediatric subject ≥ 6 years to &lt;18 years of age.
-  Although  subgroup  analysis  indicated  that  exposure  to  naloxegol  in  subjects  with  mild/moderate hepatic  impairment  was  41%  higher  than  that  in  subjects  with  normal  hepatic  function,  impaired hepatic function was not found to be a significant factor on CL/F or V1/F of naloxegol. The BSV of CL/F

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and V1/F of naloxegol in the base model was 54.5% and 66.3%, respectively. After covariate model building, the BSV of CL/F and V1/F of naloxegol in the final model was 50.7% and 63.7%, respectively. This suggested that the covariate factors described approximately 4% of the variability. The BSV at this level could result in difficulty to detect significance and thus not identify impaired hepatic function, and body weight on CL/F or V1/F of naloxegol.

· Strong CYP3A4 inducer, moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, P-gp inhibitor, and P-gp inducer were found to be significant factors on CL/F of naloxegol in the previous PPK analysis of naloxegol in volunteer adult subjects and OIC adult patients. These factors were not available in the pediatric patients and were not investigated in this PPK analysis. However, the estimated BSV of CL/F of naloxegol was 48% in the previous PPK analysis, which is only 3% less than the estimate in this PPK analysis.

## Efficacy Results Summary

· Mean  palatability  score  of  naloxegol  liquid  oral  formulation  at  Visit  2  was  reported  as  59.6  for subjects in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years, and 50.0 in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years. At Visit 3, results were available for only 1 subject, age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years, who scored 100.

· For acceptability, all subjects in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years were able to swallow tablets on Day 1 and data were only available for 2 subjects for low-dose and 5 subjects for high-dose on Day 2 (who also swallowed tablets). The number of subjects with the ability to swallow the oral solution was too small to draw conclusions (1 [16.7%] subject).

· The median time (95% CI) to first BM was 16 hours in the low-dose group in the ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years age group, 63 hours for both the low-dose and high-dose group in the ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years age group, 110 hours and 103 hours for low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively, in the ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years age group.

· The median number of days with a BM per week was 7 days for subjects in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years, 4 days for subjects in the low-dose group and 6 days in the high-dose group in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years, and 2.04 days for subjects in the low-dose group and 1.28 days in the high-dose group in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years.

· The  median  number of  days  with  laxative  use  per  week  was  0  days  for  subjects  in  the  low-dose group and 3 days in the high-dose group in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years, and 4.45 days for subjects in the low-dose group and 1.46 days in the high-dose group in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years. No subjects used any laxative in the low-dose group in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years.

## Safety results

## Extent of Exposure

Exposure data are provided in Table 14.

## Oral Solution:

The mean duration on study drug was 1.5 days for subjects in the low-dose group in the age group ≥ 6 months  to  &lt;6  years,  21.3  days  and  2.2  days  for  subject  in  the  low-dose  and  high-dose  groups, respectively, in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years.

The median duration on study drug was 1.5 days for subjects in the low-dose group in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years, 1 day each, for subjects in the low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively, in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The median duration on study drug was 2 days and 1 day each for subjects in the low-dose and highdose groups, in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years. The mean duration on study drug was also 2 days and 1 day each for subjects in the low-dose and high-dose groups, in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years.

Among the subjects from all age groups, the mean duration on study drug was 12.1 days and 2 days in the low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively.

The median duration for all the subjects on study drug was 1 day each for both low-dose (range: 1 to 181 days) and high-dose (range: 1 to 5 days) groups.

The mean of total  study  drug  consumed  was  1.81  g  for  subjects  in  the  low-dose  group  in  the  age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years.

For solution: (total IP consumed [g]/total weight of expected study drug liquid [g])

For tablets: (total IPconsumed/total number of expected study drug tablets)

Total expected product consumed was calculated differently depending on the formulation:

For solution(g): (planned study drug daily dose(mg)x overall treatment duration/1000)

For tablets: (planned study drug daily number of tablets x overall treatment duration)

Note: All subjects \"low' is the total number of subjects who received a low-dose of the IP. All subjects *high' is the total number of subjects who received a high-dose of the IP. Note: Percentages were calculated out of the number of subjects in the Safety Analysis Set. Source: Table 14.3.1.1.

## Overdose Report

One subject in the high-dose group in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years was overdosed during the study due to weighing error. The subject was overdosed on Study Day 1 with a total dose of 25 mg and overdosing was not associated with AE.

Overall, among all subjects, 21 (80.8%) subjects in the low-dose group and 14 (70.0%) subjects in the  high-dose  group  reported  any  AEs.  Of  these,  7  (26.9%)  subjects  in  the  low-dose  group  and  9 (45.0%) subjects in the high-dose group reported any pre-treatment AEs.

Overall, among all subjects, 19 (73.1%) subjects in the low-dose group and 13 (65.0%) subjects in the high-dose group reported any TEAEs. Of these, a total of 7 (26.9%) subjects in the low-dose group and 2 (10.0%) subjects in the high-dose group reported TEAEs related to the study drug. One subject each, in the low-dose group (3.8%) and high-dose group (5.0%), reported TEAEs that were severe in intensity. One (5.0%) subject, in the high-dose group, reported a TEAE leading to study discontinuation; and 1 (3.8%) subject, in the low-dose group reported any SAEs during the study.

Analysis of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events

## Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term

The  most  frequent  TEAEs  ( ≥ 2%  of  all  subjects)  by  SOC  and  preferred  term  (PT)  in  the  safety population are provided in Table 16.

Note: Days since last dose is derived as the number of days since the first dose of either tablet or liquid formulation at the time of onset of the adverse event, as only first and final doses of IP were collected.

The  most  commonly  reported  TEAEs  by  SOC  among  all  subjects  were  gastrointestinal  disorder  (9 [34.6%] subjects in low-dose and 10 [50%] subjects in high-dose), followed by general disorder and administration site conditions (3 [11.5%] subjects in low-dose and 5 [25.0%] subjects in high-dose), and investigations (5 [19.2%] subjects in low-dose and 3 [15.0%] subjects in high-dose).

The most frequently reported TEAEs by PT among all subjects were nausea (5 [19.2%] subjects in lowdose and 5 [25.0%] subjects in high-dose), followed by vomiting (5 [19.2%] subjects in low-dose and 3 [15.0%] subjects in high-dose), and constipation (3 [11.5%] subjects in low-dose and 4 [20.0%] subjects in high-dose).

## Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by Investigator's Causality

The  most  frequent  TEAEs  ( ≥ 2%  of  all  subjects)  by  investigator's  causality  and  PT  in  the  safety population are provided in Table 17.

A total of 7 (26.9%) subjects in the low-dose group and 2 (10.0%) subjects in the high-dose group reported TEAEs related to the study drug among all subjects.

The most frequently reported as causal TEAEs by PT term among all subjects were nausea (3 [11.5%] subjects in low-dose and 1 [5.0%] subject in the high-dose), followed by vomiting (3 [11.5%] subjects in  low-dose  and  1  [5.0%]  subject  in  the  high-dose),  and  aspartate  aminotransferase  increased  (2 [7.7%] subjects in low-dose).

## Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by Severity

The most frequent TEAEs ( ≥ 2% of all subjects) by maximum reported intensity, SOC, and PT in the safety population are provided in Table 18.

Most of the TEAEs reported were mild or moderate in intensity. One subject each in the low-dose and high-dose groups reported any TEAEs with severe intensity.

The most frequently reported TEAEs by SOC and maximum reported intensity among all subjects were gastrointestinal disorders of mild intensity (8 [30.8%] subjects in low-dose and 9 [45.0%] subjects in high-dose) followed by general disorders and administration site conditions of mild intensity (2 [7.7%] subjects in the low-dose and 4 [20.0%] subjects in high-dose).

The most frequently reported TEAEs by PT term and maximum reported intensity among all subjects were nausea of mild intensity (5 [19.2%] subjects in the low-dose and 5 [25.0%] subjects in the highdose),  followed  by  vomiting  of  mild  intensity  (5  [19.2%]  subjects  in  the  low-dose  and  3  [15.0%] subjects  in  the  high-dose),  and  aspartate  aminotransferase  increased  of  mild  intensity  (3  [11.5%] subjects in the low-dose).

One subject in the low-dose group had severe TEAEs with SOC of psychiatric disorders and respiratory thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders;  PT  of  laryngeal  obstruction,  psychiatric  disorders;  and  PT  of withdrawal symptoms.

One  subject  in  the  high-dose  group  had  severe  TEAEs  of  SOC  Investigations  for  PT  alanine aminotransferase increased and aspartate aminotransferase increased.

## Deaths

There were no deaths reported during this study.

## Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events

During the study, SAEs were reported in 1 (3.8%) subject, in the low-dose group in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years. This subject had 2 SAEs: withdrawal syndrome and laryngeal obstruction.

Withdrawal  syndrome:  On  Day  8,  following  prolonged  analgosedation,  the  subject  experienced withdrawal syndrome (severe), which was considered an SAE. The event was considered to have been caused  by  the  following  medications:  fentanyl,  remifentanil,  propofol,  midazolam,  sevoflurane, dexmedetomidine, and ketamine. The event was considered serious for the following reasons: requires or prolongs hospitalization. The event ended on Day 20 with an outcome of recovered/resolved; the subject was discharged from hospital on the same day.

Laryngeal obstruction: On Day 4, the subject experienced laryngeal obstruction (severe), which was considered an SAE. The event was considered serious for the following reasons: life-threatening. The investigator considered the event of laryngeal obstruction to be not related to study medication. The event ended on Day 8 with an outcome of recovered/resolved.

## Discontinuations Due to Treatment-emergent Adverse Events

The only TEAE that led to discontinuation of IP during the study was liver function increased reported in 1 (5.0%) subject in the high-dose in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years.

Liver  function  increased: On Day 4, the subject experienced liver function test increased [increased LFTs] (moderate) which was considered a discontinuation of IP due to AE. The investigator considered the  AE  to  be  related  to  study  medication.  The  event  ended  on  Day  21  with  an  outcome  of recovered/resolved.

## Safety Results Summary

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· Overall, among all subjects, 21 (80.8%) subjects in the low-dose group and 14 (70.0%) subjects in the high-dose group reported any AEs. Overall, among all subjects, 19 (73.1%) subjects in the lowdose group and 13 (65.0%) subjects in the high-dose group reported any TEAEs.

·  Overall,  among  all  subjects,  a  total  of  7  (26.9%)  subjects  in  the  low-dose  group  and  2  (10.0%) subjects in the high-dose group reported TEAEs related to the study drug.

· One subject each, in the low-dose group (3.8%) and high-dose group (5.0%) reported TEAEs that were  severe  in  intensity.  One  (5.0%)  subject  in  high-dose  group,  reported  TEAEs  leading  to  study discontinuation; and 1 (3.8%) subject in the low-dose group reported SAEs during the study.

· The most frequently reported TEAE by PT among all subjects was nausea (5 [19.2%] subjects in the low-dose and 5 [25.0%] subjects in the high-dose groups), followed by vomiting (5 [19.2%] subjects in  the  low-dose  and  3  [15.0%]  subjects  in  the  high-dose  groups),  and  constipation  (3  [11.5%] subjects in the low-dose and 4 [20.0%] subjects in the high-dose groups).

- A total of 7 (26.9%) subjects in the low-dose group and 2 (10.0%) subjects in the high-dose group reported TEAEs related to the study drug among all subjects.
- Most of the TEAEs reported were mild or moderate in intensity.
- One subject each in the low-dose and high-dose groups reported any TEAEs with severe intensity.
- Only 1 subject reported any SAE in the low-dose group in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years.

## 2.3.3. Discussion and overall conclusions on clinical aspects

## Discussion

The study was an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 study to assess the PK and safety of naloxegol in pediatric patients aged ≥ 6 months to &lt;18 years receiving treatment with opioids.

A total of 57 subjects were enrolled and assigned treatment; of which, 46 subjects received treatment. Overall 33 subjects were female and 13 subjects were male in the Safety Analysis Set. The mean age was 2.8 years in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years; 9.6 years in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years; and 14.6 years in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years. The primary and secondary efficacy objectives  were  single-  and  multiple-dose  PK  results.  However,  no  multiple-dosing  analysis  was performed due to a low number of subjects.

Single-dose PK analysis was performed with the objective to evaluate the naloxegol exposures of adult equivalent 12.5 and 25 mg doses in pediatric subjects receiving opioids from ≥ 6 months to &lt;18 years of age. Naloxegol AUC and Cmax values for subjects from ≥ 6 years to &lt;18 years of age were derived by NCA. A PPK model was developed to derive the AUC and Cmax values for pediatric subjects ≥ 6 months  to  &lt;18  years  of  age.  The  noncompartmental  PK  analysis  of  the  12.5  and  25  mg  adult equivalent  doses  in  adolescent  subjects  ( ≥ 12  years  to  &lt;18  years  of  age)  revealed  comparable naloxegol exposures compared to that of adult subjects.

The AUC values for pediatric subjects ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years of age were approximately 45% lower for the  12.5  mg  (46.1  hr*ng/mL)  and  approximately  60%  lower  for  the  25  mg  (65.4  hr*ng/mL)  adult equivalent  exposures.  These  findings  were  expected,  because  body  weight  was  not  identified  as  a significant covariate in the PPK analysis, and the dose adjustment by body weight was not needed in pediatric subjects. Body weight of the subjects in this analysis ranged from 8.0 to 133.9 kg. However, CL/F and V1/F of naloxegol were found to be independent on body weight in this analysis. Based on this,  it  would  suggest  that  allometric  scaling  of  CL/F  and  V1/F  is  not  needed  to  extrapolate  the exposure of  naloxegol  pediatric  subject ≥ 6  years  to  &lt;18  years  of  age.  Although  subgroup  analysis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

indicated exposure to naloxegol in subjects with mild/moderate hepatic impairment was 41% higher than that in subjects with normal hepatic function; impaired hepatic function was not found to be a significant  factor  on  CL/F  or  V1/F  of  naloxegol.  The  BSV  of  CL/F  and  V1/F  of  naloxegol  in  the  base model was 54.5% and 66.3%, respectively. After covariate model building, the BSV of CL/F and V1/F of  naloxegol  in  the  final  model  was  50.7%  and  63.7%,  respectively.  This  suggested  the  covariate factors described approximately 4% of the variability. The BSV at this level could result in difficulty to detect significance and thus not identify impaired hepatic function, and body weight on CL/F or V1/F of naloxegol. Strong CYP3A4 inducer, moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, P-gp inhibitor and P-gp inducer were found to be significant factors on the CL/F of naloxegol in the previous PPK analysis of naloxegol in volunteer adult subjects and OIC adult patients (Al-Huniti et al 2015). These factors were not available in the pediatric patients and were not investigated in this PPK analysis. However, the estimated BSV of CL/F of naloxegol was 48% in the previous PPK analysis, which is only 3% less than the estimate in this PPK analysis.

Employing the final PPK model of naloxegol oral dose, AUC0-∞ and  Cmax of naloxegol in the three pediatric age groups, OIC adults and healthy adults were determined from Monte Carlo simulation of PK profiles after a single oral dose of 25 mg naloxegol. Model-predicted naloxegol AUC0-∞ of the three pediatric age groups was 106%, 112%, and 119% of the AUC0-∞ in OIC adults, respectively.

The other secondary analyses performed were palatability, acceptability, and clinical outcome results. For  naloxegol  liquid  oral  solution,  at  Visit  2,  in  the  low-dose  group,  mean  palatability  score  was reported as 59.6 for 5 of 9 subjects in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years, and 50.0 in the high-dose group in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years. At Visit 3, results were available only for 1 subject who scored 100 in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years in low-dose group. Regarding acceptability, all subjects in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years were able to swallow tablets on Day 1 and data were only available for 2 subjects for low-dose and 5 subjects for high-dose on Day 2 (who were also able to swallow tablets). The number of subjects with the ability to swallow the oral solution was too small to draw conclusions (1 [16.7%] subject).

The median time (95% CI) to first BMs was 16 hours in the low-dose group in the ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years age group, 63 hours for both low-dose and high-dose groups in the ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years age group,  and  110  hours  and  103  hours  for  low-dose  and  high-dose  groups,  respectively,  in  the ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years age group. The mean number of days with a BM per week was 5 days for subjects in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years, 4.12 days for subjects in the low-dose group and 5.31 days in the high-dose group in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years, and 2.18 days for subjects in the lowdose groups and 1.81 days in the high-dose group in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years. The mean number of days with laxative use per week was 0.71 days for subjects in the low-dose group and 2.8 days in the high-dose group in the age group ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years, and 3.87 days for subjects in the low-dose group and 2.49 days in the high-dose group in the age group ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years. No subjects in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years (low-dose group) used any laxative.

Thirty-two subjects experienced TEAEs, and the most commonly reported TEAE was nausea. Overall, among all subjects, 19 (73.1%) subjects in the low-dose group and 13 (65.0%) subjects in the highdose group reported any TEAEs. Of these, a total of 7 (26.9%) subjects in the low-dose group and 2 (10.0%) subjects in the high-dose group reported TEAEs related to the study drug. One subject each, in  the  low-dose  group  (3.8%)  and  high-dose  group  (5.0%)  reported  TEAEs  that  were  severe  in intensity. One (5.0%) subject in the high-dose group, reported a TEAE leading to study discontinuation; and 1 (3.8%) subject in the low-dose group reported SAEs during the study.

## Overall Conclusions

- Naloxegol exhibits dose-linear PK using both NCA and PPK over the dose range of 5 to 25 mg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The NCA- and PPK-derived naloxegol drug exposures in pediatrics subjects ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years of age that received either the 12.5 or 25 mg adult equivalent dose were lower than the OIC adult exposures. It is unclear why the observation of lower exposure with the 12.5 mg dose was not taken into account when the 25 mg equivalent dose was determined.
- The PPK model-derived naloxegol drug exposures in pediatric subjects 6 months to &lt; 6 years of age that received the adult 12.5 mg equivalent dose were lower than the adult exposures.
- Naloxegol NCA- and PPK-derived drug exposures that were normalized to a fixed dose in the 2 pediatric  age  groups  ( ≥ 6  years  to  &lt;12  years,  and ≥ 12  years  to  &lt;18  years  of  age)  were consistent to adults exposures. This conclusion is less clear based on PK parameters calculated by NCA.
- Monte Carlo simulations of the PPK model predicted that following administration of naloxegol 25  mg  in  pediatric  subjects  6  months  to  &lt;  6  years  of  age  naloxegol  exposures  would  be comparable to those following administration of naloxegol 25 mg to adults.
- The palatability and acceptability data were insufficient to draw any conclusions.
- No fatal events were reported. Naloxegol was well-tolerated, and no new safety findings were observed.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The PK parameters of naloxegol in pediatrics were derived by NCA (subjects ≥ 6 years to &lt;18 years) and popPK analysis (subjects ≥ 6 months to &lt;18 years). For subjects 6 months to &lt; 12 years that received the 12.5 mg adult equivalent dose, drug exposure was lower compared to that of adults. It should be clarified why the exposure observed in the lower dose cohort was not taken into account when determining the 25 mg equivalent dose.

Conclusions on comparable naloxegol exposure in the three pediatric age groups, OIC adults and healthy adults following administration of a fixed 25 mg naloxegol dose are based on Monte Carlo simulations of the popPK model. An in-depth assessment of the model building, evaluation and simulations performed will be conducted at the time of submission of the planned type II variation. At present, no modifications to the SmPC are proposed.

The palatability and acceptability data were insufficient to draw relevant conclusions. Safety data are in line with current clinical experience with Moventig in adults (refer to Moventig SmPC). A clarification on the  low  number  of  patients  in  the  lowest  age  group  that  actually  received  naloxegol  treatment  is requested (refer to the RfSI).

## Not fulfilled:

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide additional clarifications as part of this procedure. (see section 'Request for supplementary information')

## 4. Request for supplementary information

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure:

*Although 12 patients have been recruited in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years, only 50% of them received the actual treatment resulting in 6 patients receiving low dose treatment in cohort 1. The MAH

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

is requested to discuss the reasons why such a high percentage of patients in this age group eventually did not receive the assigned treatment.

*According to the protocol, the 12.5 mg equivalent doses in the various age groups were based on PBPK modeling and projected to provide similar exposure to that achieved in adults at 12.5mg. For the ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 year pediatric age group, however, lower naloxegol exposure was observed compared to  adults.  The  protocol  further  defines  that  for  the  higher  dose  (25  mg  equivalent),  the  exposure observed in the previous (lower) dose will be taken into account. However, it seem like this was not the case as exposure for the ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 year pediatric age group receiving the 25 mg equivalent dose is even lower (39% of AUC in adults). The MAH is asked to clarify.

## MAH responses to Request for supplementary information

## Question 1

Although 12 patients have been recruited in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years, only 50% of them received the actual treatment resulting in 6 patients receiving low dose treatment in cohort 1. The MAH is requested to discuss the reasons why such a high percentage of patients in this age group eventually did not receive the assigned treatment.

## Summary of the Applicant's Response

Study  D3820C00016 was an open-label, phase I, multicentre study to assess  the  PK  and  safety  of naloxegol in  paediatric  patients  aged ≥ 6  months to &lt;18 years receiving treatment with opioids and presenting with opioid-induced constipation (OIC) or at risk of OIC. The study comprised 3 different age groups proceeding sequentially from the oldest to the youngest age group, and each age group comprised 2 cohorts.

Per protocol, cohort 5 was to enrol at least 4 patients in the age group ≥ 6 months to &lt;6 years who were administered a dose of naloxegol equivalent to 12.5 mg of the adult dose.

Twelve  patients  were  recruited  in  Cohort  5;  however,  six  patients  discontinued  prior  to  receiving naloxegol treatment for the reasons summarised in the Table below:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Table: Cohort 5 Discontinued Subjects

| Subject ID   | Age/Sex/Race   | Date of Discontinuation   | Treatment Received   | Main Reason for Discontinuation                               |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|              | 4Y/F/White     | 16/Nov/2017               | No                   | Withdrawal by parent/guardian and subject decision            |
|              | 3Y/M/White     | 08/Feb/2019               | No                   | Withdrawnfrom study due to severe non-compliance to protocol* |
|              | -/F/-          | 04/Sep/2018               | No                   | Other: Unable to draw blood                                   |
|              | 2Y/M/White     | 23/0ct/2020               | No                   | Withdrawn from study due to subject decision                  |
|              | 9M/F/Other     | 17/Dec/2020               | No                   | Study specific withdrawal criteria: not able to perform ECG   |
|              | 13M/M/White    | 26/Jan/2021               | No                   | Eligibility criteria not met: concomitant use of methadone    |

*Visit 1/Enrolment/Screening, date 07/Feb/2019: ECG: Test not performed, patient was non-compliant with test (3 attempts were made)

As  illustrated  above,  the  main  reasons  for  patients'  discontinuation  in  this  cohort  were  either parent/guardian's  decision  (2  patients)  or  protocol  non-compliance  (4  patients).  It  should  be  noted that cohort 5 enrolled patients in the youngest age group. In addition, patients were assigned a study number  and  treatment  allocation  on  screening;  however,  if  important  protocol-required  pre-study activities were not performed or if the parent/guardian decided to withdraw consent between screening and randomisation, patients were discontinued from the study prior to receiving treatment, in line with Section 3.6 of the study protocol.

The  MAH  believes  the  high  percentage  of  patients  discontinuing  prior  to  receiving  the  assigned naloxegol treatment in this cohort was incidental.

## Assessment of the Applicant's Response

In the youngest age group, half of the 12 patients recruited eventually did not receive the assigned treatment because of parent/guardian's decision or protocol non-compliance. The MAH considers the high number of patients discontinuing early to be incidental. As the total number of patients recruited, 12,  is  low,  the  high  discontinuation  rate  indeed  might  very  well  be  a  chance  event,  and  does  not appear to be related to the foreseen treatment.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Question 2

According to the protocol, the 12.5 mg equivalent doses in the various age groups were based on PBPK modeling and projected to provide similar exposure to that achieved in adults at 12.5mg. For the ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 year pediatric age group, however, lower naloxegol exposure was observed compared to adults.  The  protocol  further  defines  that  for  the  higher  dose  (25  mg  equivalent),  the  exposure observed in the previous (lower) dose will be taken into account. However, it seem like this was not the case as exposure for the ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 year pediatric age group receiving the 25 mg equivalent dose is even lower (39% of AUC in adults). The MAH is asked to clarify.

## Summary of the Applicant's Response

It is the MAH's position that the protocol-specified processes for determining the adult equivalent 25 mg naloxegol for the ≥ 6 to &lt; 12 years of age group (cohort 4), were followed. The D3820C00016 protocol specified that the first cohort in each age group would receive naloxegol doses targeted to achieve similar exposures to adults dosed at 12.5 mg, based on physiological based pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling and allometric scaling. The second cohort in each age group would receive a naloxegol dose targeted to achieve similar exposure to the adult equivalent 25 mg dose based on the (PK) results from the naloxegol adult equivalent 12.5 mg cohort. The naloxegol dose regimens for cohorts receiving the adult equivalent 25 mg dose were determined upon review of the PK and safety data by the Safety and Pharmacokinetic Review Committee (SPRC). The minutes from the SPRC meeting that reviewed the safety and PK results from ≥ 6 to &lt; 12 years of age cohort (cohort 3), receiving the adult equivalent 12.5 mg dose of naloxegol are attached. Pharmacokinetic data from 9 subjects enrolled in cohort 3 and cohorts 1 and 2 ( ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years of age receiving the adult equivalent 12.5 and 25 mg dose of naloxegol, respectively), were summarized in the PK Summary Document (attached) that was provided to the SPRC. The SPRC minutes state that the committee unanimously approved enrolling into the ≥ 6 to &lt; 12 years of age cohort targeted to receive the adult equivalent 25 mg dose of naloxegol (cohort 4). The SPRC also agreed that based on review of the PK data of cohorts 1, 2 and cohort 3, the naloxegol dose for cohort 4 ( ≥ 6 to &lt;12 year of age) should be double the ≥ 6 to &lt; 12 year cohort receiving the adult equivalent 12.5 mg as follows:

&gt;35 kg = 12.5 mg 25-35 kg= 7.5 mg &lt;25 kg= 5 mg

The MAH therefore believes that all protocol-specified processes were followed.

## Assessment of the Applicant's Response

The Applicant submitted the SPRC meeting minutes in which it is documented that the committee agreed, based on the PK data, that the starting dose for the high dose group (adult equivalent 25 mg dose) should be double the dose used in the low group (adult equivalent 12.5 mg dose). Even though it is not fully understood why no alternative dose adaptations were considered, given the markedly lower exposure in the ≥ 6 to &lt; 12 years age cohort compared to adults for the low dose group, the review and acceptance of the proposed dose is ultimately the responsibility of the SPRC as stated in the protocol.

Issue resolved.

## Fulfilled:

The  applicant  has  presented  study  D3820C00016  (SAFARI)  completed.  This  study  was  part  of  the agreed PIP (EMEA-001146-PIP01-11). A request for supplementary information was brought forward, to enable a full assessment of the context of the post approval measure. In general, the PK findings in the paediatric population were expected. Safety data are in line with current clinical experience with Moventig  in  adults.  An  in-depth  assessment  of  the  model  building,  evaluation  and  simulations performed will be conducted at the time of submission of the planned type II variation.

No changes proposed to be made to the PI was agreed by the CHMP. The MAH intends to submit a variation application to include the data from the SAFARI study to the relevant sections of the SmPC after approval of a type II variation submitted in October 2022.
