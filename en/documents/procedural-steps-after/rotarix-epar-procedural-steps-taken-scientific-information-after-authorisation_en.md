| II/0086   | Submission of the final report of study EPI-ROTA-052 BOD EU SUPP (201433) in which the strain surveillance data of the European Rotavirus Network (EuroRotaNet) during the rotavirus seasons from September 2006 to August 2015 is presented. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | 15/12/2016 | n/a | The EuroRotaNet study does not provide evidence that rotavirus vaccination programmes are driving the emergence of vaccine escape strains that reverted to virulence. This conclusion should be taken with precaution because of the different limitations of the network, which is a good tool for overall surveillance of the main rotavirus types circulating throughout Europe, but which is not a suitable tool for detection of breakthrough disease or rare strains. The results of this study do not modify the benefit- risk balance of Rotarix, which remains positive. |

These data strengthen the existing evidence base that suggests a small increased risk of intussusception shortly after vaccination with Rotarix and Rotateq. A statement regarding any difference in risk between the two vaccines cannot, however, be made. Given that the vaccine attributable risk of intussusception remains small, the CHMP recommended that the balance of benefits and risks rotavirus vaccines remains favourable and requested the MAH that the SmPC should be updated to reflect that • Rotavirus vaccines carry an increased risk of intussusception, mostly within 7 days of vaccination. Up to 6 additional cases per 100,000 infants have been observed in the US and Australia against a background incidence of 33 to 101 per 100,000 infants (less than one year of age) per year, respectively. There is limited evidence of a smaller increased risk following the second dose. It remains unclear whether rotavirus vaccines affect the overall incidence of intussusception based on longer periods of follow up. • As a precaution, healthcare professionals should follow-up on any symptoms indicative of intussusception |

| II/0047   | To update section 5.1 'Pharmacodynamic properties' of the SmPC to include recently published real-world effectiveness and impact study data on the administration of Rotarix in different regions of the world, including Europe, Australia, Southeast Asia and Latin America in terms of protection against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis, hospitalisation rate and mortality. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 9.

The data confirm that Rotarix protects in a real-life setting against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (RV GE), including RV GE caused by G2P[4], but also highlight the potential for Rotarix to significantly reduce morbidity due to RV GE in children living in high and middle-income countries. Data on impact of Rotarix on public health impact of RV and all-cause GE- related mortality has also been reflected in the SmPC within this procedure. |

Given the remaining questions regarding the risk of intussusception (IS) following administration of Rotarix, the regulatory authorities should be kept updated of the results of the ongoing post-authorisation safety studies to further study IS, as well as analyses of spontaneously reported IS cases. The CHMP considers that more safety experience needs to be gained about IS and recommended that the MAH should continue to submit yearly PSURs. Therefore, based on the safety profile of Rotarix, which requires the submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional renewal application in 5 years time.   |

| II/0020 | Update of sections 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions for use) and 4.8 (Undesirable effects) of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to include reactogenicity and safety data from a pooled analysis of clinical trials conducted with either the lyophilised or the liquid formulation of Rotarix and post marketing data from both formulations. In addition to these changes, the MAH took the opportunity to add a reference to the European Medicines Agency Website in line with the latest QRD Template and to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet (PL). Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet | 18/02/2010 | 30/03/2010 | SmPC and PL | This variation based on pooled results from data acquired either during the course of clinical studies available since the vaccine registration in Europe or through post- marketing surveillance (PMS). A review of in total 23 completed clinical trials breaking down into 20 placebo- controlled and 3 non-placebo-controlled studies found additional previously unlisted adverse event (haematochezia) and that several frequency statements for listed adverse events needed to be revised. In addition, the PI was updated with information on cases of intussusception reported in temporal association with Rotarix in post-marketing experience. Most cases were reported within seven days following the first dose, however a clear causal relationship could not be established. Nevertheless, as a precaution, healthcare professionals should follow-up on any symptoms indicative |

Parents/guardians should be advised to promptly report such symptoms. Furthermore, a number of adverse events currently listed under section 4.8 of the SPC have been removed, as they are not considered to be plausibly causally related to Rotarix vaccination: upper respiratory tract infection, irritability, crying, sleep disorder, somnolence, hoarseness, rhinorrhoea, loss of appetite, vomiting, constipation, rash, muscle cramp, fever and fatigue. It could be demonstrated that there was no significant difference between the placebo and Rotarix groups concerning events which are considered related to rotavirus infection (fever, vomiting, irritability, loss of appetite). The PI was updated to reflect these findings.   |

The PL was updated accordingly. In addition, sections 6.3 and 6.4 of the SPC were updated in line with the SPC Guideline and current guidance documents on storage conditions and to update the contact details for Cyprus and Slovenia in the list of local representatives in the PL. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   |            |            |             | Rotarix given concomitantly with routine WHO Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines including Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (according to WHO classification ) HIV positive infants in South Africa. The results suggested that 3 doses of Rotarix given concomitantly with routine childhood vaccines are as safe as 3 doses of placebo in HIV infected infants. The data obtained was considered sufficient to support the deletion of a contraindication for HIV positive subjects of the SPC and substituting this with a wording in section 4.4. The PL was updated accordingly to reflect the safety and immunogenicity changes of the SPC.   |

To fulfil this commitment, study Rota-054 was conducted in 4 European countries to assess Rotarix safety when given to pre-term infants concomitantly with routine childhood vaccines. The efficacy and safety results from study Rota-054 showed that two doses of Rotarix may be given concomitantly with routine childhood vaccines in pre-term born at 27 to 36 weeks of gestation.                       |

The immunogenicity of childhood vaccinations was also evaluated to explore any effect of co-administration with the HRV vaccine. The efficacy results showed that sufficient protection against gastroenteritis caused by the serotypes G1P 8 , G2P 4 , G3P 8 , G4P 8 and G9P 8 continues in the second |

| II/0005 | Further to the review of the reports from post- marketing data the product information for Rotarix is updated to minimise the risk of maladministration. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet | 18/10/2006 | 11/12/2006 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | Following the review of all reports of parenteral administration of the oral vaccine Rotarix, the SPC, PL and labelling were updated in the view to minimise the risk of maladministration: For this purpose the term \"vial\" was replaced by \"glass container\", and the term \"syringe\" by \"oral applicator\". The pictograms have also been changed in order to make clear that the vaccine is for oral use. Furthermore, the term \"oral\" and the sentences \"Do not inject\" and \"Rotarix should under no circumstances be injected\" are highlighted in bold. |
