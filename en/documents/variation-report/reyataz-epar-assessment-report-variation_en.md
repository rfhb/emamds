## Introduction

On April 2013, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Reyataz (AI424397 - PRINCE 1 study), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. It could be noted that PK data will be analysed in a separate pharmacokinetic (PK) report after completion of the other paediatric study (AI424451 - PRINCE 2 study).

These data are planned to be submitted as part of the submission of the type II variation for the paediatric extension of indication and the oral powder line extension.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## Scientific discussion

## Information on the development program

The MAH stated that PRINCE 1 study is part of a clinical development program. The extension application consisting of the full relevant data package ( i.e containing several studies) is expected to be submitted by July 2015 . A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed.

## Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Reyataz is currently available in hard capsule of 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg. Additionally, a more convenient age-appropriate oral powder formulation was developed . Safety, PK and optimal dose of atazanavir (ATV) powder was assessed in the dose-finding study PACTG 1020-A (AI424020) in 182 paediatric subjects aged 91 days to 21 years. A population modelling and simulation study based upon the observed data from study PACTG 1020-A resulted in proposed recommended doses that are expected to achieve exposures considered close to that of adults, and therefore, to be sufficient for efficacy.

## Clinical aspects

## 1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for study AI424397 (PRINCE 1). However, as previously stated PK data were not provided in this report and will be analysed in combination with PRINCE 1I study PK data in a separate report.

## 2. Clinical study

Title: AI424397 - PRINCE 1 is a Prospective Single Arm, Open-label, International, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of Atazanavir (ATV) Powder Boosted with Ritonavir (RTV) Liquid with an Optimized NRTI Background Therapy, in HIV Infected Pediatric Patients greater than or equal to 3 months to less than 6 Years.

## Description

The primary purpose of study AI424397 is to confirm that the proposed dose of ATV powder formulation with RTV in optimized regimens given in infants and children 3 months to &lt; 6 years of age

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

are safe and well tolerated and produce systemic exposures comparable to those seen in adults treated with the once daily (QD) dose of ATV 300 mg boosted with RTV 100 mg.

This study was conducted in 18 sites in Brazil (1), Chile (2), Mexico (6), Peru (2), South Africa (5) and Thailand (2).

This clinical study report summarizes the results of the Week 48 analyses, and includes cumulative safety data through the database lock date of 03-Dec-2012.

## Methods

## · Objectives

Primary objective: to describe the safety of ATV powder formulation boosted with RTV liquid-based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens in pediatric subjects dosed through 48 weeks (or a minimum of 24 weeks for subjects who are 5.5 years of age at the time of study start), including deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), and discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs).

## Secondary objectives:

- to describe efficacy as measured by proportion of subjects with a virologic response as defined by an undetectable HIV RNA levels &lt; 50 copies/mL and &lt; 400 copies/mL by Roche Amplicor HIV-1 RNA Assay (version 1.5) through Week 48 of ATV powder formulation.

- to describe the PK profile of ATV powder formulation with RTV in pediatric subjects in terms of ATV maximum concentration (Cmax), minimum concentration (Cmin), and area under the concentrationtime curve (AUC).

In addition, a non-protocol exploratory objective of this report was to evaluate the PK profile of a subset of subjects ≥ 3 months to &lt; 6 months of age administered 150 mg ATV powder + 80 mg RTV oral solution.

- Study design

This study is a Phase 3b prospective, international, multicenter, open-label, non randomized , 2stage study of a cohort of HIV-infected pediatric subjects ≥ 3 months to &lt; 5 years and 6 months of age , treated with ATV powder and RTV optimized regimens. Subjects can be ARV naive or experienced (without prior exposure to ATV). Subjects exposed to ARVs in utero or intra-partum may be included in the study but will be considered 'treatment naïve'.

ATV/RTV is combined with a nucleoside backbone therapy selected by the investigator and consisted in 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTIs) approved for pediatric use and dosed as per the local country label ( tenofovir [TDF] is excluded ).

The study was divided into 2 stages. At Stage 1, all subjects received ATV/RTV with ATV powder formulation up to 48 weeks. Subjects completing stage 1 or subjects achieving 6 years old and/or a weight ≥ 25 kg during Stage 1 enter into Stage 2 with the appropriate ATV formulation.

The ATV powder was to be mixed with a small amount of food or beverage (if water was used, the mixture must have been taken with food). The entire contents of the mixture must have been consumed to obtain the full dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Subjects achieving 6 years old or 25 kg switched to ATV capsules.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

Safety: Frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (clinical and laboratory) and discontinuations from study due to AEs through Week 48. AEs, laboratory abnormalities and ECG parameters were notified. Efficacy: Proportion of subjects with HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/mL and &lt; 400 c/mL through Week 48; HIV RNA log10, CD4 cell counts and percents observed values and changes from baseline through Week 48; Viral genotypic and phenotypic resistance profiles. PK: Cmax, AUC(TAU), Cmin, CLT/F, and CLT/F/kg of both ATV and RTV at Week 2.

## · Statistical Methods

Sample size/Power: Sample size was not based on power calculations. Approximately 50 subjects distributed among the 3 weight bands were planned for this study, with a minimum number of 4, 10 and 10 subjects respectively in the weight groups 5-&lt;10 kg, 10-&lt;15 kg and 15-&lt;25 kg. A target sample size of 50 treated subjects can detect with 80% probability a safety event that occurs at a per subject incident rate of 3.2%, and can produce an exact binomial 95% CI within ± 14% for a response rate of 50%.

Efficacy: Response rates were assessed with the Snapshot algorithm using an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set. HIV RNA log10, CD4 cell counts and percents observed values and changes from baseline were summarized at baseline and each analysis week on ATV powder through Week 48. CD4 cell counts and changes from baseline were also summarized using last observation carried forward (LOCF) and baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) methods on ATV powder through Week 48. For LOCF, missing values were replaced with the last on-treatment value in the previous visit window; if a subject did not have any on-treatment value, then the baseline value was carried forward. For BOCF, missing values were replaced with the baseline value. For both analyses, missing baseline values were replaced with the first on-treatment value.

Resistance: Viral genotypic and phenotypic resistance profiles were assessed for virologic failures who meet the criteria for resistance testing: less than a 1 log10 drop from baseline in HIV RNA level by Week 16, confirmed by a second HIV RNA level; or a HIV RNA level &gt; 200 copies/mL after Week 24, confirmed by a second HIV RNA level; or repeated HIV RNA level ≥ 50 copies/mL after Week 48; or a HIV RNA level ≥ 400 copies/mL confirmed by a second HIV RNA level of ≥ 400 copies/mL at any time in a subject who had previously achieved a plasma HIV RNA level &lt; 50 copies/mL; or discontinued due to 'lack of efficacy'.

## Rapporteur's comment:

The selection of ATV dose regimen was based on a population modelling and simulation study based upon  the  observed  data  from  study  AI424020.  These  doses  are  expected  to  achieve  exposures considered close to that of adults.

Although  considered  as  secondary  endpoints,  PK  data  are  deemed  critical  besides  safety  data  and should be comparable to historical adults PK values to conclude on the adequacy of selected ATV/RTV doses.

As  the  primary  endpoint  concerns  safety  issue,  the  sample  size  was  determined  as  such  enabling detection of common AEs.

The backbone consisted in two approved NRTIs for paediatric use (excepted tenofovir), i.e. zidovudine, lamivudine, stavudine, abacavir and didanosine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of note in parallel of PRINCE 1 study, the PRINCE 2 study is currently ongoing, with similar objectives, endpoints,  investigational  product  (IP)  formulations,  background  therapy  and  study  population, excepted that children from 3 months to &lt; 7 years 6 months of age were included.

## Results

## · Recruitment/ Number analysed

Eighty-two subjects were enrolled, and 56 subjects (68%) were treated: 21 in the group 5-&lt;10 kg, 19 in the group 10-&lt;15 kg, and 16 in the group 15-&lt;25 kg. Reasons for not being treated were that the subject no longer met study criteria (23 subjects [28%]), other reason (2 subjects [2%]), and subject withdrew consent (1 subject [1%]).

Among the 56 treated subjects, 46 subjects (82%) completed the Stage 1, and 9 subjects (16%) discontinued ATV powder before Week 48. The causes of premature discontinuation were AEs (n = 5), lack of efficacy (n = 2), withdrew consent (n = 1) and subject no longer meets study criteria (n = 1). Additionally, one subject discontinued ATV powder after Stage 1 due to poor/non-compliance.

Among the 45 subjects entered Stage 2, 4 subjects were switched to ATV capsules prior to Week 48.

## Rapporteur's comment:

The  rate  of  discontinuation  at  Week  48  is  low  (16%),  especially  for  a  paediatric  population,  which suggest a good tolerance of ATV powder.

At baseline, 23 subjects (41%) had abnormal ECG findings. Overall, the most common abnormal findings were sinus tachycardia (10 subjects [18%]), other rhythm abnormalities (8 subjects [14%]), left axis deviation (7 subjects [13%]), and right axis deviation (3 subjects [5%]).

## Rapporteur's comment :

The  study's  population  is  rather  heterogeneous  with  61%  ARV  naïve  and  39%  ARV  experienced subjects.

It  could  be  noted  that  unlike  the  two  other  doses  groups,  subjects  weighing  15-&lt;25  kg  had  lower baseline HIV-1 RNA level and CD4+ cells count. As expected more children in the lowest weight band had high level of viremia.

##  NRTI background therapy

Among the 56 subjects receiving ATV powder + RTV, the NRTIs co-administered were abacavir (n = 46), lamivudine (n = 41), zidovudine (n = 21), stavudine (n = 4) and didanosine (n = 2).

##  Compliance

According to exposure data, most subjects were compliant with the dosing schedule.

## Rapporteur's comment:

It  is  difficult  to  interpret  the  compliance  data  with  mean/median  value  of  average  daily  dose.  An expression of results including percentage of subjects achieving 90% to 100%, 80% to 90%, etc… of ATV therapy would be preferable to assess compliance of this paediatric population and would better compare the compliance of subjects in each group. Moreover, the reasons of non-compliance should be explored in order to detect potential inconveniences with powder formulation.

##  Virologic response

At Week 48 on the ATV powder cohort, 74% of subjects had HIV RNA &lt; 400 c/mL and 61% of subjects had HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/mL , based on Snapshot algorithm.

Based on observed values analysis, 89% of subjects had HIV RNA &lt; 400 c/mL and 73% of subjects had HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/mL at Week 48. As observed with Snapshot algorithm, the proportion of subjects with HIV RNA &lt; 400 c/mL (94% and 86%, respectively) and &lt; 50 c/mL (75% and 72%, respectively) was similar in ARV-experienced and -naive subjects.

Rapporteur's comment

:

Efficacy results of PRINCE 1 study could be compared to the two pivotal studies (AI424-138, AI424045) in adults and a prior study in older children (PACTG 1020A):

Results in PACTG were very low in ARV experienced children 6 to 18 years of age (but finally close to those in adults). In the present study similar level of virologic suppression is observed be the children naïve or experienced, however the level of treatment experience is likely very limited in this young population not including adolescents.

When all subjects were considered a lower rate of virologic success is observed in subjects weighing 5 to 10 kg (48% and 67% had a viral load &lt; 50 c/mL and &lt; 400 c/mL, respectively, versus 70% and 79% in subjects weighing 10 to 25 kg), however, the 5-10 kg weight group (youngest children) had (as expected) higher level of viremia (85%&gt;100 000 copies/ml). Overall, these results will have to be put in perspective with the to-be-submitted PK study report.

##  HIV RNA changes from baseline

At Week 48, the overall mean (median) change from baseline in HIV RNA was -2.66 (-3.06) log10 c/mL. This value was -2.61 (-3.31), -2.93 (-3.31), and -2.40 (-2.59) log10 c/mL in the 5-&lt;10 kg, 10&lt;15 kg, and 15-&lt;25 kg groups, respectively, and was -2.90 (-3.25) log10 c/mL and -2.52 (-2.89) log10 c/mL in ARV-experienced and -naive subjects, respectively.

Rapporteur's comment:

The HIV RNA mean change from baseline is similar between the 3 weight groups.

##  CD4 cell count changes from baseline

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At Week 48, the overall mean (median) change from baseline in CD4 cell count was 397 (363) cells/mm3. This value was 550 (491), 225 (274), and 374 (363) cells/mm3 in the 5-&lt;10 kg, 10-&lt;15 kg, and 15-&lt;25 kg groups, respectively, and was 182 (213) cells/mm3 and 493 (520) cells/mm3 in ARV-experienced and -naive subjects, respectively.

##  Resistance

Through Week 48, 14 subjects met the criteria for virologic failure. Nine of these subjects had paired genotypic data (data at baseline and on treatment) and 6 had paired phenotypic resistance testing data.

None of the subjects acquired phenotypic resistance to ATV, ATV/RTV, or any NRTI or NNRTI. None of the subjects developed any major PI substitution to ATV or ATV/RTV. One ARV-naive subject in the 10&lt;15 kg weight band developed M36M/I and 1 ARV-naive subject in the 5-&lt;10 kg weight band developed H69K/R. One ARV-experienced subject in the 15-&lt;20 kg weight band developed I72I/V substitution, and 1 ARV-naive subject in the 5-&lt;10 kg weight band developed L19I/R.

## · Safety results

##  Adverse events

Through Week 48, the majority of subjects (93%) had AEs. The most common AEs were upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and vomiting. Twenty-one subjects (38%) on ATV powder had related AEs, and the most common AEs were hyperbilirubinemia and vomiting.

Eight subjects (14%) had Grade 2 - 4 related AEs, of whom 4 subjects with hyperbilirubinaemia.

## Rapporteur's comment:

The  most  common  AEs  related  to  ATV  (hyperbilirubinemia  and  vomiting)  are  similar  than  those reported in pivotal studies. No new AE is reported.

##  Serious adverse events and deaths

Through Week 48, eleven subjects (20%) had SAEs while on ATV powder.

The only SAE considered related to the study therapy by the investigators was ECG QT prolonged. No deaths were reported.

##  Adverse events leading to discontinuation

Five subjects (9%) had AEs leading to discontinuation of study therapy while on ATV powder: 4 subjects in the 5-&lt;10 kg group (respectively meningitis, pulmonary tuberculosis, increased transaminases and lymphadenitis) and one subject in the 10-&lt;15 kg group (ECG QT prolonged). These discontinuations were considered related to the study therapy by the investigators for 3 subjects (increased transaminases, lymphadenitis and ECG QT prolonged).

## Rapporteur's comment:

The higher rate of discontinuation in the 5-&lt;10 kg group is driven by infection in this more vulnerable strata.

##  Adverse events of special interest

Hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice: Seven subjects (13%) on ATV powder had hyperbilirubinemia-related events (3 subjects in the 5-&lt;10 kg group and 2 subjects each in the 10-&lt;15 kg and 15-&lt;25 kg groups). All of these events were considered related to the study therapy by the investigators.

Cardiac abnormalities: Three subjects (5%) on ATV powder had cardiac disorders (ECG abnormal and ECG QT prolonged in 1 subject each in the 10-&lt;15 kg group and first degree AV block in 1 subject in the 15-&lt;25 kg group). Two of these cardiac events were considered related to the study therapy by the investigators.

Rash: Eight subjects (14%) on ATV powder had rash events of special interest (4, 1, and 3 subjects in the 5-&lt;10 kg, 10-&lt;15 kg and 15-&lt;25 kg groups, respectively). None of these events was considered related to the study therapy by the investigators.

Renal toxicity: Two subjects (4%) on ATV powder had renal toxicity events (proteinuria in 1 subject in the 5-&lt;10 kg group and dysuria in 1 subject in the 10-&lt;15 kg group). None of these events was considered related to the study therapy by the investigators.

Lipodystrophy: None of the subjects on ATV powder had lipodystrophy-related events.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Lactic acidosis: Seven subjects (13%) had potential lactic acidosis syndrome or symptomatic hyperlactatemia events (6 in the 5-&lt;10 kg and 1 in the 10-&lt;15 kg group). None of these events was considered related to the study therapy by the investigators.

##  ECG

Through Week 48, mean heart rate decreased, PR interval increased, and QTC (Fredericia) increased in all weight bands on ATV powder. The mean changes were observed at later time points in the 5 - &lt; 10 kg group than in the other 2 weight bands.

## Rapporteur's comment:

The safety profile of ATV powder is comparable to that seen with current ATV hard capsules.

## · Pharmacokinetic results

PK data will be analysed in a separate pharmacokinetic (PK) report after completion of the other paediatric study (AI424451 - PRINCE 2 study).

## Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Overall conclusion

AI424397 - PRINCE 1 is a Phase IIIb open-label study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and PK of ATV powder associated to RTV liquid and in combination to 2 NRTIs. Subjects were ARV-naïve or experienced children 3 months to &lt; 6 years of age and were divided into three weight groups: from 5 to &lt;10 kg, from 10 to &lt;15 kg and from 15 to &lt;25 kg. Each group received a different dose of ATV powder (150 mg, 200 mg or 250 mg, respectively) plus RTV 80 mg and two NRTIs during 48 weeks.

The study's population is rather heterogeneous with 61% ARV-naïve and 39% ARV-experienced subjects, similar number of males and females, 57% of Black/African American subjects, and a wide range of children age (3 to 65 months).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is difficult to interpret the compliance data as presented in average daily dose with mean/median values. An expression of results including percentage of subjects achieving 90% to 100%, 80% to 90%, etc… of ATV therapy would be preferable to assess compliance of this paediatric population and would better compare the compliance of subjects in each group. Moreover, the reasons of noncompliance should be explored in order to detect potential inconveniences with powder formulation.

Safety data derived from this study in this young population did not raise signal towards a differential safety profile in this population as compared to adults and older children. Hyperbilirubinemia and gastrointestinal disorders are the most frequently reported AEs. Weight subgroup analyses provide higher rate of discontinuation due to AE in subjects weighing 5 to 10 kg, but partly driven by infection in this more vulnerable weight strata.

As regards efficacy data, 74% of subjects had HIV RNA &lt; 400 c/mL and 61% of subjects had HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/mL at Week 48. While results from a prior study in children (PACTG1020A) show very low virologic suppression in ARV experienced children 6 to 18 years of age, in the present study, similar level of virologic suppression (around 60% &lt;50 copies/ml) is observed be the children ARV naïve or experienced, likely translating the limited level of treatment experience in this young population not including adolescents.

When all subjects were considered, a lower rate of virologic success is observed in subjects weighing 5 to 10 kg (48% and 67% had a viral load &lt; 50 c/mL and &lt; 400 c/mL, respectively, versus 70% and 79% in subjects weighing 10 to 25 kg), however, the 5-10 kg weight group (youngest children) had (as expected) higher level of viremia (85%&gt;100 000 copies/ml).

Overall, efficacy and safety results will have to be put in perspective with the to-be-submitted PK study report. PK data are expected in order to assess PK profile of the new formulation ATV powder, and to compare results with adults historical values.

## Recommendation

- Fulfilled (clarification on compliance data could be submitted in parallel to forthcoming submissions)

In the forthcoming submission of the PK report of PRINCE 1 and PRINCE 2 study results the MAH will have to provide the presentation of the PRINCE 1 compliance data by expressing the results in percentage of subjects achieving 90% to 100%, 80% to 90%, etc… of ATV therapy received during the study. If available, the reasons of non-compliance should be provided. PK data will be put in perspective with the compliance data.
