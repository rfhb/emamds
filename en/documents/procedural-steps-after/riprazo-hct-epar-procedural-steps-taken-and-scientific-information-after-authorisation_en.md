No new unlisted event cluster was identified in the summary tabulation from the safety database search; Literature review: Major drug reference books, including Martindale (HCTZ) and Meyler's side effects (thiazide diuretics), were reviewed for unlisted adverse reactions, and bridging literature searches up to the cut-off date of 13 Apr 2010 were performed as per PSUR search criteria (publication date from the PSUR 6 cut-off date: 31 Dec 2009). As a consequence, sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated to include a new warning on the potential risk of 'acute angle-closure glaucoma' associated with the use of hydrochlorothiazide. Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to a week of treatment initiation. Untreated acute- angle closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue authorised |

Renal excretion only accounts for 0.6% of the administered dose. No adjustment of the initial dosage is required in patients with mild to severe renal impairment, however caution should be exercised in patients with severe renal impairment. The MAH has conducted a study (Study SPP100A2262) to characterize the pharmacokinetics and safety of aliskiren in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients receiving haemodialysis (HD). It is concluded that no dose adjustment is needed in patients with ESRD. A novel and important finding of the study is that aliskiren cannot be efficiently removed by HD. Based on the data of Study SPP100A2262, the MAH proposes to change the section 4.9 and 5.2 of the SmPC. |

The most frequent are osteoarthritis, gout, bursitis, infectious diseases, injury, osteomyelitis, and autoimmune diseases. However, it is also considered that hypersensitivity/allergic reactions sometimes manifest with systemic involvement including arthralgia. Joint swelling is also very commonly associated with the above mentioned joint disorders, or could be linked to peripheral oedema or to systemic manifestation of hypersensitivity reactions. This review focused on arthralgia and joint swelling cases where underlying hypersensitivity reactions likely played a role in the development of arthralgia and where both conditions could have been due to the direct effect of aliskiren. In response to the request from CHMP, MAH conducted a comprehensive review of all cases of 'Arthrlagia'. Based on this new analysis, CHMP requested the addition of the ADR 'Arthralgia' in section 4.8 of aliskiren containing product SmPCs. authorised |

Overall the results of this clinical study support the conclusion of a positive benefit/risk ratio in the use of the aliskiren+HCTZ as antihypertensive treatment of elderly and very elderly patients. However, the review of available data also suggests different response to the treatment of elderly and very elderly demonstrating no clinically meaningful additional blood pressure reduction by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the majority of elderly patients.

| WS/0167 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. This type II variation concerns an update of section 4.5 of the SPC in view of the results of study CSPP100A2112 investigating the potential interaction between aliskiren and grapefruit juice in healthy subjects. Administration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. Co- administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC and co-administration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This decrease is likely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide- Medicinal | 22/09/2011                          | 27/10/2011 product no                       | SPC                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
