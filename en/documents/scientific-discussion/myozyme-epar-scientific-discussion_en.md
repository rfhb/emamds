## 1. Introduction

Pompe disease is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by the deficiency of acid α -glucosidase (GAA), which degrades lysosomal glycogen through the hydrolysis of α -1,4-  and α -1,6-  glycosidic linkages.  Other  names  for  Pompe  disease  include  Glycogen  Storage  Disease  type  II,  Acid  Maltase Deficiency,  and  Glycogenosis  type  II.  The  disease  is  characterized  by  organelle  bound  (lysosomal) accumulation of glycogen, as opposed to the exclusively cytoplasmic accumulation of glycogen that occurs in other glycogen storage disorders.

The absence, or almost complete absence, of GAA in Pompe disease leads to the accumulation of high levels of glycogen in various tissues, particularly cardiac and skeletal muscle, as well as respiratory muscles, leading to generalised myopathy, cardiomyopathy and respiratory failure. Pompe disease can be considered as a spectrum of disease as the clinical presentation of GAA deficiency ranges from a rapidly  fatal,  usually  infantile  disease  (the  classic  infantile  form)  characterized  by  profound  muscle weakness and flaccidity (often referred to as floppy baby) and by a progressive cardiomyopathy, to a slowly  progressive  late  onset  myopathy  (juvenile  and  adult  forms)  where  involvement  of  skeletal muscles dominates the clinical picture and respiratory insufficiency is frequent. In general, there is an inverse correlation between the amount of residual GAA activity and the severity of the disease. In addition  to  the  two  forms  described  above,  a  second  milder  subtype  of  the  infantile  form  with  less severe cardiomyopathy, absence of left ventricular outflow obstruction, and traces (less than 5%) of residual  acid  maltase  activity  has  been  described;  most  of  these  children  had  longer  survival  with assisted ventilation and intubation.

Since  there  is  currently  no  authorised  medicinal  product  available  in  the  EU  for  the  treatment  of Pompe disease, palliative and supportive care provides the mainstay of management.

## About the product

Myozyme  is  a  recombinant  human  acid  alpha-glucosidase  (rhGAA;  INN:  alglucosidase  alfa) developed for an intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of both early- and late-onset Pompe disease. It is postulated that Myozyme will restore lysosomal GAA activity resulting in  stabilisation  or  restoration  of  cardiac  and  skeletal  muscle  (including  muscles  of  the  respiratory system). Infused rhGAA is only biologically active after lysosomal uptake. Myozyme is provided as a lyophilized powder for solution for injection; see 3.2. for details. The recommended dosage regimen of Myozyme is 20 mg/kg of body weight administered once every 2 weeks as an intravenous infusion.

Genzyme has been actively involved in developing an ERT for Pompe disease since 1998. During development, different sources of rhGAA have been used, and finally using the current CHO cell line and rhGAA purification process (Myozyme). Myozyme has been used in clinical trials in patients with Pompe disease since early 2003. Since this time, the safety and efficacy of Myozyme was studied in two main clinical studies in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease (&gt;6 months and ≤ 36 months of age in AGLU01702, and &lt;6 months of age in AGLU01602). In addition, Myozyme was used for the treatment of both infantile and late-onset patients via expanded access mechanisms.

This  was  a  stand-alone  application  for  a  new  active  substance,  which  will  be  subject  to  medical prescription. No scientific advice was given by the CHMP, but the applicant had met several times with Belgian and French authorities. Clinical trials were performed in children, and in a few young adults, due to the nature of the disease. An Orphan Drug Designation was granted to Myozyme on 14 February 2001; the calculated prevalence of this condition was 0.137 per 10.000 EU population.

The  applicant  submitted  an  EU-risk  management  plan  (including  parts  on  Safety  specification, Pharmacovigilance plan, Assessment of the need for risk minimisation activities).

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. Quality aspects

## Introduction

The drug Substance of Myozyme is recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA), a hydrolase that  degrades  lysosomal  glycogen  to  glucose.  This  glycoprotein  is  produced  by  recombinant  DNA technology on Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line according to a continuous harvest cell culture process. Following collection of cell culture harvests, the enzyme  is purified by several chromatographic steps.

Myozyme  is  provided  as  a  lyophilized  powder  for  solution  for  injection.  The  finished  product  is provided in a 20 mL vial containing 52.5 mg alglucosidase alfa, 210 mg mannitol, 0.5 mg polysorbate 80,  9.9  mg  sodium  phosphate  dibasic  heptahydrate  and  31.2  mg  sodium  phosphate  monobasic monohydrate.  The contents of the vial should be reconstituted with 10.3 mL Water for Injection.  The reconstituted product contains 5 mg/mL alglucosidase alfa.

Initially, Genzyme entered into partnership with Pharming N.V. (Geel, Belgium) to develop rhGAA purified  from  the  milk  of  transgenic  rabbits  (referred  to  as  Pharming  rhGAA).  In  2000,  due  to concerns over process scalability and supply issues, rhGAA was produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line by Synpac North Carolina Inc. (referred to as Synpac rhGAA). However, concerns about the scalability, productivity and culture process lead Genzyme to develop its own production process  using  an  independently  derived  CHO  cell  line  (referred  to  as  Myozyme  and  Genzyme rhGAA), which has been used in clinical trials in patients with Pompe disease since early 2003.

During early development Genzyme also manufactured preclinical and clinical trial materials at the 30L/60L  scales  using  CHO  cells  cultivated  in  microcarrier-based  continuous  perfusion  process bioreactors. The drug substance was later produced in CHO cells cultivated in a microcarrier-based continuous  perfusion  process  bioreactor,  at  two  larger  bioreactor  scales  at  different  sites:  Genzyme was requesting marketing authorization for both the 160 L and 2000 L production scales

There were major concerns with regard to the potential levels of process impurities (host cell proteins, HCP and DNA) and possible immunogenicity of CHO cell impurities for the 160L scale.

Initially, there was insufficient data to demonstrate the consistency of the 2000L process and product. However, the impurity profile of the 2000L process (process related impurities, i.e. Host Cell Proteins / DNA) seems to be improved compared to the 160L process and it was recommended to review this, once:  i)  consistency  is  demonstrated  for  the  2000L  process  and  derived  product,  ii)  lower  protein impurity  content  is  confirmed  by  appropriate  validation  and  process-specific  detection  kit  and  iii) clinical  experience  on  product  derived  from  the  2000L  process  is  acquired.  These  major  objections were  lifted  at  later  stages  of  the  review  procedure.  Only  the  2000L  process  was  recommended  for marketing authorisation.

## Active Substance

## · Manufacture

The 160 L manufacturing process was adequately validated.  In contrast, no process validation data were  available  for  the  2000  L  process  and  this  was  considered  as  a  major  objection.    During  the procedure  the  required  validation  data  have  been  provided  and  the  2000  L  scale  process  was considered satisfactory.

## · Specification

Satisfactory specifications and validation of analytical methodology have been provided for control of the  active  substance.    Each  batch  of  active  substance  is tested for identity, purity and potency. The specifications according to which the tests are performed are justified by batch data as well as data obtained for batches used in preclinical studies and clinical trials. All routine methods used as control

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

or  release  tests  of  starting  materials,  process  intermediate,  drug  product  and  stability  samples  were validated when appropriate. No compendial reference standard of rhGAA is currently available . The company has developed its own reference standards for product testing purposes.

## · Stability

Based on the stability data provided, a 4 weeks storage period for drug substance stored at 6-10°C may be recommended.

Stability  studies  demonstrate  stability  of  the  Formulated  Drug  Substance,  stored  in  stainless  steel containers during 6 months at 2 - 10°C.

## Medicinal Product

Myozyme is a sterile lyophilized dosage powder for injection after reconstitution with WFI.

Myozyme is supplied in a container closure system consisting of a 20cc Type I glass tubing vial, a siliconized  20  mm  gray  butyl  lyophilization  stopper  and  a  20  mm  six  bridge  aluminium  seal.  The nominal  content  of  the  20  cc  vial  is  50  mg  of  active  ingredient,  alglucosidase  alfa.  Prior  to lyophilization,  each  vial  is  filled  with  10.5  ml  of  a  buffered  solution  containing  5  mg/ml  drug substance.  A  0.5  ml  overfill  is  included  to  provide  a  sufficient  volume  upon  reconstitution  for withdrawal of 50 mg reconstituted Myozyme. Each vial is intended for single use administration only.

## · Pharmaceutical Development

Thermal  screening  studies  were  initially  conducted  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  buffer  species,  ionic strength,  pH,  and  pharmaceutical  excipients  on  the  solution  behaviour  of  rhGAA.    Additional buffer/pH screening studies indicated that Genzyme rhGAA would be stable at pH 6.2. Sucrose and mannitol  synergistically  contribute  to  the  stability  of  formulated  drug  substance  and  facilitate lyophilization of the drug product.

During the scale-up and optimisation of the production batches, three changes were made to the final product formulation:

- -The ionic strength of the formulated drug substance buffer was increased from 20 mM to 25 mM
- -Sucrose was removed from the formulation, which did not negatively impact the stability of the formulated  drug  substance,  the  lyophilization process, the cake  quality,  product  recovery following reconstitution and the stability of the finished product.
- -Addition of polysorbate 80 at a nominal concentration of 0.005%

The  specifications and  stability data resulting from  the development  of  the  formulation  are satisfactory.

## Manufacture of the Product

The manufacture of rhGAA Drug Product consists of three major steps:

1. rhGAA formulation
2. Filling, lyophilization and capping
3. Labelling and packaging

The rhGAA Formulated Drug Substance is aseptically processed and sterilized by filtration through a 0.22  µm  filter.  This  method  of  sterilization  is  chosen  due  to  the  inability  of  protein  products  to withstand  terminal  sterilization.  Product  is  filled  into  previously  depyrogenated  final  containers, stoppered with pre-sterilized stoppers and sealed. Sterile filtration and lyophilization of bulk rhGAA in glass vials have been validated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The rhGAA Formulated Drug Substance is not compounded with a preservative and therefore each vial is intended for single use only.

## · Product Specification

Specifications have been chosen to conform to ICH Q6B. Specification limits were developed from historical  batch  release  data,  as  well  as  stability  data,  for  Drug  Product  lots  derived  from  Drug Substance lots manufactured at three different scales (30 L/60 L, 160 L and 2000 L). These lots were used clinically, in process validation and biochemical comparability studies.

In  general  the  proposed  commercial  specification  limits  are  consistent  with  those  established  for process validations, and were developed based on Pharmacopeial requirements, targeted or theoretical values ± range, mean ± confidence limits and observed or expected stability trends.

The specifications  and  validation  of  analytical  methodology  for  control  of  the  finished  product  are considered to be satisfactory.

## · Stability of the Product

The data provided support the following:

1. An expiration date of 18 months for Myozyme when stored at 2 - 8°C
2. Storage  of  Myozyme,  reconstituted  and  diluted  for  infusion  with  0.9%  sodium  chloride, USP/EP, for up to 24 hours at 2 - 8°C

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Two proposed commercial manufacturing scales, displaying some differences, were described, i.e. the 160  L  and  2000  L  processes.    Major  objections  were  raised  regarding  the  comparability  and  the consistency of these 160 L and 2000 L processes.

Based  on  the data provided, the protein impurities could not be directly correlated to the immunogenicity of the product and it was considered that rhGAA itself may play an important role. Nevertheless protein impurities are considered qualitatively and quantitatively \"product and process specific\", and are considered as a potential risk factor that should be avoided as much as possible.

Consequently, it was stressed to the applicant that further efforts to reduce this impurity level and to tighten  the  protein  impurities  acceptance  limit  according  to  batch  results  should  be  pursued.    In addition, the high protein impurity level was brought to the attention of clinical assessors.

Process validation of the 2000 L scale manufacturing process has been completed and demonstrates acceptable consistency.

The applicant has addressed concerns regarding stability and particulates.

Five biological reagents have been used in the production of Myozyme: donor bovine serum, foetal bovine serum, porcine derived trypsine/EDTA, salmon derived protamine sulfate and salmon derived 2-deoxycytidine. Questions raised to confirm the TSE status of these materials have been satisfactorily addressed.

The viral safety of rhGAA was well addressed. The MCB, MWCB and EOP cells were assayed for adventitious  and  endogenous  agents.  No  viral  particles  were  observed  other  than  retroviral-like particles normally seen in the MCB and EOP cell types.  The starting material does not include any human material and the material of animal origin used is well characterized. Virus validation studies have been performed to meet the CPMP/BWP/268/95 guideline.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall,  the  applicant  provided  clear  and  informative  responses  to  most  issues  raised  during  the assessment of the marketing authorisation application for Myozyme and points raised in the Day 120 List of Questions.  All major objections were adequately addressed although some recommendations regarding  the  level  of  impurities  as  well  as  the  specific  protein  impurities  assay  are  maintained  as outstanding issues and commitments.

In  conclusion,  from  a  quality  perspective,  the  2000L  production  process  may  be  recommended  for approval.

## 3. Non-clinical aspects

## Pharmacology

- Primary pharmacodynamics (in vitro/in vivo)

Results  from  all  non-clinical  pharmacology  studies  of  Myozyme  suggest  effective  depletion  of glycogen when administered to an animal model of Pompe disease - acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) knockout mouse.

The time course of the disease progression in the GAA knockout mice used by the applicant shares features  with  that  of  infantile  and  late-onset  Pompe  patients;  however,  if  the  life  span  of  mice  was considered, the model resembled more closely a late in life disease progression. Despite the lack of early clinical symptoms, the applicant considered that GAA knockout mice provide a valuable tool for non-clinical studies. The mice lack GAA enzyme activity; therefore they can be used to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of GAA activity following administration of clinically relevant doses  of  Myozyme.  Moreover,  since  the  heart  and  skeletal  muscle  of  GAA  knockout  mice  contain accumulated glycogen, they can also be used to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of Myozyme administration on glycogen depletion. Nonclinical studies performed in these mice provided insight into  the  appropriate  dose  and  dosing  regimen  required  to  produce  the  desired  clinical  results.  The majority of the pharmacodynamic studies were conducted using mice less than 6 months of age which did  not  display  obvious  signs  of  muscle  weakness;  therefore,  the  ability  of  Myozyme  to  reverse  or stabilize the clinical phenotype was not assessed in these studies.

Almost  complete  depletion  of  substrate  could  be  seen  in  the  heart  following  a  single  dose  of  100 mg/kg.of Myozyme. This same efficacy was not noted in the skeletal muscles following a single 100 mg/kg  dose  which  suggested  that  multiple  dosing  intervals  may  be  necessary  to  effectively  clear substrate  in  this  tissue.  With  repeated  dosing  at  100  mg/kg  for  4  weekly  doses,  all  tissues  were effectively depleted of glycogen. Long-term efficacy was not studied at the 100 mg/kg dose, but at lower dose levels.

The most appropriate dosing interval was determined by assessing the re-accumulation of substrate over time following a single dose. The data show re-accumulation of substrate beginning &gt;21 days in the  heart  following  a  single  dose.  Based  upon  these  data,  comparative  studies  were  conducted  to examine efficacy of Myozyme administered once weekly or every other week. A dose range  of 10-40 mg/kg of Myozyme was evaluated over a period of weeks for the ability to clear substrate from target tissues (heart and skeletal muscle specifically). In general, the results showed that the total cumulative dose administered over the dosing interval showed similar reductions in glycogen in the target organs (i.e.,  20  mg/kg  weekly  was  comparable  to  40  mg/kg  every  other  week).  Additional  studies  were conducted  to  determine  if  an  initial  high  dose  of  Myozyme  could  be  administered,  followed  by repeated low doses, in order to decrease substrate more effectively. These studies were unable to show that  an  initial  high  dose  followed  by  repeated  lower  doses  was  an  effective  strategy  in  this  mouse model.

In vitro studies showed differences in affinity for the mannose- 6- phosphate receptor and uptake into Pompe  fibroblasts  between  different  sources  of  rhGAA.  However,  there  were  no  significant pharmacodynamic differences noted in glycogen depletion across any of the CHO derived rhGAAs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

evaluated in the GAA knockout mice, probably due to the complex involvement of other mechanisms in the process of uptake of rhGAA into the muscle.

A study was conducted to evaluate glycogen depletion in 3-month-old mice as compared to 12-monthold  mice.  Mice  were  treated  according  to  established  dosing  regimens  from  previous  studies. Depletion of glycogen from skeletal muscle was more efficient in 3-month-old mice when compared to  12-month-old  mice.  Furthermore,  the  tissue  distribution  of  enzyme  following  dosing  also  varied with age; with increased levels of Myozyme detected in the heart and decreased levels detected in the skeletal muscles of the 12 month old mice as compared to the 3 month old mice. Although a direct extrapolation  to  human  is  not  possible,  these  results  supported  an  early  treatment  in  the  clinical situation.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

Histamine  and  significant  IgE  and  IgG1  antibody  titers  were  consistent  with  a  hypersensitivity response  to  a  human  protein  in  knockout  mice.  Similar  findings  were  noted  in  wild  type  mice (C57Bl/6)  and  rats.  However,  in  clinical  trials,  there  was  no  correlation  between  Cross-Reacting Immunologic  Material  (CRIM)  status,  time  to  seroconversion,  magnitude  of  antibody  titer  or occurrence  of  infusion  associated  reactions  (IARs).  This  suggests  that  the  observation  of  severe hypersensitivity in rodents was not predictive of the response seen in the clinic.

## · Safety pharmacology

A study was conducted to evaluate the safety pharmacology of Myozyme in Beagle dogs after a single bolus  IV  administration.  Administration  of  Myozyme  at  1,  10,  and  100  mg/kg  did  not  show  any effects  on  general  condition,  blood  pressure,  heart  rate,  respiration  rate,  or  rectal  body  temperature. There was no indication of adverse effects on the respiratory or cardiovascular system from this study.

In order to evaluate potential effects on the cardiac conduction, the applicant initiated a new study to assess the effect of Myozyme on the cardiovascular system of the cynomolgus monkey. This study showed that no qualitative ECG abnormalities were associated with the intravenous administration of 100 mg/kg Myozyme.

No additional safety pharmacology studies were conducted with Myozyme to evaluate the effect on the central nervous system, as the protein is unlikely to cross the blood- brain barrier and therefore neurological toxicity is not expected.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Pharmacodynamics drug interaction studies were not performed.  Myozyme is a protein and is expected to be metabolically degraded through peptide hydrolysis.  Based on its expected metabolism, Myozyme is an unlikely candidate for cytochrome P450 mediated drug-drug interactions.

## Pharmacokinetics

During the development of Myozyme, changes in formulation and manufacturing scale were evaluated for comparability. In addition, pharmacokinetics were evaluated across multiple species including the GAA knockout mouse model, following single and repeat administration and at multiple dose levels. Several bioanalytical  methods were used during the development of Myozyme. All assays used for analysis were qualified and appropriate technical reports were provided.

Repeat dose pharmacokinetics were conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats as part of a 28 day subchronic toxicology study, and in Cynomolgus monkeys as part of a 6 month chronic toxicology study.

## · Absorption- Bioavailability

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

When the AUC was plotted from rat, dog and monkey against dose a linear relationship was seen across all species and doses with exposures at all doses similar. The one exception was seen in male monkeys  where  the  AUC  was  significantly  higher  than  in  female  monkeys.  This  suggested  an increased exposure in male monkeys; however  this was not correlated to any findings in histopathology or clinical pathology parameters. Additionally, these AUC differences between sexes were not noted in the rat or dog.

When  an  evaluation  was  made  across  the  species  (excluding  the  male  monkeys)  the  highest  dose administered  (100  mg/  kg)  resulted  in  an  AUC  ranging  from  176,441-276,563  µg.min/mL.  The highest dose administered in the AGLU01702 clinical study (20 mg/kg) resulted in an average AUC of 54,060 µg.min/mL (901,074 h x ng/mL). Therefore exposure achieved across multiple species was 5 times that achieved in the AGLU01702 clinical trial of Myozyme. Further calculations using relevant PK  models  to  compare  the  PK  in  monkeys  and  humans,  showed  that  the  exposure  in  non-human primates with a 200 mg/kg dose was approximately 6 times higher than a 40 mg/kg dose in humans. In the absence of clear toxic effects this safety margin was considered acceptable.

The data also showed a very good linearity across species, which allowed for a solid evaluation of safety at higher doses and an establishment of an accurate safety margin based upon exposure. The pharmacokinetic  analysis  comparing  multiple  formulations  and  scales  showed  slight  differences  in AUC on some occasions.

There  was  a  difference  observed  in  the  AUC  at  doses  of  20  mg/kg  when  the  pharmacokinetic parameters  were  compared  in  the  GAA  knockout  mouse  as  compared  to  the  normal  mouse. Comparisons showed that there was a consistently higher exposure in the knockout animal (average AUC across multiple studies of 46,607 min x µg/ mL) as compared to the normal animal. (28,982 min x µg/ mL from normal CD:1 mice). However, as the exposures determined for normal mice were at the lower  end  of  the  range  of  AUCs  determined  in  the  knockout  mice  in  different  studies,  the  use  of normal mice for the toxicology studies was considered acceptable.

## · Distribution

Biodistribution  studies  conducted  in  normal  and  knockout  mouse  and  following  administration  of different formulations and scales showed very little difference in their distribution. The majority of the material distributed to the liver with smaller amounts distributing to other organs (heart, spleen, lung and kidney). Only a small amount of material was measured in the skeletal muscles collected.

## · Metabolism (in vitro/in vivo)

There were no studies of metabolism performed with Myozyme. Myozyme is a protein and is expected to be metabolically degraded through peptide hydrolysis.

## · Excretion

There were no excretion studies with myozyme, which is acceptable for such a product.

## Toxicology

The toxicology evaluation was done in accordance with the guidance in ICH S6 and with ICH M3. The safety of Myozyme was evaluated in different normal animal species (mouse, rat, dog, monkey), at  multiple dose levels (1-200 mg/ kg;) and following acute and chronic administration. Two single dose acute toxicity studies in rats and dogs, two repeat dose subchronic toxicity studies in rats, one repeat  dose  subchronic  toxicity  study  in  mice  and  two  repeat  dose  chronic  toxicity  study  in Cynomolgus  monkeys  were  performed  to  evaluate  the  safety  of  Myozyme  administered  IV. Furthermore, 2 reproductive toxicity studies were conducted in mice to assess the effect of Myozyme on  embryo-foetal  development  and  on  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development.  All  studies  were conducted in compliance with the GLP regulations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Single dose toxicity

In the single dose acute toxicity studies in rats and dogs, Myozyme was generally well tolerated up to 100 mg/kg IV. In 2 of 6 dogs administered Myozyme at 10 mg/ kg, and 3 of 6 dogs administered Myozyme at 100 mg/ kg, tremors were observed 60 minutes post- dose.

## · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

An overview of the conducted repeat-dose toxicity studies is provided in the following table.

*AGLU01702 clinical study 20 mg/kg: AUC of 54,060 min x µ g/ mL (901,074 h x ng/ mL)

In  the  first  repeat  dose  subchronic  toxicity  study  conducted  in  rats  an  anaphylactic  response  was observed in two of 10 animals administered Myozyme at the third dose of 100 mg/kg. Animals in all dose  groups  were  then  administered  diphenhydramine  following  the  third  and  fourth  dose  of Myozyme to counteract potential anaphylactic responses. Following administration of Myozyme at 10 and 100 mg/ kg and diphenhydramine at 5 mg/ kg, some animals still demonstrated clinical responses. Decreases  in  body  weight  and  body  weight  changes  were  noted  in  males  administered  10  and  100 mg/kg of Myozyme. There were no test article-related effects on macroscopic pathology.

In a second repeat dose subchronic toxicity study in rats pronounced clinical signs consistent with a hypersensitivity  response  were  observed  in  many  animals  following  the  third  dose  of  Myozyme despite pretreatment with diphenhydramine. The majority of animals returned to normal by one hour post-  dose,  however,  two  female  animal  deaths  were  observed  within  2  hours  of  the  third  dose administration of Myozyme (one from the 10 mg/ kg group and the other from the 50 mg/ kg group). This mortality also appeared to be related to a hypersensitivity reaction to the administered protein. Based on these results, it was not possible to assign a NOEL for any of the test articles as all dose groups showed signs of a hypersensitive reaction to the respective test articles administered. From the two rat studies, it was concluded that this species appeared to be particularly sensitive to repeated administration of Myozyme.

In the study conducted using C57Bl/ 6 mice no significant clinical signs were observed. In addition, there were no biologically relevant clinical pathology findings with the exception of two female mice with  mildly  elevated  liver  enzymes.  All  microscopic  lesions  seen  were  common  in  mice  and  were considered incidental to test  article  administration.  Therefore,  based  on  these  results,  there  were  no adverse toxic results when Myozyme was administered IV for 4 weekly doses up to 100 mg/ kg in mice.

To  further  evaluate  the  dosing  intended  for  humans,  Myozyme  was  administered  by  a  6  hour  IV infusion to Cynomolgus monkeys in the chronic toxicity study. Clinical observations were unaffected by treatment. There were no observations of any tremor-like activity as had been seen in the single

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dose toxicity study in dog. No toxicologically relevant test-article related changes occurred in clinical pathology  parameters,  terminal  body  and  organ  weight  values  and  there  were  no  histopathologic findings attributable directly to the test article itself. All monkeys administered Myozyme developed circulating rhGAA-specific IgG antibodies (See below: Other toxicity studies/ Antigenicity). However, there were no signs consistent with a hypersensitivity response. Similarly,  there were no clinical  observations  associated  with  dose  administration,  no  findings  in  any  clinical  chemistry parameters and no findings noted in histopathology review of all tissues. Therefore, it is likely that those findings considered to be significant in the rat and dog may be related to the administration of a recombinant  human  protein  as  a  rapid  bolus  injection.  In  the  determination  of  the  true  NOAEL consideration must be given to the effect that administration (including dose and dosing regimen) of a recombinant  human  protein  has  on  other  species.  The  toxicokinetic  analysis  suggested  that  the systemic exposure was not compromised by the presence of circulating antibodies. In addition to the above, liver rhGAA activity levels were determined to investigate the possibility of liver accumulation over time. There was a dose response with respect to the levels of rhGAA recovered in the liver. At day 14 post- dose in the 100 mg/ kg group, the rhGAA levels declined significantly from that observed 24 hours post dose; however, levels above background were still detectable suggesting that chronic administration  may  result  in  liver  accumulation  over  time.  In  conclusion,  the  NOEL  for  Myozyme when administered as a 6-hour intravenous infusion once every other week to Cynomolgus monkeys for at least 13 treatments is &gt;100 mg/ kg/ dose.

Due to the lack of observed toxicity in Cynomolgus monkeys upon administration of up to 100 mg/kg Myozyme, a second study was initiated in which monkeys received 200 mg/kg Myozyme every other week  for 3 months. The results demonstrated that there were no treatment-related clinical observations,  laboratory  or  pathology  findings.  All  catheter  and  infusion  site-related  microscopic changes  were  considered  to  be  within  anticipated  limits  and  not  test  article-related.  All  monkeys administered  Myozyme  developed  circulating  rhGAA-specific  IgG  antibodies.  The  toxicokinetic analysis  suggested  that  the  systemic  exposure  was  not  compromised  by  the  presence  of  circulating antibodies.  The  toxicokinetic  parameters  indicated  that  sufficient  exposure  was  reached  in  the toxicology  portion  of  the  study  to  draw  conclusions  of  safety  following  repeated  administration  of Myozyme up to 200 mg/kg. Liver Myozyme activity levels were also determined: at day 22 post- dose in the 200 mg/ kg group, the Myozyme levels declined significantly from that observed 8 days post dose; however, levels above background were still detectable suggesting that chronic administration may result in liver accumulation over time. It should be noted that in both chronic toxicity studies, Myozyme  accumulation  in  the  liver  was  not  associated  with  any  adverse  clinical  pathology  or histopathology in the recovery animals.

## · Genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo (with toxicokinetics)

Studies to assess the mutagenic potential of Myozyme were not conducted. Mutagenic potential would not be anticipated with Myozyme based on the structure of the drug substance ( a recombinant human glycoprotein), its impurity profile and the excipients in the final product ( mannitol, polysorbate 80 and sodium phosphate). In addition, the range and type of genotoxicity studies routinely conducted for pharmaceuticals  are  not  applicable  to  biotechnology-  derived  pharmaceuticals  and  therefore  are generally  not  required.  This  is  also  acceptable  in  accordance  with  ICH  S6  (Preclinical  safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals).

## · Carcinogenicity (with toxicokinetics)

No carcinogenicity studies were conducted with Myozyme, although this therapeutic is intended for long-term treatment with a total exposure over a lifetime greater than 6 months.

Carcinogenic  potential  would  not  be  anticipated  with  Myozyme  based  on  the  structure  of  the  drug substance  (a  recombinant  human  glycoprotein),  its  impurity  profile,  and  the  excipients  in  the  final product (mannitol, polysorbate 80 and sodium phosphate). The biochemical properties of Myozyme are well characterized, and there are no known interactions with DNA. According to ICH S6 standard carcinogenicity studies are not required for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals except when there is  a  concern about the carcinogenic potential; the CHMP agreed that a carcinogenic potential is not suspected for Myozyme.

## · Reproductive and developmental studies

Two reproductive toxicity studies were initiated to evaluate the effects of Myozyme in mice.

The  effect  of  Myozyme  on  embryo-foetal  development  was  evaluated  in  mice.  There  were  no treatment  related  mortality  or  remarkable  clinical  observations  during  the  study.  The  mean  post implantation loss values were similar among the groups.

There were no foetal external variations. The  foetal and litter incidences of total external malformations were similar across groups. The foetal soft tissue variations noted were common for the strain  of  mouse  used.  There  was  a  slightly  increased  incidence  of  malrotated  limbs  in  high  dose fetuses.however, the biological significance of this finding is doubtful.  In conclusion, the NOEL for maternal toxicity and for embryo-foetal viability, growth and foetal development (teratogenicity) in mice  is  considered  to  be  40  mg/kg/day,  corresponding  to  exposures  similar  to  40  mg/kg/dose  in humans.

The second study evaluated the fertility and embryonic development in mice at doses of 0, 10, 20 and 40  mg/kg.  There  were  3  unscheduled  deaths  during  the  study  attributed  to  an  anaphylactic-type reaction  resulting  from  repeated  administration  of  a  recombinant  human  protein  and  not  to  direct toxicity  associated  with  the  test  article.  Treatment  had  no  effect  on  mean  body  weight  gain,  food consumption  or  on  selected  male  reproductive  organs  (testes,  seminal  vesicles,  prostate,  and epididymides).  The  estrous  cycle  was  unaffected.  A  decreased  fertility  index  was  observed  in  all groups  (including  controls).  Based  upon  these  conclusions,  a  subsequent  study  was  initiated  to investigate  the  effect  of  the  vehicle,  the  IP  administration  of  diphenhydramine  and  the  stress  of handling on female fertility. Results from this study are expected in the post authorisation phase (as a follow-up measure).

Cesarean section data from the pregnant mice were unremarkable. There were no abortions or early deliveries. All pregnant dams had litters with viable fetuses. Of the mice that were pregnant, mean preimplantation  loss  was  unaffected  by  Myozyme.  Myozyme  had  no  effect  on  embryo/  fetal  viability. However,  it  is  recommended  that  Myozyme  should  not  be  used  during  pregnancy  unless  clearly necessary  (see  SPC  4.6).  The  sperm  analysis  report  showed  a  treatment-related  reduction  in epididymal  sperm  count  in  the  mid  and  high  dose  group  and  an  increase  in  abnormal  sperm morphology in the high dose group after 9 weeks of treatment with rhGAA. The lack of correlation with pregnancy outcome could be due to the relatively short 3- to 4-week pre-treatment period of the males before mating.

No other reproductive toxicology studies were carried out. At the request of the CHMP, the applicant committed to perform an embryo-fetal study in rabbits during the post authorisation phase (as a follow-up measure).

## · Local tolerance

Local tolerance studies were not performed because Myozyme is administered by intravenous infusion following  reconstitution  and  dilution  and  does  not  include  concentrations  of  irritants  or  corrosive components that  are  likely  to  lead  to  serious  reactions  at  the  injection  site.  In  non-clinical  toxicity studies there was no evidence of injection site reactions.

## · Other toxicity studies

## Antigenicity

A secondary objective of the chronic toxicity  study  in  Cynomolgus  monkeys  was  to  determine the antibody  response  during  the  26  week  repeat  administration  study  of  Myozyme.  The  antibody response to repeat administration of Myozyme in monkeys was evaluated using an ELISA method. All monkeys administered Myozyme developed circulating rhGAA-specific IgG antibodies. Generally, the titers observed in all groups peaked at Day 85 and remained high out to Day 169. The observed antibody titers were not dose related. The toxicokinetic analysis suggested that the systemic exposure was not compromised by the presence of circulating antibodies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The presence of circulating antibodies did not appear to have an effect on the activity of Myozyme as measured  by  the  4-MUG  activity  assay.  Since  the  exposure  was  equivalent  in  the  presence  of antibodies the safety of Myozyme could be assessed in the repeat dose non-human primate study.

## Impurities

Various formulations of Myozyme were tested during the nonclinical development program. Different formulations  were  evaluated  for  their  pharmacokinetic  equivalence  and  similar  biodistribution characteristics to the formulation intended for commercialization. The formulations tested were shown to have pharmacokinetic equivalence and all ingredients in the formulation buffers are described in a recognized pharmacopoeia or equivalent.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Myozyme  does  not  contain  or  consist  of  genetically  modified  organisms  within  the  meaning  of Directive 90/220/EC.

The  active  drug  substance  of  Myozyme  is  a  recombinant  version  of  a  naturally  occurring  human enzyme,  which  would  have  the  same  metabolites  or  degradation  products  as  the  non-recombinant version.  In  addition,  the  concentration  or  distribution  of  the  substance  itself  and  therefore,  its metabolites and degradation products, would  not  alter significantly the concentration in the environment.

No  novel  excipients  are  used  in  the  formulation  of  Myozyme.  The  excipients  that  are  in  the  drug product (i.e.  mannitol,  sodium  phosphate  monobasic  monohydrate,  sodium  phosphate  dibasic heptahydrate and polysorbate 80) also do not alter significantly the concentration in the environment. Therefore a risk to the environment is not expected.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

Results of pharmacodynamic studies suggested effective depletion of glycogen when administered to an  animal  model  of  Pompe  disease  (GAA  knockout  mouse).  A  dose  range  of  10-40  mg/kg  of Myozyme was evaluated over a period of weeks for ability to clear glycogen from target tissues (heart and skeletal muscles). Histamine and significant IgG and IgG1 antibody titers were consistent with a hypersensitivity response in mice. Safety pharmacology studies showed no undesirable pharmacodynamic effects on physiological functions in relation to exposure in the therapeutic range.

The pharmacokinetic data showed a good linearity across species.

There  were  no  toxic  findings  that  were  consistent  across  all  species  tested.  The  only  finding  of significance  following  a  single  administration  was  seen  in  the  dog  study.  This  finding  consisted  of tremors seen at 10 and 100 mg/kg. This finding could not exclude a test article effect.

It is clear from the data presented that there is a consistent finding of hypersensitivity in many of the animal models evaluated. With the exception of the non-human primate study, all species administered Myozyme  showed  some  kind  of  hypersensitivity  response.  This  hypersensitivity  response  was  not included in the consideration of the NOAEL which was justified as this rodent finding did not appear to be predictive of the response seen in the clinic.

For Myozyme administered repeatedly as a slow infusion, the NOEL is &gt; 100 mg/kg. The exposure assessed at this dose level identifies a 5X safety margin over the recommended dose (20 mg/kg every other  week).  Further  calculations  using  relevant  PK  models  to  compare  the  PK  in  monkeys  and humans, showed that the exposure in non-human primates with a 200 mg/kg dose was approximately 6 times higher than a 40 mg/kg dose in humans. In the absence of clear toxic effects this safety margin was considered acceptable.

Slight  embryo-fetal  effects  were  seen  in  the  mouse  at  high  dose  (malrotated  limbs),  and  a  study  in rabbits  will  be  available  in  post-authorisation  (as  a  follow-up  measure).  Small  effects  on  male  and female fertility were also observed and the results of further investigations will be available in postauthorisation (as a follow-up measure). A warning in pregnancy is included in the SPC (4.6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies were performed, which was acceptable as no such potential is expected for this product.

No impact on the environment is expected from a protein.

## 4. Clinical aspects

## Introduction

Efficacy  of  Myozyme  in  the  treatment  of  Pompe  disease  was  studied  in  two  main  clinical  studies (AGLU01602  and  AGLU01702).  Several  other  supportive  studies  with  earlier  rhGAA  products  or data from expanded access programs, using Myozyme,, were also submitted as supportive data. All studies with Myozyme are listed in Table 2 below.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

The Applicant stated that the clinical studies were carried out according to GCP.

## Pharmacokinetics

The rhGAA in human plasma was measured using a 4-methylumbelliferylα -D-glucoside (4-MUG) substrate. This was a fluorometric assay with a lowest limit of quantification in plasma of 12.5 ng/ml.

## · Absorption and distribution

In  the  clinical  trial  (AGLU01602)  including  18  patients,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  Myozyme  were evaluated in 15 patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease (all aged less than 6 months at treatmentonset)  who  received  doses  of  20  mg/kg  or  40  mg/kg  Myozyme  as  an  approximate  4  to  6.5-hour infusion, respectively. Pharmacokinetics were dose proportional and did not change over time. After the first and sixth infusion of Myozyme, mean maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) ranged from 178.2 to 263.7 µ g/mL for the 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg dose groups respectively. The mean area under the  plasma  concentration-time  curve  (AUC ∞ )  ranged  from  977.5  to  1,872.5 µ g · hr/mL  for  the  20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg dose groups. Mean plasma clearance (CL) was 21.9 mL/h/kg and mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was 66.2 mL/kg for both dose groups with small between-subject variability of 15% and 11%, respectively. Mean plasma elimination half-life (t1/2) was 2.75 hours for the two dose groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  pharmacokinetics  of  Myozyme  were  also  evaluated  in  a  separate  trial  (AGLU01702)  in  21 patients  with  infantile-onset  Pompe  disease  (all  aged  between  6  months  and  3.5  years  at  treatmentonset) who received doses of 20 mg/kg of Myozyme. In 12 patients with available data the AUC ∞ and Cmax were approximately equivalent to those observed for the 20 mg/kg dose group in the above other main trial. The t½ of approximately 2-3 hours was also similar in this group of patients.

The pharmacokinetics of Myozyme were evaluated in a trial (AGLU02804) in 5 patients with lateonset Pompe disease aged 6-15 years who received 20 mg/kg Myozyme every 2 weeks. There was no difference in the PK profile of Myozyme in late-onset patients compared to infantile-onset patients.

## · Elimination

Excretion,  metabolism  or  genetic  polymorphism  were  not  specifically  studied.  No  studies  were performed in special populations (e.g. in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, or in relation to gender, race, weight, elderly).

## · Interactions

No pharmacokinetic interaction studies were performed.

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Mechanism of action

Pompe disease is caused by a deficiency of acid alpha glucosidase (GAA), which degrades lysosomal glycogen. Myozyme is recombinant human acid alpha-glycosidase (rhGAA). Infused rhGAA should restore lysosomal GAA activity resulting in decrease of muscle glycogen accumulation.

## · Primary pharmacology

The activity of rhGAA in tissue samples was measured using a 4-methylumbelliferylα -D-glucoside (4-MUG) substrate in a fluorometric assay. The glycogen content in tissue samples was measured both by biochemical and histomorphological determination, and in some studies, the presence of glycogen in light microscopic sections was confirmed by electron microscopy.

Quadriceps skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained and muscle glycogen content studied up until week 52 in the main studies AGLU01602 and AGLU01702. The results demonstrated that the majority of patients in both studies had either stable or decreasing muscle glycogen content at weeks 12 and 52. The  results  from  a  population  pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic  analysis  (including  data  from patients  in  study  AGLU01602  and  AGLU01702)  demonstrated  a  significant  correlation  between Myozyme plasma AUC and change in biochemical glycogen content of muscle biopsies (Spearman's r: -0.48, p = 0.0075) and between dose and change in GAA activity (Spearman's r: 0.67, p &lt; 0.0001) after 12 weeks treatment. However, the change in muscle glycogen content at weeks 12 and 52 was not  entirely  predictive  of  clinical  motor  response  at  week  26  in  AGLU01602  and  at  week  52  in AGLU01702.

## · Secondary pharmacology

No secondary pharmacology studies were performed. No pharmacodynamic interaction studies were performed.

## Clinical efficacy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The studies on clinical efficacy are presented below  in the following order: 1) Epidemiological study of  the  natural  history  of  infantile  Pompe  disease,  2)  Studies  in  patients  with  infantile-onset  Pompe disease and 3) Studies in patients with late-onset Pompe disease.

## Epidemiological study of the natural history of infantile Pompe disease

- Selection of historical control groups: Epidemiological study of the natural history of infantile Pompe disease (Study AGLU-004-00)

This was a multinational, multicentre (32 sites from 9 countries, including one center in Austria, Italy, France,  UK,  and  NL),  historical  cohort  study  to  characterise  the  natural  disease  progression  in untreated patients diagnosed with infantile Pompe disease. Historical data were retrieved retrospectively from patients medical records and transcribed onto Case Report Forms. The first data abstraction  visit  or  baseline  visit  was  followed  by  quarterly  follow-up  visits  for  living  patients  to assess the time course of the natural history of the disease. Information was collected from both living and deceased patients.

## METHODS

## Study participants

Medical records were collected from all patients with clinical diagnosis of infantile Pompe disease as defined by documented GAA-enzyme deficiency or GAA gene mutation and onset of symptoms by 12 months of age corrected for gestation if necessary. The protocol was revised in 2001 at the FDA's request to collect as many records as possible, and include data from all infantile patients, regardless of the phenotype, classical or non-typical. The patients who had been administered ERT with GAA from any source were excluded.

## Objectives

The  primary  study  objectives  were  to  1)  characterise  the  natural  history  of  disease  progression  in untreated infantile Pompe disease, and identify prognostic factors of improved survival to distinguish between  classical  and  non-classical  form  of  infantile  disease,  and  2)  to  collect  data  to  serve  as historical control in other clinical studies of efficacy, where appropriate.

## Outcomes/ endpoints

Primary endpoints were the % of patients alive and ventilator-free at 12 months from birth, from the date of onset of first symptoms, and from the diagnosis date.

Secondary endpoints included:

- -overall ventilator-free survival
- -time to death or to first ventilator dependence from birth, from first symptoms and from diagnosis.
- -physical growth assessment based on evolution of weight, length and head circumference at birth and at the most recent assessment
- -developmental assessment
- -assessment  of  cardiomegaly  and/or  cardiomyopathy,  echocardiogram  and  electrocardiogram results
- -gastrointestinal symptoms and related age at first episode
- -respiratory assessment

Follow-up: All patients living at the time of entry in the study were to be followed up quarterly until one of the following events occurred: death, patient received ERT with GAA, or  study termination.

## Statistical analyses

All statistical comparisons were conducted as two-sided tests. Time to event outcomes were analysed using  Kaplan-Meier  method.  A  stepwise  model  regression  was  used  to  identify  the  most  important prognosis variables with regard to the occurrence of an event (death and/or ventilation). Relative risks of an event and corresponding 95% CI were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression models.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Log-rank  tests  were  used  to  test  the  difference  in  survival  distributions  whether  cardiomegaly  was present ≤ 6 months of age or not. In the analysis of multiple recurrences of ventilation episodes, the marginal analysis approach of Wei, Lin and Weissfeld (WLW analysis) was used. t-tests or Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were used to analyse differences in non-censored continuous variable, e.g. number of hospitalisations  or  of  pneumonias,  between  2  groups  of  patients  differing  by  a  specific  potential prognosis factor.

## RESULTS

300 patients who presented with signs and symptoms of Pompe disease within their first year of life were screened. 168 (83 males and 85 females) were eligible and analysed. The median patient age was 2.0 months at first symptoms (n = 166; range: 0-12 months), 4.7 months at confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease (n = 165; range: prenatal to 84.2 months), 5.9 months at first ventilator support (n = 49; range:  0.1-39.1  months),  and  8.7  months  of  age  at  death  (n  =  163;  95%  CI  8.2-9.4  months).  The Kaplan-Meier survival rates at 12 and 18 months of age were 25.7% and 14.4%, respectively, while ventilator-free  survival  rates  at  12  and  18  months  of  age  were  16.9%  and  8.5%,  respectively. Cardiomegaly  (92%),  hypotonia  (88%),  cardiomyopathy  (88%),  respiratory  distress  (78%),  muscle weakness  (63%),  feeding  difficulties  (57%),  and  failure  to  thrive  (53%)  were  the  most  frequent presenting  signs  and  symptoms  of  the  disease.  Each  was  first  noticed  after  a  median  age  of approximately 4 months.

These data indicated that patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease present early with a wide array of signs and symptoms suggestive of multi-organ involvement. Patients were treated aggressively with 95.8%  of  patients receiving at least one palliative therapeutic intervention,  most  commonly symptomatic drug therapy with cardiac medications and/or antibiotics. Nutritional support and other modalities including respiratory and physical therapy, were also commonly used. 93.5% of patients required  hospitalization.  It  was  not  possible  to  readily  distinguish  classical  from  atypical  Pompe disease in this study, supporting the hypothesis that infantile-onset Pompe disease exists as a spectrum of  disease.  However,  the  data  supported  the  concept  that  patients  with  the  most  severe  form  of infantile-onset Pompe disease are likely to present with clinically important signs and symptoms of the disease within the first 6 months of life and are at greater risk of dying at earlier ages than those who present with symptoms after 6 months of age.

On  analysis  with  multiple  covariates,  early  age  at  first  symptoms  and  early  age  at  diagnosis  were associated with a significantly increased risk of death. Also, a younger median age at death was noted for  patients  born  1985-1989  and  1990-1994,  which  could  reflect  advances  with  time  in  the management of critically ill patients with life-threatening conditions such as congestive heart failure and respiratory distress. This was further confirmed by the results of an univariate analysis for the risk of death, indicating a statistically significantly lower risk of death for patients with a year of birth &gt; 1995, when compared to those born &lt; 1955 (RR 0.71, p=0.042).

## Studies in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease

## · Main studies

A Randomized, Open-Label, Multicenter, Multinational, Dose-Ranging Study of the Safety, Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Recombinant Human Acid alpha- Glucosidase (rhGAA) Treatment in Patients &lt; 6 Months Old with Infantile-Onset Pompe Disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type II)  (AGLU01602; 26-Week interim report; including survival data up to 18 months of age)

## METHODS

## Objectives and study design

AGLU 1602 was an on-going phase II/III uncontrolled multicentre multinational (3 centres in the US, 1  in  the  UK,  1  in  France,  1  in  Israel  and  1  in  Taiwan)  randomised  study  of  the  safety,  efficacy, pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  of  2  doses  of  Myozyme  (20  and  40  mg/kg/qow  =  every other  week)  during  52  weeks  in  the  treatment  18  infantile-onset  Pompe  disease  patients  aged ≤ 6 months.  Upon  completion,  patients  could  be  eligible  for  an  open-label  extension  (AGLU02403)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

provided no safety concern had emerged. An interim analysis of data obtained in the 18 patients after a first  6-month  treatment  period  was  planned  and  results  presented  in  the  marketing  authorisation application. Survival data were presented up to 18 months of age.

## Study participants

## The main inclusion criteria were:

-Patients aged ≤ 26 weeks adjusted for gestation at the time of the first dose of rhGAA.

-Clinical  diagnosis  of  infantile  Pompe  disease  as  defined  by  both  documented  clinical  symptoms compatible  with  Pompe  disease  and  documented  endogenous  GAA  deficiency  in  peripheral  blood mononuclear cells.  Patients  had  to  have  confirmed  cardiomyopathy  as  measured  by  left  ventricular mass index (LVMI) ≥ 65 g/m², as assessed by a cardiologist with 2D echocardiography.

## Main exclusion criteria were :

- -Symptoms of respiratory insufficiency including O2 saturation &lt; 90% on room air (pulse oxymetry) and venous PCO2  &gt; 55 mmHg or arterial PCO2  &gt; 40 mmHg on room air.
- -Major congenital abnormality or clinically significant signs of organic disease other than those related to Pompe disease
- -Any ventilation use at enrolment
- -Patient already receiving ERT

## Treatment

Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous (IV) infusions of rhGAA at a dose of 20 or 40 mg/kg qow. The dose was further adjusted monthly based on changes in body weight. Infusions were administered in the morning following an overnight fast of at least 4 hours. The rate of infusion was increased incrementally to prevent infusion-associated reactions (IAR): initially 1 mg/kg/hr rate, which  was  gradually  increased  by  2  mg/kg/hr  every  30  minutes  if  no  signs  of  IAR  appeared; maximum  rate  was  7  mg/kg/hr.  Dosing  regimen  could  be  reduced  at  any  time  by  decrements  of 10 mg/kg/week in case of liver toxicity or other toxicity, symptoms of immune complex disease or IAR not responding to pre-treatment, rate reduction or treatment.

## Outcomes and endpoints

Primary efficacy endpoint at the 26-week interim analysis was percentage of patients alive and free of invasive  ventilator  support  (endotracheal  tube)  at  12  months  of  age  (both  dose  groups  combined), when compared to a comparable historical untreated cohort derived from the Natural History study. The primary efficacy analysis was later amended to be the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the % of patients alive and free of invasive ventilator support at 18 months of age.

Secondary efficacy endpoints at the 26-week interim analysis were 1) Percentage of patients alive and free of any ventilator support at 12 months of age (both dose groups combined), when compared to the corresponding Historical Reference Subgroup, 2) Assessment of changes in cardiomyopathy between baseline and week 26, as measured by echocardiography to determine LVMI, and 3) Assessment of changes in growth as measured by changes in weight, length and head circumference from baseline to week 26.

Other efficacy endpoints included 1) Percentage of patients alive at 12 months of age, 2) Percentage of patients  with  signs  and  symptoms  of  cardiac  failure,  3)  Assessment  of  motor  function  by  Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) from birth to the age of independent walking ( ≤ 18 months of age), and by corresponding number of development milestones achieved, 4) Assessment of cognitive function by BSID-II = modified Bayley Scales of Infant Development assessing cognitive, physical, language and speech, and psychosocial development of children from birth to 42 months of age and 5) Assessment of functional status and disability by Paediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) and Pompe PEDI.

## Statistical methods

Interim analysis was planned after the 18 th patient enrolled had completed 26 weeks of treatment. Noncompleters were considered as failures.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The % of patients alive and free of invasive ventilator support at the milestone of 12 and 18 months of age and the corresponding 95% 2-sided CI were estimated based on a Kaplan-Meier estimate from data  on  time  to  death  or  first  ventilator  use.  The  survival  curve  of  time  to  event  (death  or  invasive ventilatory  support)  from  birth  and  diagnosis  was  estimated.  The  %  of  patients  alive  and  free  of invasive ventilation were compared between the AGLU1602 patients population and a corresponding historical  reference  population  extracted  from  the  Natural  History  study.  (However,  the  invasive ventilator-free survival was not recorded in the historical population and therefore no final comparison was possible.) The same methodology of analysis was applied to 'any ventilator-free survival' and to 'survival'. For each secondary parameter, change from baseline was assessed.

As  reference  subgroup,  an  untreated  historical  cohort  of  patients  fulfilling  the  inclusion/exclusion criteria of AGLU1602 was selected among the 168 subjects of the Natural History study AGLU 00400,  using  mainly  the  following  criteria:  age  at  first  symptoms  and  age  at  diagnosis  &lt;  6  months, documented cardiomyopathy with LVMI &lt; 65g/m², and no ventilator use between 0 and 6 months of age.

## RESULTS

## Results/disposition of patients, demographics and baseline characteristics

Nineteen  patients  were  enrolled  and  18  treated  (the  19 th patient  experienced  an  adverse  event  that required ventilation during the baseline period before treatment initiation).

Median age at first symptoms, at diagnosis and at first infusion were 1 ± 1.8 (range 0.0-5.4), 4.4 ± 2.2 (0.2-6.8), and 5.3 ± 1.7 (6.3-43.1) months, respectively.

Survival results are given in the Tables 3-6  below.

After  52-weeks  of  treatment,  all  18  patients  treated  with  Myozyme  were  alive  and  15  of  these  18 patients  were  alive  and  free  of  invasive  ventilatory  support,  whereas  1  of  42  patients  in  historical control group was alive at 18 months of age. Comparison of survival curve from diagnosis versus the historical control population was made using a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.  After 52 weeks, patients treated with Myozyme demonstrated prolonged survival as compared to survival in an untreated historical cohort (see Table 3 below).

- An  Open-Label,  Multicenter,  Multinational  Study  of  the  Safety,  Efficacy,  Pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of Recombinant Human Acid alpha-Glucosidase (rhGAA) Treatment in Patients  &gt;6  and  &lt;36  Months  Old  with  Infantile-Onset  Pompe  Disease  (Glycogen  Storage Disease Type II) (AGLU01702; 52-week interim report)

## Study design and objectives

AGLU 1702 was an on-going phase II uncontrolled multicentre multinational (3 centres in the US, 1 in  the  UK,  1  in  France  and  1  in  Israel)  study  of  the  safety,  efficacy,  pharmacokinetics  and pharmacodynamics of Myozyme in infantile-onset Pompe disease patients during 52-week modules (initial 52-week treatment period followed by a 52-week maintenance module).

Interim analyses were done when the first 15 patients had completed 26 weeks of treatment, and when these 15 patients had completed 52 weeks of treatment.

## Study participants

## Main inclusion criteria

- Patients aged &gt; 6 months and ≤ 36 months adjusted for gestation at the time of the first dose of rhGAA and clinical diagnosis of infantile Pompe disease as defined by both documented onset of symptoms  compatible  with  Pompe  disease  by  12  months  of  age  (adjusted  for  gestation)  and documented endogenous GAA deficiency.
- LVMI as assessed by a cardiologist with 2D echocardiography ≥ 65 g/m² in patients ≤ 12 months of age or &gt; 79 g/m² in patients &gt; 12 months of age.

## Main exclusion criteria

- Signs and symptoms of cardiac failure and ejection fraction &lt; 40%
- Patient already receiving ERT
- Clinically significant signs of organic disease other than those related to Pompe disease

## Treatments

Patients were administered IV infusions of rhGAA at a dose of 20 mg/kg qow initially. The dose could be  further  adjusted  monthly  based  on  changes  in  body  weight.  The  rate  of  infusion  was  increased incrementally to prevent IARs: initially 1 mg/kg/hr rate, which was gradually increased by 2 mg/kg/hr every  30  minutes  if  no  signs  of  IAR  appeared;  maximum  was  7  mg/kg/hr.  Dosing  regimen  was changed to 10 mg/kg/week in case of liver toxicity, symptoms of immune complex disease, or IAR not responding to pre-treatment, rate reduction or treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Objectives

The  objective  was  to  study  efficacy,  safety,  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics.  No  placebo group was included into the study, but comparison to a historical control group was done.

## Outcomes/ endpoints

Primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  survival:  estimation  of  survival  from  birth  (all  causes  mortality), expressed as the % of patients alive over the course of treatment, in comparison with data from the Natural History study.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included the following:

-The  effect  on  respiratory  function.  This  was  measured  as  follows:  (a)  for  patients  who  were ventilator-free at the onset of the study, the proportion of patients who were alive and ventilator-free over the course of treatment and the ventilator-free survival time (time to first ventilator use or death); (b) for patients who required ventilator use at the onset of the study, the overall duration of ventilator support  and  the  number  of  hours  of  ventilator  use  (in  the  24  hours  preceding  each  infusion  visit, measured qow).

-The effect of treatment on cardiac status. This was measured by echocardiography (LVMI and left ventricular  posterior  wall  thickness,  LVPWT),  by  radiography  (thoracic  ratio  &gt;0.5)  and  by  the presence of any signs and/or symptoms of cardiac failure.

-The effect of treatment on motor development. This was measured by the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) from birth to the age of independent walking ( ≤ 18 months of age) and, for children aged &gt;18 months,  by  the  Peabody  developmental  Motor  Scale  (PDMS-2),  a  skill-based  measure  of  motor development in children aged 6 to 72 months. The patient's ability to achieve and maintain clinically relevant motor milestones was also assessed.

-Additional efficacy outcomes included the effect of treatment on: (1) the maintenance of cognitive function from baseline as measured by the MDI of the BSID-II; (2) physical growth by body length, weight,  and  head  circumference;  (3)  change  in  disability  index  from  baseline  as  measured  by  the PEDI; and (4) change in disability index from baseline as measured by the Pompe PEDI.

## Sample size

Protocol AGLU01702 was designed to enrol up to 20 patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease (21 were included).

## Randomisation, blinding, None

## Statistical methods

Interim analysis was done after the 15 th patient  enrolled  had  completed 26 weeks of treatment, and when these 15 patients had completed 52 weeks of treatment.

Non completers were considered as failures.

Primary endpoint/Survival: Patients were stratified by age at first infusion, and survival was analysed for all treated patients and separately depending on patients being aged ≤ 12 months or &gt; 12 months at the  time  of  first  infusion.  Survival  data  were  compared  1)  to  those  observed  in  a  subgroup  of  the Natural History study population (called Historical reference subgroup) who met the inclusion criteria of study 1702 (n=86 out of 168), and 2) to an Historical reference subgroup subset of 16 patients from the reference subgroup who survived past 15 months, i.e. the median age at first infusion for patients in AGLU-1702. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was also used.

Secondary endpoints: For each secondary parameter, change from baseline was assessed.

## RESULTS

Twenty-two  patients  were  enrolled  and  21  received  treatment.  One  patient  died  prior  to  receiving treatment. The interim analysis results reflected results from 15 patients treated  for 52 weeks. After 52 weeks of treatment with Myozyme, the survival rate was 73% (95% CI: 44.9, 92.2) compared to the corresponding survival figure of 37% (95% CI: 13.8, 61.2) in an untreated reference group. None of the deaths were assessed as treatment-related.

Eighty-seven percent of patients demonstrated a reduction in LVMI from baseline to last evaluation. LVMI at baseline declined by an average of 43% at week 26 and 48% at week 52. Echocardiographic measurements of cardiac function (ejection fraction [EF] and shortening fraction [SF]) demonstrated a trend  toward normalization through the 52-week treatment period: mean improvements of 33% and 19%  in  EF  and  SF,  respectively,  were  observed  after  52  weeks  of  treatment.  Maintenance  or improvement was seen in 80% of patients in weight-for-age percentiles; in 93% of patients in lengthfor-age percentiles; and 92% of patients in head circumference-for-age percentiles. Six of 15 patients (40%)  had  measurable  gains  in  motor  assessments  (AIMS  and/or  PDMS-2  gross  and  fine  motor skills),  as  determined  by  increases  in  raw  scores  and  age-equivalent  scores  from  baseline  to  last assessment.  The  remaining  patients  did  not  demonstrate  measurable  gains  across  these  motor assessments.  All  patients  with  repeat  evaluations  (n=13,  100%)  had  gains  in  BSID-II  Mental  Scale age-equivalent scores from baseline to the last study assessment, indicating the continued acquisition of cognitive, language, and personal/ social development skills.

## · Supportive phase II studies/ Infantile onset Pompe disease

In  studies  in  infantile-onset  Pompe  disease  with  earlier  rhGAA-products  treatment  with  rhGAA resulted in improvements in cardiomyopathy and global muscular function in all patients. When the results  of  all  these  patients  were  pooled,  the  median age at survival was 51.4 months. 12 out of 16 patients who were not ventilator-dependent at baseline had become ventilator-dependent (i.e. placed on invasive ventilator support) or died as of 1 July 2004. The median age of ventilator-free survival for those 16 patients was 28.7 months with a 95% CI of 13.8, 38.7.  All this data indicated that rhGAA affects mortality; however, determination of the effect size was not possible.

The results from the expanded access programs (see Table 2 above) with Myozyme were in line with the other studies in patients with infantile onset Pompe disease.

## Studies in patients with late-onset Pompe disease

Overall data from two clinical studies and expanded access programs were included in the MAA so that in the original MAA 15 late-onset patients (aged 6 to 54 years at onset of therapy; disease severity ranging from those patients who were relatively early in their disease progression, i.e. able to ambulate freely, not requiring ventilator support, to relatively late in their disease progression, i.e. wheelchairbound, ventilator-dependent) were treated with rhGAA for 6 months to 5 years (duration on Myozyme ranging from 6 months to 2.5 years). (See Table 2 above.)

The open-label clinical trial AGLU02804 assessed the safety and efficacy of Myozyme in 5 patients with late-onset Pompe disease who ranged in age from 5 to 15 years at initiation of treatment. Patients received 20 mg/kg Myozyme every other week for 26 weeks. All patients were freely ambulatory and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

all  but  one  patient  did  not  require any form of ventilator support (1 patient required nocturnal noninvasive ventilation). Two patients out of 3 with pulmonary involvement (FVC 58-67% of predicted values) had significant improvement in FVC (+11.5% and +16%, respectively); the third did not. The two patients with improved pulmonary function had increases in Manual Muscle Testing of strength, but not in Hand-Held Dynamometric values or in Energy Expenditure Index. Only one of these two patients  improved  on  the  6-min  Walk  Test.  Thus,  the  effects  of  Myozyme  in  patients  with  mild  to moderate (treated relatively early) late-onset Pompe disease were uncertain.

Data  was  also  submitted  on  10  patients  with  advanced  late-onset  Pompe  disease  treated  with Myozyme at 20 mg/kg qow to 40 mg/kg qw for 6 months to 2.5 years (including 3 patients treated with  different  forms  of  rhGAA  for  a  total  of  5  years).  At  baseline,  all  but  one  of  the  10  patients required invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support for most of the day and all 10 were wheelchairdependent. Therefore, tests of pulmonary function and muscle strength were very difficult to perform and assessment of the clinical status of these patients relied exclusively on physician's narrative. Only one  patient  had  cardiomyopathy.  One  11-year-old  boy  who  was  not  ventilator-dependent  but  was using a wheelchair since the age of 9 started treatment (not with Myozyme) and, 72 weeks later, he could  stand  with  difficulty;  at  84  weeks  he  could  walk  and  at  108  weeks  he  could  abandon  his wheelchair; he has lived normally thereafter. The nine other patients remained ventilator-dependent, but had different signs of possible improvements in their lung or muscle functions, and in their wellbeing.

After the oral explanation the CHMP requested the applicant to submit any further data on patients with late-onset Pompe disease: the applicant submitted physicians' narratives on 10 patients treated with Myozyme for more than 6 months, 2 of whom had been included with preliminary data in the previous list,  and  8  of  whom were new patients from Expanded Access Program AGLU02603 (see Table 2). The preliminary results of these patients were in line with the earlier submitted data. Overall, 5/18  late-onset  Pompe  disease  patients  who  could  only  be  evaluated  through  physicians'  narratives showed  clinically  significant  decreases  in  the  number  of  hours  of  non  invasive  ventilation  (from approximately 20 h/day to 10 h/day); 4/18 had increased ambulation, including one who fell and broke her femur; and many gained weight or had declared improvements in their quality of life.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

The study AGLU01602 showed that treatment with Myozyme of patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease  aged  less  than  6  months  significantly  prolonged  survival  and  ventilator-free  survival  at  18months of age compared to a historical control subgroup. Thus, patients experienced prevention or delay of the use of invasive and noninvasive ventilator support providing them with increased mobility and freedom from mechanical supports during their survival time. Significant clinical benefit was also observed in the majority of the patients in terms of improvements in cardiomyopathy, growth, motor function,  as  well  as  in  functional  skills/status.  These  conclusions  did  not  change  when  additional analyses,  requested  by  the  CHMP  during  the  procedure,  were  employed  (including  a  Cox  analysis after controlling for e.g. age at diagnosis, age at first symptoms, and birth year).

During the procedure CHMP requested the applicant to analyse whether patients who were already ventilator-dependent  should  be  treated  with  Myozyme,  since  many  of  them  would  not  derive  any benefit  in  terms  of  pulmonary function, and other clinical benefits had not been quantified in these patients. However, the number of these ventilator-dependent patients with early-onset Pompe disease was limited and thus no conclusions could be made. The applicant will address this aspect in their planned clinical study in late-onset Pompe disease patients.

There were no differences between 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg doses in study AGLU1602 in any of the studied endpoints. In addition, patients receiving 40 mg/kg tended to develop a more robust antibody response and more IARs compared to those receiving 20 mg/kg. Further, skeletal muscle GAA activity increased  and  skeletal  muscle  glycogen  content  decreased  only  slightly  more  with  40  mg/kg  dose compared to the 20 mg/kg dose. Therefore, the CHMP recommended marketing authorisation only for the 20 mg/kg dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Further, the CHMP requested the applicant to study prognostic factors for good or poor response to Myozyme-treatment, e.g. muscle biopsies at different time points. No such prognostic factors could yet be identified. The applicant committed to search for such factors as a follow-up measure.

One  main  question  was  whether  results  obtained  in  infantile-onset  Pompe  disease  patients  treated before the age of 6 months could be extrapolated to late-onset disease patients, as late-onset Pompe disease is also a progressive disease, but its course differs significantly from that of the infantile-onset form  of  the  disease.  It  was  recognised  that  some  of  the  late-onset  disease  patients  treated  with Myozyme had shown positive clinical responses. However, these data remained difficult to interpret in the absence of clear endpoints, including for quality of life assessment, and due to the lack of a valid control  group.  It  is  also  known  that  some  patients  with  late-onset  Pompe  disease  may  experience  a rapid  deterioration  in  skeletal  and  respiratory  muscle  function  leading  to  loss  of  ambulation  and respiratory failure, while others progress less rapidly, and yet others present with a dissociation in the progression  of  skeletal  and  respiratory  muscle  involvement.  Thus,  complete  extrapolation  of  the results from infantile-onset to late-onset disease was not considered a valid approach in general. This is expressed in the SPC in 4.1 and 5.1. The applicant committed to carry out a randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study in patients with mild to moderate late-onset Pompe disease in order to quantify the effect of Myozyme in this population. The applicant also committed to submit the final results  of  two  other  ongoing  clinical  studies  in  these  late-onset  Pompe  disease  patients  (i.e. AGLU02804, an open-label study on safety, PK and efficacy in five patients; and AGLU03105, an open-label  study  on  safety  and  efficacy  in  five  patients  who  are  receiving  respiratory  support)  as follow-up measures.

## Clinical safety

## · Patient exposure

As of March 2005, a total of 61 patients from clinical studies and Expanded Access programme have received  from  1  to  110  weeks  (median  56  weeks)  of  Myozyme  treatment  primarily  at  doses  of  20 mg/kg  qow  and  40  mg/kg  qow  (but  ranging  from  10  mg/kg  qw  up  to  40  mg/kg  qw).  Eleven  (11) patients have received Myozyme for  &lt; 26 weeks, while 15 patients have received Myozyme for &gt; 26 weeks but &lt; 52 weeks, and 35 patients have received Myozyme for &gt; 52 weeks.

## · Adverse events

Most adverse events reported in 39 infantile-onset Pompe patients treated with Myozyme up to more than one year (76 weeks) during the two main clinical studies were consistent with the natural course of Pompe disease. Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) related to Myozyme reported in more than one patient are listed in Table 9 by System Organ Class. The ADRs listed are shown as percentage of patients experiencing the ADR with the absolute number of patients in brackets. ADRs were mostly mild to moderate in intensity and 82% were assessed as IARs (occurred during the infusion or during the 2 hours following the infusion).

A  limited  number  of  patients  with  late-onset  Pompe  disease  were  treated  with  Myozyme.  ADRs related to Myozyme reported in 2 of 9 late-onset patients treated with Myozyme for up to 1 year in 3 different studies included increased heart rate, hypertension, headache, peripheral coldness, paresthesia, flushing, infusion site pain, infusion site reaction, increased blood pressure and dizziness. All ADRs were seen in a single patient, mild in intensity and assessed as an IARs.

In general, the adverse drug reaction profiles were similar in infantile-onset and in late-onset patients.

## Adverse events of particular interest

Pyrexia was the most frequently reported AE in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease. Pyrexia was  often  associated  with  underlying  infection,  predominantly  upper  respiratory  tract  infections, which  are  commonly  observed  in  patients  with  Pompe  disease.  In  the  Infantile-onset  pooled population (AGLU01602 and AGLU01702), 89.7% of the patients experienced 139 events of pyrexia. The  majority  of  the  events  of  pyrexia  were  assessed  as  mild  and  not  related  to  Myozyme.  In  the majority  of  patients,  pyrexia  assessed  as  related  to  Myozyme  occurred  during  the  infusion,  was transient  and  episodic  in  nature,  and  resolved  with  intervention  (antipyretics  and/or  temporary interruption of the infusion). All patients recovered without sequelae from the event of pyrexia. No correlation was observed between the occurrence of pyrexia and duration of treatment.

Infusion  associated  reactions  (IARs)  were  defined  as  those  AEs  which  occurred  following  the initiation of the infusion up to and including the 2 hour post-infusion observation period and that were assessed by the Investigator as related to Myozyme administration. They were reported for 18 of the 39  patients  treated  with  Myozyme  in  the  infantile-onset  pooled  population  (AGLU01602  and AGLU01702), 2 of the 5 patients in Study AGLU02203, 2 of the 7 patients in Study AGLU02003, 1 of the 3 patients in the AGLU02503 Programme, and the single patient in Study AGLU02103. IARs were  generally  well  tolerated,  and  were  managed  with  rate  reduction  and/or  an  interruption  of  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Myozyme infusion. There were no dose reductions required due to IARs and no patients discontinued due to IARs.  The onset of IARs did not correlate with IgG titer or time of seroconversion. No patient experienced IgE-mediated acute-type hypersensitivity reaction.

In  AGLU01602 there were 31 IARs in 4 patients  with  40  mg/kg  dose,  compared  to  11  IARs  in  4 patients with 20 mg/kg dose.

## · Serious adverse events (SAEs)/ deaths/ other significant events

Overall,  the  majority  of  the  patients  treated  with  Myozyme  experienced  at  least  one  SAE,  most  of which were assessed as not related to treatment with Myozyme and some also reported at baseline. SAEs involved predominantly infections, respiratory related complications, and cardiac disorders. In the  infantile-onset  pooled  population  (AGLU01602  and  AGLU01702)  33  of  39  (84.5%)  patients experienced at least one SAE for a total of 213 SAEs after initiation of treatment. The most common SAEs were respiratory failure (9 patients [23.1%], 23 events [10.8%]), pneumonia (7 patients [17.9%], 18  events  [8.5%]),  catheter  related  infection  (7  patients  [17.9%],  9  events  [4.2%]),  and  respiratory distress  (7  patients  [17.9%],  9  events  [4.2%]),  pyrexia  (5  patients  [12.8%],  6  events  [2.8%]), pneumonia  aspiration  (4  patients  [10.3%],  15  events  [7.0%]),  bronchiolitis  (4  patients  [10.3%],  5 events  [2.3%]),  and  oxygen  saturation  decreased  (4  patients  [10.3%],  4  events  [1.9%]).  Twenty (51.3%) of 39 patients experienced at least one serious respiratory related event.

Seventy percent (70%) of the treatment-emergent SAEs (151 of 213 events) were mild to moderate in severity. Fifteen (15) patients experienced 62 SAEs assessed as severe, none of which was assessed as related  to  Myozyme.  Eleven  (11)  of  the  213  (5.2%)  SAEs  were  assessed  as  related  to  treatment (IARs).  SAEs  generally  resolved  without  sequelae  after  medication,  non-drug  therapy,  and/or hospitalisation.

Overall,  9  of  61  patients  in  the  total  population  who  received  treatment  with  Myozyme  through  a clinical  trial  and/or  expanded  access  programme  died.  Median  exposure  to  Myozyme  in  these  9 patients was 4.3 months (range 0.1 to 14 months). The deaths were due to cardiorespiratory causes consistent with complications of the underlying Pompe disease. None of these deaths were assessed as related to Myozyme by the Investigator.

## · Laboratory findings

No significant abnormalities in laboratory tests were detected. Most patients with Pompe disease had elevated AST, ALT or CK levels prior to the initiation of the treatment; no consistent changes in these values were observed in clinical studies following initiation of Myozyme treatment.

## Immunological responses

Immunologic responses are expected in patients who are treated with recombinant human proteins. Anti-rhGAA  antibody  assessment  consisted  of  a  2-step  process:  an  ELISA  screening  assessment followed  by  a  confirmatory  radioimmunoprecipitation  assay.  Further  ELISA  assays  were  used  to determine  the  titer  of  anti-rhGAA  antibodies.  All  IgG  seropositive  patients  were  tested  for  the presence of IgG inhibitory antibodies to rhGAA. The majority of the patients developed anti-rhGAA antibodies within three months of Myozyme treatment. One patient treated with Myzoyme at a dose of 40 mg/kg qow developed extremely high titres of IgG antibodies (&gt;1.5 x 10 6 ); inhibitory antibodies were  detected  while  a  clinical  decline  was  observed.  In  addition,  one  patient  developed  a  positive inhibitory  antibody  response  after  2.5  years  of  treatment  while  being  treated  with  rhGAA  obtained from a different source at a dose of 10 mg/kg qd 5x/week. This patient developed nephrotic syndrome and immune complex deposition.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

No patient discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, with the exception of the observed deaths.

## · Post marketing experience

Not applicable.

## · Readability testing

The applicant committed to provide readability testing ('user consultation') report as a follow-up measure.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

Myozyme treatment was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse reactions were pyrexia (probably due to Pompe disease), flushing, urticaria and rash - the majority were assessed as IARs. When  IARs  occurred,  the  events  were  typically  managed  with  infusion  rate  reductions  and/or pretreatment,  when  necessary.  Pretreatment  medications  were  not  routinely  administered  to  all patients.  No  patients  discontinued  treatment  due  to  IARs.  The  only  real  concern  with  Myozyme treatment  was  the  systematic  development  of  rhGAA  IgG  antibodies.  One  patient  treated  with Myozyme  developed  inhibitory  antibodies;  another  patient  who  was  treated  with  earlier  rhGAAproduct  also  developed  inhibitory  antibodies.  This  patient  who  received  frequent  dosing  of  rhGAA over extended time also developed circulating immune complexes with immune complex disposition and nephrotic syndrome. The applicant committed to monitor closely the immunological response of patients treated with Myozyme in the post-marketing phase (see the Risk Management Plan below).

## 5. Pharmacovigilance

##  Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.

##  Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan (RMP). In the plan the applicant committed to carry out an immunosurveillance programme to monitor immunological response (including possible formation of  inhibitory  antibodies)  to  Myozyme  treatment.  In  addition,  the  applicant  committed  to  amend  the existing Pompe registry of untreated Pompe disease patients to include collection of data for patients treated with Myozyme to facilitate the evaluation of long-term efficacy and safety through the registry. Further, the applicant will also introduce an educational programme for the prevention and treatment of  infusion  associated  reactions  and  development  of  antibodies.  Educational  material  will  be  also provided  for  physicians  on  the  risks  of  the  drug  if  used  during  pregnancy.  The  applicant  also committed to monitor liver function tests through the clinical programme, although disturbances of liver  function  tests  observed  in  the  clinical  studies  were  most  probably  the  result  of  the  underlying disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  is  of  the  opinion  that  the following  risk  minimisation  activities  are  necessary  for  the  safe  and  effective  use  of  this  medicinal product:  The  company  will  provide  educational  material  regarding  the  IARs,  development  of antibodies and on the risks of the drug when used during pregnancy. Given that the product will be used by special physicians experienced in the management of patients with Pompe disease or other inherited metabolic or neuromuscular diseases, the CHMP considered that there is no need to further specify  the  content  in  the  opinion.  Different  safety  issues  in  the  RMP  should  be  reviewed  in  the updates to the EU-RMP.

## 6. Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Quality

Myozyme was demonstrated to have satisfactory quality attributes and product manufactured by the 2000 L process (only) was recommended for approval.

Since a high dose of rhGAA is administered to patients, a relatively high level of protein impurities (host  cell  proteins)  will  also  be  administered.    Therefore,  this  should  be  considered  from  a  clinical perspective with regard to potential antibody formation.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Results of pharmacodynamic studies suggested effective depletion of glycogen when Myozyme was administered to GAA-knockout mice in an animal model of Pompe disease. A dose range of 10-40 mg/kg of Myozyme was evaluated over a period of weeks for ability to clear glycogen from target tissues (heart and skeletal muscles).

Histamine  and  significant  IgG  and  IgG1  antibody  titers  were  consistent  with  a  hypersensitivity response in mice.

The pharmacokinetic data showed a good linearity across species.

There were no toxic findings that were consistent across all species tested. Slight embryo-fetal effects were seen in the mouse at high dose (malrotated limbs), and a study in rabbits will be available in post-authorisation  (as  a  follow-up  measure).  Small  effects  on  male  and  female  fertility  were  also observed and the results of further investigations will be available in post-authorisation (as a follow-up measure). A warning in pregnancy is included in the SPC (4.6).

It is clear from the data presented that there was a consistent finding of hypersensitivity in many of the animal models evaluated. With the exception of the non-human primate study, all species administered Myozyme  showed  some  kind  of  hypersensitivity  response.  This  hypersensitivity  response  was  not included in the consideration of the NOAEL.

## Clinical Efficacy

Myozyme  is  a  recombinant  GAA  thus  restoring  lysosomal  GAA  activity  resulting  in  decrease  of muscle  glycogen  accumulation.  Treatment  with  Myozyme  increased  survival  and  ventilator  free survival  in  patients  with  infantile-onset  Pompe  disease  treated  before  6  months  of  age.  It  also improved cardiac, motor and respiratory function, as well as growth and functional skills/ status in these patients .

In patients with late-onset Pompe disease the benefits of Myozyme could be evaluated in a 5-patient observational  study  where  2/3  patients  with  pulmonary  involvement  had  increases  in  forced  vital capacity  after  6  months  of  treatment.  Physicians'  narratives  were  available  in  another  18  patients treated  under  open  access  programs.  The  effects  of  Myozyme were highly variable and its efficacy could not be quantified, although some patients showed clinically significant decreases in the number of hours of non invasive ventilation, had increased ambulation, or gained weight.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The applicant committed to carry out a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in lateonset  Pompe  disease  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  disease  in  order  to  quantify  the  efficacy  of Myzoyme.  The  applicant  also  committed  to  submit  the  final  results  of  two  other  ongoing  clinical studies in these late-onset Pompe disease patients. (i.e. AGLU02804, an open-label study on safety, PK and efficacy in five patients; and AGLU03105, an open-label study on safety and efficacy in five patients who are receiving respiratory support).

## Clinical Safety

Myozyme treatment was well tolerated. The most common adverse reactions were pyrexia, flushing, urticaria  and  rash  (usually  as  infusion  associated  reactions).  The  only  real  concern  was  systematic development of IgG rhGAA antibodies; inhibitory antibodies were detected in two patients (one with Myozyme, one with Synpac rhGAA) during the development. The applicant committed to carry out a post-marketing immunosurveillance programme .

## Benefit/risk assessment

Infantile-onset  Pompe  disease  is  a  serious  disease  usually  resulting  in  death  before  the  age  of  12 months.  No  medicinal  product  has  been  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  Pompe  disease  in  the  EU before Myozyme. Myozyme increases, robustly, survival and ventilator free survival in these patients. It also improves cardiac, motor and respiratory function, as well as growth and functional status/skills. Myozyme treatment is generally well tolerated. The only concern is systematic development of IgG rhGAA antibodies; the applicant has committed to post-marketing immunosurveillance programme .

In  late-onset  Pompe  disease  patients  the  benefits  of  Myozyme  remained  uncertain.  The  applicant committed to carry out a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in these patients in order to confirm the encouraging preliminary findings.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion  that  some  pharmacovigilance  activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine  pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some safety concerns (see the Risk management Table 10 above). The  following  additional  risk  minimisation  activity  was  required:  Educational  material  will  be provided to physicians on infusion associated reactions, development of antibodies and on the risks of the drug if used during pregnancy.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the benefit/risk ratio of Myozyme in the treatment of Pompe disease was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation in the following indication:

'Myozyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease (acid α -glucosidase deficiency).

The benefits of Myozyme in patients with late-onset Pompe disease have not been established (see SPC section 5.1).'
