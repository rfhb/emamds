## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for lenalidomide, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In  view  of  the  large  number  of  cases  of  pulmonary  hypertension  collected  in  the  cumulative  review, including cases with a suggestive chronology and positive dechallenge, and considering that there is a plausible mechanism of action and a possible class effect, the PRAC considers that a causal relationship between lenalidomide and pulmonary hypertension is plausible. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing lenalidomide should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for lenalidomide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing lenalidomide is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
