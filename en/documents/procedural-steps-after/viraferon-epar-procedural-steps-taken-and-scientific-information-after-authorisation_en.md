Extensions of indication to include treatment of HCV in HIV/HCV co-infected patients were granted by the CHMP for the alfa 2b pegylated interferons and Rebetol in June 2007 based on the results of 2 clinical trials conducted in patients co- infected with HIV and HCV. The results of these two studies are now reflected in the SPC of the standard interferons. Additionally it is mentioned that in both studies, patients who received standard interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. |

In all cases, the role of alfa interferon could not be totally ruled out. However it is now well- recognized that Hepatitis C infection itself can be involved in the development of auto-immune disorders. The CHMP considered that the very rare frequency and the seriousness of this hardly known disease must be taken into account and therefore the adverse reaction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Pure red cell aplasia is a condition where the body stops or reduces the production of red blood cells. This causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack of energy. A number of cases reported in the safety review are in favour of a potential link between ribavirin and/or interferon therapy and the development of pure red cell aplasia due to a suggestive chronology.

Due to differences in the indications it was not possible to propose a class labelling \"text\" for all these products. Therefore the existing paragraphs pertaining to psychiatric disorders in the SPC and Package Leaflet of Viraferon have been moved to the beginning of the corresponding sections and placed in a warning box in order to draw attention to these serious adverse effects.                                                                                                                                        |
| II/0049 | Medicinal product Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Update of section 4.6 of the SPC with regard to recommendations on pregnancy and lactation. This change is further to the adoption of a class labelling by the CHMP on 26 January 2006 for the interferons and ribavirin on pregnancy and lactation. Corresponding revisions to the Package Leaflet are made. | 27/04/2006          | 19/05/2006                               | SPC, PL                          | The need to harmonise the SPCs of the ribavirin and alfa interferon containing medicinal products has been highlighted on previous occasions as existing discrepancies regarding the recommendations for pregnancy and lactation might be confusing for prescribers and patients. The CHMP concluded that contraceptive measures should be used during treatment and for 4 months after treatment discontinuation in female patients and their partners and during treatment and for 7 months after treatment discontinuation in male patients and their female partners. Section 4.6 of the SPC of Viraferon has therefore been updated to add the seven month duration of contraction for male patients and their female partners when alfa-interferon is used in combination with ribavarin. Regarding lactation the CHMP agreed that given the importance of the treatment to the mother, prescribers should not be given a choice between the discontinuation of treatment or breastfeeding. Rather a warning should be included in Section 4.6 that breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to treatment. |

| II/0048 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet Update of Section 4.4 of the Viraferon SPC, further to the assessment of PSUR 7 and of Pharmacovigilance follow up measures, to alert the prescribers on the fact that patients treated with ribavirin and interferon combination therapy and Zidovudine could be at higher risk of developing anaemia. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. The annexes have also been updated in line with the latest QRD template (version 7). | 23/03/2006          | 27/04/2006                               | SPC, Labelling, PL               | longer authorised Further to the assessment of PSUR 7 for IntronA/Viraferon (period covered 8 March 2004 to 9 September 2004) a report has drawn attention to a potential increase of anaemia in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV who received concomitant treatment with interferon or pegylated interferon and ribavirin with Zidovudine (AZT). As anaemia seemed is an important limiting factor for the success of combination therapy in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV, the CHMP requested that theMAH review safety data with regard to the necessity to include a warning in the SPC and Package Leaflet. In light of the safety review provided by the company the CHMP concluded that the hypothesis of an interference between haemolysis due to ribavirin and the myelosuppresive effect of AZT with reduction of erythropoiesis as suggested in literature should be taken into consideration. This has been reflected as a warning in the SPC of Rebetol, IntronA/Viraferon, and PegIntron/ViraferonPeg.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| II/0047 | Medicinal product Update of Summary of Product Characteristics Update of the information in section 5.1 of Viraferon SPC with results of the long-term follow-up protocol to assess patients after completing 24 weeks of follow-up in a clinical trial for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C with Rebetol and Intron A.                                                                                                                                                                                                | 23/02/2006          | 29/03/2006                               | no SPC                           | This was a 5-year, long-term follow-up study of naïve or relapse subjects who completed the 24-week follow-up period in 1 of 6, placebo controlled treatment protocols comparing IntronA (non pegylated interferon alfa-2b)/Rebetol (ribavirin) combination therapy (for 24 or 48 weeks), with Intron A monotherapy (for 24 or 48 weeks) in naïve or relapse subjects. Long-term follow-up began at the Follow- Up Week 24 visit in the treatment protocol, ie, 6 months post- treatment. The results of the study confirm the durability of the virologic response up to 5 years. The likelihood of maintaining virologic response over 5 years in subjects who initially achieved a sustained response is 97% with a 95% Confidence Interval of [95%, 99%]. The limitations of the study (limited percentage of non responders that enter the long term study and high number of discontinuation), preclude any conclusion across initial treatment groups. Further, if the long-term clearance of the virus could be considered as a clinical 'cure' from chronic HCV, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events related to progression of liver disease. This change in section 5.1 of the SPC applies to Rebetol and also to Intron A and Viraferon, both non pegylated Interferon alfa-2b. |

The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAHtook the opportunity to introduce in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet the minor CHMP quality comments resulting from the recent renewal procedure and to update the \"how to self-inject\" instructions in the Package Leaflet of the multidose pen presentations. Section 4.4 of the SPC now states: Psychiatric and central nervous system (CNS): Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during Viraferon therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. Among children and adolescents treated with Viraferon in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 %vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with Viraferon be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. |

In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of Viraferon and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The decision to treat should be made on a case by case basis, taking into account any evidence of disease progression such as hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, as well as prognostic factors for response, HCV genotype and viral load. The expected benefit of treatment should be weighed against the safety findings observed for paediatric subjects in the clinical trials. Interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 is administered subcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or solution administered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening). (See ribavirin capsule SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dosage modification guidelines for combination therapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution SPC). |

A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57% male, 80 %Caucasian, and 78 %genotype 1, 64 %£12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted in children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. Sustained virological response rates in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b needs to be carefully considered in this population. Summary of Clinical Efficacy: Virological response in previously untreated paediatric patients Viraferon 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week +ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day Overall Response1 (n=118) 54 (46 %)* Genotype 1 (n=92) 33 (36 %)* Genotype 2/3/4 (n=26) 21 (81 %)* *Number (%) of patients 1. Defined as HCV-RNA below limit of detection using a research based RT-PCR assay at end of treatment and during follow-up period Summary of Clinical Safety: In clinical trials of 118 children or adolescents 3 to 16 years of age, 6 %discontinued therapy due to adverse events. In general, the adverse event profile in the limited paediatric population studied was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric specific concern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in height (mean percentile decrease of growth velocity of 9 %) and weight (mean percentile |

Furthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 %vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). In addition, injection site disorders, fever, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and adolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30% of patients, most commonly for anaemia and neutropaenia. Thyroid Monitoring: Approximately 12 %of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin developed increase in TSH during interferon alfa-2b treatment. Another 4 %had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of Viraferon therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. Viraferon therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has been observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient's thyroid status should be evaluated and treated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH). Growth and Development: During a 1-year course of therapy there was a decrease in the rate of linear growth (mean percentile decrease of 9 %) and a decrease in the rate of weight gain (mean percentile decrease of 13 %). A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 6 months follow-up post treatment. However, based on interim data from a long-term follow-up study, 12 (14 %) of 84 children had a > 15 percentile decrease in rate of linear growth, of whom 5 (6 %) children had a > 30 percentile decrease despite being off treatment for more than 1 year. There are no data on long-term effects on growth and development and on sexual maturation. |
