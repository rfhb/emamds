## 2.3. Clinical aspects

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Study M16-049 An Open-label Multiple-Dose Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Upadacitinib in Pediatric Subjects with Severe Atopic Dermatitis

## 2.3.1. Clinical study

## Clinical study M16-049

## Description

Study M16-049 was a Phase 1, multiple-dose, open-label study that consisted of two parts in 35 pediatric male and female subjects with severe AD, aged 2 years to less than 12 years.

The study was comprised of a 35-day Screening Period, a 1-week open-label treatment period in Part 1, a 108-week open-label treatment period for Part 2, and an end of study follow-up visit.

Part 1 was a multiple-dose, open-label, multiple cohort study that consists of two sequential multipleascending dose groups (Low Dose and High Dose levels) in the two age groups. Subjects 2 to &lt; 12 years of age were categorized based on age group, and the dose administered for seven consecutive days was based on predefined body weight categories per dose level. The dose levels and body weight categories are presented in Table 1 for subjects 2 to &lt; 12 years of age. After receipt of FDA advice, subjects less than 3 years of age were discontinued from the study and only subjects 3 years to &lt; 12 years of age were enrolled in the study beginning with Protocol Version 6.0 until study conclusion.

On Study Day 7 of Part 1, serial blood samples for assay of upadacitinib were collected for up to 24 hours for QD dosing and or up to 12 hours for BID dosing.

Subjects who completed Part 1 had the option to enroll in Part 2 at the investigator's discretion and when enrolled were to have received open-label upadacitinib at the Low Dose level as described in Table 1. Pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability data were analyzed on a periodic basis as the data became available during the course of the study.

Part 2 was a multiple-dose, open-label, long-term extension to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of upadacitinib.

During Part 2 of the study, subjects with an EASI score worsening of 25% or more compared with their baseline EASI score at any two consecutive scheduled study visits after Week 4 or subjects who do not achieve at least a 50% improvement in their EASI score compared to baseline at two consecutive visits on or after Week 8 were to have discontinued study drug and were to receive treatment at investigator's discretion and in accordance with local standard-of-care.

A schematic of the overall study design is shown in Figure 1.

* Beginning with Protocol Version 6.0, only subjects 3 years and older were enrolled for the remainder of this study per FDA's request.

Note: All subjects were to have received upadacitinib at the low dose level in Part 2.

## Baseline data

A total of 35 pediatric subjects were randomized at 11 study sites located in the United States and Puerto Rico. Prior to enrollment in the study, each subject was judged to be in good health based on review of his/her medical history, a physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG and laboratory tests. At baseline, male and female subjects enrolled in this study were ages 2 years to less than 12 years at screening, and total body weight 10 kg or higher at the time of baseline were enrolled.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subjects 3 years to less than 12 years were enrolled in the study from protocol version 6.0 going forward. Criteria for AD included subjects diagnosed with AD with onset of symptoms at least 6 months prior to baseline and meeting Hanifin and Rajka criteria, EASI score ≥ 21, Validated Investigator Global Assessment (vIGA)AD score equal to 4, ≥ 15% body surface area of AD involvement. Additionally, subjects were required to have a documented history (within 12 months prior to the baseline visit) of inadequate response to topical corticosteroids (TCS) or topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) or for whom use of TCS and TCIs is otherwise medically inadvisable.

## Efficacy results

Clinical efficacy parameters were collected as exploratory measures and to facilitate the assessment of benefit-risk to justify a continuation of Low Dose upadacitinib during Part 2. There were no formal statistical comparisons of efficacy. The overall population was summarized for efficacy.

A vIGA-AD score of 0 or 1 (with at least two grades of reduction from baseline) at Week 12 was achieved by 11/30 subjects (36.7%) in the overall population across cohorts.

EASI 75 at Week 12 was achieved by 21/30 subjects (70.0%) for the overall population across cohorts.

The mean and median percent change from baseline of the EASI score at Week 12 for the overall population across cohorts was -80.77% (N = 30, SD = 18.769) and -84.29% (Q1 = -94.56, Q3 = -69.66), respectively.

A vIGA-AD score of 0 or 1, EASI 75, and percent change from baseline in EASI were maintained through Week 108.

In Part 1, 20% of subjects reported TEAEs and in Part 2, 87.9% of subjects reported TEAEs, with a similar proportion of AEs between the two age groups.

No AEs of special interest (AESI) were reported in Part 1. Six subjects reported AESIs in Part 2 with serious infections of COVID-19 and ophthalmic herpes zoster reported in the older age group (6 to &lt; 12 years) and elevated CPK, herpes zoster, and neutropenia in the younger age group (2 to &lt; 6 years). No SAEs were reported in Part 1. Three SAEs (COVID-19, ophthalmic herpes zoster, and major depression) during Part 2 were reported in the study.

Upadacitinib was generally safe and well tolerated for pediatric subjects with severe AD. No new safety risks were identified compared to the known safety profile for upadacitinib in adults and adolescents with AD.

## Pharmacokinetic Results

In pediatric subjects with severe AD, upadacitinib maximum plasma concentrations were reached within approximately 2 to 3 hours following the administration of the extended-release tablet formulation and 0.5 to 2 hours following the administration of the immediate release oral solution. Upadacitinib functional t½, calculated from the Cmax to Ctrough ratio at steady state, was approximately 4 to 5 hours, for the extended-release QD and 2 to 3 hours for the oral solution BID regimens, and was consistent between the two age groups. Upadacitinib apparent oral clearance increased with increasing body weight in pediatric subjects with severe AD.

## 2.3.2. Discussion on clinical aspects

The primary aim of Study M16-049 was to identify a suitable dose regimen for younger paediatric patients with atopic dermatitis in the further clinical development of Rinvoq. No formal efficacy evaluation has been conducted in this study. No new safety signals were identified compared to the known safety profile for adults and adolescents. However, no definite conclusions on the safety profile for younger paediatric patients can be made at this stage due to limited data.

The final data of Study M16-049 does not warrant any further update of the SmPC.
