| II/0026  | Following a CHMP request, the Marketing Authorisation Holder applied for an update of section 4.2 (Posology and method of administration), section 4.4 (Special warnings and special precautions for use) and section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to include safety information regarding three suspected adverse drug reactions involving skin lesions in children. The Package Leaflet (PL) has been amended accordingly. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 26/05/2005   | 07/07/2005   | SmPC and PL                      | In December 2004, the MAH (Marketing Authorisation Holder) informed the EMEA and the Rapporteur about three cases of serious skin reactions over the elbows resembling Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) in patients treated with Cystagon. All of them were observed in Ireland and one was fatal. The MAH issued a letter in order to inform the concerned specialised physicians about this finding, and requesting information on new cases. As a result, an additional case from Italy was reported (in this fourth case, the child was treated with a formulation of cysteamine chlorhydrate, not Cystagon, when the adverse reaction appeared). Following the evaluation of the available information of these cases, the CHMP requested the MAH to submit a type II variation to reflect the new information. Sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), and relevant sections of the Package Leaflet (PL) were amended in order to include information regarding these events. |
