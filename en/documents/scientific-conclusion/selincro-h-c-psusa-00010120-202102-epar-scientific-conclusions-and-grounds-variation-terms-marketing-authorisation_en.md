## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for nalmefene, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on 'visual impairment' from clinical trial(s) and spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between nalmefene and 'visual impairment' is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC Rapporteur concluded that the product information of products containing nalmefene should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for nalmefene the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing nalmefene is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
