## I RECOMMENDATION

Based on the review of the data submitted by the MAH as evidence of compliance with the specific obligations  and  having  re-assessed  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  the  medicinal  product  further  to  the provision of comprehensive data on efficacy and safety such that the grounds set out in Part II.6 of Annex I  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  are  no  longer  applying  to  maintain  the  MA  under  Article  14(8)  of Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004,  the  CHMP  recommends  to  change  the  status  of  the  marketing authorisation outside the scope of Art. 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for Pandemrix (Influenza vaccine (H1N1)v (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted).

The  reason  for  the  CHMP's  recommendation  that  a  MA  under  exceptional  circumstances  should  be granted initially  was  due  to  the  provision  of  limited  safety  and  immunogenicity  data  generated  with vaccine  construct  including  potential  influenza  pandemic  (mock-up)  strain,  A(H5N1).  This  A(H5N1) strain was not circulating in humans and the mock-up vaccine was not intended for use until, firstly the specific  influenza  virus  strain  would  be  identified  and  included  in  the  vaccine  and,  secondly  the influenza pandemic officially declared (as described in the Annex II.B of the MA).

The  CHMP  in  making  this recommendation  has  taken  into  consideration  that  comprehensive information  on  clinical  safety  and  efficacy  have  now  been  provided  and  that  specific  procedures  in particular concerning safety are no longer required such that the grounds to maintain the licence under exceptional circumstances are no longer considered to apply. In  addition  the  CHMP,  having  reviewed  all  relevant  clinical  data  within  the  context  of  Article  21  of Commission  Regulation  (EC)  1234/2008,  considers  that  adequate  information  has  been  supplied  to recommend a change of the indication outside of the restricted clinical setting of a pandemic and that the  temporary  and  exceptional  nature  concerning  the  approval  of  the  variation  introducing  the pandemic strain change no longer applies. As a result of the above the recommended indication now reads as follows: Prophylaxis of influenza caused by A(H1N1) 2009 virus (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). Pandemrix should be used in accordance with Official Guidance thus allowing for further use of vaccine within the EU regardless of whether or not the current WHO pandemic phase is maintained or altered during the coming year. (see section III.3 for more details). II BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Pandemrix  is  an  egg-based  adjuvanted  inactivated  monovalent  H1N1v  split  influenza  vaccine, adjuvanted with AS03, which is composed of squalene, DLα -tocopherol and polysorbate 80. The CHMP recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation for Pandemrix under exceptional circumstances, because at the time point of authorisation the stage of knowledge of comprehensive scientific  information  required  for  the  vaccine  containing  the  actual  pandemic  strain  could  not  be gathered. Medicinal product no longer authorised

This  implied  that,  pursuant  to  article  14  (8)  of  regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004,  the  Marketing Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  committed  to  complete  ongoing  studies,  or  to  conduct  new  studies,  as listed under Specific Obligations (SOBs) in Annex II.C of the MA. Therefore, the recommendation to grant  the  MA  under  exceptional  circumstances  was  made  on  the  basis  of  the  MAH  undertaking  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

submit  the  Specific  Obligations  (SOBs)  and  Follow-up  Measures  (FUMs)  listed  in  the  Letter  of Undertaking dated 19 February 2008.

The initial indication for use of Pandemrix (H5N1) was as follows:

'Prophylaxis  of  influenza  in  an  officially  declared  pandemic  situation.  Pandemrix  should  be  used  in accordance with official guidance.'

Following the onset of the (H1N1)v pandemic and the declaration of WHO Phase 6 in June 2009, the MAH  applied  for  a  variation  PU/0017  to  change  the  pandemic  vaccine  strain  composition  from A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) like strain (NIBRG-14) to A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) strain used NYMC X-179A. The recommendation for the approval of the PU/0017 Pandemic Update was adopted by the CHMP on 24 September 2009. The marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances for the current (H1N1)v vaccine was updated accordingly by the European Commission on 29 September 2009

The revised indication for use of Pandemrix (H1N1) was as follows: 'Prophylaxis  of  influenza  in  an  officially  declared  pandemic  situation  (see  sections  4.2  and  5.1). Pandemic influenza vaccine should be used in accordance with Official Guidance.' The  strain  change  recommendation  from  A(H5N1)  to  (H1N1)v  was  made  on  the  basis  of  the  MAH undertaking further Specific Obligations (SOBs) for Pandemrix (H1N1) which covered for the 2 SOBs previously adopted as well as additional Follow-up Measures (FUMs) that were listed in the Letter of Undertaking dated 24 September 2009. It should be noted that at time of the variation to include the (H1N1)v strain in the A(H5N1) mock-up vaccine, the CHMP was confronted with an unprecedented situation to recommend the authorisation of a vaccine to be used in a mass vaccination campaign with limited data in accordance with Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1085/2004 (repealed by Article 21 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008). Therefore at that time CHMP identified a series of Specific Obligations to be addressed by MAH. It  should  also  be  noted  that  some  of  these  measures  exceeded  the  standard  pre-authorisation requirements established for influenza and other vaccines but in the unprecedented circumstances of the Pandemic were considered necessary from a public health perspective. The  application  for  a  change  of  the  status  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  outside  the  scope  of  Art. 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 was received on 16 April 2010 and contained: - Listings of SOBs and FUMs for which full or partial responses have been made to date - Listing of variations completed and ongoing to date - List of outstanding issues in a revised Letter of Undertaking. -  The  latest  Product  Information  (from  the  last  Opinion/CD).  The  proposed  changes  related  to  the change in status of the MA were also included in the submission Medicinal product no longer authorised

This re-assessment of the benefit risk of Pandemrix has reviewed the status of fulfilment of the original and additional SOBs/FUMs based on the extensive experience gained during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.

## III SCIENTIFIC DATA PROVIDED BY THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER SINCE THE GRANTING OF THE MA UNDER EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES

III.1 List of all Specific Obligations and Follow-up measures submitted since the granting of the MA under exceptional circumstances

In  light  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  under  exceptional  circumstances  in  the  EU  and  pursuant  to Article  14(8)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  the  MAH  agreed  to  provide  CHMP  with  responses  to Specific Obligations (SOBs). These have been addressed as follows: III.1.1. SOBs At the time of approval of the change to include the pandemic strain Specific Obligations required data on immunogenicity and safety collected during clinical trials as well as safety and effectiveness data during routine use. Clinical SOBs The clinical SOBs concerned the reporting of safety and immunogenicity data from sponsored clinical studies with the pandemic vaccine and required reporting of post-dose 1 (PD1) and post-dose 2 (PD2) data  (with  or  without  longer-term  follow-up  and  responses  to  further  doses,  according  to  individual protocols) from the ongoing and planned studies that were listed in the Letter of Undertaking agreed at the time of the strain change variation. In many cases the data required to address these SOBs were provided directly as variations (see next section on variations for details) so that relevant information could be inserted into the SmPC. The  status  of  the  SOBs  regarding  the  D-Pan-H1N1  (Pandemrix)  series  of  studies  can  be  briefly summarised as follows (if filed as variations the reference numbers are shown in brackets): Medicinal product no longer authorised

## SOB/048 Study H1N1-021 PD1 (PU/0017) and PD2:

An abridged report (post dose-1 data) from study H1N1-021 was submitted during the Rolling Review of the variation to include the A(H1N1)v strain (PU/0017). This observer-blinded study was carried out in three centres in Germany to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a two-dose schedule of the A/California/7/2009  (H1N1)v-like  candidate  vaccine  adjuvanted  with  AS03  in  adults  aged  18  to  60 years. The study compared the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine to a non adjuvanted vaccine containing 15 μ g haemagglutinin (HA) from the same strain.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study enrolled 130 subjects and they all received the first dose of vaccine. Before the vaccination, the percentage of seropositive subjects was higher in younger age stratum (44.6% in the 18-40 years group  and  29%  in  51-60  years).  The  proportion  of  subjects  seropositive  before  vaccination  did  not differ between group A (H1N1 AS03 adjuvanted vaccine) and group B (H1N1 plain vaccine).

At  Day  21  the  haemagglutination  inhibition  (HI)  seroconversion  rate  (SCR)  observed  in  the  H1N1 +AS03 group was 98.4%. Seroconversion factor (SCF) and seroprotection rate (SPR) were 41.4 and 98.4%, respectively. In the H1N1 (unadjuvanted) group, the SCR was 95.5%, the SCF was 41.4 and the SPR was 97.0%. The CHMP criteria were met in both age strata (18-40 years and 41-60 years) with no appreciable differences between the age strata.

## SOB/049 Study  H1N1-021  microneutralisation  (MN)  assay  for  neutralising  antibody (NA)

The  HI  immune  responses  observed  at  Day  21  were  comparable  between  treatment  groups,  which demonstrated  the  antigen-sparing  capacity  of  the  AS03A-adjuvanted  vaccine.  There  was  further  no impact of prior seasonal vaccination or baseline serostatus on the HI GMTs observed. The CHMP considered that it was important to include these preliminary data in the SPC at the time of the strain change (PU/0017) to indicate that a single dose may be sufficient in adults. Solicited  local  and  general  symptoms  were  reported  more  frequently  in  the  H1N1  +  AS03A  group compared to the H1N1 group after the first and the second doses. However, the overall reporting rates did not increase after the second dose compared to the first dose of either vaccine. The vast majority of these symptoms were considered to be vaccine-related. The post dose 2 data showed  that there is little or no increment in GMT after the second dose of unadjuvanted  vaccine.  There  were  increments  in  GMTs  with  the  second  dose  of  AS03-adjuvanted vaccine that tended to be greater in magnitude in the older age sub-cohorts. Nevertheless the 95% CI around the post-dose 1 and 2 GMTs and SCFs overlapped and there was no discernible effect on the SPRs and SCRs since they were already so very high after the first dose. The safety  profile  of  the  AS03-adjuvnated  vaccine  was  as  expected  in  this  study  and  did  not  show increased Reactogenicity after the second dose compared to the first dose. The product information was updated to reflect the post-dose 1 data from this study within PU/017. This SOB can now be considered fulfilled. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In addressing this SOB the MAH summarised the status of all the NA data available at the time of the submission of this SOB.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition to the new NA data post-dose 1 in study H1N1-021 the MAH included the following data ain this submission:

Post-dose  1  NA  data  from  study  H1N1-009  in  children  aged  &lt;  3  years.  These  data  were  already submitted and have been reviewed in variation II/024 and

Post-dose  1  NA  data  from  study  H1N1-007  in  adults  aged  from  18-60  years.  These  data  were  not previously  submitted  but  have  been  included  in  the  assessment  report  on  the  concurrent  variation II/032 regarding post-dose 2 HI and safety from study 007.

Since the MAH's laboratory was still in the course of developing and validating an appropriate method to measure NA against the H1N1v strain, the post-dose 1 sera from studies H1N1-021, H1N1-009 and H1N1-007 were tested by three different external laboratories: 1) Samples from D-Pan H1N1-021 have been sent to CDC, R&amp;D laboratory (Dr. R. Donis) 2) Samples from D-Pan H1N1-009 have been sent to CDC reference laboratory (Dr. J. Katz) 3) Samples from D-Pan H1N1-007 have been sent to Viroclinics (NL) The CHMP considered that the data cannot be compared across studies or with previously reported data  from  H5N1  studies  due  to  the  fact  that  sera  from  these  studies  were  sent  to  three  different laboratories, each with its own assay methodology, for MN testing. Nevertheless,  the  results  show  that  a  substantial  increase  in  MN  titres  was  observed  following vaccination with one dose of D-Pan H1N1 adjuvanted vaccine. The data from study D-Pan H1N1-007 show a further response to a second dose. In the two studies for which the NA GMTs could be calculated (D-Pan H1N1-009 and D-Pan H1N1-007), these titres were in absolute terms lower than the HI titres obtained by the MAH but the NA responses generally paralleled the HI responses in terms of trends and increases. Since  three  independent  laboratories  have  demonstrated  that  the  first  dose  of  Pandemrix  (H1N1) elicits a NA response against closely related H1N1 strains the data provide some external validation of the HI responses reported by the MAH. The higher amplitude of the response observed in the MAH's HI assay when compared to the responses obtained in the MN assays underlines the general problems with the large variability in assays for antibody using HI and MN. Medicinal product no longer authorised

SOB-049 can be considered fulfilled as appropriate data have been provided. The MAH was however requested to continue to update CHMP on progress made on developing a fully validated MN assay either in-house or in a contracted facility and to report any additional NA data as FUMs

The CHMP further agreed that there were no implications for the SPC based on these data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## SOB/050 Study H1N1-007 PD1 (II/019) and PD2 (II/032); adults 18-60

The CHMP considered that the post dose 1 data from study H1N1- 007 submitted for variation II/019 were in keeping with the results of study H1N1- 021 in which the vaccine used contained a slightly higher amount of HA and was included as preliminary data in the SPC for Pandemrix at the time of the granting  of  the  pandemic  strain  variation  (PU-017).  Based  on  the  data  from  study  H1N1-007  the previous SPC advice regarding the possibility of using a single dose in adults aged from 18-60 years was supported.

The  CHMP  took  into  account  that  the  baseline  serostatus  of  the  subjects  in  study  H1N1-007  was generally  comparable  with  that  observed  in  the  subjects  in  study  H1N1-021  (post  day  21  results assessed within the pandemic strain variation PU-017) and that, although there was some difference in HI  GMTs according to baseline  serostatus,  especially  in  the  older  subjects,  there  was  no  impact  on satisfaction of the CHMP criteria. The PD2 data submitted in II/032 showed that there was a clear increment in GMT from D21 to D42 in the  adjuvanted  vaccine  group  only  and  GMTs  after  each  dose  showed  a  trend  to  decrease  with increasing age. The findings were consistent with those reported after the second dose in study H1N1021 (using a higher dose of HA) as already reported in the assessment of FU2.020. The  limited  NA  data  available  from  a  subset  of  subjects  and  derived  from  an  assay  performed  at Viroclinics  showed  a  baseline  imbalance  in  seropositivity  rates.  Responses  appeared  to  be  generally greater in the AS03 group, including the results by age strata although the responses in the 8 subjects aged 41-50 years were somewhat anomalous. These results must be viewed with some caution but they do demonstrate a good increment in NA titres in the AS03 group after one dose and overall a further increment after the second dose. The report to D42 from study 007 also indicates that the CD4 T-cell response observed 21 days after dose  2  was  higher  in  the  H1N1  +  AS03A  group  compared  to  the  H1N1  group  and  there  were increments from D21 to D42 in the adjuvanted vaccine group regardless of the mode of testing. As observed in the H5N1 studies, there was no effect of vaccination on the CD8 response but this issue has been explored and discussed previously and will not be revisited specifically with regard to H1N1. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The safety profile described with Pandemrix H1N1 in study 007 was generally comparable with that observed  after  first  and  second  doses  in  study  021,  supporting  the  previous  conclusions  that  the presence of the adjuvant is much more influential than the HA content in terms of the reactogenicity profile.  However,  in  study  021  there  was  no  consistent  trend  for  higher  rates  of  reporting  solicited general symptoms after the second dose although this was observed in study 007 for most symptoms.

As post-dose 1 and post -dose 2 data have been assessed this SOB can now be considered fulfilled.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## SOB/051 Study H1N1-008 PD1 (II/023) and PD2 ((II/038 - under assessment); adults including elderly

This  initial  and  abridged  study  report  described  the  preliminary  safety  and  immunogenicity  results following vaccination with Pandemrix (i.e. 3.75 µg HA +AS03A) in adults aged from 18-60 years and over 60 years, with a good representation of subjects aged &gt; 60 years (120) of which 45 were &gt; 70 years although only five of these 45 subjects were aged &gt; 80 years.

Based on the HI data at baseline the pre-vaccination seropositivity rates and seroprotection rates were in keeping with those observed in studies 021 and 007 in subjects aged 18-60 years. There was no clear trend to higher baseline rates with increasing age. The CHMP criteria for HI responses were met in the initial analysis in the strata &lt; 60 and &gt; 60 years. The additional analyses by baseline serostatus, prior seasonal vaccination and detailed age strata also showed that in each analysis the three criteria were met, including the five subjects aged &gt; 80 years, three of whom were seronegative at baseline. The  safety  profile  of  Pandemrix  H1N1  appeared  to  be  similar  to  previously  assessed  studies  (H1N1 021, H1N1-007) generally comparable with that reported with Pandemrix H5N1 in adults aged 18-60 years and in older subjects, in whom reporting rates were generally lower than in the younger cohort. There were no new safety issues raised by these data. The new data in the elderly merited a cautious reflection in the SPC to allow the option of a single dose. It remains to be confirmed if it is possible to allow this even in those aged &gt; 80 years based on the very limited data in this age group. It is clear from the data that GMTs decreased with age, as observed on previous studies with H5N1 and within the 18-60 years cohort with H1N1v versions of Pandemrix. However,  and  in  contrast  to  the  experience  in  this  age  group  with  H5N1  vaccine,  all  five  subjects mounted an immune response. None of  the  five  was  seroprotected  at  baseline,  although  two  were seropositive, but all were seropositive at D21 and four of the five were seroprotected. On this basis there does not seem to be any justification for setting an upper limit on the age at which a single dose may be an option, however the limitations of the data need to be taken into consideration (as reflected in section 5.1 of the SPC). Medicinal product no longer authorised

The immediate HI response to Pandemrix was considered highly satisfactory in adults, including the elderly, which confirmed the main recommendation to use one dose in this population. To establish if there  could  however  be  any  advantages  for  a  second  dose  in  terms  of  antibody  persistence  and antibody against potential future drifted variants, the CHMP considered that the outstanding post-dose 1 NA data, the post-dose 2 HI and NA data and the antibody persistence data from this study should be pursued as FUMs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As post-dose 1 data have now been assessed and further data will be followed up in variations (II-38) and FUMs, this SOB can now be considered fulfilled.

## SOB/052 H1N1-020 PD1 (II/034); PD2 awaited 7/5/2010; Effect of sequential Fluarix

At 21 days after a first dose of Pandemrix (H1N1) all CHMP and CBER regulatory acceptance criteria were met regardless of whether or not Fluarix had been given three weeks previously. This conclusion also applied within each of the age cohorts 61-70 years, 71-80 years and over 80 years. There was a detectable  effect  of  prior  Fluarix  vaccination  in  terms  of  lower  SCRs,  SCFs  and  SPRs  at  D21  in  the group that had received Fluarix compared to the group that had received Placebo at D-21. The 95% CI did not overlap for the SCRs and SCFs but did overlap for the SPRs. The same pattern was seen in each of the age cohorts 61-70 and 71-80 years. There were too few subjects aged &gt; 80 years (and 5/6 were seropositive against H1N1v at D-21) for any conclusions to be drawn regarding any effect of prior Fluarix on responses to Pandemrix (H1N1). The reactogenicity profile was comparable to that seen in other studies conducted in adults of this age group and there was no effect of prior Fluarix on the reactogenicity of Pandemrix (H1N1). Overall, and despite  the  pattern  of  immune  responses  observed,  the  data  suggest  that  there  is  unlikely  to  be  a clinically important effect of prior vaccination with non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines on the safety or immunogenicity of Pandemrix in subjects aged &gt; 60 years. This available data from this study submitted in fulfilment of this specific obligation allowed to conclude that  sequential  administration  of  Pandemrix  following  the  seasonal  influenza  vaccine  Fluarix  did  not lead to any clinically relevant effect in respect to single administration of Pandemrix. The CHMP agreed that additional data awaited on PD2 can be pursued in the form of a FUM, as a one dose schedule for this population can now considered to be most appropriate. SOB/053 H1N1-018 PD1 (II/025) and PD2; effect of co-administration with Fluarix Medicinal product no longer authorised

The abridged study report submitted for II/025 described the preliminary safety and immunogenicity results  following  vaccination  with  Pandemrix  H1N1  (i.e.  3.75  µg  HA  +AS03A)  coadministered  either with  Fluarix  (F-PAN  group)  or  with  saline  (PAN-F  group)  in  adults  aged  &gt;60  years,  with  a  good representation of subjects aged 61-70 years (112) and 56 subjects &gt;70 years. The oldest subject was 85 years.

On assessment of the immunogenicity of Pandemrix H1N1  (whether administered alone or coadministered with Fluarix) the HI data at baseline, the pre-vaccination seropositivity rates and D21 seroprotection rates were in keeping with those observed in study H1N1-008 in those aged &gt;60 years. The CHMP criteria for HI responses were met in the initial analysis in the strata 61-70 years and &gt;70

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

yrs.  The  additional  analyses  by  baseline  serostatus,  prior  seasonal  vaccination  and  age  strata  also showed that in each analysis the three criteria were comfortably met for H1N1.

Further analyses of the data from five subjects aged &gt; 80 years of age and a breakdown of safety into the  two  age  groups  (61-70  and  &gt;  70  years)  for  study  018  were  provided.  These  showed  that  the immunogenicity of Pandemrix in subjects aged &gt; 80 resulted in all seroprotected at D21 compared to only one at baseline and the SCR and SCF CHMP criteria were also met. These data supplement and agree with the results reported from five subjects aged &gt; 80 years in study 008 (see II/023) and do not suggest any interference from co-administration with Fluarix.

The  safety  profile  of  the  first  dose  of  Pandemrix  H1N1  when  co-administered  with  Fluarix  was comparable  to  that  seen  with  Pandemrix  H1N1  (with  saline  placebo),  and  also  appeared  to  be comparable with that reported in study 008 in the older age groups. No difference in the safety profile of Pandemrix H1N1 was seen between the two vaccine groups. This suggests that co-administration of Pandemrix with Fluarix has a similar safety profile (local and systemic, solicited and unsolicited) to that seen with Pandemrix H1N1 vaccination alone. Overall, there were no new safety issues raised by these data.

Responses to Fluarix were considered difficult to interpret in this small number of elderly subjects due to the baseline seropositivity rates. However in study 018 the responses to Fluarix in the entire age cohort &gt;70 years met the minimal CHMP criteria for seasonal influenza vaccines. The co-administration of Fluarix did not impact on the immunogenicity of Pandemrix H1N1. For Fluarix the responses passed minimal CHMP criteria for seasonal influenza vaccine in this age group. The MAH provided safety data divided  into  age  groups  (61-70  years  and  &gt;70  years).  The  data  show  that  local  reactions  occurred much  more  often  at  the  Pandemrix  injection  site  compared  to  the  Fluarix  injection  site,  as  was expected from all previous experience with AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccines. The rates for local and systemic reactions tend to be lower in those &gt;70 years and Grade 3 reactions occurred in only two subjects. There was a relatively modest increment in HI immune responses after the second dose of Pandemrix. In contrast to the observations at D21, which suggested slightly better responses when the first dose of Pandemrix was given alone on D0, the overall data showed no difference between the groups that received first  Fluarix  and  then  Pandemrix  (F-PAN)  and  the  groups  that  received  the  vaccines  in  the opposite  order  (PAN-F)  for  HI  responses  to  the  pandemic  vaccine  strain  at  D42.  However,  the  SPC recommends only a single dose of Pandemrix in this age group (see variation II/023 based on study 008) so that the D42 results are not as relevant as the D21 data. The  additional  analyses  by  age  strata  and  baseline  serostatus  showed  that  the  increments  in  HI responses to Pandemrix after the second dose reflected the data for subgroups that were seronegative at baseline. HI responses to Pandemrix were comparable between vaccine groups regardless of vaccine history in terms of SPRs and SCRs while the SCFs tended to be larger in the groups without a history. All values in the various sub-groups exceeded the CHMP criteria. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As noted at D21 co-administration of Pandemrix with Fluarix did not have an unfavourable effect on the overall safety profile when compared with co-administration of Pandemrix with placebo. However, there  was  a  consistent  trend  to  higher  rates  of  local  symptoms  at  the  Pandemrix  site  in  the  PAN-F group and some general symptoms were also reported more often in this group. Despite these findings the reporting rates for local and general symptoms did not show a consistent trend to higher rates with the second dose and rates of local symptoms rates were lower after the second dose. There was also some suggestion that local reactions were more common at the Fluarix site in the PAN-F group.

Overall, the data suggest that co-administration of Pandemrix with Fluarix was best accomplished at the time of the first dose of Pandemrix. Also, as concluded in variation II-023, the data suggest that co-administration of Pandemrix with Fluarix provides satisfactory responses to both vaccines. It should be noted that in this study all doses of Fluarix were co-administered with a dose of Pandemrix and therefore it is not possible to assess any possible effect of co-administration per se on responses to the seasonal vaccine strains. As post-dose 1 and 2 data have now been assessed, this SOB can now be considered fulfilled. SOB/055 Study H1N1-017 PD1 and PD2; Pandemrix compared to Arepanrix This  data  has  been  assessed  for  the  MA  for  Arepanrix  (see  EPAR/CHMP  Assessment  Report  for Arepanrix) and is currently being assessed for Pandemrix. As  adult  PD1  and  PD-2  data  for  Pandemrix  from  other  studies  have  already  been  assessed  (see above), this SOB can now be considered not relevant for Pandemrix anymore Any submissions from this study can therefore be handled as FUMs. SOB/056 H1N1-009  PD1  (II/024)  and  PD2  (II/028);  half  and  full  doses  from  some cohorts  in  children  aged  6-35  months;  further  cleaned  data  are  awaited  on 30/4/2010 Post-dose 1 results Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  abridged  study  report  described  the  preliminary  safety  and  immunogenicity  results  following vaccination with one half of the adult dose of Pandemrix (i.e. 1.9 µg HA +AS03B) in 51 children aged

6-35 months. The safety and HI immune response data have been reported according to the three predefined age strata with 17 subjects per stratum.

Based on the HI data three subjects, all in the 6-11 month age stratum, were seropositive at baseline (two of the three were seroprotected). The most likely (but not the only possible) explanation for their baseline serostatus is the persistence of maternal antibody. Details of the immune responses in this

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

age group for the three seropositive subjects and the 14 seronegative subjects showed that each of these three subjects had a measurable HI response based on the shift in minimum GMT observed and all three were seroprotected at D21.

Therefore, if some children in this age group still have some maternal antibody that reacts with H1N1v in HI assays they still show measurable responses to vaccination. The CHMP highlighted that there are currently no established CHMP criteria for the interpretation of immune responses to influenza vaccines in children. It is not likely that HI titres alone can wholly explain the degree of protection observed and it is not proven that a direct extrapolation of criteria from adults to children is possible. Despite these uncertainties, all the 50 children with Day 21 HI data were 'seroprotected', the seroconversion rates were at least 94% and the seroconversion factors were at least 44. The GMT was numerically but not significantly lower in the oldest age stratum but this had no detectable effect on meeting the three criteria (SPR, SCR and SCF). The reverse cumulative distributions by age cohort will be provided and compared when the MAH reports the D42 data. However, it is clear from the GMTs that the majority of children must have achieved HI titres considerably in excess of 1:40.

Thus the D21 HI data suggest that a single administration of half the adult dose may be sufficient for healthy  children  in  the  age  group  6-35  months.  In  contrast,  and  as  observed  in  older  children  and adults, the data with the corresponding H5N1 vaccine clearly showed that two half or full adult doses (according to age) were needed to achieve the sort of HI responses reported with a single half adult dose of H1N1v vaccine in study H1N1-009. In this regard the assessor notes that in a published study with  half  the  adult  dose  of  an  adjuvanted  seasonal  influenza  vaccine  (Fluad)  in  children  aged  6-35 months  the  seroprotection  rate  to  the  H1N1  seasonal  strain  after  one  dose  was  from  40-65%  in various  age  sub-groups.  There  are  no  such  data  in  this  age  group  with  the  experimental  AS03adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine that might help put the results into perspective. The limited post-dose 1 NA data CDC support a conclusion that there is a good response to a first half adult dose but likely leave room for a marked increment in NA also to occur after a second dose. The safety profile of a single half adult dose of Pandemrix H1N1 appeared to be generally comparable with  that  reported  with  Pandemrix  H5N1  in  older  children  (aged  3-9  years)  although  redness  and swelling appeared to be very common in children aged 12-23 months. General symptoms were most often reported in those aged &lt; 12 months but only one (irritability lasting one day) was of Grade 3. In addition, in a population that was not apparently given prophylactic antipyretic medication the per subject rates of any fever were &lt; 20%, only three had a fever above 380°C and none had a fever above 390°C. Therefore the tolerability of a single half-adult dose was considered acceptable. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Post-Dose-2 results:

The HI data after each half adult dose submitted for variation II/28 demonstrated a marked immune response  to  the  second  dose  in  terms  of  increments  in  GMTs  in  each  of  the  three  age  strata.  The available data are insufficient to indicate whether a single half adult dose in this age group would be sufficient but this hypothesis cannot be ruled out.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  available  data  clearly  indicate  increased  reactogenicity  with  the  second  half  adult  dose  of Pandemrix H1N1 in children aged 6-35 months but the major concern is the increase in rate of fever, including Grade 2/3 fever, with the second dose. The post-dose 2 findings were unexpected based on the  observations  made  in  3-5  year-old  children  who  received  H5N1/AS03  vaccine  in  the  previously reported study. Post-marketing data seem to confirm that fevers are very common after the second dose. Fever also seems to occur commonly or very commonly after the first dose and febrile convulsion has been reported even after the first dose. However, the MAH's assessment suggests that the rate of febrile convulsion may not be unusually high.

Children aged 6-35 months mounted a good immune response to the first half adult dose based on HI and NA data available. It is not known at this time whether the increment in HI antibody observed after the second half adult dose will confer added protection. However, the new safety data post dose 2 throw some doubt on the benefit-risk relationship for a second dose. At this time the CHMP proposed that SPC section 4.2 should reflect the data, with appropriate cross references, to leave the selection of one or two half adult doses in this age group open. Although the option to give a second dose was still maintained, the SPC was updated in II/028 to state that the option  to  administer  a  second  dose  should  take  into  consideration  the  safety  and  immunogenicity information provided in the SPC sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. As post-dose 1 and post -dose 2 data have been assessed this SOB can now be considered fulfilled. SOB/057 H1N1-010  PD1  in  children  3-17  years  (II/032  and  II/033);  PD2  awaited 30/4/2010 Overall the HI responses to a single adult dose in subjects aged 10-17 years generally resemble those in young adults. In addition, in the table proposed in section 5.1 of the SPC the MAH showed the HI responses separately for children aged 10-17 years who were seronegative at baseline. As expected, these data show satisfactory responses in this subset that far exceeded the CHMP criteria applied to adults. In addition, the safety profile of the first and second adult doses in subjects aged 10-17 years was generally comparable with that observed after each dose in young adults. In subjects aged 10-17 years  there  were  increments  in  local  as  well  as  general  solicited  symptoms  with  the  second  dose compared to the first dose whereas in young adults general symptoms increased with the second dose. Medicinal product no longer authorised

On this basis the CHMP considered that the SPC should continue to recommend a single adult dose from 10 years upwards.

As  post-dose  1  data  have  been  assessed  and  post-dose-2  data  were  considered  of  less  relevance, given  the  main  recommendation  of  a  single  dose,  this  SOB  can  now  be  considered  fulfilled  and subsequent submissions can be handled as FUMs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## SOB/058 H1N1-023  PD1  half  dose  in  children  3-17  years  (II/033);  PD2  awaited 30/4/2010

In the 10-17 years age group the HI data from study 023 suggest that a single half adult dose might be sufficient.  However, the MAH considers that the benefit for a half vs. full adult dose in terms of adverse  reactions  is  limited  and  therefore  proposes  to  maintain  the  current  recommendation  for  a single  full  adult  dose  at  least  until  such  time  that  more  data  are  available  (i.e.  microneutralisation assay results, persistence results and heterologous immune response data).

In the 3-9 years age group the HI data from study 023 also suggest that a single half adult dose might be  sufficient  although  the  absence  of  additional  serological  data  limits  the  confidence  that  can  be placed in the results. Nevertheless, the data lend support to the current dose recommendation in the SPC for this age group, which was made on grounds of caution following the reactogenicity observed after the second half adult dose in children aged 6-35 months in study H1N1-009 (variation II/028) and also taking into account the safety of the first adult dose in children aged 3-9 years reported from study 010. On these grounds, the post-dose 2 safety data from study 023 will be revealing since they may or may not confirm that reactogenicity in children aged 3-9 years is higher after the second half adult dose as was seen in children aged 6-35 months. Meanwhile, with higher GMTs after a full adult dose in study 010 vs a half adult dose in study 023 in this age group it should be noted that the post-dose 1 rates of local reactions were higher for children aged 3-5 and 6-9 years in study 010 vs study 023 and that rates of general reactions were higher in study  010  for  the  6-9  years  stratum.  Overall,  the  CHMP  did  not  consider  that  current  evidence indicates any merit in changing the dose recommendations for children aged 3-9 years. The baseline seropositivity rates in study 023 were low in children aged 3-9 years despite the fact that about half had received prior seasonal influenza vaccination. However, it cannot be ruled out that a proportion of these children could have been primed even though they had no detectable HI at D0. The submission does not provide the HI responses according to influenza vaccination history In particular the GMTs and SCFs are required since the SPRs and SCRs were anyway at or near 100%. The assessor considers that these tabulations should be provided before reaching a final opinion on this variation in order to confirm that the results at D21 may be extrapolated to other populations with much lower prior exposure to seasonal vaccination. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In terms of safety the data indicate that a first adult dose of Pandemrix H1N1 results in approximately the  same  safety  profile  between  children  aged  10-17  years  and  young  adults.  The  data  raise  no particular concerns in this age group.

In the children aged 3-9 years the safety profile associated with a first adult dose could be considered acceptable. However, the second dose is clearly much more reactogenic and results in much higher rates  of  fevers.  In  this  context  it  should  be  noted  that  some  of  the  spontaneous  reports  of  febrile convulsion have occurred in children aged 5-6 years. Therefore the safety profile would not preclude the option of a single adult dose in this age group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As  post-dose  1  data  have  been  assessed  and  post-dose-2  data  were  considered  of  less  relevance, given  the  main  recommendation  of  a  single  half  dose  in  this  population,  this  SOB  can  now  be considered fulfilled and subsequent submissions can be handled as FUMs.

## SOB/070 H1N1-024 PD1 modified process vaccine; PD2 currently under assessment

The statistical tabulations received on the D21 HI data did not indicate any important differences in immune  responses  to  Pandemrix  H1N1  manufactured  according  to  the  initial  process  and  the  new (Triton) process.

It  should  be  noted  that  since  this  SOB  was  formulated  the  PDCO  has  agreed  that  companies  could request  a  waiver  for  this  population.  In  addition  the  MAH  notified  the  CHMP  that  due  to  very  low enrolment the study was to be terminated. A report is expected on the limited data available. The CHMP agreed that this SOB should be converted to a FUM concerning provision of the limited data obtained.

The findings support the  prior  approval  of  variation  II/018  to  change  the  manufacturing  process.  It should be noted that there are no safety data have been assessed as yet. There were no implications for the SPC based on these HI data. As post-dose 1 data have been assessed and as there were no implications for the SPC based on this data  this  SOB  can  now  be  considered  fulfilled  and  any  subsequent  submissions  can  be  handled  as FUMs. SOB/073 H1N1-021 neutralising antibody data.

## SOB/060

This concerns collection of vaccine effectiveness data.  In fulfilment of this SOB the protocol has been submitted and agreed upon by CHMP and the study is ongoing.

It should be noted that the CHMP in 2003 foresaw the need for effectiveness data, in the context of the development of mock-up vaccines to be used in a pandemic situation. It should also be acknowledged that  this  goes  beyond  standard  requirements  for  seasonal  influenza  and  certain  other  vaccines, whereby  immunogenicity  data  serves  as  a  surrogate  marker  of  efficacy  for  the  assessment  of  the initial  authorisation  and  clinical  data  on  effectiveness    is  collected  in  the  post  marketing  phase.  The approach  taken  for  the  pandemic  vaccines  was  at  the  time  considered  to  be  appropriate  in consideration of all the uncertainties to be faced in a Pandemic context e.g. the virulence of the agent concerned, use in naive population sub-groups and anticipated high morbidity and mortality rates etc.

Overall,  the  vaccine  has  shown  to  be  highly  immunogenic  and  besides  this,  reassuring  data  from independent  evaluation  of  field  H1N1  vaccine  effectiveness  (including  Pandemrix)  in  European countries  indicate  that  vaccination  campaigns  have  been  effective.  The  CHMP  considers  further effectiveness data can be collected in the context of a FUM. Pharmacovigilance SOBs It  should  be  noted  that  the  listed  Pharmacovigilance  SOBs  exceed  standard  pre-authorisation requirements for seasonal influenza and other vaccines. SOB/061 This was a commitment to conduct a post authorisation safety study (PASS) in at least 9,000 subjects in  accordance  with  the  RMP.  This  was  carried  out  in  GP  practices  in  England  and  recruitment  was completed  in  December  2009.  Due  to  the  eventual  UK  immunisation  policy,  it  was  not  possible  to achieve the target sample sizes in the age cohorts of 2-23 m, 2-8 y and 9-17 y, however the CHMP considered  that  the  large  amount  of  available  post  marketing  data  in  connection  with  clinical  study data in the paediatric population has provided sufficient information to support the position that the safety database in this population can be considered acceptable. This SOB has been fulfilled as the study was implemented. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The MAH has committed to provide a rolling update on analysis of the uncleaned and preliminary data. In the absence of any clear safety signal arising from the dataset  the study was intended to provide a descriptive analysis of AEs compared to the safety profile documented in the sponsored studies with Pandemrix H5N1 and H1N1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

An  analysis  of  the  near  full  study  cohort  (n=8811  subjects)  with  30-day  follow-up  was  recently completed and a preliminary analysis of partially-cleaned data from the full study cohort (30 day FU) was provided. Overall, 12% of subjects in each age cohort reported an event. There was no evidence of case clusters of potential concern amongst the MedDRA terms reported. Two convulsions and three fatal  events  in  elderly  subjects  with  risk  factors  have  been  reported.  The  7  day  follow-up  in  the reactogenicity  cohort  revealed  relatively  high  rates  of  local  and  general  symptoms  compared  to  the H5N1 and H1N1 clinical studies although these have been in the same frequency categories already stated in the SmPC. Grade 3 local symptoms and those requiring medical attention have occurred at very low rates.

This did not identify safety issues. The final study report (30 day FU) is expected on 30 November 2010 and the 6-month FU report is expected 1 April 2011. Taking into consideration that the protocol has been submitted and agreed by CHMP, that the study is ongoing and that data received to date via interim reports and also safety data generated through post marketing  surveillance  are  extensive  and  reassuring  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  remaining  data from this study can further be pursued as a FUM. It is of note that the requirements for a PASS study goes beyond current standard requirements for safety data for standard seasonal influenza vaccines and was requested in consideration of the exceptional circumstances of a mass vaccination campaign in  the  context  of  a  pandemic  with  an  unknown  epidemiological  development.  Based  on  the  actual epidemiological  development  of  the  2009  H1N1  pandemic  and  having  considered  the  totality  of  the data as described above CHMP considers that any remaining data can be collected in the context of a FUM. SOB/062 This was a commitment to implement a pregnancy registry. At time of the strain change pregnancy registries have been added as SOBs to collect data in this risk group despite the fact that these are not normally  required  pre-authorisation.  In  fulfilment  of  this  SOB  the  protocol  has  been  submitted  and reviewed by the CHMP and the registry has been established. The MAH has provided the details of the UK pregnancy register and committed to provide the results. Overall  from  pharmacovigilance  monitoring  and  data  collected  so  far  no  safety  signal  has  been detected. For discussion of further data in pregnant women see section III.2.3.2 Clinical Safety below. Overall  taking  into  consideration  the  protocol  has  been  submitted  and  agreed  by  CHMP  the  CHMP considered that these data can be pursued as a FUM. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## SOB/063

This  was  a  commitment  to  establish  the  mechanisms  to  promptly  investigate  issues  affecting  the benefit-risk balance of the vaccine. The MAH has established routine and enhanced Pharmacovigilance activities  both  described  in  the  risk  management  plan  and  including  weekly signalling,  evaluation  of signals, monthly S-PSUR. In addition for investigating emerging benefit risk issues after the start of the vaccination campaign the MAH has provided different sources that will be use to investigate issues

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

affecting the benefit risk balance of the vaccine. The method used to analyse the different databases as well as the protocols of the studies have been reviewed and considered acceptable by the CHMP.

This obligation has been fulfilled as the MAH has provided details for a number of data sources that may be useful in evaluating emerging safety issues. These data sources were considered sufficient to fulfil the SOB.

## Conclusion on SOBs

The Specific Obligations concerning the evaluation of safety and effectiveness as introduced during the initial  authorisation  and  the  variation  in  order  to  introduce  the  pandemic  (H1N1)v  strain  have  been sufficiently  addressed  to  conclude  on  the  maintenance  of  a  positive  risk/benefit  for  the  use  of Pandemrix  in  the  current  epidemiological  situation.  The  CHMP  considers  that  the  MAH  has  now provided sufficient comprehensive safety and efficacy data such that grounds to maintain the MA under exceptional circumstances are no longer applicable. In addition specific procedures concerning safety are  no  longer  required  in  context  Article  14  (8)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  as  these  can  be achieved in context of the conventional Risk Management Plan.

## Non-clinical FUMs

## FUM 067

This FUM requested a study to evaluate the possible effects of the adjuvant in the presence of antigen when dosed in early pregnancy. A study was conducted  and The MAH concluded that neither the full vaccine nor the adjuvant alone had an effect on pre-implantation loss.

## FUM 078

This FUM concerned a study of protection against influenza in ferrets. The AS03-adjuvanted vaccine induced  superior  antibody  responses  compared  to  non-adjuvanted  HA,  which  correlated  with  the protection  observed  in  response  to  homologous  influenza  virus  challenge.  The  protection  observed following one dose of adjuvanted vaccine tended to be less than that achieved with two doses.

Clinical FUMs The status of these FUMs can be briefly summarised as follows: Fulfilled: Pandemrix (H5N1) FUMs FUM 017 Study H5N1-002/-030 (D180)/-038 (Years 1, 2 and 3) (consistency &amp; persistency):\"Anti-neuraminidase  antibodies  from  100  subjects  \"Persistence  D180  (-030) \"Booster given at D180 data (-030) The CHMP  considered  that the neuraminidase present in the vaccine elicits functional antineuraminidase antibody as detected by the reference assay method and the results suggest that antineuraminidase antibody  has  some  neutralisation  activity  but  the  contribution  this  may  make  to  the overall protective efficacy of the vaccine is unknown. The MAH does not plan any further testing for anti-neuraminidase antibody because of the lack of a standardised high throughput method and the uncontrolled content of neuraminidase in influenza vaccines. Overall the CHMP agrees with the MAH. Having established that anti-neuraminidase antibody is elicited and makes a variable contribution to the total neutralising activity measured this part of the FUM is considered to be fulfilled. Study H5N1-030 Medicinal product no longer authorised

The Month 6 antibody persistence data showed a seroprotection rate in the HN-AS03 group of 40.2% against A/Vietnam but a negligible rate against A/Indonesia. The question of whether immune memory laid down by pre-pandemic vaccination would be sufficient to prevent pandemic influenza or whether it is necessary to maintain a certain level of circulating antibody cannot be answered. However, the data from study

030 do allow for an assessment of immune memory and support a conclusion that the first two doses of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine efficiently elicited priming. These data are in keeping with those reported

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

from studies 012 and 015 in which response to a heterologous booster strain were also assessed. In addition, the response to a single booster dose in subjects who had previously received adjuvanted vaccine was higher than in the control group at M6 + 21D. This finding is also in keeping with that from study 015.

In  the  subjects  that  initially  received  non-adjuvanted  vaccine,  a  further  increase  in  the  response  to A/Vietnam  and  A/Indonesia  was  observed  at  M6  +  42D  i.e.  following  the  second  dose  of  AS03adjuvanted A/Indonesia vaccine. However, responses were still significantly lower than those observed at  M6  +  21D  in  subjects  primed  with  the  adjuvanted  vaccine.  Hence,  the  use  of  AS03-adjuvanted vaccine for priming and boosting is important.

In  terms  of  safety,  more  grade  3  general  solicited  symptoms  were  observed  after  the  booster  in subjects  primed  with  the  adjuvanted  vaccine  (10.9%)  compared  to  subjects  primed  with  the  nonadjuvanted  vaccine  (4.1%).  However,  rates  for  grade  3  local  reactions  were  low  and  there  was  no difference between groups (5.3% versus 4.1%). The incidence of general symptoms after one booster dose was 78.9% in 030 compared with 64.4% after priming with adjuvanted vaccine in study 002. However, rates for local reactions were comparable (81.9% versus 77.8%). Inevitably the group that had received non-adjuvanted vaccine in study 002 experienced higher rates of local (74.6% versus 17.3%) and general (62.9% versus 37.2 %) symptoms after two booster doses compared to postprimary doses. Following a review of one case of multiple sclerosis (MS), the CHMP further considered that whether or not the use of this vaccine might in some way predispose to the development of MS and/or bring forward the onset of symptoms in those who would eventually develop clinical evidence of the condition must remain under very long-term investigation. No conclusion can be drawn based on one case. The NA data from study 030 and data over years 1-3 are awaited. FUM 018 Study H5N1-008/011 (safety): NA data on the remaining subjects (18-60 years): D42 and D180 The  data  are  in  keeping  with  those  previously  presented.  While  21%  of  subjects  in  the  AS03adjuvanted group had NA titres of at least 1:80 before vaccination 99% reached this titre after two doses of 15µg/ASO3 vaccine (and most reached it after one dose). At D180 71% still had a titre of at least 1:80. The baseline rate of seropositivity against A/Vietnam was comparable with that in study 007 in this  age  group  (1/5-1/3  subjects  were  NA  seropositive  at  baseline,  10-25%  per  group  had  titres  &gt; 1:40 and 2-10% had titres &gt; 1:80). In contrast the majority (82-91% per group) of subjects aged &gt; 60 years in study 008 were NA seropositive before vaccination with 69.5% and 67.3% at 1:40 and 44.6% and 40.0% at 1:80. In the 15 µg HA/AS03 group the percentages with &gt; 1:40 and &gt;1:80 at D21 were 99.4% and 93.8%, respectively. At D42 these percentages were 100% and 99.4%. This FUM was considered fulfilled.

## FUM 019 Study H5N1-007 (dose-range): Extended serological follow-up = pre-boost data (M14) of study H5N1-015

This FUM was fulfilled with the submission of the type II variation (II/04) which was received on 14/11/2008.

## FUM 020 Study H5N1-009 (paediatric) - Initial D42 report

The MAH submitted data to D42 from study H5N1-009 in children aged from 3-9 years.  It was noted that extended follow-up of this study will include assessment of antibody persistence and safety up to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Month 24 after primary vaccination. According to the timelines identified by the MAH, it is expected that these data will be provided at intervals up to June 2011.  Regarding the product information (PI), a variation should be submitted, considering the PI now states \"There is no experience in children\".

The data were considered insufficient to support an unequivocal recommendation for use of the adult dose  in  children  aged  3-17  years,  however  the  CHMP  highlighted  that  it  would  seem  that  some mention of the findings in section 5.1 of the  Pandemrix SPC, to be updated as more data emerge, would be potentially useful in case there should be an urgent need to deploy vaccine before adequate data are available. The D42 data point to the potential advantages of using the adult dose in children aged 3-9 years and, therefore, across the age range 3-17 years.

The further follow-up from this study and responses from the MAH to this FUM were assessed within PU/0017  (see  EPAR/CHMP  AR)  and  formed  the  basis  for  the  recommendation  in  the  use  in  the paediatric indication. FUM 021 Study H5N1-010 (elderly): Initial D42 report, D180 data Extended follow-up (24 months) This  FUM  was  fulfilled  with  submission  of  variation  II/05  received  on 14.11.2008. FUM 022 Study H5N1 -012 (prime-boost): Initial report (including  D180:  pre-  and  post  boost  6  months)  This  FUM  was  fulfilled  with  the submission of the type II variation (II/04) which was received on 14/11/2008. FUM 023 Study H5N1-015 (booster):Initial D42 report, D180 data, This  FUM  was  fulfilled with  the  submission  of  the  type  II  variation  (II/04)  and  variation  (II/06),  which received positive opinion on 29 May 2009 FUM 024 Study report(s) from Q-Pan-001 (half-dose adjuvant). The  MAH  submitted  a  full  amended  clinical  study  report  (CSR)  on  the  D42  data  (safety  and  HI immunogenicity results) from study Q-PAN-001 dated 14 July 2008. The MAH also submitted an annex to the above report dated 18 July 2008, which covers data on safety and HI testing results up to D182. The data from Q-PAN-001 do not raise any major surprises and were consistent with the previous data from studies H5N1-002, H5N1-007 and H5N1-008 with adjuvanted Dresden antigen vaccine containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004. Further data and follow-up from study Q-PAN-001 were assessed within the MAA for Arepanrix. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## FUM 025 The MAH commits to provide the CMI data from studies H5N1-009, -010, -012 and 015

In  the  initial  dossier  the  apparent  difference  between  the  observed  CD4  and  CD8  responses  to vaccination could not be explained. The CSFE-LP test system that has since been applied by the MAH demonstrated  an  expansion  of  memory  CD4+  T  cells  and  CD8+  T  cells  in  the  adjuvanted  vaccine group. However, as pointed out by the MAH, the pattern of results suggests that the detected CD8+ T

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cell  response could possibly represent a bystander effect. Therefore, the MAH repeated the LP-CFSE test after CD4+ T cell depletion in experiments.

Further evaluations of CD4+ T cell responses to vaccination continue to indicate that cross-reactive T cell  responses occur to different H5N1 subtypes. However, some of the response detected with split virions likely represents recognition of antigens other then HA.

In February 2009 the MAH provided the results of the planned continuation of studies using the LPCFSE method after CD4 cell depletion.

In addition, in March 2009, the MAH supplied the CMI data from the Paediatric study 009, which have been included in this report.

In  the  initial  dossier  the  apparent  difference  between  the  observed  CD4  and  CD8  responses  to vaccination could not be explained. The CSFE-LP test system that has since been applied by the MAH demonstrated  an  expansion  of  memory  CD4+  T  cells  and  CD8+  T  cells  in  the  adjuvanted  vaccine group. However, as pointed out by the MAH, the pattern of results suggested that the detected CD8+ T cell response could possibly represent a bystander effect. Therefore, the MAH repeated the LP-CFSE test after CD4+ T cell depletion. The results suggest that much of the CD8+ T cell response may represent a bystander effect i.e. is dependent of the presence of CD4+ cells. The  limited  data  from  the  study  in  children  009  indicate  that  the  findings  are  in  line  with  those reported in adults. The MAH commits to monitor both NA and cellular responses in vaccinees to newer variants of H5N1 that emerge. FUM 026 The MAH commits to provide a specific plan for conduct of studies in which NA titres are determined in sera from vaccinees against more recent H5N1 strains. The MAH has satisfactorily fulfilled this follow-up measure regarding provision of a plan for evaluation of neutralising antibody titres against emerging strains. The FUM should now be converted to request provision of data from any such studies that become possible. FUM 030 The MAH commits to repeat User Testing of the PL using the version finally approved by CHMP and to report these results within 6 months of the approval date. This FUM is closed with the submission of the notification (N/0007) on 02/12/2008. Pandemrix (H1N1) FUMs Medicinal product no longer authorised

FUM 065 'The MAH commits to provide the validation of the haemagglutination inhibition assay.'

The MAH's HI assay is a validated assay based on the original validation document QVALR-PF-015 with every strain change the Company performs a revalidation of the HI assay. The revalidation includes assessment  of  assay  precision  (repeatability  and  reproducibility),  specificity,  linearity  and  stability. Since no international standard serum was available accuracy could not be tested but this will be done once an international standard serum is available. The revalidation was conducted with samples from study  D-Pan-H1N1-021  (subjects  that  have  received  one  dose  of  an  investigational  formulation  of Pandemrix). Samples from Flu-US-007 were used as the negative controls.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  CHMP  considered  that  this  assessment  has  not  provided  all  details  of  the  original  HI  assay validation since this has been in operation for some years and has been reviewed previously.

More important are the results of the revalidation exercise using the A/California/07/2009 strain. This appears to have provided results that were well within the required criteria. It was particularly noted that none of the 150 samples from subjects aged 9-15 months were HI seropositive with respect to the new strain, suggesting that the assay has a good specificity.

## FUM 066 Provision of submission dates for other final study reports.

This FUM is fulfilled as the MAH provided the submission dates. Awaited (from H5N1 mock-up file) FU2 17.2 Study  H5N1-002/-030  (D180)/-038  (Years  1,  2  and  3)  (consistency  &amp;  persistency): Persistence Year 2 (-038), Booster given @ Year 2 data (-038) FU2 17.3 Study  H5N1-002/-030  (D180)/-038  (Years  1,  2  and  3)  (consistency  &amp;  persistency) Persistence Year 3 (-038), Booster given in Year 3 data (-038) FU2 20.2 Study  H5N1-009  (paediatric),  Initial  D42  report,  D180  data,  extended  follow-up (24 Months) FU2 21.2 Study H5N1-010 (elderly), Initial D42 report, D180 data Extended follow-up (24 months) FU2 23.2 Study H5N1-015  (booster), Initial D42  report, D180  data, extended follow-up (24 months) FUM 027 The MAH commits to provide a specific plan for conduct of studies in immunocompromised subjects (overdue) Medicinal product no longer authorised

FUM 039 From II/04, II/05 &amp; II/06 : (expected on an on-going basis) With the derivation of a WHO standard since the HI and NA assays were developed, the MAH should inform CHMP of plans to implement use of the WHO standard prospectively and also whether there will be a selection of older samples re-tested in assays that employ the WHO standard.

## FUM 064 Provision of H5N1-009 final study report

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  CHMP  agreed  that  the  above  outstanding  FUMS  related  to  the  H5N1  mock-up  vaccine  are considered more relevant for Pandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, and are no more requested for Pandemrix (H1N1)v.

## Pharmacovigilance FUMs

## FUM 038

This FUM related to the assessment of two cases of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) observed in Q-Pan H5N1 and D-Pan H5N1 clinical studies. The MAH responded to all requests for information and this FUM has  been  fulfilled  within  PU/0017.  The  available  information  did  not  provide  sufficient  evidence  to support an association between Pandemrix and AIH or other autoimmune disorders. PSU 031, 032, 033, 034, 035, FU2.035, PSU 036 and FU2.036 These are completed following sPSUR submissions and addressing subsequent issues raised. PSU 074, 075 and 076 These PSU commitments concern subsequent sPSURs. FUM 027 This concerns a request to provide a plan to assess the vaccine in immunocompromised subjects. It may  be considered fulfilled in that there is an ongoing assessment of Q-Pan (H1N1)v in immunocompromised subjects in Canada and the MAH will also report data from the study under an Arepanrix FUM, which might be considered supportive. FUM 069 This was fulfilled by filing variation IA/001 to update the DDPS. RMP 028, 029 and 068 These were fulfilled by filing updates to the RMP. These RMPs have been assessed. RMP 077 This concerns provision of a further update to the RMP following PU/0017 Medicinal product no longer authorised

In summary it can be concluded that the current content of the overall safety database far exceeds the safety data base expected before approval of an influenza vaccine. The data available do not raise any specific safety concern and the safety profile is found to be comparable to that of seasonal influenza vaccines.

It  is  considered  that  the  remaining  commitments  for  outstanding  data  related  to  pharmacovigilance could be converted to FUMs.

## III.1.3. Variations

Please consult the separate assessment reports that have already been issued for full details.

Variations already completed are as follows:

Pandemrix H5N1 Quality Variations : II/001, II/009, II/010, II/011, II/012 On 20 November 2008 the CHMP adopted a positive opinion to allow the use an additional filling and packaging  site  for  the  adjuvant  (Variation  II-001),  this  variation  received  a  positive  Commission Decision on 15 December 2008. On 25 June 2009 the CHMP adopted a positive opinion to allow changes to the manufacturing process of  the  H5N1  antigen  (Variations  II-009,  II-010)  these  variations  received  a  positive  Commission Decision on 1 July 2009. On  20  August  2009  the  CHMP  adopted  a  positive  opinion  to  allow  the  use  of  alternative  shipping containers  for  the  active  substance  (Variation  II-011)  and  to  update  the  pharmaceutical  dossier (Variation II-012) these variations received a positive a positive Commission Decision on 8 September 2009. Clinical Variations : II/004, II/005, II/006 On 29 May 2009 the CHMP adopted a positive Opinion on three type II variations based on additional clinical data to update sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1 of the SmPC. Variation  II-004  involved  the  possibility  of  administering  one  dose  of  Pandemrix  after  primary immunisation  with  vaccine  of  the  same  formulation  and  approved  for  pre-pandemic  use  containing H5N1 antigen from a different clade of the same influenza subtype. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Variation II-005 involved use in subjects aged 61 years and above.

Variation II-006 involved  an update of section 5.1 regarding the use of a much longer dose interval for primary vaccination.

These variations received a positive Commission Decision on 10 July 2009.

These  variations  have  received  a  positive  Commission  Decision  between  5  October  2009  and  3 February  2010.  The  submissions  related  to  changes  in  the  manufacturing  process  of  the  active substance, the finished product and the adjuvant. Also further sites were added for the processing of the  active  substance,  finished  product  and  the  adjuvant.  The  variation  application  are  summarised below: II/008 Changes to the manufacture of the adjuvant introduced. II/015 Changes to the storage of the antigen were introduced. II/018 Changes to the manufacturing process of the H1N1 antigen were introduced. II/020 and II/035 Additional sites for manufacture of the antigen finished product were introduced. II/029 An additional site for the manufacture of the antigen was introduced. II/021, II/022, II/027, II/030, II/031, II/036 and II/037 Additional sites for the manufacture and testing of the adjuvant were introduced.

## II/038

All of these variations were filed and completed between 29 September 2010 and the April 2010 CHMP meeting. The data comprised safety and immunogenicity data derived from various clinical studies in subjects  aged  from  6  months  to  &gt;  80  years.  The  status  of  these  SOBs  and  FUMs  can  be  briefly summarised as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## II/019 and II/032

Data from study 007 (PD1 and PD2) in adults aged 18-60 years

II/032 also included data in adolescents from study 010

## II/023 and II/038

Data from study 008 (PD1 and PD2) in adults aged from 18 - &gt; 80 years

II/024 and II/028 Data from study 009 (PD1 and PD2) concerning half and full adult doses in children aged 6-35 months II/033 Data from study 010 (PD1) full dose in children 3-17 years and PD1 data from study 023 half dose in children aged 3-17 years II/025 Data from study 018 (PD1) on the effect of co-administration with Fluarix in adults II/034 Data from study 020 (PD1) on the effect of sequential administration of Fluarix in adults II/026 This  concerned  an  update  to  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  only  to  add  information  gained  from  postmarketing reporting of ADRs The  ongoing  variations  at  the  time  of  requesting  this  switch  to  full  MA  are  II/38  (clinical),  II-39 (quality) and IA/40 as described above.

## III.2.1. Quality

The relevant quality data generated as part of the H5N1 mock-up licence were considered supportive for  the  H1N1v  pandemic  strain  version  of  Pandemrix.  Additional  supporting  quality  data  required

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

specifically  for  the  strain  change  were  provided  22  September  2009 and satisfactorily demonstrated the quality of the vaccine.

Since the pandemic strain change, a number of additional antigen/adjuvant manufacturing sites have been introduced and also the antigen manufacturing process has been amended. There are no quality SOBs  for  the  Pandemrix  dossier.  Those  FUMs  that  remain  to  be  fulfilled  relate  to  the  vaccine manufactured with H5N1 antigen.

The  CHMP  agreed  that  the  outstanding  FUMS  related  to  the  H5N1  mock-up  vaccine  are  considered more relevant for Pandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, and are no more requested for Pandemrix (H1N1)v.

In conclusion, the CHMP considered that from a quality perspective there are no outstanding concerns regarding conversion to a full MA. III.2.2  Non-Clinical The MAH has responded to the two FUMs. The data have been assessed and RSIs were adopted at the April 2010 CHMP meeting. The additional data on efficacy in ferrets will need to be added to section 5.1 of the SmPC by means of a variation that will follow conclusion of the FUM. III.2.3. Clinical The clinical SOBs and FUMs already fulfilled or partly fulfilled are listed in section III.1 The outstanding clinical issues in terms of data that are awaited in response to SOBs or FUMs are listed in Annex II of the Product Information. III.2.3.1 Clinical Pharmacology and Clinical Efficacy The assessment of the expected safety and potential protective efficacy of Pandemrix (H1N1)v was initially  based  on  the  data  obtained  with  the  mock-up  vaccine  containing  H5N1  strains  (either A/Vietnam  or  A/Indonesia)  together  with  very  limited  and  preliminary  data  from  the  first  reported study (021) in adults aged 18-60 years with an early formulation of Pandemrix (H1N1)v. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The available data on the H5N1 mock-up vaccine before it was approved came from three studies in adults,  including  elderly  subjects.  Safety  data  were  available  from  approximately  5000  subjects exposed  to  at  least  the  dose  of  HA/AS03  that  was  approved  and  with  a  substantial  proportion  of vaccinees followed up to at least 6 months.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After  first  approval  the  MAH  provided  data  from  three  additional  studies  with  the  mock-up  vaccine, including a study in the elderly, one in children aged 3-9 years only and one in adults that evaluated priming  with  one  or  two  doses  and  boosting  with  a  version  manufactured  using  H5N1  virus  of  a different clade. The MAH also provided the follow-up data from one of the first three studies in which a third  (booster)  dose  was  given.  All  the  data  with  the  mock-up  vaccine  pointed  to  the  need  for  two priming doses in all age groups. Two half adult doses appeared to be sufficient in children aged 3-9 years. There were no major safety concerns with the second dose except that children aged 3-9 years who  had  received  two  adult  doses  showed  higher  AE  rates  (and  especially  fever)  after  the  second compared to the first dose.

The  data  from  all  the  studies  with  the  mock-up  vaccine  were  reflected  in  the  SmPC  and  PL  for Pandemrix  H5N1.  The  prescribing  information  for  Pandemrix  H5N1  was  then  used  as  the  basis  for drafting the first version of the SmPC and PL for Pandemrix (H1N1)v. In September 2009, just before approval of the strain change variation (PU/II/017) to the mock-up vaccine,  the  MAH  provided  preliminary  data  from  a  study  (H1N1-021)  conducted  with  Pandemrix (H1N1)v  manufactured  using  a  pandemic  virus  strain  approved  by  WHO  and  CHMP  for  vaccine production.  The  antigen  content  in  the  vaccine  was  slightly  higher  than  that  in  the  final  pandemic vaccine  because  a  preliminary  method  for  estimating  the  antigen  content  had  been  used.  The  data were limited to HI responses at 21 days after a single dose. These data indicated that it was very likely that  a  single  dose  might  be  sufficient  for  adults  aged  18-60  years  and  the  results  were  taken  into account in drafting the first approved SmPC and PL for Pandemrix (H1N1)v. The  SOBs  concerning  data  from  sponsored  clinical  studies  with  the  pandemic  vaccine  required reporting of post-dose 1 and post-dose 2 data, with or without longer-term follow-up and responses to further  doses  (according  to  individual  protocols),  from  the  ongoing  and  planned  studies  that  were listed in the Letter of Undertaking agreed at the time of the strain change variation. In summary, the data have confirmed that a single adult dose is suitable for subjects aged from 10 years  upwards  (including  subjects  aged  &gt;  80  years)  regardless  of  their  baseline  serostatus  and seasonal influenza vaccination history. There was an increment in rates of some AEs after the second dose observed in some, but not all, studies in adults but this has not been so marked that the safety profile  would  preclude  a  second  dose  if this was  considered  desirable  (e.g. perhaps  in the immunocompromised). Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  data  have  also  shown  that  a  single  half  adult  dose  elicits  a  marked  immune  response  with  an acceptable  safety  profile  in  children  aged  from  6  months  up  to  and  including  9  years.  The  data indicated a very marked increase in HI antibody GMTs after a second dose and this was accompanied by higher rates of AEs, including fever, in children under 3 years compared with the first dose. There were also increments in frequencies of certain AEs in other age groups after the second compared to the first half adult doses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As one of the limitations of the current database the CHMP identified that the MAH has been unable to develop and validate an in-house NA assay against the pandemic H1N1V strain and therefore has been unable  to  fulfil  all  the  commitments  made  to  provide  NA  data.  However,  some  NA  data  have  been generated  by  the  MAH  from  three  outside  laboratories  using  a  range  of  methods  and  these  data strongly  support  a  conclusion  that  a  single  dose  of  the  vaccine  elicits  a  robust  NA  response.  In addition, there has been an assay of NA in a selected subset of sera by independent laboratories that demonstrate  large  increments  in  titres  after  a  single  dose.  Further  NA  data  are  expected  to  be submitted as FUMs as described above.

III.2.3.2 Clinical Safety Safety data from completed and ongoing clinical studies All the data received thus far have been fully assessed and reflected in the SmPC by means of a series of variations as considered necessary. The safety data from clinical studies has been discussed in the section on SOBs above. Additional data will be submitted and assessed along with the immunogenicity data as also listed above. Post-Marketing Experience Six simplified Periodic Safety Update Reports (sPSURs) have been submitted by the MAH. According to the MAH, the cumulative number of doses distributed as of 28 March 2010 (the data lock point of the last sPSUR) was 127,335000 in the EU and 15,543000 in the rest of the world. It is more difficult to estimate the actual number of doses administered. Based on data returns from individual EU MS at least 30 million EU subjects have been vaccinated. Age and risk group-stratified exposure data are not currently available on an EU level. As of 28 March 2010 and since the date of launch on 12 October 2009, the MAH has received 17,885 ADR reports (5098 serious) of which 171 described a fatal outcome. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The majority of  ADR  reports  relate  to  the  post-vaccination  signs  and  symptoms  that  were  reported from clinical studies and already listed in the SmPC. These have included headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea,  abdominal  pain,  dizziness,  fever,  myalgia/arthralgia,  fatigue,  malaise,  asthenia,  chills, sweating, allergic ADRs (including dyspnoea and generalised rashes), lymphadenopathy and injection site reactions (including pain, swelling and localised paraesthesia or numbness). The available data do not allow for an assessment of any change in the expected severity or frequency of such events as compared to the clinical studies.

## Serious case clusters

Since many countries prioritised subjects with chronic underlying illnesses for vaccination there have been several clusters of ADRs in specific SOCs (e.g. cardiac disorders, respiratory disorders, obesity and diabetes-related disorders, kidney disorders) that likely relate to pre-existing conditions. There is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

currently  no  suggestion  of  specific  safety  signals  arising  from  such  case  clusters.  However,  several clusters of events (e.g. pregnancy outcomes, afebrile seizures, neuropathies, demyelinating disorders) remain under close review via ongoing observed vs. expected analyses conducted by the MAH and by regulatory authorities.

## Febrile seizures

Several cases of febrile seizures in young children have been reported across the EU. In light of the evidence that emerged from the paediatric clinical trials regarding fever rates, particularly post-dose 2, section 4.8 of the Pandemrix SPC was amended to include febrile seizures as a potential risk.

Fatal events There have been 171 events with a fatal outcome reported and the MAH has provided narratives of all cases.  The  MAH  has  conducted  an  'observed  vs.  expected'  analysis  of  cases  with  a  fatal  outcome, stratified by country. So far it is concluded that overall and by country death rates in vaccinees are below the expected rates. The majority of deaths, more than half of which were in elderly patients, appeared to be most likely due to concurrent illnesses. There remains no clear evidence to suggest that the vaccine has contributed to any of these deaths. Completed safety reviews During the review of the four sPSURs the MAH was asked to provide a more detailed assessment of cases of eye disorders, herpes zoster infection, facial palsy, pregnancy-related outcomes (see below), paediatric safety review (see below), cyanosis, paralysis/paresis, hypoaesthesia, respiratory obstruction, administration errors, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, hearing disorders and arthropathies. These analyses have revealed no specific safety signals or cause for concern. Pending safety reviews Two reviews considered to be a high priority are also ongoing - Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) and afebrile seizures. Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) The MAH stated that 72 cases of suspected GBS have been reported in association with Pandemrix. Seventeen of these cases do not fit the Brighton Collaboration case definition for GBS. A further 40 cases contain insufficient clinical detail to assign a level of diagnostic certainty. On the assumption that 30 million persons have been vaccinated with Pandemrix, the MAH's analysis suggests the number of cases observed has been broadly in line with expected numbers of cases. Medicinal product no longer authorised

On 31 March 2010 the EMA convened an expert meeting to discuss the current O/E analyses of GBS and  the  ongoing  surveillance  systems  and  studies  within  Europe,  Canada  and  the  United  States  to assess GBS following vaccination. It was agreed that, based on results of O/E analyses performed in five  countries,  the  currently  available  data  are  reassuring  and  there  is  no  indication  of  a  risk  of  a similar magnitude as that found in the pandemic situation of 1976. Taking into consideration the level of  evidence  currently  available,  a  possible  association  between  the  pandemic  A/H1N1  vaccines  and GBS cannot conclusively be ruled out but, if there is an increased risk, the relative risk in vaccinated individuals  as  compared  to  non-vaccinated  ones  would  probably  lie  between  1  and  2  (i.e.  a  similar magnitude found in some studies of seasonal influenza vaccines).

It was agreed that the spontaneous data and O/E analyses will not allow this issue to be resolved. It was considered that the ongoing epidemiological studies can provide valid estimates of the risk of GBS associated with the A/H1N1 vaccines. The main issue will be the power of these studies to detect a small  increase  in  risk  (i.e.  &lt;2)  as  the  number  of  reported  cases  at  this  stage  and  the  vaccination

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

coverage are lower than expected. Given the fact that the main problem of ongoing epidemiological studies will be the lack of statistical power, an objective to be achieved is the pooling of data collected in the different studies. The VAESCO consortium will pool data from eight countries. It was also agreed that there are no additional studies or data that can be reasonably collected or currently requested from vaccine manufacturers to assist in the assessment of this issue.

The CHMP considered that, as there remains no clear evidence of an association between any of the vaccines and GBS, an update of the SmPCs would not be appropriate at this stage. It was agreed that the findings of the EU and VAESCO studies should be awaited before considering any such action. Even if an increased risk up to 2 was confirmed, it was agreed that the balance of risks and benefits would remain favourable.

Non-febrile seizures in known epileptics There have been three fatal cases of non-febrile seizures in known epileptics with onset &lt; 48 h postvaccination in the EU. In one case, the patient had a recent history of poor epilepsy control. An O/E analysis has suggested that in order to observe two coincidental deaths due to epilepsy within 48 h of vaccination in the UK approximately 300,000 epileptic patients would need to be vaccinated. At the time of the cases, it was not at all likely that this many epileptic patients had been vaccinated in the UK and therefore this was considered to be a signal requiring thorough evaluation. Nevertheless,  based  on  an  assumption  (due  to  a  lack  of  information  on  the  number  of  epileptics vaccinated) that the proportion of epileptics in the vaccinated population is the same as in the general population (4.9/1000) the MAH's O/E analysis indicates that the occurrence of three fatal cases would be near to the expected number. The  MAH's  assessment  (data  lock  21  December  2009)  identified  119  non-fatal  cases  of  non-febrile seizures following Pandemrix. In 104/119 cases the seizure occurred within 3 days of vaccination. Of 76 cases with sufficient clinical details, 34 had a history of seizure disorder. The MAH's O/E analysis of non-fatal seizures in epileptic subjects suggested that 798 cases might be expected within 2 days of vaccination. To assess the issue properly would require a formal study using available electronic data sources. The MAH has proposed to conduct a self-controlled case analysis of seizures using a Swedish database. A draft protocol for this study has been  submitted and results are expected in August/September 2010. Other Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) The available data on cases of anaphylaxis do not indicate that reporting rates are greater than the generally-expected  (with  other  vaccines)  rate  of  1  to  10  cases  per  million  doses.  Anaphylaxis  was included  in  section  4.8  of  the  SPC  during  the  marketing  period.  Available  O/E  analyses  of  cases  of Bell's  palsy  indicate  that  case  reports  are  well  within  the  expected  incidence  rate.  No  signals  are apparent for any other AESIs. Age-specific or risk group-specific events Medicinal product no longer authorised

To  address  the  gap  in  paediatric  recruitment  in  the  PASS  study  (see  below),  the  MAH  provided  a detailed assessment of all available paediatric safety data from clinical trials and post marketing. This has identified no specific safety issues in children. Other than the issue of high fever rates post dose 2 in children (see below), there remains no clear evidence of any specific safety issues in any age group or clinical risk group.

## Safety in pregnancy

Pregnant  women  are  a  target  vaccination  group  in  many  EU  countries.  The  MAH  has  provided  a detailed analysis of safety in pregnancy. As of 28 March 2010, at least 150,000 pregnant women have

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

been vaccinated with Pandemrix in the UK while up to 260,000 have been vaccinated with any licensed pandemic vaccine in the EU (the latter may be a considerable under-estimate). No safety signals have so far emerged from spontaneous reports of vaccine exposure in pregnancy. For example, the UK data indicate no excess risk of spontaneous abortion, intra-uterine death or stillbirth in vaccinated pregnant women.

In  addition  the  9000-subject PASS study enrolled 275 women known to be pregnant at the time of vaccination  of  whom  18%,  40% and  40% were in the first, second or third  trimester, respectively. Although  it  will  be  a  few  more  months  before  the  outcomes  of  all  pregnancies  are  reported  it  is currently reassuring that 111/119 have resulted in a healthy infant with 7 spontaneous abortions and one elective termination (with no apparent congenital defect) accounting for the remainder.

An  English  study  protocol  should  be  provided  for  the  German  Embryotoxicology  Pharmacovigilance Centre study.

Although pregnancy was an exclusion criterion for participation in sponsored studies there had been 11 pregnancies  reported  in  the  Q-PAN-H1N1  clinical  programme  up  to  17  January  2010.  Of  three pregnancy outcomes currently known there were two elective and one spontaneous abortion without any apparent congenital defect. These data and analyses do not raise any specific concerns at present given the known background rates of spontaneous abortion and still birth. Data from PASS study As described above (see SOB 061), the study did not identify safety issues and there was no evidence of  case  clusters  of  potential  concern  amongst  the  MedDRA  terms  report  from  the  latest  preliminary submission covering 8811 subjects. The CHMP further considered that the large amount of available post marketing data in connection with clinical  study  data  in  the  paediatric  population  would  provide  sufficient  information  to  support  the position that the safety database in this population can be considered acceptable. In the context of the RMP and as for any other vaccine the safety profile will continue to be monitored. Risk Management Plan Update The MAH provided version 4 of the RMP for Pandemrix in November 2009. The assessment of the RMP raised the points below: The risk of coring should be included as a potential risk. Post-authorisation sections of the safety specification should be updated with exposure information and a summary of any important adverse event data. Milestones  for  reporting  results  should  be  provided  for  the  Swedish  cohort  study  and  PGRx  GBS monitoring study. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Version 5 of the RMP for Pandemrix dated 5 February 2010 has addressed all these points.

The RMP that was submitted in February 2010 has been updated in order to include the change to a 6monthly PSUR cycle and provision of monthly data in forms of tables/line listings and the details of the Pharmacovigilance  SOBs  that  are  now  being  changed  into  FUMs  (SOBs  060,  061,  062).  The  MAH submitted this RMP version 6 on 30 June 2010.

## III.3 Product Information

## III.3.1. Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet

The MAH's proposals for the SmPC and PL reflect completion of all the clinical variations listed in III.1.

It should be noted that: 1. Change in indication and additional statement in section 4.4 4.1 Prophylaxis of influenza caused by A(H1N1) 2009 virus (see section 4.4). Pandemrix should be used in accordance with Official Guidance. 4.4 The vaccine can only be expected to protect against influenza caused by A/California/7/2009 The initial approval for Pandemrix limited its use to WHO Phase 6 in accordance with CHMP guidance and taking into account the paucity of data available on safety and immunogenicity at the time. Since September  2009  Pandemrix  has  been  administered  to  many  millions  of  people  across  a  wide  age range,  providing  a  substantial  safety  database.  In  addition,  data  have  been  provided  from  clinical studies in persons aged from 6 months to over 80 years and the SmPC has been amended on several occasions to reflect these data. While no further pandemic waves are predicted within the EU the usual feature of pandemics is that the influenza A strain and its drift variants persist as the most common cause of seasonal influenza up to  the  time  of  the  next  pandemic.  For  this  reason  it  has  already  been  recommended  that  suitable strains should be used in the manufacture of the trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines for the winter 2010-2011. Uptake of pandemic influenza vaccine has been variable across EU countries thus far. A substantial proportion of the population, including those in groups at risk of complications from influenza, may still be unprotected by means of naturally-acquired or vaccine-induced immunity. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Since  all  relevant  non  clinical  and  clinical  data  within  the  context  of  Article  21  of  Commission Regulation  (EC)  1234/2007,  have  been  submitted  as  part  of  either  FUMs/SOBs  or  variations,  such provision is therefore considered adequately fulfilled and the exceptional and temporary nature of the variations to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation for Pandemrix as initially granted in September 2009, not anymore required. Consequently the indication can now be read as stated above.

Thus  the  proposed  change  in  indication  allows  further  use  of  vaccine  within  the  EU  regardless  of whether or not the current WHO pandemic phase is maintained or altered. The addition to section 4.4

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

is  intended  to  underline  the  difference  between  Pandemrix  and  the  forthcoming  trivalent  seasonal vaccines.

## 2. Updates to other sections

Several  other  sections  of  the  Pandemrix  SmPC  were  updated  during  this  procedure  so  that  the emphasis is now placed on the substantial data obtained with the vaccine itself, allowing the H5N1 data  to  be  removed  and  replaced.  In  addition,  the  changes  involve  removal  of  the  cautionary statements regarding the limits of data from clinical studies in various age groups and replacement with references to section  5.1  where  the  limited  numbers  formally  assessed  for  safety  and immunogenicity during clinical studies are clearly displayed.

## IV OVERALL CONCLUSION AND BENEFIT/RISK ASSESSMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NEW INDICATION AND CHANGE TO FULL MA

The overall benefit/risk of Pandemrix in the prophylaxis of influenza caused by A(H1N1) 2009 virus (see section 4.4) is considered favourable. The CHMP considers that there is no major concern. Benefit profile In contrast to the immunogenicity data obtained with the mock-up vaccine Pandemrix H5N1/AS03 all the experience with Pandemrix (H1N1)v has demonstrated the likelihood that a single dose (full adult or half adult according to age group) may be sufficient. The longer-term follow-up of subjects in study 008  will  eventually  provide  data  from  adults  that  may  demonstrate  whether  there  is  any  possible benefit in the longer term of two vs. one priming doses. Currently  there  are  very  limited  neutralising  antibody  data  available  although  titres  generated  in contracted laboratories from subsets of sera have generally demonstrated robust immune responses to a first dose. In addition, taking into account the considerations regarding the validity of applying the CHMP criteria used to assess HI responses to seasonal influenza vaccines to responses to a pandemic strain, the CHMP considered that the SmPC should not preclude the administration of a second dose of Pandemrix  (H1N1)v  in  any  age  group  for  which  a  dose  regimen  is  provided  in  the  current  SmPC. Nevertheless, due to the reactogenicity of a second dose in children, the SmPC carries details of fever rates  and  rates  of  other  reactions  to  the  second  compared  to  the  first  doses  in  children  by  age subgroups. Risk profile Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  view  of  safety,  following  six  months  of  marketing  experience  with  Pandemrix  (H1N1)v  the substantial  data  indicate  that  the  safety  profile  is  acceptable.  This  body  of  evidence  is  thought  to reflect vaccination of at least 30 million individuals across the EU. The majority of ADRs reported relate to the signs and symptoms of the listed and expected side effects of Pandemrix. Since approval of the strain  change  variation  febrile  convulsion  was  included  as  a  possible  side  effect  in  the  SmPC  and anaphylaxis was moved to the section of ADRs actually reported with the vaccine. The available data do not indicate any excess risk of anaphylaxis. There is currently no evidence of any risk of vaccination during pregnancy.

Afebrile  seizures  in  known  epileptics  and  Guillain  Barre  Syndrome  (GBS)  remain  under  very  close review.  There  is  currently  no  suggestion  of  an  excess  risk  of  GBS  of  the  magnitude  observed  with swine  influenza  vaccines  in  the  1970s.  An  ad  hoc  expert  group  was  convened  in  March  2010  to consider  ways  to  more  formally  evaluate  the  GBS  signal.  At  present,  these  are  unconfirmed  safety signals.  The  available  data  from  the  PASS  study  indicate  that  some  local  and  general  solicited

symptoms may have occurred at a higher frequency than was observed in clinical studies. However, rates of Grade 3 symptoms and those requiring medical attention have been very low.

## Re-assessment of B/R profile in the context of the revised indication and switch to a full MA

The Specific Obligations concerning the evaluation of safety and effectiveness as introduced during the initial  authorisation  and  the  variation  in  order  to  introduce  the  pandemic  (H1N1)v  strain  have  been sufficiently  addressed  to  conclude  on  the  maintenance  of  a  positive  risk/benefit  for  the  use  of Pandemrix in the current Community epidemiological situation.

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  MAH  has  now  provided  sufficient  comprehensive  safety  and  efficacy data such that grounds to maintain the MA under exceptional circumstances are no longer applicable. In  addition  specific  procedures  concerning safety are no longer required in context Article 14 (8) of Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  as  these  can  be  achieved  in  context  of  the  conventional  Risk Management Plan. Furthermore the safety data presented in additional studies submitted since the initial approval and in the  sPSURs  have  been  satisfactory.  Overall  a  favourable  benefit-risk  assessment  continues  to  be applicable to use in the population for which Pandemrix is indicated. Conclusion Based on the review of the data submitted by the MAH as evidence of compliance with the specific obligations  and  having  re-assessed  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  the  medicinal  product  further  to  the provision of comprehensive data on efficacy and safety such that the grounds set out in Part II.6 of Annex I  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  are  no  longer  applying  to  maintain  the  MA  under  Article  14(8)  of Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004,  the  CHMP  recommends  to  change  the  status  of  the  marketing authorisation outside the scope of Art. 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No /2004 for Pandemrix (Influenza vaccine (H1N1)v (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted). The  CHMP  in  making  this recommendation  has  taken  into  consideration  that  comprehensive information  on  clinical  safety  and  efficacy  have  now  been  provided  and  that  specific  procedures  in particular concerning safety are no longer required such that the grounds to maintain the licence under exceptional circumstances are no longer considered to apply. In  addition  the  CHMP,  having  reviewed  all  relevant  clinical  data  within  the  context  of  Article  21  of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, considers that adequate information has been supplied to recommend a change of the indication outside of the restricted clinical setting of a pandemic and that the temporary and exceptional nature concerning the approval of the variation introducing the strain change no longer applies. Medicinal product no longer authorised

As a result of the above the recommended indication now reads as follows: Prophylaxis of influenza caused by A(H1N1) 2009 virus (see section 4.4 of SmPC). Pandemrix should be used in accordance with Official Guidance thus allowing for further use of vaccine within the EU regardless of whether or not the current WHO pandemic phase is maintained or altered during the coming year.
