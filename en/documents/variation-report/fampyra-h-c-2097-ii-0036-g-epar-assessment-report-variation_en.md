## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Requested group of variations

Pursuant to Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Biogen Idec Ltd submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 25 November 2016 an application for a group of variations.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variations requested   | Variations requested                                                                                              | Type    | Annexes affected     |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------|
| C.I.4                  | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I, II, IIIA and IIIB |
| C.I.4                  | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I                    |
| C.I.4                  | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I, II, IIIA and IIIB |

This is a grouped variation proposing updates to the SmPC sections 4.2, 5.1, Annex II and Package Leaflet based on the clinical study ENHANCE; to the SmPC section 4.6 based on the data from the FOLLOW pregnancy registry. Further changes to the PI, section 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been introduced based on the Core Data Sheet (CDS) and PRAC review of the Fampyra PSUR 03. The RMP (version 11) has been updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10.0. Finally, with this application the MAH requests to switch the conditional marketing authorisation to a marketing authorisation not subject to specific obligations.

The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## 1.2. Rationale for the proposed changes

Fampyra is a prolonged release (PR) tablet formulation containing fampridine or 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). Fampridine  is  indicated  for  the  improvement  of  walking  in  adult  patients  with  multiple  sclerosis  with walking disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale 4-7).

Fampyra received a conditional marketing authorisation in 2011 subject to the provision of results of a long-term efficacy and safety study to investigate a broader primary endpoint that is clinically meaningful in terms of walking ability and to further evaluate the early identification of responders.

In this group of variations the MAH submitted final data from the outstanding specific obligation study ENHANCE (218MS305), a multicenter, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled parallel group study to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of prolonged release Fampridine 10 mg, administered twice daily in subjects with multiple sclerosis.

Changes  to  the  Product  Information  and  the  RMP  are  proposed  consequently.  As  submission  of  the ENHANCE data fulfils the specific obligation, the MAH requested to convert the marketing authorisation from conditional to one no longer subject to specific obligations.

Additionally, the MAH submitted results of the pregnancy registry FOLLOW (218MS402) and proposed PI

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

updates accordingly. Minor PI updates based on the recent PSUR assessment have also been proposed.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

As part of CMA the Applicant conducted the ENHANCE study which now has been completed. The aim of the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  clinical  meaningfulness  of  the  effect  of  fampridine  in  terms  of  walking ability as well as the long-term efficacy and safety.

The ENHANCE study is a randomised placebo-controlled parallel group study in 636 subjects with multiple sclerosis and walking disability. Subjects were randomised to placebo or fampridine PR 10 mg BID. The duration  of  the  double-blind  part  was  24  weeks  with  a  2  week  post-treatment  follow-up.  Primary endpoint was the proportion of responders defined as subjects with a mean improvement on the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale of ≥ 8 points as compared to baseline. An improvement of 8 points on the MSWS12 has been accepted as a clinical meaningful change in earlier assessment of the study protocol of the ENHANCE study.

The ENHANCE study met its primary endpoint. The responder rate was 33.6% for placebo and 43.2% for fampridine PR 10 mg BID (Risk difference 10.4%, CI95% 3%; 17.8%, p=0.006). The  LS mean change in MSWS  score  was  -6.73  point  and-2.59  points  in  subjects  treated  with  fampridine  PR  and  placebo respectively (Difference -4.14, CI95% -6.22, -2.06; p &lt; 0.001). The effect of fampridine treatment was evident as early as week 2 and was sustained throughout the 24-week treatment period. Discontinuation of  treatment  resulted  in  worsening  of  the  MSWS-12  score  in  the  fampridine-PR  group  but  not  in  the placebo group.

Efficacy on the MSWS-12 was consistent with the findings with respect to the Time Up and GO responders score and the MSIS29-physical score. There were no statistical significant differences with respect to the Berg Balance Scale (BBS; a measure of static balance) and ABILHAND (measure of subject's perceived difficulty in performing everyday manual activities). The proportion of subjects reporting an improvement on  the  Patient  Global  Impression  of  Change  (PGIC)  at  Week  2  was  31%  vs  38%  for  placebo  and fampridine PR respectively. This was 22% and 28% at week 24. Findings for the EQ-5D-3L, SDMT, SF-36, and HRU showed relatively little change from baseline and minimal differences between the groups.

The  results  of  the  ENHANCE  study  confirm  that  treatment  with  fampridine  results  in  a  clinically meaningful  improvement  in  walking  in  a  proportion  of  patients  with  multiple  sclerosis  with  walking disability  despite  the  fact  that  the  effect  size  may  be  considered  as  modest.  The  safety  profile  of fampridine observed in the ENHANCE is not different from what is already known for fampridine, and no new signals were raised.

Summarising the aim of the ENHANCE study, i.e. to establish the clinical meaningfulness of fampridine in improving walking so as to establish the long term efficacy and safety, this is considered met. Overall the benefit/risk of fampridine remains positive and the granting of a MA not subject to specific obligations is considered justified.

Furthermore, the CHMP agreed to the Product Information changes reflecting data from the pregnancy registry. Conversely, the CHMP refused changes to the statement that fampridine should be taken without food as the Committee considered that more data substantiating this change were needed.

## Scientific Summary for the EPAR

In this group of variations the MAH submitted data from the Enhance study (218MS305) conducted in 636 subjects with multiple sclerosis and walking disability. Duration of double-blind treatment was 24 weeks with a 2 week post-treatment follow-up. The primary endpoint was improvement in walking ability,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

measured as the proportion of patients achieving a mean improvement of ≥ 8 points from baseline MSWS-12 score over 24 weeks.  In this study there was a statistically significant treatment difference, with a greater proportion of Fampyra treated patients demonstrating an improvement in walking ability, compared to placebo-controlled patients (relative risk of 1.38 (95% CI:  [1.06, 1.70]).  Improvements generally appeared within 2 to 4 weeks of initiation of treatment, and disappeared within 2 weeks of treatment cessation. Based on the results of the study it was agreed that specific obligation has been fulfilled, and therefore it is deleted from the Annex II.

Furthermore, the MAH submitted results of the pregnancy registry FOLLOW which was terminated early due to lack of subject exposure to prolonged-release fampridine during pregnancy. The limited data available indicated no adverse effect of fampridine on the pregnancy outcomes.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, this application regarding the following changes:

| Variations accepted   | Variations accepted                                                                                               | Type    | Annexes affected     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------|
| C.I.4                 | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I, II, IIIA and IIIB |
| C.I.4                 | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I                    |

This is a grouped variation proposing updates to the SmPC sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, Annex II and Package Leaflet based on the clinical study ENHANCE and to the SmPC section 4.6 based on the data from the FOLLOW pregnancy registry. The RMP (version 11) has been updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10.0. Finally, the CHMP recommends the granting of a marketing authorisation no longer subject to specific obligations.

## is recommended for approval.

The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

In addition, the following changes in the group are not acceptable:

| Variations refused   | Variations refused                                                                                                | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | none               |

Updates to sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC based on the Core Data Sheet (CDS) and PRAC review of the Fampyra PSUR 03.

## Grounds for refusal:

## Whereas:

- insufficient data were submitted to support the proposed Product Information changes following the conclusion of the PSUR 3 assessment that the MAH should comment and reconsider the need of a Product

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Information update in line with the current CCDS regarding information of 'no clinically meaningful consequences when fampridine is administered with food', the CHMP has recommended the refusal of the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation.

The following obligation has been fulfilled, and therefore it is recommended that it be deleted from the Annex II to the Opinion:

| Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Due date         |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| To provide results of a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, long-term efficacy and safety study to investigate a broader primary endpoint clinically meaningful in terms of walking ability and to further evaluate the early identification of responders in order to guide further treatment based on a CHMP agreed protocol. An update of the progress in completing the obligation should be provided every 6 months. | 31 December 2016 |

## Additional monitoring

Pursuant to Article 23(3) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Fampyra (fampridine) is removed from the additional monitoring list as the specific obligation has been fulfilled and the medicinal product was authorised more than 5 years ago.

Therefore the statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety information, preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle, is removed from the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet.

## 4. Scientific discussion

## 4.1. Introduction

Fampyra is a prolonged release (PR) tablet formulation containing fampridine or 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). Fampyra is also known as Ampyra (dalfampridine).

Fampridine  is  indicated  for  the  improvement  of  walking  in  adult  patients  with  multiple  sclerosis  with walking disability.

Fampridine  is  a  potassium  channel  blocker  effective  at  selective  types  of  voltage-gated  potassium channels. Fampridine facilitates signal transmission in demyelinated axons, improving impaired neurological function induced by demyelination.

Fampridine has been granted a conditional approval as the product demonstrated benefits in terms of improving walking speed together with an improvement on the multiple-sclerosis walking scale score. The conditional  marketing  authorization  application  for fampridine  was  supported  by  1  Phase 2  study  (MSF202), 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies (MS-F203 and MS-F204), and 3 extension studies (MS-F202EXT, MSF203EXT, and MS-F204EXT).

However, approximately only one third of the patients may benefit from treatment, and the extent of benefit provided by fampridine was not completely explained by the data generated.  In particular the clinical  meaningfulness of walking endpoints, long term safety, and efficacy needed further evaluation. Therefore, at the time of approval the CHMP was of the opinion that additional efficacy data was required, i.e. from a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, long-term efficacy and safety study in order to investigate a  broader  primary  endpoint,  which  is  clinically  meaningful  in  terms  of  walking  ability  and  to  further

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

evaluate the early identification of responders in order to guide further treatment. Hence, the marketing authorisation was granted subject to a following condition:

'To  conduct  a  double-blinded,  placebo-controlled,  long-term  efficacy  and  safety  study  to  investigate  a broader primary endpoint clinically meaningful in terms of walking ability and to further evaluate the early identification of responders in order to guide further treatment based on a CHMP protocol. An update of the process in completing the obligation should be provided every 6 months. (SOB10.1).'

To fulfil this obligation the Applicant has submitted a clinical development plan containing a two step plan with a phase 2 exploratory study (MOBILE) and a phase 3 confirmatory study (ENHANCE).

Study 218MS205 (MOBILE) in 132 subjects was performed to explore the impact of prolonged  release fampridine on overall walking disability and to further elucidate the clinical relevance of changes over the 24 week treatment duration. Using the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and other anchor and distribution-based analyses, the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) on the 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12) was estimated at 8 points and the MCID for improvement of Timed Up and Go (TUG) speed was estimated to be a ≥15% mean increase in speed over a 24-week treatment period.

The ENHANCE study (study 218MS305) now has been completed and is submitted.  Based on the results from the ENHANCE study the Applicant concludes that the specific obligations of the conditional marketing authorization have been fulfilled and requests for a full marketing authorization.

## 4.2. Clinical Efficacy aspects

## Enhance study  (study 218MS305)

## 4.2.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

The Enhance study concerned a randomised, multicentre (n=92) double blind, placebo controlled parallel group study  to evaluate the long tem efficacy and safety of fampridine PR 10 mg  BID in 646 subjects with multiple sclerosis.

The study was performed in in Bulgaria (13 sites), Czech Republic (9 sites), Finland (4 sites), Great Britain (13 sites), Italy (5 sites), Lithuania (3 sites), Netherlands (3 sites), Poland (16 sites), Russia (6 sites), Serbia (3 sites), and US (17 sites).

The primary objective was  to determine whether prolonged-release fampridine 10 mg twice daily has a clinically meaningful effect on patient-reported walking ability over a 24-week treatment period. Main  inclusion  criteria  were  a  documented  diagnosis  of  MS  (RRMS,  PRMS  SPMS,  PPMS  )  of  at  least  3 months duration,  an EDSS score of 4 and ≤7  and the presence of a walking impairment as deemed by the investigator. Main exclusion criteria were the presence of history of seizures, MS exacerbation &lt; 60 days  prior  screening,  concurrent  medications  and/or  conditions  that  interferes  with  walking  capacity, initiation of disease modifying treatments,  renal dysfunction and hepatitis.

After  a  2  week  screening  period,  subjects  were  randomised  to  fampridine  PR  10  mg  BID  or  matching placebo. Randomisation ratio was 1:1 and randomisation was stratified by baseline EDSS score (≤6 or &gt;6)  and  after  an  protocol  amendment  by  prior  amino-pyridine  use.  Duration  of  double-blind  was  24 weeks. This was followed by a 14 day post-dosing follow-up.

The following efficacy assessments were performed:

MSWS-12: The Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale is a 12-item questionnaire that asks subjects to rate

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

limitations of their mobility due to MS during the preceding 2 weeks on a 5-point Likert scale from not at all  (1)  to  extremely  (5).  Subjects  were  asked  if  they  cannot  walk  at  all  at  the  beginning  of  the questionnaire,  and  if  the  subject  indicated  this  was  the  case,  then  they  did  not  respond  to  the  12 questions. The transformed scale ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores showing a greater degree of limitation in walking due to MS.

TUG : The  Timed  up  en  Go  test  is  a  mobility  assessment  in  which  subjects  must  stand  from  a  seated position  in  a  chair,  walk  3  meters,  and  turn  and  return  to  seated.  The  time  to  complete  the  task  is recorded.

MSIS-29 physical score : The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale is a subject completed questionnaire that comprises 29 questions to measure the physical (questions 1 to 20) and psychological (questions 21 to 29)  impact  of  MS.  The  physical  score  is  calculated  by  summing  across  the  20  relevant    items  and transformed to a scale from 1 (no impact of MS) to 100 (extreme impact of MS).

BBS: The  Berg  Balance  Scale  is  a  clinical  test  of  a  subject's  static  and  dynamic  balance  ability,  and includes  14  balance-related  tasks,  each  scored  from  unable  to  perform  (0)  to  able  to  perform independently (4). The total score ranges from 0 (poor balance) to 56 (good balance).

ABILHAND :  The  ABILHAND  is  a  subject-completed  questionnaire  that  measures  a  subject's  perceived difficulty in performing everyday manual activities during the preceding 3 months. Subjects rate a list of 56 activities as impossible (0), difficult (1), or easy (2). The transformed scale ranges from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate greater manual ability.

PGIC : The  Patient  Global  Impression  of  Change  elicits  a  subject's  rating  of  change  in  overall  walking compared with the prior study visit using a 7-point Likert scale including very much worse (1), unchanged (4), and very much improved (7).

EQ-5D-3L : The  EuroQol  health-related  quality  of  life  questionnaire  is  an  assessment  of  5  aspects  of health-related quality of life (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each on a 3-point scale ranging from no problems (1) to extreme problems (3). The assessment also includes a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from worst imagined health state (0) to best imagined health state (100); positive change indicates improvement.

SDMT : The Symbol Digit Modalities Test is a substitution test that assesses changes in cognitive function over time. Subjects have 90 seconds to pair numbers with geometric figures, and the score is the number of correct responses during that time. Positive change indicates improvement.

SF-36 : The  Short  Form  Health  Survey    is  a  health  survey  with  36  questions  split  across  several categories (Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional,  Mental  Health,  and  Reported  Health  Transition)  that  are  used  to  construct  a  physical component summary (PCS) and a mental component summary (MCS).

HRU : The  Health  Resources  Utilization    questionnaire  collects  information  on  how  MS  affects  subjects' lives  and  how they  use  health  care  services.  The  questions  are  grouped  into  sections  for  Work  Status (whether  a  subject  is  employed  and  whether  lack  of  employment  is  due  to  walking  problems)  and Absenteeism (days missed due to walking problems), Health Care Services (types of health care providers visited due to MS), and Caregiver Services (use and frequency of visits to the subject by caregivers).

The  primary  endpoint was  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  achieved  a  mean  improvement  on  the MSWS-12 of ≥8 points from baseline over the 24-week treatment period. If a subject's mean MSWS-12 was  &lt;8  points  at  baseline,  the  subject  was  counted  as  having  a  ≥8-point  mean  improvement  from baseline if their mean MSWS-12 score during the treatment period was &lt;0.5.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Secondary efficacy endpoints were the  Timed Up and Go (TUG), 29-Item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), the  Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the ABILHAND.

Exploratory  endpoints concerned  the  Patient  Global  Impression  of  Change  (PGIC),  the  EuroQol-5 Dimensions-3 Levels (EQ-5D-3L) visual analog scale (VAS) and utility score, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test  (SDMT)  and  the  36-Item  Short  Form  Health  Survey  (SF-36),  with  physical  component  subscale (PCS) and mental component subscale (MCS) and  Health resource utilization (HRU).

Safety  variables concerned  the  occurrence  of  adverse  events,  physical  examination,  vital  signs, electrocardiogram,  and    clinical  laboratory  assessments  (including  urine  culture  for  suspected  urinary tract infection).

Sample  Size  Calculations: a  sample  size  of  approximately  590  subjects  (295  subjects  in  each treatment  group)  was  expected  to  provide  at  least  90%  power  at  a  2-sided  5%  significance  level  to detect  a  minimum  of  14.5%  absolute  improvement  in  the  on-treatment  response  rate  (i.e.  ≥  8-point mean improvement on MSWS-12 over 24 weeks) for the prolonged-release fampridine group relative to the placebo group, assuming a response rates of 50% under the null hypothesis and a 15% dropout rate.

Analysis population: The main population for efficacy analyses was the ITT population defined as all subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study treatment and had at least 1 postbaseline  efficacy  assessment,  excluding  subjects  from  one  site  due  to  GCP  noncompliance. The  safety population  consisted  of  all  subjects  who  were  randomized  and  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study treatment, excluding subjects from one site.

## Methods of analyses

## Primary efficacy analysis

The primary efficacy analysis was performed in the ITT population with missing data handled using the multiple  imputation  method.  Comparisons  between  the  prolonged-release  fampridine  and  placebo treatment groups were made using a logistic regression model adjusted for treatment group, baseline MSWS-12 score, baseline TUG speed, age, prior AP use, and screening EDSS score.

Sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint concerned analysis of the PP population, analysis of observed data, analysis including the one site analysis exclusion subjects with prior use of amino-pyridine, among others.

## Secondary efficacy analysis

TUG : The proportion of subjects who achieved a mean improvement in TUG speed of ≥15% from baseline over  a    24-week  period  was  compared  between  treatment  groups  using  a  logistic  regression  model adjusted for treatment group,  baseline TUG speed, prior aminopyridine use, and screening EDSS score. Baseline was defined as the mean speed over the Screening and Day 1 Visits.

MSIS-29 physical score, BBS, and ABILHAND: The mean changes from baseline over 24 weeks in the MSIS-29 physical score, BBS, and ABILHAND scores were compared using a mixed effects model adjusted for  treatment  group,  corresponding  baseline  score,  screening  EDSS  score,  prior  AP  use,  and  visit-bytreatment interaction.

## Multiplicity

Hypothesis testing was performed at the 2-sided 5% significance level overall, with adjustment for testing multiple  secondary  endpoints  using  a  combination  of  the  sequential  stepdown  procedure  and  the Hochberg procedure to control the overall Type I error rate. 1. The 4 secondary endpoints were divided into the following 2 groups i.e. Group 1: TUG responders, change from baseline in the MSIS-29, physical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

score,  Group  2:  change  in  BBS,  change  in  ABILHAND.  If  the  each  endpoint  in  group  1  was  were statistically significant at the 5% significance level, then each of the endpoints in Group 2 were tested at the 5% significance level.  If one of the endpoints in Group 1 had a p-value greater than 0.05, then the other endpoint in Group 1 was tested at the 2.5% significance level, and then the Group 2 endpoints were each  tested  at  the  2.5%  significance  level.  If  neither  of  the  endpoints  in  Group  1  were  statistically significant  based  on  either  of  the  2  criteria  above,  the  endpoints  in  Group  2  were  not  considered statistically significant.

## Secondary en exploratory efficacy analysis

Least squares (LS) means, LS mean differences, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were presented for the  EQ-5D-3L  VAS  and  utility  score  and  SDMT  using  a  mixed  model  for  repeated  measures  with randomized  treatment  group,  visit,  baseline  score,  EDSS  score  at  screening,  treatment  group-by-visit interaction, and prior AP use included in the model. Analyses of SF-36 were performed using an analysis of covariance with adjustment for treatment group, baseline score (PCS or MCS), screening EDSS score, and prior AP use, and LS means, LS mean differences, and 95% CIs were presented. The proportions of subjects with an improvement on the PGIC and changes in HRU over time were also summarized.

## Evaluation of Early Assessment of Response

Analyses were also performed to assess the predictive values of different measures of early response.

Study data were also used for evaluating the early identification of responders.  The following analyses were performed using MSWS-12 and TUG speed data to assess whether subjects who showed benefit after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment were the same subjects who were responders on the MSWS-12 over 24 weeks:  Positive  predictive  value  (PPV),  Negative  predictive  value  (NPV):  Sensitivity  and  Specificity. Different definitions of early response at each of 2 and 4 weeks were used to predict the overall response on MSWS-12.

## Subgroup analysis

Analyses  of  MSWS-12  response,  TUG  speed,  MSIS-29  physical  component  scores,  BBS  scores,  and ABILHAND were performed for the following subgroups: EDSS score (≤6,  &gt;6), MS disease phenotype (RRMS, SPMS, PPMS, PRMS), MSWS-12 baseline score (≤ median, &gt; median). Analyses of MSWS-12 and TUG speed were also performed for Age group (≤45 years, &gt;45 years), Sex (male, female), BMI (&lt;18.5 kg/m 2 , 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m 2 , 25 to 29.9 kg/m 2 , ≥30 kg/m 2 ) and concomitant immunomodulator use (yes, no).

## 4.2.2. Results

## Patient disposition, baseline feature

In  table  4.2.2.1a  and  table  4.2.2.1b  the  number  of  subjects,  demographics  and  baseline  features  are presented.    A  total  of  636  subjects  were  randomised  at  92  sites  worldwide.  Data  from  one  site  were excluded due to serious Good Clinical Practice (GCP) noncompliance. The decision to close this site was based primarily on the lack of appropriate source documents to support the accuracy completeness, and reliability  of  the  data  entered  in  the  case  report  form.  Ten  subjects  were  randomized  at  the  site. Sensitivity  analyses  that  include  data  from  this  site  showed  no  appreciable  difference  in  the  overall outcomes of efficacy evaluations relative to analyses that exclude these data.

Treatment was discontinued in 15% of the subjects treated with fampridine-and in 19% of in the placebo group.  The  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  in  both  groups  was  adverse  events  (7%  in  both treatment groups). Subject's  perception of lack of efficacy was reason to discontinue in 2 subjects (&lt;1%) treated with fampridine-PR and in 10 subjects (3%) treated with placebo.

Demographics, baseline disease characteristics, are presented in table 4.2.2.1b.  Demographics features, baseline disease characteristics, and medical history of  were comparable for both study arms.

The proportions of subjects with each MS type, duration of disease were similar in the fampridine-PR and placebo groups.

The treatment groups were balanced with respect to EDSS score, MSWS-12 score, TUG speed, MSIS-29 physical score, BBS score and ABILHAND score.  Concomitant medication use was similar in treatment groups  and  prior  aminopyridine  use  was  also  balanced.  Most  frequent  immunomodulators  used  were glatiramer,  (8%/9% for placebo and fampridine respectively), fingolimod (7%/7%), interferon beta-1a (7%/6%) and natalizumab (6%/7%). Anti-epileptic agents affecting sodium-potassium was  were used in:  43  subjects  (14%)  treated  with  prolonged-release  fampridine  and  44  subjects  (14%)  treated  with placebo. The most common agents used were gabapentin, clonazepam, and pregabalin.

## Efficacy

## Primary endpoints, primary efficacy analysis

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved a mean improvement on the MSWS-12 of ≥8 points from baseline over a 24-week treatment period. A higher proportion of subjects treated with prolonged-release fampridine demonstrated a ≥8-point mean improvement on the MSWS-12 over 24 weeks compared with subjects treated with placebo. The primary efficacy analysis using a logistic regression model showed that the treatment difference was statistically significant; the odds ratio was 1.61  (95%CI:  [1.15,  2.26];  p  =  0.006  in  favour  of  prolonged-release  fampridine.  These  findings  are supported by the relative risk of 1.38 (95% CI: [1.06, 1.70]) and the risk difference of 0.104 (95% CI: [0.030, 0.178]. See table 2a.

A A  responder  is  defined  as  a  subject  with  a  mean  improvement  of  at  least  8  points  over  24  weeks  compared  to baseline. If a subjects has a mean MSWS-12 score of &lt;0.5 over the double-blind period, and a baseline MSWS-12 score of &lt;8 points, the subject is counted as a responder.

B Based on logistic regression, adjusting for baseline MSWS-12 score, baseline TUG speed, age, screening EDSS score and prior aminopyridine use.

The LS mean change in MSWS score was -6.73 point and-2.59 points in subjects treated with fampridine PR and placebo respectively.  The LS mean difference between the groups was -4.14 (95% CI: -6.22, 2.06; p &lt; 0.001). The effect of prolonged-release fampridine treatment was evident  as early as Week 2, and was sustained throughout the 24-week treatment period (figure 1). Upon discontinuation of doubleblind  treatment  after  24  weeks,  scores  worsened  among  subjects  treated  with  prolonged-release fampridine but not among those treated with placebo.

## Subgroup analysis primary endpoint

Subgroup analysis largely supported the main findings. See figure 2. The proportions of responders were higher among subjects with RRMS, and lower among subjects with SPMS and PPMS, relative to the overall population. The results among subjects with PRMS were inconsistent with those of the main analysis. For subjects with less disability (i.e., a lower baseline MSWS-12 score), the difference in proportions and odds ratio are larger than those for the overall population. For subjects with greater disability, the difference in proportions and odds ratio are smaller than for the overall population.

Among subjects with a baseline EDSS score &gt;6, the proportion of MSWS-12 responders was lower and the difference between the groups was smaller for both measures.

Among  subjects  with  RRMS,  results  were  generally  more  favourable  in  both  groups  than  for  the population overall, and among subjects with SPMS, results were generally slightly less favorable in both groups than for the population overall, which may be expected given the natural course of the disease, but treatment differences in favour of fampridine-PR remained.

Among subjects with PPMS and PRMS, differences between the groups were generally smaller than for the population overall or, in some instances favored placebo treatment, particularly for PRMS. These findings were likely affected by the small sample sizes in these subgroups and also by the greater disability and likelihood of progression among subjects with these disease types.

The  difference  between  the  groups  in  proportions  of  responders  on  the  MSWS-12  was  greater  among those  with  baseline  MSWS-12  lower  than  the  median  (67.71)  and  smaller  among  those  with  higher baseline scores.

Within the subgroups of only males and only females, the proportions of responders were similar to that of the overall population for subjects treated with prolonged-release fampridine. For subjects treated with placebo, the proportions of responders were lower among males and higher among females relative to the overall population. Male: 0.431 for prolonged-release fampridine and 0.301 for placebo; odds ratio 1.91  (95%  CI:  [1.11,  3.28]).  Female:  0.434  for  prolonged-release  fampridine  and  0.362  for  placebo; odds ratio 1.52 (95% CI: [0.96, 2.39]).

Because  the  number  of  subjects  over  64  years  of  age  was  small,  these  subjects  were  combined  with those  &gt;45  years  of  age.  The  proportions  of  responders  in  both  treatment  groups  were  slightly  larger among younger subjects and slightly smaller among older subjects than those of the overall population. ≤45  years:  0.452  for  prolonged-release  fampridine  and  0.373  for  placebo;  odds  ratio  1.48  (95%  CI: [0.84, 2.61]).  &gt;45 years: 0.422 for prolonged-release fampridine and 0.315 for placebo; odds ratio 1.73 (95% CI: [1.13, 2.65]).

Relative to the overall  population,  proportions  of  responders  were  higher  among  subjects  with concomitant use of immunomodulators and lower among subjects without, but the treatment differences were  similar  to  that  of  the  overall  population  in  favour  of  prolonged-release  fampridine.  Using immunomodulators: 0.483 for prolonged-release fampridine and 0.386 for placebo; odds ratio 1.58 (95% CI: [0.91, 2.73]). Not using immunomodulators: 0.399 for prolonged-release fampridine and 0.304 for placebo; odds ratio 1.60 (95% CI: [1.02, 2.50]).

## Exploratory analysis primary endpoint

Exploratory analysis showed that the benefit from treatment with fampridine-PR was robust at each threshold of improvement from 0 to 10 points (figure 3).

## Sensitivity analysis primary endpoint

ITT population using a placebo imputation method: The proportion of  responders in the fampridine-PR group (0.419) was smaller than the proportion in the  main analysis (0.432), but it was still greater than the proportion of responders in the placebo group (0.336), and the treatment difference was statistically significant (p =0.013; odds ratio: 1.53; 95% CI: [1.09, 2.15]).

ITT  population  with  adjustment  for  any  major  protocol  deviation  related  to  IP  compliance:  The proportions  of  responders  in  each  group  were  the  same  as  those  observed  in  the  main  analysis.  The treatment difference was statistically significant (p = 0.007; odds ratio: 1.60 in favor of fampridine-PR; 95%  CI:  [1.14,  2.25]),  and  the  interaction  was  not  statistically  significant  (p=0.720  for  the  IP compliance-by-treatment interaction).

## Secondary endpoints

## Results with respect to the secondary endpoints are summarised in table 4.2.2.2.b.

A  greater  proportion  of  subjects  treated  with  fampridine-PR  demonstrated  a  mean  improvement  of  at least 15% in TUG speed over 24 weeks compared with subjects treated with placebo. The results from the logistic regression analysis showed a statistically significant treatment difference with an odds ratio of 1.46 (95% CI: [1.04, 2.07]; p = 0.030). The relative risk was 1.25 (95% CI: [0.99, 1.51]) and the risk difference was 0.092 (95% CI: [0.009, 0.175]).

A greater LS mean improvement in MSIS-29 physical score was observed among subjects treated with fampridine-PR over 24 weeks than among subjects treated with placebo. The LS mean difference between the groups showed a statistically significant treatment difference.

A  greater  LS  mean  improvement  in  BBS  was  observed  in  subjects  treated  with  fampridine-PR  than  in subjects treated with placebo. The treatment difference was not statistically significant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A greater LS mean improvement in ABILHAND score was observed for subjects treated with fampridinePR than for subjects treated with placebo. The treatment difference was not statistically significant.

The  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  any  improvement  on  the  PGIC,  which,  like  the  MSWS-12,  is  a patient-reported  assessment  of  walking  ability,  was  greater  in  the  fampridine-PR  group  than  in  the placebo  group  at  each  time  point.  At  Week  2,  which  showed  change  since  the  onset  of  treatment (because  the  PGIC  assessed  changes  since  the  previous  visit),  improvement  was  reported  by  116 subjects (38%) treated with fampridine-PR and 95 subjects (31%) treated with placebo.

Findings  for  the  EQ-5D-3L,  SDMT,  SF-36,  and  HRU  showed  relatively  little  change  from  baseline  and minimal differences between the groups.

## Identification of Responders

Among subjects treated with fampridine-PR, any improvement on the MSWS-12 at Week 2 or 4 showed strong PPV and NPV for the response (≥8-point mean improvement) over the 24-week treatment period.

Among subjects  who had any improvement on the MSWS-12 at Week 2 (197 subjects), the probability that a subject was a responder based on ≥8-point mean improvement in the MSWS-12 over 24 weeks (120  subjects),  or  the  PPV,  was  61.1%.  Of  subjects  who  were  responders  based  on  ≥8-point  mean improvement  in  the  MSWS-12  over  24  weeks  (136  subjects),  the  probability  that  a  subject  had  any improvement on the MSWS-12 at Week 2, or sensitivity, was 88.3%.

Among subjects who had no improvement on the MSWS-12 at Week 2 (118 subjects), the probability that a subject was also not a responder based on ≥8-point mean improvement in the MSWS-12 over 24 weeks (102  subjects),  or  the  NPV,  was  86.5%.    Of  subjects  who  were  not  responders  over  24  weeks,  the probability that a subject had no improvement on the MSWS-12 at Week 2, or specificity, was 57.2%.

Among subjects  treated  with  fampridine-PR,  any  improvement  in  TUG  speed  at  Week  2  or  4  showed reasonable  PPV  and  strong  NPV  for  the  response  (≥15%  improvement)  over  the  24-  week  treatment period.  Early  improvement  in  TUG  speed  did  not  have  strong predictive  values  for  MSWS-12  response over 24 weeks and early improvement in MSWS-12 did not have strong predictive values for TUG speed response over 24 weeks. A composite definition of early response, including any improvement in either measure,  did  not  have  any  stronger  predictive  power  than  the  definition  including  the  given  endpoint alone.

## CONCLUSION

The  Enhance  study  met  its  primary  and  first  2  secondary  endpoints,  showing  statistically  significant differences  between  the  treatment  groups  in  improvements  on  MSWS-12,  TUG  speed,  and  MSIS-29 physical component score results, and trends in favour of treatment with prolonged release fampridine in the BBS and ABILHAND assessments and several exploratory assessments.

In general, treatment response was evident across patient-reported and clinician assessed measures of walking ability as early as Week 2 and was sustained throughout the treatment period and then returned to  baseline  after  treatment  was  stopped in the post-treatment follow-up period. Results of analyses in subgroups defined by demographic or baseline disease characteristics were consistent with those for the overall study population.

Other  analyses  support  the  use  of  assessments  performed  at  approximately  2  or  4  weeks  after  the initiation of treatment to predict the likelihood of longer-term response.

These  findings  were  supported  in  a  variety  of  sensitivity  analyses,  including  one  performed  excluding subjects  with  prior  AP  use,  which  indicated  that  the  improvement  shown  among  subjects  treated  with prolonged-release fampridine was not dependent upon any greater propensity to benefit among subjects with prior AP treatment.

The findings in the ENHANCE trial were consistent with previous study results of fampridine-PR as well as with experience in clinical use, and confirm that fampridine-PR treatment results in clinically meaningful improvements in walking for MS patients with pre-existing walking disability.

## 4.2.3. Discussion

As part of CMA the Applicant conducted the ENHANCE study which now has been completed. The aim of the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  clinical  meaningfulness  of  the  effect  of  fampridine  in  terms  of  walking ability as well as the long term efficacy and safety.

The ENHANCE study concerned a randomised placebo controlled parallel group study in 636 subjects with multiple sclerosis and walking disability. Subjects were randomised to placebo or fampridine PR 10 mg BID. Duration of double-blind was 24 weeks with a 2 week post-treatment follow-up. Primary endpoint was the proportion responders defined as a subject with a mean improvement on the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale of ≥ 8 points as compared to baseline. If a subject's mean MSWS-12 was &lt;8 points at baseline, the subject was counted as having a ≥8-point mean improvement from baseline if their mean MSWS-12 score during the treatment period was &lt;0.5.

A main inclusion criterion was the presence of a walking impairment as deemed by the investigator. This appears rather subjective. However, considering the baseline EDSS score and baseline MSWS-12 scores (table 4.2.2.1b) this is not an issue.

An improvement of 8 points on the MSWS-12 has been accepted as a clinical meaningful change in earlier assessment of the study protocol of the ENHANCE study. This was based on the results of the MOBILE study. In this pilot study the impact of fampridine PR on overall walking disability was evaluated over a 24 weeks in a 132 patients. Using the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and other anchor and distribution-based analyses, the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) on the 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12) was estimated at 8 points.  However, the relevance of the MCID for improvement of Timed Up and Go i.e. ≥15% mean increase in speed over a 24-week treatment period has been questioned in the same assessment. This appears to be confirmed by current data . See TABLE 4.2.2.2.b Results main secondary outcomes.

The ENHANCE study met its primary endpoint. The responder rate was 33.6% for placebo and 43.2% for fampridine PR 10 mg BID (Risk difference 10.4%, CI95% 3%; 17.8%, p=0.006). The  LS mean change in MSWS  score  was-6.73  point  and-2.59  points  in  subjects  treated  with  fampridine  PR  and  placebo respectively  (Difference  -4.14,    CI95%  -6.22,  -2.06;  p  &lt;  0.001).  The  effect  of  prolonged-release fampridine  treatment  was  evident  as  early  as  week  2,  and  was  sustained  throughout  the  24-week treatment period (see figure 1). Upon discontinuation of double-blind treatment after 24 weeks, scores worsened among subjects treated with prolonged-release fampridine but not among those treated with placebo. Of note in the earlier 12 weeks studies the MSWS-12 was measured as secondary endpoint. In study MS-F203 the mean change from baseline (BLscore71.1) under fampridine was -2.84 points. In study MS-F204 the change from baseline (BLscore 73.8) was -2.77 points.

Efficacy on the primary endpoint was consistent with the findings with respect to the TUG responders and MSIS29-physical  score.  There  were  no  statistical  significant  differences  with  respect  to  the  BBS  and ABILHAND. The proportion of subjects reporting an improvement on the PGIC was at Week 2 was 31% vs 38% for placebo and fampridine PR respectively. This was 22% and 28% at week 24.  Findings for the EQ-5D-3L, SDMT, SF-36, and HRU showed relatively little change from baseline and minimal differences between the groups. The results with respect to PGIC are unexpected as this assessment instrument as part of the validation of the relevance  of the MSWS-responders i.e. the relevance of a 8 point shift from baseline MSWS-12. The results with respect to the Berg Balance Scale are also unexpected considering the results of the pilot study and the results of the TUG assessment. The BBS and TUG both assesses balance.

Results with respect to the subgroups were consistent although for subjects with greater disability, the effects size are smaller (see figure 2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Nevertheless the effect size observed is modest. The absolute 14.5% difference in responders assuming a 50% response rate under the null hypothesis was not met, the cumulative distribution curves of points change  from  baseline  only  slightly  separated  (see  figure  3)  and  there  was  little  change  the  several secondary endpoints.

In the earlier fampridine studies (studies MS-F203 &amp; MS-F204) a responder was defined as a patient who consistently had a faster walking speed for at least three visits out of a possible four during the double blind  period  as  compared  to  the  maximum  value  among  five  non-double  blind  off-treatment  visits. Walking speed was measured by the Timed 25-foot Walk. In study MS-F203 responder rates was 8.3% versus  35%  for  placebo  and  fampridine  respectively.  For  study  MS-F204  responder  rates  were  9.3%. versus 43% respectively. It is noted that in the ENHANCE study responders rate in the placebo group is much higher. This may reflects the difference between a more objective (T25FT) and subjective (MSWS12) assessment of response.

Whereas the clinical meaningfulness of the walking speed as primary endpoint was questioned (reason for the  CMA)  it  points  at  the  fact  that  not  all  patient  respond  on  fampridine.  This  is  confirmed  in  the ENHANCE  study.  This  is  not  unexpected.  Walking  disability  in  multiple  sclerosis  is  the  result  of combination of axonal loss and dysfunction of demyelinated axons. Fampridine only affects the latter.

Unfortunately the positive predictive value of any improvement on the MSWS-12 at week 2 or 4 is not large  i.e.  61%  and  59% respectively.  However,  the  negative  predictive  of  lack  of  any  improvement  is reasonable i.e. 87% and 86% for lack of any response at week 2 and 4 respectively. Different cut-off values for improvement on the MSWS-12 or combination of MSWS-TUG  did not lead to better values. For subjects  with  greater  disability,  the  effects  size  are  smaller  than  for  the  overall  population.  This emphasises  the  need  stopping  rules.    In  the  current  SPC  it  is  stated  that  the  initial  prescription  of fampridine  should  be  limited  to  2  weeks  of  therapy  as  clinical  benefits  should  generally  be  identified within 2-weeks after starting treatment. The timed walking test (T25FW) is recommended as assessment instrument. If no improvement is observed fampridine should be discontinued. In addition it is stated that the  benefits  of  fampridine  should  be  reassessed  if  a  decline  in  walking  ability  is  observed.  This  reevaluation should include withdrawal of fampridine should be discontinued if patients no longer receive walking benefit. There seems no reason to change the concept.  i.e. when no improvement is seen within 2-4 weeks continuing fampridine is not useful and users should be re-evaluated if a decline in walking ability is observed.

In  conclusion  the  results  of  the  ENHANCE  study  confirm  that  treatment  with  fampridine  results  in  a clinically meaningful improvement in a proportion of patients with multiple sclerosis with walking abilities. The aim of the ENHANCE study i.e. to evaluate the clinical meaningfulness of the effect of fampridine in terms of walking ability and to evaluate long term efficacy is considered met. Efficacy was maintained over 24 weeks and disappeared after stopping treatment. Early detection of non-responders facilitates the decision to discontinue treatment. However, it is also confirmed that the effect remains modest.

## 4.3. Clinical Safety aspects

## 4.3.1. ENHANCE (study 218MS305)

This Summary of Clinical Safety summarizes the findings from the Phase 3 Study 218MS305 (Study 305) and the pregnancy registry Study 218MS402 (FOLLOW).

The latter study was initiated in 2011 and the first subject was enrolled on 18 August 2015. The study was  stopped  by  agreement  with  the  PRAC  due  to  lack  of  subject  exposure  to  fampridine-PR  during pregnancy. At the time of study closure on 23 March 2016, 1 patient was enrolled in the registry.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  safety  data  base  included  635  subjects,  316  receiving  fampridine  and  319  receiving  placebo.  The mean  duration  of  exposure  to  fampridine-PR  was  22.6  (SD  4.72)  weeks.  Most  fampridine-PR-treated subjects  (98.7%)  complied  with  dosing  of  study  treatment.  The  majority  of  fampridine-PR-treated subjects  (85%)  took  between ≥ 90%  to ≤ 100%  of  study  treatment.  Exposure  and  compliance  were similar for the placebo-treated subjects.

Fampridine-PR and placebo-treated groups were balanced with respect to demographics. The mean age of fampridine-PR-treated subjects 49.0 (SD 9.82) with the majority of subjects ≤ 64 years old; 59% were female; and the mean body mass index was 25.6 kg/m 2 . Most subjects did not report race and ethnicity due  to  confidentiality  regulations.  Similarly,  the  baseline  disease  characteristics  of  the  fampridine-PRtreated safety population and the placebo groups were comparable. See table 1b.

Concomitant medication used was comparable between the safety population and the placebo group. The most common medications used by ≥ 10% of fampridine-PR-treated subjects included baclofen (21%), colecalciferol  (15%),  tizanidine,  methylprednisolone  (11%  each),  ibuprofen,  and  paracetamol  (10% each).

In table 4.3.1.1 a general overview of the adverse events is presented.

The  incidence  of  AEs  reported  in  Study  305  was  similar  between  the  2  treatment  groups  (66% fampridine-PR, 60% placebo). Most subjects had AEs that were considered mild or moderate in severity, and the incidence of AEs that were considered severe was the same (3%) in each treatment group. The incidence of AEs related to study treatment was higher in fampridine-PR-treated subjects than in placebotreated subjects (18% vs. 13%).

One subject in each group had an AE that led to death during the study (i.e., during the 2-week follow-up period after the end of treatment); 2 additional deaths (1 subject in each group) occurred after the end of the study.

Serious events also occurred at a similar incidence (8% vs. 7%). The incidence of AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation (7% each group) or withdrawal from the study (8% vs. 7%) was also balanced. The incidence of AEs leading to dose interruption was slightly higher for fampridine-PR-treated subjects than for those treated with placebo (6% vs. 3%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Common  adverse  events  and  some  adverse  events  interest  (by  assessor)  are  presented  with  table 4.3.1.2.

Most the most common system organ class for reported AEs were infections and infestations (31% vs. 28%), nervous system disorders (27% vs. 21%), and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (18% vs. 13%). In addition there were more AEs reported for gastrointestinal disorders for fampridinePR-treated subjects (14% vs. 8%).

The most common AEs among nervous system disorders were MS relapse, headache, and dizziness, and the most common AEs among musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders were back pain, arthralgia, and  pain  in  extremity.  Otherwise,  the  incidence  of  AEs  in  particular  system  organ  class  was  similar between the 2 treatment groups.

The most frequently reported AEs in both treatment groups were MS relapse and urinary tract infection, consistent with the MS study population. The AEs that occurred at an incidence ≥3% among fampridinePR-treated subjects compared with the placebo group were UTI and insomnia. No other AEs were more common among subjects treated with placebo than among those treated with fampridine-PR.

|---------------------|------|------|

## Adverse Events by Severity

The majority of AEs in the fampridine-PR and placebo groups were considered to be mild (30% vs. 29% placebo) or moderate (33% vs. 28%) in severity. The incidence of AEs considered severe was the same for  the  2  treatment  groups  (3%  each).  The  following  severe  events  occurred  in  &lt;1%  (1  subject)  of fampridine-PR  treated  subjects:  UTI,  diverticulitis,  gallbladder  empyema,  breast  cancer,  MS  relapse, balance disorder, MS, coronary artery stenosis, constipation, pain in extremity, chest pain, white blood cell count (WBC) increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, hemoglobin decreased, and neutrophil count increased.

## Treatment related Adverse Events

Most AEs in both treatment groups were considered not related to study treatment (48% vs. 46%). The incidence of AEs considered related to study treatment in the fampridine-PR group was 18% as compared with 13% in the placebo group.

## Deaths

Four  events  with  a  fatal  outcome  (2  per  treatment  group)  were  reported  during  or  shortly  after completion of the study. All deaths occurred after the subject discontinued study treatment. The events leading to death were considered not related to study treatment. Events of coronary artery stenosis (n=1, fampridine-PR group) and acute myocardial infarction (n=1, placebo group) led to fatal outcomes that occurred prior to the end of the 2-week post-treatment follow-up period. Events of lung cancer with liver and brain metastasis (n=1, fampridine-PR) and ovarian endometrioid carcinoma (n=1, placebo) led to death that occurred after the 2-week follow-up period after the last dose of study treatment.

## Other Serious Adverse Events

In Study 305, the incidence of SAEs was comparable between the 2 treatment groups (8% vs.7%). MS relapse was the most frequently reported SAE in both groups (4% [14 subjects] vs. 3% [10 subjects]). All other SAEs in both groups occurred at a low frequency of &lt;1%.

Excluding  MS  relapse,  SAEs  reported  in  the  fampridine-PR  group  were  UTI,  fall  (2  subjects  each), diverticulitis, gallbladder empyema, bladder cancer, breast cancer, uterine leiomyoma, vertigo  positional, coronary  artery  stenosis,  peripheral  ischemia,  chest  pain,  humerus  fracture,  and  joint  dislocation  (1 subject each).

Excluding MS relapse, serious events reported in the placebo group were fall (2 subjects), UTI, injection site  infection,  ovarian  endometrioid  carcinoma,  dizziness,  anxiety,  mental  disorder,  acute  myocardial infarction,  atrioventricular  block  second  degree,  intervertebral  disc  disorder,  abortion  spontaneous, endometrial atrophy, metrorrhagia, ankle fracture, and femur fracture (1 subject each).

Other than the SAEs of anxiety and mental disorder experienced by one subject in the placebo group, none of the other SAEs were considered related to study treatment.

## Adverse Events leading to discontinuation or dose interruption

The incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment or study withdrawal was comparable between the 2 treatment groups (7% vs. 8%). MS relapse and MS led to discontinuation or withdrawal (MS relapse, 3 subjects vs. 1 subject; MS, 2 fampridine-PR-treated subjects).

Excluding  the  events  of  MS  relapse  and  MS,  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  or  withdrawal  in  the fampridine-PR group were creatinine renal clearance decreased (5 subjects), pain in extremity (2 subjects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

each),  UTI,  breast  cancer,  anxiety,  insomnia,  balance  disorder,  vertigo,  coronary  artery  stenosis, constipation, renal impairment, asthenia, fatigue, gastric pH increased, and fall (1 subject each).

Excluding the events of MS relapse and MS, AEs leading to discontinuation or withdrawal in the placebo group  were  creatinine  renal  clearance  decreased  (6  subjects),  trigeminal  neuralgia  (2  subjects),  UTI, injection site infection, ovarian endometrioid carcinoma, tension, acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, palpitations,  drug  eruption,  limb  discomfort,  muscle  spasms,  renal  impairment,  chest  pain,  creatinine renal clearance abnormal, and femur fracture (1 subject each).

The  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  dose  interruption  was  6%  and  3%  in  the  fampridine-PR  and  placebo groups, respectively. The incidence of SAEs leading to dose interruption was low (&lt;1%).

AEs  leading  to  dose  interruption  in  the  fampridine-PR  group  were  nausea  (3  subjects),  UTI,  fall  (2 subjects  each),  diverticulitis,  gallbladder  empyema,  gastroenteritis,  influenza,  lower  respiratory  tract infection,  nasopharyngitis,  balance  disorder,  migraine,  MS  relapse,  constipation,  dyspepsia,  pruritus generalized,  rash,  back  pain,  pain  in  extremity,  micturition  urgency,  chest  pain,  creatinine  clearance abnormal, creatinine clearance decreased, contusion, and laceration (1 subject each)

AEs  leading  to  dose  interruption  that  occurred  in  the  placebo  group  were  MS  relapse  (2  subjects), gastroenteritis, pneumonia, tooth abscess, viral infection, anxiety, insomnia, panic attack, hemianaesthesia, motion sickness, cough, nausea, food poisoning, rash, and myalgia (1 subject each)

## Adverse Events of Special Interest

Adverse events of special interest include seizures, hypersensitivity, urinary tract infection, cardiac events and AEs related to creatinine clearance (CrCl). In table 4.3.1.3. the occurrence of the events of special interests is summarised.

## Adverse Events in Subgroups of Interest

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To identify potential drug-drug interactions, AEs of subjects who received any concomitant Organic cation transport 2 (OCT2) inhibitors, OCT2 substrates, concomitant medications with a potential to lower seizure threshold, or anti-epileptic agents affecting the sodium-potassium current were evaluated.  AEs were also evaluated  as  a  function  of  subjects'  CrCl  at  screening.  In  addition,  AEs  in  subjects  who  had  a  Postbaseline CrCl value &lt;80 mL/min were assessed.

The incidence of AEs in the specified concomitant medications subgroups was similar for each treatment group. No patterns were observed in AEs reported for fampridine-treated subjects receiving the specified concomitant medications. No events of seizure or convulsion activity were reported for fampridine-PRand placebo-treated subjects in any of these subgroups.

## Concomitant OCT2 inhibitors

In this subgroup, AEs were reported for 27 of 30 subjects (90%) in the fampridine-PR group and 26 of 27 subjects (96%) in the placebo group. UTI was reported for 3 and 5 fampridine-PR- and placebo-treated subjects,  respectively,  rash  was  reported  for  2  and  1  subjects,  MS  relapse  was  reported  for  16  and  9 subjects,  hypoesthesia  was  reported  for  3  and  1  subjects,  and  balance  disorder  was  reported  for  1 subject  in  each  group.  Cardiac  disorders  were  reported  in  2  fampridine-PR-treated  subjects  who  also received  concomitant  OCT2  inhibitors  (extrasystoles  and  tachycardia,  1  subject;  atrioventricular  block first degree, 1 subject) and in 1 placebo-treated subject.

## Concomitant OCT2 substrates

AEs  were  reported  for  22  of  29  (76%)  fampridine-PR-treated  subjects  and  10  of  15  (67%)  placebotreated  subjects  who  received  concomitant  OCT2  substrates,  i.e.,  any  medication  coded  to  carvedilol, propranolol, metformin, amantadine, or varenicline (use of cimetidine was not reported for any subject). UTI was reported for 5 and 0 fampridine-PR- and placebo-treated subjects, respectively, headache was reported  for  2  and  0  subjects,  balance  disorder  was  reported  for  1  and  0  subjects,  tachycardia  was reported for 1 and 0 subjects, constipation was reported for 3 and 0 subjects, micturition urgency was reported for  2  and  0  subjects,  increased  creatinine  renal  clearance  was  reported  for  1  and  0  subjects asthenia  was  reported  for  4  and  0  patients,  fall  was  reported  for  3  and  1  subjects,  and  vertigo  was reported for 1 subject in each group.

## Concomitant medications with a potential to lower seizure threshold

Among subjects  who  received  potential  seizure  threshold-lowering  medications,  AEs  were  reported  for 135 of 165 subjects (82%) in the fampridine-PR group and 113 of 157 subjects (72%) in the placebo group. No seizure or convulsion activity was reported among these subjects. Nervous system disorders reported for 38% and 33% of subjects in the fampridine-PR and placebo groups, respectively, included MS relapse (19% [32 subjects] fampridine-PR, 18% [29 subjects] placebo), dizziness (4% [7 subjects] fampridine-PR,  4%  [6  subjects]  placebo),  and  headache  (6%  [7  subjects]  fampridine-PR),  4%  [10 subjects] placebo).

## Concomitant anti-epileptic agents affecting the sodium-potassium

In this subgroup, AEs were reported for 32 of 43 subjects (74%) in the fampridine-PR group and 32 of 44 subjects  (73%)  in  the  placebo  group.  No  seizure  or  convulsion  activity  was  reported  among  these subjects.  Nervous  system  disorders  reported  for  33%  and  32%  of  fampridine-PR  and  placebo-treated subjects, respectively, included MS relapse (12% [5 subjects] fampridine-PR, 14% [6 subjects] placebo).

Creatinine clearance at screening (&lt;80 mL/min, ≥80 mL/min)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Four subjects in each group had screening CrCl &lt;80 mL/min of whom 2 subjects in the fampridine-PR group and 3 subjects in the placebo group had at least 1 AE of any type during the study. Notable nonserious  AEs  in  this  subgroup  were  abnormal  creatinine  renal  clearance  and  micturition  urgency  (both events reported in 1 fampridine-treated and decreased creatinine renal clearance (reported for 2 placebotreated subjects).

## Any post-baseline creatinine clearance &lt;80 mL/min

In this subgroup, AEs were reported for 31 of 39 subjects (79%) in the fampridine-PR group and 30 of 41 subjects (73%) in the placebo group (73%). No seizure or convulsion activity was reported among these subjects.  Arrhythmia  was  reported  for  1  subject  treated  with  placebo,  and  atrioventricular  block  first degree was reported for 1 subject treated with fampridine-PR.

## Clinical laboratory evaluations

There were no clinically meaningful changes in group mean laboratory hematology, blood chemistry and there  was  no  clear  pattern  in  the  occurrence  of  abnormal  values,  including  numbers  of  shifts  from baseline.

## Vital signs, physical findings and other observations related to safety

There were notable changes in vital signs were observed during the study.

ECG: Two subjects treated with fampridine-PR had a normal ECG at baseline and a shift to an abnormal ECG that was considered an AE. Neither event was serious, and both were considered mild in severity and not  related  to  study  treatment.  Shifts  from  normal  to  abnormal  (but  not  an  AE)  were  reported  for  16 fampridine-PR-treated subjects and 20 placebo-treated subjects.

MS-relapse: Suspected MS relapse was reported for 31 subjects (10%) treated with fampridine-PR (27 of whom were treated with methylprednisolone) and for 28 subjects (9%) treated with placebo (15 of whom were treated with methylprednisolone).

Overdose: Three subjects (2 treated with fampridine-PR and 1 treated with placebo) mistakenly took a double  dose  during  the  study.  Four  subjects  (2  in  each  group)  did  not  have  confirmed  overdose  but returned fewer tablets than expected at a compliance check, and it was not clear whether the tablets were lost or the subject took extra tablets. No AEs as a result of overdose were reported.

## CONCLUSION

The Applicant concludes that the safety findings for fampridine-PR in Study 305 are consistent with the known  safety  profile  of  fampridine-PR  as  observed  in  previous  clinical  trials  and  post-marketing experience.  Review of the Study 305 safety data with respect to the important risks of seizures, serious hypersensitivity, UTIs, and interactions with OCT2 inhibitors did not reveal any new safety findings. No unexpected AEs were observed in Study 305, and there are no new safety signals with potential impact to the benefit-risk assessment of fampridine.

## Discussion

It was concluded that the observed safety profile in study 305 was not different from what was already known and that no new signals were raised.

## 4.3.2. Follow registry

The primary objective of the FOLLOW registry (Study 218MS402) was to evaluate the outcomes of pregnancy in women with multiple sclerosis (MS) who were exposed to prolonged-release fampridine since the first day of their last menstrual period (LMP) prior to conception or at any time during pregnancy.

In agreement with the PRAC 10 September 2015 (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001352/201501), the study was terminated early due to lack of subject exposure to prolonged-release fampridine during pregnancy. The PRAC agreed with the Applicant proposal of using a targeted follow-up pregnancy questionnaire in all cases (maternal/paternal exposure during pregnancy) reported to the Applicant.

At the time of study closure (23 March 2016), only 1 patient was enrolled in the registry.

## Discussion

The MAH provided the final study report of the FOLLOW registry which was terminated early following the PRAC recommendation in PSUSA procedure EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001352/201501. One patient was enrolled As agreed in PSUSA procedure EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001352/201501 all future pregnancy cases will be followed using a targeted follow-up pregnancy questionnaire.

## 4.4. Risk management plan

As submission of the ENHANCE data fulfils the specific obligation, the MAH requests to convert the marketing authorisation from conditional to a full licence.

The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application. The main proposed RMP changes were the following:

- -Updated information (results) on the completed study ENHANCE (218MS305)
- -Removed the safety concern Lack of efficacy from the missing information section based on ENHANCE data

The MAH has also taken the opportunity to remove redundant information to improve readability.

## Safety concerns

Removed text indicated by strikethrough. New text is underlined.

Long-term efficacy (which had been included as missing information) has been removed by the MAH. As part of the conditional approval long-term efficacy data should be obtained from the ENHANCE study: a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, long-term efficacy and safety study to investigate a broader primary endpoint clinically meaningful in terms of walking ability and to further evaluate the early identification of responders in order to guide further treatment. As the obligatory ENHANCE study has been finalised, the MAH removed long-term efficacy as missing information. This is accepted, depending of the outcome of the CHMP discussion on the results of this study.

The PRAC Rapporteur is of the opinion that the proposed post-authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product, depending on the outcome of the CHMP discussion on long-term efficacy (ENHANCE study).

The PRAC Rapporteur also considers that the studies in the post-authorisation development plan remain sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures (RMMs).

| Seizure                 | Text in SmPC: Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment with Fampyra is restricted to prescription and supervision by physicians experienced im the management of MS. The recommended dose is one 10 mg tablet, twice daily, taken 12 hours apart (onel tablet in the moming and enel tablet in the evening). Fampyra should not be administered more frequently or at higher doses tham recommended (see section 4.4). The tablets shouldcan be taken with or without food (see section 5.2) Initial prescription shouldbe limited to 2 to 4 weeks of therapy as climical benefits should generally be identified withim 2-to 4 weeks after starting Fampyra A timedAn assessment of walking testability, e.g-_ the Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW);, or MSWS-12. is recommended to evaluate improvement after twvo-within 2 to 4 weeks. Ifno improvement is observed, Fampyra should be discontimued Fampyra should be discontinued if benefit is notreported by patients. If decline in walking ability is observed, physicians should benefits ofFampyra (see above). The re-evaluation should include withdrawal of Fampyra and perfomimg thean assessment of walking test.ability. Fampyra should be discontinued if patients no longer receive walking benefit. The usual dosing regimeregimen should always be followed. A double dose should not be taken if a dose is missed.

|                         | Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Seizure risk Treatment with fampridime increases seizure risk (see section 4.8). Fampyra should be administered with caution in the presence of any factors which may lower seizure threshold. Fampyra should be discontimued im patients who experience a seizure while on treatment. Section 4.8 Undesirable effects Description of selected adverse reactions Seizure In post-marketing experience, there have been reports of seizure, the frequency is not kmown (cannot be estimated from the available data). For further imformation on seizure risk, please refer to sections 4.3 and 4.4. Section 4.9 Overdose Symptoms Acute symptoms of overdose with Fampyra were consistent with central nervous system excitation and imcluded confusion, tremulousness, diaphoresis, seizure, and amnesia. Central nervous system side effects at high doses of 4- aminopyridine-AP imclude confusion, seizures, status epilepticus, involuntary and choreoathetoid movements. Management Patients who overdose shouldbe provided supportive care. Repeated seizure activity should be treated with benzodiazepine. phenytoin, or other appropriate acute anti-seizure therapy.

|                         | secretion accounting for about 60% (see section 5.2). OCT2 is the transporter responsible for the active secretion of fampridine. Thus, the concomitant use of fampridine with medicinal products that are imhibitors of OCT2 for example, cimetidine are contraindicated (see section 4.3) amd concomitant use of fampridine with medicinal products that are substrates of OCT2 for example, carvedilol, propanolol. and metformin is cautioned (see section 4.4.) Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Elimination: The major route of elimination for fampridine is renal excretion, with approximately 90% of the dose recovered im urine as parent medicinal product withim 24 hours. Renal clearance (CLR 370 lmL/min) is substantially greater than glomerular filtration rate due to combined glomerular filtration and active excretion by the renal OCT2 transporter. Faecal excretion accounts forless than 1% of the admimistered dose. Fampyra is characterized by linear (dose-proportional) pharmacokinetiesPKs with a teminal elimination half-life of approximately 6 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (The Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) increase proportionately with dose. There is no evidence of climically relevant accumulation of fampridime taken at the recommended dose in patients with full renal function. In patients with renal impaiment, accumulation occurs relative to the degree of impaiment. Patients with renal impairment: Fampridime is eliminated primarily by the kidneys as unchanged medicinal product and therefore renal fumction should be checked im patients where renal function might be compromised. Patients with mild renal impairment can be expected to have approximately 1.7 to 1.9 times the fampridine concentrations achieved by patients with nomal renal function. Fampyra must not be administered to patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impaiment (see section 4.3). |                                                                    |

The PRAC Rapporteur is of the opinion that the proposed RMMs remain sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication(s).

Please include only a brief summary of the SmPC text in the summary table of risk minimisation measures, instead of the exact wording, in order to avoid unnecessary updates of the RMP.

## Elements for a public summary of the RMP

The elements for a public summary of the RMP have been updated accordingly.

## Annexes

The annexes have been updated appropriately.

## Overall conclusion on the RMP

The changes to the RMP are considered acceptable, depending on the outcome of the CHMP discussion on the results of the ENHANCE study on long-term efficacy.

The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu.

## 4.5. Changes to the Product Information

Red indicates additions and strike through indicates deletions as proposed by the MAH initially.

Blue indicates additions and strike through indicates deletions as proposed by the Rapporteur with the Request for Supplementary Information.

<!-- image -->

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## CHMP comment

The  MAH  proposed  to  remove  the  product  from  the  list  of  products  with  additional  monitoring  (see removal  additional  monitoring  and  black  triangle  from  the  SmPC).  This  was  agreed  as  there  are  no outstanding conditions to the MA and the active substance has been authorised for more than 5 years.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Fampyra 10 mg prolonged-release tablets

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each prolonged-release tablet contains 10 mg of fampridine.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Prolonged-release tablet.

An off-white, film coated, oval biconvex 13 x 8 mm tablet with flat edge debossed with A10 on one side.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Fampyra is indicated for the improvement of walking in adult patients with multiple sclerosis with walking disability (EDSS 4-7).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment with Fampyra is restricted to prescription and supervision by physicians experienced in the management of MS.

## Posology

The recommended dose is one 10 mg tablet, twice daily, taken 12 hours apart (one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the evening). Fampyra should not be administered more frequently or at higher doses than recommended (see section 4.4). The tablets should can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). The tablets should be taken without food (see section 5.2).

## CHMP comment 1 st  round

Insufficient justification is provided in support of this change i.e.

The guidance regarding administration with food has been clarified in line with the Core Data  Sheet (CDS) that  was  amended to  'can  be  taken  with  or  without  food'  in  version  04  (14  September  2012).  The  CDS update was included with submission of PSUR 03. On review of PSUR 03 (EMEA/H/C/2097/PSU 004, PRAC maintenance recommendation 05 September 2013), PRAC recommended the SmPC be updated to align with the CDS'

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However this  was  apparently  was  general  recommendation.  With  respect  to  the  claim  of  'no  clinically meaningful  consequences  when  administered  with  food'  it  was  stated  that  should  comment  on  the differences in this respect between the US and EU labelling and reconsider the need of a type II variation to update the EU SmPC.

Hence  the  Applicant  should  provided  a  further  justification  for  this  change  or  the  current  text  should remain.

## Applicant's response

The  applicant  dropped  the  initial  proposal: The  tablets  should  can  be  taken  with  or  without  food (see section 5.2) and reintroduced the original text: The tablets should be taken without food (see section 5.2).

## Assessment of the response

Resolved

## Starting and Evaluating Fampyra Treatment

- Initial prescription should be limited to two to four  2 weeks of therapy as clinical benefits should generally be identified within two to four  2 weeks after starting Fampyra
- A timed walking test An assessment of walking ability, e.g. the Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW) or Twelve Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12), is recommended to evaluate improvement after two weeks within two to four weeks. If no improvement is observed,  Fampyra should be discontinued Fampyra should be discontinued if benefit is not reported by patients.

## Re-Evaluating Fampyra Treatment

If decline in walking ability is observed, physicians should consider an interruption to treatment in order to reassess the benefits of Fampyra (see above). The re-evaluation should include withdrawal of Fampyra and performing the walking test an assessment of walking ability. Fampyra should be discontinued if patients no longer receive walking benefit.

## CHMP comment 1 st  round

Agreed changes are consistent with results of the ENHANCE studies.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to fampridine or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Concurrent treatment with other medicinal products containing fampridine (4-aminopyridine).

Patients with prior history or current presentation of seizure.

Patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearances &lt;80 ml/min).

Concomitant use of Fampyra with medicinal products that are inhibitors of Organic Cation Transporter 2 (OCT2) for example, cimetidine.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Seizure risk

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment with fampridine increases seizure risk (see section 4.8).

Fampyra should be administered with caution in the presence of any factors which may lower seizure threshold.

Fampyra should be discontinued in patients who experience a seizure while on treatment.

## Renal impairment

Fampyra is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Patients with renal impairment have higher plasma concentrations which are associated with increased adverse reactions, in particular neurological effects. Determining renal function before treatment and its regular monitoring during treatment is recommended in all patients (particularly in older people in whom renal function might be reduced). Creatinine clearance can be estimated using the Cockroft-Gault formula.

Fampyra should not be administered to patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;80 ml/min) (see section 4.3).

Caution is required when Fampyra is prescribed concurrently with medicinal products that are substrates of OCT2 for example, carvedilol, propanolol and metformin.

## Hypersensitivity Reactions

In post-marketing experience, serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic reaction) have been reported, the majority of these cases occurred within the first week of treatment.  Particular attention should be given to patients with a previous history of allergic reactions.  If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, Fampyra should be discontinued and not restarted.

## Other warnings and precautions

Fampyra should be administered with caution to patients with cardiovascular symptoms of rhythm and sinoatrial or atrioventricular conduction cardiac disorders (these effects are seen in overdose). There is limited safety information in these patients.

The increased incidence of dizziness and balance disorder seen with Fampyra may result in an increased risk of falls. Therefore, patients should use walking aids as needed.

In clinical studies low white blood cell counts were seen in 2.1% of Fampyra patients versus 1.9% of patients on placebo. Infections were seen in the clinical studies as stated below. An increased infection rate and impairment of the immune response cannot be excluded.

## Member state  comment 1 st  round

The table above seems to be doubling that of section 4.8 and might be considered confusing as it doesn't reflect adverse reactions but adverse events. This is endorsed by the Rapporteur and the table should be deleted.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

Concurrent treatment with other medicinal products containing fampridine (4-aminopyridine) is contraindicated (see section 4.3).

Fampridine is eliminated mainly via the kidneys with active renal secretion accounting for about 60% (see section 5.2). OCT2 is the transporter responsible for the active secretion of fampridine. Thus, the concomitant use of fampridine with medicinal products that are inhibitors of OCT2 for example, cimetidine are contraindicated (see section 4.3) and concomitant use of fampridine with medicinal products that are substrates of OCT2 for example, carvedilol, propanolol and metformin is cautioned (see section 4.4.)

Interferon: fampridine has been administered concomitantly with interferon-beta and no pharmacokinetic medicinal product interactions were observed.

Baclofen: fampridine has been administered concomitantly with baclofen and no pharmacokinetic medicinal product interactions were observed.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of fampridine in pregnant women.

Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure it is preferable to avoid the use of Fampyra in pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether fampridine is excreted in human or animal milk. Fampyra is not recommended during breast-feeding.

## Fertility

In animal studies no effects on fertility were seen.

## CHMP comment  1 st  round

Preferred is: There are limited data from the use of fampridine in pregnant women.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Fampyra has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines because Fampyra can cause dizziness.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

The safety of Fampyra has been evaluated in randomised controlled clinical studies, in open label long term studies and in the post marketing setting.

Adverse reactions identified are mostly neurological and include seizure, insomnia, anxiety, balance disorder, dizziness, paraesthesia, tremor, headache and asthenia. This is consistent with fampridine's pharmacological activity. The highest incidence of adverse reactions identified from placebo-controlled trials in multiple sclerosis patients with Fampyra given at the recommended dose, are reported as urinary tract infection (in approximately 12% of patients).

Adverse reactions are presented below by system organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions

## Seizure

In post-marketing experience, there have been reports of seizure, the frequency is not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). For further information on seizure risk, please refer to sections 4.3 and 4.4.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hypersensitivity

In post-marketing experience, there have been reports of hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) which have occurred with one or more of the following: dyspnoea, chest discomfort, hypotension, angioedema, rash and urticaria. For further information on hypersensitivity reactions, please refer to sections 4.3 and 4.4.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## Member state comment 1 st  round:

Palpitations and tachycardia have been noted in ENHANCE and should be reflected in the SmPC which is endorsed by the Rapporteur.  The Applicant should also define the frequency of these adverse reactions.

## Applicant's response

Cardiovascular  disorders  are  an  important  potential  risk  of  fampridine  based  on  the  pharmacologic properties of Fampridine as a potassium channel blocker. It is an important potential risk described in the current  EU  RMP  and  caution  is  advised  in  the  EU  SmPC  when  administering  to  patients  with cardiovascular symptoms (Section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use).

Since the MAHs last review of Cardiac Dysrhythmic events in PSUR 8 (DLP 21 January 2016) new clinical trial  data  from  Study  305  has  become  available  showing:  Cardiac  Dysrhythmic  event:  Fampridine  6 (1.9%) vs Placebo 2 (0.6%), Palpitations: Fampridine 4 (1.3%) vs Placebo 1 (0.3%).

However, the numbers of events is small and the incidence of  palpitations  in  this  study  is  lower  than might be expected in the general population, based on epidemiological data. The data for these events from Study 305 are not supported by that from previous or ongoing studies involving fampridine.

Disproportionality analyses using EB05 scores are not suggestive of a causal relationship and review of post-marketing data remains inconclusive and unchanged.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is concluded by the MAH that on balance that the most recent review of cardiac dysrhythmic events does not reveal any significant new safety information and is consistent with current known risks and labelling. Therefore the MAH concludes that no changes to the prescribing information for fampridine are required.

## Assessment of the response

As stated cardiovascular disorders is an important potential risk of fampridine based on the pharmacologic properties of Fampridine as a potassium channel blocker. This is an argument sufficient on its own for a causal relationship between fampridine use and cardiac dysrhythmic events. Further cardiac arrhythmias and ventricular tachycardia are reported as with an overdose of 4-AP. It is acknowledged that, the numbers of Cardiac Dysrhythmic events reported is small. However there is a consistent higher incidence as compared to placebo.

Considering al this the MAA is requested to incorporate palpitations and tachycardia in section 4.8 with corresponding frequency category.

Issue resolved upon subsequent submission of updated PI by the MAH.

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group:  Other nervous system drugs, ATC code: N07XX07.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Fampyra is a potassium channel blocker. By blocking potassium channels, Fampyra reduces the leakage of ionic current through these channels, thereby prolonging repolarization and thus enhancing action potential formation in demyelinated axons and neurological function. Presumably, by enhancing action potential formation, more impulses might be conducted in the central nervous system.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

Two Three phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled confirmatory studies, (MS-F203 and MS-F204 and 218MS305) have been performed. The proportion of responders was independent of concomitant immunomodulatory therapy (including interferons, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod and natalizumab). The majority of patients in these studies were using immunomodulatory medicines The Fampyra dose was 10 mg BID.

## Studies MS-F203 and MS-F204

The primary endpoint in studies MS-F203 and MS-F204 was the responder rate in walking speed as measured by the Timed 25-foot Walk (T25FW). A responder was defined as a patient who consistently had a faster walking speed for at least three visits out of a possible four during the double blind period as compared to the maximum value among five non-double blind off-treatment visits.

A significantly greater proportion of Fampyra treated patients taking Fampyra 10 mg BID were responders as compared to placebo (MS-F203: 34.8% vs. 8.3%, p&lt;0.001; MS-F204: 42.9% vs. 9.3%, p&lt;0.001).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients who responded to Fampyra increased their walking speed on average by 26.3% vs 5.3% on placebo (p&lt;0.001) (MS-F203) and 25.3% vs 7.8% (p&lt; 0.001) (MS-F204). The improvement appeared rapidly (within weeks) after starting Fampyra.

Statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in walking were seen, as measured by the 12- item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale.

## Study 218MS305

The primary endpoint in study 218MS305 was improvement in walking ability, measured as the proportion of patients achieving a mean improvement of ≥ 8 points from baseline MSWS-12 score over 24 weeks.  In this study there was a statistically significant treatment difference, with a greater proportion of Fampyra treated patients demonstrating an improvement in walking ability, compared to placebo-controlled patients (0.432 vs. 0.336; odds ratio: 1.61; p=0.006).  A higher proportion of Fampyra treated patients displayed improvement in walking ability at all magnitudes of change in MSWS12 score (from 1 to 10 points), compared to placebo.  Improvements generally appeared within 2 to 4 weeks of initiation of treatment, and disappeared within 2 weeks of treatment cessation.

Fampyra treated patients also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, a measure of static and dynamic balance and physical mobility. In this secondary endpoint, a greater proportion of Fampyra treated patients achieved ≥ 15% mean improvement from baseline TUG speed over a 24 week period, compared to placebo (0.434 vs. 0.347; odds ratio: 1.46; p=0.030).

The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), a patient reported outcome (PRO) measure to assess the change from baseline in a patient's physical well-being over 24 weeks, was an additional secondary endpoint in study 218MS305. In this measure, patients treated with Fampyra demonstrated a statistically significant mean improvement from baseline compared to placebo (Least Squares (LS) mean difference 3.31, p&lt;0.001).

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Fampyra in all subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of multiple sclerosis with walking disability (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

The medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called \"conditional approval\" scheme. This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited, in particular about Fampyra's benefits beyond its effects on walking speed and with respect to early identification of responders. A study will be conducted to investigate this. The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.

## Study 218MS305

Study 218MS305 was conducted in 636 subjects with multiple sclerosis and walking disability. Duration of double-blind treatment was 24 weeks with a 2 week post-treatment follow-up. The primary endpoint was

improvement in walking ability, measured as the proportion of patients achieving a mean improvement of ≥ 8 points from baseline MSWS-12 score over 24 weeks.  In this study there was a statistically significant treatment difference, with a greater proportion of Fampyra treated patients demonstrating an improvement in walking ability, compared to placebo-controlled patients (relative risk of 1.38 (95% CI: [1.06, 1.70]).  Improvements generally appeared within 2 to 4 weeks of initiation of treatment, and disappeared within 2 weeks of treatment cessation.

Fampyra treated patients also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, a measure of static and dynamic balance and physical mobility. In this secondary endpoint, a greater proportion of Fampyra treated patients achieved ≥ 15% mean improvement from baseline TUG speed over a 24 week period, compared to placebo (relative risk of 1.25 (95% CI:  [0.99, 1.51]). The mean (SD) TUG time taken at baseline was 27.1 (42.03) seconds for placebo and 24.9 (26.61) seconds for Fampyra. The Least Squares Mean (LSM) change (standard error) over 24 weeks was -1.9 (0.78) seconds for placebo and -3.3 (0.75) seconds for Fampyra. In addition, a positive and sustained treatment effect was observed   The difference in the Berg Balance Scale (BBS; a measure of static balance), although the difference was not statistically significant.

In addition, patients treated with Fampyra demonstrated a statistically significant mean improvement from baseline compared to placebo in the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) physical score (LSM difference -3.31, p&lt;0.001).

## CHMP comment 1 st  round

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The initial information on the study design of the ENHANCE study was considered incomplete. See above. Results should not be expressed in terms of odd-ratio's these exaggerate the treatment. The relevance of the Timed Up and GO responder definition is questioned See discussion. The TUG is claimed as a measure of static and dynamic balance and physical mobility. However no effect was seen on the Berg Balance Scale the preferred scale to measures balance. Endpoints in the table do not have to be recapitulated extensively in the text.  Further the format of the table for the Enhance should be consistent with that of the study MS-F203/204. Considering al this the following text and table is proposed:

## Study 218MS305

Study  218MS30  concerned  a  randomised  double-blind  placebo  controlled  parallel  group  study  in  636 subjects with multiple sclerosis and walking disability. Subjects were randomised to placebo or fampridine PR 10 mg BID. Duration of double-blind was 24 weeks with a 2 week post-treatment follow-up.

The  primary  endpoint  in  study  218MS305  was  improvement  in  walking  ability,  measured  as  the proportion of patients achieving a mean improvement of ≥ 8 points from baseline MSWS-12 score over 24 weeks.

In  this  study  there  was  a  statistically  significant  treatment  difference,  with  a  greater  proportion  of Fampyra  treated  patients  demonstrating  an  improvement  in  walking  ability,  compared  to  placebocontrolled patients (43% vs. 34%.  Improvements generally appeared within 2 to 4 weeks of initiation of treatment,  and  disappeared  within  2  weeks  of  treatment  cessation.  In  addition  patients  treated  with Fampyra demonstrated a statistically significant mean improvement from baseline compared to placebo in the MS-Impact score.

If the Applicant insist on maintaining the TUG responders in the labelling the baseline values and absolute change from baseline should be presented as well. It allows the reader to assess the relevance of a 1.4 second difference in TUG this between placebo and active treatment considering baseline performance is around 26 seconds. Moreover the result on the BBS should be presented for  a balanced assessment. See table 4.2.2.2b results on secondary outcomes .

Further whether the CMA can be converted to a full  MAA will depend on the response to the request for supplementary information

## Applicant's response

The applicant largely adapted the text in accordance to the proposal of the CHMP. See above.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Assessment of the response

The text as proposed is largely agreed but not completely.

The following text is hardly readable hampering interpretation:

The  mean  (SD)  TUG  time  taken  at  baseline  was  27.1  (42.03)  seconds  for  placebo  and  24.9  (26.61) seconds for Fampyra. The Least Squares Mean (LSM) change (standard error) over 24 weeks was -1.9 (0.78)  seconds  for  placebo  and  -3.3  (0.75)  seconds  for  Fampyra. Moreover  an  effect  is  suggested whereas the difference was not statistically significant. Instead the information should be added to the table. See proposal above in blue. This is more readable and allows a better assessment of data by the reader.

Further  that  a  positive  and  sustained  treatment  effect  was  observed  in  the  Berg  Balance  Scale  is misleading. It refers to an improvement from baseline and does not carry information on the magnitude of this change.  More important an effect is suggested whereas the change form baseline was equal in both  groups.  Hence  a  treatment  effect  can  not  be  claimed.  Therefore  this  text  should  be  adapted  as indicated in blue.

## Additional adaptations are considered needed

Issue subsequently resolved upon submission of updated PI by the MAH.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption:

When Fampyra tablets are taken with food, the reduction in the area under the plasma concentrationtime curve (AUC0-∞) of fampridine is approximately 2-7% (10 mg dose) and The small reduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy. However  Cmax increases by 15-23%. The consequences of these changes are not considered to be clinically meaningful;  Since there is a clear relationship between Cmax and dose related adverse reactions, it is recommended to take therefore, Fampyra can be taken with or without food (see section 4.2).

## CHMP comment 1 st  round

Insufficient  justification  is  provided  in  support  of  this  change.  The  Applicant  should  provide  further justification for this change or the current text should remain. Referred is to the comment in section 4.2.

## Applicant's response

The original text was reintroduced

## Assessment of the response

Issue resolved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5. Request for supplementary information

## 5.1. Other concerns

## Clinical aspects

1. Responders to fampridine may be more sensitive for adverse events related the pharmacodynamics of  fampridine  (e.g.  overstimulation).  These  signals  may  be  masked  in  the  overall  safety  analysis including  both  responder  and  non-responders.  A  separate  safety  analysis  for  non-responders  and responders is requested.
2. The MAH should discuss and propose a strategy to follow-up and investigate the effects in patients that  need  to  terminate  treatment  with  Fampyra.  Currently  available  data  seem  to  suggest  that  a rebound  phenomenon  may  occur  in  such  cases,  and  it  would  be  interesting  to  know  whether  the patients  return  to  a  level  of  functioning  similar  to  the  one  before  treatment,  or  if  they  experience effects of worsening.

## Clinical aspects

1. Responders to fampridine may be more sensitive for adverse events related the pharmacodynamics of  fampridine  (e.g.  overstimulation).  These  signals  may  be  masked  in  the  overall  safety  analysis including  both  responder  and  non-responders.  A  separate  safety  analysis  for  non-responders  and responders is requested.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The safety results in this response are presented for the intent-to-treat population in the  ENHANCE study excluding  patients  at  the  one  site  that  closed  due  to  GCP  issues.  Two  patients  (1  in  each  treatment group) from the original safety population have been excluded as it was not possible to determine their responder status. These two patients did not report any adverse events.

## Overview of Adverse Events

The  incidence  of  AEs  reported  in  Study  305  was  similar  between  the  3  groups  (63%  fampridine responder, 68% fampridine non-responder and 60% placebo. Most subjects had AEs that were considered mild  or  moderate  in  severity,  and  the  incidence  of  AEs  that  were  considered  severe  was  1%  in  the responder group compared to 4% in the non-responder group and 3% in placebo

The  incidence  of  AEs  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  related  to  study  treatment  was  higher  in fampridine  responders  than  the  non-responders  or  placebo-treated  subjects  (21%  vs.  15%  vs.  14%). Apart from one patient in the placebo group none of these related AEs were considered serious.

SAEs also  occurred  at  a  similar  incidence  (7%  vs.  8%  vs.  7%).  The  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  dose interruption was slightly higher for fampridine-treated subjects than for those treated with placebo (7% vs.  6%  vs.  3%).  The incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  study  treatment  discontinuation  (7% each  group) or withdrawal from the study (7% vs. 7% vs 8%) was also balanced.

## Common Adverse Events

The most common System Order Classes (SOCs) for reported AEs were infections and  infestations (27% vs.  34%  vs.  28%),  nervous  system  disorders  (25%  vs.  29%  vs.  21%),  and  musculoskeletal  and connective tissue disorders (18% vs. 17% vs. 14%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most common AEs (incidence ≥3%) among nervous system disorders were Multiple Sclerosis (MS) relapse, headache, and dizziness, with all of these occurring more commonly in the non-responder group than responder. Balance disorder occurred more commonly in the responder group.

The  most  common  AEs  among  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  were  back  pain, arthralgia,  and  pain  in  extremity,  with  all  of  these  occurring  slightly  more  frequently  in  the  responder group compared to non-responder.

There were more AEs reported in the Psychiatric Disorders SOC by responders (11% vs. 4% vs. 3%) and this was mostly due to Insomnia (7% vs. 2% vs. &lt;1%).

There were also more AEs reported by responders in the Renal and Urinary Disorders SOC (9% vs. 3% vs. 2%). No single Preferred Term (PT) or medical condition accounted for this difference.

The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  by  PT  in  both  treatment  groups  were  MS  relapse  (9%  vs.  12%  vs. 10%) and urinary tract infection (11% vs. 15% vs. 9%), consistent with the MS study population.

## Adverse Events by Severity

The  majority  of  subjects  in  all  groups  experienced  AEs  which  were  considered  to  be  mild  (30% responders vs. 30% non-responders vs. 29% placebo) or moderate (31% vs. 34% vs. 28%) in severity. Only 1% of responders, 4% of non-responders and 3% of placebo treated patients experiencing severe AEs.

## Adverse Events by Relationship to Study Treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All AEs that occurred during Study 305 were assessed by Investigators as related or not related to study treatment. Of the patients reporting AEs in all groups most experienced AEs which were considered not related to study treatment (41% vs. 53% vs. 46%)

The proportion of patients who experienced AEs considered related to study treatment was 21% in the responder group as compared with 15 % in the non-responders and 14% in the placebo.

## Serious Adverse Events

In  Study  305,  the  incidence  of  SAEs  was  comparable  between  all  3  groups  (7%  vs.  8%  vs.  7%).  MS relapse was the most frequently reported SAE in all groups with fewest in the responder group (2% vs. 6% vs. 3% in placebo).

## Adverse Events That Led to Discontinuation of Study Treatment or Study Withdrawal

The incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment or study withdrawal was comparable between the 3 groups (7% vs. 7% vs. 8%)   MS relapse and MS led to  discontinuation or withdrawal in 5 subjects in the non-responder group and 1 in the placebo and 0 in the responder.

## Adverse Events That Led to Dose Interruption

The incidence of AEs leading to dose interruption was 7% (9 subjects), 6% (10 subjects) and 3% (11 subjects) in the responder, non-responder and placebo groups, respectively

## Adverse events of possible overstimulation

The following list of  PTs was  provided  by the  Assessor  as  examples of  AEs  suggesting overstimulation which may be observed as a pharmacological effect in the fampridine responder group: Asthenia, Gait disturbance, Muscular weakness, Fatigue, Muscle spasticity, Muscle spasms and Trigeminal neuralgia. The MAH has included additional terms which have been included in the Progress Reports for the LIBERATE study  (218MS401)  (Fall,  Insomnia,  Balance  disorder,  Dizziness,  Tremor,  Sleep  disorder,  Anxiety, Irritability, Dysaesthesia, Neuralgia, Paraesthesia and Sensory disturbance).

Table 1 shows the number of patients in each group who experienced events which may suggest Central Nervous System (CNS) overstimulation (24% vs. 23% vs. 18%). There are similar proportions in each of the fampridine groups. The most commonly reported events were fall (9% vs. 7% vs. 6%) and insomnia (7%  vs.  2%  vs.  &lt;1%),  both  of  which  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  responder  group.  There  were proportionally  fewer  reports  of  dizziness,  fatigue,  muscle  spasm  and  spasticity,  anxiety,  paraesthesia, sensory disturbance and trigeminal neuralgia in the responder group compared with the non-responder. Overall  there  is  no  indication  that  the  responder  group  is  at  more  risk  of  events  related  to  potential overstimulation compared to the  non-responder or placebo groups.

## Cardiovascular Disorders

AEs  using  the  predefined classification  of  events  related  to  dysrhythmias  were  reported  for  4  subjects (3%) in the responder group, 2 subjects (1%) in the non-responders and 2 subjects (&lt;1%) treated with placebo. The events included palpitations (2 subjects, responders vs. 2 subjects, non-responders vs. 1 subject,  placebo),  tachycardia  (2  subjects,  responder),  bundle  branch  block  right  (1  subject,  nonresponder), and arrhythmia (1 subject, placebo).

## Summary / Conclusion

The incidence and severity of AEs in the two fampridine groups, responder and non-responder, are well balanced and both consistent with the established safety profile of fampridine. There is no indication that the  fampridine  responder  group  had  a  higher  incidence  of  AEs  related  to  the  pharmacodynamics  of fampridine (e.g. overstimulation).

There were occasional differences between the fampridine responder and non-responder groups in some cases of individual AEs. The incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), AEs leading to dose interruption or discontinuation and AE severity are similar and compatible with the known safety profile of fampridine and do not represent any new safety findings.

The  analysis  of  the  safety  data  for  the  patients  receiving  fampridine  by  responder  and  non-responder groups  supports  the  overall  established  safety  of  fampridine  as  observed  in  clinical  trials  and  postmarketing  use.  The  numbers  in  the  two  groups  are  relatively  small  (136  responders  and  179  non-

responders),  however,  the  safety  profile  in  the  two  groups  appears  to  be  well  balanced  with  no  new safety issues identified.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The conclusion of the Applicant that the data do not support the  concern that responders may be at an increased risk of adverse events related to the pharmacological activity of fampridine (overstimulation)  is endorsed based on the data provided. There is no large difference of these events between responders and non-responders (see table 1). Moreover, there is no consistent pattern.

## Issue resolved

2. The MAH should discuss and propose a strategy to follow-up and investigate the effects in patients that  need  to  terminate  treatment  with  Fampyra.  Currently  available  data  seem  to  suggest  that  a rebound  phenomenon  may  occur  in  such  cases,  and  it  would  be  interesting  to  know  whether  the patients  return  to  a  level  of  functioning  similar  to  the  one  before  treatment,  or  if  they  experience effects of worsening.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The  MAH  believes  that  effects  of  fampridine  treatment  discontinuation  have  been  well  characterized across  pivotal  studies  and  that  there  is  currently  no  evidence  to  support  that  patients  exposed  to fampridine experience worsening of function upon  treatment interruption. The following results corroborate this observation.

## Study MS-F203 and Study MS-F204

The effect of fampridine treatment discontinuation was evaluated during a pre-specified off treatment follow-up  visit  in  studies  MS-F203  and  MS-F204.  This  was  further  complemented  by  an  evaluation  of treatment re-initiation effects in patients who chose to participate in phase III extension studies.

In  both  MS-F203 and MS-F204, a rapid loss of treatment effect but not worsening was observed after fampridine discontinuation.  On  average,  patients  assigned  to  fampridine  in  the  blinded  phase  of  these studies  experienced  a  return  to  baseline  T25FW  walking  speed  values,  which  was  later  reversed  in patients  who  re-initiated  treatment  as  part  of  their  participation  in  the  open-label  extension  phase  of these studies (Goodman et al., 2015)

## Study 218MS305

Fampridine discontinuation effects were also assessed in Study 218MS305 during a post treatment followup visit two weeks after study treatment was completed.  The change from baseline MSWS-12 to 2 week off treatment follow-up was -2.61 (95% CI: -4.86, -0.36). These results suggest that, on a  population level, fampridine treated patients had a tendency to experience marginal improvements in their reported walking function scores after being exposed to treatment when compared to pre-treatment values.

To further clarify if this analysis on the Intent to Treat (ITT) population could have masked worsening in some  subjects,  MSWS-12  score  changes  were  also  separated  into  categories  of  change.  Patients  who reported worse scores as compared to baseline were then evaluated for the magnitude of their change and  its  comparison  to  placebo.  Overall,  the  proportion  of  fampridine  treated  patients  experiencing  a worsening in their MSWS-12 scores at off treatment follow up visit was similar to placebo (49% and 46%, respectively).  Likewise,  measures  of  statistical  dispersion  of  the  magnitude  of  increase  in  MSWS-12

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

scores was comparable between fampridine treated patients and placebo with mean, median and quartile score changes slightly favoring fampridine as compared to placebo.

For  changes  in  TUG  speed  similar  results  are  noted.    Although  placebo  treated  patients  also  had  an increase in TUG speed at follow-up visit, most fampridine treated patients showed improvements in TUG speed with mean percentage increases of 5.86% (95% CI: 2.80, 8.92) at follow up visit when compared to  baseline.  When  further  separating  patients  by  categories  of  change,  comparable  proportions  of fampridine treated patients and placebo experienced decrease in TUG speed at study completion (35% vs 39%, respectively). Furthermore, measures of statistical dispersion of the magnitude of decrease in TUG speed in this category of patients demonstrated that test performance declined in a similar  manner in fampridine and placebo patients, hence suggesting that the observed worsening of function is likely to be disease related rather than treatment related.

Finally,  we  note  that  there  were  no  serious  falls  or  other  related  SAEs  reported  in  fampridine  treated subjects during the washout period.

## Conclusion

In summary, the MAH believes that effects of treatment discontinuation were adequately studied during the fampridine clinical development program. Results obtained from three distinct phase III clinical trials using objective and patient reported outcome measures were consistent in demonstrating that patients returned to pre-treatment levels of functioning when discontinued from treatment. While some patients reported  a  worsening  compared  to  baseline,  the  proportion  was  nearly  identical  in  the  placebo  group. Consequently, the MAH believes that further investigation on the possibility for a rebound phenomenon is not warranted at this time.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The conclusion of the Applicant that the data do not support the possibility for a rebound phenomenon is not  completely  agreed.  The  long  term  extension  study  (MS-F203  &amp;  MS-F204)  did  not  specific  address rebound. The MSWQ12 may not be sensitive to pick up rebound although it may be argued that if the MSWQ12 does not this up it of limited clinical relevance.

Nevertheless the data presented appear compatible with this view that rebound is not an issue although based on circumstantial evidence.

| Seizure          | Text in SmPC Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment with Fampyra is restricted to prescription and supervision by physicians experienced in the management of MS. The recommended dose is one 10 mg tablet, twice daily, taken 12 hours apart.(one 1 tablet in the morning and one1 tablet in the evening). Fampyra should not be administered more frequently or at higher doses than recommended(see section 4.4). The tablets shouldcan be taken with orwithout food (see section 5.2) Initial prescription should be limited to 2 to 4 weeks of therapy as clinical benefits should generally be identified within 2-to 4weeks after starting Fampyra A timed an assessment ofwalking testability, e.g. the Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW),or MSWS 12, is recommended to evaluate improvement after two weekswithin 2 to 4 weeks. If no improvement is observed, Fampyra should be discontinued Fampyra should be discontinued if benefit is not reported by patients. If decline in walking ability is observed physicians should consider an interruption to treatment in order to reassess the benefits of Fampyra (see above). The re-evaluation should include withdrawal of Fampyra and performing the an assessment pofwalking testability. Fampyra should be discontinued if patients no longer receive walking benefit. The usual dosing regime regimenshould always be followed. A double dose should not be taken if a dose is missed.

| Interaction with | during treatment is recommended in all patients (particularly the elderlyin older people in whom renal function might be reduced). Creatinine clearance can be estimated using the Cockroft-Gault formula. Fampyra should not be administered to patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <80 mlmL/min) (see section 4.3). Caution is required when Fampyra is prescribed concurrently with medicinal products that are substrates of OCT2 for example, carvedilol, propanolol, and metformin. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Fampridine is eliminated mainly via the kidneys with active renal secretion accounting for about 60% (see section 5.2). OCT2 is the transporter responsible for the active secretion of fampridine. Thus, the concomitant use of fampridine with medicinal products that are inhibitors of OCT2 for example, cimetidine are contraindicated (see section 4.3) and concomitant use of fampridine with medicinal products that are substrates of OCT2 for example, carvedilol, propanolol, and metformin is cautioned (see section 4.4.) Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Fampridine is eliminated primarily by the kidneys as unchanged medicinal product and therefore renal function should be checked in patients where renal function might be compromised. Elimination The major route of elimination for fampridine is renal excretion, with approximately 90% of the dose recovered in urine as parent medicinal product within 24 hours. Renal clearance (CLR 370 ml mL/min) is substantially greater than glomerular filtration rate due to combined glomerular filtration and active excretion by the renal OCT2 transporter. Faecal excretion accounts for less than 1% of the administered dose. Fampyra is characterized by linear (dose-proportional) pharmacokineticsPKs with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 6 hours. The maximum plasma concentration ( The C max ) and, to a smaller extent, area under the plasma concentration- time curve (AUC) increase proportionately with dose. There is no evidence of clinically relevant accumulation of fampridine taken at the recommended dose in patients with full renal function. In patients with renal impairment accumulation occurs relative to the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment: Fampridine is eliminated primarily by the kidneys as unchanged medicinal product and therefore renal function should be checked in patients where renal function might be compromised. Patients with mild renal impairment can be expected to have approximately 1.7 to 1.9 times the fampridine concentrations achieved by patients with normal renal function. Fampyra must not be administered to patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment (see section 4.3). None | None                                    |
