## Clinical studies

## Study V59\\_39

## Description

This  phase  3  study  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  immunogenicity  and  the  safety  of  MenACWY  in healthy subjects from 11 to 55 years of age in Korea.

## Methods

## Objectives

## Primary:

To assess the immunogenicity of a single injection of MenACWY as measured by the percentage of subjects with hSBA seroresponse, directed against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y.

## Secondary:

To assess the immunogenicity of MenACWY as measured by hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs) and by the percentage of subjects with hSBA .1:8 directed against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y.

## Safety objectives:

To  assess  the  safety  profile  following  MenACWY  and  saline  placebo  in  terms  of  percentages  and numbers of subjects with:

- Local and systemic reactions reported from day 1 (day of vaccination) through day 7 postvaccination.
- All other adverse events (AEs) reported from day 1 through day 7 postvaccination.
- Serious AEs (SAEs) and medically attended AEs from day 1 through day 29.

## Study design

This study was designed as a phase 3, observer-blind, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled study in healthy subjects aged 11 to 55 years in Korea.

## Study population /Sample size

The study enrolled (non-pregnant) healthy subjects aged 11 to 55 years who had not:

- -had a previous or suspected disease caused by N. meningitidis,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -had household contact with and/or intimate exposure to an individual with culture-proven N. meningitidis infection within 60 days prior to enrolment, or
- -had previously been immunized with a meningococcal vaccine

A total of approximately 450 healthy subjects (including a drop-out rate of 20%) were enrolled in this study.

## Treatments

Subjects between the ages of 11 and 55 years old were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either MenACWY or saline placebo.

Subjects who have been randomized to Group II, the control group, will be given the option to be vaccinated with MenACWY after successful registration of the vaccine.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The  measure  of  immunogenicity  used  in  this  study  is  a  Serum  Bactericidal  Assay  using  human complement (hSBA). hSBA for MenA, MenC, MenW135, and MenY was performed at Novartis Vaccines, Klinische Serologie, Marburg (Germany). All subjects had a blood draw before the vaccination (day 1) and 28 days following the vaccination (day 29).

The immunogenicity endpoints are (all at day 29):

Primary: % subjects with hSBA seroresponse defined as:

- for subjects with a pre-vaccination hSBA titer &lt; 1:4, a postvaccination hSBA titer ≥1:8
- for subjects with a pre-vaccination hSBA titer ≥1:4, an increase in hSBA titer of at least four times the pre-vaccination titer.

Secondary:  hSBA GMTs and  % subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8

The  immune  response  was  considered  sufficient  (i.e.,  the  primary  objective  is  met)  if  for  all  four serogroups, the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the percentage of subjects with hSBA seroresponse is≥50%.

## CHMP's comments

Note that the acceptance criteria for the immune response (i.e. hSBA seroresponse ≥50%) would not be acceptable in the European context - response would be expected to be ~70%.

## Statistical Methods

Definition of analysis populations:

- (a) All Enrolled Population included▫ all subjects who were randomized

(b)  Full  Analysis  Set/Modified  Intention-to-treat  (MITT)  population,  Immunogenicity  included▫  all subjects in the enrolled population who actually received a study vaccination, and - provided at least one evaluable serum sample both before and after baseline and whose assay result is available for at least one serogroup.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(c)  Per  Protocol  Set/Per protocol  (PP)  population,  Immunogenicity included all subjects in the MITT immunogenicity  population  who  had  correctly  received  the  vaccine,  and  provided  evaluable  serum samples  at  the  relevant  time  points,  and    had  no  major  protocol  violation  as  defined  prior  to unblinding. In case of randomization errors, subjects were excluded from the PP analysis and analyzed as randomized in the MITT population

(d) Exposed Population included all enrolled subjects who actually received a study vaccination

(e) Safety population included all subjects in the Exposed population who provided post-baseline safety data. In case of randomization errors, subjects were analyzed as treated in the safety analysis.

## Statistical Hypothesis

The antibody response of MenACWY was planned to be considered sufficient if for all four serogroups the  lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  95%  CI  (i.e.,  the  lower  limit  of  the  onesided  97.5%  CI)  for  the percentage of subjects with seroresponse, was at least 50%.

## Analysis

Primary analysis: The primary analysis population for immunogenicity is the Per Protocol Immunogenicity Population. If the difference between the PP and MITT population was at least 10% then the immunogenicity analyses on the primary endpoints was also assessed on the MITT population

Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) for age, height and weight at enrollment were calculated overall and by vaccine group. Distributions of subjects by sex and age  were  summarized  overall  and  by  vaccine  group.  The  percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA seroresponse  and  associated  two-sided  95%  Clopper-Pearson  CIs  were  computed  for  each  vaccine group and N. meningitidis serogroup, at each time point for which a blood sample was available. The hSBA titers at each visit were logarithmically transformed (base10) and summarized by serogroup and vaccine  group.  GMTs  and  associated  two  sided  95%  CIs  were  calculated  at  each  time  point  by exponentiating the corresponding log-transformed means (and mean differences from baseline in logtransformed titers) and 95% CIs for the log-transformed means obtained from a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with a factor for vaccine group and study center. Titers below the limit of detection were set to half that limit for the purposes of analysis. The percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 to N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W135 and Y was computed for each vaccine group, serogroup and time point including two-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson CIs.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

All 297 subjects enrolled in the MenACWY group and 153 subjects in the placebo group completed the study.  Major  protocol  deviations  were  reported  for  1  subject  (&lt;1%)  in  the  MenACWY  group  and  1 subject (&lt;1%) in the placebo group, while minor protocol deviations were reported for 5 subjects (2%) in  the  MenACWY group and 1 subject (&lt;1%) in the placebo group. Protocol deviations were mostly 'Developed Withdrawal Criteria but not Withdrawn' (2 in MenACWY group, 1 in control group) and no hSBA results at visit 2 (1 in MenACWY group).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Baseline data

The  demographic  and  other  baseline  characteristics  were  balanced  across  the  different  vaccination groups.  Age,  sex  ratios,  height  and  weight  were  similar  across  the  vaccination  groups  and  all  the enrolled subjects met the study entry criteria (Table).

## Efficacy results

The  overall  seroresponse  rates  at  day  29  were  76%,  86%,  28%,  and  69%  for  the  A,  C,  W  and  Y serogroups, respectively.  Lower  limits  of  the  two-sided  95%  Clopper-Pearson  CI  for  these  observed seroresponse rates were 71%, 82%, 23%, and 63% for the A, C, W and Y serogroups, respectively. The majority of subjects entered the study with hSBA ≥ 1:4 against W serogroup in both MenACWY and placebo groups (261 out of 293 subjects [89%] in the MenACWY group and 131 out of 151 subjects [87%] in the placebo group). Only 21% of the 261 MenACWY subjects who had baseline hSBA ≥ 1:4 against the W serogroup were seroresponders.

Two-sided 95%Clopper-Pearson confidence interval.

The percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 at baseline were high for the  C, W, and Y serogroups (49% and 39% for C, 89% and 87% for W and 54% and 53% for Y serogroups in MenACWY and placebo arms, respectively). However, the percentage of subjects with pre-existing titers was low for the A serogroup (13% in the MenACWY group and 15% in the placebo group).

## CHMP's comments

These primary outcome of seroresponse at D29 is largely in line with the results seen from pivotal study  V59P13  submitted  in  support  of  the  licensing  of  Menveo  in  the  EU.  A  high  level  of  baseline immunity to MenW has also been seen in other studies, albeit not this high. The seroresponse in these subjects was however lower than would be expected based upon earlier studies (21% in this study compared to  47%  in  V59P13  for  example).  Importantly,  there  is  a  substantial  increase  in  GMTs  in subjects  with  baseline  immunity  against  MenW  in  the  present  study  (GMR  2.09  vs  0.93  in  placebo group). Moreover, the % of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 is acceptable.

## Safety results

In total 450 persons were enrolled, of which 297 exposed to MenACWY and 153 exposed to placebo. All subjects were included in the safety population. Of these, 40% in the MenACWY group compared to 34% in the placebo group had at least one reported local or systemic reaction during the 7 days after vaccination.  The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  local  reactions  was  comparatively  higher  in  the MenACWY group (28%) than the placebo group (9%), whereas the percentage of subjects reporting systemic  reactions  was  similar  in  both  groups  (28%).  Unsolicited  AEs  were  reported  by  12%  of subjects receiving MenACWY vs 7% of those receiving placebo (up to D29). AEs considered related to study vaccine were reported for 4% (11 subjects) of the MenACWY group vs 1% (2 subjects) of the placebo group.

## Solicited local and systemic reactogenicity.

The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  solicited  local  reactions  was  comparatively  higher  in  the MenACWY group than the placebo group. The most commonly reported local reaction was pain (23% in the MenACWY group and 8% in the placebo group) and none of them were severe in intensity. Other local reactions were erythema and induration.

## CHMP's comments

Safety findings are in line with the known safety profile of Menveo.

## V59\\_40

## Description

A  Phase  4,  Placebo-Controlled,  Randomized  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Immunogenicity  and  Safety  of  a Combined  Tetanus,  Reduced  Diphtheria  Toxoid,  Acellular  Pertussis  Vaccine  (Tdap,  Boostrix®)  and Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus [Types 6, 11, 16, 18] Recombinant Vaccine (Gardasil®) in Healthy Adolescents when Administered with MenACWY Conjugate Vaccine

## CHMP's comments

The  possible  interaction  between  Gardasil  and  Menveo  and  Tdap/Boostrix  and  Menveo  has  been studied in V59P18. V59P18 examined the effect of concomitant administration of MenACWY with Tdap and HPV on immunogenicity (to MenACWY, Tdap and HPV vaccine) and safety. This study provided no evidence to suggest that concomitant administration of MenACWY with Tdap &amp; HPV vaccines has an effect  on  the  immune response to MenACWY. There was some evidence to suggest that vaccination with Tdap one month prior to vaccination with MenACWY might interfere with the immune response to MenACWY, as non-inferiority could not be demonstrated for MenW. Secondly, there was some evidence to suggest a negative effect of concomitant vaccination with MenACWY and HPV on the response to pertussis antigens FHA and PRN, however the clinical relevance is unknown.

## Methods

## Objective(s)

Immunogenicity Objectives:

Coprimary:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. To demonstrate that the immune response of Tdap given concomitantly with MenACWY and HPV is noninferior to the response of Tdap when given with placebo and HPV when measured at 1 month after 1 dose of Tdap.

2. To demonstrate that the immune response of HPV vaccine given concomitantly with MenACWY and Tdap is noninferior to the response when HPV is given with placebo and Tdap when measured at 1 month after the third dose of HPV vaccination.

## Secondary:

To assess the immune response of MenACWY when administered with Tdap and HPV at 1 month after 1 dose of MenACWY vaccination.

## Safety Objectives

To describe the safety profile of Men+Tdap+HPV vs. Placebo+Tdap+HPV.

The  current  clinical  study  report  (CSR)  presents  only  data  for  the  first  primary  objective  and  the secondary immunogenicity and safety objectives. The immunogenicity analysis for the second primary objective  (assessment  of  immune  response  against  HPV  antigens)  will  be  performed  as  soon  as serological  results  are  available.  The  results  will  be  presented  in  an  addendum  to  the  clinical  study report.

## Study design

This  study  was  designed  as  a  phase  4,  placebo-controlled,  randomized  study  to  evaluate  the immunogenicity  and  safety  of  a  combined  tetanus,  reduced  diphtheria  toxoid,  acellular  pertussis vaccine and quadrivalent HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recombinant vaccine in healthy adolescents when administered with MenACWY.

## Study population /Sample size

The  study  included  healthy  male/  (non-pregnant)  female  subjects  with  no  history  of  meningococcal infection  and/or  vaccination  or  HPV  vaccination,  and  with  an  up-to-date  vaccination  record  for  DTP. Approximately 800 subjects, 400 in group 1 and 400 in group 2 were to be enrolled in this study. The expected dropout rate was 10%.

## Treatments

Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio within each study center. Group 1 received Tdap, HPV and MenACWY concomitantly for the first vaccination. Group 2 received Tdap, HPV and placebo concomitantly for the first vaccination.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary outcomes:

- Seroprotection rates for diphtheria and tetanus at 1 month after Tdap vaccination:
- Percentage of subjects with diphtheria antitoxin ≥ 1.0 IU/mL; and
- Percentage of subjects with tetanus antitoxin ≥ 1.0 IU/mL.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- GMCs for anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN at 1 month after Tdap vaccination

▫  Seroconversion  rates  for  HPV  types  6,  11,  16  and  18  at  1  month  after  3  HPV  vaccinations. Seroconversion  was  defined  as  a  negative  baseline  sample  for  anti-HPV  antibodies  and  anti-HPV antibody level greater than or equal to the HPV type-specific cutoff at 1 month after the third dose of HPV vaccine. The HPV type-specific seroconversion cutoffs were:

- Percentage of subjects with HPV 6 ≥ 20 mMU/mL;
- Percentage of subjects with HPV 11 ≥ 16 mMU/mL;
- Percentage of subjects with HPV 16 ≥ 20 mMU/mL; and
- Percentage of subjects with HPV 18 ≥ 24 mMU/mL.

## General Endpoints and Statistics:

▫  GMT  or  GMC  with  associated  2-sided  95%  CIs  are  displayed  by  visit  and  vaccine  group.  When baseline values were available, geometric mean ratios (GMRs) to baseline were also presented.

▫ Percentage of subjects meeting response criteria. For the routine vaccine antigens, the cut-off levels indicated  seroprotection/seroconversion  rates.  The  2-sided  95%  CIs  for  all  response  rates  were displayed for all available immunogenicity data by visit and vaccine group.

▫  Anti-HPV  seroconversion  was  defined  as  a  negative  baseline  sample  for  anti-HPV  and  an  anti-HPV greater than or equal to the HPV type-specific cutoff at 1 month after the third dose of the vaccine.

▫  All  primary  and  secondary  objectives  are  embedded  within  the  display  of  GMT/GMC/percentage response according to the respective visit and vaccine group of interest.

## Statistical Methods

Definition of populations analyzed:

All Enrolled Population: The enrolled population contained all subjects enrolled and randomized in the study.

Exposed Population : All subjects in the enrolled population who received a study vaccination.

MITT Population: The MITT population included all subjects in the enrolled population who received all the relevant doses of vaccine, and  provided at least 1 evaluable serum sample after baseline.

Per  Protocol  (PP)  Population: The  PP  population  included  all  subjects  in  the  MITT  immunogenicity population who correctly received all the relevant doses of vaccine, provided evaluable serum samples at the relevant time points; and ▫ had no major protocol deviation as defined prior to study unblinding.

The PP populations were:

PP - Tdap Serology results at visit 2 within required windows for at least 1 Tdap antigen.

PP - HPV Serology results for at least 1 HPV type at both visit 1 and visit 5 within required window

PP - MenACWY Serology results for at least 1 serogroup at both visit 1 and visit 2 within the required window

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subjects were included in the PP population if they had no major deviations. A major deviation was defined as a protocol deviation that was considered to have a significant impact on the immunogenicity result of the subject.

Analysis for the primary immunogenicity objectives was based on the PP population as well as the MITT population.  Analyses  for  secondary  immunogenicity  objectives  and  other  immunogenicity  endpoints were carried out in the PP population only.

## Safety Population

All subjects who had received at least 1 study vaccine and had postbaseline safety data were included in  the  safety  analysis.  If  an  error  in  administration  occurred  where  the  actual  vaccination  that  the subject  received  was  different  than  the  one  to  which  they  were  randomly  assigned  (unless  they received  all  doses  in  accordance  with  the  incorrect  schedule),  the  subject  was  included  in  the vaccination  group  for  the  vaccine  they  were  randomized  to  receive.  If  the  full  series  was  provided incorrectly, the subject was analyzed as treated. Safety analyses were based on the safety population.

Subjects who only provided safety data at 30 minutes postvaccination were represented in summaries of safety at 30 minutes postvaccination and were excluded from all other summaries of safety.

## Analysis of Immunogenicity criteria

The success criterion for this study was a composite based upon 2 coprimary objectives that involve 9 noninferiority hypotheses. The first coprimary objective was to demonstrate that the immune response of Tdap given concomitantly with MenACWY and HPV was noninferior to the response of Tdap when given with placebo and HPV when measured at 1 month after 1 dose of Tdap. The second coprimary objective  was  to  demonstrate  that  the  immune  response  of  HPV  vaccine  given  concomitantly  with MenACWY and Tdap was noninferior to the response when HPV was given with placebo and Tdap when measured at 1 month after the third dose of HPV vaccination.

First Coprimary Objective: To demonstrate that the immune response of Tdap given concomitantly with MenACWY and HPV is noninferior to the response of Tdap when given  with  placebo  and  HPV  when measured at 1 month after 1 dose of Tdap.

The group 1 immune response to Tdap was considered noninferior to the group 2 immune response to Tdap at 1 month after Tdap administration if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI on the difference between the group 1 and group 2 diphtheria seroprotection rate and on the difference between the group 1 and group 2 tetanus seroprotection rate were each greater than -10%, and if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI on the ratio of group 1 to group 2 GMCs for anti-PT, anti-FHA, and anti-PRN were each greater than 0.5.

The 2-sided 95% CIs for group 1 minus group 2 differences in diphtheria and tetanus response rates were constructed using the method of Miettinen and Nurminen. The group 1 versus group 2 GMC ratios for  anti-PT,  anti-FHA  and  anti-PRN  and  their  associated  2-sided  95%  CIs  were  computed  by exponentiating (base10) the corresponding vaccine group difference in least square means of the logtransformed  concentrations  and  the  associated  95%  CI  for  the  difference  obtained  from  an  ANOVA model having factors for vaccine group and center. Concentrations below the limit of detection were set to half the limit for the purpose of analysis.

Second  Coprimary  Objective:  To  demonstrate  that  the  immune  response  of  HPV  vaccine  given concomitantly  with  MenACWY  and  Tdap  is  noninferior  to  the  response  when  HPV  was  given  with placebo and Tdap when measured at 1 month after the third dose of HPV.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The group 1 immune response to HPV will be considered noninferior to the group 2 immune response to HPV if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI on the differences between the group 1 and group 2 HPV type 6, 11, 16, and 18 seroconversion rates are each greater than -5%. The 2-sided 95% CIs for the group 1 minus group 2 differences in HPV 6, HPV 11, HPV 16, and HPV 18 seroconversion rates will be constructed using the method of Miettinen and Nurminen. Titers below the limit of detection will be set to half the limit for the purpose of analysis.

Secondary Response Variables: To assess the immune response of MenACWY when administered with Tdap and HPV at 1 month after 1 dose of MenACWY vaccination. For a subject with baseline hSBA &lt;1:4, seroresponse was defined as a postvaccination hSBA ≥ 1:8; for a subject with baseline hSBA ≥ 1:4,  seroresponse  was  defined  as  a  postvaccination  hSBA  of  at  least  4  times  the  baseline.  The assessment of this objective was based upon descriptive statistics and the construction of 2-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson  CIs  on  the  seroresponse  rates  for  each  serogroup  at  1  month  after  MenACWY vaccination in group 1.

## Exploratory/Other Analyses

Other measures of immunogenicity included i) GMCs for diphtheria antitoxin and tetanus antitoxin at 1 month after Tdap vaccination, ii) seroresponse rates for anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN at 1 month after  Tdap  vaccination,  iii)  GMTs  for  human  HPV  types  6,  11,  16  and  18  at  1  month  after  3  HPV vaccinations, iv) percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 for meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y, and  v)  hSBA  GMTs  for  meningococcal  serogroups  A,  C,  W  and  Y.  These  additional  endpoints  were assessed using the same methods as for the analogous primary and secondary endpoints. However, there were no criteria for assessing vaccine group differences where group comparisons were made. For analyses showing GMCs/GMTs, GMRs to baseline were presented.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A  total  of  801  subjects  who  signed  informed  consent  forms  were  enrolled  in  the  study  and  were randomized;  402  subjects  were  included  in  the  Men+Tdap+HPV  group  and  399  subjects  in  the Placebo+Tdap+HPV group. In the enrolled population, 741 (93%) subjects completed the study and 60 (7%)  subjects  were  prematurely  withdrawn.  The  premature  withdrawals  were  mostly  due  to withdrawal of consent (3%) and lost to follow up (3%). Less than 1% subjects were withdrawn due to protocol deviations (7 subjects), AEs (2 subjects), and administrative reasons (1 subject).

Out of a total of 801 enrolled subjects, 131 (16%) subjects (18% in the MenACWY+Tdap+HPV group and 15% in the Placebo+Tdap+HPV group) had major protocol deviations. The most common major deviations  were  due  to  noncompliance  with  study  vaccination  schedule  (10%  subjects  in  the MenACWY+Tdap+HPV group and 8% subjects in the Placebo+Tdap+HPV group), followed by receipt of concomitant vaccine(s) forbidden in the protocol (2% in the MenACWY+Tdap+HPV group and 3% in the Placebo+Tdap+HPV group) and noncompliance with blood draw schedules (2% in the MenACWY+Tdap+HPV and Placebo+Tdap+HPV groups).

Minor protocol deviations were reported for 297 (37%) subjects. These were most commonly due to procedural  deviations  (27%),  unavailability  of  diary  card  or  worksheet  and/or  solicited  safety  data (13%), and subject randomization out of sequence (2%).

## Efficacy results

First Coprimary endpoint: The noninferiority criterion for diphtheria antigen was met, as the difference in  seroprotection rates observed between the study groups was 13%, with the lower limit of the 2sided 95% CI for the difference being 9%. The difference in seroprotection rates was 0%, with the lower  limit  of  the  2-sided  95%  CI  for  the  difference  being  -2%  (Table  11.4.1-1),  satisfying  the noninferiority  criterion  for  tetanus  antigen.  The  ratios  of  the  GMCs  of  antibodies  against  pertussis antigens for the Men+Tdap+HPV group to the Placebo+Tdap+HPV group were 1.01 for anti-PT, 0.84 for anti-FHA, and 0.82 for anti-PRN with the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the vaccine group ratio  being  0.89,  0.76,  and,  0.72  respectively  (each  greater  than  0.5).  Therefore  the  noninferiority criteria for all pertussis antigens were met. In summary, the primary immunogenicity analysis showed that  the  immune  responses  to  Tdap  vaccine  given  concomitantly  with  MenACWY  and  HPV  were

Souce: Table 14.2.1.9. Abbreviations: HPV, human papilloma vinus; MenACWY, meningococeal ACWY Vaccine; hSBA, human serum bacterieidal assay; PP, per protocol; Tdap, tetanus diphtheria acellular pertussis. Note: For a subject with baseline hSBA &lt;l:4, seroresponse is defined as a postvaccination hSBA ≥1:8; for a subject with baseline hSBA ≥l:4, seroresponse is defined as a postvaccination hSBA of at least 4 times the baseline.

Secondary  Objectives:  In  the  Men+Tdap+HPV  group,  at  1  month  postvaccination,  the  overall seroresponse  rate  to  a  single  dose  of  MenACWY  was  75%,  69%,  49%,  and  69%  respectively  for serogroups A, C, W, and Y. Among the subjects with baseline hSBA &lt;1:4, the seroresponse rate at 1 month postvaccination was 76%, 78%, 89%, and 81% respectively for serogroups A, C,W and Y. For subjects with baseline hSBA ≥1:4, the seroresponse rate was 65%, 58%, 28% and 50% respectively for serogroups A, C, W, and Y. Approximately 1% to 5% of subjects in the Placebo+Tdap+HPV group showed seroresponse against any MenACWY serogroup.

At  1  month  postvaccination,  the  GMTs  in  the  Men+Tdap+HPV  group  versus  the  Placebo+Tdap+HPV group  were  35  vs.  2.13  against  serogroup  A,  59  vs.  3.92  against  serogroup  C,  61  vs.  12  against

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

serogroup W and 48 vs. 3.54 against serogroup Y, respectively. In the Men+Tdap+HPV group, at 1 month postvaccination, the GMTs increased 16-fold (GMR) over the baseline against serogroup A, 13fold  against  serogroup  C,  5-fold  against  serogroup  W  and  12-fold  against  serogroup  Y.  The  relative increase in GMTs for MenW was lower than the other serogroups, reflecting the higher baseline hSBA.

## Assessor's comments

Results are in line with the known immunogenicity of MenACWY. Note that earlier studies (V59P18) provided some indication that there might be immune interference between Tdap and MenACWY: the effect of concomitant administration on the response to the MenW component can not be evaluated in the current study.

V59P18  also  provided  some  evidence  to  suggest  a  negative  effect  of  concomitant  vaccination  with MenACWY and HPV on the response to pertussis antigens FHA and PRN, in this study too the response to  FHA  and  PRN  is  significantly  lower  (albeit  non-inferiority  was  demonstrated)  when  Tdap  is  given concomitantly with MenACWY, confirming earlier findings.

## Safety results

Among  801  subjects  in  the  enrolled  population,  793  (99%)  subjects  were  exposed  to  the  study vaccines, all of whom provided postvaccination safety data and were included in the safety set.

## Solicited local and systemic reactogenicity.

The  percentage  of  subjects  with  any  solicited  AE  reported  from  day  1  (6  hours)  through  day  7 postvaccination was 72% in the Men+Tdap+HPV group and 64% in the Placebo+Tdap+HPV group

The rates of both local and systemic solicited AEs were higher in the Men+Tdap+HPV group than in the Placebo+Tdap+HPV group (local AEs: 54% vs. 43%; systemic AEs: 53% vs. 46%) after the first study vaccination. The most commonly reported local solicited AE was pain at the injection site (41% vs. 35% in Men+Tdap+HPV vs. Placebo+Tdap+HPV, respectively; p=0.095), followed by erythema (17% vs.  7%;  p&lt;0.001)  and  induration  (16%  vs.  10%;p=0.011).  The  most  commonly  reported  systemic solicited  AE  from  6  hours  through  day  7  was  myalgia  (30%  vs.  26%  in  Men+Tdap+HPV  vs. Placebo+Tdap+HPV, respectively) followed  by  headache  (29%  vs.  25%),  chills  (15%  vs.  13%)  and malaise (15% vs. 11%).

## Other AEs.

The proportion of subjects with each unsolicited AE was similar across the study groups; 51% in the Men+Tdap+HPV group and  50%  in  Placebo+Tdap+HPV  group.  The  possibly  related  unsolicited  AEs were reported by 4% of subjects in both study groups.

The most commonly reported unsolicited treatment emergent AEs were injection site pain (7% vs. 6% in Men+Tdap+HPV vs. Placebo+Tdap+HPV) and pharyngitis (6% vs. 5%).

There was no death reported in this study. A total of 7 subjects (4 subjects in the Men+Tdap+HPV group and 3 subjects in the Placebo+Tdap+HPV group) reported 9 SAEs during the entire study period. Haematuria, abdominal adhesions, small intestinal obstruction, aggression, hypothyroidism, and type 1 diabetes mellitus were SAEs reported in subjects in the Men+Tdap+HPV group. Peritonsillar abscess, accidental overdose and affective disorder were reported in subjects in the Placebo+Tdap+HPV group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All  subjects  recovered  from  the  SAEs  except  for  one  subject  (119/017)  with  persistent  affective disorder. None of the SAEs were considered to be related to study vaccine.

Pyrexia  and  headache  in  subject  108/035  and  vasovagal  syncope  in  subject  114/047  led  to  the premature withdrawal in the Men+Tdap+HPV group. Subject 114/047 was not vaccinated during the study.  Toothache,  influenza  and  laceration  led  to  delay  in  study  vaccination  in  2  subjects  from  the Men+Tdap+HPV group and 1 subject from the Placebo+Tdap+HPV group.

## Assessor's comments :

Safety findings are in line with the known safety profile of Menveo.

Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives

- To assess the immunogenicity of a single injection of MenACWY-CRM vaccine as measured by the percentage  of subjects with hSBA  seroresponsea,  directed against N  meningitidis serogroups A, C, W135 and Y by age group (2-10b, 11-18c years).
- To assess the immunogenicity of a single injection of MenACWY-CRM as measured by hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs and GMRd) and by the percentage of subjects with hSBA titer ≥ 1:8, directed against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W135 and Y, overall and by age group.

## Safety objectives

To assess the safety profile following MenACWY-CRM vaccination in terms of percentages and numbers of subjects with:

- Local  and  systemic  reactionse  reported  from  day  1  (day  of  vaccination)  through  day  7 postvaccination.
- All other adverse eventse (AEs) reported from day 1 through day 7 postvaccination
- Serious AEs (SAEs), medically attended AEs and AEs resulting in premature withdrawal from day 1 through day 29.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study design

This was a phase 3, multicenter, single armed open-label study to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of MenACWY-CRM in healthy subjects ≥ 2 to ≤ 18 years of age in Taiwan.

## CHMP's comments:

Note that the study design was a recommendation of the Taiwanese authorities.

## Study population /Sample size

Inclusion criteria: Subjects eligible to be enrolled in this study were those who were ≥2 to ≤18 years of age, those whose parent/legal representative provided written informed consent (≥2 to ≤18 years of age) and who provided written assent (≥7 to ≤18 years of age), were available for both study visits, and were in good health based on the clinical judgment of the investigator. Exclusion criteria: Serious, acute, or chronic illnesses were reasons for exclusion.

A total of 340 subjects (170 subjects in each age group) were planned to be enrolled in the study. A total of 341 subjects were actually enrolled; 173 subjects in the age group ≥ 2 to ≤ 10 years and 168 subjects in the age group ≥ 11 to ≤ 18 years. A total of 340 (173 subjects in the age group ≥ 2 to ≤ 10 years and 167 subjects in the age group ≥ 11 to ≤ 18 years) subjects completed the study and were analyzed for safety, 336 (170 subjects in the age group ≥ 2 to ≤ 10 years and 166 subjects in the age group ≥ 11  to ≤ 18  years)  subjects  were  included  in  the  modified-intent-to-treat  (MITT)  and  per protocol (PP) immunogenicity analyses

## Treatments

Investigational  (Test)  vaccine,  Novartis  MenACWY  (vial/vial)  [Lot  no.  M11006  (expiry  date  August 2012)] was obtained by extemporaneous mixing of the lyophilized MenA component with the liquid MenCWY component just before injection. One 0.5 mL dose of MenACWY-CRM was administered by intramuscular (IM) injection in the deltoid area of nondominant arm.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Immunogenicity

Primary Endpoint

- Percentage of subjects with hSBA seroresponse to N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W135 and Y at day 29 in the overall subjects ( ≥ 2 to ≤ 18 years of age).

Seroresponse is defined as:

- for subjects with a prevaccination hSBA titer &lt; 1:4, a postvaccination hSBA titer ≥ 1:8.
- for subjects with a prevaccination hSBA titer ≥ 1:4, an increase in hSBA titer of at least four times the prevaccination titer.

## Secondary Endpoints

- Percentage of subjects with hSBA seroresponse to N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W135 and Y at day 29 by age group ( ≥ 2 to ≤ 10 years and ≥ 11 to ≤ 18 years).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- hSBA GMTs to N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W135 and Y at day 1 and day 29, overall and by age group.
- hSBA geometric mean ratio (GMR) to N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W135 and Y, overall and by age group.
- Percentage of subjects with hSBA titer ≥ 1:8 to N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W135 and Y at day 1 and day 29, overall and by age group.

## Safety Endpoints

Numbers and percentages of subjects with reported solicited local and systemic AEs and unsolicited AEs.

## Statistical Methods

For this study there was no hypothesis to be statistically tested. Endpoints were reported descriptively, overall and by age group.

Definition of data sets analyzed:

a. Enrolled set: all subjects who signed an informed consent, underwent screening procedure(s), and were assigned a subject number.

b. Exposed set: all enrolled subjects who actually received the study vaccination.

c. Safety set: all subjects in the exposed set who provided any postbaseline safety data.

d. Modified intent-to-treat (MITT) set: This set was defined by visit (visit 1, visit 2, both visits) and by serogroup. All subjects in the exposed set who provided evaluable serum samples whose assay results were  available  for  at  least  one  serogroup  on  day  1  and/or  day  29.  The  primary  and  secondary objectives were based on MITT Population e. Per protocol (PP) set: all subjects in MITT who had no major protocol violations.

The  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  with  hSBA  seroresponse  and  associated  two-sided  95% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for each N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W135 and Y at day 29, for all subjects overall.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

Date of first enrollment: 15-08-2011; Date of last visit: 21-01-12

There were 341 subjects enrolled into the study and 340 subjects completed the study. One subject in the age group ≥ 11  to ≤ 18  years  was  prematurely withdrawn  from the study due to withdrawal of consent. The primary analysis set was MITT that included nearly all subjects (336; 99%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Baseline data

The  mean  age  of  age  group ≥ 2  to ≤ 10  years  and ≥ 11  to ≤ 18  years  was  6.3  and  14.0  years, respectively and nearly a similar number of male and female subjects participated in both age groups.

## Efficacy results

## Primary objective

The overall seroresponse rates at day 29 after MenACWY-CRM vaccination were 83%, 93%, 50%, and 65% respectively for the serogroups A, C, W135, and Y. Highest seroresponse was observed against the serogroup C (93%) and the lowest against the serogroup W135 (50%). The majority of subjects entered the study with hSBA titer ≥ 1:4 against the serogroup W135 (201 out of 334 subjects; 60%).

In the subjects with the negative prevaccination titer (baseline titer &lt; 1:4), hSBA seroresponse was 83%, 96%, 89%, and 77% respectively for the serogroups A, C, W135, and Y after MenACWY-CRM vaccination.

The percentage of subjects with prevaccination hSBA titer ≥ 1:8 were low for the serogroups A, C, Y (3%,  17%  and  24%,  respectively)  and  high  for  the  serogroups  W135  (58%).  At  day  29  after MenACWY-CRM vaccination, the percentages of subjects with hSBA titer ≥ 1:8 were 83%, 96%, 96%, and 82% respectively for the serogroups A, C, W135, and Y.

## CHMP's comments

Results are in line with other immunogenicity studies in the same age groups. The response is slightly higher in older children compared to children aged 2-10 yrs. Here too the limited seroresponse seen in subjects  with  pre-existing  antibody  titers  against  MenW  but  also  MenY  is  evident  -  there  is  a substantial increase in GMT. A relatively high proportion of subjects had pre-existing antibodies against MenW, this proportion increased with age.

## Safety results

Of the 341 subjects enrolled in this study, 340 were administered study vaccine. Subject 03/015 was terminated from the study due to withdrawal of consent at visit 1 and was not vaccinated.

## Solicited local and systemic AEs

Age group ≥ 2 to ≤ 5 years

In the age group ≥ 2 to ≤ 5 years, any local AE was reported by 33 subjects (46%) any systemic AE was reported by 19 subjects (26%), and any other AE was reported by 4 subjects (6%). The most

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

commonly reported solicited local AE  was tenderness (27 subjects; 38%), followed by erythema (7 subjects, 10%) and induration (6 subjects, 8%). The majority of solicited local AEs were of mild or moderate  intensity.  One  subject  reported  tenderness  of  severe  intensity  and  one  subject  reported erythema of severe intensity.  The  most  commonly  reported  systemic  AE  was  vomiting  (7  subjects; 10%), followed by irritability (5 subjects; 7%), rash (4 subjects; 6%) and fever ≥38C (4 subjects; 6%).  The  majority  of  systemic  AEs  were  of  mild  or  moderate  intensity  with  the  exception  of  an urticarial  rash  which  was  reported  in  1  subject  (1%).  Antipyretic/analgesic  medications  were administered to 4 subjects (6%).

## Age group ≥ 6 to ≤ 10 years

In the age group ≥ 6 to ≤ 10 years, any local AE was reported by 42 subjects (42%), any systemic AE was reported by 19 subjects (26%), and any other AE was reported by 4 subjects (6%). The most commonly reported solicited local AE was pain (37 subjects; 37%), followed by erythema (17 subjects, 17%)  and  induration  (14  subjects,  14%).  All  of  the  solicited  local  AEs  were  of  mild  or  moderate intensity.  The  most  commonly  reported  systemic  AE  was  myalgia  (20  subjects;  20%),  followed  by malaise  (13  subjects;  13%),  headache  (11  subjects;  11%)  and  nausea  (10  subjects;  10%).  The majority of systemic AEs were of mild or moderate intensity with the exception of urticarial rash which was reported  in  3  subjects  (3%).  There  were  3  subjects  (3%)  who  reported  fever  ≥  38  °C,  and  2 subjects (2%) who were administered antipyretic/analgesic medications.

## Age group ≥ 11 to ≤ 18 years

In the age group ≥ 11 to ≤ 18 years of age, any local AE was reported by 71 subjects (43%), any systemic AE was reported by 63 subjects (38%) and any other AE was reported by 3 subjects (2%). The most commonly reported solicited local AE was pain (62 subjects; 37%), followed by erythema (17 subjects, 10%) and induration (12 subjects, 7%). The majority of solicited local AEs were of mild or moderate  intensity,  with  only  1  subject  reporting  pain  of  severe  intensity.  The  most  commonly reported systemic AE was myalgia (49 subjects; 29%), followed by malaise (35 subjects; 21%) and headache  (29  subjects;  17%).  The  majority  of  systemic  AEs  were  of  mild  or  moderate  intensity. However, severe intensity reactions were reported in 4 subjects (2%) for headache, in 3 subjects (2%) for urticarial rash, in 2 subjects (1%) each for malaise and myalgia and in 1 subject (1%) for arthralgia. There were 2 subjects (1%) who reported fever ≥ 38 °C, and 3 subjects (2%) who were administered antipyretic/analgesic medications.

injection site induration (5 subjects; 3%), dizziness (4 subjects; 2%), upper respiratory tract infection (3 subjects; 2%), headache (2 subjects; 1%), injection site erythema (2 subjects; 1%), injection site swelling  (2  subjects;  1%),  nasopharyngitis  (2  subjects;  1%),  and  oropharyngeal  pain  (2  subjects; 1%). At least possibly related AEs were experienced by 6% of the subjects and were most commonly associated with injection site events or dizziness

## Deaths, other serious adverse events and other significant adverse events

There were no deaths during the study. There was one SAE reported during the study; subject 03/039 who experienced pneumonia of moderate intensity starting on study day 17 and lasting for 15 days. This was considered unrelated to the study drug. There were no AEs leading to premature withdrawal.

## Description

A  phase  3,  multicenter,  open-label  study  to  evaluate  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  Novartis meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-CRM) in healthy children, adolescents, and adults in Russia

## Methods

## Objective(s)

Immunogenicity (all at day 29)

Primary:

- To assess the immunogenicity of a single injection of MenACWY-CRM vaccine as measured by the percentage  of subjects with hSBA  seroresponse1,  directed against N  meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y.

Secondary:

- To assess the immunogenicity of a single injection of MenACWY-CRM vaccine as measured by the percentage  of subjects with hSBA  seroresponse1,  directed against N  meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y by age group (2-10, 11-17, and 18 years and above).
- To assess the immunogenicity of a single injection of MenACWY-CRM vaccine as measured by hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs) and by the percentage of subjects with hSBA titer ≥ 1:8, directed against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y, overall and by age group.

## Safety objectives:

To assess the safety profile following MenACWY-CRM vaccination in terms of percentage and number of subjects with:

- local and systemic reactions reported from study day 1 (day of vaccination) through study day 7 postvaccination;
- all other adverse events (AEs) reported from study day 1 through study day 7 postvaccination;
- serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  and  medically  attended  AEs  and  AEs  resulting  in  premature withdrawal from study day 1 through study day 29.

## Study design

This was a phase 3, multicenter, open-label, single arm study to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of  Novartis  meningococcal  ACWY-CRM  conjugate  vaccine  (MenACWY-CRM)  in  healthy  subjects  in Russia from the age of 2 years (≥2 years).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study population /Sample size

A total of approximately 198 subjects (66 subjects in each age group; ≥2 - ≤10 yrs; ≥11-≤17 yrs; ≥18  yrs)  were  planned  for  enrollment  into  this  study.  Assuming  a  10%  dropout  rate,  this  would provide approximately 60 evaluable subjects in each age group. The sample size of approximately 180 evaluable subjects was considered reasonable based on 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the observed seroresponse.

Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion:

Inclusion  criteria:  Male  and  female  subjects,  from  2  years  of  age  and  above  (≥2  years),  who  were generally  in  good  health,  available  for  all  study  visits,  who  and/or  whose  parent/legally  acceptable representative had given written informed consent at the time of enrollment.

Exclusion criteria: Serious, acute, or chronic illnesses, as well as confirmed pregnancies led to subject exclusion.  Previous  or  suspected  disease  caused  by N  meningitidis or  previous  immunization  with meningococcal vaccine were considered exclusion criteria.

## Treatments

All persons received MenACWY-CRM (cross-reacting material) conjugate vaccine Lot #: M11052 (vialvial presentation).

## Outcomes/endpoints

The following immunogenicity endpoints were assessed for serogroups A, C, W, and Y.

- Primary: Percentages of subjects with hSBA seroresponse. Seroresponse is defined as (a) for subjects  with  a  prevaccination  hSBA  &lt;1:4,  a  postvaccination  hSBA  titer  ≥1:8  or  (b)  for subjects with a prevaccination hSBA ≥1:4, an increase in hSBA titer of at least four times the prevaccination titer
- Secondary: hSBA GMTs and percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8.

Solicited local and systemic AEs:

Selected local and systemic AEs reported from days 1 through 7 after vaccine administration

Unsolicited AEs:

- All AEs other than solicited local and systemic AEs from days 1 through 7.
- Serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  medically  attended  AEs,  and  AEs  resulting  in  premature withdrawal from days 1 through 29.

## Statistical Methods

## Definition of populations to be analyzed:

(a)  All  Enrolled  Population:  All  subjects  who  had  signed  an  informed  consent,  undergone  screening procedure(s), and had a subject number assigned.

- (b) Exposed: All enrolled subjects who actually received study vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(c) Full Analysis Set (FAS) population6, Immunogenicity: This population was defined by serogroup. All subjects in the exposed population who provided one evaluable serum samples whose assay results were available for at least one serogroup at baseline and at day 29.

(d) Per Protocol (PP) Population, Immunogenicity: This population was to be defined by serogroup. All subjects in the FAS who provided evaluable serum samples whose assay results were available for at least one serogroup on day 1 and on day 29 and had no major protocol violations.

Immunogenicity analysis: There was no statistical hypothesis related to the objectives to be tested. Endpoints for each serogroup were descriptively reported for the overall study population and by age group.  For  each  of  the  serogroups  in  the  vaccine,  the  numbers,  percentages,  and  95%  CI  of  the percentages of subjects who have achieved seroresponse were reported. The numbers, percentages, and  95%  CI  of  the  percentages  of  subjects  with  pre-  and  post-vaccination  hSBA  ≥  1:8  were  also summarized. Pre- and postvaccination GMTs and their associated 95% CIs were presented for each serogroup overall and by age group.

Safety analysis: The number and percentage of subjects with the following reports was calculated:

- Solicited  local  and  systemic  adverse  events  reported  during  days  1  through  7  across  age groups- 2 through 3 years (≥2 to ≤3 years), 4 through 5 years (≥4 to ≤5 years), 2 through 5 years (≥2 to ≤5 years), 6 through 10 years (≥6 to ≤ 10 years), 11 through 17 years (≥11 to ≤17 years), 18 years and above (≥18 years) and also overall summary for 6 years and above (≥6 years).
- All  AEs occurring during days 1 through 7 after vaccination across age groups 2 through 10 years (≥2 to ≤10 years), 11 through 17 years (≥11 to ≤17 years), 18 years and above (≥ 18 years)  and  overall  summary  for  2  years  and  above  (≥2  years).  ▫  all  SAEs  and  medically attended AEs and premature withdrawals due to AEs, occurring during days 1 through 29.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

Date of first enrollment: 14 NOV 12; Date of last visit: 19 MAR 13

The primary analysis population for immunogenicity was the Full Analysis Set (FAS). For assessing the robustness of results, the immunogenicity analyses on the primary and secondary endpoints was also assessed  on  the  Per  Protocol  Set  (PPS).  Out  of  the  total  198  subjects,  197  (99%)  subjects  were vaccinated with the study vaccine. One subject (01006) from 2-10 years age group was withdrawn from the study at visit 1 due to withdrawal of consent and did not receive study vaccination

The FAS included 97% of the enrolled subjects (193 subjects). One subject (01006) was excluded from day 1 and day 29 FAS due to withdrawal of consent at visit 1. Additionally 4 subjects (03011, 04012, 05034,  05062)  were  excluded  from  day  29  FAS  as  there  was  no  blood  draw  analyzed  for  these subjects,  therefore  the  postvaccination  hSBA  results  were  not  available.  The  PPS  included  92%  of enrolled subjects. A total of 16 subjects (8%) had major protocol deviations and were excluded from PP immunogenicity analysis. Most common reasons for major protocol deviations were that the blood draw was performed outside the protocol specified window (in 5% of subjects) and samples at visit 2 were not analyzed for 4 subjects (2%) (subjects 03011, 04012, 05034 and 05062) for serogroups A, C, W and Y.

## Baseline data

The  mean age of the overall  study  population  was  19.6  (+15.9)  years  and  a  higher  percentage  of females were enrolled than males (55% versus 45%).

The  mean  age  of  the  2  through  10  years  age  group  was  6  (+2.7)  years  and  a  slightly  higher percentage of females were enrolled than the males (53% versus 47%). The mean age of 11 through 17 years age group was 13.8 (+2.1) years and a higher percentage of males were enrolled than the females (56% versus 44%). The mean age of the  ≥18 years age group was 38.8 (+12.5) years and majority of enrolled subjects were females (67% versus 33% males).

The demographic and baseline characteristics of the FAS and PPS were similar to the enrolled set.

Note: The N's for each serogroup represent total number of subjects for which the serology results are available.

Against serogroup A, in the overall study cohort ( ≥2 years) there were 6% subjects with hSBA≥1:8 at baseline. At 4 weeks after MenACWY vaccination there was a significant increase in the percentage of subjects with hSBA≥1:8 against serogroup A (89% of subjects with hSBA≥1:8). Against serogroup C, at baseline 26% of subjects had hSBA≥1:8 from the overall study cohort. At 4 weeks after vaccination, 84% of subjects from the overall age group had hSBA≥1:8 against this serogroup. Against serogroup W,  at  baseline  57%  of  subjects  from  the  overall  study  cohort  had  hSBA≥1:8.  At  4  weeks  after vaccination,  a  large  proportion  of  subjects  (97%  of  subjects)  from  the  overall  age  group  showed hSBA≥1:8 against serogroup W. Against serogroup Y, at baseline, 16% of subjects from the overall study cohort had hSBA≥1:8. At 4 weeks after vaccination, 88% of subjects showed hSBA≥1:8 against this serogroup.

## CHMP's comments

Again, results are by and large in line with what is known about Menveo. The high % of subjects with baseline titers against MenW is evident in this study too - in particular in persons aged over 11 yrs. In these subjects too you see a reasonable increase in GMTs, in line with the increase seen for MenC, suggesting a good vaccine induced response. Notably, for MenC, MenY and in particular for MenA the response is stronger in subjects aged 11-18 yrs compared to those aged 2-10 years. For MenW the response seems less strong in the 11-18 yr age group.

In general, the immunogenicity findings from the study  are in line with what is known already.

## Safety results

A total of 99% of the enrolled subjects were included in the safety population

## Solicited AEs:

The solicited AEs (local, systemic or other solicited AEs) were reported by 67% of subjects from 2 to 5 years age group and by 64% of subjects from ≥6 years age group. When assessed by age group, the percentage of subjects reporting solicited local, systemic or other solicited AEs in 2 to 3 years, 6 to 10 years, 11 to 17 years and ≥18 years age group was 58% to 67% across these age groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Solicited local AEs were reported by 59% of subjects in 2 to 5 years age group and by 53% of subjects in ≥6 years age group. The percentage of subjects reporting solicited AEs in the age groups 2 to 3 years, 6 to 10 years, 11 to 17 years and .18 years was similar to the overall age groups (2 to 5 years and ≥6 years) (47% to 59% across age groups).

Most  commonly reported solicited  local  AE  in  2  to  5  years  age  group  was  injection  site  tenderness (41%); a similar percentage of subjects in the 2 to 3 years age group reported tenderness (39%). There were no severe local AEs reported in 2 to 5 years age group.

Most commonly reported solicited local AE in ≥6 years age group was injection site pain (48%) and across the age sub-groups. 42% of subjects from 6 to 10 years, 50% of subjects from 11 to 17 years and 50% of subjects from ≥18 years age groups, reported injection site pain.

Solicited  systemic AEs were reported by a low percentage of subjects from 2 to 5 years age group (7%) and 2 to 3 years age group reported 11% of subjects with such AEs. The ≥6 years age group reported 40% of subjects with solicited systemic AEs and across age sub-groups, 32% from 6 to 10 years, 45% from 11 to 17 years and 39% from ≥18 years age groups reported systemic AEs.

Most commonly reported systemic AEs in the ≥6 years age group and in age sub-groups was headache (25% in ≥6 years), malaise (20% in ≥6 years) and myalgia (19% in  ≥6 years). Severe systemic AEs were reported by a low percentage of subjects (≤4%).

## Unsolicited AEs (including solicited AEs continuing past day 7):

The unsolicited AEs (including solicited AEs continuing past day 7) with onset within days 1 to 7, were reported by 17% of subjects in the overall study cohort (≥2 years of age); most of the unsolicited AEs were solicited local and systemic AEs continuing past 7-day window and these were assessed to be at least possibly related to the study vaccination (10%). Medically attended AEs were reported by 4% of subjects in the overall study cohort and across age sub-groups 2% to 8% subjects reported medically attended AEs. The most commonly reported unsolicited AEs by subjects in 2 to 10 years age group were rhinitis (8%), oropharyngeal pain (3%) and nasopharyngitis (3%). The 11 to 17 years age group commonly reported injection site swelling (5%), injection site pain (3%) and injection site erythema (3%). The ≥18 years age group commonly reported injection site induration (6%) and other injection site AEs such as erythema (5%), pain (3%), and pruritus (3%).

## Deaths, serious adverse events or other significant adverse events

No  deaths  were  reported  in  the  study.  None  of  the  subjects  reported  SAEs  and  there  were  no premature withdrawals due to AEs.

## CHMP's comments

The incidence of AEs is in line with other studies - there is no new safety signal.

## V59P14E1

## Description

A  Phase  3b,  Open-Label,  Controlled,  Multicenter  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Persistence  Of  Antibody Responses Among Children Who Previously Received Novartis MenACWY Conjugate Vaccine, conducted in US.

| comments   | CHMP's   |
|------------|----------|

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Note that the 40 month CSR has been reviewed in context of variation II-18.

V59P14E1 evaluated persistence in children 40 months of age who received 4 doses at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months or either 1 or 2 doses between 12-18 months. Among subjects who received 4 doses rates for hSBA titer ≥8 at 40 months were 10% for A, 34% for C, 76% for W and 67% for Y.  Among those who received 1-2 doses rates were 35% for A, 51% for C, 83% for W and 71% for Y.

## Methods

## Objective(s)

Immunogenicity Objectives:

Primary

▫  To  evaluate  the  persistence  of  the  antibody  response  in  children  of  40  and  60  months  of  age previously vaccinated with MenACWY in study V59P14, as measured by percentage of subjects with human Serum Bactericidal Assay (hSBA) titers ≥1:8 directed against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y.

Secondary

▫  To  evaluate  the  persistence  of  the  antibody  response  in  children  of  40  and  60  months  of  age previously vaccinated with MenACWY in study V59P14, as measured by the percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥1:4 and hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs) directed against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y.

▫  To  evaluate  the  functional  antibody  levels  in  children  of  40  and  60  months  of  age  who  were  not previously vaccinated with meningococcal vaccine, as measured by percentage of subjects with hSBA titers  ≥  1:4,  percentage  of  subjects  with  hSBA  titers  ≥1:8,  and  hSBA  GMTs  directed  against  N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y.

▫  To  evaluate  the  antibody  response  of  MenACWY  given  at  60  months  of  age  in  children  who  had previously received at least one dose of Novartis MenACWY vaccine in study V59P14 compared to the antibody response to one dose of MenACWY in meningococcal vaccine-naive subjects, as measured by percentage of subjects with seroresponse, the percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥1:8, and the percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥1:4 directed against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y, at 1 month1 postvaccination.

Safety Objectives:

▫ To assess the safety and tolerability of a booster dose of MenACWY in subjects who were previously vaccinated with MenACWY.

▫  To  assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of MenACWY in meningococcal vaccine naive subjects 60 months of age.

## Study design

This was a phase 3b, multicenter, open-label, controlled study. All US sites participating in the V59P14 trial  that  had  adequate  enrollment  were  approached  to participate  in  this  extension  study.  Subjects from the parent V59P14 study who received either 4 doses of MenACWY (ACWY-42) or 1 or 2 doses of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

MenACWY  (ACWY-23),  were  included  in  this  extension  study  and  administered  a  booster  dose  of MenACWY at 60 months of age.

Subjects in the ACWY-4 group received a primary vaccination schedule of 3 doses 2 months apart (2, 4 and 6 months of age) followed by a fourth dose at 12 or 13 months. Subjects in the ACWY-2 group received the first dose at 12 or 13 months and the second dose at 15 months of age or a single dose at 18 months. A group of naive subjects (Naive404 and Naive605), age-matched to the subjects in the ACWY-4 and ACWY-2 groups, were enrolled at visit 9 (40 months of age) and visit 10 (60 months of age), respectively and served as a reference for immunogenicity analyses.

## Study population /Sample size

Subjects who participated in the V59P14 trial were recruited for this extension study.

Target enrollment for this extension study was 500 subjects. A total of approximately 400 subjects who participated in study V59P14 were to be enrolled (ACWY-4 and ACWY-2) at 40 and 60 months of age.  Additionally,  a  total  of  approximately  50  naïve  subjects  40  months  of  age  (Naive40)  and  60 months of age (Naive60) were to be recruited age-matched with ACWY-4 and ACWY-2 at visit 9 and 10, respectively.

Children  eligible  to  be  enrolled  in  the  study  were  those  whose  parents  provided  written  informed consent, and who were generally in good health based on the clinical judgment of the investigators. ACWY-4 and ACWY-2 subjects should have participated in the original V59P14 study and have been 40±3 months of age at the time of the 40-month visit (visit 9) and 60±3 months of age at the time of the 60-month visit (visit 10).

Naive 40 and Naive60 subjects were healthy, meningococcal vaccine-naive children aged 40±3 months (visit 9) or 60±3 months (visit 10), respectively, at the time of enrollment.

Serious, acute, or chronic illnesses were reasons for exclusion. Other exclusion criteria included the following:

▫ Subjects who received any vaccine (excluding influenza vaccines) 28 days preceding the enrollment visit.  Influenza  vaccines  (including  FluMist®)  were  excluded for the 14 days prior to the enrollment visit.

▫ Subjects who received any meningococcal vaccine since birth (Naive60) or last study vaccination in the V59P14 trial (ACWY-4 and ACWY-2).

## Treatments

Novartis  MenACWY  [Lot  Numbers:  (vial/prefilled  syringe;  PFS)  Lot  no.  091601A  (expiry  date  April, 2013);  (vial/vial)  Lot  no.  M11016  (expiry  date  August,  2012)]  was  obtained  by  extemporaneous mixing just before injection of the lyophilized MenA component with the liquid MenCWY component. One 0.5 mL dose of MenACWY was administered by intramuscular (IM) injection in the left deltoid.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Immunogenicity Endpoints:

Primary

▫ Percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥1:8 for serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary

- Percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥1:4 for serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y;
- hSBA GMTs.

Safety Endpoints

▫ The percentages of subjects with solicited local and systemic AEs within 7 days after vaccination with MenACWY.

▫ The percentages of subjects with unsolicited AEs within 7 days after vaccination with MenACWY and SAEs, medically attended AEs, and AEs resulting in premature withdrawal for 28 days after vaccination at 60 months (from visit 10 through visit 11).

## Statistical Methods

There  is  no  statistical  hypothesis  associated  with  the  immunogenicity  objective.  All  analyses  are descriptive. The primary analysis was performed on the per protocol set (PPS).

## Primary measures of immunogenicity:

Percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA  .1:8  and  associated  2-sided  95%  Clopper-Pearson  confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for each serogroup and for each vaccination group and visit. There is no formal statistical hypothesis associated with this endpoint.

## Secondary measures of immunogenicity:

Persistence at 40 and 60 months of age in subjects previously vaccinated with MenACWY as infants or toddlers in study V59P14. The percentages of subjects with hSBA titer ≥1:4 against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y and associated 2 sided 95% Clopper- Pearson CIs were calculated and presented by vaccine group. For subjects in the Naive60 group, the percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 were also calculated.

Geometric  mean  titers  (GMT)  at  the  three  timepoints  (visits  9,  10,  11)  were  calculated  for  each serogroup  and  for  each  vaccine  group  with  available  data  at  the  visits.  The  hSBA  titers  were logarithmically  transformed  (base10)  and  GMTs  and  associated  2-sided  95%  CIs  computed  by exponentiating (base10) the corresponding log-transformed means and 95% confidence limits for the log-transformed means. These were obtained from an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with vaccine group and center as effects in the model. Titers below the limit of detection were set to half that limit for the purposes of the analysis. Titers reported as being above a cutoff value, were set to that cutoff value in the analyses.

## Immune response at 1 month after vaccination with MenACWY

The  percentage  of  subjects  in  ACWY-4,  ACWY-2  and  Naive60  groups  with  hSBA≥1:8,  hSBA≥1:4 against N.  meningitidis serogroups  A,  C,  W  and  Y  and  associated  two  sided  95%  Clopper-  Pearson confidence interval (CIs) were calculated at baseline (Visit 10) and 1 month after vaccination (Visit 11) for each serogroup and were presented by vaccine group

Geometric  Mean  Titer  (GMT)  at  the  three  timepoints  (visits  9,  10,  11)  was  calculated  for  each serogroup  and  for  each  vaccine  group  with  available  data  at  the  visit.  The  hSBA  titers  were logarithmically transformed (base10).

## Baseline data

The mean age of subjects at enrollment was 59.7 months, 59.6 months and 60 months in the ACWY-4, ACWY-2 and Naive60 groups, respectively (Table 11.2-1). There were more males than females in both the ACWY-4 (53% and 47%, respectively) and ACWY-2 (53% and 47% respectively) vaccine groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Naive60 group had more females (58%) than males (42%). The most commonly reported ethnic origin in all 3 groups was Caucasian (44% to 67% across groups).

Weight  and  height  were  not  measured  at  60  months  of  age  (visit  10)  for  subjects  in  ACWY-4  and ACWY-2 groups. Mean weight and height of subjects enrolled in the Naïve 60 group were 20.06 kg and 110.71 cm, respectively (Table 11.2-1).

Subject 35/337 did not meet the age eligibility criterion at the 40-month visit and is excluded from the 40

month PPS. However, this subject did meet the age criterion at the 60-month visit and is included in the 60

month PPs (Appendix 16.2.2.2).

## Efficacy results

The percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 against 4 serogroups at 60 months of age are presented in Table 11.4.1-1.

Specifically, for groups ACWY-2, ACWY-4, and Naive60, the percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 against serogroup A were 25%, 6% and 2%, respectively; 43%, 27% and 22% for serogroup C; 74%, 69%, and 40% for serogroup W-135; and 69%, 56%, and 25% for serogroup Y.

Antibody  levels  against  serogroups  W  and  Y  were  higher  for  both  groups  than  background  rates  of bactericidal  antibodies  in  age-matched  naive  control  (Naive60).  For  serogroups  A  and  C,  antibody levels were higher than those of naive control (Naive60) for subjects who had received 1 or 2 doses of MenACWY (ACWY-2) in the parent study. Among subjects who received the 4-dose infant series in the parent study (ACWY-4), antibody levels against serogroups A and C were generally only slightly higher than those of naive control (Naive60).

## CHMP's comments

Note that in the ACWY-4 group  the antibody levels are not much different to those in the naïve group. Similarly for MenC, where 95% CIs also overlap.

The antibody response was assessed at 2,7,12,13, 40 and 60 months of age in subjects for whom serological data from the V59P14 study were available as measured by the percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 and GMTs. The persistence of bactericidal antibodies in children 40 and 60 months of age  previously  vaccinated  with  MenACWY  was  also  evaluated  as  measured  by  hSBA  GMTs  and percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥1:4 against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y.

The antibody response of MenACWY given at 60 months of age in children who had previously received at  least  one  dose  of  Novartis  MenACWY  vaccine  in  study  V59P14  was  compared  to  the  antibody response to one dose of MenACWY in meningococcal vaccine-naive subjects. This was measured by percentage  of  subjects  with  seroresponse,  percentage  of  subjects  with  hSBA  titers  'd  1:8,  and percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 1:4 directed against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y at 28 days postvaccination.

The results are presented in the tables below.

## Summary of main immunogenicity results

## 60-Month Persistence:

- The observed percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 at 60 -months of age in the ACWY-4, ACWY-2 and  Naive60  groups  were:  6%,  25%  and  2%,  respectively,  for  serogroup  A,  27%,  43%  and  22%, respectively, for serogroup C, 69%, 74% and 40%, respectively, for serogroup W-135, and 56%, 69% and 25%, respectively, for serogroup Y.
- The observed percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥1:4 at 60-months of age in the ACWY-4, ACWY-2 and  Naive60  groups  were:  9%,  33%  and  2%,  respectively,  for  serogroup  A,  46%,  60%  and  33%,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

respectively, for serogroup C, 74%, 83% and 42%, respectively, for serogroup W-135, and 65%, 74% and 25%, respectively, for serogroup Y  (Table 11.4.1-4).

▫ Geometric mean titers at 60-months of age in the ACWY-4, ACWY-2 and Naive60 groups were: 2.27, 3.74 and 2.14, respectively, for serogroup A, 5.17, 9.26 and 3.87, respectively, for serogroup C, 17, 20  and  6.63,  respectively  for  serogroup  W-135,  and  11,  14  and  4.1,  respectively,  for  serogroup  Y (Table 11.4.1-4).

## Immune response to MenACWY:

▫  The percentages of subjects in the ACWY-4, ACWY-2 and Naive60 groups with seroresponse at 28 days  after  the  MenACWY-CRM  vaccination  at  60-months  of  age  were:  97%,  96%  and  87%, respectively,  for  serogroup  A,  87%,  87%  and  73%,  respectively,  for  serogroup  C,  99%,  100%  and 57%,  respectively,  for  serogroup  W,  and  98%,  99%  and  52%,  respectively,  for  serogroup  Y.  The vaccine group difference  was significantly  higher  than  0%  for  all  serogroups  for  the  ACWY-4  minus Naive60 comparison and for serogroups W and Y for the ACWY-2 minus Naive60 comparison (lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the vaccine group difference was greater than 0%; Table 11.4.1-5).

▫ The observed percentages of subjects in the ACWY-4, ACWY-2 and Naive60 groups with hSBA ≥1:8 at  28  days  after  the  MenACWY-CRM  vaccination  at  60-months  of  age  were:  97%,  97%  and  87%, respectively, for serogroup A, 96%, 99% and 84%, respectively, for serogroup C, 100%, 100% and 89%, respectively, for serogroup W, and 100%, 100% and 73%, respectively, for serogroup Y. The vaccine  group  difference  was  significantly  higher  than  0%  for  all  serogroups  for  both  the  ACWY-4 minus Naive60 comparison as well as for the ACWY-2 minus Naive60 comparison (lower limit of the 2sided 95% CI for the vaccine group difference was greater than 0%; Table 11.4.1-5).

▫ The observed percentages of subjects in the ACWY-4, ACWY-2 and Naive60 groups with hSBA ≥1:4 at  28  days  after  the  MenACWY-CRM  vaccination  at  60-months  of  age  were:  97%,  97%  and  89%, respectively, for serogroup A, 97%, 100% and 87%, respectively, for serogroup C, 100%, 100% and 91%, respectively, for serogroup W, and 100%, 100% and 80%, respectively, for serogroup Y. The vaccine  group  difference  was  significantly  higher  than  0%  for  serogroups  C,  W  and  Y  for  both  the ACWY-4 minus Naive60 comparison as well as for the ACWY-2 minus Naive60 comparison (lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the vaccine group difference was greater than 0%; Table 11.4.1-5).

▫ Geometric mean titers in the ACWY-4, ACWY-2 and Naive60 groups at 28 days after the MenACWY vaccination at 60-months of age were: 159, 330 and 47, respectively, for serogroup A, 195, 569 and 44, respectively, for serogroup C, 1950, 1645 and 37, respectively, for serogroup W, and 1089, 922 and 18, respectively, for serogroup Y.

The  ratio  of  the  least  square  GMTs  was  significantly  higher  than  1  for  all  serogroups  for  both  the ACWY-4 vs. Naive60 comparison as well as for the ACWY-2 vs. Naive60 comparison (lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the vaccine group ratio was greater than 1). Additionally, the ratio of the ACWY-4 vs. ACWY-2 least square GMTs was significantly lower than 1 for serogroups A and C (upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the vaccine group ratio was less than 1; Table 11.4.1-5).

## CHMP's comments

Antibody persistence is greater among subjects in the MenACWY2 group compared to those who had received the 4-dose infant series - this is  likely  attributable to the  age  at when  the  final  dose  was received  or  could  reflect  the  maturity  of  the  immune  system  at  the  time  of  priming.  The  low

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

persistence for MenA seen here is in line with earlier observations in other studies and resulted in a warning  in  the  SmPC.  Moreover,  an  update  of  section  4.2  based  upon  further  persistence  data  is currently being considered in variation II/42. Note that the MAH indicates that an increasing numbers of  publications  are  suggesting  that  hSBA  need not be an optimal assay for persistence assessment, especially  for  serogroup  A.  The  greatest  difference  observed  between  immunogenicity  results  using hSBA and rSBA assays. A discrepancy could be attributable to known differences between assays due to differences in target strain susceptibilities for the complement sources (Findlow H, 2009, Poolman JT, 2011).

The response to vaccination with MenACWY is clearly better in those subjects vaccinated previously with MenACWY compared tot the Naive60 group.

As the present data are collected in subjects outside the indication and do not add to what is already known about the vaccine they do not need to be included in the SmPC.

## Safety results

All subjects received a single dose of MenACWY on day 1, at approximately 60 months of age. Subjects in group ACWY-4 had previously received 4 doses of MenACWY, at 2, 4, 6 and 12 or 13 months of age; those  in  study  group  ACWY-2  had  previously  received  either  2  doses  of  MenACWY,  at  12  and  15 months or at 13 and 15 months of age, or a single dose of MenACWY at 18 months of age. Subjects in study  group  Naïve-60  had  not  previously  received  any  MenACWY  vaccination.  Among  all  treated subjects, 98% in both the ACWY-4 and ACWY-2 study groups were included in the overall safety set, while 100% of the subjects in the Naive60 group constituted the overall safety set.

## Local and systemic solicited AEs

The  frequencies  of  subjects  who  reported  solicited  AEs  in  any  category  were  similar  between  the AWCY-4 and ACWY-2 study groups, and were somewhat higher in the Naive60 group. Among subjects in  the  ACWY-4,  ACWY-2,  and  Naive60  groups,  62%,  64%,  and  76%,  respectively,  reported  any solicited AEs; 52%, 53%, and 59%, respectively, reported any local solicited AEs; and 35%, 31%, and 47%,  respectively,  reported  any  systemic  solicited  AEs.  Any  other  indicator  of  reactogenicity  was reported by 13% to 14% of subjects for all 3 study groups. Severe local AEs were reported by 7% and 11%  of  subjects  in  the  ACWY-4  and  ACWY-2  groups,  respectively,  versus  14%  of  subjects  in  the Naive60 group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  most  commonly  reported  was  pain,  in  42%,  40%,  and  49%  of  subjects,  respectively.  Smaller percentages  of  subjects  reported  each  of  the  other  local  solicited  AEs:  20%,  24%,  and  27%, respectively, reported erythema and 14%, 17%, and 20%, respectively, reported induration. For each of  these  local  AEs,  differences  between  groups  were  small,  and  did  not  approach  statistical significance. None of the subjects reported severe pain. Severe erythema (&gt; 100 mm) was reported by

2 subjects (2%) in the ACWY-4 group, none in the ACWY-2 group, and one in the Naive60 group, while severe induration (&gt; 100 mm) was reported by a single subject in the ACWY-4 group and none of the subjects in the ACWY-2 and Naive60 groups.

The  most  commonly  reported  were  irritability,  reported  by  19%,  17%,  and  16%  of  subjects, respectively, and sleepiness, reported by 16%, 11%, and 14% of subjects, respectively. The only other systemic  solicited  AE  reported  by  &gt;  10%  of  subjects  in  either  group  was  change  in  eating  habits, reported by 11%, 6%, and 8% of subjects, respectively. There were no appreciable patterns in the frequencies of AEs among the study groups.

## Unsolicited AEs

Previously vaccinated subjects:

From day 1 through day 7 postvaccination, a total of 7%, 8%, and 12% of subjects in the ACWY-4, ACWY-2, and Naive60 study groups, respectively, reported 1 or more unsolicited AEs. The only AEs, by preferred term, reported by more than 2 subjects in any group were pyrexia, in 3 (2%), 1 (1%), and 2 (4%) subjects in the ACWY-4, ACWY-2, and Naive60 groups, respectively, and cough, in 2 (2%), 3 (3%), and 0 subjects in the ACWY-4, ACWY-2, and Naive60 groups, respectively. The only SOCs in which more than 2 subjects in any group reported an AE were 'general disorders and administration site conditions' (4 (3%), 2 (2%), and 3 (6%) subjects in the ACWY-4, ACWY-2, and Naive60 groups, respectively), and 'respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders'(with 3 (2%), 3 (3%), and 1 (2%) subjects in the 3 groups, respectively), and 'infections and infestations' (with 2 (2%), 0 and 3 (6%) subjects in the 3 groups, respectively; Table 12.2.3-2).

The only AE, from day 1 through day 7 postvaccination that was considered at least possibly related to vaccination  by  more  than  1  subject  was  pyrexia:  it  was  considered  at  least  possibly  related  in  4 subjects across 3 study groups (Table 12.2.3-2).

From day 8 postvaccination through study termination (nominally 28 days postvaccination), a total of 8%,  13%,  and  10%  of  subjects  in  the  ACWY-4,  ACWY-2,  and  Naive60  study  groups,  respectively, reported 1 or more unsolicited medically-attended AEs. The only AEs, by preferred term, reported in more than 2 subjects in any study group was conjunctivitis, in 0, 1 (1%), and 3 (6%) subjects in the ACWY-4, ACWY-2, and Naive60 groups, respectively. The only SOCs in which AEs were reported, from day  8  postvaccination  through  study  termination,  by  more  than  2  subjects  in  any  group  were 'infections and infestations,' reported by 8 (6%), 6 (7%), and 1 (2%) subjects in the ACWY-4, ACWY2, and Naive60 groups, respectively, 'respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders,' reported by 1 (1%), 1 (1%), and 3 (6%) subjects in the 3 groups, respectively, and 'eye disorders,' reported by 0, 1 (1%), and 3 (6%) subjects in the 3 groups, respectively.

There were no deaths or SAEs in this study. No subject withdrew prematurely from the study due to an AE.

Chronic  conditions  with  new  onset  reported  from  termination  of  the  parent  study  (V59P14),  at approximately 18 through 21 months of age, through Visit 10 of the current study, at approximately 60 months of age, were recorded for subjects in the ACWY-4 and ACWY-2 groups.

The most commonly reported chronic conditions with new onset in the ACWY-4 and ACWY-2 groups were asthma (13% and 10% of subjects, respectively) and allergic rhinitis (8% and 5%, respectively).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  addition,  3% of subjects in each group reported 'contact dermatitis and other eczema' as a new chronic  disease.  Other  than  'certain  adverse  effects  not  elsewhere  classified'  in  the  injury  and poisoning  SOC,  no  other  chronic  condition,  by  preferred  term,  was  reported  in  more  than  2%  of subjects  in  either  the  ACWY-4  or  ACWY-2  group.  Among  subjects  in  the  Naive60  group,  the  most commonly reported new chronic conditions, by preferred term, were 'specific delays in development' in 6 subjects (13%), 'personal history of allergy to medicinal agents', asthma and 'certain adverse effects not elsewhere classified', each in 4 subjects (9%), and allergic rhinitis and 'contact dermatitis or other eczema', each in 3 subjects (7%).

The  profile  of  new  onset  chronic  conditions  reported  by  subjects  since  the  end  of  the  parent  study V59P14 is consistent with diseases typical for the age group enrolled, suggesting acceptable longterm vaccine safety.

## CHMP's comments

No safety concerns were identified during the study. The frequencies of solicited AEs were similar to the previously reported in this age group.

## V59\\_33

## Description

This  phase III open  label, randomized,  controlled, multicentre study aimed  to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of four doses of MenACWY when administered concomitantly with routine vaccines to healthy infants at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age, conducted in US, Canada and Australia.

## Methods

## Objective(s)

## Primary Immunogenicity Objectives

1. To assess the sufficiency of the immune response following 4 doses of MenACWY vaccine given at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months in healthy infants in terms of the proportion of subjects with an hSBA ≥1:8 at 1 month post vaccination, for each of the four meningococcal vaccine serogroups.

## Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives

1. To evaluate the hSBA GMTs after 4 doses of MenACWY at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months against each of the four MenACWY serogroups.

2. To evaluate the proportion of subjects with post vaccination hSBA ≥1:8, fourfold rise, and hSBA GMTs after 3 doses of MenACWY at 2, 4, and 6 months against each of the four MenACWY serogroups.

3.  To  demonstrate  that  the  immune  responses  to  routine  concomitant  vaccinations  (pneumococcal, IPV, HBV, Hib, DTaP) are non-inferior when given with MenACWY compared with when given without MenACWY.

4. To assess the persistence of MenACWY immune responses at 12 months of age prior to the fourth dose.

5.  To  evaluate  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  four-fold  rise  in  hSBA  at  1  month  post  4th  dose  as compared to the pre-4th dose hSBA against each of the four MenACWY serogroups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety Objectives

To assess the safety of MenACWY when given concomitantly with routine infant vaccines at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age (i.e., DTaP, IPV, pneumococcal conjugate, HBV and Hib at 2, 4 and 6 months of age and MMR and pneumococcal conjugate at 12 months of age).

## Study design

This was an open label, randomized, controlled, multicentre study. Eligible subjects were randomized at visit 1 to receive either MenACWY and concomitant routine vaccines or routine vaccines only in a 1:1 ratio.  Group  1  subjects  received  four  injections  of  MenACWY  plus  concomitant  routine  vaccinations. Group 2 subjects received only routine vaccination through the time of the blood draw at 13 month visit,  with  one  dose  of  MenACWY  given  at  18  months  of  age.  An  overview  of  the  study  design  is provided below.

## Study population /Sample size

Health infants (aged 55-89 days at enrolment) who were born after an estimated gestational age ≥37 weeks and a birth weight of ≥ 2.5 kg, without any history of confirmed or suspected disease caused by agents to which vaccination was intended nor with a history of vaccination with vaccines given in study (meningococcal, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio (IPV), H. influenzae type b (Hib) or pneumococcus vaccines).

A total of 520 subjects (260 subjects per group) were planned to be enrolled in the study.

## Treatments

Group 1: MenACWY conjugate vaccine along with routine vaccinations intramuscularly at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age.

Group 2: Routine vaccinations intramuscularly at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age. In addition subjects were offered a dose of MenACWY conjugate vaccine at 18 months as a benefit of participating in this study.

Safety Endpoints

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety  was  assessed  for  all  subjects  in  terms  of  the  frequency  and  percentage  of  subjects  with reported SAEs or medically attended AEs.

## Statistical Methods

Primary Immunogenicity Objectives:

- a. The primary immunogenicity objective was to show sufficiency of the immune response as measured by the percentage of subjects with serum bactericidal activity (hSBA) ≥1:8 at 1 month following the fourth dose of MenACWY given to infants at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age.

H0: PMenA ≤0. 80 or PMenC ≤0.85 or PMenW ≤0.85 or PMenY ≤0.85

H1: PMenA &gt;0.80 and PMenC &gt;0.85 and PMenW &gt;0.85 and PMenY &gt;0.85

Where PMenA, C, W, or Y was the proportion of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 at 1 month following the fourth dose of MenACWY. The study was considered a success if the lower limit of the 95% CI for each serogroup met the levels as specified above.

Key Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives:

- a.  The  null  hypothesis  associated  with  the  pertussis  non-inferiority  objective  was  that  for  either  PT, FHA,  pertactin,  or  FIM,  the  lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  95%  CI  for  the  ratio  of  the  GMCs (GMCMenACWY +Pentacel / GMCPentacel) at 1 month after the 6-month vaccination (third dose) was less than or equal to 0.67.

```
H0: GMCMenACWY +Pentacel / GMCPentacel ≤0.67
```

H1: GMCMenACWY +Pentacel / GMCPentacel &gt;0.67

The  other  key  secondary  endpoint  for  the  pertussis  antigens  non-inferiority  assessments  was  the percentage of subjects with seroresponse at 1 month after the 6-month vaccination.

```
H0: PMenACWY+Pentacel - PPentacel ≤-10% H1: PMenACWY+Pentacel - PPentacel >-10%
```

- b. The null hypothesis associated with the pneumococcal non-inferiority objective was that for any of the seven serotypes in Prevnar/Prevenar, the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the ratio of the GMCs (GMCMenACWY + Prevnar / GMCPrevnar ) at 1 month after the 12-month vaccination (fourth dose) was less than or equal to 0.50.

```
H0: GMCMenACWY + Prevnar / GMCPrevnar ≤0. 50 H1: GMCMenACWY + Prevnar / GMCPrevnar >0.50
```

The  other  key  secondary  endpoint  for  the  pneumococcal  non-inferiority  assessments  was  the percentage of subjects with antibody level ≥0.35 μg/mL at 1 month after dose 3.

```
H0: PMenACWY+Prevnar - PPrevnar ≤-10% H1: PMenACWY+Prevnar - PPrevnar >-10%
```

- c. The null hypothesis associated with other key secondary non-inferiority immunogenicity objectives was  that,  for  Hib,  diphtheria,  tetanus,  poliovirus  and  HBV  antigens  administered  with  and  without MenACWY, the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference between the groups (PRoutine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Vaccine + MenACWY minus PRoutine Vaccine) in the percentage of subjects with antibody response greater than or equal to the antigen-specific cut-off level was ≤-10% (-5% for the polio antigens)

H0 PRoutine Vaccine + MenACWY - PRoutine Vaccine ≤-Δ%

H1 PRoutine Vaccine + MenACWY - PRoutine Vaccine &gt;-Δ%

Where -Δ% is -5% for polio antigens and -10% for all others.

The primary and secondary objectives were based on the PP populations which included subjects who received  all  vaccinations,  provided  blood  draws  within  a  pre-specified  window,  and  had  no  major protocol deviations. The primary objective was also assessed using the modified intent to treat (MITT) population. Subjects who were exposed but excluded from the per protocol analyses for immunogenicity were still evaluable for safety.

To address the multiplicity issue the non-inferiority testing was performed sequentially.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 529 subjects were enrolled and were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either MenACWY concomitantly  with  routine  vaccines  (N=258)  or  routine  vaccines  alone  (N=271).  A  total  of  525 (255+270)  subjects  were  analyzed  for  safety,  411  (202+209)  subjects  were  included  in  infant  per protocol (PP) analysis and 352 (172+180) subjects were included in toddler PP analysis.

## Baseline data

The demographic and other baseline characteristics were similar between subjects receiving MenACWY concomitantly with routine vaccines vaccination (Group 1) and those receiving only routine vaccinations (Group 2).

One month post-toddler dose  (13  months),  89%,  95%,  97%  and  96%  of  the  subjects  in  Group  1 achieved an hSBA ≥1:8 against serogroups A, C, W and Y, respectively. The percentages were very low (1%-7%) in the routine vaccination only group (Group 2). The lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI (83%, 90%, 93% and 92%) were greater than 80%, 85%, 85% and 85% for MenA, MenC, MenW and MenY, respectively in subjects who received MenACWY vaccination (Table 11.4.1-1). Thus, the primary objective was met.

## Secondary Objectives:

## 1.  Immune  response  after  three  doses  of  infant  vaccination  series  (PP  infant  MenACWY Population)

hSBA ≥1:8

At baseline (day 1), the percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 were similar between the two groups (A:  2%  vs,  1%,  C:  7%  each,  W:  13%  vs.  15%,  Y:  8%  vs.  4%).  One  month  postinfant  series

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vaccination (7 months), 76%, 94%, 98% and 94% of the subjects in Group 1 achieved hSBA ≥1:8 against serogroups A, C, W and Y, respectively. The percentages remained very low (1%-3%) after the infant series in routine vaccination only group (Group 2) (Table 11.4.1-2).

## At Least Four-Fold Rise in hSBA

One month post-infant series vaccination (7 months), 78%, 94%, 93% and 93% of the subjects in Group  1  had  at  least  four-fold  rise  in  hSBA  against  serogroups  A,  C,  W  and  Y,  respectively.  The percentages were very low (1%-2%) after the infant series routine vaccination only group (Group 2) (Table 11.4.1-2).

## hSBA GMTs

The hSBA GMTs in Group 1 increased over the baseline (A: 2.09 to 21, C: 2.49 to 74, W: 2.94 to 79, Y: 2.52 to 51) while those in Group 2 remained at the similar levels of baseline against each of the serogroups (Table 11.4.1-2).

Similar responses in terms of hSBA ≥1:8 and hSBA GMTs were observed in the subset of the infants who continued in the study to receive a toddler dose (PP toddler MenACWY population; Table 11.4.13).

## 2. Persistence of MenACWY immune responses at 12 months of age

Prior to toddler dose (12 months), 37%, 70% and 53% of the subjects in Group 1 maintained an hSBA ≥1:8 against serogroups C, W and Y, respectively. The percentages were low against serogroup A in Group 1 (7%) and also against all serogroups in Group 2 (2%-5%) (Table 11.4.1-3).

hSBA GMTs and associated 95% CI were assessed at 12 months of age prior to the fourth dose. The hSBA GMTs were higher in Group 1 compared with those in Group 2 for the serogroups C (5.98 vs. 2.15), W (15 vs. 2.23) and Y (8.39 vs. 2.09) while the hSBA GMTs were similar for serogroup A (2.52 vs. 2.12) (Table 11.4.1-3).

## CHMP's comments

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In line with results from earlier studies the persistence for MenA is very poor between the 3 rd dose of MenACWY at 6 months and the subsequent dose at 12 months. A strong decline in antibodies against MenC is also seen, from 96% after the 3 rd dose to 37% prior to the fourth.

## 3. hSBA GMTs after 4 doses of MenACWY (Toddler MenACWY PP Population)

One month after the toddler dose (13 months of age), the hSBA GMTs in Group 1 were significantly higher compared to Group 2 for all vaccine serogroups (A: 54 vs. 1.87, C: 135 vs. 1.94, W: 215 vs. 2.15; Y: 185 vs. 1.89) (Table 11.4.1-3; Figure 11.4.1-1).

## 4. At least four-fold rise in hSBA after toddler dose (PP Toddler MenACWY Population)

One month post-toddler dose (13 months of age), 89%, 92%, 95% and 96% of the subjects in Group 1 had at least four-fold rise in hSBA against serogroups A, C, W and Y, respectively. The percentages remained very low (1%-2%) after the 12-month vaccination in the routine vaccination group (Group 2) (Table 11.4.1-3).

## 5. Immune responses to routine vaccine antigens

The ratio  of  GMCs  (GMCMenACWY + Pentacel GMCPentacel) for the pertussis antigens ranged from 1.02 - 1.09 with the lower limit of two sided 95% CI (0.81 to 0.9) being greater than 0.67 for each antigen. The non-inferiority objectives for pertussis antigens after infant series in terms of GMC were demonstrated.

The  lower  limit  of  two  sided  95%  CI  for  the  difference  in  the  seroresponse  rates  between  groups (PPentacel + MenACWY PPentacel) for FHA and pertactin was greater than -10% while for PT it was 12.1% and for FIM it was -10.6%.

Because the group difference for PT and FIM in the percentage of subjects with seroresponse did not meet the required non-inferiority criterion, the multiplicity procedure required that testing be stopped.

## Results post-infant series

The lower limit of two sided 95% CI for the difference between the antibody response rates (PRoutine Vaccine + MenACWY minus PRoutine Vaccine) for diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and Hib was greater than  -10%  (met  non-inferiority  margin).  For  all  polio  antigens  (types  1,  2,  3)  the  difference  was greater than -5% (met non-inferiority margin).

The difference between Group 1 and Group 2 in percentage of subjects with antibody concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL varied from 0 to -5%, the lower limit of 95% CI on the difference was greater than -10% (met non-inferiority margin) for all of the antigens except for PnC 6B (-10.3%) and PnC 23F (-11.4%).

The ratio of GMCs (GMC Routine Vaccine + MenACWY GMCRoutine Vaccine) or GMTs for diphtheria, tetanus, poliovirus, HBV and Hib antigens ranged from 0.83 - 1.36 with the lower limit of two sided

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

95% CI being greater than 0.50.The results demonstrated that the pre-defined equivalency criteria for these  antigens  were  achieved.  The  ratio  of  GMCs  (GMCMenACWY  +  routine  /  GMCRoutine)  for  the pneumococcal antigens ranged from 0.79 - 0.96 with the lower limit of two sided 95% CI (0.62 to 0.81) being greater than pre-defined margin of 0.5 for each antigen.

## Results post-toddler dose

One month post-toddler dose (13 months), the ratio of GMCs (GMC MenACWY + Prevnar GMCPrevnar) for  the  pneumococcal  antigens  ranged  from  0.76  to  1.04  with  the  lower  limit  of  two  sided  95%  CI

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

being greater than 0.50 for all antigens. The lower limit of 95% CI for the difference (P MenACWY + Prevnar PPrevnar) in percentages of subjects achieving a concentration of ≥0.35 µg/mL was greater than -10% (Group 1 non-inferior to Group 2) for all of the pneumococcal antigens. For percentage of subjects with the stricter cut-off antibody concentration ≥1.0 µg/mL, the lower limit of 95% CI on the difference between groups after the toddler dose was greater than -10% (met non-inferiority criteria) for PnC antigens PnC 6B, PnC 14, PnC 18C, PnC 19F and PnC 23F.

## Safety results

Out of a total of 529 subjects enrolled in the study, 525 (99%) subjects were exposed to at least one study vaccination and provided safety data; these subjects were included in the safety analysis.

Safety  was  assessed  for  all  subjects  in  terms  of  the  frequency  and  percentage  of  subjects  with reported SAEs or medically attended AEs.

## CHMP's comments

Note that reactogenicity, local and systemic, was not solicited during the study.

During the infant series vaccination (2-7 months), the percentages of subjects with AEs were similar between the vaccination groups (72% in Group 1 and 70% in Group 2) with low rates (2% and &lt;1% subjects  in  the  respective  groups)  having  AEs  that  were  at  least  possibly  related  to  the  study vaccination. Between the third and fourth vaccination (7-12 months), the percentages of subjects with AEs were similar between the vaccination groups (75% in Group 1 and 74% in Group 2) with none of the  subjects  in  either  group  having  AEs  that  were  judged  to  be  related  to  the  study  vaccination. Twenty eight days after toddler dose at 12 months, the percentages of subjects with AEs were similar between the vaccination groups (36% in Group 1 and 35% in Group 2) with none of the subjects in either group having AEs that were judged to be related to the study vaccination.

## Adverse events

The  most  commonly  reported  AEs  by  preferred  term  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infections  (56% 57%,  similar  between  Group  1  and  Group  2)  followed  by  otitis  media  (39%  in  each  group), conjunctivitis  (23%  and  19%),  viral  infections  (15%  and  19%),  pyrexia  (17%  in  each  group), bronchiolitis (16% and 15%), gastroenteritis (15% and 12%), and dermatitis due to diaper (13% and 15%). None of these AEs was judged to be related to the study vaccination.

## Deaths, Serious adverse events and other significant adverse events

No deaths were reported in this study. 21 (8%) subjects in Group 1 and 20 (7%) subjects in Group 2 experienced  SAEs  with  none  of  the  SAEs  being  judged  to  be  related  to  the  study  vaccination.  Two subjects (Subject no. 28/0025 in Group 1 and Subject no. 28/0053 in Group 2) had seizures as SAEs. In the opinion of the investigator these SAEs were unrelated to the study vaccine.

Subject No. 28/0025: Febrile Seizure and Enteroviral Meningitis

This subject was vaccinated concomitantly with MenACWY, Pentacel Prevnar, and RotaTeq on 23 FEB 2010,  26  APR  2010  and  30  JUN  2010.  On  08  SEP  2010  (70  days  after  the  third  vaccination),  the subject suffered a new onset of seizure (assessed as non-serious AE by the investigator). On 13 SEP 2010 (75 days after the third vaccination), he was hospitalized after he experienced a fever of 103.4° F and a tonic-clonic seizure lasting 30 seconds. There were no further high fevers nor seizures noted during  the  hospitalization.  Neurological  exam  was  non-focal.  Cerebrospinal  fluid  was  positive  for enterovirus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The subject was diagnosed with enteroviral meningitis and possible febrile seizure, treated with acetaminophen and ibuprofen, and was discharged on 14 SEP 2010. The subject had fully recovered from the febrile seizure and enteroviral meningitis by 13 SEP 2010 and 16 SEP 2010, respectively. The study dropped out of the study as a result of the event.

Subject No. 28/0053: Seizure (non-febrile).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This subject was vaccinated with routine vaccinations Pentacel, Prevnar, RotaTeq on 30 MAR 2010, 01 JUN 2010, 03 AUG 2010, Engerix-B on 30 MAR 2010, 03 AUG 2010 and Prevnar and MMR II on 07 FEB 2011; Fluzone on 05 NOV 2010 and 07 MAR 2011, hepatitis B vaccine on 05 NOV 2010, hepatitis A vaccine on 07 MAR 2011, and varicella vaccine on 07 MAR 2011. Prior to study period, the subject was vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine on 03 FEB 2010.

The subject was in the control group and did not receive study vaccine. On 17 MAR 2011(39 days after the  fourth  vaccinations  with  Prevnar  and  MMR  II),  the  subject  experienced  a  viral  syndrome  and vomiting. The subject was treated with azithromycin and albuterol. On the same day, one hour after symptom onset, the subject experienced a seizure episode and was admitted to the hospital. Chest xray was normal. The subject was treated with levetiracetam. The subject recovered from the events on 19 MAR 2011. On 23 MAR 2011, upon discharge from hospital, the subject was noted to sustain an episode of 'eyes rolled back' for one minute duration. No further seizures were noted. The subject dropped out of the study as a result of the event.

## CHMP's comments

It is agreed with the MAH that these serious AEs are unlikely related to the study medication.

## III. Discussion on clinical aspects

The  MAH  submitted  the  clinical  study  reports  of  6  recently  completed  studies  involving  the  use  of MenACWY in the paediatric population, as per Article 46 of the European Paediatric Regulation (EC N0 1901/2006).  Of  these  6  paediatric  studies,  4  were  in  children  2  years  of  age  and  above  (studies V59\\_39,  V59\\_40,  V59\\_49,  and  V59\\_50)  and  2  in  children  &lt;  2  years  of  age  (studies  V59\\_33  and V59P14E1).

Thee  studies  evaluated  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of  MenACWY  in  different  age  group  for registrational purposes in Korea, Taiwan and Russia (V59P39, V59P49 and V59P50). The findings of these  studies  are  largely  in  line  with  those  of  studies  previously  submitted  by  the  MAH  to  support immunogenicity and safety of MenACWY in children aged 2 to 18 years of age. No safety concerns were identified  during the  studies.  The  frequencies  of  solicited  AEs  were  similar  to  those  previously reported in this age group.

Two studies  considered  the  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  MenACWY  and  routine  vaccines  following concomitant vaccination (V59P33, V59P40). The main findings of these studies are in line with findings from previous interaction studies with the same vaccines in similar age groups; namely that MenACWY can safely be given with routine vaccinations (pneumococcal, IPV, HBV, Hib, DTaP, Tdap). In Study V59P40  too the response to FHA  and  PRN  is significantly lower (albeit non-inferiority  was demonstrated)  when  Tdap  is  given  concomitantly  with  MenACWY,  confirming  earlier  findings  from study  V59P18.  This  information  is  already  reflected  in  section  4.5  of  the  SmPC,  i.e.  that  there  is evidence  to  suggest  negative  effect  of  concomitant  vaccination  with  MenACWY  and  HPV  on  the response to pertussis antigens FHA and PRN yet the clinical relevance is unknown.

For  study  V59P40  the  immunogenicity  analysis  for  the  second  primary  objective  (assessment  of immune response against HPV antigens) are yet to be presented in an addendum to the clinical study report as soon as results are available. The MAH should provide these results when available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Finally,  the  MAH  also  submitted the 60 months data from study V59P14Ee1 of which the 40 month data have been previously submitted. These data showed that antibody persistence is greater among subjects who received the 2 dose series compared to those who had received the 4-dose infant series This is likely attributable to the age at when the final dose was received or could reflect the maturity of the immune system at the time of priming. The low persistence for MenA seen in V59P14Ee1 is in line with  earlier  observations  in  other  studies  which  resulted  in  a  warning  in  the  SmPC.  Moreover,  an update of section 4.2 based upon further persistence data is currently being considered in variation II/42. Note that the MAH indicates that an increasing number of publications is suggesting that hSBA need not be an optimal assay for persistence assessment, especially for serogroup A. A discrepancy observed between the results with the rSBA (which shows good persistence for MenA) and hSBA assay (which shows poor persistence for MenA) could be attributable to known differences between assays due  to  differences  in  target  strain  susceptibilities  for  the  complement  sources  (Findlow  H,  2009, Poolman  JT,  2011).  This  would  merit  further  discussion  in  future  in  order  to  see  whether  the  poor persistence of antibodies as measured with the hSBA assay reflects a true decline in Abs. Importantly, the  response  to  vaccination  with  MenACWY  is  clearly  better  in  those  subjects  vaccinated  previously with MenACWY compared tot the Naive60 group pointing towards good priming for all serogroups.

With regards to the safety data from these 6 studies, these are largely in line with the known safety profile of MenACWY. The incidence of solicited AEs in different age groups is similar to that previously reported. No new safety concerns were identified. The  MAH  could  include  the  safety  data  from studies in children aged ≥2 years in section 4.8 to add to the body of evidence in support of the good safety profile of this vaccine. This could be done with a future type II variation.

## IV. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

It  is  agreed  with  the  MAH  that  the  data  submitted  does  not  change  the  benefit-risk  balance  of MenACWY, which remains positive.

The MAH has not proposed any changes to the Product Information which is largely agreed however, the MAH could include the safety data from studies in children aged ≥2 years in section 4.8 to add to the body of evidence in support of the good safety profile of this vaccine. This could be done with a future type II variation.

Secondly, it is advised that the MAH should provide the assessment of immune response against HPV antigens from study V59P40 when available.

## V. Overall conclusion
