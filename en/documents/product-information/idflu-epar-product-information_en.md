Influenza virus (inactivated, split) of the following strains*: A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 - like strain (A/California/7/2009, NYMC X-179A) Per 0.1 ml dose * propagated in fertilised hens' eggs from healthy chicken flocks ** haemagglutinin This vaccine complies with the WHO recommendations (Northern Hemisphere) and EU decision for the 2016/2017 season. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. IDflu may contain residues of eggs such as ovalbumin and residues of neomycin, formaldehyde and octoxinol 9, which are used during the manufacturing process (see section 4.3). 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension for injection. Colourless and opalescent suspension. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Prophylaxis of influenza in individuals 60 years of age and over, especially in those who run an increased risk of associated complications. The use of IDflu should be based on official recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Posology

Individuals 60 years of age and over: 0.1 ml.

Paediatric population

IDflu is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Method of administration

Immunisation should be carried out by intradermal route.

The recommended site of administration is the region of the deltoid.

Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product For instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

4.6

Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to any residues such as eggs (ovalbumin, chicken proteins), neomycin, formaldehyde and octoxinol 9. Immunisation shall be postponed in subjects with febrile illness or acute infection. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine (see section 4.8). IDflu should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. Very limited data in immunocompromised patients are available for IDflu. In case of presence of liquid at the injection site after vaccine administration, re-vaccination is not required. Interference with serological testing: See section 4.5. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction IDflu may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment. Following influenza vaccination, false positive results in serology tests using the ELISA method to detect antibodies against HIV1, Hepatitis C and especially HTLV1 have been observed. The Western Blot technique disproves the false-positive ELISA test results. The transient false positive reactions could be due to the IgM response by the vaccine. Fertility, pregnancy and lactation This vaccine is intended for individuals 60 years of age and over. Therefore, this information is not applicable. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

IDflu has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## a. Summary of the safety profile

The safety of IDflu has been assessed in 3 open-label randomised clinical trials, 3,372 vaccinees received an injection of IDflu.

Safety evaluation was performed for all subjects during the first 3 weeks following vaccination and serious adverse reactions were collected during six months of follow-up for 2,974 subjects (population of two out of the three clinical trials).

The most common reactions occurring after vaccine administration were local reactions at injection site. Apparent local reactions after intradermal administration were more frequent than after intramuscular administration of an adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted comparator vaccine. Most reactions resolved spontaneously within 1 to 3 days after onset. Systemic safety profile of IDflu is similar to the comparator vaccine, adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted, administered intramuscularly. After repetitive yearly injections the safety profile of IDflu is similar to the previous injections. b. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions The data below summarizes the frequencies of the adverse reactions that were recorded following vaccination during clinical trials and worldwide post-marketing experience, using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data).

Across all three influenza strains, for the comparator intramuscular vaccine GMTs ranged between 34.8 (1/dil) and 181.0 (1/dil), seroprotection rates ranged between 48.9% and 87.9%, seroconversion or significant increase rates ranged between 30.0% and 46.9% and GMTRs ranged between 3.04 and 5.35-fold over baseline HI titres.

Immunogenicity Seroprotection is generally obtained within 2 to 3 weeks. The duration of postvaccinal immunity to homologous strains or to strains closely related to the vaccine strains varies but is usually 6-12 months. In a pivotal randomised comparative phase III trial, 2,606 subjects over 60 years of age received 0.1 ml of IDflu by intradermal route and 1,089 subjects over 60 years of age received 0.5 ml of a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine administered by intramuscular route. In this comparative trial the geometric mean titres (GMTs), seroprotection rate*, seroconversion or significant increase rate** and the geometric mean titre ratio (GMTR) for anti-HA antibody (measured by HI) were assessed according to predefined criteria. Data were as follows (values in brackets show the 95% confidence intervals): * Seroprotection = HI titre ≥ 40 ** Seroconversion = negative pre-vaccination HI titre and post vaccination HI titre ≥ 40, Significant increase = positive pre-vaccination HI titre and at least a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination HI titre GMTR: Geometric mean titre ratio of individual (post-/pre-vaccination titre). IDflu is at least as immunogenic as the comparator trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine administered by intramuscular route for each of the 3 influenza strains in subjects from 60 years of age and over. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In a randomised comparative phase III trial, 398 subjects over 65 years of age received 0.1 ml of IDflu by intradermal route and 397 subjects over 65 years of age received 0.5 ml of a trivalent inactivated adjuvanted (MF-59 containing) influenza vaccine at the same dosage administered by intramuscular route.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

IDflu is as immunogenic as the comparator trivalent adjuvanted (MF-59 containing) vaccine in terms of GMT for each of the 3 influenza strains with the SRH method and for 2 strains with the HI method.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Not applicable

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

<!-- image -->

Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on animal studies. The vaccine was immunogenic in mice and rabbits. In repeated-dose toxicity studies in rabbits there was no significant evidence of systemic toxicity. Nevertheless, single and repeated administrations led to transient local erythema and oedema. Genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential were not assessed because these studies are not appropriate for a vaccine. Fertility and toxicity studies to reproduction in females have not identified any specific potential hazard for humans. 6.

<!-- image -->

## 2/ HOLD MICRO-INJECTION SYSTEM BETWEEN THUMB &amp; MIDDLE FINGER

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Remove the needle cap from the Micro-Injection System. Do not purge air through the needle. Hold the system by placing the thumb and middle finger only on the finger pads; the index finger remains free. Do not place fingers on the windows. 3/ INSERT NEEDLE RAPIDLY PERPENDICULAR TO THE SKIN 4/ INJECT USING THE INDEX FINGER Insert the needle perpendicular to the skin, in the region of the deltoid, in a short, quick movement. Once the micro-needle has been inserted, maintain a light pressure on the surface of the skin and inject using the index finger to push on the plunger. The vein test is unnecessary. 5/ ACTIVATE NEEDLE SHIELD BY PUSHING FIRMLY ON PLUNGER Remove the needle from the skin. Orient the needle away from you and others. With the same hand, push very firmly with the thumb on the plunger to activate the needle shield. You hear a click and a shield comes out to cover the needle. Immediately dispose of the system in the nearest sharps collector. Injection is considered successful whether or not the presence of a wheal is observed. In case of presence of liquid at the injection site after vaccine administration, revaccination is not required. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2/ HOLD MICRO-INJECTION SYSTEM BETWEEN THUMB &amp; MIDDLE FINGER

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Remove the needle cap from the Micro-Injection System. Do not purge air through the needle. Hold the system by placing the thumb and middle finger only on the finger pads; the index finger remains free. Do not place fingers on the windows. 3/ INSERT NEEDLE RAPIDLY PERPENDICULAR TO THE SKIN 4/ INJECT USING THE INDEX FINGER Insert the needle perpendicular to the skin, in the region of the deltoid, in a short, quick movement. Once the micro-needle has been inserted, maintain a light pressure on the surface of the skin and inject using the index finger to push on the plunger. The vein test is unnecessary. 5/ ACTIVATE NEEDLE SHIELD BY PUSHING FIRMLY ON PLUNGER Remove the needle from the skin. Orient the needle away from you and others. With the same hand, push very firmly with the thumb on the  plunger to activate the needle shield. You hear a click and a shield comes out to cover the needle. Immediately dispose of the system in the nearest sharps collector. Injection is considered successful whether or not the presence of a wheal is observed. In case of presence of liquid at the injection site after vaccine administration, revaccination is not required. See also section 3. HOW TO USE IDflu Medicinal product no longer authorised
