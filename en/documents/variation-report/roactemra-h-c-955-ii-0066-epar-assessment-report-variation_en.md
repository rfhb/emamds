## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Roche Registration Limited submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 17 November 2016 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I, II and III      |

Extension of indication to include treatment of giant cell arteritis in adult patients for the subcutaneous formulation of RoActemra based on the Phase III study WA28119 (GiACTA). As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated to reflect information relevant to this indication. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling,  Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision (P/0266/2015) on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP (P/0266/2015) was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 16 February 2012. The Scientific Advice pertained to clinical aspects of the dossier.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a recombinant humanised anti-human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) that binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6R, thereby inhibiting IL-6-mediated signalling.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Interleukin 6 (IL-6), the ligand of IL-6R, is a cytokine produced by a wide variety of cells in the human body. Its normal role is primarily to regulate haematopoiesis, to stimulate immune responses, and to mediate acute phase reactions. Consequently, excessive production of IL-6 can be implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases involved with these functions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple myeloma and Castleman's Disease. IL-6 exerts its biological effects through both the membrane bound IL-6 receptor (mIL-6R),  and  the  soluble  form  of  the  receptor  (sIL-6R).  TCZ  binds  specifically  to  both  soluble  and membrane-bound  IL-6  receptors  (sIL-6R  and  mIL-6R),  and  has  been  shown  to  inhibit  sIL-6R  and mIL-6R-mediated signaling. TCZ has been shown to inhibit the biological activities of IL-6 in vitro and in vivo and to suppress the development of arthritis and C-reactive protein synthesis in a collagen induced arthritis model in cynomolgus monkey.

TCZ is available in 2 different pharmaceutical forms to allow either administration by intravenous (IV) infusion or by subcutaneous (SC) injection.

In  the  European  Union  (EU)  both  pharmaceutical  forms  of  TCZ  are  approved,  in  combination  with methotrexate (MTX), for the treatment of severe, active and progressive RA, in adults not previously treated with MTX and for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have either responded inadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.

In these patients, TCZ can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate.

The recommended dose for IV administration is 8 mg/kg TCZ every 4 weeks (q4w).

For SC administration, the recommended dose is 162 mg once every week (qw).

The IV formulation of TCZ is also approved in the EU, at the recommended dose, for the treatment of active systemic  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (sJIA)  in  patients  2  years  of  age  and  older,  who  have  responded inadequately to previous therapy with NSAIDs and systemic corticosteroids. RoActemra can be given as monotherapy (in case of intolerance to MTX or where treatment with MTX is inappropriate) or in combination with MTX.

Also, RoActemra in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic polyarthritis (pJIA; rheumatoid factor positive or negative and extended oligoarthritis) in patients 2 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with MTX. RoActemra can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate.

## Background on disease

Giant  cell  arteritis  (GCA  or  temporal  arteritis)  is  a  systemic  inflammatory  vasculitis  of  medium-  and large-size arteries. The inflammatory process typically involves the extracranial branches of the carotid arteries, but also affects the aorta, aortic arch and its branches. The disease typically occurs in the White population and in individuals older than 50 years of age and was once considered primarily a cranial disease with new onset headaches regarded as the prototypical symptom. However non-cranial manifestations such as polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) symptoms and limb claudication are other important features. Giant cell arteritis can manifest with ischemic events due to vessel occlusion, most typically central retinal artery occlusion  or  anterior  ischemic  optic  neuropathy  which  both  lead  to  irreversible  vision  loss,  and  less frequently,  subclavian  artery  occlusion  leading  to  symptomatic  ischemic  issues  affecting  the  upper extremities. Ischemic events are most frequent early in the disease course and often occur before the initiation  of  treatment.  Less  well  characterized  are  the  long-term  effects  of  GCA,  which  include  aortic aneurysm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Glucocorticoids (GC) are the mainstay of treatment for GCA and are typically administered in the form of oral prednisone/prednisolone, although some physicians use pulsed intravenous (IV) glucocorticoids in patients presenting with visual loss. Although glucocorticoids are highly effective at inducing remission of systemic inflammation and preventing acute damage (e.g., blindness), this comes with a high toxicity burden, with approximately 80% of patients suffering GC-related adverse clinical events at 10-year follow-up (Proven et al. 2003). In addition, GC are not as effective at maintaining remission, with many patients (up to 50%) experiencing relapse or flare-up of symptoms during reduction or discontinuation of glucocorticoids (Proven et al. 2003). Other agents, including azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate (MTX), infliximab, and etanercept, have shown conflicting or no evidence of benefit in the treatment of GCA. In spite of the paucity of evidence, MTX is used inconsistently as standard of care for glucocorticoid-sparing in relapsing patients. More recently, limited efficacy in the treatment of GCA has been demonstrated with the use of combination treatment with abatacept and prednisone (Langford et al. 2015).

## Development aspects

Data to support the efficacy of tocilizumab (also known as RO4877533 and TCZ) in adult patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA or temporal arteritis) are provided from the pivotal Phase III trial (Study WA28119; GiACTA). Study WA28119 was designed to evaluate the efficacy of TCZ plus glucocorticoid treatment compared to treatment with glucocorticoids alone in new-onset and relapsing patients with GCA, as well as to evaluate the safety profile of TCZ treatment in this patient population. The study includes a 52-week blinded period (Part 1) followed by a 104-week open-label period (Part 2), with a total study duration of 156 weeks. Clinical conduct of Part 1 of the study is complete and the primary analysis has been conducted. The Part 2, open-label extension/long-term follow-up, is currently ongoing. The purpose of the open-label extension/long-term follow-up is to describe the long-term safety and maintenance of efficacy after 52 weeks of therapy with TCZ in GCA, to explore the rate of relapse and the requirement for TCZ therapy beyond 52 weeks, and to gain insight into the potential long-term steroid-sparing effect with TCZ.

Additionally, in order to support data from Study WA28119, efficacy data are provided from the publication by Villiger et al. 2016 which describes a Phase II investigator-initiated study (further referred to as Study ML25676 throughout this report) designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCZ + glucocorticoid treatment compared to glucocorticoid treatment alone in the induction and maintenance of disease remission in patients with new-onset and relapsing GCA.

In addition to the safety data derived from the above studies, the safety database is enriched by pooled long-term safety data with IV TCZ in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population, referred to as LTE All-exposure RA population.

Scientific Advice was sought from the CHMP.

| CHMP Scientific Advice (Feb 2012) | Overall study design                | CHMP agreed with the overall study design (incl. the sustained remission endpoint, the inclusion of new- onset and relapsing patients, and the general glucocorticoid tapering schedule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| CHMP Scientific Advice (Feb 2012) | Patient selection criteria          | CHMP noted that the inclusion criteria into WA28119 differ from the ACR criteria. The planned inclusion criteria allow also a diagnosis by positive imaging. The CHMP expects a validation of the utility of imaging as a diagnostic criterion. Furthermore, it was suggested to have the locally evaluated TAB slides re-read by a central facility since GCA diagnosis takes place before the patients enter the study. Action taken: the Sponsor evaluated the possibility to collect the slides from the local laboratonies to enable a confirmatory central reading as a quality assessment. However, it was determined that a retrospective collection of the slides was not feasible due to logistical and operational difficulties, in particular because the biopsies were not directly part of the planned assessments during the WA28119 study. |
| CHMP Scientific Advice (Feb 2012) | Definition of \"refractory\" patients | CHMP noted a lack of clarity whether “refractory disease\" referred to patients for whom remission could not be achieved below a certain glucocorticoid dose or whether this included also patients who could not achieve remission at any glucocorticoid dose. Action taken: Definition of refractory (relapsing) patients was updated to include those who have active disease despite at least two consecutive weeks of treatment with ≥40 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) at any time in the amended protocol version 3 (see Table 2).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| CHMP Scientific Advice (Feb 2012) | Size of safety database             | The size of the safety database with 150 TCZ-treated GCA patients was in general considered adequate. However, it was noted that this patient population was older than RA patients and could thus be more vulnerable and may have an increased risk of infections. Action taken: The submission dossier contains analyses of safety of TCZ in RA patients as well as analyses of real world data in GCA patients not treated with TCZ to determine the background rates for relevant safety parameters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Only data from Part 1 of the study is presented. Part 2 of the study is currently ongoing and will be presented separately. The final CSR will be submitted in Q1 2019.

Comparisons were made between the two dosing regimens and to findings in the RA population. Additionally, a population pharmacokinetics analysis was performed to describe the PK characteristics of TCZ in patients with GCA following multiple SC administrations of TCZ and to investigate the potential effect of selected covariates on the PK parameters.

## Study WA28119 - PK results

A secondary objective of the study was to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of TCZ in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper regimen in patients with GCA. During the 52-week double-blind period of the study (Part 1), study drug (TCZ or placebo) was supplied in 1-mL, ready-to-use, single-use PFS, each delivering either 162 mg (0.9 mL) of TCZ solution or matching placebo (SC administration).

For assessment of serum TCZ concentrations, IL-6, and sIL-6R levels, pre-dose samples were collected in all patients at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 16, 24, 36, 48, and 52. A sample was also drawn at early withdrawal and Week 8 follow-up (except IL-6).

In addition, approximately 35 patients participated in a pharmacokinetic substudy. In these patients, additional PK samples for assessment of serum TCZ concentrations were drawn at 24, 48, 72 96, and 120 or 144 hours following the first dose and following dose at Week 16, and pre-dose at Weeks 17 and 18.

Note: All ssmples will be obtained according to the prooedures in the Sample Handing and Logisties Manual for anslysis of TCz.

* Patlents should be encouraged to provide PK samples on elther Day 5 or 0 of the week for baseline assessments and either Day 117 or 118 for Week 16 assessments. Iif the patlent ls not svailable on elther day. this will not be consldered a protocol deviatlon.
- Patlents will receive SC Injections at baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 16, 17, and 18 in the clinie to ensure the dosing time is recorded accurately.
- These are the same samples obtained from all patients in Appendix 1. No duplicale samples for patients participating in the PK substudy are necessary.
- The PK sample should be collected prior to the TCZ administration at baseline and at Weeks 1. 2. 16, 17, and 18. Patients must not inject TCZ at home before PK sample collection at the site.

In total, the data set comprised 1263 serum TCZ concentrations from a total of 149 GCA patients treated with TCZ. Patients were treated with placebo or TCZ 162 mg, QW or Q2W SC for 52 weeks.

Mean pre-dose TCZ concentrations increased with repeated dosing from baseline to Week 16 and appeared to reach steady state thereafter (Figure below). An approximate 6-fold and 2-fold accumulation in mean TCZ Ctrough at steady state was observed for patients in the QW and Q2W groups, respectively. Based on observed data for all patients, the steady-state Ctrough values were 67.93±34.40 µg/mL and 12.22±10.02 µg/mL in the SC QW group and Q2W group, respectively. The large increase in exposure between QW dosing and Q2W dosing is consistent with the known effect of concentration-dependent elimination of TCZ. The nonlinear elimination pathway of TCZ is believed to represent a target-mediated clearance process due to the binding to soluble and membrane bound IL-6R receptors.

## Study Population

Mean (range) weight and body surface area of the patients in this study was 70.3 kg (46.4 to 124 kg) and 1.76 m2 (1.34 to 2.25 m2), respectively. Mean (range) age was 69.4 years (51 to 91 years). The dataset contained the data from 37 (24.8%) male and 112 (75.2%) female patients; 100 (67.1%) patients received TCZ QW doses and 49 (32.9%) of patients received TCZ Q2W doses. The majority of patients were Caucasians (96.0%) and non-Hispanic (94.6%). Most of the doses (76.8%) were injected to the abdominal wall, with 19.2% of doses injected to the thigh, and 4% injected to the arm.

To assess whether there was an exposure body-weight effect, a scatter plot of observed Ctrough at Week 52 versus body weight was displayed resulting from study WA28119:

<!-- image -->

There was a positive trend for higher exposure in patients with lower body weight. The associated Pearson's correlation coefficient (R) was -0.504 and -0.404 for the QW and Q2W regimens, respectively, which indicates a moderate inverse correlation between Ctrough and body weight.

The relationship between exposure and body weight as well as other body size parameters (such as body surface area) following SC administration of TCZ is discussed further in the popPK results.

To evaluate whether there was a difference in exposure between responders versus non-responders, the average Ctrough at Week 52 was compared: In the TCZ QW group, the mean±SD TCZ concentrations at Week 52 in responders vs. non-responders were 69.2±35 µg/mL and 64.9±33.5 µg/mL, respectively. In the TCZ Q2W group, the mean ± SD TCZ concentrations were 13.3±10.4 µg/mL and 9.0±8.4 µg/mL, respectively. There was a slight but consistent trend, notably in the Q2W regimen, toward higher Ctrough values in responders compared with non-responders; however, the differences were small considering the variability in the data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

The PD of TCZ was characterized by assessing two mechanistic markers of activity: soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and interleukin-6 (IL6) levels and two markers of inflammation: C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).

The time course of markers of TCZ mechanism-related activity (IL-6 and sIL-6R) and PD markers of inflammation (CRP and ESR) were not statistically different between the two treatment groups. However, there was a trend for a slightly higher increase (sIL-6R) or reductions (IL-6) in the PD parameters following QW regimen, consistent with higher Ctrough. CRP and ESR levels in both TCZ groups were markedly reduced relative to placebo with no notable difference between the dosed groups.

## sIL-6R

The profiles of pre-dose serum sIL-6R concentrations over nominal time are displayed in the Figure below:

Figure 2 - Mean ± SD soluble IL-6R Levels by Visit (TCZ QW, Q2W, PBO + 26 Week, PBO + 52 Week - Study WA28119)

<!-- image -->

Levels of sIL-6R steadily increased after the first dose, reaching a plateau around Week 16. At Week 52, the sIL-6R levels (mean ± SD) were higher by 29% in the TCZ QW group (600.5±217.5 ng/mL) as compared to the TCZ Q2W group (464.3±153.6 ng/mL). The sIL-6R responses to TCZ treatment in both regimens are comparable to the mean levels in RA patients at steady state (Week 24) who received the same dose regimens (599±180.1 ng/mL for TCZ QW in study WA22762 and 449±217.8 ng/mL for TCZ Q2W in study NA25220). Levels of sIL-6R in the placebo groups during the 52 weeks of study essentially remained unchanged from baseline.

## IL-6

The mean ± SD pre-dose levels of IL-6 increased rapidly to 125.86±158.64 pg/mL one week after the first dose in the TCZ QW group, and subsequently plateaued to 65.99±84.92 pg/mL by Week 52 (Figure below). Similarly, the mean IL-6 levels in the TCZ Q2W group increased rapidly one week after the first dose (142.72±356.67 pg/mL), and then decreased to 42.62±47.87 pg/mL at Week 2, corresponding with decreased TCZ concentration at the end of the first dosing interval. Mean IL-6 levels in TCA Q2W group subsequently increased to 66.20±47.11 pg/mL at Week 3 and plateaued out until Week 52 (52.70±33.10 pg/mL). At Week 52, the IL-6 levels were higher (25%) in the TCZ QW group compared to the TCZ Q2W

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

group. Levels of IL-6 in the placebo groups during the 52 weeks of study essentially remained unchanged from baseline.

Figure 3 - Mean ± SD IL-6 Concentrations by Visit (TCZ QW, Q2W, PBO + 26 Week, PBO + 52 Week - Study WA28119)

<!-- image -->

The mean values of CRP and ESR (see Figures below) decreased rapidly in both the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W groups, and remained low throughout the study.

Mean ± SD levels of CRP at Week 52 were 1.42±4.30 and 0.83±1.60 mg/L for the QW and Q2W regimens, respectively. Mean ± SD levels of ESR at Week 52 were 4.84±4.04 and 7.06±6.79 mm/h for the QW and Q2W regimens, respectively. CRP and ESR levels at baseline for all patients were close to the upper end of the normal range (8 mg/L) in healthy individuals. This is in contrast to the baseline acute phase reactants observed in RA patients, in which the majority had elevated CRP and ESR at baseline, and could be due to the fact that the GCA patients were already receiving high dose glucocorticoids at study entry, which suppresses the acute phase reactants. During the 52 weeks of study, the mean CRP and ESR levels in the placebo groups essentially remained unchanged relative to their baseline levels.

## Immunogenicity results

Pre-dose TCZ concentrations were evaluated for the 4 patients who were negative for ADAs at baseline but developed positive post-baseline anti-TCZ antibodies following initiation of treatment: 1 in the TCZ QW (1.1%) and 3 in the TCZ Q2W (6.5%) group. All ADAs were transient, and each occurred only at a single time point over the 52 week dosing period. As shown in the Figure below, patient 10221 in the QW group and patient 10862 in the Q2W group did not show any trend for decreased TCZ concentration at Week 24 and 32 when their ADA test showed positive results and concentrations were similar to or at the high end of observed values among all patients on this regimen. In contrast, patients 10227 and 10628 (both in the TCZ Q2W group) showed a transient decrease at Week 24 when their ADA test showed positive results and had observed concentration-time courses which were in the lower range of all exposures in the group. None of the patients, who developed treatment-induced ADA, experienced any anaphylaxis, serious and/or clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, injection site reactions, or withdrew due to lack of efficacy.

## 2.3.4. PK/PD modelling

## Population PK Modelling and Analysis

The data set comprised 1263 serum TCZ concentrations from a total of 149 GCA patients treated with TCZ over 52 weeks. Patients were treated with placebo or TCZ 162 mg, QW or Q2W SC for 52 weeks.

A two-compartment PK model with first-order absorption (following SC administration) and parallel linear and Michaelis-Menten (non-linear) eliminations was previously developed for adult RA patients (Model 317). The compartmental models were parameterized in terms of CL(s) and volume(s) of distribution, Q, Vp, Vmax, the Michaelis-Menten constant (KM), Ka, and Fsc. Fsc was fixed to the value obtained from adult RA patients, since there was no IV data available for GCA patients. Inter-subject variability was incorporated on linear CL, Q, Vc, Vp, and Ka.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The final population PK parameter estimates for GCA patients (Model 107) and predicted covariate effects are listed in the Tables below. All structural and covariate effect parameters were estimated precisely (RSE 5% - 22%). The RSE values of the random effect variance parameters were in the range of 17% - 27%, with the exception of the random effect on the peripheral volume that was poorly estimated.

Shrinkage of the random effects was low to moderate (2% - 27%) with the exception of the random effect on the peripheral volume (with shrinkage of 48.9%).

The values of the continuous covariates represent 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the values in the analysis data set.

Based on prior knowledge from the previous population PK analysis for adult RA patients, the population PK model contained the following covariates: body weight on linear CL, inter-compartmental CL (Q), and volume of distribution of the central (Vc) and peripheral (Vp) compartments; age on absorption rate constant (Ka); thigh injection site on SC bioavailability (Fsc); HDL on CL; serum albumin and total protein on Vc and Vp; and creatinine CL on maximum elimination rate (Vmax). This model was the starting point of the analysis. The model was evaluated and refined using the data collected from GCA patients (Study WA28119).

The significant covariates identified for GCA patients were: body weight on linear CL, Q, Vc, and Vp; age on Ka, and injection in the thigh on Fsc. The data set included relatively narrow range of ages (51 to 91 years), which leads to a high relative standard error estimated for the age effect on Ka. Therefore, age effect on Ka was fixed to be equal to the value in the adult RA model.

Other covariates previously identified for adult RA patients were: HDL on CL; serum albumin and total protein on Vc and Vp, and creatinine CL on Vmax. These covariates were tested in the current model for GCA patients; none of them were significant, and they were removed from the model. Additionally, the presence of ADA was not found to influence the PK of TCZ.

Body weight is the main covariate which has an appreciable impact on the PK of TCZ, and the relationships of the individual PK parameters with body weight are shown in the Figure below.

Renal impairment is not anticipated to impact the PK of TCZ and as anticipated creatinine CL was not identified as a significant covariate in the model. Based on the slightly older population with this disease one-third of the patients in the trial had moderate renal impairment; no significant impact on TCZ exposure was noted in these patients.

Covariate effects identified in adult RA patients were reevaluated and non-significant effects were removed. Additional covariate effects were tested and discarded as they did not improve the fit. Distributions of the random effects for patients with and without detected ADAs were compared and the effects of ADAs were tested as time-dependent covariates on linear and Michaelis- Menten clearances.

Predicted individual exposure parameters at steady-state are summarized in the Table below. Steady-state Cmean value for the QW regimen (71.3 μg/mL) was about 4.4 times higher than for the Q2W regimen (16.2 μg/mL), Cmax value for the QW regimen (73.0 μg/mL) were 3.8 times higher than for the Q2W regimen (19.3 μg/mL), while Ctrough values for the QW regimen (68.1 μg/mL) was 6.1 times higher than for the Q2W regimen (11.1 μg/mL).

## Exposure efficacy analysis

Exposure-efficacy relationship of TCZ in GCA patients was described by exposure tertiles (week 52) and graphical analyses for PD and efficacy marker sIL-6R, CRP, and ESR as well for some secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints (cumulative glucocorticoid dose and annualized relapse rate up to Week 52). The distribution of Ctrough values reached by week 52 is depicted in the Figure below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 8 - Distribution of Ctrough values reached by week 52

<!-- image -->

sIL-6R levels increased with time and with increasing exposure; CRP and ESR decreased with time and with increasing exposure and remained at low levels in all exposure categories; the biggest difference in the PD markers noted between the 1st tertile and upper two tertiles; the between-subject variability observed in sIL-6R, CRP and ESR levels decreased slightly with increasing exposure.

<!-- image -->

Tertile analysis showed that primary efficacy endpoints (sustained remission up to Week 52) were similar in all TCZ exposure categories with a small, but not statistically significant trend of increasing efficacy with exposure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tertile analysis regarding secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints (cumulative glucocorticoid dose and annualized relapse rate up to Week 52) showed overall similarity in all TCZ exposure categories.

To characterize the relationship between TCZ exposure and time to first flare in patients with GCA a Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used. The following covariates were included in the analysis: demography (body weight, age, gender, smoking status [yes, no]), baseline disease status [new onset, relapsed] and TCZ exposure (treatment effect [TCZ, placebo], Cave8). The individual predicted average concentration up to Week 8 from treatment start (Cave8) was used as a surrogate for exposure.

A nonlinear Emax model was applied to characterize the effect of concentration (Cave8). The Cox proportional-hazards analysis identified TCZ exposure and gender as the only two covariates which were significant predictors for the risk of flare.

Risk of flare for males was ~3 times lower compared to females (HR = 0.320). The reference for the effect of TCZ exposure is Cave8=3.346 μg/mL (=EC50 value).

Results showed that patients in the QW group achieved a range of exposures which provided the maximal possible benefit. Patients in the 1st tertile in the Q2W group were at a higher risk for an earlier time to flare. Gender was also identified as a statistically significant predictor for the risk of flare with females identified as being at a higher risk. This finding may be influenced by the fact that 75% of the study participants were female due to a higher prevalence of GCA in females. No other prognostic factors had a significant effect on the risk of flare in GCA patients.

## Exposure safety analysis

Graphical analyses to describe the exposure-safety relationships for SC administration of TCZ in patients with GCA were provided.

Consistent with the previous body of data in RA, there was no apparent association of TCZ concentrations or exposure with the occurrence of any SAEs, or AEs in system organ class (SOC) 'Infections and Infestations' or SOC \"Gastrointestinal disorders\".

The only detected signal was a slightly higher percentage of Grade 3+ AEs in the QW treatment arm (14%, 9%, and 2% for SAEs, II AEs, and GI AEs respectively versus 8.2%, 6.1%, and 0% for the respective AEs in the Q2W treatment arm), but the number of events were too low to make any conclusions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There was a trend of greater decline of hematology parameters (white blood cells, neutrophils, and platelets) with increasing exposure, which reached a plateau at higher exposure levels for white blood cell and neutrophil counts.

<!-- image -->

There was no association of TCZ concentrations with the occurrence of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.

The following safety laboratory parameters were investigated: white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, platelet counts, total bilirubin, ALT, AST, serum albumin, total protein, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. Platelet counts time course was similar for all tertiles. Most biochemistry parameters (total bilirubin, ALT, AST, total protein, and total cholesterol) did not change during treatment. Small increases in serum albumin and LDL-cholesterol in the TCZ treatment groups were not associated with exposure. The increase in serum albumin over time was not dependent on TCZ exposure, and the albumin levels stayed below the upper limit of normal value for all exposure categories. Slight increases of LDL-cholesterol in the TCZ treatment groups appeared to have some dependence on TCZ exposure. However an examination of median changes from baseline (increase) in the three tertiles (0.27, 0.68 and 0.445 mg/dL, respectively) did not support this.

## 2.3.5. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

PK and PD of TCZ in GCA patients were assessed based on Part 1 of Phase III Study WA28119. 149 patients received 162 mg of TCZ SC QW (N=100) or Q2W (N=49). Limited information on Part 2 of Study WA28119 is included in the submission; the final report is awaited and will be provided by Q1 2019. A phase II study (ML25676) was conducted where TCZ has been administered intravenously. Results will be provided for further analyses regarding PK characterization and comparison with RA patients. Analyses integrating IV PK results should in particular focus on a more precise description of clearance and bioavailability.

## Comparison of PK and PD outcomes in the GCA population relative to RA

Data from both RA and GCA populations were fitted using the same structural model which was a two-compartment PK model with parallel linear and Michaelis-Menten elimination with first-order absorption for SC administration. The model for TCZ PK in RA was the starting point for the GCA population.

In both populations, the QW regimen resulted in nearly complete target saturation at steady-state during the entire dosing interval. The contribution of nonlinear CL to total CL was small at this dose.

In both populations, the target-mediated elimination pathway was not saturated during the entire dosing interval for the Q2W regimen which led to high total CL and high fluctuation of CL over dosing interval. The nonlinear CL led to a more than dose-proportional increase in steady state concentration for the QW regimen compared to the Q2W regimen.

In both populations, the PK parameters of TCZ following SC administration were not time-dependent as TCZ exposure was stable after achieving steady state.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

TCZ steady-state Ctrough values in GCA patients were 67.9±34.4 µg/mL and 12.2±10 µg/mL in the SC QW and Q2W group, respectively. Both mean steady state levels are slightly higher than observed in RA patients applying the same dose regimen (45 µg/mL and 5.9 µg/mL, respectively in RA patients).

Accumulation was much higher in the QW regimen which is plausible. CHMP agreed that the large increase in exposure between QW dosing and Q2W dosing is consistent with the known non-linear PK behaviour of TCZ.

BW influence on Ctrough exposure levels in GCA patients revealed a trend of higher Ctrough levels in lighter patients which is consistent with the use of a flat dose and with previous observations in RA patients. However, this impact was notably higher compared to RA patients. As the body weight ranges are comparative among both patient groups, body weight cannot be considered as reason for this notable difference in exposure between RA and GCA patients. The slightly higher levels observed in responder vs non-responder is not large enough to explain possible differences between GCA and RA.

Estimate of linear CL in GCA patients was slightly lower (approximately 30%) than in the RA population resulting in a higher exposure. This led to differences in the estimated half-life of TCZ and time to steady state in the two populations For example, the effective half-life at steady-state ranged from 12.1 to 13.0 days for the QW regimen in RA relative to 17.6 to 18.5 days for the same dose in GCA. After multiple dosing with the QW regimen, steady-state for AUC and Ctrough was achieved after the 12th injection in the RA population relative to the 16th injection in GCA.

In conclusion, a difference between the two populations was seen both on linear apparent CL and on the effect of body weight on linear apparent CL (see figure below). GCA patients appear to have a lower linear apparent CL than RA; the reason for the difference is unknown.

The resultant impact of differences in linear apparent CL and KM in the two models results in a 50% difference between the predicted steady state exposures in the two populations. These differences are clearly stated in the SmPC Section 5.2 accordingly. These differences occur due to unknown reasons. PK differences are not accompanied by marked differences in PD parameters and so the clinical relevance is unknown.

Age might be a potential factor considering that in the study WA28119 in patients were about 15 years older than the previous RA studies, in this study the mean (range) age was 69.4 years (51 to 91 years). But none of the POP-PK models applied so far identified age as a significant variable.

GCA=Giant cell arteritis; N=number of patients; QW =once a week; Q2W =once in every 2 weeks;RA=Rheumatoid arthritis;SC=subcutaneous;SD=standard deviation

Note: Concentrations of reference patient with RA and with GCA following TCZ QW and Q2W regimens were simulated using the RA SC model and the final model GCA model. Inter-subjectandresidualvariabilitywerenot included.Nocovariateeffectswereincluded.

Despite the difference in PK, the post-dose sIL-6R levels were similar in the two populations indicating similarity in the contribution of the target mediated clearance in the two populations.

The sIL-6R responses to both QW and Q2W TCZ regimens are comparable to the mean levels in the same regimens in RA patients. In the RA study WA22762, sIL-6R levels in the QW regimen at steady state (Week 24) were 648 ± 189.3 ng/mL [n = 557] compared to 600.53 ± 217.52 ng/mL in the GCA study, WA28119. Similarly for the Q2W regimen sIL-6R levels were 449 ± 217.8 ng/mL [n = 346] in the RA study NA25220 relative to 464.30 ± 153.64 ng/mL in the GCA study, WA28119. Thus, post-dose sIL-6R levels were similar indicating similarity in the contribution of the target mediated CL in the two populations. Time courses of the PD biomarkers sIL-6R and IL-6 are in line with the expectations.

ADA incidence was low in both groups (1-6 %) which is comparable to the incidence previously observed in other populations. Given the low number of patients with positive treatment emerging ADA and the mixed influence on PK, CHMP concluded that there is no consistent impact of positive post-baseline anti-TCZ antibodies on PK, safety or efficacy of TCZ.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Population PK analysis

The data set comprised 1263 serum TCZ concentrations from a total of 149 GCA patients treated with TCZ over 52 weeks. Patients were treated with placebo or TCZ 162 mg, QW or Q2W SC for 52 weeks.

A 2-compartmental model that was previously established for RA patients (Model 317) was selected as basis to describe the PK of TCZ following multiple SC administration in GCA patients.

Typical PK parameters have been estimated (Model 107) and are in the range of typical values for a monoclonal antibody (CL: 0.16 L/day, Vc: 4.09 L, Vp: 3.37 L).

The significant covariates identified for GCA patients were: body weight on linear CL, Q, Vc, and Vp; age on Ka, and injection in the thigh on Fsc. The data set included relatively narrow range of ages (51 to 91 years), which leads to a high relative standard error estimated for the age effect on Ka. Therefore, age effect on Ka was fixed to be equal to the value in the adult RA model.

The parameter estimates were also in a good agreement with the prior model except for the parameter KM that was estimated to be higher for GCA patients (0.705 μg/mL in the current analysis versus 0.343 μg/mL estimated for adult RA patients). As indicated above, GCA patients appear to have a lower linear apparent clearance compared to RA patients.

Post hoc simulation of Ctrough exposure showed comparable mean concentration time profiles over 52 weeks compared to the observed values, which was also demonstrated by prognostic and VPC plots.

Body weight is the main covariate which has an appreciable impact on the PK of TCZ (Cl, V).

This impact was notably higher compared to RA patients. CL and Vc for patients weighting 48.6 kg (2.5th percentile of the weight distribution in the dataset) decreased respectively by 34% and 22% compared to a 70 kg patient. CL and Vc for patients weighting 102 kg (97.5th percentile of the weight distribution in the dataset) increased respectively by 54% and 29% compared to a 70 kg patient.

As the body weight ranges are comparative among both patient groups, body weight cannot be considered as reason for this notable difference in exposure between RA and GCA patients. The slightly higher levels observed in responder vs non-responder is not large enough to explain possible differences between GCA and RA.

## Exposure-response analysis

Results showed that patients in the QW group achieved a range of exposures which provided the maximal possible benefit.

Tertile analysis showed that primary efficacy endpoints (sustained remission up to Week 52) were similar in all TCZ exposure categories with a small, but not statistically significant trend of increasing efficacy with exposure.

Patients in the 1st tertile in the Q2W group were at a higher risk for an earlier time to flare. Gender was also identified as a statistically significant predictor for the risk of flare with females identified as being at a higher risk. Risk of flare for males was ~3 times lower compared to females (HR = 0.320). The generalizability and the clinical significance of this gender effect are unknown and were further explored. Response rate difference between the placebo (PBO 26 wk) and treatment groups (TCZ Q2W) are essentially the same (the difference is 38.8% for female and 31.3% for male patients).

The reference for the effect of TCZ exposure is Cave8=3.346 μg/mL (=EC50 value). This finding may be influenced by the fact that 75% of the study participants were female due to a higher prevalence of GCA in females. No other prognostic factors had a significant effect on the risk of flare in GCA patients.

Data analysis showed the trend that about one third (lowest exposure tertile) of the patients in the Q2W

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment group would gain benefit due to a higher exposure (Ctrough at week 52). Given that the weekly regimen is envisaged, this is considered acceptable by CHMP.

No clear exposure-safety relationship could be detected. There was a trend of greater decline of haematology parameters (white blood cells, neutrophils, and platelets) with increasing exposure, which reached a plateau at higher exposure levels for white blood cell and neutrophil counts. There was no association of TCZ concentrations with the occurrence of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.

Given that there is a higher exposure in GCA patients compared to RA patients and comparatively low patient numbers, exposure-safety relationships were discussed including the neutrophil loss rate.  Higher exposure in the GCA population did not lead to clinically relevant differences in safety outcomes relative to the RA population.

## Interactions

IL-6 is known to suppress the expression levels of the mRNAs that code for drug metabolizing enzymes (cytochrome P450 enzymes [CYPs]). This fact known from the literature had been confirmed by in-vitro studies, and the effect was particularly pronounced regarding to CYP3A4. TCZ was able to block this effect of Il-6 at therapeutic plasma concentrations. When the function of IL-6 is inhibited in such patients by the administration of TCZ, CYP expression levels may rise above pre-dosing levels and the serum concentrations of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by CYPs may decrease. This has been shown in RA patients using simvastatin as probe molecule. In a study in RA patients levels of simvastatin (CYP3A4) were decreased by 57% one week following a single dose of tocilizumab. Oral glucocorticoids (OGC) (methylprednisolone, dexamethasone) are metabolized by this CYP3A4 so plasma OGC level can decrease much faster than planned. The increased elimination carries the risk of decreased efficacy of OGC when it is co-administered with TCZ in the OCG taper period. There is also the risk of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome. As the issue is not specific for GCA and also relevant of other approved indications such as RA and sJIA, methylprednisolone and dexamethasone have been added to the list of interacting drugs in Section 4.5 with an added warning of GC withdrawal syndrome.

## 2.3.6. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The clinical pharmacology data submitted is considered acceptable by CHMP to support the use of tocilizumab in patients with GCA.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Dose response studies

No dose response studies were conducted.

The rationale for the TCZ doses to be investigated in Study WA28119 was based on the 31 case reports of GCA patients who had been dosed with the approved RA doses of TCZ (4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks [Q4W]) at the time of study start; 29 patients had received 8 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks (in some cases the starting dose was 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks), and 2 patients had received 4 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks (Seitz et al. 2011; Christidis et al. 2011; Beyer et al. 2011; Salvarani et al. 2012; Unizony et al. 2012; Roche data on file). Patients responded well, and no treatment-limiting safety concerns were noted. In the patients dosed with TCZ 8 mg/kg, PD data showed a decrease in post-dose CRP and an increase in post-dose IL-6 levels. The normalization of CRP was sustained throughout the 4-week dosing interval, suggesting adequate blockade of IL-6 signaling in GCA with TCZ 8 mg/kg IV Q4W.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For Study WA28119, the SC route of administration, via pre-filled syringe (PFS), was chosen over the IV route as it provides a more convenient route of administration in the elderly population of patients with GCA (e.g., home administration, no requirement for venous access). The two SC doses selected in the Phase III RA SC program (162 mg QW and Q2W) were assessed. The 162 mg SC QW dose had PD profiles comparable to those for the approved 8 mg/kg Q4W IV dose in RA patients (Study MRA227JP; Study NP22623) and was expected to also show a similar PK/PD profile in GCA patients. This dose was expected to deliver optimized efficacy and safety in GCA. The dose of 162 mg SC Q2W is a lower SC dose option that was expected to deliver an acceptable safety profile with reasonable efficacy.

The CHMP considered acceptable that no dose response studies were conducted since two TCZ doses were studied in phase III WAS28119 study.

## 2.4.2. Main study

A Phase III, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in subjects with giant cell arteritis (WA28119)

## Methods

## Study participants

The target population for this study were adult patients with GCA who have active disease (signs and symptoms and elevated ESR) within the 6 weeks prior to baseline visit. New-onset and relapsed/refractory GCA patients are eligible. New-onset and relapsing disease were defined as follows:

- New-onset: diagnosis of active GCA within 6 weeks of baseline visit (defined as the presence of clinical signs and symptoms and ESR ≥ 30 mm/hour or CRP ≥ 1 mg/dL; elevations in ESR and CRP were not required if the patient had a positive temporal artery biopsy within the 6 weeks prior to baseline).
- Relapsing: diagnosis of GCA &gt; 6 weeks before baseline visit, previous treatment with ≥ 40 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) for at least 2 consecutive weeks at any time, and active GCA within 6 weeks of baseline visit (defined as the presence of clinical signs and symptoms and ESR ≥ 30 mm/hour or CRP ≥ 1 mg/dL; elevations in ESR and CRP were not required if the patient had a positive temporal artery biopsy within the 6 weeks prior to baseline). This included patients who had previously achieved remission and subsequently flared and those who had not achieved remission since the diagnosis of disease (i.e., refractory patients).

A screening period of 6 weeks was defined for the purpose of distinguishing between new-onset and relapsing patients.

## Key inclusion criteria

Diagnosis of GCA classified according to the following criteria:

- Age ≥ 50 years
- History of ESR ≥ 50 mm/hour*

* If historic ESR was unavailable, a history of CRP ≥ 2.45 mg/dL was required. The CRP value was derived from published data both from GCA and RA patients (Hayreh et al. 1997; Wolfe 1997; Paulus et al. 1999).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AND at least one of the following:

- Unequivocal cranial symptoms of GCA (new-onset localized headache, scalp tenderness, temporal artery tenderness or decreased pulsation, ischemia-related vision loss, or otherwise unexplained mouth or jaw pain upon mastication)
- Symptoms of PMR, defined as shoulder and/or hip girdle pain associated with inflammatory morning stiffness

AND at least one of the following:

- Temporal artery biopsy revealing features of GCA
- Evidence of large-vessel vasculitis by angiography or cross-sectional imaging study such as MRA, CTA, or PET-CT

New-onset or relapsing active disease defined as follows:

- New-onset: diagnosis* of GCA within 6 weeks of baseline visit
- Relapsing: diagnosis of GCA &gt; 6 weeks before baseline visit and previous treatment with ≥ 40 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) for at least 2 consecutive weeks at any time

* The 6 week time window had to be calculated from the date of suspected GCA diagnosis. Suspected diagnosis was defined as the date when glucocorticoid therapy was initiated to treat suspected GCA.

AND

- Active GCA within 6 weeks of baseline visit (active disease defined as the presence of clinical signs and symptoms [cranial or PMR] and ESR ≥ 30 mm/hour or CRP ≥ 1 mg/dL). ESR ≥ 30 mm/hour or CRP ≥ 1 mg/dL was not required if active GCA had been confirmed by a positive temporal artery biopsy within 6 weeks of the baseline visit

## Key exclusion criteria

General exclusion criteria

Major surgery within 8 weeks prior to screening or planned major surgery within 12 months after randomization

Transplanted organs (except corneal transplant performed more than 3 months prior to screening)

Major ischemic event, unrelated to GCA, within 12 weeks of screening

The main exclusion criteria related to:

Patients requiring systemic glucocorticoids for conditions other than GCA, which, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with adherence to the fixed glucocorticoid taper regimen and/or to assessment of efficacy in response to the test article

Chronic use of systemic glucocorticoids for &gt; 4 years or inability, in the opinion of the investigator, to withdraw glucocorticoid treatment through protocol-defined taper regimen due to suspected or established adrenal insufficiency

Receipt of &gt; 100 mg daily intravenous methylprednisolone within 6 weeks of Baseline

Active tuberculosis requiring treatment within the previous 3 years

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

Patients were randomized in a 1:1:2:1 ratio into four groups:

- Placebo SC weekly (QW) + 26-week prednisone taper regimen (PBO + 26 wk; n = 50)
- Placebo SC QW + 52-week prednisone taper regimen (PBO + 52 wk; n = 51)
- 162 mg TCZ SC QW + 26-week prednisone taper regimen (TCZ QW; n = 100)
- 162 mg TCZ SC every other week (Q2W) + 26-week prednisone taper regimen (TCZ Q2W; n = 50)

During the screening period, patients could receive glucocorticoids for the treatment of GCA at the discretion of the investigator. By the end of the screening period, patients had to switch to the Sponsor-provided prednisone in order to follow the protocol-defined prednisone taper. At the time of the baseline visit, all patients had to switch from the glucocorticoid prescribed by the investigator to prednisone provided by the Sponsor. The baseline daily dose had to be within the range of prednisone 20 ─ 60 mg/day.

Calcium, bisphosphonates, vitamin D, anti-platelet therapy, lipid-lowering agents, and MTX are allowed as concomitant medication.

## Objectives

Primary efficacy objective: To evaluate the efficacy of TCZ compared to placebo, in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper regimen, in patients with GCA, as measured by the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 following induction and adherence to the protocol-defined prednisone taper regimen.

- Induction of remission had to occur within 12 weeks of randomization.
- Sustained remission was defined as absence of flare following induction of remission up to the 52-week time point.
- o Flare was determined by the investigator and defined as the recurrence of signs or symptoms of GCA and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ≥ 30 mm/h attributable to GCA.
- Patients had to follow the protocol-defined prednisone taper regimen

Remission was defined as the absence of flare (as defined above) and normalisation of C-reactive protein (CRP &lt; 1 mg/dL).

Key secondary objectives of the study: To evaluate the efficacy of TCZ in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper regimen versus placebo in combination with the 52-week prednisone taper regimen, in patients with GCA, as measured by the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 following induction and adherence to the protocol-defined prednisone taper regimen.

Other secondary objectives:

- To assess the efficacy of TCZ in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper regimen versus both placebo groups in patients with GCA, as measured by the following:
- -Time to GCA disease flare after clinical remission
- -Cumulative glucocorticoid dose
- To assess the effect on patient's quality of life of TCZ in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper regimen versus both placebo groups in patients with GCA, based on the patient-reported

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

outcome (PRO) as measured by SF-36 and patient global assessment (PGA) of disease activity on a visual analogue scale (VAS).

To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of TCZ in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper regimen in patients with GCA.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52.

The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 in the TCZ groups in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper regimen compared with the placebo + 52-week prednisone taper.

The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows:

- Time to first GCA disease flare after clinical remission (up to 52 weeks)
- Summary of total cumulative prednisone dose over 52 weeks
- Change from baseline in SF-36 (Physical and Mental Component Summaries) at 52 weeks
- Change from baseline in PGA of disease activity (VAS scale) at 52 weeks

## Sample size

Assuming that the absolute difference in the proportion of patients who are in sustained remission at 52 weeks is equal to 40% (assuming ρTCZ = 70% versus ρ6-mCS = 30%), a sample size of 100 patients in the 162qw TCZ group and 50 patients in both the 162 q2w TCZ group and placebo group (in combination with the 26-week prednisone taper group) will ensure at least 90% power to detect a difference in the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 for both TCZ arms versus placebo at an alpha level of 0.01 (2-sided). In addition, 50 patients will also be included in the 52-week prednisone taper group.

## Randomisation

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:2:1 ratio to treatment arms and randomization was stratified by the baseline prednisone dose (&gt; 30 mg/day, ≤ 30 mg/day prednisone).

The proportion of relapsing patients (GCA diagnosed &gt; 6 weeks before the baseline visit and previous treatment with ≥ 40 mg/day prednisone or equivalent for ≥ 2 consecutive weeks at any time) enrolled was preferentially limited to 70% to ensure some enrolment of new-onset patients (GCA diagnosed within 6 weeks of the baseline visit) but could be increased depending on the rate of enrolment of relapsing versus new-onset patients.

## Blinding (masking)

The study was double-blinded during the first 52 weeks and to maintain the blinding of treatment allocation a Dual Assessor Approach was utilized. As knowledge of certain laboratory data could result in inadvertent unblinding of a patient's treatment, in order to maintain the blind, a Laboratory Assessor was assigned who was responsible for the overall clinical management of the patient outside of their GCA. ESR was measured at each visit and all site personnel, including the Clinical Assessor, were blinded to the results with the exception of the Laboratory Assessor and the Study Coordinator/ESR technician.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Unblinding by the Sponsor occurred at the time of the Week 52 primary analysis. Per regulatory requirements, study treatment was to be unblinded for all unexpected serious adverse events (SAEs) that were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug.

## Statistical methods

There were 5 pre-defined analysis sets: the all-patients set (all randomized patients), the ITT set (randomized patients with at least one dose of TCZ/placebo), the PK-evaluable set, the safety set and the escape population (ITT patients who entered escape therapy). The primary analysis population for all efficacy analyses was the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.

The primary endpoint, proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52, was analysed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test for the ITT population, adjusting for starting prednisone dose ( ≤ 30 mg/day, &gt; 30 mg/day), which was the stratification factor applied at randomization. Non-responder imputation was used for missing data. A tipping point analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the primary analysis. A second sensitivity analysis was performed for disease diagnosis based on signs and symptoms of disease only in order to mitigate against the possibility of biasing the results because of the known PD effect of TCZ on acute phase reactants.

The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 in the TCZ groups in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper regimen compared with the placebo + 52- week prednisone taper group. In order to determine non-inferiority, a two-sided 99.5% CI was constructed for the difference in proportions between each TCZ group and the placebo + 52-week taper group on the basis of the normal approximation and adjusted for the prednisone starting dose and compared to a non-inferiority margin of -22.5% which was defined in the SAP but not in the study protocol. The non-inferiority margin was derived based on one study (Seror et al. 2014) with a prednisone response rate of 71% (95% CI: 52%-86%) and a placebo response rate of 0% (95% CI: 0%-7%). Further 8 studies were listed but not used for the derivation of the non-inferiority margin as they used a different taper regimen or were retrospective, observational studies. Post-hoc analyses of the difference in proportions was performed using an extended Mantel-Haenszel test based on the normal approximation and was adjusted for the baseline stratification factor of prednisone starting dose ( ≤ 30 mg/day, &gt; 30 mg/day).

The primary and key secondary endpoints were tested at a 1% overall significance level (α = 0.01) against two-sided alternatives. The SAP specified two independent hierarchies for the TCZ dose families for which the overall alpha level was equally divided (i.e., α = 0.5% per family) in order to correct the type I error rate for multiple comparisons. Both hierarchies tested the treatment comparisons in a fixed sequential order as specified in the SAP to further control for multiplicity.

Hierarchy 1 tested the primary endpoint for superiority of TCZ QW + 26-week prednisone taper versus placebo + 26-week prednisone taper, followed by the key secondary endpoint for non-inferiority of TCZ QW + 26-week prednisone taper versus placebo + 52-week prednisone taper.

Hierarchy 2 tested the primary endpoint for superiority of TCZ Q2W + 26-week prednisone taper versus placebo + 26-week prednisone taper, followed by the key secondary endpoint for non-inferiority of TCZ Q2W + 26-week prednisone taper versus placebo + 52-week prednisone taper.

All other secondary and exploratory endpoints were not controlled for multiplicity.

However, the key secondary endpoint was also tested for superiority after non-inferiority was met using a Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test based on the normal approximation adjusted for the baseline stratification factor of prednisone starting dose ( ≤ 30 mg/day, &gt; 30 mg/day).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Each of the TCZ treatment groups was compared with both placebo groups for further secondary endpoints. Time to disease flare was analysed using time-to-event methods based on the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox PH model with stratification factor starting prednisone dose. The cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 (including all taper prednisone [both open-label and blinded taper], escape therapy and commercial prednisone) was analysed using a van Elteren test stratified by starting prednisone dose on the basis of the assumption that total cumulative prednisone dose was non-normally distributed or on an appropriate parametric analysis stratifying by starting prednisone dose in case of normal distribution.

Change from baseline in PGA and SF-36 were analysed using a maximum likelihood-based repeated measures model with categorical effects for treatment, baseline prednisone dose ( ≤ 30 mg/day, &gt; 30 mg/day), visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and baseline prednisone dose-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous covariates of baseline score and baseline score-by-visit interaction. An unstructured variance structure was used to model the within-patient errors. The Kenward-Roger approximation was used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. A contrast between treatments at the Week 52 timepoint was the comparison of interest.

During the 52-week double-blind period (Part 1), a total of 41 patients were withdrawn prematurely from blinded study treatment (TCZ/placebo/prednisone): 9 patients (18%) in the PBO + 26 wk group, 5 patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(10%) in the PBO + 52 wk group, 18 patients (18%) in the TCZ QW group and 9 patients (18%) in the TCZ Q2W group. The most common reason for premature discontinuation from study treatment was withdrawal because of an AE (see also below). Nine patients in the TCZ QW group, 7 patients in the TCZ Q2W group, 6 patients in the PBO + 26 wk group and 5 patients in the PBO + 52 wk group were withdrawn from study treatment due to non-safety reasons.

## Recruitment

First patient screened: 15 July 2013

First patient randomized: 22 July 2013

Clinical cut-off for the analysis: 11 April 2016

## Conduct of the study

The original protocol (dated 20 July 2012) was amended three times: on 19 October 2012 (Version 2), on 08 February 2013 (Version 3), on 07 June 2013 in Canada only (Version 4 Canada), and on 22 January 2014 (Version 4 globally, and Version 5 in Canada).

Version 2: dated, 19 October 2012. The most significant changes are related to:

- The inclusion criteria relating to the requirement for a history of ESR ≥ 50 mm/hour and active disease according to an ESR ≥ 30 mm/hour were clarified. The exclusion criteria were revised to exclude only major ischemic events unrelated to GCA and a new exclusion criterion added to exclude patients who received pulsed methylprednisolone within 6 weeks of baseline
- The protocol was aligned with the Sponsor's memorandum on 'Implementing IgE Assay for TCZ Immunogenicity Testing' and immunogenicity testing for patients who discontinued treatment with TCZ was added

Version 3: dated, 08 February 2013. The most significant changes are related to:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Following FDA feedback the definition of relapsing patients was updated to include those with active disease despite at least 2 consecutive weeks of treatment with ≥ 40 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) at any time.
- Following FDA feedback the key secondary endpoint defining a comparison of the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 in the TCZ groups versus the placebo group with 52-week prednisone taper was added.

Version 4: dated, 22 January 2014. The most significant changes are related to:

- To better reflect clinical practice where CRP is replacing ESR in several health centres, the requirement for a CRP ≥ 2.45 mg/dL for patients where a historical ESR value was unavailable was added.
- Removal of the requirement of ESR ≥ 30 mm/hour or CRP ≥ 1 mg/dL to confirm active disease in patients with a positive temporal artery biopsy within 6 weeks of baseline.
- Definition of flare was modified to allow the clinical assessor to consider an elevated ESR as disease flare in the absence of GCA signs and symptoms if, in their opinion, it was attributable to GCA.

Five patients deviated from the protocol-defined prednisone taper. Patients who deviated from the protocol defined prednisone taper were placed back onto the prednisone dose they should have been receiving. If the patient was ahead of the predefined taper schedule then an extra wallet was inserted into the taper schedule via the IVRS and if the patient was behind the predefined taper schedule they were placed onto the correct prednisone taper wallet.

## GCA disease characteristics

## Prednisone dose at baseline

Median prednisone dose at baseline (start of the open-label prednisone taper period) was 35 mg/day (range 5-60 mg) in the TCZ Q2W group and 30 mg/day (range 5-60 mg) in all other treatment groups. Per protocol, patients were to be receiving a starting prednisone dose of 20-60 mg/day at baseline (i.e., 60/50/40/35/30/25 or 20 mg/day). However, 5 patients received the incorrect dose of prednisone at baseline in error. These prednisone starting dose errors were captured as major protocol deviations, although the patients were permitted to remain in the study (see above). Two further patients had prednisone dosing medication errors at baseline one in the PBO + 52 wk group and one patient in the TCZ QW group. These prednisone medication errors were not captured as protocol violations.

All but one of the patients with incorrect prednisone starting doses experienced remission post-baseline.

Analysis of prednisone starting dose by incremental categories (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60 mg) showed that the percentage of patients on each prednisone starting dose category was balanced between each of the treatment groups.

## Concomitant treatment for GCA

Concomitant treatments for GCA (other than blinded study treatment) as determined by the investigator were reported for 67% of patients in the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W groups, 78% of patients in the PBO + 26 wk group and 71% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group. Steroids (including low-dose glucocorticoid treatment) were the most commonly reported concomitant treatments for GCA.

Antimetabolites (methotrexate) were received by 11% of patients in the TCZ QW group, 10% of patients in the TCZ Q2W group, 16% of patients in the PBO + 26 wk group and 18% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group.

Salicylates (aspirin) were taken by 18% of patients in the TCZ QW, TCZ Q2W and PBO + 26 wk groups and 16% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group while analgesics (mainly paracetamol) were taken by 3% of patients in the TCZ QW group, 14% of patients in the TCZ Q2W group, 16% of patients in the PBO + 26 wk group and 12% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group.

Of the 251 patients randomized into the study (100 patients to the TCZ QW group, 50 patients to the TCZ Q2W group, 50 patients to the PBO + 26 wk group and 51 patients to the PBO + 52 wk group), 250 patients received the treatment to which they were assigned. One patient (255730/11341) who was randomized to the TCZ Q2W group withdrew the same day they were randomized and did not receive any study treatment. This patient was excluded from the safety and intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy analysis populations

Significance level for primary endpoints: 0.005

Superiority of both the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W dose groups compared to placebo when combined with a 26-week prednisone taper was demonstrated with regard to the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving sustained remission at Week 52, following induction and adherence to the protocol-defined prednisone taper.

A tipping point analysis was performed where escape patients and patients with GCA flare prior to withdrawal were classed as non-responders. All other withdrawals (2 in PBO group, 14 in TCZ QW, 5 in TCZ Q2W) were subsequently classed as either non-responder or responder and change in the primary endpoint was investigated. No tipping point was observed with increasing number of withdrawals classed as responders.

A post-hoc analysis of the individual criteria of the composite endpoint of sustained remission was performed. In this analysis, the percentage of patients meeting each individual criterion for not achieving sustained remission was determined. Results showed that higher proportions of patients flared and subsequently received treatment with escape prednisone in the placebo groups compared to the TCZ groups.

Evaluation of signs and symptoms present at the time of first GCA flare showed that the majority of patients in the TCZ groups presented with clinical signs and symptoms in the absence of elevated ESR attributed to GCA. In contrast, the placebo patients were reported with flares due to clinical signs and symptoms both in the presence and absence of an elevated ESR attributable to GCA. Eight first flares due to an elevated ESR in the absence of clinical GCA signs and symptoms were reported in the placebo groups compared to one such flare in the TCZ QW group only.

Elevated CRP without flare includes all patients who had two consecutive CRP elevations between Week 12 and Week 52. Consecutive CRP elevations (without flare) were reported in higher proportions of patients in the placebo groups (PBO + 26 wk: 52.0%; PBO + 52 wk: 60.8%) compared to the TCZ groups (TCZ QW: 5.0%; TCZ Q2W: 6.1%). The majority of CRP elevations were in those patients classed as non-responders due to reporting a GCA flare, having received treatment with escape prednisone or being unable to adhere to the protocol defined prednisone taper. Fifteen of the patients with CRP elevations represent those who had not reported a flare, had not received treatment with escape prednisone and had adhered to the protocol defined prednisone taper, i.e. the two consecutive elevated CRP elevations was the only component of the remission definition that rendered these patients non-responders. A sensitivity analysis that classed these fifteen patients as responders still showed superiority of the two TCZ doses over PBO + 26 wk.

There were three patients in the TCZ QW group who received &gt; 100 mg additional prednisone from Week 12 to Week 52 (including all escape therapy, commercial prednisone and taper prednisone [both open-label and blinded taper]). One patient in each of the placebo groups moved onto escape prednisone but did not receive &gt;100 mg treatment. A sensitivity analysis that classed the three patients with &gt;100 mg additional prednisone as non-responders still showed superiority of the two TCZ doses over PBO + 26 wk.

## Key secondary efficacy endpoint

The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 in the TCZ groups in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper compared with placebo in combination with a 52-week prednisone taper.

Both the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W dose groups met non-inferiority and in post hoc analyses subsequently superiority to placebo with regard to the key secondary endpoint.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The subsequent CMH superiority analysis, which was added post-hoc, yielded p-values of &lt; 0.0001 for the TCZ QW group and 0.0002 for the TCZ Q2W group versus placebo which indicated that not only was TCZ combined with a 26-week prednisone taper non-inferior to placebo when combined with a 52-week prednisone taper but the difference in response rates met the criteria for statistical superiority of TCZ over placebo for both dose groups.

Superiority of the TCZ QW dose group to the 52-week prednisone only control group was confirmed in all sensitivity analyses. Superiority of the TCZ Q2W arm to PBO + 52 wk was also confirmed in the sensitivity analysis that included all subjects regardless of adherence to the prednisone taper. The TCZ Q2W arm met non-inferiority for both the sensitivity analysis excluding the requirement of normalized CRP (&lt; 1 mg/dL) from the definition of remission and the analysis of completers adhering to study medication, but could not show superiority in these analyses.

## Secondary efficacy endpoints

All other secondary endpoints were tested at a type I error level of 1% but were not part of the confirmatory testing sequence and not subject to multiplicity control. Hence, results are not confirmatory.

- Time to first GCA disease flare after clinical remission (up to 52 weeks)

Time to event analysis (stratified by starting prednisone dose) revealed a statistically significantly lower risk of GCA disease flare in both TCZ groups compared to the 26-week prednisone only control group. Analysis comparing the TCZ groups to the 52-week prednisone only control group showed a statistically significant lower risk of disease flare in the TCZ QW group, whereas the numerical improvement achieved in the TCZ Q2W group did not reach the pre-specified threshold for statistical significance (p &lt; 0.01 defined for other secondary endpoints).

- Summary of total cumulative prednisone dose over 52 weeks

Expected cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 was calculated based on a patient's starting prednisone dose, the taper schedule (26-week or 52-week taper), and the assumption that the patient continued the taper without error.

Median expected cumulative prednisone dose was, therefore, similar in the TCZ QW (1337.0 mg), TCZ Q2W (1442.0 mg), and PBO + 26 wk (1337.0 mg) groups and higher in the PBO + 52 wk (2607.5 mg) group. Median actual cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 (including all taper prednisone [both open-label and blinded taper]; escape therapy and commercial concomitant prednisone) was 1862.0 mg in both of the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W treatment groups compared with 3296.0 mg in the PBO + 26 wk group and 3817.5 mg in the PBO + 52 wk group. The associated stratified analysis p-values for TCZ versus placebo in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper were p &lt; 0.0001 for the TCZ QW group and p = 0.0003 for the TCZ Q2W group, indicating a statistically significantly lower cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 in both the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W treatment groups when compared to placebo in combination with a 26 week prednisone taper period.

Corresponding stratified analysis p-values for the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W groups versus placebo in combination with a 52-week prednisone taper were both p &lt; 0.0001, indicating a statistically significantly lower cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 in both the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W treatment groups compared to placebo in combination with a 52 week prednisone taper.

Of note, actual prednisone doses were much higher in all 4 study arms than expected (based on the individual taper regimen). Median expected cumulative prednisone doses were 1337.00 (PBO + 26 wk), 2607.50  (PBO + 52 wk), 1337.00 (TCZ QW), and 1442.00 (TCZ Q2W) .

- Change from baseline in SF-36 (Physical and Mental Component Summaries) at 52 weeks

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The increased change from baseline to Week 52 for the SF-36 Mental Component Score showed a numeric improvement in all treatment groups, placebo and TCZ). Comparison of TCZ to prednisone taper showed a numerical benefit of TCZ QW compared to PBO + 26 wk (0.61, 99% CI: -5.86,7.07) and PBO + 52 wk (4.44, 99% CI: -0.69,9.56); A numerical benefit pf TCZ Q2W was observed in comparison to PBO + 52 wk (3.27, 99% CI: -2.59,9.14), while a numerical disadvantage over PBO + 26 wk was observed (-0.56, 99% CI: -7.64,6.53).

For the SF-36 Physical Component Score, the change from baseline to Week 52 showed a numeric improvement in both of the TCZ groups, while both placebo groups showed a slight worsening in PCS. Comparing treatment arms, only the difference observed in the TCZ QW group compared to the PBO + 52 wk group was statistically significant at the 0.01 significance level (p = 0.0024). All other comparisons only showed a numerical benefit of TCZ arms.

- Change from baseline in PGA of disease activity (VAS scale) at 52 weeks

The patient global VAS item rates patients' assessment of the effect of their GCA at the present time. A decline from baseline score (negative change) indicates improvement.

All treatment groups (placebo and TCZ) showed a decline from baseline in patient's global VAS scores. The TCZ Q2W group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement over the PBO + 26 wk group (p = 0.0059) and PBO + 52 wk group (p = 0.0081). While not statistically significant at the pre-specified level of 0.01, for the TCZ QW group, the mean change from baseline scores was numerically lower in the TCZ QW group than both PBO groups. A post-hoc sensitivity analysis of the change from baseline to Week 52 in Patient's Global VAS based on observed data only (where post-escape PGA VAS data were included in the analysis and not considered as missing) again showed a statistically significant improvement for the TCZ Q2W group over both the PBO + 26 wk group (p = 0.0091) and PBO + 52 wk group (p = 0.0027) and a numerical improvement in mean change from baseline scores for the TCZ QW group compared with both PBO groups, although neither reached statistical significance at the pre-specified level of 0.01.

Notes

Superiority of TCZ over PBO + 52 wk tapering was analysed post-hoc. Both TCZ arms had significantly higher response rates (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.0002, respectively) with an overall significance level of 1% (0.5% per comparison).

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Analyses across trials were not performed.

## Clinical studies in special populations

No dedicated studies in special population were performed in context of the development in GCA.

## Supportive studies

## Long term extension WA28119

Part 2 of the study WA28119 (presented as main study above) is an ongoing 104-week open-label extension/ long-term follow up phase, ending at Week 156. The purpose of Part 2 is to assess the long-term safety and maintenance of efficacy after 52 weeks of therapy with TCZ, to explore the rate of relapse and the requirement for TCZ therapy beyond 52 weeks, and to gain insight into the potential long-term steroid sparing effect of TCZ.

Use of SC open-label TCZ at the Week 52 visit was dependent on the remission status of the patient at that visit. If a patient was in remission their TCZ/placebo SC injections were stopped and they were observed in the absence of further TCZ treatment. If a patient was not in remission at the Week 52 visit or if a patient relapsed/flared at any time during Part 2, they could receive SC open-label TCZ QW at the discretion of the investigator, regardless of their allocated treatment regime in Part 1 of the study (to which the investigator remained blinded). Treatment with glucocorticoids and methotrexate are permitted at any time during Part 2 at a dose and duration chosen by the investigator. As in Part 1 of the study, GCA flare was determined by the investigator and was based on the assessment of clinical signs and symptoms and ESR elevations attributed to GCA. The sites remained blinded to the CRP levels during Part 2 of the study.

Patient data were treated and subsequently analysed based on response to treatment in Part 1 of the study. In Part 1, 88 responders (those who met the primary endpoint) were followed off TCZ treatment to assess the maintenance of response enabled by one year of TCZ treatment. Part 1 non-responders were analysed to determine whether they can attain remission following treatment with open-label TCZ QW during Part 2 of the study. Both groups were evaluated to assess the effectiveness of open-label TCZ QW treatment in bringing about remission following a GCA flare.

## Patient flow

At the time of the Part 1 data cut-off (11 April 2016), there were 88 patients who had reached the Week 100 visit or beyond, with some patients having participated up to Week 136. Data for patients who did not reach the Week 100 visit due to withdrawal from the study or death during Part 2 are also included in the analysis.

Of the 88 patients evaluated at the time of the data cut (see figure 11), 45 met the primary endpoint during Part 1 of the study (i.e., were in sustained remission from Week 12 to Week 52; 5 in each of the PBO groups, 24 in the TCZ QW group and 11 in the TCZ Q2W arm). Of the remaining 43 patients who were non-responders in Part 1 of the study, 34 were in remission at the Week 52 visit due to treatment with escape prednisone. The remaining nine patients were not in remission at the Week 52 visit.

## Treatment at week 52

Upon entering Part 2 of the study, 43 of the 45 patients who met the primary endpoint in Part 1 stopped their TCZ/placebo injections and were followed up off TCZ treatment; erroneously, one patient each from the TCZ QW and PBO + 52 wk groups started open-label TCZ (in the absence of glucocorticoids) at the Week 52 visit despite being in remission. Six patients received treatment other than or in addition to open label TCZ at the Week 52 visit: three received glucocorticoids alone, one received glucocorticoids plus MTX and two received MTX alone.

The 34 patients who were non-responders in Part 1 of the study and were in remission at Week 52 were either followed up off treatment or received treatment with open-label TCZ and/or glucocorticoids and/or MTX.

The nine patients who were non-responders in Part 1 of the study and were not in remission at Week 52 were treated with open-label TCZ and/or glucocorticoids and/or MTX.

Two patients (Patients 255202/10062 and 253755/10262) were receiving treatment for their GCA at the time of first flare in Part 2; both patients were from the original TCZ QW group and were receiving 5 mg/day glucocorticoids, one (Patient 253755/10262) in combination with 15 mg MTX QW.

Two patients (255228/10484 and 255207/10041) flared within two weeks of entering Part 2, but the majority of relapses occurred at least 12 weeks after the discontinuation of TCZ/placebo injections at Week 52 There was no pattern to the timing of flares during Part 2.

## Relapses on Open-label TCZ

Forty five patients received treatment with open-label TCZ during Part 2 of the study. Eighteen patients started open-label TCZ at Week 52. Twenty-eight patients had a GCA flare in Part 2 that was treated with open-label TCZ. Two patients erroneously started open-label TCZ at study Week 53.

Second relapse inPart 2

Eleven patients (65%) relapsed while receiving treatment with open-label TCZ; ten were non-responders in Part 1 (due to non-adherence to the protocol defined prednisone taper, elevations in CRP or withdrawal from the study) or had flared during Part 1 of the study. Three patients relapsed within a few weeks of starting open-label TCZ, which likely represents inadequate disease control after the initiation of open-label TCZ in Part 2.

Four of the flares were second flares in patients who had initiated open-label TCZ to treat a previous relapse during Part 2. One patient relapsed twice while receiving treatment with open-label TCZ.

Of the 11 patients who relapsed on open-label TCZ during Part 2, six were receiving concomitant treatment with glucocorticoids and one patient was also receiving MTX at the time of flare.

## Tocilizumab for induction and maintenance of remission in giant cell arteritis: A Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (supportive phase II investor-initiated study ML25676)

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase II study the use of IV TCZ in 30 patients aged &gt; 50 years and diagnosed with GCA according to the 1990 ACR criteria (Villiger et al. 2016). Patients with new onset or relapsing disease were randomized (2:1) to receive 8 mg/kg IV TCZ every 4 weeks (Q4W) or placebo over 1 year. Patients received concomitant glucocorticoids (prednisolone), at a starting dose of 1 mg/kg/day and were tapered in a controlled fashion to 0.1 mg/kg/day by Week 12. Subsequently, the daily glucocorticoid dose was further reduced by 1 mg every month.

## Efficacy Results

Complete remission by Week 12 was reached in 17/20 (85%) patients treated with TCZ compared to 4/10 (40%) patients treated with placebo (difference [95% CI]: 45% [11%, 79%]; p = 0.0301). Relapse-free

survival was achieved in 17/20 (85%) patients in the TCZ group and 2/10 (20%) patients in the placebo group by Week 52 (difference [95% CI]: 65% [36%, 94%]; p = 0.0010). The mean time difference to stop glucocorticoids was 12 weeks in favour of TCZ (95% CI: 7, 17; p &lt; 0.0001), leading to a weight-adjusted cumulative prednisolone dose of 43 mg/kg (median IQR: 39, 52) in the TCZ group versus 110 mg/kg (median IQR: 88, 150) in the placebo group (p = 0.0005) after 52 weeks.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

Study WA28119 is a Phase III, multicentre, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, parallel group superiority trial in patients with GCA designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TCZ for the treatment of GCA. The study includes a 52-week blinded period (Part 1) followed by a 104-week open-label period (Part 2), with a total duration of the study of 156 weeks.

The target population for this study were adult patients with GCA who have active disease (signs and symptoms and elevated ESR) within the 6 weeks prior to baseline visit. Because the Sponsor anticipated that the vast majority of subjects enrolled to WA28119 would meet the ACR 1990 classification criteria for the diagnosis of GCA, the inclusion criteria were broadly based around these criteria. However, since much progress has been made in understanding the clinical presentation and pathology of the disease since 1990 the sponsor modified these criteria. New vascular imaging modalities having all emerged and altered the approach to diagnosing GCA, therefore, revised diagnostic criteria were used that are consistent with current clinical practice. These inclusion criteria that consider a broader array of cranial symptoms that occur in GCA beyond headache alone (e.g., jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, ischemia-related vision loss); PMR symptoms occurring in the setting of GCA proven by either biopsy or imaging; and evidence of large vessel vasculitis in cross-sectional imaging (MRA, CTA, PET-CT, or angiography), none of which were included in the 1990 criteria. This approach is considered acceptable by CHMP.

Patients were screened up to 6 weeks (42 days) prior to the baseline randomization visit. During the screening period, patients could receive glucocorticoids for the treatment of GCA at the discretion of the investigator. By the end of the screening period patients had to switch to the Sponsor-provided prednisone in order to follow the protocol-defined prednisone taper in combination with either placebo or two different TCZ regimens. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:2:1 ratio into four groups: Placebo SC weekly (QW) + 26-week prednisone taper regimen (PBO + 26 wk; n = 50); Placebo SC QW + 52-week prednisone taper regimen (PBO + 52 wk; n = 51), 162 mg TCZ SC QW + 26-week prednisone taper regimen (TCZ QW; n = 100)and 162 mg TCZ SC every other week (Q2W) + 26-week prednisone taper regimen (TCZ Q2W; n = 50). The corner stone of management of GCA is immediate initiation of treatment (i.e. high-dose glucocorticosteroide treatment) after clinical suspicion of GCA is raised in order to prevent further visual loss and other ischaemic complications. It is further recommend to maintain the initial high dose for a month and taper gradually thereafter (BSR and BHPR Guidelines for the management of giant cell arteritis: doi:10.1093/rheumatology/keq039b; EULAR recommendations for the management of large vessel vasculitis Ann Rheum Dis 2009;68:318-323 doi:10.1136/ard.2008.088351). Improvement of symptoms is typical expected within 72 hours after initiation of standard therapy. However, TCZ was initiated up to 42 days (6 weeks) after initiation of treatment for GCA; in parallel the prednisone taper regimen was started.

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of TCZ compared to placebo, in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper regimen. Therefore the MAH implemented the requirement 'induction of remission within 12 weeks of randomisation', thus remission was investigated max 18 weeks after (suspected) onset of GCA. For the purpose to evaluate the primary study endpoint this approach is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

acceptable. Unfortunately the design of study WA28119 does not allow to directly assessing the question of early disease control; it rather enables to evaluate TCZ supporting the prednisone tapering regimen.

It is acknowledged that early disease control in GCA is important - a fact that is reinforced by way of treatment guidelines stating that high-dose glucocorticoid therapy should be initiated immediately upon clinical suspicion of GCA (Warrington and Matteson, 2007; Dasgupta et al, 2010). However, despite the rapidity of the initial response, the majority of patients relapse either during tapering or after complete withdrawal of glucocorticoids (Martinez-Lado et al 2011; Andersson et al 1986; Proven et al 2003; Alba et al 2014). Therefore, there is still an unmet need in identifying an agent capable of maintaining disease remission during glucocorticoid tapering, particularly when daily doses begin to reach levels at which patients typically experience disease relapse.

Data from the WA28119 study demonstrate a superior treatment effect of TCZ at 52 weeks, but also show an impact on treatment response as early as Week 1 after initiation of TCZ treatment. Thus, the differences in efficacy across groups were present at the earliest possible time points for assessment. These exploratory findings provide evidence on the efficacy of TCZ in establishing early disease control, even though this was not the principal aim of study WA28119.

The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 treated with TCZ (QW or Q2W) or placebo in combination with 26 weeks prednisone taper regimen. The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 treated with TCZ (QW or Q2W) or placebo in combination with 52 weeks prednisone taper regimen. Both endpoints are considered acceptable.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

A total of 251 patients were enrolled into the study (100 patients to the TCZ QW group, 50 patients to the TCZ Q2W group, 50 patients to the PBO + 26 wk group and 51 patients to the PBO + 52 wk group), 250 patients received the treatment to which they were assigned. GCA disease characteristics were well balanced between the treatment groups.

The efficacy data are based on the primary analysis, which was conducted after all patients had completed the double-blind treatment period (i.e., 52 weeks of study treatment unless the patient was prematurely withdrawn). Patients who flared and received escape therapy, who did not adhere to the prednisone taper regimen (i.e., were given more than 100 mg additional glucocorticoids), who had two consecutive CRP elevations (&gt; 1 mg/dL) between Weeks 12 and 52, who withdrew from the study prior to Week 52, or for whom a remission status could not be determined at Week 52, were classed as non-responders in the primary analysis.

The primary endpoint, superiority of each of the TCZ arms (with 26 week prednisone tapering) over PBO with 26 week tapering, was met. Sustained remission at Week 52 was achieved in 56.0% of patients in the TCZ QW group, 53.1% of patients in the TCZ Q2W group and 14.0% of patients in the PBO + 26 wk group. The difference in the percentage of responders between the TCZ QW group and placebo was 42.0% (99.5% CI: 18.0 to 66.0), with an associated p-value of &lt; 0.0001. The difference in the percentage of responders between the TCZ Q2W dose group and placebo was 39.1% (99.5% CI: 12.5 to 65.7), with a p-value of &lt; 0.0001.

The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 in the TCZ groups in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper compared with placebo in combination with a 52-week prednisone taper. Both the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W dose groups met non-inferiority. In post hoc analyses subsequently superiority to placebo was shown with regard to the key secondary endpoint. Sustained remission at Week 52 was achieved by 56.0% of patients in the TCZ QW group, 53.1% of patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in the TCZ Q2W group and 17.6% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group. The difference in the percentage of responders in the TCZ QW group versus the PBO + 52 wk group was 38.4% (99.5% CI: 17.9 to 58.8) and the difference in the percentage of responders in the TCZ Q2W group versus the PBO + 52 wk group was 35.4% (99.5% CI: 10.4 to 60.4). The lower boundaries of the 99.5% CIs for both TCZ dose groups were greater than the non-inferiority margin of -22.5%, meeting the criteria for non-inferiority. Of note, the non-inferiority analysis was not planned in the protocol. The margin was derived in the SAP based on a single study only. Clinical grounds for the margin were not specified.

Superiority of the TCZ QW dose group to the 52-week prednisone only control group was confirmed in all sensitivity analyses, but not for the TCZ Q2W group, which failed to show significant superiority in some of the sensitivity analyses.

Although the median cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 was higher than expected in all groups, a statistically significantly lower cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 in both the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W treatment groups in combination with a 26 week prednisone taper period when compared to placebo was reported. Median actual cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 (including all taper prednisone [both open-label and blinded taper]; escape therapy and commercial concomitant prednisone) was 1862.0 mg in both of the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W treatment groups compared with 3296.0 mg in the PBO + 26 wk group and 3817.5 mg in the PBO + 52 wk group. The associated stratified analysis p-values for TCZ versus placebo in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper were p &lt; 0.0001 for the TCZ QW group and p = 0.0003 for the TCZ Q2W group. The significant lower cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 in both TCZ groups as compared to the placebo groups might have contributed to the more favourable safety profile under TCZ treatment compared to placebo.

Data from the LTE part of study WA28119 are available for 88 patients, followed up to 136 weeks. Of these 43 of the 45 patients who met the primary endpoint in Part 1, stopped their TCZ/placebo injections and were followed up off TCZ treatment. Of the 45 patients who met the primary endpoint in Part 1 of the study, 27 remained in remission throughout available follow up during Part 2. GCA flares were observed in 18 patients; 1/5 from the PBO + 26 wk group (20%), 1/5 from the PBO + 52 wk group (20%), 8/24 from the TCZ QW group (33%), and 8/11 from the TCZ Q2W group (73%).

These data suggest that in the TCZ groups a higher incidence of flares was observed after stopped their TCZ treatment at 52 weeks than in the placebo groups. However, since the study is still ongoing and these interim data are derived from small patient groups, a firm conclusion cannot be drawn at this point in time. However a rebound after TCZ discontinuation cannot be totally excluded.

The final WA28119 study report will be submitted by Q4 2018, where a possible rebound effect can be further re-assessed based on new data. This long term data will allow a proper assessment of the long-term efficacy i.e. maintenance of efficacy and safety. The MAH has committed to state the lack of data in the RMP under missing information. The final CSR and updated RMP will be submitted by Q1 2019.

Additional evidence for efficacy of TCZ in the treatment of GCA was provided from the data of the investigator-initiated, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase II study ML25676. Patients aged &gt; 50 years with new onset or relapsing GCA (according to the 1990 ACR criteria) (Villiger et al. 2016) were randomized (2:1) to receive 8 mg/kg IV TCZ every 4 weeks (Q4W) or placebo over 1 year. Patients received concomitant glucocorticoids (prednisolone), at a starting dose of 1 mg/kg/day and were tapered in a controlled fashion to 0.1 mg/kg/day by Week 12. Subsequently, the daily glucocorticoid dose was further reduced by 1 mg every month. The study showed a statistically significant difference in the proportion of TCZ-treated patients achieving complete remission at Week 12 (primary endpoint) compared to those receiving glucocorticoids alone (TCZ plus glucocorticoids: 85% [17/20]; placebo plus glucocorticoids: 40% [4/10]). There was also a statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients that were relapse-free at Week 52 in the TCZ group in comparison to the placebo group as well as a significant reduction in the cumulative weight-adjusted prednisolone dose between the TCZ and placebo groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Although the design of this trial was more suitable to evaluate the effect on TCZ on the entire course of GCA, especially the effect on timely disease control, these data are only supportive since the TCZ dose and route of administration (8 mg/kg IV Q4W) differ from the claimed dosage. Moreover the provided data (publication) do not allow an in-depth assessment.

Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Study WA28119 met its primary and key secondary endpoints demonstrating that TCZ 162 mg SC QW and Q2W in combination with a 26 wk or 52 wk resp. prednisone tapering regime are effective at maintaining steroid-free remission in patients with GCA.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

TCZ is a recombinant humanised anti-human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) that binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6R, thereby inhibiting IL-6-mediated signalling. TCZ is available in 2 different pharmaceutical forms to allow either administration by intravenous (IV) infusion or by subcutaneous (SC) injection.

In adult patient both pharmaceutical forms of TCZ are approved. TCZ is indicated in combination with methotrexate (MTX), for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients who have either responded inadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. In these patients, TCZ can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate.

The recommended dose for IV administration is 8 mg/kg TCZ every 4 weeks (q4w).

For SC administration, the recommended dose is 162 mg once every week (qw).

Regarding the safety profile of TCZ in the adult RA population, unfavourable effects include infection, gastro-intestinal disorders, infusion reactions, skin disorders, neutropenia, elevation in hepatic enzymes and lipid parameters.

The safety data base supporting this application is derived primarily from the single pivotal Phase III Study WA28119. After the 52-week double-blind treatment period (reported in this assessment report), all patients entered the 104-week LTE/long-term follow-up (Part 2) of the study. Based on the investigator's assessment of GCA disease activity at the end of the 52-week double-blind period, the patient was either given the option to receive open-label TCZ 162 mg QW (in case of persistent disease activity/flare) or was followed up off treatment for maintenance of established remission at the investigators discretion. A patient's GCA therapy could be adjusted at any time during Part 2 of the study at the investigator's discretion and on the basis of disease activity. This could have included initiation/termination of open-label TCZ 162 mg QW and/or changes to corticosteroid or methotrexate (MTX) treatment.

In addition to the Phase III study, the following data are submitted as supportive safety data

- Pooled long-term safety data with IV TCZ in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population, referred to as LTE All-exposure RA population
- Background rates of adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and glucocorticoid- induced toxicity information from an epidemiological analysis of the MarketScan health claims database

The MarketScan analysis is a retrospective cohort study of glucocorticoid use and AEs in patients with GCA (who were not treated with TCZ) in the United States from 1 January 2000 to 30 June 2015.

Background AESI rates and glucocorticoid induced toxicity in GCA (in absence of TCZ exposure) from the MarketScan analysis are presented to contextualize rates reported with TCZ treatment in Study WA28119.

## Patient exposure

## Study WA28119

The Safety population included data from 250 patients who received at least one administration of study drug and had at least one post-dose safety assessment (withdrawal, AE, death, laboratory assessment, or vital sign assessment). Of the 251 randomized patients, 1 patient who was randomized to the TCZ Q2W group withdrew prior to receiving their first dose of TCZ. This patient was excluded from the Safety analysis population.

Median study duration was identical (1.0 year) in all treatment groups. Based on the number of doses of SC study treatment (TCZ/ placebo) received, the patient-years of exposure were similar in the TCZ Q2W and placebo groups. Given that twice as many patients were randomized to the TCZ QW group, the total number of patient years of exposure (86.41 patient-years) was much higher than in the TCZ Q2W group (43.7 patient-years), PBO + 26 wk group (44.3 patient-years) and PBO + 52 wk group (46.0 patient-years).

## Glucocorticoid-induced toxicity

Events that are consistent with glucocorticoid-induced toxicity from Part 1 of Study WA28119 were analysed retrospectively using criteria that were developed by the Sponsor prior to database lock.

## Total prednisone exposure

Median total prednisone treatment duration was 52 weeks (1 year) in all treatment groups, accounting for open-label prednisone taper, blinded prednisone/placebo as well as escape and commercial prednisone (for concomitant conditions). Median total cumulative prednisone dose was identical in the TCZ QW and TCZ

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Q2W groups (1862 mg). However, as a result of the increased use of escape glucocorticoid therapy (and longer prednisone taper period in the PBO + 52 wk group), median total cumulative prednisone dose was higher in the PBO + 26 wk (3296 mg) and PBO + 52 wk (3817.5 mg) groups.

## Study WA28119 Part 2 - open-label extension (Part 2)

Eighty-eight patients included in the data analysis of Part 2 had at least 100 weeks of follow-up in the study. As of the data cut-off date (11 April 2016), some patients had continued in Part 2 of the study up to Week 136 (scheduled visit); hence the range for duration of follow-up in Part 2 ranges from 48 to 84 weeks. The majority (66/88) of these patients had received TCZ either during Part 1 or Part 2 of the study. Of the 88 patients; 50 had received either TCZ QW or TCZ Q2W during Part 1, and 27 of these patients started open-label TCZ during Part 2 of the study. Of the 38 patients, who were randomized to the placebo groups during Part 1, a further 16 patients received open-label TCZ during Part 2 of the study.

Exposure in PY is not summarized for this period because there was no predefined treatment regimen, leading to inconsistent exposure to study drug within or between patients.

## Phase II investigator-initiated trial ML25676

Twenty patients received TCZ + prednisolone (hereafter referred to as the TCZ group) and 10 patients received placebo + prednisolone (hereafter referred to as the placebo group).

## Clinical trial information from patients with RA treated with IV tocilizumab

The safety dataset (May 2012 data cut; referred to as the LTE all-exposure RA population) includes data from 4171 patients who received at least 1 dose of TCZ in the clinical trial program.

The numbers of individual events were numerically or proportionally (for comparison to TCZ QW) lower in the TCZ treatment groups (470 and 486 in the placebo groups vs. 810 events in the TCZ QW group [which included twice as many patients than the other groups] and 432 events in the TCZ Q2W group). This translates into numerically higher rates of AEs in the placebo groups compared with the TCZ groups:

PBO + 26 wk group 990.8 [95% CI: 903.2, 1084.5] AEs per 100 PY

PBO + 52 wk group 1011.2 [95% CI: 923.3, 1105.3] AEs per 100 PY vs.

TCZ QW 872.0 [95% CI: 813.0, 934.2] AEs per 100 PY

TCZ Q2W group 948.0 [95% CI: 860.7, 1041.7] AEs per 100 PY

By preferred term, the most commonly reported all-grade AEs were headache (non- GCA related) reported in 27% of patients in the TCZ QW group, 20% of patients in the TCZ Q2W group, 32% of patients in the PBO + 26 wk group and 24% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group, nasopharyngitis reported in 29% of patients in the TCZ QW group, 25% of patients in the TCZ Q2W group, 18% of patients in the PBO + 26 wk group and 26% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group, edema peripheral reported in 16% of patients in the TCZ QW group, 25% of patients in the TCZ Q2W group, 16% of patients in the PBO + 26 wk group and 12% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group, and arthralgia reported in 13% of patients in the TCZ QW group, 16% of patients in the TCZ Q2W group, 22% of patients in the PBO + 26 wk group and 16% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group.

AEs considered related to blinded study treatment (TCZ, prednisone or both) by the investigator (i.e., TCZ, prednisone, or both) were reported in 68% of patients in the TCZ QW group, 74% of patients in the TCZ Q2W group, 64% of patients in the PBO + 26 wk group and 53% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group. The SOCs with the highest incidence of AEs considered related to study treatment by the investigator were Infections and Infestations (most commonly [i.e., ≥ 5% overall incidence] nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, cystitis, and oral herpes), Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (most commonly alopecia), General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (most commonly oedema peripheral), and Gastrointestinal Disorders.

## Study WA28119 Part 2 - open-label extension

Eighty-eight patients were included in the Part 2 data cut. The majority (66/88) of these patients had received TCZ either during Part 1 or Part 2 of the study.

Eighty-one of the 88 patients (92.0%) reported at least one AE in Part 2 of Study WA28119. Causality has not been assessed in the evaluation of non-serious events.

The highest incidence of AEs was reported in the Infections and Infestations SOC (51/88 [58.0%]); most commonly nasopharyngitis (15/88 [17.0%]) and bronchitis (10/88 [11.4%]). This was followed by AEs in the Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders SOC (44/88 [50.0%]; most commonly arthralgia (11/88 [12.5%]) and pain in extremity (6/88 [6.8%]), Nervous System Disorders SOC (23/88 [26.1%]); most commonly headache (7/88 [8.0%]), and General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions SOC

(19/88 [21.6%]); most commonly fatigue (5/88 [5.7%]).

Of the 404 AEs reported in Part 2 of Study WA28119, the majority were either mild (Grade 1; 282 events) or moderate (Grade 2; 92 events) in intensity. Twenty-eight severe (Grade 3) events were reported; the majority of which were from the SOCs of Infections and Infestations and Vascular Disorders.

The SAE rate per 100 PY of exposure was numerically lower in both TCZ arms compared with the placebo arms, with the highest AE rate occurring in the PBO + 52 wk group.

The most frequently reported SAEs occurred in the SOC of Infections and Infestations, with events for 7% (7/100) of patients in the TCZ QW group, 4% (2/49) of patients in the TCZ Q2W group, 4% (2/50) of patients in the PBO + 26 wk group, and 12% (6/51) of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group. By preferred term, the only SAEs reported in more than 1 patient in any treatment group were gastroenteritis and herpes zoster, both reported by 2 patients in the PBO + 52 wk group (and 1 patient in the TCZ QW group), and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hypertensive crisis reported by 2 patients in the TCZ QW group

No deaths were reported during Part 1 of Study WA28119.

## Study WA28119 Part 2 - open-label extension

One patient in the PBO + 26 wk group (Part 1) reported a life-threatening (Grade 4) SAE of urosepsis in Part 2.

One fatal event of aortic dissection was reported in Part 2 of Study WA28119 until the cut-off date of 11 April 2016.

## Phase II investigator-initiated trial ML25676

Seven SAEs were reported in 7 patients (35%) in the TCZ group compared with10 events in 5 patients (50%) in the placebo group.

## Clinical trial information from patients with RA treated with IV tocilizumab

In the LTE All-exposure RA population, 94/4171 patients died, leading to an overall rate of 0.6 events per 100 PY. The most common causes of death by SOC were infections (25 patients), cardiac disorders (16 patients), and malignancies.

One patient in the TCZ group had severe headache with tinnitus leading to admittance to hospital, the symptoms were not judged to be caused by GCA.

Three serious gastrointestinal complications were reported in the TCZ group: one patient not taking prescribed pantoprazole developed a pre-pyloric ulcer perforation, the second suffered hepatopathy due to an undefined viral infection, and the third patient underwent gastrointestinal endoscopy due to gastrointestinal bleeding 12 days after start of TCZ treatment.

One eye infection due to Moraxella catarrhalis and herpes led to inpatient treatment in a patient in the TCZ group.

A case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome developed in another TCZ patient 3 days after the third infusion, the causal relationship could not be determined because multiple drugs had been started within the possible timeframe.

The causality of AEs reported above in the TCZ and placebo treatment groups was not provided in the publication of the study.

Glucocorticoid-related comorbidities included severe psychosis in one of the patients in the TCZ group and

immobilizing steroid-induced myopathy and hyperglycaemia in two patients in the placebo group.

One cardiovascular-related death was reported in the placebo group.

## Adverse events of special interest

## Infections (Infections and Infestations System Organ Class [SOC])

- Study WA28119 (52 weeks double blind treatment)

There were no marked differences in the overall incidence of patients with infections between the TCZ QW (75%), TCZ Q2W (74%), PBO + 26 wk (76%), and PBO + 52 wk (65%) treatment groups.

The rates of infections were comparable between the TCZ and placebo groups in Study WA28119. Overall, the rates of infections were higher in Study WA28119 (Part 1) compared with the LTE All-exposure RA population.

The most common types of infections across all treatment groups were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, and urinary tract infection. Dose interruption because of infections occurred in 18% of patients in the TCZ QW group, 14% of patients in the TCZ Q2W group, 14% of patients in the PBO + 26 wk group, and 20% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group.

## Serious infections (including opportunistic infections)

Serious infections were reported in 7% (7/100) of patients in the TCZ QW group, 4% (2/49) of patients in the TCZ Q2W group, 4% (2/50) of patients in the PBO + 26 wk group, and 12% (6/51) of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group. This was reflected in the rates of serious infections (including opportunistic infections) in the TCZ groups that were also numerically lower compared with the placebo groups but with overlapping CIs.

The rates of opportunistic infections were comparable between the TCZ and placebo groups

In MarketScan, individual events are counted only once in each patient over 52 weeks; therefore number of patients and number of events are same.

Only serious opportunistic infections are included in the Marketscan data because non-serious opportunitistic infections are not easily captured of validatedaspartofhealthinsuranceclaimsdataintheMarketScandatabase.

The serious infection events of gastroenteritis and herpes zoster were both observed in 2 patients each in the PBO + 52 wk group. All other serious infections were single occurrences. Three urinary tract-related serious events (urinary tract infection, urosepsis, and pyelonephritis) were reported in a single patient.

Opportunistic infections were reported in 2 patients in the PBO + 52 wk group (Grade 3 genital herpes zoster and Grade 1 cytomegalovirus infection) and 1 patient in the TCZ Q2W group (Grade 1 oropharyngeal candidiasis)

In addition to the opportunistic infections defined by the Roche AEGT basket, the sponsor performed a manual review of additional potential opportunistic infections reported in the Infections and Infestations SOC ('herpes zoster' and 'tuberculosis'). Herpes zoster was reported in 5 patients (5.0%) in the TCZ QW group, 2 patients (4.1%) in the TCZ Q2W group, 0 patients in the PBO + 26 wk group and 2 patients (3.9%) in the PBO + 52 wk group. Most of these events were non-serious, Grade 2 events, which did not result in a change to study treatment.

There were no reports of tuberculosis in study WA28119.

Hypersensitivity reactions are not easily captured or validated in health insurance claims data.

For hypersensitivity events, output only contains adverse events which are defined as occurring during or within 24 hours of an infusion/injection of study medication, and not deemed *unrelated\" to trial treatment.

The rates of potential hypersensitivity reactions were comparable between the TCZ and placebo groups in Study WA28119 (see table 28). The rates of potential hypersensitivity reactions were higher in Study WA28119 (Part 1) compared with the LTE All-exposure RA population. However, the rates in Study WA28119 (Part 1) are based on only 52 events and low exposure, the 95% CI for the rates are wide and often overlapping between the two populations.

- Analysis of adverse events in single case reports of patients with GCA Treated with IV tocilizumab

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## outside of clinical trials

Of the 105 case reports reviewed none were published with a primary focus on safety of TCZ. No AEs were reported following treatment with IV TCZ for the majority of patients, and safety data were not provided for a few cases in these published reports. The nature of the events reported was consistent with the established safety profile of TCZ. Four deaths were reported due to myocardial infarction, septic shock, stroke, and sepsis (Toussirot et al. 2016).

## Laboratory findings

## Study WA28119 (52 weeks double blind treatment)

Decreases from baseline were observed in mean and median neutrophil and platelet counts.

Neutropenia (including 'decreased neutrophil count') was reported as an AE in 4 patients in the TCZ QW group and 2 patients in the TCZ Q2W group. One patient with neutropenia in the TCZ QW group was withdrawn from all study treatment because of the event. An additional 2 patients in the TCZ QW group, had a TCZ study treatment dose interruption/modification due to neutropenia. Review of the clinical listings showed that there was no association between Grade 3 or 4 events of neutropenia and serious infections.

Thrombocytopenia (including platelet count decreased) was reported as an AE in 2 patients in the TCZ Q2W group. Neither patient was withdrawn from study treatment because of the event. One patient (255731/11201) had a TCZ study treatment dose interruption/modification due to both platelet count decreased and ALT increased. Both events were Grade 1 in severity and resolved without sequelae.

Neither of the thrombocytopenia events was associated with a bleeding event.

Notable changes from baseline were observed for liver (ALT, AST) and lipid (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol) parameters as well as glycated haemoglobin (Hb A1c). No clinically relevant changes over time were observed for other serum chemistry parameters.

'Alanine aminotransferase increased' was reported as an AE in 5 patients in the TCZ QW group, and 2 patients in each of the TCZ Q2W and PBO + 26 wk groups. 'Aspartate aminotransferase increased' was reported as an AE in 4 patients in the TCZ QW group, and 1 patient in each of the TCZ Q2W and PBO + 26 wk groups. No patients were withdrawn from study treatment because of these AEs. However, TCZ study treatment dose interruptions/modifications due to these AEs were reported for 4 patients in the TCZ QW group, 1 patient in the TCZ Q2W group.

'Hepatic enzyme increased' was reported as an AE in 4 patients in the TCZ QW group and 2 patients in the PBO + 52 wk group. One event of 'hepatic enzyme increased' in the PBO + 52 wk group was reported as a SAE (Grade 4) and led to TCZ study treatment interruption. None of the other events led to treatment withdrawal or study treatment interruption.

No AEs associated with other serum chemistry parameters (i.e., total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and lipids) were reported in the study.

## Immunogenicity

The anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay applied in the TCZ development program is a quasi-quantitative assay, in which ADA levels were determined against a calibration curve generated from an anti-TCZ antibody positive control. The 'relative ADA concentration' is provided in table 35 below for those GCA patients who developed ADA during the study.

Overall, the proportions of patients who developed treatment-induced ADA were low across treatment groups. No effects of ADA on safety, efficacy, or PK were observed

## Safety in special populations

No safety analyses based on demographic and other intrinsic factors (age, gender, race, weight, BMI, medical history) were performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

There was no formal drug-drug interaction measurements carried out during GiACTA and ML25676 studies.

Potential indirect effect of TCZ on the expression of CYP3A4 metabolising enzyme and a consequent increased elimination of prednisone is discussed in the Clinical Pharmacology subsection of this AR.

In Study WA28119 11 patients (11%) in the TCZ QW group, 5 patients (10%) in the TCZ Q2W group, 3 patients (6%) in the PBO + 26 wk group and no patient in the PBO + 52 wk group experienced ARs leading the withdrawal. No individual AE preferred term was reported by more than 1 patient in any treatment group

The most common AEs that resulted in withdrawal of study treatment in the LTE all-exposure RA population were associated with the Infections and Infestations.

## Phase II investigator-initiated trial ML25676

Three patients were withdrawn from treatment prior to Week 12 due to AEs (1 patient, TCZ group) and SAEs (1 patient each in the TCZ and placebo groups).

## Post marketing experience

TCZ is currently approved worldwide for the treatment of RA (IV and SC formulations), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (IV formulation), and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (IV formulation). In India and Japan, TCZ has an additional indication for treatment in Castleman's disease (IV formulation).

Since the IBD (11 April 2005) to 10 April 2016, an estimated cumulative total of 664,900 patients (522,482 PY) have received TCZ from marketing experience. The cumulative post-marketing exposure to SC TCZ is 92,216 patients (74,669 PY).

Cumulatively up to 10 April 2016, a total of 154,459 events had been recorded on the Company Global Safety Database. Of these, 42,797 events were considered as SAEs. The most common AEs ( ≥ 10%) from post-marketing sources were within the SOCs of Infections and Infestations (16.4%); General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (15.7%), Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (11.7%), and Investigations (10%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety profile of SC TCZ (with the exception of ISRs, which were more common with SC TCZ) was comparable with the safety profile of IV TCZ. No new or unexpected adverse drug reactions were observed with the SC formulation.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The clinical safety data supporting this application are derived primarily from the pivotal study WA28119. Data from 250 patients treated for 52 weeks (Part 1) period and interim data from 88 patients in the LTE phase (Part 2) who had at least 100 weeks of follow up are included in the safety data base. The data base is further supported by results from a Phase II investigator-initiated trial (ML25676), studying intravenous (IV) TCZ in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing GCA; pooled long-term safety data with IV TCZ in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population, which included 4171 patients, and analysis of adverse events (AEs) reported in single case reports of patients with GCA treated with IV TCZ outside of clinical trials. As reference background rates of adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and glucocorticoid- induced toxicity information from an epidemiological analysis of the MarketScan health claims database are included in the submission. Although the clinical trial database for GCA is small, given the long experience with TCZ IV and TCZ SC formulation, this is considered acceptable by CHMP.

In Part 1 of study WA28119 most patients in the study experienced at least one AE, with the proportion of such patients ranging between 92.2% and 98.0% across treatment groups. The number of individual events were numerically lower in the TCZ treatment groups (470 events in the PBO + 26 wk group and 486 in the PBO + 52 wk groups vs 432 events in the TCZ Q2W group and 810 events in TCZ QW [which included twice as many patients than the other groups]). This translates into numerically higher rates of 990.8 AEs [95% CI: 903.19, 1084.5] or 1011.2 [95% CI: 923.31, 1105.3] AEs per 100 patient years (PY) in the PBO + 26 wk and PBO + 52 wk groups, respectively, versus 872.0 AEs [95% CI: 813.00, 934.21] or 948.0 [95% CI: 860.67, 1041.7] AEs per 100 PY in the TCZ QW and Q2W groups, respectively.

The percentage of patients who experienced at least one AE during the 52 week double-blind study period was comparable between the different treatment groups. The SOC with the highest incidence of all-grade AE reporting was infections and infestations. The next highest incidence was in the Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders SOC.

The SAE rate per 100 PY of exposure was numerically lower in both TCZ arms (29.1 [95% CI: 19.2, 42.3] events per 100 PY in the TCZ QW group and 21.9 [95% CI: 10.5, 40.4] events per 100 PY in the TCZ Q2W group) compared with the placebo arms (31.6 [95% CI: 17.7, 52.2] events per 100 PY in the PBO + 26 wk group), with the highest AE rate occurring in the PBO + 52 wk group (43.7 [95% CI: 27.0, 66.8] events per 100 PY). No deaths were reported during Part 1 of Study WA28119.

For several of the pre-specified AESI categories i.e. anaphylaxis, serious bleeding, serious myocardial infarction, serious gastrointestinal perforation, serious hepatic events, serious demyelinating events, there were no events observed in the trial.

The rates of infections, serious infections, injection site reactions, hypersensitivity reactions and stroke were low and occurred with comparable frequency in all treatment groups.

The rates of malignancies were numerically lower in the TCZ groups compared with the placebo groups, but with overlapping CIs. Overall, the rates of AESIs were lower in Study WA28119 (Part 1) compared with the reported rates in the GCA cohort from the MarketScan database. Of note, ICD-9 codes used for extracting AESIs from the MarketScan database may not map exactly with the MedDRA codes used in Study WA28119 (Part 1), hence no direct comparisons should be made.

Decreases from baseline were observed in mean and median neutrophil and platelet counts. Neutropenia (including 'decreased neutrophil count') was reported as an AE in 4 patients in the TCZ QW group and 2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients in the TCZ Q2W group. Review of the clinical listings showed that there was no association between Grade 3 or 4 events of neutropenia and serious infections. Thrombocytopenia (including platelet count decreased) was reported as an AE in 2 patients in the TCZ Q2W group. Neither of the thrombocytopenia events was associated with a bleeding event.

No safety analyses based on demographic and other intrinsic factors (age, gender, race, weight, BMI, medical history) were performed.

Events that are consistent with glucocorticoid-induced toxicity from Part 1 of Study WA28119 were analysed retrospectively using criteria that were developed by the Sponsor prior to database lock. In Study WA28119, during the 52-week double-blind phase (Part 1), the proportion of patients who experienced any potentially glucocorticoid-induced toxicity events was numerically lower in both the TCZ groups (21.0% in TCZ QW and 18.4% in TCZ Q2W) compared with the placebo groups (28.0% in PBO + 26 wk and 29.4% in PBO + 52 wk). It should be noted that these data from Study WA28119 were analysed retrospectively and were not based on standard or pre-specified criteria. Additionally, the duration of the study was considered too short for some of these events to manifest.

The MarketScan data analysis showed a statistically significant increase in the likelihood (odds ratio = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.29) of patients experiencing any glucocorticoid-related event associated with each 1 gram increase in cumulative glucocorticoid dose in the first year following diagnosis with GCA.

The proportion of AEs leading to withdrawal from TCZ/placebo treatment was 6.0% in the PBO + 26wk group and 11.0% and 10.2% in the TCZ groups. There were no such events in the PBO + 52wk group.

Data from the LTE phase (Part 2) of study WA28119 as well as data from the investigator-initiated trial (ML25676) are consistent with the data from Part 1 of study WA28119. Importantly no signals were observed in Part 2 of the study which precludes treatment beyond week 52.

These results demonstrate that the safety profile of TCZ SC (QW and Q2W) in GCA is comparable with the known the known safety profile in RA.

Background AESI rates and glucocorticoid induced toxicity in GCA (in absence of TCZ exposure) from the MarketScan analysis are presented to contextualize rates reported with TCZ treatment in Study WA28119 for some AESIS, overall, the rates of AESIs were lower in Study WA28119 (Part 1) compared with the reported rates in the GCA cohort from the MarketScan database.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety profile of TCZ 162 mg SC (QW and Q2W) in GCA is in line with the known safety profile in RA and no new safety concerns were identified.

The safety profile in the placebo groups was less favourable than in the i.e. a higher SAE rate was reported in the placebo groups.

The favourable safety profile of TCZ in GCA patients was also confirmed evaluating background AESI rates and glucocorticoid induced toxicity in GCA (in absence of TCZ exposure) from the MarketScan. These data indicate that rates of AESIs were lower in Study WA28119 (Part 1) compared with the reported rates in the GCA cohort from the MarketScan database.

|                  | (see section 4.8, Undesirable Effects). TCZ treatment should not be initiated in patients with active infections (see section 4.3). Administration of TCZ should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious infection until the infection is controlled (see section 4.8). Healthcare professionals should exercise caution when considering the use of TCZ in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions (e.g. diverticulitis, diabetes, and interstitial lung disease which may predispose patients to infections. Vigilance for the timely detection of serious infection is recommended for patients receiving biological treatments for moderate to severe RA, sJIA or pJIA as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened, associated with suppression of the acute phase reaction. The effects of tocilizumab on C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils and signs and symptoms of infection should be considered when evaluating a patient for a potential infection. Patients (which includes younger children with sJIA or pJIA who may be less able to communicate their symptoms) and parents/guardians of sJIA or pJIA patients, should be instructed to contact their healthcare professional immediately when any symptoms suggesting infection appear, in order to assure rapid evaluation and appropriate treatment. Tuberculosis As recommended for other biological treatments, RA, sJIA and pJIA patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to starting TCZ therapy. Patients with latent TB should be treated with standard anti-mycobacterial therapy before initiating TCZ. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin and interferon-gamma TB blood test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever) suggestive of a tuberculosis infection occur during or after therapy with TCZ..

Reported serious infections, some with fatal outcome, included active tuberculosis, which may present with intrapulmonary or extrapulmonary disease, invasive pulmonary infections, including candidiasis, aspergillosis, coccidioidomycosis and pneumocystis jirovecii, pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis and bacterial arthritis. Cases of opportunistic infections have been reported. Interstitial Lung Disease Impaired lung function may increase the risk for developing infections. There have been postmarketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of which had fatal outcomes. Paediatric population sJIA : Infections In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of all infections in the tocilizumab group was 344.7 per 100 patient years and 287.0 per 100 patient years in the placebo group. In the ongoing open label extension phase (Part II), the overall rate of infections remained similar at 306.6 per 100 patient years. In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of serious infections in the tocilizumab group was 11.5 per 100 patient years. At one year in the ongoing open label extension phase the overall rate of serious infections remained stable at 11.3 per 100 patient years. Reported serious infections were similar to those seen in RA patients with the addition of varicella and otitis media. pJIA: Infections The rate of infections in the tocilizumab all exposure population was 163.7 per 100 patient years. The most common events observed were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections. The rate of serious infections was numerically higher in patients weighing <30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (12.2 per 100 patient years) compared to patients weighing ≥ 30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (4.0 per 100 patient years). The incidence of infections leading to dose interruptions was also numerically higher in patients weighing <30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (21.4%) compared to patients weighing ≥ 30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (7.6%).

Patient Information Leaflet: IV Formulation : Section 2. What you need to know before you are given TCZ • You are not to be given TCZ o if you have an active, severe infection. SC Formulation: Section 2. What you need to know before you use TCZ • Do not use TCZ o if you have an active, severe infection. IV/SC Formulation Warnings and Precautions If you have any kind of infection, short- or long-term, or if you often get infections. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel unwell. TCZ can reduce your body's ability to respond to infections and may make an existing infection worse or increase the chance of getting a new infection. If you have had tuberculosis, tell your doctor. Your doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting TCZ. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately.

| Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions | SPC SPC Section 4.8 Undesirable effects: Infusion Reactions In the 6-month controlled trials adverse events associated with infusion (selected events occurring during or within 24 hours of infusion) were reported by 6.9% of patients in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARD group and 5.1% of patients in the placebo plus DMARD group. Events reported during the infusion were primarily episodes of hypertension; events reported within 24 hours of finishing an infusion were headache and skin reactions (rash, urticaria). These events were not treatment limiting. The rate of anaphylactic reactions (occurring in a total of 8/4,009 patients, 0.2%) was several fold higher with the 4 mg/kg dose, compared to the 8 mg/kg dose. Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment discontinuation were reported in a total of 56 out of 4,009 patients (1.4%) treated with tocilizumab during the controlled and open label clinical studies. These reactions were generally observed during the second to fifth infusions of tocilizumab (see section 4.4). Fatal anaphylaxis has been reported after marketing authorisation during treatment with intravenous [IV Formulation only] tocilizumab (see section 4.4).

|                  | Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis have been reported in association with TCZ (see section 4.8). Such reactions may be more severe, and potentially fatal in patients who have experienced hypersensitivity reactions during previous treatment with tocilizumab even if they have received premedication with steroids and antihistamines. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of TCZ should be stopped immediately, and appropriate therapy initiated and tocilizumab should be permanently discontinued. SPC Section 4.8 Undesirable effects Paediatric population sJIA : Infusion Reactions Infusion related reactions are defined as all events occurring during or within 24 hours of an infusion. In the 12 week controlled phase, 4% of patients from the tocilizumab group experienced events occurring during infusion. One event (angioedema) was considered serious and life threatening, and the patient was discontinued from study treatment. In the 12 week controlled phase, 16% of patients in the tocilizumab group and 5.4% of patients in the placebo group experienced an event within 24 hours of infusion. At week 260, 12 patients had experienced 16 events during infusion giving a rate of events of 4.4 per 100 patient years. In the tocilizumab group, the events included, but were not limited to rash, urticaria, diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, arthralgia and headache. One of these events, urticaria, was considered serious. Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment discontinuation, were reported in 1 out of 112 patients (< 1%) treated with tocilizumab during the controlled and up to and including the open label clinical trial. pJIA: Infusion Reactions In pJIA patients, infusion related reactions are defined as all events occurring during or within 24 hours of an infusion. In the tocilizumab all exposure population, 11 patients (5.9%) experienced infusion reactions during the infusion and 38 patients (20.2%) experienced an event within 24 hours of an infusion. The most common events occuring during infusion were headache, nausea and hypotension and within 24 hours of infusion were dizziness and hypotension. In general, the adverse drug reactions observed during or within 24 hours of an infusion were similar in nature to those seen in RA and sJIA patients, see section 4.8.

| Neutropenia      | SPC section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Haematological abnormalities Decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts have occurred following treatment with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in combination with MTX (see section 4.8). There may be an increased risk of neutropenia in patients who have previously been treated with a TNF antagonist. In patients not previously treated with TCZ, initiation is not recommended in patients with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 2 x 10 9 /L. Caution should be exercised when considering initiation of TCZ treatment in patients with a low platelet count (i.e. platelet count below 100 x 10 3 / μL). In patients who develop an ANC < 0.5 x 10 9 /L or a platelet count < 50 x 10 3 /μL, continued treatment is not recommended. Severe neutropenia may be associated with an increased risk of serious infections, although there has been no clear association between decreases in neutrophils and the occurrence of serious infections in clinical trials with TCZ to date. In RA and GCA patients, neutrophils and platelets should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and thereafter according to standard clinical practice. For recommended dose modifications based on ANC and platelet counts, see section 4.2.

SPC Section 4.8 Undesirable effects/Laboratory evaluations Haematological abnormalities RA Patients Neutrophils In the 6-month controlled trials decreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 10 9 /L occurred in 3.4% of patients on tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs compared to < 0.1% of patients on placebo plus DMARDs. Approximately half of the patients who developed an ANC < 1 x 10 9 /L did so within 8 weeks after starting therapy. Decreases below 0.5 x 10 9 /L were reported in 0.3% patients receiving tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs. Infections with neutropenia have been reported. During the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of decreases in neutrophil counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical trials. Paediatric population pJIA Patients Neutrophils During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, a decrease in neutrophil count below1× 10 9 /L occurred in 25% of patients. sJIA Patients Neutrophils During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, a decrease in neutrophil counts below 1 x 10 9 /L occurred in 7%of patients in the tocilizumab group, and no decreases in the placebo group. In the ongoing open label extension phase, decreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 10 9 /L, occurred in 15% of the tocilizumab group. GCA Patients Neutrophils During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab 12-month controlled clinical trial, a decrease in neutrophil count below 1 × 10 9 /L occurred in 4% of patients in the tocilizumab subcutaneous weekly group.

| and the potential risk of bleeding | SPC section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use RA Haematological abnormalities Decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts have occurred following treatment with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in combination with MTX (see section 4.8). There may be an increased risk of neutropenia in patients who have previously been treated with a TNF antagonist. In RA patients, neutrophils and platelets should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and thereafter according to standard clinical practice. For recommended dose modifications based on ANC and platelet counts, see section 4.2. GCA Haematological abnormalities In GCA patients, neutrophils and platelets should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and thereafter according to standard clinical practice. For recommended dose modifications based on ANC and platelet counts (see section 4.2). SPC Section 4.8 Undesirable effects Haematological abnormalities Platelets In the 6-month controlled trials decreases in platelet counts below 100 x 10 3 / μl occurred in 1.7% of patients on tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs compared to < 1% on placebo plus DMARDs. These decreases occurred without associated bleeding events. During the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of decreases in platelet counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical trials. GCA Haematological abnormalities Platelets During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab 12 month controlled clinical trial, one patient (1%, 1/100) in the tocilizumab subcutaneous weekly group had a single transient occurence of decrease in platelet count to <100 × 10 3 / μL without associated bleeding events.

| Liver Enzyme and Bilirubin Elevations and Potential Risk of Hepatotoxicity | SPC SPC section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use RA Active hepatic disease and hepatic impairment Treatment with TCZ, particularly when administered concomitantly with MTX, may be associated with elevations in hepatic transaminases, therefore, caution should be exercised when considering treatment of patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Hepatic transaminase elevations In clinical trials, transient or intermittent mild and moderate elevations of hepatic transaminases have been reported commonly with TCZ treatment, without progression to hepatic injury (see section 4.8). An increased frequency of these elevations was observed when potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) were used in combination with TCZ. When clinically indicated, other liver function tests including bilirubin should be considered. Caution should be exercised when considering initiation of TCZ treatment in patients with elevated ALT or AST > 1.5 x ULN. In patients with baseline ALT or AST > 5 x ULN, treatment is not recommended. In RA patients, ALT and AST levels should be monitored every 4 to 8 weeks for the first 6 months of treatment followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. For recommended modifications based on transaminases see section 4.2. For ALT or AST elevations > 3-5 x ULN, confirmed by repeat testing, TCZ treatment should be interrupted. GCA Hepatic transaminase elevations In GCA patients, ALT and AST levels should be monitored every 4 to 8 weeks for the first 6 months of treatment followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. For recommended modifications based on transaminases see section 4.2. For ALT or AST elevations > 3-5 x ULN, confirmed by repeat testing, TCZ treatment should be interrupted.

|                  | Hepatic transaminase elevations During the 6-month controlled trials transient elevations in ALT/AST > 3 x ULN were observed in 2.1% of patients on tocilizumab 8 mg/kg compared to 4.9% of patients on MTX and in 6.5% of patients who received 8 mg/kg tocilizumab plus DMARDs compared to 1.5% of patients on placebo plus DMARDs. The addition of potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) to tocilizumab monotherapy resulted in increased frequency of these elevations. Elevations of ALT/AST > 5 x ULN were observed in 0.7% of tocilizumab monotherapy patients and 1.4% of tocilizumab plus DMARD patients, the majority of whom were discontinued permanently from tocilizumab treatment. These elevations were not associated with clinically relevant increase in direct bilirubin, nor were they associated with clinical evidence of hepatitis or hepatic impairment. During the double-blind controlled period, the incidence of indirect bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal, collected as a routine laboratory parameter, is 6.2% in patients treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab + DMARD. A total of 5.8% of patients experienced an elevation of indirect bilirubin of > 1 to 2 x ULN and 0.4% had an elevation of > 2 x ULN. During the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of elevation in ALT/AST remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical trials. GCA Hepatic transaminase elevations During routine laboratory monitoring in the TCZ 12 month controlled clinical trial, elevation in ALT ≥3 x ULN occurred in 3% of patients in the TCZ SC QW compared to 2% in the placebo plus 52 week prednisone taper group and none in the placebo plus 26 week prednisone taper group. An elevation in AST > 3 ULN occurred in 1% of patients in the TCZ SC QW group, compared to no patients in either of the placebo plus prednisone taper groups.

In the majority of patients, there was no increase in atherogenic indices, and elevations in total cholesterol responded to treatment with lipid lowering agents. RA Patients In RA patients, assessment of lipid parameters should be performed 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of TCZ therapy. Patients should be managed according to local clinical guidelines for management of hyperlipidaemia. Cardiovascular Risk RA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders and should have risk factors (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) managed as part of usual standard of care. GCA Patients In GCA patients, assessment of lipid parameters should be performed 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of TCZ therapy. Patients should be managed according to local clinical guidelines for management of hyperlipidaemia.

Two patients developed positive anti-tocilizumab antibodies with one of these patients having a hypersensitivity reaction leading to withdrawal. The incidence of anti-tocilizumab antibody formation might be underestimated because of interference of tocilizumab with the assay and higher drug concentration observed in children compared to adults. pJIA Patients One patient in the 10 mg/kg < 30kg group developed positive anti-tocilizumab antibodies without developing a hypersensitivity reaction and subsequently withdrew from the study. |                                         |

| CYP450 enzyme normalization                   | Routine risk minimization by means of labelling: SPC SPC section 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. Concomitant administration of a single dose of 10 mg/kg tocilizumab with 10-25 mg MTX once weekly had no clinically significant effect on MTX exposure. Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of MTX, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids on tocilizumab clearance in RA patients. In the GCA patients, no effect of cumulative corticosteroid dose on TCZ exposure was observed. The expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by the cytokines, such as IL-6, that stimulate chronic inflammation. Thus, CYP450 expression may be reversed when potent cytokine inhibitory therapy, such as tocilizumab,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | None proposed                           |

|                  | is introduced. In vitro studies with cultured human hepatocytes demonstrated that IL-6 caused a reduction in CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzyme expression. Tocilizumab normalises expression of these enzymes. In a study in RA patients, levels of simvastatin (CYP3A4) were decreased by 57% one week following a single dose of tocilizumab, to the level similar to, or slightly higher than, those observed in healthy subjects. When starting or stopping therapy with tocilizumab, patients taking medicinal products which are individually adjusted and are metabolised via CYP450 3A4, 1A2, 2C9 or 2C19 (e.g. atorvastatin, calcium channel blockers, theophylline, warfarin, phenprocoumon, phenytoin, ciclosporin, or benzodiazepines) should be monitored as doses may need to be increased to maintain therapeutic effect. Given its long elimination half-life (t 1/2 ), the effect of tocilizumab on CYP450 enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy.

The recommended posology is 8 mg/kg once every 2 weeks in patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or 12 mg/kg once every 2 weeks in patients weighing less than 30 kg. The dose should be calculated based on the patient's body weight at each administration. A change in dose should only be based on a consistent change in the patient's body weight over time. Dose interruptions of tocilizumab for the following laboratory abnormalities are recommended in sJIA patients in the tables below. If appropriate, the dose of concomitant MTX and/or other medications should be modified or dosing stopped and tocilizumab dosing interrupted until the clinical situation has been evaluated. As there are many co-morbid conditions that may affect laboratory values in sJIA, the decision to discontinue tocilizumab for a laboratory abnormality should be based upon the medical assessment of the individual | None proposed                                                                                                               |

Approximately one-third of the patients in the GCA study had moderate renal impairment at baseline (estimated creatinine clearance of 30-59 mL/min). No impact on TCZ exposure was noted in these patients. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. | None proposed                           |

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a bridging report making reference to RoActemra 162 mg solution for subcutaneous injection in a pre-filled syringe. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

RoActemra is indicated for the treatment of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) in adult patients.

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

Glucocorticoids (GC) are the mainstay of treatment for GCA and are typically administered in the form of oral prednisone/prednisolone, although some physicians use pulsed intravenous (IV) glucocorticoids in patients presenting with visual loss. Although glucocorticoids are highly effective at inducing remission of systemic inflammation and preventing acute damage (e.g., blindness), this comes with a high toxicity burden, with approximately 80% of patients suffering GC-related adverse clinical events at 10-year follow-up (Proven et al. 2003). In addition, GC are not as effective at maintaining remission, with many patients (up to 50%) experiencing relapse or flare-up of symptoms during reduction or discontinuation of glucocorticoids (Proven et al. 2003). Other agents, including azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate (MTX), infliximab, and etanercept, have shown conflicting or no evidence of benefit in the treatment of GCA. Also, MTX is used inconsistently as standard of care for glucocorticoid-sparing in relapsing patients. More recently, limited efficacy in the treatment of GCA has been demonstrated with the use of combination treatment with abatacept and prednisone (Langford et al. 2015).

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

Data to support the efficacy of tocilizumab (also known as RO4877533 and TCZ) in adult patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA or temporal arteritis) are provided from the pivotal Phase III trial (Study WA28119; GiACTA). Study WA28119 was designed to evaluate the efficacy of TCZ plus glucocorticoid treatment compared to treatment with glucocorticoids alone in new-onset and relapsing patients with GCA, as well as to evaluate the safety profile of TCZ treatment in this patient population. The study includes a 52-week blinded period (Part 1) followed by a 104-week open-label period (Part 2), with a total study duration of 156 weeks.

## 3.2. Favourable effects

The primary endpoint, superiority of each of the TCZ arms (with 26 week prednisone tapering) over PBO with 26 week tapering, was met. Sustained remission at Week 52 was achieved in 56.0% of patients in the TCZ QW group, 53.1% of patients in the TCZ Q2W group and 14.0% of patients in the PBO + 26 wk group. The difference in the percentage of responders between the TCZ QW group and placebo was 42.0% (99.5% CI: 18.0 to 66.0), with an associated p-value of &lt; 0.0001. The difference in the percentage of responders between the TCZ Q2W dose group and placebo was 39.1% (99.5% CI: 12.5 to 65.7), with a p-value of &lt; 0.0001.

The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in sustained remission at Week 52 in the TCZ groups in combination with a 26-week prednisone taper compared with placebo in combination with a 52-week prednisone taper. Both the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W dose groups met non-inferiority. In post hoc analyses subsequently superiority to placebo was shown with regard to the key secondary endpoint. Sustained remission at Week 52 was achieved by 56.0% of patients in the TCZ QW group, 53.1% of patients in the TCZ Q2W group and 17.6% of patients in the PBO + 52 wk group. The difference in the percentage of responders in the TCZ QW group versus the PBO + 52 wk group was 38.4% (99.5% CI: 17.9 to 58.8) and the difference in the percentage of responders in the TCZ Q2W group versus the PBO + 52 wk group was 35.4% (99.5% CI: 10.4 to 60.4). The lower boundaries of the 99.5% CIs for both TCZ dose groups were greater than the non-inferiority margin of -22.5%, meeting the criteria for non-inferiority.

A statistically significantly lower cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 in both the TCZ QW and TCZ Q2W treatment groups in combination with a 26 week prednisone taper period when compared to placebo was reported.

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

The effect on entire course of GCA episode including early remission which should be the primary goal of any GCA treatment could not be evaluated with the current protocol.

TCZ monotherapy was not investigated in the clinical studies.

Data from the LTE part of study WA28119 suggest that in the TCZ groups a higher incidence of flares were observed after stopped their TCZ treatment at 52 weeks than in the placebo groups. A rebound effect cannot be excluded.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effect

The unfavourable effects of TCZ in the treatment of patients with GCA are consistent with the known safety profile of TCZ and include infections, injection site reactions, immunogenicity, haematological abnormalities, decrease in platelet count, and elevation in hepatic transaminase and lipid parameters.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

The numbers of patients contributing to efficacy and safety in GCA patients are relative small.

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The primary endpoint of the sustained remission at week 52 is clinically meaningful. TCZ 162 mg SC QW and Q2W with 26 week prednisone tapering regimen was superior to placebo in combination with a 26 wk or 52 wk resp. prednisone tapering regime and are effective at maintaining remission in patients with GCA.

Uncertainties with regard to maintenance of the remission after week 52 i.e. after stopping TCZ regimen exist, since preliminary data from the LTE part might indicate a rebound. The final WA28119 study report will be submitted by Q4 2018, where a possible rebound effect can be further re-assessed based on new data. This long term data will allow a proper assessment of the long-term efficacy i.e. maintenance of efficacy and safety. The MAH has committed to state the lack of data in the RMP under missing information. The final CSR and updated RMP will be submitted by Q1 2019.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Effect on entire course of GCA episode including early remission which should be the primary goal of any GCA treatment could not be directly evaluated with the current protocol.

However, data from the WA28119 study demonstrate a superior treatment effect of TCZ at 52 weeks, but also show an impact on treatment response as early as Week 1 after initiation of TCZ treatment. Thus, the differences in efficacy across groups were present at the earliest possible time points for assessment. These exploratory findings provide evidence on the efficacy of TCZ in establishing early disease control, even though this was not the principal aim of study WA28119.

Importantly patients in both TCZ groups had a significantly lower cumulative prednisone consumption (including all taper prednisone, escape therapy and commercial concomitant prednisone) than patients in the placebo arms. The lower cumulative prednisone dose to Week 52 in both TCZ groups as compared to the placebo groups might have contributed to the more favourable safety profile under TCZ treatment (e.g. less SAE's) compared to placebo.

RoActemra is intended to be used in combination with a tapering course of glucocorticoids. However, RoActemra can be used alone following discontinuation of glucocorticoids. Appropriate guidance has been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC.

The favourable safety profile of TCZ in GCA patients was also confirmed evaluating background AESI rates and glucocorticoid induced toxicity in GCA (in absence of TCZ exposure) from the MarketScan. These data indicate that rates of AESIs were lower in Study WA28119 (Part 1) compared with the reported rates in the GCA cohort from the MarketScan database.

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

Sustained remission at week 52 was achieved under both TCZ regimens in combination with a 26 prednisone tapering regimen. TCZ was superior to placebo in combination with a 26 wk or 52 wk resp. prednisone tapering regime. Altogether the patients in both TCZ groups had a significant lower cumulative prednisone consumption (including all taper prednisone, escape therapy and commercial concomitant prednisone) than patients in the placebo arms. This contributes largely to a better safety profile in TCZ treated patients compared to patients treated with prednisone alone. Considering the age group of the target population (&gt; 50 years) the favourable safety profile is an important factor.

## 3.8. Conclusions

The overall B/R of RoActemra is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome
