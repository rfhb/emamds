## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for stiripentol, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on risk from clinical trial(s) and spontaneous reports, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between stiripentol and pneumonia is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing stiripentol should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for stiripentol the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing stiripentol is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
