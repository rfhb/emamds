The safety results provided in the PSURs since initial granting of the MAH do not indicate any other new safety signal or new adverse events, which are not covered in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

| II/0018 | Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to include the possible risk of epistaxis when using Altargo intra-nasally as requested by he CHMP after the assessment of PSUR 4th and 5th. Section 3 of the PL was updated accordingly. C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH product | 22/07/2010 no | 01/09/2010 | Following PSUR 4th and 5th the CHMP requested the MAH to submit a variation to update section 4.4 to include the risk of epistaxis when retapamulin is applied intra-nasally. Conclusions were based on one post-marketing report of epistaxis following intra-nasal use of retapamulin and referred also to a clinical trial in healthy volunteers (ALB110247) where epistaxis occurred more commonly in subjects who received retapamulin compared to placebo. Therefore this type II variation has been submitted to update section 4.4 of the SPC and section 3 of the PIL accordingly. The CHMP agreed that the changes proposed by the MAH in the SPC and PL were appropriate to the risks identified. |

| II/0012 | To update sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SPC to reflect data from a paediatric pharmacokinetics study, following the assessment of FU2 002.1. Section 2 of the PL was updated accordingly. The MAH took the opportunity to update the contact details of the company representative in Cyprus. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 21/01/2010 no | 17/03/2010 longer | SmPC and PL | The MAH has conducted a paediatric study to assess the pharmacokinetics of topical retapamulin. Results of this study have shown that in children aged from 9 months to 2 years it is possible that higher plasma concentrations may occasionally occur during treatment with retapamulin 1% ointment compared to older children and adults. Therefore caution is advised if retapamulin 1% ointment is administered to children in this age group who are also receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors, as further increase in systemic exposure to retapamulin may occur upon CYP3A4 inhibition. |
