## 1. Submission of the dossier

The applicant GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A. submitted on 22 December 2005 an application for Marketing  Authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMEA)  for  Daronrix,  through  the centralised  procedure  falling  within  the  Article  3(1)  and  point  1  of  Annex  of  Regulation  (EC)  No 726/2004.

The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur appointed by the CHMP were:

Medicinal product no longer authorised Licensing status: The product was not licensed in any country at the time of submission of the application. 2. Steps taken for the assessment of the product · Accelerated Assessment procedure was agreed-upon by CHMP on 15 December 2005. · The procedure started on 1 February 2006. · The Rapporteur's first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CHMP  Members  on  31  March 2006. The Co-Rapporteur's first assessment report was circulated to all CHMP Members on 10 April 2006. · The BWP discussed Daronrix during their meeting on 19-20 April 2006 and adopted an Interim BWP report to the CHMP. · During  the  meeting  on  24-27  April  2006,  the  CHMP  agreed  on  the  consolidated  List  of Questions to be sent to the applicant. The final consolidated List of Questions was sent to the applicant on 27 April 2006. · The company submitted the responses to the consolidated list of questions on 5 October 2006. · The Rapporteurs circulated the response assessment report on the company's responses to the list of questions to all CHMP Members on 15 November 2006. · The VWP discussed Daronrix during their  meeting on 28-30 November 2006 and adopted a Report to the CHMP. · The BWP discussed Daronrix during their meeting on 4-6 December 2006 and adopted a Report to the CHMP. · During  the  meeting  on  11-14  December  2006  the  CHMP,  in  the  light  of  the  overall  data submitted  and  the  scientific  discussion  within  the  Committee,  issued  a  positive  opinion  for granting a Marketing Authorisation under exceptional circumstances to Daronrix on 14 December 2006.

- On request of the European Commission, in order to increase clarity and transparency of the scientific reasoning behind the evaluation of Daronrix, the CHMP revised its Assessment report in  the  sections  on  conditions,  or  restrictions,  regarding  supply  and  use,  introduction,  overall conclusion  and  the  benefit-risk  assessment  and  the  recommendations.  The  Annex  II  of  the opinion  was  revised  to  reflects  that  Daronrix  can  only  be  marketed  when  there  is  an  official WHO/EU  declaration  of  an  influenza  pandemic  and  on  the  condition  that  the  Marketing Authorisation Holder takes due account of the officially declared pandemic strain. During the meeting  of  22-24  January  2007  the  CHMP  readopted  the  positive  opinion  for  granting  a Marketing Authorisation under exceptional circumstances to Daronrix on 24 January 2007.
- The CHMP opinions were forwarded, in all official languages of the European Union, to the European Commission, which adopted the corresponding Decisions on 21 March 2007.
