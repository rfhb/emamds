## STEPS TAKEN AFTER GRANTING THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION

## For procedures finalised after 1 July 2004 please refer to module 8B

On 30 April 1996 the European Commission issued a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for the medicinal product Humalog. This decision was based on the assessment report and on the favourable opinion adopted by the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) on 22 November 1995 for Humalog. Table N°1 summarise subsequent post Marketing Authorisation applications for Humalog issued by Commission Decision until 18 April 2001.

The company Eli Lilly B.V. Nederland submitted to the EMEA an application to extend the marketing authorisation,  concerning  Humalog (100 U/ml) 3.0 ml cartridge and Humalog-HumaJect (100U/ml) 3.0 ml cartridge in a disposable pen. The CPMP issued on 20 November 1996 a positive opinion for granting the marketing authorisation to Humalog 3.0 ml cartridge and to Humalog-HumaJect 3.0 ml cartridge  in  a  disposable  pen.  Table  N°2  summarise  subsequent  post  Marketing  Authorisation applications for Humalog-HumaJect issued by Commission Decision until 18 April 2001.

Eli Lilly B.V. Nederland submitted to the EMEA an application to extend the marketing authorisation for Humalog-HumaPen (100U/ml) 3.0 ml cartridge in a disposable pen. The CPMP issued a positive opinion  for  granting  the  marketing  authorisation  on  18  February  1997.  Table  N°3  summarise subsequent post Marketing Authorisation applications for Humalog-HumaPen issued by Commission Decision until 18 April 2001.

During  the  variation  EMEA/H/C/0088/II/23  for  Humalog  the  MAH  requested  to  combine  all  17 insulin lispro presentations of the Humalog, Humalog-HumaJect and Humalog Pen licences into the one core Humalog  licence (EU/1/96/007). Table N°4  summarise  subsequent post  Marketing Authorisation applications for all Humalog, Humalog-HumaJect and Humalog Pen licences.
