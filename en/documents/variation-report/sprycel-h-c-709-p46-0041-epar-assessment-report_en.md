## 1. Introduction

On 3 September 2015, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Sprycel in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

SPRYCEL  (dasatinib,  Bristol-Myers  Squibb  [BMS]-354825)  is  a  potent  oral  inhibitor  of  multiple oncogenic kinases and is approved for use in the European Union (EU), United States (US) and other countries  for  the  treatment  of  adult  subjects  with  chronic  phase  chronic  myeloid  leukemia  (CML), advanced (accelerated and blast) phase CML, or Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Dasatinib has also been approved in the EU, US, and other countries for treatment of adult subjects with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML. The recommended starting dosage for chronic phase CML is 100 mg administered orally once daily (QD).  The recommended starting dosage for accelerated phase CML, myeloid or lymphoid blast phase CML, or Ph+ ALL is 140 mg QD.

This submission includes results for the pediatric study CA180204 (EudraCT number 2010 022946-25) and is being submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006. A final clinical study report (CSR) is included in the submission and presents subject disposition, exposure, safety, and efficacy data. Study CA180204 started in 15-Jul-2008 and completed on 05-Mar-2015.

CA180204  is  a  completed,  open-label,  multi-center,  single-arm  Phase  2  study  conducted  and sponsored  by  the  Children's  Oncology  Group  (COG,  AALL0622)  assessing  the  addition  of  dasatinib administered QD to a multi agent chemotherapeutic 'backbone' in children with newly diagnosed Ph+ AL).  This  study  builds  on  the  experience  of  COG  AALL0031,  which  incorporated  imatinib,  a  tyrosine kinase  inhibitor  (TKI)  targeting  BCR-ABL,  into  an  intensive  chemotherapy  backbone  for  the  same population.  Compared  with  AALL0031,  the  treatment  plan  of  CA180204  substituted  dasatinib  for imatinib, and eliminated radiotherapy for the great majority of children.

Preliminary  data  from  this  CA180204  trial  prompted  development  of  study  CA180372,  in  which dasatinib is added to a Ph+ ALL chemotherapy regimen believed to be less intense than the AALL0031 chemotherapy  backbone.  The  chemotherapy  used  in  study  CA180372  is  based  on  the  Associazione Italiana di Ematologia Pediatrica - Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster ALL 2000 (AIEOP BFM 2000) study and amended  European  intergroup  study  on  post-induction  treatment  of  Philadelphia  positive  acute lymphoblastic leukemia (EsPhALL). Enrollment in study CA180204 was stopped on 3 Feb-2012 prior to reaching  enrollment  target  when  study  CA180372  opened  for  enrollment  of  the  same  patient population in COG.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study&lt;ies&gt;

The formulation used in the study was an oral tablet formulation. If necessary to permit administration in young children, the intact tablet could be placed, and allowed to dissolve, in 1 ounce of lemonade or preservative apple/orange juice.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

Study  CA180204  a  completed,  open-label,  multi-center,  single-arm  Phase  2  study  conducted  and sponsored by the Children ' s  Oncology  Group  (COG,  AALL0622) assessing the addition of dasatinib (Sprycel; BMS-354825) administered once daily (QD) to a multi-agent chemotherapeutic 'backbone ' in children from 1 years to less than 18 years of age (and adults) with newly-diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ AL)

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Description

Study CA180204 (COG AALL0622) is an open-label, multi-center, single-arm, Phase 2 study in children and young adults with newly diagnosed ALL. A primary objective of this study was to determine the feasibility and toxicity of an intensified chemotherapeutic regimen incorporating dasatinib for treatment of children and young adults with Ph+ ALL. Feasibility was defined as the ability to safely add dasatinib to  the  AALL0031  chemotherapy  backbone  either  when  given  discontinuously  (in  2-week  periods followed by 1 to 2 weeks off) or continuously. An additional primary objective was to estimate the 3year EFS for Standard-Risk Ph+ ALL subjects receiving dasatinib at the final chosen dose and intensive chemotherapy  plus  intensified  TKI  therapy.  A  benchmark  EFS  of  60%  (the  outcome  of  subjects receiving matched related bone marrow transplants from a large multicenter retrospective analysis), was used to evaluate outcome in this study.

A  design  schema  is  presented  in  Figure  1.1-1.  Subjects  entered  CA180204  on  or  before  Day  15  of Induction  therapy  (either  a  3-  or  4-drug  standard  Induction  or  on  a  Dana  Farber  Cancer  Institute [DFCI] Childhood ALL Consortium trial) and received dasatinib on Days 15 - 28 of Induction. Following Induction, all subjects received 2 blocks of Consolidation. Subjects in Cohort 1 (Safety Phase) received dasatinib  at  60 mg/m 2 daily  (DL0)  during  the  first  2  weeks  of  each  3-  to  4-week  post-Induction treatment  block  (discontinuous  dasatinib).  If  this  dose  was  well  tolerated,  the  subjects  in  Cohort  2 received continuous dasatinib treatment at 60 mg/m 2 /dose daily for the entire treatment block. (Note: If  60 mg/m 2 daily  were  not  well  tolerated,  subjects  in  Cohort  2  would  have  received  continuous dasatinib at 48 mg/m 2  daily [DL-1]). Subjects were enrolled into Cohort 2 once enrollment into Cohort 1  was  stopped.  Subjects  in  Cohort  1  (discontinuous  dasatinib)  received  a  total  of  70  weeks  of dasatinib. Subjects in Cohort 2 (continuous dasatinib) received a total of 128 weeks of dasatinib. See Figure 1.1-2 for schematic of safety phase.

Quantification of residual  disease at end of  Induction and end of Consolidation was used to classify subjects into risk groups. All High-Risk subjects and all Standard-Risk subjects with matched sibling donors were urged to proceed to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) at the end of Consolidation Block 2 on ASCT0431 or a successor COG transplant trial. All subjects who did not proceed to HSCT continued on CA180204 and received chemotherapy plus dasatinib.

Note:  Six subjects were evaluated beginning at DL0 (60 mg/m 2  daily), dose given discontinuously. If 2 or  more  of  the  6  subjects  had  unacceptable  delays,  then  the  dose  of  dasatinib  was  reduced  to 48 mg/m 2  daily (DL-1). An additional 6 subjects were then accrued at this lower dose level (DL-1). If ≥ 5/6 subjects safely completed Intensification Block 1 at a given dose level, Cohort 2 opened at DL0, with the dose given continuously. When a safe dose level was established, the efficacy phase of the trial  opened to accrual. Subjects treated at the established dose level during the safety phase were included in the analyses for the efficacy phase.

## Objectives

Primary objectives were:

- To  determine  the  feasibility  and  toxicity  of  an  intensified  chemotherapeutic  regimen  that incorporates dasatinib for treatment of children, adolescents, and young adults (up to age 30) with Ph+ ALL.
- To determine whether the intensification of TKI through the addition of dasatinib in Induction (Days 15-28) and substitution of dasatinib for imatinib during post-Induction therapy, in the context of intensive cytotoxic therapy (according to AALL0031) and a good early response to therapy, will lead to a 3-year EFS of at least 60% in subjects with Ph+ ALL.

## Secondary objectives were:

- To  determine  whether  the  addition  of  dasatinib  during  Induction  therapy  (Days  15-28)  will decrease levels of MRD present at end of Induction therapy as compared with COG AALL0031.
- To  determine  whether  early  intensified  TKI  therapy  (ie,  addition  of  dasatinib  on  days 15 through 28 of Induction) will lower end-Consolidation MRD levels as compared to subjects on COG AALL0031 that received imatinib in Consolidation Blocks 1 and 2 (Cohorts 3-5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- To  determine  the  overall  3-year  EFS  rate  for  the  whole  cohort  of  Standard-  and  High-Risk subjects treated with dasatinib.
- To  determine  the  long-term  effects  of  dasatinib  on  growth  and  development  and  bone metabolism.
- To assess BCR-ABL mutation status at time of diagnosis and progression/relapse.
- To assess overall survival (OS).

## Criteria for Evaluation

Safety  primary  endpoint: A  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  determine  the  feasibility  and toxicity  of  an  intensified  chemotherapeutic  regimen incorporating dasatinib for treatment of children and young adults with Ph+ ALL. Feasibility was defined as the ability to safely add dasatinib to the AALL0031 chemotherapy backbone either when given discontinuously (in 2-week periods followed by 1 to  2  weeks  off)  or  continuously.  Feasibility  of  administering  dasatinib  in  combination  with  cytotoxic chemotherapy  was assessed by examining 1) adverse event (AE) experience, 2) delays in administering the combination therapy (the occurrence of delays in each reporting period of greater than 14 days due to AEs was captured on case report forms), 3) impact on MRD levels at the end of Induction and end of Consolidation Block 2, and 4) effect on EFS.

Efficacy  primary  endpoint: An  additional  primary  objective  was  to  estimate  the  3-year  EFS  for Standard-Risk Ph+ ALL subjects receiving dasatinib and intensive chemotherapy plus intensified TKI therapy. EFS was defined as the time from entry on study until an event. Events for EFS were defined as any first of the following: 1) induction failure, 2) relapse at any site, 3) secondary malignancy, and 4) death. A bone marrow aspirate was utilized in determining EFS. A bone marrow assessment was performed for cytology, conventional cytogenetics, and MRD assessment. A bone marrow aspirate was to be performed as clinically indicated if relapse was suspected in order to document an event for the primary endpoint of this study.

## Statistical Considerations

Safety  analyses  were  based  on  All  Treated  Subjects  (all  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of dasatinib) and results are presented by cohort and across cohorts. The Efficacy Sample included all treated subjects with the exception of subjects considered ineligible based on study chair review, and the Pediatric Efficacy Sample included all treated pediatric subjects (&lt; 18 years) with the exception of subjects considered ineligible based on Study Chair review.

The primary efficacy endpoint was 3-year EFS rate in Standard-Risk Ph+ ALL subjects in Cohort 2. The primary  efficacy  objective  was  to  determine  if  in  this  group  a  3-year  EFS  rate  of  60%  could  be achieved. The rate of 3-year EFS was estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curve. A 1-sided 95% Wald confidence  interval  (CI)  for  3-year  EFS  rate  was  constructed.  A  lower  limit  of  the  1-sided  95%  CI greater than 55% was evidence of this combination therapy being effective, but it should be taken into consideration that the sample size assumed in the protocol was higher than the actual sample size. The overall 3-year EFS rate for the combined groups of Standard- and High-Risk subjects in Cohort 2 was also estimated.

Secondary endpoints were 1) to determine whether the addition of dasatinib during Induction therapy (Days  15-28)  decreases  levels  of  MRD  present  at  end  of  Induction  therapy  as  compared  with  COG AALL0031, and 2) to determine whether early intensified TKI therapy (ie, addition of dasatinib on days 15 through 28 of Induction) lowers end-Consolidation MRD levels as compared with subjects on COG AALL0031 that received imatinib in Consolidation Blocks 1 and 2 (Cohorts 3-5). A total of 72 subjects on Cohorts 1-5 of study AALL0031 had end of Induction MRD data of which 71% were MRD positive (MRD &gt; 0.01%). In addition, the MRD positive rate (at the 0.01% level) following Consolidation was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

around 16%, in Cohorts 3-5 of AALL0031. A 1-sided, 2 sample Z-test of proportions was performed (alpha=5%) to compare the proportion of MRD positive subjects from Cohort 2 Efficacy Sample at end of Induction to that in study AALL0031, and a 1-sample Z-test of proportions (alpha=5%, 1-sided test) was  used  to  compare  the  MRD  positive  rate  among  subjects  in  Cohort  2  with  MRD  data  at  end  of Consolidation Block 2 to 16%.

Kaplan-Meier plots and estimates of OS were provided based on Standard-Risk Cohort 2 subjects as well  as  by  cohort  and  across  cohorts.  BCR-ABL  mutation  status  was  analyzed  at  baseline  and  at disease progression or relapse for subjects that progress or relapse. Changes from baseline in height and weight z-scores (standardized based on World Health Organization selected pediatric parameters) at different time periods (baseline, year 1, year 2, year 3, and beyond year 3) were tabulated.

## Results

## Demographics and Baseline Disease Characteristics - All Treated Subjects

A total  of  63  subjects  were  enrolled  and  62  were  treated  (40  in  Cohort  1  and  22  in  Cohort  2).  As indicated above, accrual was less than originally planned because enrollment was stopped when study CA180372 opened for enrollment of this patient population as agreed with regulatory authorities.

Overall,  more  male  subjects  were  treated  compared  with  female  subjects  (67.7%  vs  32.3%, respectively),  and  the  majority  of  subjects  in  this  study  were  white  (71.0%)  (Table  1.2.1-1).  The median age at time of informed consent in all treated subjects was 8.0 years (range 1 - 27 years) in Cohort 1 and 10.0 years (range 1 - 27 years) in Cohort 2. At the age of diagnosis, 3 subjects were &gt; 1 - &lt; 2 years, and 7 subjects were ≥ 18 years. The remaining 52 subjects were diagnosed between the ages of 2 and &lt; 18 years.

The median time from initial diagnosis of ALL to the first dasatinib dosing date was 17 days overall (Table 1.2.1-2). The majority (93.5%) of subjects had B-precursor phenotype. The median white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts, and the median % blasts in bone marrow at baseline were:

- o WBC: 28.6 x 10 3 /µL (range 2.0 - 700 x 10 3 /µL)

- o Platelet: 64.0 x 10 3 /µL (range 5 - 45000 * x 10 3 /µL)

- o Blasts in bone marrow: 88.0% (range 38% - 100%)

* Note: Post database lock, this single value of 45000 was assumed to be a data entry error. Removal of the value of 45000 leads to the following results for platelets:

- -Cohort 1: N=39, Mean=90.9, Median=65, (Min, Max)=(5, 372), (Q1, Q3)=(29, 101), Standard Deviation=92.41
- -Cohort 2: N=12, Mean=96.3, Median=51, (Min, Max)=(11, 254), (Q1, Q3)=(23, 176), Standard Deviation=87.05
- -Total: N=51, Mean=92.2, Median=63, (Min, Max)=5, 372), (Q1, Q3)=(26, 134), Standard Deviation=90.35

Most subjects had central nervous system (CNS) 1 status (absence of blasts on cytospin preparation of cerebrospinal  fluid),  but  4  subjects  (6.5%,  3  in  Cohort  1  and  1 in  Cohort  2)  had  CNS3  status  at enrollment. No subjects were reported with testicular disease (or not applicable).

## Efficacy results

In the protocol for CA180204, the expected number of Standard-Risk Ph+ ALL Cohort 2 subjects (ie, the group on which the primary efficacy analysis is based) was expected to be 73; however, due to early closure of the study in order to open the successor study CA180372, the actual number was 17. The sample sizes for efficacy analyses in Cohort 2 are considerably lower than expected per protocol due to the early termination of enrollment. This negatively affects the power of statistical tests and the precision  of  estimates;  confidence  intervals  will  be  substantially  wider  than  under  the  expected numbers  of  subjects.  Therefore,  inferences  are  also  based  on  efficacy  information  from  Cohort  1 (discontinuous dosing) even though exposure to dasatinib was considerably less.

No  statistical  comparisons  were  performed  between  Cohorts  1  and  2.  These  subgroups  were  not randomized; rather, Cohort 2 subjects were enrolled after it was concluded that toxicity levels were acceptable in Cohort 1 subjects and enrollment into that cohort was closed.

## 3-year Event-free Survival

Cohort  2  subjects: The  primary efficacy endpoint was 3-year EFS rate in Standard-Risk Cohort 2 subjects. The proportion was estimated from the corresponding EFS Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 5.1-1). The primary efficacy objective was to determine if in this group a 3-year EFS rate of 60% could be achieved. The protocol states further that if the lower limit of the CI would be greater than 55%, the combination therapy should be deemed effective. The estimated 3-year EFS rate was 70.1%. However, the lower limit of the 1-sided 95% CI was 51.8% (Table 5.1-1). At the 3-year timepoint, a total of 5 events had been reported, 1 subject had been censored, and 11 subjects remained at risk.

In Cohort 2 subjects (Any Risk, Efficacy Sample [secondary endpoint]), the estimated 3-year EFS rate was 66.3% (N = 21) with a lower limit of the 1-sided 95% of 49.4% (Table 5.1-1). At the 3-year timepoint,  a  total  of  7  events  had  been  reported,  1  subject  had  been  censored,  and  13 subjects remained at risk.

Overall  for  subjects  in  Cohort  2  (Any  Risk,  Efficacy  Sample),  one  subject  relapsed  with  ALL  during study  treatment  (in  CNS,  after  21.7  months),  and  another  subject  developed  secondary  acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Two additional subjects experienced relapse after completion of protocol

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment.  Of  the  7  subjects  who  had  been  withdrawn  for  elective  BMT,  relapse  was  reported  in  3 subjects and death related to graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) in 1 subject. Error! Bookmark not defined.

## Long-term Effects of Dasatinib on Growth and Development and Bone Metabolism

Z-scores  decreased  over  time,  suggesting  that  growth  is  affected  in  pediatric  subjects  with  newly diagnosed  Ph+  ALL  following  the  treatment  strategy  in  this  study.  The  majority  of  the  data  were collected  while  on  treatment,  and  therefore,  data  are  not  mature  to  assess  longer  term  effects  of treatment.  Follow-up  in  subjects  for  the  measurement  of  growth-related  aspects  of  dasatinib  in combination with chemotherapy continues.

## Mutation Analysis

In All Treated Subjects who progressed or relapsed, 14/20 (70.0%) had mutation data at baseline and at the time of progression/relapse; of these subjects, 1 (7.1%) subject was reported with a mutation at baseline and 2 (14.3%) subjects were reported with a mutation at progression/relapse. One subject with a Q252H mutation identified at baseline developed a dasatinib-resistant T315I mutation on study, and one other subject developed a previously-uncharacterized mutation.

## Overall Efficacy Conclusion

As concluded by the MAH, it can be endorsed that the efficacy of dasatinib in preventing relapse of Ph+ ALL during study treatment was shown. Only 2 subjects (both Cohorts, any Risk) showed progression during  study  therapy,  one  in  bone  marrow  and  one  in  CNS,  and  one  additional  subject  developed secondary AML (possibly related to etoposide).The 3-year EFS rate was 79.6% in the Efficacy Sample (80.8%  in  the  Pediatric  Efficacy  Sample),  with  a  lower  limit  of  95%  CI  of  70.9%  (71.8%  in  the pediatric subjects). Most subjects with disease relapse prior to 3 years had electively discontinued for BMT (6/18) or after completion of therapy (3 subjects). Of 44 subjects without elective transplant, 9 relapsed after 3 years (20.5%, including 1 who discontinued study treatment at Maintenance 1), but observation is continuing.

Minimal residual disease assessments, although limited by study size, support the efficacy of dasatinib. At the end of induction, only 41.4% of subjects (combined Cohorts 1 and 2, Any Risk, Efficacy Sample) (39.2% in the Pediatric Efficacy Sample) were MRD-positive compared with 70.8% in AALL0031. This reduction in MRD-positive rate may be attributed to addition of continuous dasatinib in weeks 3-4 of induction therapy. At the end of consolidation, only 10.5% of subjects were MRD-positive (9.6% in the pediatric subjects); this reduction in MRD-positive rate, although not statistically significant compared with  the  hypothesized  16%  rate,  is  consistent  with  the  higher  potency  of  dasatinib  compared  with imatinib.

## Safety results

## Overview of Safety

A summary of safety findings (deaths, serious adverse events [SAEs], AEs leading to discontinuation, AEs,  and  AEs  of  special  interest)  is  provided  in  this  section  for  All  Treated  Subjects.  Refer  to  the CA180204 CSR for safety findings in All Pediatric Treated subjects.

Two  subjects  were  reported  with  dose-limiting  toxicities  (DLTs)  during  the  safety  phase.  In  one subject, the DLT was due to severe myelosuppression during Intensification Block 1, and was one of the events leading to the modification of the chemotherapy backbone (Amendment 2). In the second subject,  Grade  4  sensory  neuropathy  was  reported  during  Consolidation  Block  1.  A  third  subject developed prolonged Grade 3 leukoencephalopathy (per study Principal Investigator communication; also  see  narrative  for  subject  CA180204-298-791948)  during  Intensification  Block  2  after  receiving high-dose [HD] methotrexate [MTX]. This and additional subjects with neurotoxicity led to Amendment 5 whereby subjects on study at that time subsequently received a single dose of intrathecal (IT) MTX (age-based  dosing)  rather  than  triple  intrathecal  therapy  (ITT)  on  Day  29  of  Induction,  and  the scheduled dose of ITT on Day 1 of Consolidation was eliminated.

## Disposition and Exposure

A total of 34 (54.8%) subjects completed study treatment. The primary reasons for discontinuation of study  treatment  are  provided  in  Table  4.1-1.  The  most  common  reason  in  both  cohorts  for  not completing study treatment was bone marrow transplant (BMT; N = 11, 27.5% in Cohort 1; N = 7, 31.8% in Cohort 2). Of these 18 subjects, 5 were also reported as enrolled in another COG study. Only 2 subjects were reported to have disease progression during the protocol treatment.

A total of 18 (29.0%) subjects did not continue in the study.  Reasons for not continuing in the study included:  lost  to  follow-up,  enrollment  onto  another  COG  study  with  therapeutic  intent  (for  BMT  or following relapse), death, and the special reason for 1 subject considered ineligible after having started treatment.

The median duration of dasatinib therapy from first through last dasatinib dose date was 30.9 months (Table 4.1-2). The expected number of months of actual dasatinib treatment was 16.1 (70 weeks) in Cohort 1 (discontinuous dosing) and 29.4 (128 weeks) in Cohort 2 (continuous dosing). The recorded median number of months of actual dasatinib treatment was 15.0 in Cohort 1 and 26.2 in Cohort 2.

A delay &gt;14 days were reported in only 14 of 770 treatment blocks in 62 treated subjects.

Duration of therapy is the curation from the first through the last dasatinib dose date.

The adjusted average daily dose and the adjusted relative dose intensity are based on the number of dasatinib dose days.

The average daily dose and the relative dose intensity are based on the cduration of therapy.

Relative dose intensity (%) is average dasatinib daily dose relative to^ 60 mg/m2 QD dasatinib.

## Deaths

A total of 8 (12.9%) deaths were reported with 4 deaths in each cohort (refer to Table 7.2-1 of the CA180204 CSR).  None of the deaths was reported within 30 days of the last dose of treatment, and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

none was related to dasatinib treatment. Overall, 3 deaths were due to disease progression, and the remaining 5 were due to 'other cause' (cardiac failure, acute critical upper airway obstruction, MLLrearranged therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, injuries resulting from being hit by a school bus, infection due to complication of graft vs host disease).

## Serious Adverse Events

The  source  for  capturing  SAEs  reported  during  this  study  was  Adverse  Event  Expedited  Reporting System (AdEERS) forms. Events assigned as the 'primary reason' for SAEs are listed in Table 4.3-1. Some inconsistencies were noted between the AdEERS forms and COG AE database. Because AdEERS are submitted rapidly and may not have been revised based on subsequent information, the COG AE database was considered to be the definitive source for AE information including dates, severity, and relatedness. These inconsistencies were minor with no impact on overall safety results.

A total of 29 (46.8%) subjects were reported with SAEs, regardless of relationship to dasatinib (Cohort 1, N = 19/40 [47.5%]; Cohort 2, N = 10/22 [45.5%]) (refer to Table 7.3-1 of the CA180204 CSR). Drug-related  SAEs  were  reported  in  14  (35.0%)  subjects  in  Cohort  1  and  in  7 (31.8%)  subjects  in Cohort 2. Most drug-related SAEs were Grade 3/4. None led to study discontinuation.

Table 4.3-1 provides a summary of SAEs, regardless of relationship to dasatinib (All Treated Subjects).

## Discontinuations Due to Adverse Events

On-treatment toxicities or complications leading to discontinuation were reported in 2 subjects: Error! Bookmark not defined.

- CA204-78-790366 (Cohort 1, age 4 years):  The last dose of study treatment was on 19-Jul2009 (during re-induction).  At this time, the subject was reported with Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities (WBC decreased, platelet count decreased, neutrophil count decreased). These AEs were considered not likely related to dasatinib. The subject was on study for 3.84 months. Information received from the investigator after database lock indicated that this subject was discontinued  from  the  study  due  to  persistent  QTc  prolonged,  despite  withdrawal  of  other potentially-contributing agents.
- CA204-298-791948 (Cohort 1, age 12 year): The last dose of study treatment was on 8-May2010 (during intensification 2).  At this time, the subject was reported with Grade 3 sepsis and Grade 4 febrile  neutropenia.  These  AEs  were  considered  not  likely  related  to  dasatinib.  The subject  was  on  study  for  11.93  months.  Information  received  from  the  investigator  after database lock indicated that this subject was discontinued from the study due to MTX-related leukoencephalopathy.

## Overall Adverse Events

Most subjects reported on-study AEs (any grade, regardless of relationship to treatment): Cohort 1, 39/40  (97.5%);  Cohort  2,  21/22  (95.5%);  All  Treated,  60/62  (96.8%). Error!  Bookmark  not  defined. Most subjects  reported  Grade  3/4  AEs:  37/40  (92.5%)  subjects  in  Cohort  1,  21/22  (95.4%)  subjects  in Cohort 2, and 58/62 (93.5%) All Treated subjects.

The majority of subjects had at least 1 AE assessed by the investigator as related to dasatinib: Cohort 1, 32/40 (80.0%); Cohort 2, 20/22 (90.9%); All Treated, 52/62 (83.9%) (Table 4.5-1; Table 4.5-2). However, it is considered highly likely that the reported relationship was to the regimen as a whole, as these AEs are expected with intensive multi-agent chemotherapy. The most common drug-related AEs (defined as frequency ≥ 10% by cohort and overall were:

- Cohort  1:  febrile  neutropenia  (52.5%),  alanine  aminotranferase  (ALT)  increased  (45.0%), neutrophil  count  decreased  (40.0%),  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  increased  (30.0%), platelet count decreased and sepsis (both 27.5%), WBC decreased and anemia (both 20.0%), hypokalemia  (15.0%),  decreased  appetite  and  hypophosphatemia  (12.5%),  and  diarrhea, stomatitis, skin infection, hypoalbuminemia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy (all 10.0%) (Table 4.5-1).
- Cohort 2: ALT increased  (54.5%), neutrophil count decreased (50.0%), febrile neutropenia (45.5%), platelet count decreased (36.4%), nausea, vomiting, and hypokalemia (all 22.7%), anemia (18.2%), and AST increased, sepsis, and hyponatremia (all 13.6%) (Table 4.5-1).
- All Treated:  febrile neutropenia (50.0%), ALT increased (48.4%), neutrophil count decreased (43.5%), platelet count decreased (30.6%), AST increased (24.2%), sepsis (22.6%), anemia (19.4%), hypokalemia (17.7%), WBC decreased (16.1%), and decreased appetite and nausea (both 11.3%) (Table 4.5-2).

## Adverse Events of Special Interest

Safety  issues  of  special  interest  in  the  dasatinib  program  were  examined  either  because  of  their association with dasatinib in the currently approved indications, because they are recognized events in other  agents  within  this  drug  class,  or  because  safety  data  from  non-clinical  and  clinical  studies warranted careful evaluation.

Adverse  events  of  special  interest  include  fluid  retention  (including  the  subcategories  of  superficial edema,  pleural  effusion,  and  other  fluid-related  endpoints  [pericardial  effusion,  generalized  edema, CHF/cardiac dysfunction, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension]), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), hemorrhage (gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding, CNS bleeding, and other hemorrhage),  selected  cardiac  events,  arterial  ischemic  events,  diarrhea,  nausea/vomiting,  fatigue, myalgias/arthralgias, and rash. These events are described in this section.

Dasatinib-related fluid retention-related AEs were infrequent in both cohorts (Table 4.6-1; Table 4.62). Severe events (Grade 3/4) reported included one subject in Cohort 1 with generalized edema and one  subject  in  Cohort  2  with  superficial  edema.  No  cases  of  dasatinib-related  pleural  effusion, pericardial effusion, pulmonary hypertension, or PAH were reported.

Drug-related hemorrhage was reported in 3 subjects, reported as an SAE (GI bleeding) in 1 subject (CA204-117-801809), but all were considered severe: Cohort 1 had 2 subjects, one with GI bleeding and 1 with 'other hemorrhage'; Cohort 2 had 1 subject with 'other hemorrhage' (Table 4.6-1). Other AEs of interest that had an overall frequency of ≥5% in All Treated subjects were nausea/vomiting (9/62, 14.5%), diarrhea (6/62, 9.7%), and rash (4/62, 6.5%) (Table 4.6-2).  Most were severe.

## Overall Safety Conclusions

As  concluded  by  the  MAH,  it  can  be  endorsed  that  dasatinib  at  60  mg/m 2 /day  on  the  continuous schedule  was  well  tolerated  in  combination  with  intensive  multi-agent  chemotherapy.  Dasatinib discontinuous and continuous dosing schedules were equally tolerable. The planned dose of dasatinib was administered in almost all subjects.

Of the 8 deaths reported, none was reported within 30 days of the last dose of treatment, and none was  related  to  dasatinib  treatment.    Toxicities  or  complications  leading  to  discontinuation  were reported  in  2  subjects,  and  were  not  considered  related  to  dasatinib  treatment.  Overall,  83.9% subjects had at least 1 AE assessed by the investigator as related to treatment, the majority of which were  considered  severe  (Grade  3-4).  Myelosuppression  was  common  (defined  as ≥  2 0 . 0 % ) a s expected with intensive chemotherapy.

Dasatinib-related  fluid  retention-related  AEs  were  infrequent  in  both  cohorts.  Severe  events  (Grade 3/4) reported included one subject in Cohort 1 with generalized edema and one subject in Cohort 2 with superficial edema. No cases of dasatinib-related pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, pulmonary hypertension, or PAH were reported. Drug-related hemorrhage was reported in 3 subjects (2 subjects in  Cohort 1 and 1 subject in Cohort 2), reported as an SAE (GI bleeding) in 1 subject, but all were considered severe

## Discussion on clinical aspects

The conclusion and discussion as provided by the MAH is fully acceptable. It is agreed that despite early  termination  of  this  study  (in  favor  of  CA180372,  an  international  study  in  the  same  clinical setting), study CA180204 was able to achieve multiple key aims. A total of 62 subjects were treated, of whom 40 received dasatinib on the discontinuous regimen (70 weeks) and 22 received dasatinib on the continuous regimen (128 weeks).

The safety and tolerability of dasatinib were demonstrated when added to an intensive chemotherapy regimen for the treatment for Ph+ ALL in pediatric subjects. Only two subjects discontinued due to an

AE  (not  dasatinib-related)  and  the  2  DLTs  (which  prompted  safety-related  amendments)  were  not dasatinib-related. Discontinuation for elective BMT was the most common reason (18 subjects) for not completing protocol-defined treatment.

Disease  control  using  dasatinib  with  chemotherapy  was  achieved,  with  overall  3-year  EFS  rate  of 79.6% (80.8% in the pediatric sample), meeting the pre-defined target. Recurrence during treatment was very uncommon (2/62, 3.2%). Most relapses within 3 years were in subjects discontinued at Week 12 for allogeneic transplant; longer dasatinib exposure appears warranted in this setting.

Safety  and  efficacy  data  in  this  study  support  a  favorable  benefit  risk  profile  for  dasatinib  on  the continuous schedule in combination with intensive multi-agent chemotherapy in pediatric subjects with Ph+ ALL.

As stated by the MAH, the submitted study is part of a clinical development program and a variation application consisting of the full relevant paediatric data package is expected to be submitted during the first half of 2018.

It is considered that the data included in this submission do not at this time influence the benefit-risk balance for Sprycel and currently do not require further updates of the Sprycel Summary of Product Characteristics,
