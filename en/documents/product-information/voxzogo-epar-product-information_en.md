<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Posology

Voxzogo is given as a daily subcutaneous injection. The recommended dose is based on the patient's weight and is approximately between 15-30 µg/kg, where the higher dose is given to smallest children, see Table 1.

The dose can be administered using either mL graduated syringes or Unit (U) graduated syringes (see Table 1). The measurements for the Unit graduated syringes are equivalent to mL as follows: 0.1 mL = 10 Units. For practicality reasons and to account for weight-related PK changes (see section 5.2), the following dosing is recommended.

Treatment with this medicinal product should be stopped upon confirmation of no further growth potential, indicated by a growth velocity of &lt; 1.5 cm/year and closure of epiphyses.

## Missed dose

If a dose of vosoritide is missed, it can be administered within 12 hours. If more than 12 hours have passed since the original dosing schedule, the missed dose should NOT be administered. Patients/caregivers should be advised to continue with the next scheduled dose the following day.

## Growth monitoring

Patients should be monitored and assessed regularly every 3-6 months to check body weight, growth and physical development. Dose should be adjusted according to the patient's body weight (see Table 1).

## Special populations

## Patients with renal or hepatic impairment

The safety and efficacy of vosoritide in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been evaluated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Voxzogo in children aged less than 4 months of age is limited. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be made.

## Method of administration

Voxzogo is for subcutaneous single use only. This medicinal product must be administered within 3 hours of reconstitution.

Prior to injecting, a healthcare professional should:

- train caregivers on the preparation and subcutaneous injection of this medicinal product.
- train caregivers and patients to recognise signs and symptoms of decreased blood pressure.
- inform caregivers and patients what to do in the event of symptomatic decreases in blood pressure.

Patients and caregivers should be instructed to rotate sites for subcutaneous injections. Recommended injection sites on the body include the front middle of the thighs, the lower part of the abdomen except for 5 cm directly around the navel, top of the buttocks or the back of the upper arms. The same injection area should not be used on two consecutive days. Voxzogo should not be injected into sites that are red, swollen, or tender.

Patients should be well hydrated at the time of injection. It is recommended patients eat a light snack and drink an adequate amount of fluid (e.g., water, milk, juice, etc.) about 30 minutes before injecting. This is to reduce the signs and symptoms of potential decreases in blood pressure (dizziness, fatigue and/or nausea)  (see section 4.4, Blood pressure effects).

If possible, this medicinal product should be injected at approximately the same time each day.

For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded.

## Blood pressure effects

Patients with significant cardiac or vascular disease and patients on anti-hypertensive medicinal products were excluded from participation in premarketing clinical trials.

To reduce the risk of a potential decrease in blood pressure and associated symptoms (dizziness, fatigue and/or nausea), patients should be well hydrated at the time of injection (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per unit volume, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

In vitro cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition and induction studies and in vitro transporter inhibition studies have been performed. Results suggested that vosoritide is unlikely to cause CYP- or transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions in humans when the medicinal product is administered concomitantly with other medicinal products.

No other interaction studies have been performed. Because it is a recombinant human protein, vosoritide is an unlikely candidate for drug-drug interactions.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of vosoritide in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of vosoritide during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of vosoritide in milk (see section 5.3). A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Vosoritide should not be used during breast-feeding.

## Fertility

No impairment of male or female fertility has been observed in nonclinical studies (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Voxzogo has moderate influence on the ability to drive, cycle and use machines. Vosoritide may cause transient decreases in blood pressure that are usually mild but syncope, pre-syncope, and dizziness, as well as other signs and symptoms of decreased blood pressure have been reported as adverse reactions with Voxzogo. The patient's response to treatment should be considered and if appropriate, advised not to drive, cycle or use machines for at least 60 minutes after injection.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common adverse reactions to vosoritide were injection site reactions (85%), vomiting (27%), and decreased blood pressure (13%).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Hypotension

In ACH study 111301, patients aged ≥ 5 years, 13% of patients treated with vosoritide compared to 5% of patients treated with placebo, experienced events of decreases in blood pressure which were transient and resolved without intervention. The median time to onset from injection was 31 (18 to 120) minutes with resolution within 31 (5 to 90) minutes. The reported events were identified predominantly during periods of frequent vital signs monitoring at clinical visits after dosing over a 52-week treatment period. 2% of patients had a symptomatic episode with dizziness and vomiting.

In study 111-206, events of decrease in blood pressure occurred in 2 patients (5%) aged &lt; 5 years treated with vosoritide compared to 2 patients (6%) on placebo. In patients &gt; 2 years to &lt; 5 years of age, events of decrease in blood pressure were reported in 1 patient (5%) treated with vosoritide compared to 1 patient (6 %) on placebo. In patients 6 months to &lt; 2 years of age, events of decrease in blood pressure were reported in 0 patients treated with vosoritide compared to 1 patient (13%) on placebo. In patients &lt; 6 months of age, events of decrease in blood pressure were reported in 1 patient (8%) treated with vosoritide compared to 0 patients on placebo.  All events were transient, resolved without intervention and were not treatment limiting.

## Injection site reactions

In ACH study 111-301, in patients aged ≥ 5 years, injection site reactions were reported in 85% patients treated with vosoritide compared to 82% patients on placebo. Patients receiving this medicinal product who experienced injection site reactions reported a median of 76 events, compared to patients receiving placebo who reported a median of 7.5 events over a 52-week period. The most common injection site reactions (occurring in at least 10% of patients treated with vosoritide) were injection site reaction (73%), injection site erythema (68%), injection site swelling (38%), and injection site urticaria (13%). All injection site reactions were Grade 1 (mild) in severity, with the exception of 5 events in two patients that were Grade 2 (moderate). Reported Grade 2 events included; two patients who reported two events of injection site urticaria, and one event of injection site vesicles. In study 111-206, patients aged &lt; 5 years, injections site reactions were reported in 86% of patients treated with vosoritide compared to 53% patients on placebo. Patients receiving vosoritide who experienced injection site reactions reported a median of 224 events, compared to patients receiving placebo who reported a median of 114 events over a 52-week period, all of which were Grade 1 (mild) in severity. In patients &gt; 2 years to &lt; 5 years of age, injection site reactions were reported in 84% patients treated with vosoritide compared to 44% patients on placebo. In patients 6 months to &lt; 2 years of age, events of injection site reactions were reported in 83% patients treated with vosoritide

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

compared to 50% patients on placebo. In patients &lt; 6 months of age, injection site reactions were reported in 92% patients treated with vosoritide compared to 75% patients on placebo.

Across all age groups, injection site reactions were transient, and not treatment limiting.

## Immunogenicity

Of 131 patients aged 5 years of age and older with achondroplasia who were treated with vosoritide 15 µg/kg/day and evaluable for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) for up to 240 weeks, ADA were detected in 35% of patients. The earliest time to ADA development was day 85. All ADApositive patients tested negative for anti-vosoritide neutralising antibodies. There was no correlation between the number, duration, or severity of hypersensitivity adverse reactions or injection site reactions and ADA positivity or mean ADA titre. There was no association between ADA positivity or mean ADA titre and change from baseline in annual growth velocity (AGV) or height Z-score at Month 12. There was no impact of serum ADA detected on the plasma PK measurements of vosoritide.

In patients under 5 years of age, 19% (8/43) of vosoritide-treated patients tested positive for ADA and all placebo-treated patients tested negative for ADA. The earliest time to ADA development was week 26. All of the ADA-positive patients tested negative for neutralising anti-drug antibodies (NAb) at all time points. There was no impact of ADA development on safety, efficacy or PK of vosoritide.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

In clinical trials, doses of vosoritide were explored up to 30 μg/kg/day. Two patients received up to 3 times the recommended daily dose of 15 μg/kg/day for up to 5 -weeks. No signs, symptoms or adverse reactions associated with the higher than intended dose were observed.

In the event a patient takes more than they should, the patient should contact their healthcare professional.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of bone diseases, other drugs affecting bone structure and mineralisation, ATC code: M05BX07

## Mechanism of action

Vosoritide is a modified type C natriuretic peptide (CNP). In patients with achondroplasia, endochondral bone growth is negatively regulated due to a gain of function mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) . Binding of vosoritide to natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B) antagonises FGFR3 downstream signalling by inhibiting the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway at the level of rapidly accelerating fibrosarcoma serine/threonine protein kinase (RAF-1). As a result, vosoritide, like CNP, acts as a positive regulator of endochondral bone growth as it promotes chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Exposure-dependent (AUC and Cmax) increases from baseline in urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP, a biomarker for NPR-B activity) concentrations and serum collagen type X marker (CXM, a biomarker for endochondral ossification) were observed on treatment with vosoritide. Increase in the urinary cGMP concentrations from pre-dose baseline took place within the first four hours post-dose. Median serum CXM concentration increased over baseline by day 29 of daily administration of this medicinal product. This effect was maintained beyond 24 months of treatment. Vosoritide activity as measured by urine cGMP was near saturation while maximal increase in growth plate activity indicated by CXM was achieved at the dose of 15 μg/kg administered subcutaneously once daily.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The efficacy and safety of vosoritide in patients with achondroplasia with confirmed FGFR3 mutation were assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 52-week study (ACH study 111-301). In ACH study 111-301, patients were randomised to either vosoritide (n=60) or placebo (n=61) and the dose of vosoritide was 15 μg/kg administered subcutaneously once daily. Prior to randomisation, all patients enrolled in an observational study (ACH study 111-901) for paediatric patients with achondroplasia for at least a 6-month period during which baseline standing height and other pre-treatment growth assessments were collected. Patients with limb-lengthening surgery in the prior 18 months or who planned to have limb-lengthening surgery during the study period were excluded. The study comprised a 52-week placebo-controlled treatment phase followed by an open-label treatment extension study in which all patients received vosoritide. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in AGV at Week 52 compared with placebo.

Patients with achondroplasia were also treated with vosoritide 15 μg/kg/day in an open label, dose -escalation study and in its long-term extension study (ACH study 111-205). Data was collected from observational studies in patients to characterise the natural history of achondroplasia. Height data from untreated patients with achondroplasia in the same age range as the clinical studies was used as an historical control to assess the effect on height after up to 5 years of vosoritide treatment.

Patient demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 3.

AGV, annualised growth velocity; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval; LS, least-square; SD, standard deviation.

- a Difference is 15 µg/kg Voxzogo minus placebo.

b Two-sided p-value.

- c Two patients in the Voxzogo group discontinued from the study before Week 52. The values for these 2 patients were imputed for this analysis.
- LS mean estimated from the ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) model adjusted for baseline differences between the two arms, analysis of covariance.

The benefit of improvement in AGV in favour of Voxzogo was consistent across all predefined subgroups analysed including sex, age group, Tanner stage, baseline height Z-score, and baseline AGV. In the subgroup of males Tanner stage &gt; I, the point estimate of treatment effect was in favour of vosoritide however there were only 8 subjects in this subgroup (3 and 5 subjects in vosoritide and placebo arms, respectively).

The observed increase in growth occurred proportionally in both the spine and the lower limbs. There was no difference in bone mineral density after treatment with Voxzogo compared to placebo. During treatment with this medicinal product, the mean increase in bone age was comparable to the mean increase in chronological age, indicating no acceleration of bone maturation.

Figure 1 shows the effect of Voxzogo over the two-year period in the Voxzogo treatment group, as well as the effect in the placebo control group after receiving daily subcutaneous injections of Voxzogo for 52 weeks in the open label extension study. Improvements in AGV were maintained during continued Voxzogo therapy, with no evidence of tachyphylaxis.

Figure 1: Mean (±SD) 12-Month Interval AGV Over Time

<!-- image -->

The figure includes all subjects enrolled in the pivotal trial who had a height assessment at week 52 in the extension study. Solid lines represent treatment with vosoritide 15 ug/kg; dashed lines represent placebo. Baseline is defined as the last assessment before the first dose of active study drug (i.e. vosoritide) or Placebo in 111-301.

12-Month AGV at post-baseline visits is derived over the previous 12 months. For example, 12-Month Interval AGV at Week 52 111-302 = [(Height at Week 52 111-302 Visit- Height at Week 52 111-301 Visit)/(Date of Week 52 111-302 Visit - Date of Week 52 111-301 Visit)] x 365.25.

## Open-label extension study

In the long-term extension study (ACH study 111-205), 10 patients were treated with Voxzogo 15 µg/kg/day dose continuously for up to 5 years. The mean (SD) improvement in AGV compared to baseline at 60 months was 1.34 (1.31) cm/year.

The gain in height after 5 years of treatment with 15 µg/kg/day of Voxzogo was compared with an age and sex matched historical control. The 5-year cross-sectional comparative analysis adjusted for baseline height differences, demonstrated, there was a statistically significant mean (95% CI) difference in height in favour of Voxzogo (9.08 [5.77, 12.38] cm; p=0.0002) compared with untreated patients with achondroplasia.

## Paediatric population &lt;5 years

A total of 75 patients aged 4.4 months to 59.8 months at day 1 of dosing were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 52-week study. At least 6 months of baseline growth data were collected in the observational study for patients who were aged 6 months and over at randomization, and at least 3-months baseline data for those subjects aged under 6 months at randomization. A total of 64 patients were randomised to receive vosoritide treatment or placebo and 11 patients received open-label treatment. At 52 weeks, patients treated with vosoritide had an improvement in Height Z-score +0.30 SDS (95% CI 0.07, 0.54) compared to placebo.

Nine children aged &gt;24 to &lt;60 months were treated with vosoritide for 3 years and showed an improvement in Height Z-score of + 1.22 SDS (95% CI 0.78, 1.66) and a LS mean difference in height of 5.73 cm (95%CI 3.54, 7.93) compared with an age and sex matched historical control of untreated patients with achondroplasia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Eleven children aged &gt;6 to &lt;24 months were treated with vosoritide for 2 years and showed an improvement in Height Z-score of + 0.79 SDS (95% CI 0.29, 1.28) and a LS mean difference in height of 2.69 cm (95%CI 1.00, 4.38) compared with an age and sex matched historical control of untreated patients with achondroplasia.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Vosoritide is a modified recombinant human CNP. The 39 amino acid peptide analogue includes the 37 C terminal amino acids of the human CNP53 sequence plus the addition of 2 amino acids (Pro Gly) to convey resistant to neutral endopeptidase (NEP) degradation, resulting in prolonged half-life in comparison to endogenous CNP.

The pharmacokinetics of vosoritide were evaluated in a total of 58 patients aged 5 to 18 years with achondroplasia who received subcutaneous injections of vosoritide 15 µg/kg once daily for 52 weeks. The pharmacokinetic exposure of vosoritide in 15 patients aged 2 to &lt; 5 years old were comparable with older children.

In 8 patients aged 6 months to &lt; 2 years old, receiving 30 µg/kg once daily the pharmacokinetic exposure of vosoritide was 65% to 70% higher than the older children (&gt; 2 years old) receiving 15 µg/kg once daily. In 9 patients &lt; 6 months of age receiving 30 µg/kg once daily, the pharmacokinetic exposure of vosoritide was 57% to 105% higher than the older children (&gt; 2 years old) receiving 15 µg/kg once daily.

## Absorption

Vosoritide was absorbed with a median Tmax of 15 minutes. The mean (± SD) peak concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration (AUC0-t) observed after 52 weeks of treatment was 5 800 (±3 680), and 290 000 (± 235 000) pg-min/mL respectively. The bioavailability of vosoritide was not assessed in clinical studies.

## Distribution

The mean (± SD) apparent volume of distribution after 52 weeks of treatment was 2 910 (± 1 660) mL/kg.

## Biotransformation

The metabolism of vosoritide is expected to occur via catabolic pathways and be degraded into small peptide fragments and amino acids.

## Elimination

The mean (± SD) apparent clearance after 52 weeks of treatment was 79.4 (53.0) mL/min/kg. The mean (± SD) half-life was 27.9 (9.9) minutes.

The inter-subject variability (coefficient of variation) in apparent clearance was 33.6 %.

## Linearity/non-linearity

The increase in plasma exposure (AUC and Cmax) with dose was greater than dose proportional across the dose range of 2.5 (0.17 times the recommended dose) to 30.0 μg/kg/day (twice the approved dose).

## Special populations

No clinically significant differences in the vosoritide pharmacokinetics was observed based on age (0.9 to 16 years), sex, race or ethnicity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Body weight

Body weight is the only significant covariate for vosoritide clearance or volume of distribution. The apparent clearance and volume of distribution of vosoritide increased with increasing body weight in patients with achondroplasia (9 to 74.5 kg). The proposed posology (see section 4.2) takes account of this deviation and recommends the use of doses above (in patients between 10 and 16 kg body weight), or below (in those above a body weight of 44 kg) the 15 µg/kg 'standard dose' in order to enable a similar level of exposure across all weight-ranges.

## Patients with renal and hepatic impairment

The safety and efficacy of vosoritide in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been evaluated. Based on the elimination mechanism, renal or hepatic impairment is not expected to alter the pharmacokinetics of vosoritide.

## Drug interaction studies

In vitro cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition and induction studies indicated that vosoritide did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4/5, nor induce CYP 1A2, 2B6, or 3A4/5 at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro interaction studies also indicated that the potential for interaction with the drug-transporters OAT1, OAT3, OCT 1, OCT 2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE 1, KATE2-K, BCRP, P-gp, and BSEP is low at clinically relevant concentrations.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels, and with possible relevance to clinical use.

Transient decreases in blood pressure and increases in heart rate were observed in healthy monkeys across multiple studies in doses of 28 to 300 μg/kg in a dose -related manner. Peak effects were typically observed within the first hour post dose and were generally asymptomatic. In some monkeys receiving higher doses of vosoritide, brief bouts of sternal/lateral recumbency or hypoactivity, were observed. These effects could be related to decreased blood pressure.

Adverse effects on body posture, bone shape, mobility, and bone strength were observed in normal animals in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys. In monkeys, the NOAEL for vosoritide is 25 μg/kg (mean C max value of 1 170 pg/mL; approximately equivalent to the recommended human dose in a 20 kg human) when administered daily via subcutaneous injection for 44 weeks.

## Carcinogenicity / mutagenicity

Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity studies have not been performed with vosoritide. Based on the mechanism of action, vosoritide is not expected to be tumorigenic.

## Impairment of fertility

In a fertility and reproductive study in male and female rats at dose levels up to 540 μg/kg/day, vosoritide had no effect on mating performance, fertility, or litter characteristics.

## Reproductive and developmental toxicity

Vosoritide was not associated with effects on reproductive performance, in utero or developmental parameters measured in rats and rabbits to investigate fertility, or embryo-foetal development in preand post-natal development studies.

Vosoritide was detected in the breast milk in rats.

## 1. What Voxzogo is and what it is used for

## What Voxzogo is

Voxzogo contains the active substance vosoritide. It is similar to a protein in the body called C type natriuretic peptide (CNP). Vosoritide is made by recombinant technology involving bacteria that have been modified to include the gene for producing the protein.

## What Voxzogo is used for

This medicine is used for the treatment of achondroplasia in patients 4 months of age and older whose bones are still growing. Achondroplasia is a genetic condition that affects growth of almost all bones in the body including the skull, spine, arms and legs resulting in very short stature with a characteristic appearance .

The product is indicated only in achondroplasia which is caused by mutations in the FGFR3-gene as confirmed by genetic testing.

## How does Voxzogo work

The active substance in Voxzogo works directly on the growth points of your bones to promote new bone growth.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Voxzogo

## Do not use Voxzogo

- -if you or your child are allergic to vosoritide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor before using Voxzogo:

- -If you or your child have significant heart disease or blood pressure problems.
- -If you or your child are taking or have recently taken medicines that lower blood pressure.

If any of these applies to you or your child or you are unsure, talk to the doctor before using Voxzogo.

## Blood pressure effects

Voxzogo can lower blood pressure. As a result, you may feel dizzy, nauseous, or tired. Blood pressure usually returns to normal within 90 minutes of Voxzogo injection. If these effects occur and are severe, tell your doctor.

Drinking plenty of fluids at the time of injection may reduce the likelihood of these effects. It is recommended patients eat a light snack and drink enough fluid (e.g. water, milk or juice) about 30 minutes before injection.

## Children and adolescents

There is not enough information on the use of this medicine in children under 4 months old and therefore it is not recommended.

## Other medicines and Voxzogo

Tell your doctor if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you or your child are being treated with this medicine and are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine.

The use of this medicine is not recommended during pregnancy and breast-feeding.

## Driving, cycling and using machines

This medicine may cause you to feel dizzy, light-headed, tired or you may feel sick shortly after your injection. If this happens, you should not drive, ride a bicycle, do physical activities or use machines for around an hour after injection or until you feel better.

## Voxzogo contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodiumfree'.

## 3. How to use Voxzogo

A caregiver should give the Voxzogo injection. Do not inject your child with Voxzogo until you have had proper training from a healthcare professional.

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

## Dose

Your doctor will choose the correct dose depending on your or your child's bodyweight. The doctor will tell you how much of the injection solution to inject. If you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Table 1 shows the dose you or your child will need to inject daily based on bodyweight. The amount to inject may be presented as different volumes based on the type of syringe included in your pack (millilitres (mL) or Units (U)). Please check that you have the correct dose for the syringe you are using.
