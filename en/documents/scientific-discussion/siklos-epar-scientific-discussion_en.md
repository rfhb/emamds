## Introduction

Sickle  Cell  Syndrome  (SCS)  is  one  of  the  most  commonly  inherited  diseases  world  wide,  with  an estimated  prevalence  in  the  European  Union  of  0.56  in  10,000  persons.  Furthermore,  the  sickle β -globin gene is widely spread throughout Africa, the Middle East, Mediterranean countries and India and the frequency of sickle cell carriers  is  up  to  one  in  four  in  West  Africans  and  1  in  10  in  Afro Caribbean's. It has reached such high levels in these latter populations because the silent carrier state protects against malaria.

SCS describes a group of inherited genetic conditions characterised by an abnormality (called variant S) of haemoglobin A (HbA). This family of haemoglobin disorders results from inheriting the sickle β -globin  gene  (S),  which  gives  rise  to  abnormal  haemoglobin,  HbS.  The  sickle β -globin  chain  is  the consequence of a single amino acid substitution in the chain ( β -6 glutamic acid to valine), and sicklecell syndrome is caused by combinations of two variant alleles of the β -globin gene, at least one of which  carries  the β -6  glu-val  mutation.  The  most  common  and  severe  form  of  SCS  is  sickle  cell anaemia, the homozygote (SS) situation where the sickle β -globin gene has been inherited from both parents. Other compound heterozygote conditions can also occur, featuring the same clinical problems as SCA, and these include combinations of a sickle β -globin allele with other structural variants of the β -chain  (e.g.  SC  disease  or  with  a β -thalassemia  mutation  giving  rise  either  to  S β 0  or  S β +).  The presence  of  HbS  causes  SCS  as  this  haemoglobin  forms  insoluble  and  viscous  polymers  under deoxygenated  conditions,  distorting  the  red  blood  cells  (RBC)  into  the  classis  sickle  shape.  The intrinsic oxygen binding ability of HbS, however, is unaltered. The polymerisation of deoxygenated HbS is the primary event in the molecular pathogenesis of SCS, resulting in a distortion of the shape and  increased  rigidity  of  the  RBC.  The  polymerisation  of  HbS  upon  deoxygenation  also  results  in cellular dehydration and decreased deformability and stickiness of red blood cells that promotes their adhesion to vascular endothelium. These rigid cells are responsible for the chronic haemolytic anaemia and the vaso-occlusive phenomena that characterise the disease, and which can give rise to chronic organ damage.

The most common clinical problem is a painful vaso-occlusive crisis, which causes over 90% of acute hospital admissions, and significant morbidity in the community. While the problems are generally the result of small vessel vaso-occlusion, large vessel disease also occurs resulting in thrombotic cerebral vascular accidents, the acute chest syndromes (ACS) and/or placental infarction. ACS is an important complication  as  it  is  the  second  most  common  cause  of  hospitalisation  in  sickle  cell  patients  and accounts for more than 25% of premature deaths in sickle cell disease. Death may also be caused by chronic  organ  failure  or  as  a  result  of  other  acute  catastrophic  event  such  as  a  stroke,  splenic sequestration  or  other  complications.  Recent in  vivo studies  in  transgenic  mice  further  suggest  that vascular  occlusion  results  in  the  creation  of  an  inflammatory  state  that  contributes  to  pathological sequelae. People with sickle cell disease are susceptible to a broad array of health problems, including anaemia, pain and serious infections. One of the major goals for therapy of SCS is to decrease the effective  intracellular  concentration  of  HbS  and  so  reduce  polymerisation  in  conditions  of  lowered oxygen tension with the intent of ultimately ameliorating vaso-occlusion, sickle cell painful crises and acute and chronic organ damage. The management of SCS is primarily palliative in nature, including supportive, symptomatic and preventative approaches to therapy. The methods of primary molecular and cellular therapy in patients with SCS include the induction of foetal haemoglobin (HbF), cellular rehydration,  anti-adhesion  therapy,  NO  and  it's  precursors,  transplantation  (curative  treatment  may involve allogeneic bone marrow transplantation) and gene therapy (although this is currently limited to investigational  laboratory  procedures).  In  terms  of  preventive  treatment  however,  the  use  of  agents that increase the production of HbF has been by far the most promising approach. The expression of globin genes is regulated during ontogeny, and in humans globin production is characterized by two major  'switches';  production  of  embryonic  haemoglobin  switches  after  the  first  two  months  of gestation into the production of HbF and then again before birth into adult haemoglobin (HbA and HbA2). An increase in HbF in SCS ameliorates the clinical symptoms of the underlying disease as HbF-containing  RBC  (F  cells)  have  both  lower  concentrations  of  HbS,  and  HbF  directly  inhibits

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

polymerization of HbS, accounting for the lower propensity of such cells to form intracellular polymer and cause pathophysiologic consequences.

The beneficial effects of high levels of HbF in SCS have been recognized for many years following clinical and epidemiological observations, as well as laboratory studies. As early as 1948, it was noted that  newborns with SCS do not manifest significant clinical problems related to their disease in the first 6 months of life until the HbF declines to adult levels. The level of HbF in normal adults is 1% or less with the HbF primarily sequestered in 1 to 5% of total circulating red cells. The number of these F cells and the overall level of HbF in circulating F cells are to a large degree determined by heritable traits, although levels of HbF can also be affected by environmental factors (e.g., erythropoietic stress, exposure to certain cytotoxin compounds). It has been shown that most patients with SCS from certain regions  of  Saudi  Arabia  and  India  who  inherit  a  genetic  determinant  for  high  HbF  (more  than  50 mutations have been described that increase HbF synthesis in postnatal life) have a very mild sickling disorder, while a more recent large multicentre study of the natural history of SCS demonstrated an inverse correlation between HbF levels and the frequency of painful crisis and early death. Based on this evidence, therapeutic agents that increase HbF production have been developed for patients with this disorder.

## About the product

Hydroxyurea  (HU)  or  hydroxycarbamide  (international  non-proprietary  name)  is  an  antineoplastic drug that has been marketed over the world for several decades including in the US, Canada and the EU.  HU  is  used  in  the  treatment  of  melanoma,  resistant  chronic  myeloid  leukemia,  recurrent metastatic or inoperable carcinoma of the ovary, epidermoid carcinomas of the head and neck, cervical cancer,  haematological  disorders  and  HIV.  Its  mechanism  of  action  is  believed  to  be  based  on  its inhibition of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase.

On July 9, 2003, the European Commission granted Orphan Medicinal Product Designation to Siklos (OTL Pharma) containing the active substance hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea, HU) for the treatment of Sickle Cell Syndrome (SCS).

- -Indication

Siklos is indicated for the prevention of recurrent painful vaso-occlusive crises including acute chest syndrome  in  paediatric  and  adult  patients  suffering  from  symptomatic  Sickle  Cell  Syndrome.  (see section SPC 5.1)

Treatment with Siklos should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of Sickle Cell Syndrome.

- -Posology

In adults, adolescents and children older than 2 years:

The posology should be based on the patient's body weight. The starting dose of hydroxycarbamide is 15  mg/kg  b.w.  and  the  usual  dose  is  between  15  and  30  mg/kg  b.w./day.  Under  exceptional circumstances a maximum dose of 35 mg/kg b.w./day might be justified under close haematological monitoring (see section 4.4). The dosage of Siklos can be adjusted to body weight by increments of 250 mg by using a quarter of tablet. As long as the patient responds to therapy either clinically or haematologically  (e.g.  increase  of  haemoglobin  F  (HbF),  Mean  Corpuscular  Volume  (MCV), neutrophil count) the dose of Siklos should be maintained. In case of non-response (re-occurrence of crises or no decrease in crisis rate) the daily dose may be increased by 250 mg steps. In the event a patient does still not respond when treated with the maximum dose of hydroxycarbamide (35 mg/kg b.w./day) over three to six months, permanent discontinuation of Siklos should be considered.

If blood counts are within the toxic range Siklos should be temporarily discontinued until blood counts recover. Haematologic recovery usually occurs within two weeks. Treatment may then be reinstituted at  a  reduced  dose.  The  dose  of  Siklos  may  then  be  increased  again  under  close  haematological monitoring. A dose producing haematological toxicity should not be tried more than two times.

The toxic range may be characterised by the following results of blood tests: Neutrophils &lt; 2000 /mm 3 , Platelets  &lt;  80,000/mm 3 ,  Haemoglobin  &lt;  4.5  g/dl,  Reticulocytes  &lt;  80,000/mm 3 if  the  haemoglobin concentration  &lt;  9  g/dl.  Long-term  data  on  the  continued  use  of  hydroxycarbamide  in  patients  with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sickle  Cell  Syndrome  are  available  in  children  and  adolescents,  with  a  follow-up  of  12  years  in adolescents and over 13 years in adults. It is currently unknown how long patients should be treated with  Siklos.  The  duration  of  treatment  is  the  responsibility  of  the  treating  physician  and  should  be based on the clinical and haematological status of the individual patient.

## Children less than 2 years of age

Because of the rarity of data on treatment with hydroxycarbamide in children less than 2 years of age, dosage  regimens  have  not  been  established  and  thus,  in  this  population,  the  treatment  with hydroxycarbamide is not recommended.

## Children and adolescents (2-18 years old)

In  children  and  adolescents  with  Sickle  Cell  Syndrome,  systemic  exposure  to  hydroxycarbamide  is similar to adult patients. Hence, no dose-adjustments are necessary in younger patients.

## Renal impairment:

As renal excretion is a main pathway of elimination, dosage reduction of Siklos should be considered in patients with renal impairment. In patients with a creatinine clearance ≤ 60 ml/min the initial Siklos dose should be decreased by 50%. Close monitoring of haematologic parameters is advised in these patients.  Siklos  should  not  be  administered  to  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment:

There are no data that support specific dosage adjustments in patients with hepatic impairment. Close monitoring  of  haematological  parameters  is  advised  in  these  patients.  Due  to  safety  considerations, Siklos is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

## Method of administration

Conforming with the individual  dosage,  the  tablet  or  the  halves  or  quarters  of  the  tablet  should  be taken  once  daily,  preferably  in  the  morning  before  breakfast  and,  where  necessary,  with  a  glass  of water or a very small amount of food.

## Quality aspects

## Introduction

Siklos  is  presented  as  film-coated  tablets  containing  1000  mg  of  hydroxycarbamide  as  active substance. The tablets have a triple scoring line on both sides, which allows dividing them into four equal parts of 250 mg each.

The other  ingredients  include  sodium  stearyl  fumarate,  micro-crystalline  cellulose  and  colloidal anhydrous silica and basic butylated methacrylate copolymer.

The tablets are packed in PVC/PVDC/Aluminium blisters.

## Active Substance

Hydroxycarbamide is white to almost white, crystalline powder. It is hygroscopic, freely soluble in water and practically insoluble in alcohol. No evidence of polymorphism has been demonstrated. In any case hydroxycarbamide being freely soluble in water, the physical characteristics of the active are not considered critical.

A certificate of Suitability to the Monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia (R0-CEP 2003-015-Rev 02), listing additional tests and limits for any other impurities and residual solvents, is available for the manufacturer of the active substance.

Batch  analysis  data  provided  for  3  production-scale  batches  confirm  compliance  with  the  PhEur monograph.

No stability data have been provided and the certificate of suitability does not include a retest period or shelf-life for hydroxycarbamide. As a consequence, the active substance will be tested immediately prior to manufacture of the finished product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Medicinal Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The  objective  was  to  develop  an  oral  formulation,  which  allows  administration  to  both  adults  and children while taking into account the dosage range.

The  poor  compression  properties  of  hydroxycarbamide  (very  poor  cohesion  properties,  very  bad capacity to transmit forces into the powder bed and hygroscopicity resulting in intense sticking during compression)  have  been  compensated  by  a  suitable  choice  of  excipients.  Silicified  microcrystalline cellulose allows direct compression and sodium stearyl fumarate is used as a lubricant to decrease the level of friction, to improve the transmission of force into the powder bed and to decrease friability. The ratio of active substance/excipients in the formulation has been optimised based on development studies in order to improve the manufacturing process.

In order to protect skin and mouth membranes from direct contact with antineoplastic hydroxycarbamide  (see  clinical  and  non-clinical  section),  the  tablets  are  film-coated  with  basic butylated methacrylate copolymer. A coating soluble in organic solvents has been selected due to the sensitivity  of  the  active  to  moisture.  Concerning  the  risk  of  contact  when  breaking  the  tablets, recommendations on how to handle the tablets have been added in the product information and, the applicant was requested to develop an additional pharmaceutical form after opinion (see Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects).

Uniformity of mass of both halves and quarters of tablets in line with PhEur has been demonstrated.

All the excipients are of PhEur quality. Regarding the TSE risk, Siklos does not contain any ingredient of ruminant origin.

Satisfactory specifications have been set up for PVC/PE/PVDC/Aluminium blister.

The finished product batch used in clinical trial had the same qualitative and quantitative composition as the commercial formulation.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The manufacturing process consists of the standard following operations: blending, direct compression and coating.

Satisfactory in-process controls have been defined. Hydroxycarbamide being an antineoplastic agent, the equipment is dedicated to this type of agent.

Because of some variations in resistance to crushing observed for the tablet cores during development and  the  possible  impact  on  breakability,  the  initial  compression  force  has  been  modified  during development.  Moreover  in  order  to  improve  the  breakability  of  the  tablets,  the  punch  used  to manufacture the product has been modified in order to increase the depth of the scoring lines and the shape of the tablets extended.

Validation  data  on  3  pilot  scale  batches  and  on  1  production  scale  batch  have  been  provided  and confirm that the process is sufficiently robust in order to ensure batch to batch consistency.

## · Product Specification

The  finished  product  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  identity  (IR  and  HPLC),  assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), urea (TLC), residual solvents (GC), uniformity of dosage units (PhEur),  subdivision  of  tablets  (halves  and  quarters),  resistance  to  crushing  (PhEur),  disintegration (PhEur), dissolution (PhEur), and microbial limits (PhEur).

Batch  analysis data provided  for the validation  batches  confirm  satisfactory  compliance  and uniformity with the proposed specification

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Stability of the Product

## -Stability of tablets

Stability data have been presented for 2 pilot scale batches and on 2 production scale batches.

Under long-term conditions (25°C/40% RH - commercial packaging) and under accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH - commercial packaging) respectively up to 26-months and 6-month data are available. Stability  data  have  also  been  provided  under  intermediate  conditions  (30°C/65%  RH  -  commercial packaging).

The parameters tested included appearance, assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), resistance to crushing (PhEur), disintegration (PhEur), dissolution (PhEur), and microbial limits (PhEur).

The observed changes were small, and not likely to have a significant effect on efficacy and safety of the product when used according to the directions in the SPC.

The data provided support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.

## -Stability of broken tablets

Satisfactory stability data for the broken tablets have been provided and support the proposed storage conditions defined in the SPC.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The  active  substance  is  well  characterised  and  documented.  The  pharmaceutical  form  selected  is adequate taking into account the properties and the stability of the drug substance. The excipients are commonly  used  for  this  kind  of  formulation  and  the  packaging  material  is  well  documented.  The manufacturing process enhances to obtain reproducible finished product batches. Stability tests under ICH conditions indicate that the product is stable for the proposed shelf life.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of unresolved quality issues having no impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product. Among those, the subdivision of film-coated tablets for an antineoplastic  agent  was  considered  not  optimal,  and  the  applicant  was  requested  to  develop  an additional  pharmaceutical  form  more  suitable  for  children  as  well  as  a  child-resistant  packaging. Moreover, recommendations on how to handle the tablets and how to store the unused broken tablets are mentioned in the SPC (section 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling) and in the package  leaflet  (section  3.  How  to  take  Siklos  and  section  5.  How  to  store  Siklos)  of  the  package leaflet. The applicant committed to resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe.

## Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

HU is a cytostatic agent that has no specific demethylating activity and which promotes methylation in a  non-specific  way.  The  precise  mechanism  by  which  HU  produces  its  cytotoxic  and  cytoreductive effects  is  not  known.  Various  studies  (Yarbro,  1992;  Choy,  1998;  McClarty,  1987)  support  the hypothesis that HU causes an immediate inhibition of DNA synthesis by acting as a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor without interfering with the synthesis of ribonucleic acid or of protein. Ribonucleotide reductase is the enzyme that catalyzes synthesis of deoxyribonucleoside diphophosphates  (dNDPs)  from  ribonucleoside  diphosphates  (rNDPs).  Ribonucleotide  reductase reduces the hydroxyl at carbon 2 of the ribose sugar in the rNDP to hydrogen, forming a deoxyribose sugar and a corresponding dNDP. A free-radical mechanism is involved in the reaction.

## Pharmacology

- Primary pharmacodynamics

## Increase of foetal haemoglobin levels in Red Blood Cells

HU  increases HbF  levels,  thereby  altering  the  kinetics and  thermodynamics  of  haemoglobin  S polymerisation  (Atweh,  2003). In vitro ,  HU  raised γ -globin  levels  by  acting  on  early adult  human

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

erythroid progenitors (Stoeckert, 1994) as well as by interacting directly with late erythroid precursors that are already engaged in haemoglobin production (Fibach, 1993). HU increased total intracellular haemoglobin (Erard, 1981) in the human K562 erythroleukemia cell line and preferentially increased G γ -globin  mRNA  levels  in  these  cells  (Xu,  1998).  Furthermore,  in  two-phase mixed  cultures  of peripheral-blood  mononuclear  and  erythroid progenitor  cells  from  normal  donors,  HU  significantly increased both γ -globin mRNA levels and HbF, and also had a comparatively small stimulatory effect on ß-globin mRNA expression (Smith, 2000). HU altered globin gene expression independently of its cytotoxic  effects  in  erythroid  progenitors  derived  from  umbilical  cord  samples  or  peripheral  blood from  patients  with  HbS-hereditary  persistence  of  HbF  or  homozygote  sickle  cell  anaemia  HU treatment led to the recruitment of a pool of non-proliferating HbF-programmed erythroid progenitors (Baliga, 2000).

HU administration augmented HbF production and inhibit in vitro growth of erythroid colonies from the blood of juvenile cynomolgus monkeys (Letvin, 1985). In vivo, HU (100 mg/kg b.w./d for 5 d) produced a 'dramatic' increase  in  F  cells  and  foetal  haemoglobin  in  anaemic  juvenile  cynomolgus monkeys (Letvin, 1984).The effect of treatment with a combination of erythropoietin, stem cell factor and HU on HbF levels has also been evaluated in a baboon model (Lavelle, 2001).

## Increased synthesis of Nitric Oxide

HU can be oxidized by haeme groups to produce the free-radical gas molecule NO (nitric oxide) in vitro (Stolze,  1990;  Pacelli,  1996).    Nitric  oxide  detected  as  nitrosyl  haemoglobin  or  nitrosyl haemoprotein  complexes    is  the  result  of  the  metabolism  of  HU  (Jiang,  1997),  generated  in  the presence and absence of catalase (Sakano, 2001). Chemical oxidation of HU produces nitric oxide and nitroxyl, the one-electron reduced form of NO. These oxidative pathways generally proceed through the  nitroxide  radical  or  C-nitrosoformamide.  Biological  oxidants,  including  both  iron  and  coppercontaining enzymes and proteins, also convert HU to NO or its decomposition products in vitro and these reactions also occur through these intermediates. A number of other reactions of HU, including the reaction with ribonucleotide reductase and irradiation, also demonstrate the potential to release NO (King,  2003).  It  is  important  to  note  that  HbF  induction by  HU  is  mediated  by  the  NO-dependent activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase. - Individual variations in NO signal amplification secondary to NO  scavenging  or  sGC/phosphodiesterase activitiesexplain the variable responsiveness to  HU treatment (Cokic, 2003).

## Reduction in red cell - endothelial adhesion

In  vitro ,  HU  significantly  and  dose-dependently  changes  the  morphology  and  monovalent  cations composition of cultured vascular endothelial  cells  (Adragna,  1994).  HU  reduces  adhesion  molecule expression  on  sickle  erythrocytes,  including  VLA-4  and  CD36  which  are  found  in  unusually  high numbers  on  sickle  cell  reticulocytes  and  mediate  adhesion  of  sickle  RBC  to  endothelium  (Styles, 1997). HU  reversibly, dose-dependently and significantly decreases the release of the vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) through downregulation of ET-1 gene expression (SCS patients exhibit elevated  serum  levels  of  ET-1  during  episodes  of  vaso-occlusive  crisis  and  levels  correlate  with disease severity). In addition, HU reduces the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM1)  on  endothelial  cells.  The  mechanism  by  which  HU  reduces  reticulocyte-endothelium  adhesion  is further explained (Brun, 2003).

## Effects on sickle red cell rheology

Erythrocyte  hydration  status  and  deformability  can  be  increased  by  HU  (Adragna,  1994;  Brugnara, 2001; Ballas, 2002; Davies, 2003). Cell dehydration induced by hypoxia is blunted by HU,  suggesting a  major role for the Gardos channel in hypoxia-induced dehydration in  vivo (De Franceschi, 1999). HU  can  raise  mean  corpuscular  volume  and  lower  mean  corpuscular  Hb  concentration  without influencing HbF synthesis (Orringer, 1991).

## Other effects

The inhibition of ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase by HU  has also been studied in myeloproliferative disorders such as chronic myelogenous leukaemia and polycythaemia rubra vera. HU has also been investigated in the treatment of various solid tumours such as malignant melanoma, refractory  ovarian  cancer,  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  head  and  neck,  renal  cell  carcinoma, transition cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder and advanced prostate cancer.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Secondary pharmacodynamics

No secondary pharmacodynamics studies have been conducted.

- Safety pharmacology programme

No pharmacology studies addressing the effects on heart rate, body temperature, respiratory function or locomotive activity that are relevant to the present submission have been conducted.

- Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

One pharmacodynamic drug interaction study has been published, which investigated the combination of  a  single  dose  of  vinblastine  (an  M  phase  cytotoxic  agent)  and  a  5-day  production  course  of  HU (Letvin,1985).

## Pharmacokinetics

- Method

An analytical HPLC method for determination of the assay and impurities has been conducted for the present submission. Recently published methods  are also based on high performance  liquid chromatography  with  electrochemical,  ultraviolet  or  colorimetric  detection  (Pujari,  1997;  Iyamu, 1998; Mannouilov, 1998) and are reported to be suitable for pharmacokinetic investigations (Pujari, 1997).

- Absorption

In vivo mouse studies have been published, showing that HU is 50% bioavailable after i.p. and p.o. administration of 300 mg/kg b.w. (Tracewell, 1994). The dose-concentration of i.p. HU in BALB/c nu/nu nude  mice  is  linear  at  doses  of  between  50    and  200  mg/kg  b.w.  (Van  den  Berg,    1994). Complete absorption of  the  drug  has  been  assayed  from  by  the  excretion  pattern  of  orally  and  i.p. administered 14 C-HU in mice, with only 0.1% of the drug being excreted via faeces (Adamson, 1965).

- Distribution

HU enters cells via passive diffusion, and rapidly equilibrates in tissue and in blood. (Gwilt, 1998). The fate of HU has been evaluated in mice and rats following parenteral and oral doses (Adamson, 1965; Philips, 1967). HU is found at very low concentrations in the liver, at medium concentrations in lung and brain tissue, and highest concentrations in the kidney, during i.p.administration. HU rapidly diffuses  into  brain  tissue,    behaving    in  a  dose-dependent  manner  up  to  200  mg/kg  b.w.  A  linear relationship between dose and concentration is observed at doses of 50 - 200 mg/kg b.w (Van den Berg, 1994). Distribution of HU into solid mammary model tumour tissue is rapid at a dose of 0.25 mg/g b.w. with HU concentrations being similar in blood and tumour tissue (Fabricius, 1971). HU distributes  into  human  CSF  and  is  transported  from  the  CSF  to  sub-ependymal  brain  sites.  HU  is removed from the brain by probenecid- and digoxin-sensitive transport mechanisms at the blood-brain barrier. However, HU distribution to the CSF, choroid plexus and pituitary gland remains unaffected by other drugs. An organic anion transporter and  p-glycoprotein are potentially implicated in the brain distribution of HU (Dogruel, 2003). HU is rapidly and widely distributed  into breast milk, across the placenta and through the blood-brain barrier. This is consistent with the large volume of distribution in humans. Data on the extent of protein binding of HU have not been provided.

- Metabolism

After  i.p.  administration  of 14 C-HU  to  mice,  equal  amounts  of 14 C-HU  and 14 C-urea  totalling  in aggregate over 80% of the dose can be found in urine 24 h after administration. 14 C-carbonate in urine and  carbon  dioxide  in  the  expired  air  account  for  a  further  11%  of  the 14 C. In  vitro experiments indicate highest degradative activities for the formation of urea in kidney and liver (Adamson, 1965). HU  is  enzymatically  reduced  by  liver  tissue  with  the  greatest  amount  of  activity  in  hepatic mitochondria (Colvin, 1970). Furthermore, HU is a substrate for the enzyme urease in vitro . The rate of degradation of urea by urease is about 1,000 times that of HU, however, the degradation products of HU have not been identified and the contribution of urease to the metabolism of HU in vivo remains unclear  (Davidson,  1963).  HU  forms  methaemoglobin  from  oxyhaemoglobin  with  concomitant formation of the aminocarboxylaminooxyl radical H2N-CO-HNO ° and the production of NO (Stolze,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1990; Pacelli, 1996). The in vivo production of NO is proven 3 h following the i.g. administration of HU (80 - 1,020 mg/kg b.w.) to rats (Jiang, 1997).

- Excretion

Following the i.p. administration of 14 C labelled HU (500 mg/kg b.w.) to mice, urinary excretion of over 80% of radioactivity in 24 h is observed. Respiratory 14 CO2 accounts for 7% and only very small amounts (&lt;0.5%) appeared in the faeces (Adamson, 1965). In rats, the excretion pattern following i.p. administration of HU is similar to that of mice (Adamson, 1965).The portion of HU recovered in urine increases  according  to  dose;  i.e.,  from  30%  after  administration  of  46  mg/kg  b.w.  to  70%  after administration  of  1,840  mg/kg  b.w.,  respectively.  The  metabolic  process  could  be  operating  at  a maximal rate when tissue concentrations are high enough to saturate the enzyme system. In this case, renal excretion could be the dominant factor in the loss of HU. At lower concentrations metabolism could contribute more significantly to the excretion rate of HU (Philips, 1967). The elimination  of HU has  also been described by two pathways, one linear corresponding to renal excretion and the other nonlinear  and  consistent  with  Michaelis-Menten  kinetics  corresponding  to  metabolism  (Tracewell, 1994). Small amounts of HU are also secreted into breast milk with therapeutic dosing. At 1h after treatment  with  100  mg/kg  b.w.,  the  concentrations  in  the  embryos  exceed  the  maternal  plasma concentrations. The elimination half-lives in embryos are appreciably higher compared with maternal plasma half-life (Wilson, 1975).

## · Pharmacokinetic Drug interactions

Brain  uptake  of  [ 14 C]H is  affected  by  drug  interactions;  it  increases  by  200  µM  HU,  90  µM  D4T, 350 µM  probenecid,  25  µM  digoxin  but  not  by  120  µM  HU,  16.5  -  50  µM  D4T,  90  µM  2'3'dideoxyinosine  or  90  µM  abacavir.  [ 14 C]HU  distribution  to  the  CSF,  choroid  plexus  and  pituitary gland remains unaffected by these drugs (Dogruel, 2003).

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

No detailed single-dose study reports have been submitted for this marketing authorisation application. Available information in the public domain and the literature mainly using another product containing HU  approved  in  the  U.S.A.  (Hydrea,  Bristol  Myers  Squibb)  have  been  reviewed.  In  single-dose studies, mice and rats were exposed to single oral dose of HU and followed for a 14-day observation period.  The  acute  median  lethal  dose  was  within  5,000  to  15,000  mg/kg  b.w.  depending  on  animal species and route of administration. Deaths were observed after several days. The major clinical sign observed was aplasia. The oral LD50 of HU is 7,330 mg/kg b.w. in mice and 5,780 mg/kg b.w. in rats.

Additionally, in male rabbits receiving a single i.v. injection of 150 mg/kg b.w. HU solution, there was an early but transient significant decrease in blood erythrocyte count (approximately 30% lower at day 3  after  HU)  with  a  gradual  increase  in  their  osmotic  resistance,  a  suppression  of  granulocyte phagocytic  capacity  (approximately  50%  at  day  3),  and  a  rapid  increase  in  the  proportion  of lymphocytes without detectable lysosomes (2-fold at 24 h). Also, serum acid phosphatase activity was elevated at day 7 after HU, which may reflect a manifestation of cell injury. Histological analysis of the  liver  of  BALB/c  mice  analogously  treated  with  HU,  revealed  a  marked  hepatotoxicity  of  HU, manifested as dilation  of  the  intercell  cord  spaces  and  bile  capillaries,  the  appearance  of  numerous balloon cells, cells with pyknotic nuclei, undetectable nucleoli and necrosis; particularly in the centres of hepatic lobules. To explain the observed toxicities, it was hypothesised HU-initiated free radicalmediated reactions (Malec, 1989).

## · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

No detailed study reports for repeat-dose toxicity were submitted. The applicant reviewed available published information.

Twenty-eight day studies conducted in rats and dogs exposed to repeated oral or i.v. doses of HU up to 400  mg/kg  b.w./d.  demonstrated  a  dose-related  toxicity  in  both  species.  The  treatment-associated changes were characterised by a medullar aplasia, lymphoid depletion and a decrease in spermatogenesis. In rats receiving the highest doses, the only macroscopic observations were a thymic hypoplasia and a significant increase of bronchopulmonary infections. The deaths of animals appeared to be related to infections (Hydrea BMS, 1997).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In repeat-dose toxicity studies in the rat, the most consistent pathological findings were an apparent dose-related mild to moderate bone marrow hypoplasia as well as pulmonary congestion and mottling of the lungs. At the highest dosage levels (1,260 mg/kg b.w./d for 37 d then 2,520 mg/kg b.w./d for 40 d),  testicular  atrophy  with  absence  of  spermatogenesis  occurred;  in  several  animals,  hepatic  cell damage with fatty metamorphosis was noted.

In  the  dog,  mild  to  marked  bone  marrow  depression  was  a  consistent  finding  except  at  the  lower dosage levels. Additionally, at the higher dose levels (140 to 420 mg or 140 to 1,260 mg/kg b.w./week given 3 or 7 d weekly for 12 weeks), growth retardation, slightly increased blood glucose values, and haemosiderosis of the liver or spleen were found; reversible spermatogenic arrest was noted.

In the monkey, bone marrow depression, lymphoid atrophy of the spleen, and degenerative changes in the epithelium of the small and large intestines were found. At the higher, often lethal, doses (400 to 800  mg/kg  b.w./d  for  7  to  15  d),  haemorrhage  and  congestion  were  found  in  the  lungs,  brain,  and urinary tract.

In  the  above  studies  (i.e.,  40  d  rat  study,  12  week  dog  study,  and  7  -  15  d  monkey  study) cardiovascular effects (changes in heart rate, blood pressure, orthostatic hypotension, ECG changes) and  haematological  changes  (slight  haemolysis  and  slight  methaemoglobinaemia)  were  observed  in some species of laboratory animals (not specified) at doses exceeding clinical levels..

HU  induced  high  lethality  in  hypophysectomised  and  adrenalectomised  male  Wistar  rats,  whilst ablation of other endocrine glands had no effect on the toxicity of HU. Doses of 300 - 800 mg/kg b.w./d  HU  for  5  d  were  well  tolerated  by  intact  rats.  Following  300  and  800  mg/kg  b.w./d  HU, lethality  over  5  d  was  100%  and  71.4%,  respectively,  in  pituitary-ablated  rats.  In  similarly  treated adrenalectomised animals, lethalities were 63.3% and 72.7%, respectively (Navarra, 1990).

In repeat toxicity studies, effects on the circulatory system were observed.

## · Genotoxicity

Hydroxyurea  is  considered  a  genotoxic  agent,  as  established  from  genotoxic  studies  (Suter,  1990; Ziegler-Skylakakis, 1985; Sofuni, 1996; Wangenheim, 1988; Sherwood, 1988; Hart, 1983; Chlopkiewicz,  1982;  Lee,  2003),  an  its  likely  mechanisms  are  due  to  an  inhibitory  effect  on ribonucleotide  reductase  but  possibly  also  due  to  the  CYP-dependent  formation  of  genotoxic metabolites, namely hydrogen peroxide.

## · Carcinogenicity

Although conventional long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of HU have not been conducted,  HU  is  presumed  a  trans-species  carcinogen  as  evidenced  by  a  number  of  non-clinical studies (Chlopkiewicz, 1982; Muranyi-Kovacs, 1972; Weisburger, 1977). It is important to note that the World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) considers that HU is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans due to the inadequate experimental evidence. Therefore, a carcinogenic risk under the treatment with HU cannot be excluded.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

HU adversely affects reproductive performance in rats, as evidenced by the following studies (Droxia, BMS;  Evenson,  1992;  Spencer,  2000,  Chaube,  1966;  Wilson,  1975,  Aliverti,  1980;  Iwama,  1983; DeSesso, 2000; Chahoud, 2002; Woo, 2003; Woo, 2004; Butcher, 1972; Adlard, 1975). HU causes testicular atrophy, reducing sperm production in male rats while high doses induce high incidence of resorptions in rats on Day 7-11 of gestation. In male mice, HU at 500mg/kg b.w. causes up to 50% loss  of  testicular  weight  by  day  29.  HU  crosses  the  placental  barrier  and  damages  embryos  in  rats. Repeated oral administration of HU during the organogenetic period at dose levels ranging from 50450 mg/kg b.w. leads to a dose-dependent embryo-lethal and teratogenic effect with an evident dose response relationship. Live foetuses at term generally show severe ocular and craniofacial anomalies; hydrocephalus, cardiovascular abnormalities, vertebral and costal defects. Rat embryos are teratogenically more sensitive to HU than monkey embryos.

## · Toxicokinetic data

No toxicokinetic studies have been submitted for this marketing authorization.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Local tolerance

No local tolerance studies have been submitted for this marketing authorization.

- Other Toxicity Studies

No studies on antigenicity, immunotoxicity, dependence or metabolites have been submitted for this marketing authorization.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  has  been  calculated,  and  the  PEC  value  is  less  than 0.01ug/l.   Siklos is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage. No phase II environmental effect analysis has been submitted for this marketing authorization.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

The active substance of Siklos is hydroxycarbamide (HU), whose precise mechanism of action has not been  fully  elucidated.  HU  has  been  in  clinical  use  for  several  decades,  initially  for  treatment  of myeloproliferative disorders and later to reduce the frequency of painful crises in adult patients with SCS.  No  new  non-clinical  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  been  carried  out  by  the  applicant  to investigate  the  efficacy  of  Siklos,  as  the  clinical  utility  of  HU  has  already  been  demonstrated  in clinical  trials  and  clinical  practice  and  sufficient  information  is  available  in  the  scientific  literature. The  available  information  in  the  public  domain  and  the  literature  has  mainly  been  produced  using another product containing HU but is considered relevant for the current application. Additional nonclinical tests are not considered necessary.

Following oral administration, HU is readily absorbed and peak plasma levels are reached within 1-4h. With increasing dose, disproportionately greater mean peak plasma concentrations are observed. No data  on  protein  binding  of  HU  are  available.  HU  distributes  rapidly  and  the  volume  of  distribution approximates total body water.

The metabolism of HU is poorly characterized. It is assumed that urea is the main metabolite of HU. Since  the  enzymes  involved  in  the  biotransformation  process  have  not  been  defined,  possible  drug interactions  based  on  metabolizing  enzymes  such  as  CYP  isoenzymes,  cannot  be  excluded.  The elimination  half-life    of  HU  is  species-specific  (mice&lt;rat&lt;monkey)hinting  at  the  species-specific differences in metabolism and/or excretion pattern.

No detailed study reports of non-clinical toxicology studies have been submitted. Concerning singledose toxicity studies, clinical data on overdosing are available. Acute mucocutaneous toxicity has been reported in patients receiving hydroxycarbamide at dosages several times above the therapeutic dose. Soreness, violet erythema, oedema on palms and soles followed by scaling of hand and feet, severe generalised hyperpigmentation of the skin and stomatitis have been observed.

The repeated dose studies reviewed provide limited information about the chronic toxicity of the HU. The most common  effects noted included bone marrow  depression, lymphoid atrophy and degenerative changes in the epithelium of the small and large intestines. Cardiovascular effects and haematological changes were observed in some species. Also, in rats testicular atrophy with decreased spermatogenesis occurred, while in dogs reversible spermatogenic arrest was noted. safety pharmacology studies evaluating the effect of HU on the circulatory system have not been performed. Additional non-clinical toxicology tests are not considered necessary.

It is important to note that HU is unequivocally genotoxic in a wide range of test systems. However, conventional long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of hydroxycarbamide have not been performed. Intraperitoneal administration of 125-250 mg/kg HU (about 0.5-1 times the maximum recommended human oral daily dose on a mg/m2 basis) thrice weekly for 6 months to female rats increased the incidence of mammary tumors in rats surviving to 18 months compared to control. HU is presumed  to  be  a  human  carcinogen.  In  patients  receiving  long-term  HU  for  myeloproliferative disorders, secondary leukaemia has been reported. It is unknown whether this leukemogenic effect is secondary  to  HU  or  is  associated  with  the  patient's  underlying  disease.  Skin  cancer  has  also  been reported in patients receiving long-term HU.

No  non-clinical  study  to  determine  the  effect  on  prenatal  and  postnatal  development  has  been submitted. Very few clinical data are available on the human growth and development after in utero

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

exposure and/or exposure during lactation. However, this information has been adequately refelected in the SPC and additional non-clinical studies are not required.

Local  tolerance  has  not  been  studied  non-clinically.  Administering  the  broken  tablets  with  a  small amount of food could minimise the contact of HU with the mucous membrane of the mouth and the throat. According to the environmental risk assessment, it may be assumed that Siklos is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment following its prescribed use in patients.

## Clinical aspects

## Introduction

Published pharmacokinetic data on hydroxyurea/hydroxycarbamide (HU) has been evaluated in cancer patients. However, to fill the gap of published data on the pharmacokinetics of HU particularly in SCS patients, an additional pharmacokinetic study meeting recent quality standards, has provided valid data on key pharmacokinetic endpoints i.e. absorption, distribution and excretion of HU in children as well as  in  adults  under  pseudo-steady-state  conditions.  This  study  also  includes  a  bioequivalence  study between the HU breakable tablets (Siklos) and HU capsules (Hydrea) in adults and of HU breakable tablets in children and adolescents of both genders with SCS.

## Pharmacokinetics

In support of this marketing application, the following pharmacokinetic study was conducted:

- 1 multiple-dose study in SCS patients (5.3.1.2 Siklos)

In  total,  the  following  studies  with  HU  have  been  conducted-  including  4  studies  in  patients  with cancer, 2 studies in patients with HIV, and 2 studies in patients with SCS. The table below summarizes the results.

## · Absorption

After oral administration of 20 mg/kg of hydroxycarbamide, a rapid absorption is observed with peak plasma levels of about 30 mg/l occurring after 0.75 and 1.2 h in children and adult patients with Sickle Cell Syndrome, respectively. Low trough HU concentrations were reported at values of 14.3 µmol in children and 11.18 µmol/l in adults. The total exposure up to 24 h post-dose is 124 mg*h/l in children

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and  adolescents  and  135  mg*h/l  in  adult  patients.  The  oral  bioavailability  of  hydroxycarbamide  is almost complete as assessed in indications other than Sickle Cell Syndrome.

No data on the effect of food on the absorption of HU have been submitted.

The pharmacokinetic data were similar after intake of HU breakable tablets and HU capsules in adult patients with SCD.

## · Distribution

No clinical studies have been submitted to evaluate the distribution of HU in SCS patients. Based on published reports, HU distributes rapidly throughout the human body, enters the cerebrospinal fluid, appears in peritoneal fluid and ascites, and concentrates in leukocytes and erythrocytes. The estimated volume  of  distribution  of  hydroxycarbamide  approximates  total  body  water. The  volume  of distribution  at  steady  state  adjusted  for  bioavailability  is  0.57  l/kg  in  patients  with  Sickle  Cell Syndrome (amounting to approximately 72 and 90 l in children and adults, respectively). The extent of protein binding of hydroxycarbamide is unknown. The distribution of of HU in cerebrospinal fluid is presented in different studies with contradictory results.

## · Metabolism

The biotransformation  pathways  as  well  as  the  metabolites  are  not  fully  characterised.  Urea  is  one metabolite of hydroxycarbamide. Hydroxycarbamide at 30, 100 and 300µM is not metabolised in vitro by  cytochrome  P450s  of  human  liver  microsomes.  At  concentrations  ranging  from  10  to  300  µM, hydroxycarbamide  does  not  stimulate  the  in  vitro  ATPase  activity  of  recombinant  human  P glycoprotein (PGP), indicating that hydroxycarbamide is not a PGP substrate. Hence, no interaction is to be expected in case of concomitant administration with substances being substrates of cytochromes P450 or P-glycoprotein.

- Elimination

The  applicant  submitted  a  study  report  on  renal  excretion.  36.9%  and  58.32%  of  the  dose  were detected in urine in children and in adults respectively.

In  a  repeated  dose  study  in  adult  patients  with  Sickle  Cell  Syndrome  approximately  60%  of  the hydroxycarbamide dose was detected in urine at steady state. In adults the total clearance adjusted for bioavailability was 9.89 l/h (0.16 l/h/kg) thereof 5.64 and 4.25 l/h by renal and non-renal clearance, respectively. The respective value for total clearance in children was 7.25 l/h (0.20 l/h/kg) with 2.91 and 4.34 l/h by renal and non-renal pathways.

In adults with Sickle Cell Syndrome, mean cumulative urinary hydroxycarbamide excretion was 62 % of the administered dose at 8 hours, and thus higher than in cancer patients (35 - 40 %). In patients with Sickle Cell Syndrome hydroxycarbamide was eliminated with a half-life of approximately six to seven hours, which is longer than reported in other indications.

- Dose proportionality and time dependencies

No studies were submitted about dose proportionality and time dependencies.

- Special populations

Geriatric,  Gender,  Race: No information is available  regarding  pharmacokinetic  differences  due  to age (except paediatric patients), gender or race.

Paediatric: In  paediatric  and  adult  patients  with  Sickle  Cell  Syndrome  the  systemic  exposure  to hydroxycarbamide at steady state was similar by means of the area under the curve. The maximum plasma levels and the apparent volume of distribution related to body weight were well comparable between age groups. The time to reach maximum plasma concentration and the percentage of the dose excreted in urine were increased in children compared to adults. In paediatric patients the half-life was slightly longer and the total clearance related to body weight slightly higher than in adult patients (see SPC section 4.2).

Renal impairment: As renal excretion is a pathway of elimination, consideration should be given to decreasing  the  dosage  of  Siklos  in  patients  with  renal  impairment.  In  an  open  single-dose  study  in adult  patients  with  Sickle  Cell  Syndrome  the  influence  of  renal  function  on  pharmacokinetics  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hydroxycarbamide was assessed. Patients with normal (creatinine clearance CrCl &gt; 80 ml/min), mild (CrCl 60 - 80 ml/min), moderate (CrCl 30 - &lt;60 ml/min), or severe (&lt;30 ml/min) renal impairment received hydroxycarbamide as a single dose of 15 mg/kg b.w. by using 200 mg, 300 mg, or 400 mg capsules. In patients, whose CrCl was below 60 ml/min or patients with end-stage renal disease the mean  exposure  to  hydroxycarbamide  was  approximately  64%  higher  than  in  patients  with  normal renal function. As evaluated in a further study, in patients with a CrCl &lt;60 ml/min the area under the curve was approximately 51% higher than in patients with a CrCl ≥ 60 ml/min, which suggests that a dose reduction of hydroxycarbamide by 50% may be appropriate in patients with a CrCl &lt; 60 ml/min. Haemodialysis reduced the exposure to hydroxycarbamide by 33% (see SPC sections 4.2 and 4.4)

Close monitoring of haematological parameters is advised in these patients.

Hepatic  impairment: There  are  no  data  that  support  specific  guidance  for  dosage  adjustment  in patients  with  hepatic  impairment,  but,  due  to  safety  considerations,  Siklos  is  contraindicated  in patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  (see  SPC  section  4.2).  Close  monitoring  of  haematological parameters is advised in patients with hepatic impairment.

- Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

There  are  no  data  on  the  concomitant  use  of  HU  with  other  drugs  in  humans;  there  are  also  no prospective studies on the potential for HU to interact with other drugs. However, no case reports on interactions are present in the databases, indicating that there is no high potential for interactions.

- Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

No studies have been conducted to assess the pharmacokinetics of HU, using human biomaterials.

## Pharmacodynamics

- Mechanism of action

HU belong to the pharmacotherapeutic group of 'other antineoplastic agents', ATC code: L01XX05. The mechanism of action of HU in SCD is not definitely known.

- Primary pharmacology

## Decrease of neutrophil counts

While the impact of HU in SCS was initially thought to be attributed to the rise in HbF, further study has  revealed  that  while  HbF  appeared  to  play  a  significant  role  in  early  improvement  in  treated patients, the clinical response from three months of treatment was more significantly associated with a reduction in neutrophil count. Interestingly, after two years of treatment, half of the patients had no increase  or  only  trivial  increments  in  HbF  despite  significant  amelioration  of  the  disease  in  the treatment group (Davies, 2003).  Although the reduction in neutrophils on treatment is a result of the cytotoxicity of HU, it is also suggested that the association of crisis rate with neutrophil count is a biological phenomenon. High neutrophil counts were associated with a worse clinical prognosis and earlier  death.  Therefore,  neutropenic  effects  of  HU  may  also  be  important  in  the  reduction  of symptoms. Neutrophils are known to adhere to vascular endothelium thus potentially  impeding  the flow of the sickle cells; neutrophils can also increase blood viscosity, release cytokines and are also involved in the inflammatory response. Finally, adherence of sickle cells to neutrophils followed by activation and production of toxic oxygen radicals has also been reported (Davies, 2003).

## Increased synthesis of NO

Patients  taking  HU show a significant  increase in iron nitrosyl haemoglobin and plasma nitrite and nitrate within 2 h of ingestion, providing evidence for the in vivo conversion of HU to NO. Formation of  NO  from  HU  may  explain  a  portion  of  the  observed  effects  of  HU  treatment  (King,  2003). Although, at present, the mechanism (or mechanisms) of NO release, the identity of the in vivo oxidant and the site of metabolism remain to be identified, recent evidence suggests several lines of evidence for an involvement of NO. It has been shown that HU can be oxidized by haem groups to produce the free-radical gas molecule NO in vivo (Jiang, 1997; Glover, 1999). Advantages of NO production in SCS  include  a major role in maintaining vascular tone, a possible inhibitory role  in  HbS polymerisation,  inhibition  of  platelet  aggregation,  as  anti-adhesive  therapy  for  ischaemia/perfusion injury and by improving endothelial function (Hong, 2002; Davies, 2003).

## Reduction in red cell - endothelial adhesion

In patients with homozygous sickle cell disease, within two weeks of commencing HU therapy and prior to any rise in HbF, sickle erythrocytes showed reduced adhesion to endothelial cells under low shear flow conditions. The lower adhesion of sickle RBCs to endothelium may facilitate escape from the microcirculation before polymerisation begins (Bridges, 1996).

## Effects on sickle red cell rheology

Erythrocyte  hydration  status  and  deformability  can  be  increased  by  HU  (Adragna,  1994;  Brugnara, 2001; Ballas, 2002; Davies, 2003). The effect of HU with respect to mean corpuscular volume was investigated  in  patients  with  sickle  cell  anaemia.  The  following  pattern  was  seen  in  the  sickle  cell patients during HU treatment. Although the mean corpuscular volume of their RBCs increased, there was no change in mean corpuscular Hb concentration, ion content or mean density. A notable change in the sickle cell patients' blood was that two subpopulations of cells were almost eliminated during HU  treatment;  the  hypodense  reticulocyte  fraction and  the hyperdense  fraction that contains irreversibly sickled cells. Therefore, the beneficial effect of HU might be due not only to an increase in HbF alone, but perhaps also to the associated increase in mean corpuscular volume or the altered RBC density profile (Orringer, 1991).

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

The  inhibition of ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase has also enabled the use of  HU  in myeloproliferative disorders such as chronic myelogenous leukaemia and polycythaemia rubra vera. HU is anti-mitotic and cytotoxic depending on the concentration used, the duration of exposure, and the  sensitivity  of  the  organism.  HU  has  also  been  investigated  in  the  treatment  of  various  solid tumours such as malignant melanoma, refractory ovarian cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, renal cell carcinoma, transition cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder and advanced prostate cancer.  The  use  of  HU  at  low  concentrations  has  also  been  used  to  re-establish  tumor sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents or to decrease tumourigenicity (Timson, 1975; Gwilt, 1998; Hong, 2002).  In addition, HU is also used to treat plaque psoriasis, usually at the dose of 500mg to  1g  orally  daily,  in  patients  resistant  to  other  therapies  such  as  methotrexate,  acitretin  or phototherapy. In psoriasis, HU is though to work by reducing the replication of DNA within the basal cell of the epidermis. HU has known adverse effects such as temporarily lowering the number of white blood  cells  (increasing  the  chance  of  getting  an  infection)  and  lowering  the  number  of  platelets (impairing proper blood clotting). The major secondary pharmacodynamic effect observed with HU is haematological toxicity and results from a bone marrow suppression.

## Discussion on clinical Pharmacology

## · Pharmacokinetics

HU  is well-established in SCS and is therapeutically used over a long time. Additional pharmacokinetic studies on these objectives are unlikely to produce information altering the clinical use of HU, since the side effects and the conditions of clinical use of HU are already well-known from long-term use in cancer as well as in SCS.

The pharmacokinetics have been adequately studied in the target population, i.e. in children. The mean age of children and adolescents was 10.25 years. The pharmacokinetic data were similar after intake of HU breakable tablets and HU capsules in adult patients with SCD.

The  trough  levels  of  HU  were  rather  low  in  children  when  compared  with  adults.  The  once  daily administration could be questioned based on T1/2. The half-life doubled in patients treated by HU for SCD, when compared with that in patients treated by HU for other diseases. The Applicant should discuss the major difference.

There  were  no  significant  differences  between  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  HU  in  adults  and  in children. The Applicant has given no data on the influence of food on HU absorption.

A  non-linear  relationship  between  plasma  HU  concentrations  and  dose  is  apparent  in  nearly  every animal and human pharmacokinetic study. The Applicant should discuss this special relationship, and also  comment  on  the  two  following  points.  Is  there  a  plasma  concentration  threshold  to  ensure  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

therapeutic  efficacy?  Recently,  an  author  suggested  that  the  marked  differences  in  urinary  HU concentrations could explain some of the differences in response to HU.

It  has  been demonstrated that the half-life of HU is longer is patients with renal impairment. In the SPC,  HU  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  (creatinine  clearance  &lt;  30 ml/min),  while  a  dose  reduction  (by  50%)  is  recommended  in  patients  with  renal  impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min). These recommendations are deemed sufficient to ensure the safety of HU in patients with renal impairment.

## · Pharmacodynamics

HbF seems to be a good surrogate of HU efficacy in SCD. No severe adverse effects consecutive to vaccination with live vaccines have been reported in children with SCD, the patient should undergo the recommended vaccination programs including live vaccines.

As no data are provided on the interaction of HU with HIV drugs, the Applicant has committed itself to collect these data as part of the Risk Management Plan.

The Applicant has initiated an update of the two existing registries, the French patient registry and the Belgian paediatric cohort to provide data on the long-term efficacy and safety of HU. In the Belgian cohort 155  patient-years  corresponded  to  a  HU  dose  of  20  to  25  mg/kg/day  and  42  patient-years corresponded to HU doses higher than 25 mg/kg/day. At one year, 85% (92/109) of patients had no major  events  requiring  hospitalisation,  while  at  6  and  8  years  25%  and  36%  remained  event-free, respectively. In the French cohort the comparison of a 7-day /week and a 4-day/week regime of HU revealed no difference with regards to tolerability, but failure rate was lower with the former regime (12/138 [8.7%] versus 14/45 [31%], p&lt;0.001).

In  the  Belgian  registry,  93  patients  with  SCD  were  followed  (see  table  8).  Seven  children  were younger than 2 years at enrolment, 20 were between 2 and 5 years, 33 between 5 and 9 years, 27 between 10 and 19 years, and 6 were 20 years or older. The initial HU dose was 20 mg/kg/day and could be escalated by 5 mg/kg based on physician's judgment. At the end of the first year 55% of patients  were  treated  with  20  to  25  mg/kg/day,  41%  with  &lt;  20  mg/kg/day,  and  4%  with  25  to  30 mg/kg/day (n=1:&gt;30).This distribution remained unchanged during the following years. During first, second, third, forth and fifth year of HU treatment 84%, 79%, 81%, 90% and 74% of patients were free  of  VOCs  requiring  hospitalisations.  The  number  of  hospitalisations  significantly  declined  from the year prior to study to the end of the first year (p=0.0002), whereas no significant differences were observed in year-to-year comparisons from year 1 to 5.

In parallel to the French paediatric registry, 43 of 202 children with SCD followed-up in a paediatric clinic in France were treated with HU since 1992 during at least 12 months. Compared to baseline a significant  decrease  of  hospitalisation  number  (1.12  versus  2.85/year),  hospitalisation  days  (6.43 d/year versus 19.45 d/year), VOCs (1.27/year versus 2.34/year) and ACSs (0.12/year versus 0.41/year, all p&lt;0.001) was seen under HU. The responsible was variable with full success in 40% of patients, partial success in 21%, transitory success in 14%, and failure in 23%. The initial HbF was the only factor predictive of response (p=0.04). Haematological toxicity requiring withdrawal of HU was not observed.

In Israel, nineteen children and adolescents with a history of at least three acute painful events (severe VOC or ACS) per year were followed over a 2-year period. The children received HU with a mean of 21.3 mg/kg/day (16.4 to 31.2). A severe VOC was defined as an event requiring hospitalisation or a home crisis requiring analgesics for more than 24 hours. The mean follow-up was 40.2 months (20 to 66).  HU considerably decreased all clinical endpoints. In patients with HbSS the VOC rate and the duration of hospital stay decreased more markedly than in points with compound heterozygous SCD (see table 9).

To summarise, in all clinical trials reduced SCD relevant outcomes were observed, such as VOCS, frequency of ACSs, hospital days, and also transfusion requirements.  However, the efficacy of HU in stroke prevention has not been demonstrated.

Medium HU doses are effective in the majority of patients. This point is supported by the analysis of haematological  response  in  the  MSH  study  (Charache,  1996).  The  patients  were  stratified  by  HbF response (4 quartiles)  and in the quartile with the highest HbF response 66% and 20% of patients received 15 to22.2 and 25 to 32.5 mg/kg/day HU, respectively (12% &lt; 15, 3% 35 mg/kg/day). Among the patients with the lowest or no HbF response, 35% were treated with 35 mg/kg/day. In the Belgian cohort (426 patient-years) 229 patient-years corresponded to less than 20 mg/kg/day HU, 155 to 20 to 25 mg/kg/day, and 42 to HU doses above 25 mg/kg/day.  A predominance of medium initial HU dose was also seen in the French cohort.

In several studies HU does were increased as long as pre-defined myelosuppression was absent up to a maximum dose.

In the MSH Study, statistical analysis revealed no change of the beneficial clinical effect of HU during two years of treatment. Clinical response began to emerge within two months and evident at 4 months. In the Belgian cohort the cumulative probability of not experiencing any event during at least 5 years of HU treatment was 47%. A sustained clinical benefit was demonstrated for HU in patients remaining

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

on treatment for up to 8 years. In the French cohort, there was a secondary failure with recurrence of painful  events  after  6  to  82  months  in  10  patients  (7.5%).No  reasons  therefore  were  identified. However, especially in the French adult cohort non-compliance was a major problem.

In total, 378 children were followed in these studies during 6 months to 7 years. All studies were open label trials or extensions for long-term use of HU, but one study was a double-bind, placebo-controlled trial ( Ferster , 1996). In this study, the change in HbF value was highly significant and correlated with the increase of MCV. In addition, in 16 patients, a complete disappearance of vaso-occlusive events requiring  hospitalisation  occurred  within  the  first  month  of  HU  treatment.  However,  6  patients experienced no relevant change in the number of crises requiring hospitalisation. In these 6 patients, the HbF level only slightly increased from 1.7% to 3.2%. The percentage of non-responders was thus 27%. Overall, the number of hospitalisations was reduced when patients were on HU therapy when compared with placebo. 16 of 22 patients did not require any hospitalisation for painful episodes when treated with HU as compared with only 3 of 22 when treated with placebo. The number of days in hospital  was  also  significantly  lower  when  patients were  on  HU  therapy  (range,  0  to  19  days)  than when they were on placebo (range, 0 to 104 days).

In  most  other  studies,  there  was  a  significant  increase  in  HbF  from  baseline  after  use  of  HU.  This increase was highly significant at 6 months. In the two extension studies (Hankins, 2005; Zimmerman, 2004) the mean percentage HbF values were sustained at approximately 20% even after 7 years of continuous  HU  therapy.  The threshold  of  HbF for  obtaining  clinical  efficacy  could  be  comprised between  15  and  20%.  Finally,  the  response  on  HbF  levels  could  be  improved  by  increase  the  HU dosage,  from  20mg/kg/day  till  35mg/kg/day.  Only  in  one  study  (Maier-Redelsperger,  1998),  the maximal dose of 40 mg/kg/day, as it is stated in the SPC, was reached.

The haemoglobin level also increased in all clinical studies and was sustained over the 7-year period.

In all studies where it was evaluated, the frequency of VOC decreased dramatically (by 66% to 80%), after the use of HU. The same dramatic response was observed for the number of hospital admissions and the number days of hospitalisation .  Finally, the number of ACS (Acute Chest Syndrome)/year decreased  by  25  to 33%.  Considering  that  there are non-responders  to  the treatment, these improvements do demonstrate the overall efficacy of HU therapy. The remaining questions concern the actual link between HbF and efficacy (see the pharmacodynamics) and the ideal therapeutic dosage of HU.

The influence of the HU treatment on stroke has  not  been  fully  assessed  by  the  Applicant.  OheneFrempong (1998) emphasised the high incidence of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in SCD patients. The highest rates of prevalence of CVA (4.01%) and incidence (0.61 per 100 patient-years) were in sickle  cell  anaemia  (SS)  patients,  but  CVA  occurred  in  all  common  genotypes.  The  MSH  study (Charache, 1995) did not show a statistical reduction in stroke. Halsey (2003) considered that there is no  evidence  that  HU  can  reduce  the  incidence  of  first  or  recurrent  strokes.  Ware  et  al  (1999) discontinued transfusions and gave HU to 16 paediatric patients with SCD and stroke. HU was started at 15 mg/kg/day and escalated to 30 mg/kg/day based on haematological toxicity. The results suggest that HU may be effective in the clinical setting of CVA disease in patients with SCD. The mechanisms by which HU might provide protection against stroke recurrence are not known, but the increase in HbF levels is likely to be important in the prevention of in vivo sickling within the stenotic cerebral vessels. In this study, the patients achieved an average %HbF of approximately 20%.

Platt (1994) followed 3,764 patients who ranged from birth to 66 years of age and investigated the circumstances of death for all 209 patients who died during the study. The median age of death was 60 years  for  males  and  68  years  for  females.  Among  adults  with  SCD,  18%  of  the  deaths  occurred  in patients with overt organ failure, predominantly renal. 33% were clinically free or organ failure but died during an acute sickle crisis (78% had pain, the chest syndrome, or both; 22% had stroke). Thus the acute chest syndrome, renal failure, seizures, a baseline white-cell count above 15,000 cells/mm 3 , and a low level of foetal haemoglobin were associated with an increased risk of early death. In the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (Gill, CSSCD , 1995), 694 infants with confirmed SCD were enrolled at less than 6 months of age. The nature and the frequency of complications were followed prospectively over a 10-year period. Painful crises and acute chest syndrome were the most common sickle cell-related events. The mortality rate was low in this cohort: 20 children, all with HbSS, died. Infection,  most  commonly  with  Streptococcus  pneumoniae  and  Haemophilus  influenzae,  caused  11

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

deaths.  Two  children  died  of  splenic  sequestration,  1  of  cerebrovascular  accident,  and  6  of  unclear causes. The mortality rate was highest between 6 months and 3 years of age. On the other hand, a WBC &gt; 15 x 10 9 is associated with an increased risk of early death in SCD (Charache, 1996).

Acute  chest  syndrome  is  a  significant  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality  in  SCD.  Solis  et  al  (2005) performed  a  retrospective  review  of  all  the  episodes  of  ACS  diagnosed  in  their  center  in  patients younger than 18 years with SCD. 23 episodes of ACS were evaluated in 8 out of 12 patients with SCD. The most frequent cause was infection. The most frequent symptoms were fever (87%), cough (61%) and cold (35%) symptoms. Children aged more than 3 years old had more severe episodes, with greater clinical compromise and radiological involvement and increased use of analgesia.

Steinberg et  al  (2003) conducted a study to determine whether HU attenuates mortality in  patients with SCD (patients from the MSH study). 299 adult patients with frequent painful episodes enrolled in the follow-up. Patients were randomly assigned to receive HU (n=152) or placebo (n=147). 75 of the patients died, 28% from pulmonary disease. Patients with reticulocyte counts less than 250,000/mm 3 and haemoglobin levels lower than 9 g/dl had increased mortality. Individuals who had acute chest syndrome during the trial had 32% mortality compared with 18% of individuals without acute chest syndrome.  Patients  with  3  or  more  painful  episodes  per  year  during  the  trial  had  27%  mortality compared with 17% of patients with less frequent episodes. Taking HU was associated with a 40% reduction  in  mortality (p=0.04). Cumulative mortality at 9 years was 28% when HbF levels were lower than 0.5 g/dl after the trial was completed compared with 15% when HbF levels were 0.5 g/dl or higher  (p=0.03).  These  findings  occurred  in  adults;  how  HU  affects  mortality  in  young  children  is unknown. Nevertheless, these observations confirm the link of HbF to mortality in SCD and suggest that the ability of HU to increase levels of HbF may be associated with reduced mortality. The authors found  no  relationship  between  decrements  in  neutrophil  counts  and  mortality,  but  the  Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD, Gill, 1995) found that lower leukocyte counts were associated with longevity.

In two cases, chronic HU therapy has reversed splenic dysfunction (Claster, 1996). Splenic infarction is of great concern to providers who car for young children with SCD. The exact mechanism of the HU-induced effect on the spleen is unclear. The reversal of splenic dysfunction induced by HU in two young adults suggests a clearly positive expected effect when HU is administered to children. Early HU  therapy  might  prevent  functional  hyposplenism  in  this  group  of  patients.  Wang  et  al  (2001) reported  a  lower  frequency  of  functional  asplenia  (47%)  in  children  compared  with  the  expected frequency  from  historical  data  of  80%  as  assessed  by  radionucleotide  scanning.  This  fact  was confirmed by the extension study HUSOFT (Hankins, 2005), suggesting that HU therapy can prevent loss of spleen function or even restore it.

Quality  of  life  data are  mentioned  in  the  MSH  study  (Charache,  1995).  These  are  presented  as changes in baseline of three measures from the 'Health Status Survey' (nine scales), the 'Profile of Mood States' (four scales) and the 'Ladder of Life'. At 12 months general health perception was 1.6 above baseline in the treated group and 1.0 in the placebo group. A later report from the MSH study reported marginal but not significant improvement in general health perception at the end of the study (Cochrane, 2005).

## Adults

The applicant has submitted all clinical studies performed in adults based on the published literature.

MSH study, a double-blind randomized study, has enrolled SCD adult patients with severe disease (at least 3 painful crises per year). It has assigned hydroxycarbamide to 152 patients and placebo to 147 controls.  Patients  given  hydroxycarbamide  received  an  initial  dose  of  15  mg/kg/day,  which  was increased by 5 mg /kg/d every 12 weeks unless marrow depression occurred (indicated by neutrophil count &lt; 2.0 x 109/L, reticulocyte or platelet count &lt;80 x 109/L, or Hb level &lt;4.5 g/dl,). In the case of marrow depression, treatment was stopped until the blood count recovered and was then resumed at a dose  2.5  mg/kg  lower  than  that  associated  with  marrow  depression.  This  defined  the  maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The hydroxycarbamide-treated patients had a lower annual rate of crises than the controls (2.5 vs 4.5 crises per year, p&lt;0.001), fewer patients had chest syndrome (25 events vs 51, p &lt;0.001), and fewer underwent transfusions (48 vs 73, p = 0.001). The study was early discontinued because of the benefits observed in the treated patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

430 adult patients were enrolled in several clinical studies, confirming these findings.

The  Applicant  has  also  initiated  a  retrospective,  uncontrolled,  multicentric  follow  up  registry  in  2 hospitals  in  France.  The  objective  of  this  retrospective  open  follow  up  in  adults  diagnosed  with homozygous sickle cell syndrome and treated off-label with hydroxycarbamide was to collect data on the  long  term  safety  and  efficacy  of  this  treatment  and  provide  updates  which  would  complete information already reported in the literature.  The data of 123 adult SS patients have been collected. The hydroxycarbamide treatment was maintained in 76% of patients, with 41 patients (33%) treated for more than 5 years and 11 of them (9%) treated with HU for more than 10 years, with no serious toxicity  related  to  HU.  Mean  dose  (±SD)  of  HU  was  16.4  ±  5.8  mg/kg/day  at  the beginning of  the treatment  and  18.5  ±  6.3  mg/kg/day  at  the  end  of  the  follow-up,  with  approximately  two-thirds  of patients receiving a daily HU dosage in the 15 to 25 mg/kg range. in terms of number of VOC with hospitalisation  and  HbF  rate  growth,  the  results  were  supportive  of    the  efficacy  in  adult  patients described in the literature.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

No detailed clinical study report on clinical efficacy have been submitted. HU has been in clinical use for  several  decades,  initially  for  treatment  of  myeloproliferative  disorders  and  later  to  reduce  the frequency  of  painful  crises  in  adult  patients  with  SCS.  No  additional  clinical  efficacy  studies  are considered necessary. The applicant has presented bibliographic data for a total of 378 children who were followed in these studies during 6 months to 7 years.

In  most  clinical  studies,  there  was  a  significant  increase  in  HbF  from  baseline  after  HU  use.  This increase was highly significant at 6 months. In the two extension studies (Hankins, 2005; Zimmerman, 2004) the mean percentage HbF values were sustained at approximately 20% even after 7 years of continuous  HU  therapy.  The  threshold  of  HbF  for  obtaining  clinical  efficacy  could  be  comprised between 15 and 20%. Finally, the response on HbF levels could be improved by an increase the HU dosage, from 20 mg/kg/day up to 35 mg/kg/day.

In  all  studies  where  it  was  evaluated,  the  frequency  of  VOC  (Vaso-Occlusive  Crises)  decreased dramatically (by 66% to 80%), after the use of HU. The same dramatic response was observed for the number of hospital admissions and the number of days of hospitalisation. Finally, the number of ACS (Acute Chest Syndrome)/year decreased by 25 to 33%. Non-responders to the HU treatment reached 27% of the patients (children). The definitive clinical, pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic reasons underlying this non-response are unknown. A sustained clinical benefit was demonstrated for HU in patients remaining on treatment for up to 8 years.

The  influence  of  the  HU  treatment  on  stroke  has  not  been  fully  assessed  by  the  Applicant.  The applicant agreed that this should be done in the postmarketing surveillance Programme.

Quality of life data are sparse in adult clinical trials and absent in paediatric studies.

As  the  maximum  dose  of  40  mg/kg/day  has  only  been  evaluated  in  one  study,  the  maximum therapeutic dose recommended is 35 mg/kg/day (under exceptional circumstances a maximum dose of 35 mg/kg b.w./day might be justified under close haematological monitoring, see SPC section 4.2). Moreover, the dose higher than 30 mg/kg/day should be exceptionally used, and only when there is a clearly increased clinical response to this dosage.

As  only  children  older  than  2  years  have  been  followed  in  the  main  clinical  studies,  SPC recommendations about age in the section posology limit the use of HU to children older than 2 years.

## Clinical safety

## · Patient exposure

Specifically  the  safety  of  hydroxycarbamide  had  been  examined  retroactively  from  cohorts  of 123 adults and 352 paediatric patients, over 13 years and up to 12 years respectively.

## · Adverse events

The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  reaction  is  myelosuppression  with  neutropenia  as  the  most common manifestation. Bone marrow depression is the dose-limiting toxic effect of hydroxycarbamide. When the maximum tolerated dose is not reached transient myelotoxicity usually occurs  in  less  than  10%  of  patients,  while  under  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  more  than  50%  can experience  reversible  bone  marrow  suppression.  These  adverse  reactions  are  expected  based  on  the pharmacology of hydroxycarbamide. Gradual dose titration may help to diminish these effects (see section 4.2).

The adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to treatment are listed below by body system organ  class  and  absolute  frequency.  Frequencies  are  defined  as  very  common  (&gt;1/10),  common ( ≥ 1/100, &lt;1/10), uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000, &lt;1/100), rare ( ≥ 1/10,000, &lt;1/1,000), very rare (&lt;1/10,000), not known  (cannot  be  estimated  form  the  available  data).  Within  each  frequency  grouping,  adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness:

1 Haematological recovery usually occurs within two weeks of withdrawal of hydroxycarbamide.

2 The macrocytosis caused by hydroxycarbamide is not vitamin B12 or folic acid dependent.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3 Mainly due to an infection with Parvovirus or a splenic sequestration.

- 4 Oligospermia and azoospermia are in general reversible, but have to be taken into account when fatherhood is desired (see section 5.3). These disorders are also associated with the underlying disease.
- 5 Which may be an effect of improved general conditions.

The clinical data obtained in patients with Sickle Cell Syndrome have not shown evidence of adverse effects of hydroxycarbamide on hepatic and renal function.

Additional  adverse  reactions  associated  with  the  use  of  hydroxycarbamide  in  the  treatment  of neoplastic  diseases  (doses  usually  above  40  mg/kg  b.w./d)  include  hypersensitivity  to  the  active substance,  anorexia,  hallucinations,  disorientation,  seizures,  dizziness,  acute  pulmonary  syndrome (diffuse pulmonary infiltrations, dyspnoea), allergic alveolitis, diarrhoea, constipation, maculo-papular rash,  facial  and  peripheral  erythema,  skin  cancer,  actinic  keratosis,  leg  ulcer,  cutaneous  vasculitic toxicities, including vasculitic ulcerations and gangrene, hyperpigmentation, violet papules, skin and nail atrophy, scaling, dermatomyositis-like skin changes, pruritus, asthenia, dysuria, renal impairment, increased blood bilirubin, (transient) increased blood urea, blood uric acid and blood creatinine, fever, chills, malaise.

- Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

In the clinical trials, no deaths were attributed to HU .

RENAL TOXICITY. HU was not directly associated with any significant renal toxicity, but it has not been able to prevent the progression of renal damage which is an inevitable late feature of SCD.

HEPATIC  TOXICITY.  In  a  number  of  cases,  administration  of  HU  was  associated  with  a  slight elevation  of  the  hepatic  enzymes.  This  was  reversible  and  did  not  cause  any  additional  problems. However, this finding cannot always be ascribed solely to HU,  as the fetal involvement is SCD is a common and unpredictable feature.

CUTANEOUS  OR  ORAL  REACTIONS.  These  are  already  known  from  the  long  use  of  HU  in haematological malignancies and were noted also in the SCD reports. Most of them, including ungual and  cutaneous  pigmentation,  cutaneous  xerosis,  palmar-plantar  keratoma,  oral  pigmentation,  mouth ulcers, and ichthyosis were acceptable and did not require discontinuation of therapy; however,  this was not the case with leg ulcers which are considered as a major side effect of the drug and led, at least in some instances to definitive or temporary discontinuation of therapy. Of course, here again the causative  contribution  of  persisting  venous  stasis,  capillary  occlusion  by  the  sickled  red  cells  and inevitable skin infection cannot be ignored and make the evaluation of the toxicity of HU extremely difficult. There were no substantial differences with regards to dose of HU and severity of the above complications between adults and children.

LEUKEMOGENESIS; CARCINOGENICITY.  Non- clinical experimental reports clearly associate HU with a number of chromosomal abnormalities; there also reports that patients with polycythemia vera or essential thrombocytocytosis treated with HU over several years have more probabilities of developing leukaemia in comparison to patients who have not received this medication.  However, the occurrence of neoplastic disease in adult SCD patients who received HU over long periods of time was not higher than that of the control population. It is important to note that there is laboratory  evidence of  increased  DNA  mutations  (illegitimate  VDJ  rearrangements  or ras mutations)  in  HU-treated children, however, in a study of 26 children who had been exposed to HU for a period of 5 years and no child on HU acquired leukaemia (Hanft et al., 2000).Therefore, an increase in somatic mutations does not directly portrend leukaemia.

- Laboratory findings

Myelosuppression is the main adverse event encountered in the clinical trials, and is clearly linked to dosage  of  HU.  The  incidence  of  myelosuppression  could  reach  80%  of  patients  at  the  maximal tolerated dose, while it occurred at a much lower incidence in the studies or patient registries in which HU dose was not increased until toxicity occurred.

LEUKOPENIA / NEUTROPENIA. This has been reported consistently in all studies.  In most cases it occurred when the dose of HU exceeded the conventional daily dose of 20 mg/kg b.w.; however, in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

some cases it  was  unpredictably  observed    with  lower  doses,  thus  making  blood  counts  mandatory every  week  at  the  beginning  and  bi-or  tri-weekly  thereafter.  Leukopenia  was  promptly  reversed  on discontinuation of HU in all reported cases. In a couple of cases, considering the benefit of preventing the  VOC  crises,  recurrent  leukopenia  led  to  splenectomy  which  allowed  continuation  of  HU  at  a higher dose. Severe neutropenias leading to death have not been reported.

THROMBOCYTOPENIA. It occurred  less  frequently  and  has  led  to  temporary  discontinuation  of therapy in a few cases only. In all reports thrombocytopenia was dose dependent and reversible upon discontinuation of HU.

APLASTIC  ANEMIA.  This has been reported in some studies and was reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. However, although search for a concomitant parvoviral or other infection did not disclose such a cause, the causative relation of HU cannot be conclusively assured.

- Safety in special populations

## PREGNANCY

The  literature  contains  reports  of  several  women  who  conceived,  and  a  few  men  who  fathered children, after discontinuing a long treatment with HU; in none of these cases was any malformation or other fetal complication observed. This holds true also for the rare instances of SCD women who inadvertedly  became  pregnant  while  on  the  drug  and  continued  gestation  to  term;  here  again,  no congenital abnormalities or other complications were noticed. However, in this group, most pregnant women did not want to take the potential risks and elected termination of pregnancy.

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No safety studies related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions have been submitted

- Post marketing experience

None available.

- Overdose

Acute mucocutaneous toxicity has been reported in patients receiving hydroxycarbamide at dosages several  times  above  the  therapeutic  dose.  Soreness,  violet  erythema,  oedema  on  palms  and  soles followed by scaling of hand and feet, severe generalised hyperpigmentation of the skin and stomatitis have been observed.

In patients with Sickle Cell Syndrome, neutropenia was reported in isolated cases of hydroxycarbamide overdose (1.43 times and 8.57 times of the maximum recommended dose of 35 mg/kg b.w./day). It is recommended that blood counts are monitored for several weeks after overdose since recovery may be delayed.

Treatment of overdose consists of gastric lavage, followed by symptomatic treatment and control of bone marrow function.

## Discussion on clinical safety

Siklos is contraindicated in case of hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients, severe  hepatic  (Child-Pugh  classification  C)  or  severe  renal  impairment  (creatinine  clearance  &lt; 30ml/min), toxic ranges of myelosuppression (as described in the SPC under section 4.2). Siklos is contraindicated during lactation.

The myelosuppression, which is the main adverse event encountered in the clinical trials, is clearly linked to the dosage of HU. The incidence of myelosuppression could reach 80% of the patients in the studies that attempted to reach MTD (maximal tolerated dose), while myelosuppression occurred at a much lower incidence in the studies or patient registries in which HU dose was not increased until toxicity occurred.

Treatment with Siklos requires close clinical monitoring. The haematological status of the patient, as well  as  renal  and  hepatic  functions  should  be  determined  prior  to,  and  repeatedly  during  treatment. During treatment with Siklos, blood counts must be monitored every two weeks at treatment initiation (i.e.  for  the  first  two  months)  and  if  the  daily  dose  of  hydroxycarbamide  is  up  to  35  mg/  kg  b.w. Patients who are stable on lower doses should be monitored every 2 months.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment  with  Siklos  should  be  discontinued  if  bone  marrow  function  is  markedly  depressed. Neutropenia  is  generally  the  first  and  most  common  manifestation  of  haematological  suppression. Thrombocytopenia  and  anaemia  occur  less  frequently,  and  are  rarely  seen  without  a  preceding neutropenia. Recovery from myelosuppression is usually rapid when therapy is discontinued. Siklos therapy can then be re-initiated at a slightly lower dose (see section 4.2).

Siklos should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).

## Continuous follow-up of the growth of treated children is recommended.

It is difficult to obtain valid incidences of neoplasms in SCD patients, because of the small samples present in the studies. Hydroxycarbamide is unequivocally genotoxic in a wide range of test systems. Hydroxycarbamide  is  presumed  to  be  a  transspecies  carcinogen.  In  patients  receiving  long-term hydroxycarbamide for myeloproliferative disorders, secondary leukaemia has been reported. In a study with  patients  suffering  from  Polycythaemia  vera,  the  incidence  of  acute  leukaemia  after  a  median follow-up of 8.6 years was 5.9% in the HU group, as compared with 1.5% in the phlebotomy group. Somatic mutations were measured in 26 children who had been exposed to HU during 5 years. No child on HU acquired myelodysplasia, leukaemia, or any other malignancy. It is unknown whether this leukemogenic effect is secondary to hydroxycarbamide or is associated with the patient's underlying disease. Skin cancer has also been reported in patients receiving long-term hydroxycarbamide.

Reversible azo- and oligo-spermia have been rarely observed in man, although these disorders are also associated  with  the  underlying  disease  (see  4.8,  5.3).  Azoospermia  and  amenorrhoea  are  known complications  of  HU  therapy.  One  case  of  azoospermia  and  one  case  of  amenorrhoea  have  been reported in the paediatric clinical trials. The effects of HU on fertility have been emphasised in the SPC.  These  effects  are  considered  as  major  events.  The  Applicant  has  agreed  to  seek  protocol assistance in order to design an adequate protocol to investigate this issue.

As stroke is a major complication of SCD, it is difficult to ascertain a causal relationship between the occurrence of stroke and the use of HU. HU might even provide protection against stroke recurrence.

Hypersplenism and splenic sequestration are known complications of SCD. The incidence observed in clinical studies does not indicate a precipitation of these events by HU.

HU has a potential  to  precipitate  leg  ulcers  in  SCD  patients  with  a  history  of  ulcers.  No  definitive conclusion can be drawn about the influence of HU on this serious adverse event.

HU may prevent priapism attacks in SCD, probably at higher doses than usually prescribed for painful crisis prevention (25 to 35 mg/kg/day).

Some cases of ALT increase have been reported in the trials. However, no serious hepatic effects have been attributed to HU in patients with SCD.

In all studies to date, growth and development appear to be unaffected.

The  data  are  too  limited  to  justify  any  use  of  HU  in  pregnancy  and  lactation.  However,  no  major adverse effect occurred in the newborns whose mother received HU during pregnancy.

The  use  of  very  high  doses  of  HU  should  be  avoided.  The  risk  of  major  myelosuppression  is considerably increased when HU is titrated up to the 'maximum tolerated dose'. The dosage of 30 mg/kg/day should only exceptionally be exceeded, i.e. when a better clinical response is observed with 35 mg/kg/day.

Concerning the long-term use of HU, which can be the rule in patients with SCD, while no cases with major adverse outcomes have been published, the following points remain a matter of concern:

- the effects of HU on growth,
- the risk of carcinogenic effects, and
- the use during pregnancy and lactation.

These three points are considered as major issues in the pharmacovigilance risk management plan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Hydroxycarbamide causes  macrocytosis,  which  may  mask  the  incidental  development  of  folic  acid and vitamin B12 deficiency. Prophylactic administration of folic acid is recommended.

Patients and/or parents or the legal responsible person must be able to follow directions regarding the administration of this medicinal product, their monitoring and care.

Specific interaction studies have not been performed with hydroxycarbamide.

Potentially fatal pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, and severe peripheral neuropathy have been reported in  HIV-infected  patients  who  received  hydroxycarbamide  in  combination  with  antiretroviral  agents particularly  didanosine  plus  stavudine.  Patients  treated  with  hydroxycarbamide  in  combination  with didanosine,  stavudine,  and  indinavir  showed  a  median  decline  in  CD4  cells  of  approximately 100/mm 3 .

Concurrent  use  of  hydroxycarbamide  and  other  myelosuppressive  medicinal  products  or  radiation therapy  may  increase  bone  marrow  depression,  gastro-intestinal  disturbances  or  mucositis.  An erythema caused by radiation therapy may be aggravated by hydroxycarbamide.

Concomitant use of hydroxycarbamide with a live virus vaccine may potentiate the replication of the vaccine virus and/or may increase the adverse reaction of the vaccine virus, because normal defence mechanisms may be suppressed by hydroxycarbamide therapy. Vaccination with a live vaccine in a patient  taking  hydroxycarbamide  may  result  in  severe  infections.  Generally,  the  patient's  antibody response  to  vaccines  may  be  decreased.  Treatment  with  Siklos  and  concomitant  immunisation  with live virus vaccines should only be performed if benefits clearly outweigh potential risks.

Pregnancy :  Studies  in  animals  have  shown  reproductive  toxicity  (see  section  5.3).  Patients  on hydroxycarbamide should be made aware of the theoretical risks to the foetus and those wishing to conceive should stop treatment 3 to 6 months before pregnancy if possible. The evaluation of the riskbenefit ratio should be made on an individual basis outweighing the respective risk of hydroxycarbamide therapy against the switch to a blood transfusion programme.

Based on the limited amount of available information, in case of an exposure to hydroxycarbamide during  pregnancy,  a  careful  follow-up  with  adequate  clinical,  biological  and  ultrasonographic examinations should be considered.

Women of child-bearing  potential should  be  advised  to  use  adequate  birth-control  measures  during treatment with hydroxycarbamide. The use of effective contraception is strongly recommended. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking Siklos, she should be advised of the potential risk to the foetus.

Lactation : Hydroxycarbamide is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants, breast-feeding must be discontinued while taking Siklos.

No studies  on  the  effect  on  the  ability  to  drive  and  use  machines  have  been  performed.  However, patients  should  be  informed  that  dizziness  has  been  reported  from  literature,  but  not  commonly. Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machines, if dizziness is experienced while taking Siklos.

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative  requirements.  The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  must  ensure  that  the  system  of pharmacovigilance  is  in  place  and  functioning  before  the  product  is  placed  on  the  market.  The Marketing Authorisation Holder commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance plan.

## Risk Management Plan

The Applicant submitted a risk management plan to closely monitor the well-known toxicity of HU, not  only  the  acute  events  (myelosuppression),  but  also  the  long-term  effects,  i.e.  the  potential

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

carcinogenic  effects,  of  which  the  importance  and  frequency  remain  unknown  for  children  and adolescents treated with HU for SCD.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

In  particular,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  shall  ensure  that,  prior  to  launch,  all physicians  who  are  expected  to  prescribe  Siklos  are  provided  with  a  physician  information  pack containing treatment guides for physicians and patients, containing agreed elements. For physicians, this  includes  the  SPC,  the  need  for  periodic  blood  counts  and  dose  adjustment,  the  need  for contraception,  the  risk  to  male  and  female  fertility,  potential  risk  to  foetus  and  breast  feeding,  the growth follow-up of treated children, the handling of broken tablets and the management of adverse drug  reactions.  The  patient  information  pack  should  contain  a  number  of  key  elements,  including handling  of  broken  tablets,  need  for  periodic  blood  counts,  information  on  crisis  or  infections,  the patient information leaflet, the need for contraception, the risk to male and female fertility, potential risk to foetus and breast feeding, key signs and symptoms of serious adverse reactions, when to seek urgent attention from the health care provider and information on growth follow-up of treated children for their parents. The MAH must implement this educational plan nationally, prior to marketing, and as agreed with the competent authorities in the Member States. An updated Risk Management Plan should be provided as per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products of human use.

## Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

In the preclinical toxicity studies reviewed from the literature the most common effects noted included bone marrow depression, lymphoid atrophy and deg e nerative changes in the epithelium of the small and  large  intestines.  Cardiovascular  effects  and  haematological  changes  were  observed  in  some species.  Also,  in  rats  testicular  atrophy  with  decreased  spermatogenesis  occurred,  while  in  dogs reversible spermatogenic arrest was noted.

## Hydroxycarbamide is unequivocally genotoxic in a wide range of test systems.

Conventional long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of hydroxycarbamide have not been performed. However, hydroxycarbamide is presumed to be a transspecies carcinogen.

Hydroxycarbamide crosses the placenta barrier and has been demonstrated to be a potent teratogen and embryotoxic  in  a wide  variety of animal  models  at or below  the  human  therapeutic  dose. Teratogenicity was  characterised by  partially ossified cranial bones, absence  of eye sockets, hydrocephaly,  bipartite  sternebrae,  missing  lumbar  vertebrae.  Embryotoxicity  was  characterized  by decreased foetal viability, reduced live litter sizes, and developmental delays. In the human, according to a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 123 adult patients treated with hydroxycarbamide, twentythree pregnancies have been reported from 15 women treated with hydroxycarbamide and partners of 3 men treated with hydroxycarbamide. Most (61 %) had a normal outcome with regard to term and normal  birth.  In  the  other  cases  with  known  evolution,  pregnancy  had  been  interrupted  either voluntarily  or  upon  medical  advice.  Thus  the  data  on  a  limited  number  of  exposed  pregnancies indicate no adverse effects on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn. Due to the potential teratogenic  effects  in  animal  models,  although  no  malformations  have  been  reported  in  humans  to date, the use of HU during pregnancy remains not recommended, although not contra-indicated.

Hydroxycarbamide administered to male rats at 60 mg/kg b.w./day (about double the recommended usual  maximum  dose  in  humans)  produced  testicular  atrophy,  decreased  spermatogenesis  and significantly reduced their ability to impregnate females.

Siklos is a medicinal product that must be handled with care. People who are not taking Siklos and in particular pregnant women should avoid being in contact with hydroxycarbamide.

In case the prescribed dosage requires breaking the tablet in halves or quarters, this should be done out of the reach of food. Powder eventually spilled from the broken tablet should be wiped up with a damp disposable towel, which is discarded. Unused broken tablets must be replaced in blister and put back in the box. Anyone handling Siklos should wash ones hands before and after contact with the tablets.

Any  unused  product  or  waste  material  should  be  disposed  of  in  the  accordance  with  local requirements.

## Efficacy

In  nearly  all  clinical  studies  reviewed  from  the  literature  conducted  in  patients  with  Sickle  Cell Syndrome, hydroxycarbamide strongly reduced the frequency of vaso-occlusive episodes by 66% to 80%, in children and in adults. The same response was observed for the number of hospital admissions and  the  number  of  days  of  hospitalisation  for  patients  treated  with  hydroxycarbamide.  The  yearly frequency of acute chest syndrome was also reduced by 25 to 33% under hydroxycarbamide in several studies. Acute chest syndrome is a frequent life-threatening complication of Sickle Cell Syndrome and is characterized by chest pain or fever or dyspnoea with recent infiltrate on chest X-ray.

A sustained clinical benefit was demonstrated in patients remaining on hydroxycarbamide treatment for up to 8 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  specific  mechanism  of  action  of  hydroxycarbamide  is  not  fully  understood.  One  of  the mechanisms  by  which  hydroxycarbamide  acts  is  the  elevation of  foetal  haemoglobin  (HbF) concentrations in sickle cell patients. HbF interferes with the polymerisation of HbS and thus impedes the  sickling  of  red  blood  cell.  In  all  clinical  studies,  there  was  a  significant  increase  in  HbF  from baseline after hydroxycarbamide use. This increase was highly significant at 6 months and the mean percentage  HbF  values  was  sustained  at  approximately  20%  even  after  7  years  of  continuous hydroxycarbamide therapy. The threshold of HbF for obtaining clinical efficacy could be comprised between  15  and  20%.  The  response  on  HbF  levels  could  be  improved  by  an  increase  the hydroxycarbamide dosage, from 20 mg/kg/day up to 35 mg/kg/day.

In  addition  hydroxycarbamide  causes  an  immediate  inhibition  of  DNA  synthesis  by  acting  as  a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, without interfering with the synthesis of ribonucleic acid or protein.

Beside  the  inconstant  correlation  between  reduction  of  crisis  rate  and  the  increase  in  HbF,  the cytoreductive effect of hydroxycarbamide, particularly the drop of neutrophils, was the factor with the strongest correlation to a reduced crisis rate.

## Safety

The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  reaction  is  myelosuppression  with  neutropenia  as  the  most common manifestation. Bone marrow depression is the dose-limiting toxic effect of hydroxycarbamide. When the maximum tolerated dose is not reached transient myelotoxicity usually occurs  in  less  than  10%  of  patients,  while  under  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  more  than  50%  can experience  reversible  bone  marrow  suppression.  These  adverse  reactions  are  expected  based  on  the pharmacology of hydroxycarbamide. Gradual dose titration may help to diminish these effects (see section 4.2). From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials  have been included in the Summary  of Product Characteristics. Siklos is contraindicated in case of hypersensitivity  to  the  active  substance  or  to  any  of  the  excipients,  severe  hepatic  (Child-Pugh classification  C)  or  severe  renal  impairment  (creatinine  clearance  &lt;  30ml/min),  toxic  ranges  of myelosuppression  (as  described  in  the  SPC  under  section  4.2).  Siklos  is  contraindicated  during lactation.

The effect of the long-term use on male fertility and even more important the possible effect of this long term use in childhood on the development of sperm with a theoretical risk of inducing congenital physical defects, is not known. The Applicant has committed to investigate this issue and a protocol to study  this  has  been  presented  in  the  Risk  Management  Plan.  The  applicant  has  considered  the feasibilities  to  recruit  a  control  group  for  the  sperm  study.  The  applicant  agreed  to  seek  scientific advice  in  order  to  find  a  better  protocol  that  will  lead  to  a  data  collection  that  will  resolve  this important issue.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

- -User consultation

The Applicant submitted a readability testing report in accordance with the directive 2001/83/EC. The readability  of  the  package  leaflet  has  been  assessed  to  ensure  that  potential  users  can  locate, understand and appropriate act upon the information provided in the leaflet.

## Risk-benefit assessment

Statistically and clinically significant reductions in pain episodes for the HU arm compared to placebo have been demonstrated. Other important benefits were a reduction in the frequency of hospitalisations and in total yearly days of hospitalisations. These improvements were not hampered by major toxic events. Acute toxic events (myelosuppression) could be minimized by the use of median doses (not exceeding 30 mg/kg/day). Long-term effects, including secondary malignancies, did not occur in the first 10 years of follow-up.

No  other  pharmacological  approach  can  be  considered  as  a  valuable  alternative  for  HU.  Repeated phlebotomy can reduce the frequency of painful episodes in selected patients with high steady state Hb levels. In pregnancy, prophylactic transfusion showed a decrease in painful episodes.

For  patients  with  a  history  of  severe  or  recurrent  episodes  of  acute  chest  syndrome,  HU  therapy  is recommended. Transfusion therapy is recommended if there is a clinical deterioration, multilobular infiltrates, or a history of underlying pulmonary or cardiac disease.

HU  therapy  can  be  considered  to  prevent  recurrent  events  of  stroke,  although  it  has  not  been extensively studied.

The  applicant  committed  to  develop  an  additional  pharmaceutical  form,  which  is  more  adapted  to children. Preliminary discussions with clinical experts have identified the 100 mg tablet form as the most appropriate dosage for these patients. The new dosage will be submitted within a maximum of two years after the granting of the marketing authorisation for Siklos 1000 mg tablets.

The  potential  risk  of  HU  on  long-term  and  short  term  is  not  negligible  as  HU  is  mitogenic  and carcinogenic. An adequate risk management plan has been submitted.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted,  was  of  the  opinion  that  pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns. Additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information. The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall ensure that, prior to launch, all  physicians  who  are  expected  to  prescribe  Siklos  are  provided  with  physician  information  pack containing treatment guides for physicians and patients, containing agreed key elements. Furthermore, the Marketing Authorisation Holder must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market.  The Marketing Authorisation Holder commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance plan. An updated Risk Management Plan should be provided as per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products of human use.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Siklos  in  the  approved  indication  i.e.  'prevention  of recurrent painful vaso-occlusive crises including acute chest syndrome in paediatric and adult patients suffering  from  symptomatic  Sickle  Cell  Syndrome.  (see  section  5.1)'  was  favourable  and  therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
