## 1. Introduction

On 11 June 2025, the MAH submitted the final Clinical Study Report for a completed paediatric study E7080-G000-231 for Kisplyx (and Lenvima), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. Study 231 is part of the clinical development program for Lenvatinib in the approved Paediatric Investigation Plan (EMEA-001119-PIP03-19-M03). This study was completed on 13 February 2025, which was the final database lock for the study.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that selectively inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4), in addition to other proangiogenic and oncogenic pathway-related RTKs including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4, the platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor PDGFRα, KIT, and RET.

The first approval for lenvatinib was granted on 28 May 2015 in the EU for treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, RAI-refractory DTC. Subsequently, lenvatinib has been approved for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), Endometrial Carcinoma (EC) and the advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), either as Lenvima or Kisplyx.

The MAH stated that Study E7080-G000-231/MK-7902-013 (hereafter referred to as HOPSKIP-013), falls within the scope of the Paediatric Regulation; it is identified as Study 2 in the lenvatinib PIP (EMEA-001119-PIP03-19-M03). Study 231 is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter basket study to evaluate the antitumor activity and safety of Lenvatinib in children, adolescents, and young adults with relapsed or refractory solid malignancies. The study was conducted to evaluate the antitumor activity and safety of lenvatinib in 4 cohorts: HGG, RMS, EWS/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour (pPNET; hereafter referred to as EWS), and any other solid tumours (aside from osteosarcoma). The primary efficacy analysis results for Study 231 were provided in the previously submitted CSR (DCO date: 16-SEP-2022; [Ref. 5.3.5.4: P013V01MK7902]) as part of procedure EMEA/H/C/WS2631. This study was completed on 13 February 2025, which was the final database lock for the study

Within the clinical development scope of Lenvima /Kisplyx in paediatric setting, Study 231 is one of the main clinical studies in PIP EMEA001119-PIP03-19-M03 (condition: solid tumours) approved on December 2023. This Type II variation was submitted for both Lenvima and Kisplyx licenses to include the final results of the paediatric Study 231.

As the MAH is not planning to seek a paediatric indication based on the results of EMEA-001119-PIP0319-M03 submitted final CRS of Study 231, no changes to the SmPC are proposed in this procedure.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Lenvatinib was administered in the E7080-G000-231/MK-7902-013 as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)  capsules,  which  may  be  suspended  in  water  or  apple  juice  for  children  unable  to  swallow capsules.

One  of  the  secondary  objectives  of  the  Study  E7080-G000-231/MK-7902-013  was  to  assess  the palatability  and  acceptability  of  the  suspension  formulation  of  lenvatinib.  The  results  based  on  the palatability questionnaire using a facial hedonic scale were provided in the previous CSR dated 13-JUN2023 (P013V01MK7902).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for Study E7080-G000-231/MK-7902-013, presenting final disposition, demographics, exposure, and selected safety results collected through LPLV. A final analysis of updated OS data based on all data collected through the end of the study is included in this CSR (DCO date: 13-FEB-2025). No extension of the indication is applied for, and no modifications are proposed to the SmPC by the MAH.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Study E7080-G000-231/MK-7902-013 (hereafter referred to as HOPSKIP-013)

Title: A multicenter, open-label, Phase 2 basket study to evaluate the antitumor activity and safety of lenvatinib in children, adolescents, and young adults between 2 and ≤21 years of age with relapsed or refractory solid malignancies.

## Methods - analysis of data submitted

Figure 1 Study 231 design

<!-- image -->

EWS = Ewing Sarcoma, HGG = high-grade glioma (including anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, glioblastoma, mixed glioma, and malignant glioma), pPNET = peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor, RMS = rhabdomyosarcoma.

## Study participants

Key inclusion criteria were:

- -Male/female children, adolescents, and young adult subjects with relapsed or refractory pediatric solid tumors (excluding osteosarcoma) between the ages of 2 and 21 years, inclusive, were to be enrolled in this study.
- -Had histologically or cytologically documented relapsed or refractory pediatric solid malignancy excluding osteosarcoma. Subjects with diffuse midline glioma (formerly known as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma), optic pathway glioma, or pineal tumors with elevated tumor markers (AFP, β -hCG, or hCG) did not require histological or cytological confirmation of diagnosis. Subjects with diffuse midline glioma were not eligible for the HGG cohort and should only be enrolled in the other solid tumors' cohort.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Had measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1 or RANO for HGG, as defined in the study protocol.
- -Had a KPS (for subjects &gt;16 years of age) or Lansky play score (for subjects ≤16 years of age) ≥50.
- -Neurologic deficits in subjects with primary CNS tumors must have been stable for at least 7 days prior to study enrollment.  Subjects who were unable to walk because of paralysis, but who could perform ADL while wheelchair bound, were considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score.

## Key exclusion criteria were:

- -Had a major surgery within 3 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Note:  Adequate wound healing after major surgery must be assessed clinically, independent of time elapsed for eligibility.
- -Had CNS tumors with a history of symptomatic tumor hemorrhage.
- -Had radiographic evidence of encasement or invasion of a major blood vessel or of intratumoral cavitation.
- Note:  The degree of proximity to major blood vessels should be considered for exclusion because of the potential risk of severe hemorrhage associated with tumor shrinkage/necrosis after lenvatinib therapy.
- -Had evidence of untreated CNS metastases (exception:  subjects with primary CNS tumors and leptomeningeal disease).
- -History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

## Treatments

Subjects were administered lenvatinib 14 mg/m2 orally QD and could continue to receive lenvatinib until a treatment discontinuation criterion was met, as described in the study protocol. Planned enrollment was to be a minimum of 36 subjects (9 subjects in each of 4 cohorts:  HGG, RMS, EWS, and other solid tumors) and an estimated maximum of approximately 150 subjects.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Not applicable, the study is open-label.

## Statistical Methods

The primary efficacy population was the EAS, which included all evaluable participants, who had measurable disease present at baseline and at least 1 post baseline efficacy assessment, unless they discontinued prior to the first efficacy assessment due to progressive disease.

Objective responses counted only confirmed (≥4 weeks after initial response) complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) at Week 16. Estimated objective response rate (ORR) and its exact 95% confidence interval (CI) using the method of Clopper and Pearson were presented. The ORR, disease control rate (DCR), and clinical benefit rate (CBR) were provided with exact 95% CIs using the method of Clopper and Pearson, and the duration of response (DOR) was analyzed for responders using Kaplan-Meier approach.

PFS was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimates. The cumulative progression-free survival (PFS) probabilities were plotted over time as appropriate.

The primary safety population was the Safety Analysis Set, which included all participants who received at least 1 dose of the study drug. Count and percentage of adverse events (AE) by system organ class and preferred term are provided.

## Results

The DCO date of EoT is 13-FEB-2025.

Efficacy results (ORR, BOR, DCR, DOR, PFS, palatability, and OS) from the primary analysis were provided in the previous CSR dated 13-JUN-2023 (P013V01MK7902) and are briefly summarized in this report for completeness. OS was formally analysed and presented in the previous CSR; however, due to additional follow-up, a final analysis of OS was performed and is included in this CSR (DCO date: 13-FEB-2025).

A total of 4 cohorts were evaluated: HGG, RMS, EWS/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET; hereafter referred to as EWS), and any other solid tumors (aside from osteosarcoma).

## Participant Disposition:

- As of the data cutoff date, 127 allocated (9 in EWS, 17 in RMS, 8 in HGG, 9 each in diffuse midline glioma, medulloblastoma, and ependymoma, and 66 in other solid tumors cohort), 127 treated, 127 discontinued treatment, 0 ongoing on treatment, 0 completed study, 127 discontinued study, 0 ongoing in the study.

## Extent of Exposure:

The median duration of exposure to study treatment was 104.0 days (range: 8.0 to 627.0). A total of 32 participants had a median duration of exposure based on personmonths of ≥6 months. The median dose intensity was 13.8 mg/m2/day (range: 6.3 to 14.0 mg/m2/day)

## Efficacy results

## Primary efficacy endpoint:

- -Although objective responses occurred in some participants, antitumor activity could not be concluded for any cohort in this study based on investigator assessment of ORR at Week 16 per RECIST 1.1 or RANO (for HGG only).
- -The ORR at Week 16 per RECIST 1.1 or RANO (for HGG only) was 22.2% in the EWS, 11.8% in the RMS, and 7.7% in the other solid tumors cohorts. No antitumor activity was observed in participants with HGG, diffuse midline glioma, medulloblastoma, and ependymoma.

## Secondary efficacy endpoints:

- -The ORR per investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1 or RANO (for HGG only) was 22.2% in the EWS, 11.8% in the RMS, and 7.7% in the other solid tumors cohorts as of the DCO date.

- No objective responses were observed in participants with HGG, diffuse midline glioma, medulloblastoma, and ependymoma.
- -The DCR was 66.7% in the EWS, 52.9% in the RMS, 33.3% in the HGG, 22.2% in the diffuse midline glioma, 55.6% in the medulloblastoma, 55.6% in the ependymoma, and 64.6% in the other solid tumors cohorts. The CBR was 33.3%, 29.4%, 11.1%, 44.4%, 33.3%, and 40.0% in the EWS, RMS, diffuse midline glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and the other solid tumors cohorts, respectively.
- -The median DOR was not reached in the EWS cohort; the median DOR was 4.6 months each in RMS and other solid tumors cohorts. The median TTR was 2.8, 1.8, and 1.9 months in the EWS, RMS, and other solid tumors cohorts, respectively.
- -The median PFS was 3.0, 2.6, 1.9, 1.8, 3.4, 2.5, and 3.8 months in the EWS, RMS, HGG, diffuse midline glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and other solid tumors cohorts, respectively.
- -The median OS was 9.4, 4.9, 3.8, 3.8, 6.3, 7.4, and 10.4 months in the EWS, RMS, HGG, diffuse midline glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and the other solid tumors cohorts, respectively.

## Final Analysis of OS

- -With a median follow-up duration of 7.9 months (range 0.9 to 50.4), the median OS (months) was 9.4 (95% CI: 1.0, 17.7) in EWS, 4.9 (95% CI: 2.8, 9.4) in RMS, 3.8 (95% CI: 1.6, NR) in HGG, 3.8 (95% CI: 0.9, 9.6) in diffuse midline glioma, 6.3 (95% CI: 2.3, 38.8) in medulloblastoma, 7.4 (95% CI: 2.3, 13.6) in ependymoma, and 11.1 (95% CI: 7.7, 15.1) in other solid tumors cohorts.

## Pneumothorax

Pneumothorax is a known risk for lenvatinib in different tumour types. The total incidence of pneumothorax at DCO (13-FEB-2025) in Study 231 was 6.3% (n=8). Since the previous CSR, one more patient with pneumothorax was reported as previously pneumothorax occurred in 7 patients (5.5%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All 8 cases were diagnosed as SAEs. For 4 subjects (3.1%), the pneumothorax was considered as treatment-related by the investigator. For 7 patients grade 3-5 pneumothorax was reported (6 patients previously). Six subjects (4.7%) had study treatment interrupted for the event; 1 subject discontinued treatment for pneumothorax.

## Clinical Laboratory Evaluations

No updated results on clinical laboratory evaluations are submitted since previous CSR (DCO date: 16SEP-2022).

## Vital Signs, Physical Examination Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety

The updated results since previous CSR (DCO date: 16-SEP-2022) have not been submitted. However, according to the submitted tables in the final CSR (P013MK7902), no more hypertension cases were apparently reported as a CSAE during this additional follow-up period.

## Post marketing Data

Lenvatinib is not approved for any indication in the paediatric population.  For post marketing data for lenvatinib, refer to the most recent periodic safety update report (lenvatinib PSUR).

## 2.4. Discussion on clinical aspects

The target tumour types in Study 231 were RMS, EWS, and HGG; in addition, Study 231 permitted the enrolment of patients with any solid tumour type with the exception of osteosarcoma.  In line with the approved PIP, this study population included patients aged 2 to 21 years.

The primary endpoint results (ORR at W16 based on investigator assessment) were consistent with the previous report: there were no objective responses observed in patients with HGG, diffuse midline glioma, medulloblastoma, or ependymoma. Two PRs were observed in both the EWS and RMS cohorts for an ORR at Week 16 of 22.2% and 11.8%, respectively. Five PRs were observed among all other solid tumours for an ORR at Week 16 of 7.7%.

The final OS results have been provided by the MAH. The median follow-up duration was 7.9 months. The median OS (months) was 9.4 in EWS, 4.9 in RMS, 3.8 in HGG, 3.8 in diffuse midline glioma, 6.3 in medulloblastoma, 7.4 in ependymoma, and 11.1 in other solid tumours cohorts.

Overall, the final efficacy OS results of Study 231 were consistent to the primary analysis previously reported. The interpretation of OS results is hampered by the study design (single arm trial).

Lenvatinib appears to have, based on limited data, an acceptable safety profile in cancer patients aged 2 to 21 years when treatment is administered at 14 mg/m2 QD (based on BSA, maximum 24 mg/day) and adjusted by a dose-titration algorithm to manage toxicity.

A total of 127 subjects were enrolled and treated with lenvatinib in Study 231.

Since the previous CSR (DCO 16-Sep-2022), no new fatal AEs were reported. No new safety concerns were identified.

However, no  updated  results  on  clinical  laboratory  evaluations  as  well  as  vital  signs  and  physical examination findings were submitted since previous CSR (DCO date: 16-SEP-2022), so the MAH is asked to provide the above information and include any relevant new data in the final CSR (P013MK7902).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Most participants discontinued treatment with lenvatinib. The primary reason for treatment discontinuation was PD (n=85 [66.9%]).  As of final CSR DCO (13-Feb-2025), all participants completed study, there were no patients still receiving study treatment.

The adverse events reported in the final CSR are consistent with the known safety profile of single-agent lenvatinib  in  adult  cancer  populations  and  paediatric  patients  (Study  E7080-G000-207),  and  those reported at the previous CSR (DCO 16-Sep-2022). No new safety signals were identified.

However the incidence of pneumothorax of 6.3% is higher than that observed previously with singleagent lenvatinib in adults (DTC lenvatinib monotherapy, 1.1%; non-DTC lenvatinib monotherapy, 0.5%).

Pneumothorax  occurred  in  8  subjects  (6.3%).  Since  the  previous  CSR,  one  more  patient  with pneumothorax was reported as previously pneumothorax occurred in 7 patients (5.5%).

As at least one additional case of pneumothorax was reported in paediatric patients, the MAH is asked to  provide  description/narrative  of  this  case  and  to  suggest  an  update  of  the  SmPC  section  4.8 ('Paediatric population' part), to be subsequently implemented in the scope of a work-sharing procedure for Lenvima and Kisplyx.

Overall, a total of 66 (52.0%) subjects experienced at least 1 SAE during the study.  The most frequently reported SAEs (incidence ≥2%) were pneumothorax (6.3%); abdominal pain(3.9%); pyrexia, urinary tract  infection,  headache  (3.1%  each);  and  pneumonia  aspiration  ,  sepsis,  intracranial  pressure increased, and hypertension (2.4% each). Of 28 (22.0%) subjects experienced SAEs that were assessed as related to study drug by the investigator.  The most frequently reported treatment-related SAEs were pneumothorax and hypertension. Serious AEs appeared to be partly due to lenvatinib.

As required per protocol, the management of lenvatinib toxicities (Grade 3 or 4 and intolerable Grade 2) required an interruption until resolution of event, followed by restarting treatment at a lower dose of lenvatinib (dose reduction) once the toxicity returned to baseline level or improved to Grade 0 or 1. 36 subjects (21.8%) interrupted had an interruption of study treatment for a drug-related AE.  The most commonly reported AEs leading to study treatment interruption were pneumothorax and proteinuria. A total  of  48  subjects  (37.8%)  and  76  subjects  (59.8%)  experienced  dose  reduction  and  treatment modification  due  to  a  drug-related  AE,  respectively.  The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  resulting  in lenvatinib dose reduction were proteinuria and hypertension.

In the Study 231, the most frequently reported (≥15%) adverse drug reactions were hypothyroidism, hypertension, decreased appetite, proteinuria, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight decreased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, alanine aminotransferase increased, constipation, platelet count decreased, fatigue, headache, nausea and anaemia. The MAH is asked to suggest an update of the SmPC section 4.8 ('Paediatric population' part) accordingly, to be subsequently implemented in the scope of a work-sharing procedure for Lenvima and Kisplyx.

The safety profile of lenvatinib in the final analysis is consistent with the known safety profile of lenvatinib and consistent with the previously reported safety profile from this study. No new safety concerns were identified.

## Conclusions

This procedure presents the final analysis on efficacy (final OS analysis) and safety data of lenvatinib monotherapy from one paediatric clinical trial (Study 231). The safety profile observed for lenvatinib as single-agent (Study 231) was overall consistent with the known safety profile of the individual agents. No new safety signals  were  detected.  TEAEs  were  manageable  using  standard  clinical  management together with protocol-defined dose modifications.

## 2.4.1. Changes to the Product Information

No changes to the SmPC are suggested by the MAH. Please refer to discussion above and RSI.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Fulfilled.

No regulatory action required.

## 4. Request for supplementary information

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure:

- 1) No updated results on clinical laboratory evaluations as well as vital signs and physical examination findings were submitted since previous CSR (DCO date: 16-SEP-2022), so the MAH is asked to provide the above information and include any relevant new data in the final CSR (P013MK7902).
- 2) As at least one additional case of pneumothorax was reported in paediatric patients, the MAH is asked to provide description/narrative of this case and to suggest an update of the SmPC section 4.8 ('Paediatric population' subsection), to be subsequently implemented in the scope of a work-sharing procedure for Lenvima and Kisplyx.
- 3) In the Study 231, the most frequently reported (≥15%) adverse drug reactions were hypothyroidism, hypertension, decreased appetite, proteinuria, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight decreased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, alanine aminotransferase increased, constipation, platelet count decreased, fatigue, headache, nausea and anaemia. The MAH is asked to suggest an update of the SmPC section 4.8 ('Paediatric population' subsection) accordingly, to be subsequently implemented in the scope of a work-sharing procedure for Lenvima and Kisplyx.

The timetable is a 30-day response timetable with clock stop.

## 5. Assessment of the MAH responses to the RSI

- 1) No updated results on clinical laboratory evaluations as well as vital signs and physical examination findings were submitted since previous CSR (DCO date: 16-SEP-2022), so the MAH is asked to provide the above information and include any relevant new data in the final CSR (P013MK7902).

## Summary of the MAH's response

The final clinical study report (CSR) with the primary efficacy analysis results for Study 231 was submitted as part of procedure EMEA/H/C/WS2631 (data cutoff [DCO] date: 16-SEP-2022). The 'End of Trial' DCO occurred on 13-Feb-2025 and a synoptic CSR (sCSR) was prepared to fulfill Article 46 of the EU Paediatric Regulation (EC No 1901/2006). The sCSR presents final disposition, demographics, exposure, and selected safety results collected through to the last participant's last visit. A final analysis of updated overall survival (OS) data based on all data collected through the end of the study was also included.

Given that clinically meaningful abnormalities in laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and physical examinations are reported as adverse events (AEs) (see sCSR Section 12.4 and Table 2-14 to Table 2-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 35), and a review of all safety data at the end of trial concluded that safety results remain consistent with those reported at the primary analysis (DCO date: 16-SEP-2022), tables with updated results on clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and physical examination findings were not included in the sCSR. Of note, this approach is consistent with that taken for paediatric Study E7080-G000-230 - A Multicenter, Open-label, Randomized Phase 2 Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Lenvatinib in Combination with Ifosfamide and Etoposide versus Ifosfamide and Etoposide in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults with Relapsed or Refractory Osteosarcoma (OLIE) Lenvatinib (submitted on 11 FEB 2024 under procedure numbers EMA/H/C/003727/P46/023 and EMA/H/C/004224/P46/020).

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The applicant mentioned only a synoptic CSR (sCSR) in this procedure was submitted (DCO date: 13FEB-2025). For the safety part, the updated adverse events (AEs) were summarised in the tables instead of listing the updated clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and physical examination findings. The same approach was also used in procedure EMA/H/C/003727/P46/023 and EMA/H/C/004224/P46/020 for paediatric Study E7080-G000-230 (submitted on 11 FEB 2024)

## Conclusion

## Issue Not Pursued

- 2) As at least one additional case of pneumothorax was reported in paediatric patients, the MAH is asked to provide description/narrative of this case and to suggest an update of the SmPC section 4.8 ('Paediatric population' subsection), to be subsequently implemented in the scope of a work-sharing procedure for Lenvima and Kisplyx.

## Summary of the MAH's response

As requested by the Agency, a description of the additional case of pneumothorax is provided below. Accordingly, Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to include this additional case of pneumothorax.

Subject, was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma 4 months and 13 days prior to the first dose of study medication. At Screening, the participant's Lansky Play Score was 70 and tumour assessments showed lung metastases. The participant was enrolled with refractory disease following first-line therapy (ifosfamide and doxorubicin [administered Day -88 to Day -36]) and had no prior history of radiation or anticancer procedures to the chest.

On Study Day 1, study medication with lenvatinib 14 mg/m2 per day was initiated. On Day 426, the participant attended a routine chest CT scan and tension pneumothorax (Grade 4) was identified. The participant was asymptomatic, did not have thorax trauma before, and was admitted to the hospital. A chest drain was placed. Lenvatinib was interrupted in response to AEs of increased Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) (Grade 1), increased pancreatic enzymes (Grade 1), and hyponatremia (Grade 1). On Day 426, lenvatinib was discontinued due to pneumothorax, with the last dose on Day 425 (Cycle 15). The participant entered the study Follow-up period.

On Day 429, a chest x-ray showed normal results, the lungs appeared clear with no more fluid and the chest drain was removed. The adverse event (AE) of pneumothorax was considered resolved. On Day 433, the participant was discharged with the diagnosis of tension pneumothorax drainage. On Day 454, the participant was considered to be in good condition and there was no pneumothorax recurrence. Events of increased AST, pancreatic enzymes, and hyponatremia were also considered resolved.

On Day 1016, the participant died; the primary reported cause of death was malignant neoplasm progression.

The investigator considered pneumothorax related to study medication. Baseline disease characteristics of clinical relevance for this patient included lung metastases.

## Conclusion

## Issue Resolved

- 3) In the Study 231, the most frequently reported (≥15%) adverse drug reactions were hypothyroidism, hypertension, decreased appetite, proteinuria, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight decreased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, alanine aminotransferase increased, constipation, platelet count decreased, fatigue, headache, nausea and anaemia. The MAH is asked to suggest an update of the SmPC section 4.8 ('Paediatric population' subsection) accordingly, to be subsequently implemented in the scope of a work-sharing procedure for Lenvima and Kisplyx.

## Summary of the MAH's response

To ensure consistency in the presentation of safety data in SmPC section 4.8, the summary for Study E7080-G000-231 includes the most common treatment-related AEs i.e., adverse drug reactions, in alignment with the data previously presented and agreed for Study E7080-A001-216 in the SmPC under procedure numbers EMEA/H/C/003727/P46/022 and EMEA/H/C/004224/P46/019. This approach has been adopted to support consistent interpretation of safety data across studies. Given that there are no changes to the list of m ost common adverse drug reactions (≥15%) at the time of the sCSR (see Table 2-17), no changes are proposed to SmPC section 4.8.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The applicant clarified the updated data of the most common adverse drug reactions (≥15%) in Study 231 was presented in Table 2-17 of the sCSR, including hypothyroidism, hypertension, proteinuria, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, and platelet count decreased (see below). As there are no updates to this list, the corresponding context in SmPC section 4.8 ('Paediatric population' part') can remain unchanged.
