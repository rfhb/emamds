## I. INTRODUCTION

On  December  22,  2009,  the  MAH  submitted  completed  paediatric  studies  for  Prevenar  13,  in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric studies do not influence the benefit risk for Prevenar 13 and that there is no consequential regulatory action.

## II. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study(ies)

13vPnC contains saccharides from pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F individually conjugated to nontoxic diphtheria toxin cross-reactive material 197 (CRM197). The vaccine is formulated to contain 2.2 μg of each saccharide, except for 4.4 μg of 6B per 0.5-mL dose. The final formulation contains 5 mM succinate buffer, 0.02% polysorbate 80, with 0.125 mg of aluminum as aluminum phosphate per 0.5-mL dose.

## Clinical aspects

## 1. Introduction

Wyeth  has  developed  Prevenar  13,  a  13-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  (13vPnC),  as  a successor  to  the  currently  registered  vaccine,  Prevenar,  for  use  in  infants  and  young  children  to prevent pneumococcal disease (invasive pneumococcal disease [IPD], nonbacteremic pneumonia, and acute  otitis  media  [AOM])  caused  by  the  13  pneumococcal  serotypes  contained  in  the  vaccine. Prevenar is a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPnC) that contains serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F. In addition to these serotypes, 13vPnC contains serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A.

The MAH submitted final reports for:

Study 6096A1-006: Final 6-Month Follow-up Addendum to Final Toddler Report: (Pivotal EU study) A  Phase  3,  Randomized,  Active-Controlled,  Double-Blind  Trial of the Safety, Tolerability,  and Immunologic Non-inferiority of a 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Compared to a 7-valent Pneumococcal  Conjugate  Vaccine  in  Healthy  Infants  Given  in  a  2-,  3-,  4-,  and  11-  to  12-Month Schedule With Routine Pediatric Vaccinations.

Study 6096A1-500 : Final 6-Month Follow-up Addendum to Final Infant and Toddler Report:

A Phase 3, Randomized, Active-Controlled, Double-blind Trial Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Infants Given With Routine Pediatric Vaccinations in Italy.

Study 6096A1-501: Final 6-Month Follow-up Addendum to Final Infant and Toddler Report:

A Phase 3, Randomized, Active-Controlled, Double-blind Trial Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Infants Given With Routine Pediatric Vaccinations in Spain.

Study 6096A1-3005: Final Toddler Report: A Phase 3, Randomized, Active-Controlled, Double-Blind Trial  Evaluating  The  Safety,  Tolerability,  and  Immunogenicity  of  3  lots  of  13-  Valent  Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine In Healthy Infants given with Routine Pediatric Vaccinations in The United States.

For  one  study  (6096A1-3005) immunogenicity and safety data from the toddler dose are presented and it should be noted that the infant series data were already submitted as part of the MAA. This CSR also includes the additional non-inferiority comparison of the anti-polysaccharide IgG responses after the infant series that were submitted in response to questions during review of the MAA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety data collected after the infant series, ie, the period from after the dose 3 blood draw to the toddler dose vaccination is also included. A review of these additional data is also presented in this Module 2.5 addendum. For the other 3 studies (6096A1-006, 6096A1-500, and 6096A1-501) safety data from the 6-month follow-up period are presented, and once again it should be noted that both the infant series and toddler dose were submitted with the MAA.

## 2. Clinical studies

Study 6096A1-006: Final 6-Month Follow-up Addendum to Final Toddler Report (Pivotal EU study):

A  Phase  3,  Randomized,  Active-Controlled,  Double-Blind  Trial of the Safety, Tolerability,  and Immunologic Non-inferiority of a 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Compared to a 7-valent Pneumococcal  Conjugate  Vaccine  in  Healthy  Infants  Given  in  a  2-,  3-,  4-,  and  11-  to  12-Month Schedule With Routine Pediatric Vaccinations.

## Description

Only a brief description of the study will be included as it has already been assessed during the original MAA procedure.

##  Methods

-  Objective(s)

Demonstrate that the PnC serotype-specific IgG responses induced by 13vPnC are non-inferior to those induced by 7vPnC or 7vPnC reference measured 1 month after the infant series.

Assess the non-inferiority of antigen-specific response (Dip, HBV, Hib) 1 month after dose 3 of PnC and concomitant vaccine in the 13vPnC group relative to the 7vPnC group

-  Study design

This  was  a  phase  3,  parallel-group,  randomized,  active-controlled,  double-blind,  multicenter  trial  to evaluate  the  immunogenicity,  safety,  and  tolerability  of  13vPnC  compared  with  7vPnC  in  healthy infants. The trial was conducted at 56 sites in Germany.

-  Study population /Sample size

Approximately  600  subjects  (300  subjects  per  group)  were  to  be  enrolled  in  this  study  in  order  to achieve 270 evaluable subjects per group.

-  Treatments

Subjects  were to be  randomly  assigned  (in  a  1:1  ratio  prospectively)  to  receive  either  13vPnC  and Infanrix hexa or 7vPnC and Infanrix hexa given in a 2-, 3-, 4- (infant series) and 11- to 12- (toddler dose) month schedule.

-  Outcomes/endpoints

AEs were to be recorded on the eCRF based on ancillary information on the e-diary, clinical evaluation during a study visit, and verbal questioning of the parent about the child's health since the last visit. AEs were recorded from the signing of the ICF to visit 4 and from visit 5 to visit 6.

At  visit  5,  any  newly  diagnosed  chronic  medical  conditions  since  visit  4  were  recorded.  All  serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded from the signing of the ICF to 6 months after the last study vaccination.

A telephone contact was to be made 6 months after the last study vaccination to record any newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions, hospitalizations, SAEs, and other reportable information (ORI) that occurred since the last study visit.

-  Statistical Methods

The data are descriptive.

##  Results

-  Recruitment/ Number analysed

The actual  number  of  vaccinated  subjects  was  603,  ie,  300  subjects  in  the  13vPnC  group  and  303 subjects in the 7vPnC group. The actual number of subjects who completed the toddler dose of study vaccine was 574, ie, 289 subjects in the 13vPnC group and 285 subjects in the 7vPnC group (including

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

blood draw). A total of 578 subjects completed the 6-month follow-up, 288 in the 13vPnC group and 290 subjects in the 7vPnC group.

The safety population for this report totaled 578 subjects.

Of  these,  4  subjects  received  an  incorrect  vaccination  and  are  not  included  in  the  summary  tables (none of them had AEs). Subjects were analyzed according to the vaccine actually administered; thus, the summary table shows 574 subjects, 287 subjects in each of the vaccine groups.



Efficacy results

N.a.

-  Safety results

AEs were reported for 20 (7.0%) subjects in the 13vPnC group and 22 (7.7%) subjects in the 7vPnC group.  These  AEs  reflected  common  childhood  illnesses  and  accidents.  The  AEs  categorized  as infections  and  infestations  were  reported  most  frequently  in  both  vaccine  groups.  The  individual  AE with the highest incidence was gastroenteritis, which occurred in 6 subjects overall (3 subjects, 1.0%, in  each  of  the  2  vaccine  groups).  When  data  for  all  AEs  were  analyzed,  no  significant  differences between  vaccine  groups  were  noted.  Moreover,  none  of  the  AEs  were  considered  related  to  study vaccine.

A  total  of  18  severe  AEs  were  reported  for  11  subjects  overall,  including  6  (2.1%)  subjects  in  the 13vPnC group and 5 (1.7%) subjects in the 7vPnC group. The most frequently reported severe AE was gastroenteritis, which occurred in 2 (0.7%) subjects in each of the vaccine groups.

SAEs were reported for 11 (3.8%) subjects in the 13vPnC group and 14 (4.9%) subjects in the 7vPnC group. SAEs categorized as infections and infestations were reported most frequently in both vaccine groups. Of the individual SAEs, the highest incidence was for gastroenteritis, which was reported in 6 subjects  overall  (3  subjects,  1.0%,  in  each  of  the  2  vaccine  groups).  There  were  no  significant differences between vaccine groups for SAEs, and none were considered related to study vaccine. None of the SAEs were life-threatening.

There were no deaths reported during the 6-month follow-up period.

Assessor's comment: The definition of severe AEs was not included in the study protocol, other than that  all  adverse  events  were  defined  as  mild  moderate  severe  or  life  threatening.  The  standard definition of Serious Adverse events (SAEs) was used. However, considering that none of the adverse events were considered related to the vaccine, this issue is of less importance.

A Phase 3, Randomized, Active-Controlled, Double-blind Trial Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Infants Given With Routine Pediatric Vaccinations in Italy

##  Description

Only a brief description of the study will be included as it has already been assessed during the original MAA procedure.

-  Methods

##  Objective(s)

Demonstrate that the immune response after Infanrix hexa (antigen assessed:

HBV) and 13vPnC is non-inferior to the response after Infanrix hexa and 7vPnC measured 1 month after the toddler dose.

Assess the immune response to 13vPnC measured 1 month after the infant series and just before the toddler dose.

Assess  the  immune  responses  induced  by  13vPnC  relative  to  7vPnC  measured  1  month  after  the toddler dose.

-  Study design

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This  was  a  phase  3,  parallel-group,  randomized,  active-controlled,  double-blind,  multicenter  trial  to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and  immunogenicity  of 13vPnC  given with routine pediatric vaccinations in healthy infants.

##  Study population /Sample size

Approximately 600 subjects were to participate in this study at approximately 10 to 30 sites. Enrolled subjects  were  randomly  assigned  at  a  ratio  of  1:1  into  1  of  the  2  vaccine  groups  to  receive  either 13vPnC + Infanrix hexa or 7vPnC + Infanrix hexa. Three hundred (300) subjects were to be enrolled in each vaccine group to obtain a final number of 225 evaluable subjects per group at the toddler dose.

##  Treatments

Each subject was to receive 1 dose (0.5 mL) of either 13vPnC or 7vPnC together with a concomitant dose (0.5 mL) of Infanrix hexa at each of the 3 vaccination visits.

##  Outcomes/endpoints

Each subject's parent(s)/legal guardian(s) was contacted by telephone approximately 6 months after the last study vaccination and asked to report any hospitalizations, serious adverse events (SAEs), or newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions that occurred since the last study visit.

##  Statistical Methods

The data are descriptive.

##  Results

##  Recruitment/ Number analysed

604 subjects received the first infant series dose, 589 received the second dose, and 569 received the toddler  dose.  Of  those  who  received the  toddler  dose,  285  and 281  subjects  completed the  toddler dose period in the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups, respectively. After the toddler dose interval, 2 subjects in the 7vPnC group were withdrawn from the study, so that 285 and 279 subjects completed the study. Because a telephone contact was to be attempted on all subjects 6 months after their last vaccination (regardless of the number of vaccinations), the numbers of subjects for the 6-month follow-up period were greater than the numbers of subjects completing the study. In the 13vPnC group, 290 subjects entered and all completed the 6-month follow-up. In the 7vPnC group, 288 subjects entered and 286 subjects completed the 6-month follow-up.

##  Efficacy results

N.a.

-  Safety results

AEs were reported for 21 subjects during the relevant period, 10 (3.3%) in the 13vPnC group and 11 (3.6%) in  the  7vPnC  group.  The  AEs  categorized  as  infections  and  infestations  were  reported  most frequently in both vaccine groups. Of the individual AEs, the highest incidence was for gastroenteritis (4 [1.3%] subjects in the 7vPnC group) and febrile convulsion (2 [0.7%] subjects for 13vPnC and 1 [0.3%] subject for 7vPnC). When data for all AEs were analyzed, no significant differences between vaccine  groups  were  noted  for  any  AE.  None  of  the  AEs  reported  were  considered  to  be  related  to study vaccine.

Four (4) severe AEs were reported for 3 subjects in the 7vPnC group and none were reported for the 13vPnC  group.  The  severe  AEs  included  atrioventricular  block,  bronchitis,  and  pneumonia.  No  lifethreatening AEs were reported. There were no deaths reported during the 6-month follow-up period. SAEs  were  reported  during  the  6  month  follow-up  period  for  20  subjects,  9  (3.0%)  in  the  13vPnC group  and  11  (3.6%)  in  the  7vPnC  group.  SAEs  categorized  as  infections  and  infestations  were reported most frequently in both vaccine groups. Of the individual SAEs, the highest incidence was for gastroenteritis (4 [1.3%] subjects in the 7vPnC group) and febrile convulsion (2 [0.7%] subjects for 13vPnC  and  1  [0.3%]  subject  for  7vPnC).  As  with  the  AEs,  there  were  no  significant  differences between vaccine groups for SAEs and none of the SAEs were considered to be related to study vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A Phase 3, Randomized, Active-Controlled, Double-blind Trial Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Infants Given With Routine Pediatric Vaccinations in Spain.

##  Description

Only a brief description of the study will be included as it has already been assessed during the original MAA procedure.

##  Methods

##  Objective(s)

Demonstrate that the immune response after Meningitec (antigen assessed: MnC by SBA) and 13vPnC is non-inferior to response after Meningitec and 7vPnC measured 1 month after a 2-dose Meningitec infant series.

Assess the non-inferiority of antigen-specific response to PT, FHA, PRN, Dip, Tet, and polio types 1, 2, 3 after Infanrix hexa and 13vPnC relative to Infanrix hexa and 7vPnC.

Assess the immune responses to 13vPnC measured 1 month after dose 2 and 1 month after dose 3 of the infant series and 1 month after the toddler dose.

##  Study design

This  was  a  phase  3,  parallel-group,  randomized,  active-controlled,  double-blind,  multicenter  trial  to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 13vPnC in healthy infants.

##  Study population /Sample size

Approximately  600  subjects  (300  subjects  per  group)  were  to  be  enrolled  in  this  study  in  order  to achieve 270 evaluable subjects per group across 35 sites.

##  Treatments

Each subject was to receive 1 dose (0.5 mL) of either 13vPnC or 7vPnC together with 1 dose (0.5 mL) of each of the following concomitant vaccines: Infanrix hexa/Infanrix-IPV+Hib, Meningitec, and MMR II.

##  Outcomes/endpoints

Each subject's parent(s)/legal guardian(s) was contacted by telephone approximately 6 months after the  last  study  vaccination;  this  included  both  subjects  who  completed  the  study  and  those  who discontinued prematurely. They were asked to report any newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions, hospitalizations,  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  and  other  reportable  information  that  had  occurred since the last study visit.

##  Statistical Methods

The data are descriptive.

##  Results

##  Recruitment/ Number analysed

619 subjects were randomly assigned to study vaccine; 616 subjects received the first infant series dose, 605 received the second dose, 597 received the third dose, and 582 received the toddler dose. Five  hundred  seventy-nine  (579)  subjects  completed  the  toddler  dose  and  the  study.  Because  a telephone contact was to be attempted for all subjects 6 months after their last vaccination (regardless of the number of vaccinations), the numbers of subjects for the 6-month follow-up period were greater than the numbers of subjects completing the study. In the 13vPnC group, 299 subjects entered and all completed  the  6-month  follow-up.  In  the  7vPnC  group,  292  subjects  entered  and  289  subjects completed the 6-month follow-up.

##  Efficacy results

N.a.

##  Safety results

AEs were reported for 13 subjects during the relevant period, 6 (1.9%) in the 13vPnC group and 7 (2.3%) in  the  7vPnC  group.  The  AEs  categorized  as  infections  and  infestations  were  reported  most frequently  in  both  vaccine  groups.  When  data  for  all  AEs  were  analyzed,  no  significant  differences

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

between vaccine groups were noted for any AE. None of the AEs reported were considered related to study  vaccine.  Most  of  the  AEs  reported  were  the  types  of  conditions  and  symptoms  expected  in infants of this age. Four (4) severe AEs were reported for 1 subject (501-015-000813) in the 7vPnC group and none were reported for the 13vPnC group.

There were no deaths reported during the 6-month follow-up period.

SAEs were reported during this period for 9 subjects, 3 (1.0%) in the 13vPnC group and 6 (2.0%) in the  7vPnC  group.  SAEs  categorized  as  infections  and  infestations  were  reported  most  frequently  in both  vaccine  groups.  Of  the  individual  SAEs,  the  highest  incidence  in  the  13vPnC  group  was  for gastroenteritis  (2  subjects,  0.6%)  and  in  the  7vPnC  group  was  for  febrile  convulsion  (2  subjects, 0.7%). As with the AEs, there were no significant differences between vaccine groups for SAEs and none of the SAEs were considered related to study vaccine.

Study 6096A1-3005: Final Toddler Report: A Phase 3, Randomized, Active-Controlled, Double-Blind Trial  Evaluating  The  Safety,  Tolerability,  and  Immunogenicity  of  3  lots  of  13-  Valent  Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine In Healthy Infants given with Routine Pediatric Vaccinations in The United States.

##  Description

Only a brief description of the study will be included as it has already been assessed during the original MAA procedure. The immunogenicity and safety data from the toddler dose from Study 6096A1-3005 are presented in the CSR submitted at this time, however it should be noted that the infant series data were  already  submitted  as  part  of  the  MAA.  This  present  CSR  also  includes  the  additional  noninferiority  comparison  of  the  anti-polysaccharide  IgG  responses  after  the  infant  series  that  were submitted in response to questions during review of the MAA. The safety data collected after the infant series  (ie,  the  period  from  after  the  dose  3  blood  draw  to  the  toddler  dose  vaccination)  are  also described.

##  Methods

##  Objective(s)

Demonstrate that the immune responses induced by 3 lots of 13vPnC are equivalent at 1 month after the infant series.

Demonstrate the non-inferiority of immune response induced by Pediarix given with 13vPnC relative to Pediarix given with 7vPnC 1 month after the infant series (antigens assessed: Tet; polio types 1, 2, 3; HBV). (The results relating to this objective were assessed previously)

The secondary objective of this study was to demonstrate that the immune responses induced by the 3 lots of 13vPnC are equivalent when measured by serum IgG levels 1 month after the toddler dose.

##  Study design

This was a parallel-group, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial conducted to evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability,  and  immunogenicity  of  3  lots  of  13vPnC  in  healthy  infants  when coadministered with routine pediatric vaccinations.

##  Study population /Sample size

Approximately 1645 subjects (470 subjects in the 13vPnC pilot scale lot 1 group, 470 subjects in the 13vPnC pilot scale lot 2 group, 470 subjects in the 13vPnC manufacturing scale lot group, and 235 subjects in the 7vPnC group) were to participate in this study at approximately 85 sites, to achieve 1400  evaluable  subjects  (400  subjects  in  the  13vPnC  pilot  scale  lot  1  group,  400  subjects  in  the 13vPnC pilot scale lot  2 group, 400 subjects in the 13vPnC manufacturing scale lot group, and 200 subjects in the 7vPnC group).

##  Treatments

All subjects were to receive 1 dose (0.5 mL) of either 13vPnC or 7vPnC at each of the 4 vaccination visits along with a concomitant dose of Pediarix and Hib vaccine at the 2-, 4-, and 6-month visits, and with MMR, varicella, and hepatitis A vaccines at the 12-month visit according to their randomization.

##  Outcomes/endpoints

Blood samples (approximately 5 mL) were to be collected at visit 4 (28 to 42 days after the infant series) and at visit 6 (28 to 42 days after the toddler dose), with a total volume of approximately 10 mL of blood for the duration of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For subjects in the 7vPnC and 13vPnC groups, serum concentrations of anticapsular IgG for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined for each blood sample and expressed as micrograms per milliliter (μg/mL).

For each of the concomitant vaccine antigen responses described below, the assays were performed for all subjects in the 7vPnC group, and for an equal number of subjects from the 13vPnC groups:

-  Serum levels of IgG antibodies to tetanus toxoid were measured using an antitetanus toxoid ELISA  performed  on  blood  samples  collected  1  month  after  the  infant  series.  Results  were reported as international units per milliliter (IU/mL).
-  Serum levels of antibody to poliovirus (strains 1, 2, and 3) were measured using a polio in vitro  plaque  neutralization  assay  performed  on  blood  samples  collected  1  month  after  the infant series. Results were reported as antibody titers.
-  Serum levels of antibody to HBsAg were measured using an FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic kit  and  performed  on  blood  samples  collected  1  month  after  the  infant  series.  Results  were reported as milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL).
-  Statistical Methods

The pneumococcal IgG serotype antibody concentrations were logarithmically transformed for analysis. Within  each  lot  and  for  each  antibody  concentration  separately,  geometric  means  of  the  antibody concentration at each of the visits were calculated and rank ordered from lowest (1) to highest (3). Two  (2)-sided,  95%  CIs  were  constructed  by  back  transformation  of  the  CIs  for  the  mean  of  the logarithmically transformed assay results computed using the Student t distribution. In addition, the ratio  of  the  GMCs  and  corresponding  2-sided,  95%  CIs  were  computed  to  aid  in  interpretation  of results. For the geometric mean ratio, the CIs were computed using the Student t distribution for the mean difference of the measures on the log scale (lowest relative to middle, lowest relative to highest and  middle  relative  to  highest).  To  evaluate  equivalency  among  the  3  lots,  the  equivalence  test  of Wiens and Iglewicz was used.

For  each  of  the  pneumococcal  serotypes,  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  a  serum  IgG  ≥0.35 µg/mL and the proportion of subjects achieving a serum IgG ≥1.00 µg/mL 1 month after the infant series  and  1  month  after  the  toddler  dose  were  computed.  In  addition,  the  proportions  of  subjects achieving antibody concentration ≥0.15 μg/mL 1 month after the infant series and 1 month after the toddler  dose  were  computed.  Exact,  unconditional,  2-sided,  95%  CIs  on  the  pairwise  difference  in proportions were calculated to aid in interpretation of results. The CIs were computed using the noninferiority procedure of Chan and Zhang, using the standardized test statistics and gamma=0.000001. To evaluate the consistency among the 3 lots, the equivalence test of Wiens and Iglewicz was used. The 3 lots of 13vPnC were to be considered equivalent if, for all 13 serotypes, the maximum difference between any 2 lots is less than 0.693 and greater than -0.693 using the equivalence testing procedure for 3 vaccine groups given by Wiens and Iglewicz. Similar descriptive procedures were used for other time points.

##  Results

##  Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 1712 subjects were randomly assigned in a 2:2:2:1 ratio to receive 13vPnC pilot scale lot 1, 13vPnC pilot scale lot 2, 13vPnC manufacturing scale lot, or 7vPnC, together with concomitant Pediarix and Hib vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months of age for the infant series. However, of the 1712 randomly assigned subjects, 3 subjects (2 randomly assigned subjects to 13vPnC pilot scale lot 2 and 1 subject assigned to 13vPnC manufacturing scale lot) had not given consent to be in the study, and thus were withdrawn from the study prior to receiving study vaccine. A total of 1508 subjects were previously reported as completing the infant series (see section 8.1 in infant CSR-74251), however, the data for 1 subject randomly assigned to 13vPnC manufacturing scale lot changed after the analysis of the infant series. Therefore, 1507 subjects (88.0%) completed the infant series.

A total of 76 subjects (4.4%) were withdrawn after the infant series (after the blood draw following dose 3 of the infant series up to administration of the toddler dose); a similar percentage of subjects were withdrawn after the infant series from each 13vPnC group (4.1% in the pilot scale lot 1 group, 5.9% in the pilot scale lot 2 group, and 3.7% in the manufacturing scale lot group) and the 7vPnC group (3.7%). An additional 3 subjects (0.1%) with an unknown completion status also withdrew after the infant series, but the study conclusion form was completed at a subsequent visit. The remaining 1428 subjects  (1220  in  the  13vPnC  groups  and  208  in  the  7vPnC  group)  were  vaccinated  with  the toddler dose and made up the safety population. A total of 25 subjects (1.5%) were withdrawn during the toddler dose period before the blood sample was obtained (17 in the 13vPnC groups and 8 subjects in the 7vPnC group). Thus, 1403 subjects (82.0%) completed the toddler dose portion of the study. A telephone contact was to be attempted for all subjects 6 months after their last vaccination (including

subjects who did not complete the study because of early discontinuation). Of the 1464 subjects who agreed to be contacted, 1430 subjects 85.3%, 83.2%, and 83.0% in the 13vPnC groups, and 81.7% in the  7vPnC  group)  completed  the  6-month  follow-up  telephone  contact.  A  total  of  1376  subjects (80.4%) completed the study; a similar percentage of subjects completed the study from each 13vPnC group  (82.4%,  78.7%,  and  80.4%  in  the  13vPnC  groups)  and  the  7vPnC  group  (79.7%).  Twentyseven (27) subjects were withdrawn after the toddler dose. One (1) subject (13vPnC pilot scale lot 1) was withdrawn because of an SAE; the remaining 26 subjects were lost to follow-up.

##  Efficacy results

This  assessment  report  presents  the  planned  assessments  of  pneumococcal  immune  responses  in 13vPnC lots measured 1 month after the toddler dose (visit 6), a secondary objective of the study. In addition,  this  report  presents  the  additional  assessments  of  pneumococcal  immune  responses measured  1  month  after  the  toddler  dose  in  the  7vPnC  group,  and  varicella  and  mumps  immune responses measured 1 month after the toddler dose.

## Immune Response to Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines

The three 13vPnC lots were determined to be equivalent across all serotypes as confidence intervals for  the  differences  between  each  2-way  comparison  of  vaccine  lots,  expressed  as  the  natural  logtransformed geometric mean concentration (GMC) values, was less than the absolute value of 0.693 (2-fold criterion). The differences between vaccine lots in log-transformed geometric means were small for all serotypes (table 9-2). Across the common serotypes, the largest differences were 0.18 for lot 1 to lot 2 (serotype 6B), -0.37 for lot 1 to the manufacturing scale lot (serotype 19F), and -0.33 for lot 2 to the manufacturing scale lot (serotype 19F). Across the additional serotypes, the largest differences were 0.17 for lot 1 to lot 2 (serotype 5), 0.10 for lot 1 to the manufacturing scale lot (serotypes 5 and 6A), and -0.13 for lot 2 to the manufacturing scale lot (serotype 3). Similar results were seen for the all-available population.

The percentage of responders in the evaluable pneumococcal toddler immunogenicity population with antibody concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL for the 7 common serotypes was at least 98.3% for the 3 lots. For  the  6  additional  serotypes,  the  percentage  of  responders  was  at  least  99.1%  for  all  serotypes except serotype 3, where the percentage of responders was 83.6% for the pilot lot 1 group, 80.8% for the pilot lot 2 group, and 88.5% for the manufacturing lot group. Similar results were seen in the allavailable toddler immunogenicity population for all 13 serotypes.

The percentage of responders in the evaluable pneumococcal toddler immunogenicity population with antibody concentrations ≥1.00 μg/mL for the 7 common serotypes of the three 13vPnC lots was at least  79.6% (Table 9-4). For the 6 additional serotypes, the percentage of responders was at least 91.0%  for  all  serotypes  except  serotype  3,  where  the  percentage  of  responders  with  antibody concentrations ≥1.00 μg/mL was 32.0%, 30.3%, and 36.8% for the 3 lots of 13vPnC. Similar results were seen in the all-available toddler immunogenicity population for all 13 serotypes.

A non-inferiority comparison of the anti-polysaccharide IgG responses after the infant series and after the toddler dose was performed during the procedure and submitted in response to questions. These analyses showed that the responses to the 7 common serotypes in 13vPnC were non-inferior to the 7vPnC responses. Additional analyses comparing the responses to the 6 additional serotypes to the lowest responder to the 7 common serotypes in 7vPnC recipients are presented in the CSR. These data showed that responses to the 6 additional  serotypes  were  non-inferior  for  all  serotypes,  except  for serotype 3. At the additional comparison level of ≥0.15 μg/mL, non-inferiority criterion was met for all 13 serotypes, including serotype 3. And, when compared to the actual responses in 7vPnC recipients, the responses to the 6 additional serotypes, including serotype 3, were superior in 13vPnC recipients. These data are similar to what was seen in the US pivotal trial, study 004. The inability of the serotype 3 response to meet the non-inferiority criteria in these 2 studies performed in a US infant population is very different from the responses to serotype 3 in all other phase 3 clinical trials which were higher. These  studies  were  performed  in  various  European  countries  using  several  infant  vaccination schedules. The differences in responses cannot be attributed to differences in vaccine or monovalent conjugated serotype 3 bulk substance, because common vaccine and drug substance lots were used across studies. The reason for the relatively lower responses seen in the US trials is unknown.

## Responses to concomitant vaccine antigens

Varivax was to be administered concomitantly with 13vPnC or 7vPnC at the 12-month visit. Responses to  the  varicella  antigen  in  Varivax  were  evaluated  at  2  prespecified  antibody  levels  associated  with seroconversion  (≥1.25  gpELISA  units/mL)  and  long-term  protection  (≥5.00  gpELISA  units/mL).  The proportion of responders in the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups were similar. All (100%) Varivax recipients in both the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups achieved antibody levels ≥1.25 gpELISA units/mL; 98.8% and 97.7%  in  the  13vPnC  and  7vPnC  groups,  respectively,  achieved  antibody  levels  ≥5.00  gpELISA units/mL.

Geometric  mean  values  were  15.38  gpELISA  units/mL  in  the  13vPnC  combined  group  and  16.04 gpELISA units/mL in the 7vPnC group. The geometric mean ratio (13vPnC/ 7vPnC) was 0.96 and the ratio at the lower limit of the 95% CI was 0.85.

The  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  evaluable  concomitant  vaccine  toddler  immunogenicity  population achieving  a  mumps  serum  antibody  titer  ≥10.0  antibody  (Ab)  units/mL  was  95.7%  in  the  13vPnC combined group and 97.6% in the 7vPnC group. The difference (13vPnC combined  - 7vPnC) in the proportion of responders between vaccine groups was -1.9, and the difference at the lower limit of the 95% CI was -6.5.

The geometric mean levels of mumps antibodies after the toddler dose were 58.55 Ab units/mL for the 13vPnC combined group and 66.91 Ab units/mL  for  the  7vPnC  group  in  the  evaluable  concomitant vaccine toddler immunogenicity population. The ratio (13vPnC/ 7vPnC) was 0.88 and the ratio at the lower limit of the 95% CI was 0.71.

-  Safety results

## Safety results after the toddler dose

The endpoints for the safety analysis were the incidence of local reactions, systemic events, and AEs. Parent(s)/legal  guardian(s)  were  required to  monitor  the  occurrence  of  local  reactions  and  systemic events that occurred within 7 days after the toddler dose and enter these into an e-diary.

Local  reactions  included  tenderness,  induration,  and  erythema  at  the  site  of  the  pneumococcal conjugate injection. The systemic events specified in the protocol were fever (core [rectal] temperature of  equal  to  or  greater  than  100.4°F  [38.0°C])  and  use  of  antipyretic  medications  to  treat  and  to prevent symptoms, as well as decreased appetite, irritability, hives (urticaria),  increased  sleep,  and decreased sleep. The severity of local reactions was also assessed and reported in the e-diary.

Adverse events were to be collected from the signing of the informed consent until the infant series blood draw at 1 month after dose 3 and between visit 5 and visit 6. All SAEs were to be recorded from the  signing  of  the  informed  consent  to  6  months  after  the  last  study  vaccination  when  a  telephone contact was to be made to record any newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions, hospitalizations, SAEs,  and  other  reportable  information  that  occurred  since  the  last  study  visit.  Presented  in  this section are the safety results from the toddler dose and the 6-month follow-up telephone contact. Safety data from the infant series visits were presented and assessed previously.

## Reactogenicity

A summary of local reaction reported wihthi 7 days of the toddler dose is presented in Table 10-1. The frequency of subjects with at least 1 local reaction was similar in the 13vPnC combined group (69.0%) and the 7vPnC group (75.2%; Table 10-1). Most local reactions were mild in severity.

The number and percentage of subjects with systemic events within 7 days after the toddler dose are summarized  in  Table  10-3.  Overall,  the  percentage  of  subjects  having  1  or  more  systemic  events, excluding the use of antipyretic medications, was 90.5% in the 13vPnC combined group and 88.9% in the 7vPnC group. There were no significant differences between the vaccine groups in the incidence of individual systemic events or for any systemic event.

## Other adverse events

During the toddler dose, ie, the period from the toddler dose to the blood draw after the toddler dose, 438 subjects (36.2%) in the 13vPnC combined group had 728 AEs and 76 subjects (36.5%) in the 7vPnC group had 138 AEs. The AEs categorized under infections and infestations were reported most frequently  in  both  vaccine  groups,  with  otitis  media  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  being  the most  common  infections.  Otitis  media  was  reported  in  70  recipients  (5.8%)  of  13vPnC  and  20 recipients (9.6%) of 7vPnC, and upper respiratory tract infection was reported in 62 recipients (5.1%) of 13vPnC and 11 recipients (5.3%) of 7vPnC. No statistically significant differences between vaccine groups  in  the  incidence  of  AEs  were  observed  for  any  system  organ  class;  however,  a  significantly (p=0.045)  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  7vPnC  group  had  otitis  media  than  in  the  13vPnC combined group and a significantly (p=0.044) higher percentage of subjects in the 7vPnC group had constipation than in the 13vPnC combined group.

During  the  toddler  dose  7  subjects  (0.6%)  in  the  13vPnC  combined  group  had  8  severe  or  lifethreatening AEs and 2 subjects (1.0%) in the 7vPnC group had 3 events. A single life-threatening AE, near drowning, was reported in a 13vPnC recipient. No event considered severe occurred in multiple subjects. No statistically significant differences between vaccine groups were noted for individual AEs, however,  in  the  system  organ  class  of  gastrointestinal  disorders,  a  significantly  (p=0.021)  higher percentage  of  7vPnC  recipients  than  13vPnC  recipients  reported  severe  AEs.  This  included  severe diarrhea in 1 subject and severe constipation in 1 subject; both subjects were recipients of 7vPnC.

During the toddler dose 21 recipients (1.7%) of 13vPnC had 24 related AEs and 1 recipient (0.5%) of 7vPnC had a related AE. The most frequent related AEs were in the category of general disorders and administration site conditions. The majority of these events occurred at concomitant vaccine injection sites, and the others described reactions that were not captured in the e-diary (bruising or 'knot' at injection  site).  The  most  frequent  related  AEs  were  pyrexia  and  rash.  Pyrexia  assessed  as  related occurred  in  3  recipients  (0.2%)  of  13vPnC  and  1  recipient  (0.5%)  of  7vPnC.  All  4  cases  of  rash assessed  as  related  were  reported  in  4  recipients  (0.3%)  of  13vPnC.  No  statistically  significant differences between vaccine groups were noted for any related AE.

During the toddler dose, 9 recipients (0.7%) of 13vPnC had a total of 11 SAEs and 1 recipient (0.5%) of  7vPnC  had  3  SAEs.  The  most  common  SAEs  were  in  the  category  of  infections  and  infestations, which were in 0.3% of subjects in the 13vPnC combined group and 0.5% of subjects in the 7vPnC group. No statistically significant differences between vaccine groups were noted in the incidence of SAEs.

One (1) SAE was assessed as related to study vaccine. Subject 3005-040-003830 received the 13vPnC manufacturing lot at the toddler dose and concomitant MMR, varicella, and HAV. Four (4) days later the  subject  had  bronchial  hyperreactivity,  which  was  considered  to  be  of  moderate  severity. Approximately 8 months preceding this event, 2 days after receiving dose 2 of the infant series, the subject  also  had  an  SAE  of  bronchiolitis,  which  was  considered  to  be  of  moderate  severity  and  not related to the study vaccine.

No subjects were withdrawn because of AEs during the toddler dose.

No deaths were reported after the toddler dose.

## 6 months follow-up after the infant dose

Summaries of the AEs to be reported after the infant series, up until the toddler dose are provided below. After the infant series, 111 subjects (7.7%) in the 13vPnC combined group had 140 AEs and 14 subjects (5.7%) in the 7vPnC group had 15 AEs. In addition, an AE was reported for 1 subject who received a vaccination other than the randomly assigned vaccine during the infant series.

The  AEs  reported  most  frequently  after  the  infant  series  were  categorized  as  infections  and infestations,  including  38  events  in  32  recipients  of  13vPnC  (2.2%)  and  2  events  in  2  recipients  of 7vPnC  (0.8%);  and  as  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders,  including  29  events  in  25 recipients of 13vPnC (1.7%) and 6 events in 5 recipients of 7vPnC (2.0%). The incidence of individual AEs did not exceed 1.0%  of recipients of either study vaccine; rhinitis allergic, bronchial hyperreactivity, and eczema had the highest incidences and were reported by no more than 0.8% of

recipients of either study vaccine. Any differences between the 13vPnC combined and 7vPnC groups were not statistically significant.

After the infant series, 25 severe or life threatening AEs were reported in 17 subjects (1.2%) in the 13vPnC combined group and 2 events in 2 subjects (0.8%) in the 7vPnC group. None of the severe or life threatening AEs after the infant series were related to study vaccination.

One (1) of  the  AEs  was  life  threatening.  Subject  3005-038-003637  was  hospitalized  for  respiratory arrest. This AE resolved on the day of onset.

No significant differences were observed between the 13vPnC combined group and the 7vPnC group.

Thirty-seven (37) SAEs were reported in 25 recipients of 13vPnC (1.7%) and 3 SAEs were reported in 3  recipients  of  7vPnC  (1.2%)  after  the  infant  series.  In  addition,  1  SAE  (respiratory  syncytial  virus bronchiolitis) was reported in a subject who received a vaccination other than the randomly assigned vaccine. None of the SAEs were considered related to the vaccine. The most common SAEs were those categorized  as  infections  and  infestations.  Serious  infections  occurred  in  17  recipients  of  13vPnC (1.2%), which includes the 1 subject who received a vaccination other than the randomly assigned vaccine. Cellulitis was the most common event in this category and occurred in 3 recipients of 13vPnC (0.2%); no recipients of 7vPnC reported cellulitis. Among the recipients of 7vPnC, 1 subject (0.4%) had a serious infection of pneumonia. No statistically significant differences between vaccine groups were noted in the incidence of SAEs.

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

MAH overall conclusions:

Additional  pneumococcal immunogenicity data from study 3005 show that the responses elicited by 13vPnC in its final formulation are comparable and non-inferior to those elicited by 7vPnC following a 2, 4, 6-month infant series and following the toddler dose. The results from study 3005 also indicate that coadministration of 13vPnC does not interfere with responses to mumps or varicella antigens in comparison with results following coadminstration of 7vPnC.

The  toddler  dose  safety  data  from  study  3005  demonstrated  similar  rates  of  local  reactions  and systemic  events  among  13vPnC  and  7vPnC  recipients.  There  were  no  differences  in  the  rates  and nature of SAEs and other AEs associated with 13vPnC compared with 7vPnC in the additional safety data from studies 006, 500, 501, and 3005. The safety profile of 13vPnC was shown to be comparable with 7vPnC and the frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has not changed compared with the frequency reported in the MAA.

The data presented in this Article 46 submission package does not alter the benefit-risk assessment of 13vPnC.

## III. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

Immunogenicity: The results of study 3005 confirm what was reported during the MAA procedure. The responses to serotype 3 were considerably lower than to the other serotypes, which was also seen in the  previously  reported  clinical  trials.  Many  of  the  data  presented  in  the  clinical  study  report  were already discussed during the procedure, and will not be addressed again here.

Safety: The results presented confirm the previous safety profile of Prevenar 13. No new safety signals were detected.
