## 2. Clinical study

6096A-3016;  FINAL  REPORT:  PILOT:  Characterization  of  the  Prevnar  Infant  Long-Term  Immune Response Versus a Prevnar-Naive Cohort

##  Description

Study 6096A1-3016 is part of the global clinical development program for the use of Prevenar 13 in infants  and  children.  Study  6096A1-3016  was  conducted  in  United  States  in  subjects  who  were originally  enrolled  in  the  pivotal  phase  3  safety,  immunogenicity,  and  efficacy  study  for  7vPnC (protocol  D118-P8).  Subjects  in  the  study  6096A1-3016  were  11 to  14  years  of  age  at the  time of vaccination. This study was designed to characterize the 'late' immune response to an additional dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PnC) more than 10 years after primary vaccination with 7vPnC in infancy versus a 7vPnC-naïve cohort.

##  Methods

-  Objectives

The primary objective of the study was to characterize the 'late' immune response to an additional dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine more than 10 years after primary vaccination with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPnC) in infancy versus a 7vPnCnaïve cohort.

The  exploratory  objective  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  kinetics  of  secondary  immune  responses  in order to measure serotype-specific anti-pneumococcal immunoglobulin G (IgG) and opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) titer.

The safety objective was to evaluate the safety profile of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC)  as  measured  by  the  rate  of  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  adverse  events  (AEs),  and solicited local reactions and systemic events in the 2 groups.

-  Study design

This was a single-center open-label, nonrandomized study in which all children received a single dose of 13vPnC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Study population /Sample size

Children  were  recruited  based  on  their  prior  participation  in  a  pneumococcal  conjugate  versus meningococcal C conjugate (MnCC) clinical study conducted at Northern California Kaiser Permanente (NCKP) in California, United States, between 1995 and 1998 (protocol D118-P8). More than 38,000 subjects were enrolled in the original study and were randomized to receive a primary series of the Wyeth investigational 7vPnC (now licensed and marketed in the United States as Prevnar) or MnCC (now licensed and marketed outside the United States as Meningitec) at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age. Subjects from both vaccine groups were recruited in the current study to return to receive a single dose of 13vPnC at visit 1.

A sufficient number of subjects (approximately 75) was to be enrolled within 6 months to ensure at least 50 evaluable subjects (25 per group):

-  25 fully vaccinated per-protocol subjects (4 doses of vaccine given at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age) originally enrolled in the 7vPnC group of the study, and
-  25 fully vaccinated per-protocol subjects originally enrolled in the control group of the study (who received MnCC) who did not receive 7vPnC after the close of the study.
-  Treatments

All subjects received a single dose of Prevenar 13.

##  Outcomes/endpoints

Blood samples (approximately 30 mL total, 10 mL each at visits 1, 4, and 5) were collected from every subject prior to vaccination, on day 7 to 10, and on day 28 to 42 after vaccination.

Serum concentrations of anticapsular IgG for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined in all subjects for each blood sample using a standardized ELISA and expressed as μg/mL.

Serotype specific opsonophagocytic activity was determined using a modified microcolony opsonophagocytic assay (mcOPA) and expressed as a titer.

The  co-primary  endpoints  specified  in  the  protocol  were  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  a serotype-specific IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL by ELISA and the proportion of subjects achieving a titer  ≥1:8  by  OPA  for  each  of  the  pneumococcal  serotypes  at  visit  5  (28  to  42  days  after  vaccine administration).  These  endpoints  were  selected  based  on  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO) guideline for evaluation of pneumococcal serotypes.

However, based on the use of the microcolony OPA (mcOPA) assay instead of the planned dribble OPA (dOAP)  assay,  an  OPA  responder  was  defined  as  a  subject  with  an  OPA  titer  ≥lower  limit  of quantitation (LLOQ). Analyses using an OPA ≥1:8 were also reported. In addition, the proportion of subjects achieving a serotype-specific IgG concentration ≥1.0 μg/mL by ELISA was calculated.

##  Statistical Methods

For each serotype, exact, unconditional, 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on the proportions of subjects achieving IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL, OPA titers ≥1:8, IgG concentration ≥1.0 μg/mL and OPA titers ≥LLOQ were calculated. To assess treatment differences, exact, unconditional, 2-sided, 95% CIs on the difference in proportions (7vPnC/13vPnC - MnCC/13vPnC) were calculated.

Within each vaccine group and for each antibody concentration or titer, geometric mean concentrations/titers  (GMCs/GMTs)  were  calculated.  Each  concentration/titer  was  logarithmically transformed for analysis. Two (2)-sided, 95% CIs were constructed by back transformation of the CI for  the  mean  of  the  logarithmically  transformed  assay  results  computed  using  the  Student  t distribution. The geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) in antibody concentration/titers (postvaccination/prevaccination) were summarized by geometric means and 95% CIs, also computed using  the  logarithmically  transformed  assay  results.  To  assess  differences  between  the  2  vaccine groups, 2-sided, 95% CIs for the ratio [(7vPnC/13vPnC)/(MnCC/13vPnC)] of the GMCs and the GMTs were  constructed.  In  addition,  the  ratio  of  the  GMFRs  and  corresponding  2-sided,  95%  CIs  were calculated.  The  CIs  were  computed  using  the  Student  t  distribution  for  the  mean  difference  of  the measures on the logarithmic scale (7vPnC/13vPnC relative to MnCC/13vPnC).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) were presented graphically by vaccination group for each serotype-specific pneumococcal IgG concentration and OPA titer before and after vaccination.

The kinetics of the immune response were described by graphical representations of summary values over time for the immunogenicity endpoints.

The safety variables were AEs, local reactions, systemic events including fever, and vital signs. Fever was defined as an oral temperature ≥38.0°C (100.4°F). The proportion of subjects with local reactions and systemic events reported on any day within the 4-day period after vaccination was summarized for each type of event. Use of antipyretic medication was reported with systemic events, but these were analyzed separately.

AEs were categorized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the incidence of each type of event (MedDRA preferred term) was summarized.

Comparisons  between  the  vaccine  groups  were  performed  using  a  2-sided  Fisher's  exact  test.  All summaries show the  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  with  at  least  1  event  and  the  number  of events. Additional summaries by AE severity or by vaccine relationship were also produced.

##  Results

##  Recruitment/ Number analysed

Of  the  75  enrolled  subjects,  74  (98.7%)  subjects  were  included  in  the  all-available  immunogenicity population and 73 (97.3%) subjects were included in both the evaluable immunogenicity population and the evaluable kinetic population.

One (1) subject (1.3%) in the MnCC/13vPnC group did not receive the 13vPnC vaccination and was excluded from  the all-available  immunogenicity  population because  no  assay  results for  any pneumococcal  serotypes  were  available.  Two  (2)  subjects  (2.7%)  were  excluded  from  both  the evaluable immunogenicity population and the evaluable kinetic population: 1 subject was not in the allavailable  immunogenicity  population  (above  mentioned  subject),  and  1  subject  received  prohibited concomitant vaccines.

##  Efficacy results

## Proportion of Subjects Achieving IgG Concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL

The proportions of subjects in the evaluable immunogenicity population achieving a pneumococcal IgG concentration  ≥0.35  μg/mL  before  vaccination  with  13vPnC  (visit  1)  were  generally  similar  for  the assessed serotypes between the 2 groups and greater than or equal to 62.9% with the exception of serotype 4 (≥28.0%).

For the 7 serotypes present in 7vPnC, the proportion of subjects achieving IgG concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL at visit 5 (28 to 42 days after 13vPnC) was 100% for each serotype in both vaccine groups of the evaluable immunogenicity population, except for serotype 14 (97.1%) in the MnCC/13vPnC group (Table 9-3).

For the 6 additional serotypes in 13vPnC but not in 7vPnC the proportion of responders in both groups was 100% except for serotype 3 (94.7% and 97.0% in the 7vPnC/13vPnC and MnCC/13vPnC groups, respectively; Table 9-3).

Results for the all-available immunogenicity population were overall similar to those observed for the evaluable immunogenicity population.

## Proportion of Subjects Achieving OPA Titers ≥LLOQ

The proportions of subjects in the evaluable immunogenicity population achieving pneumococcal OPA titers ≥LLOQ before vaccination with 13vPnC (visit 1) were generally similar for the 2 groups. For the 7 serotypes present in 7vPnC, the proportion of subjects achieving OPA titers ≥LLOQ ranged from 21.4% (serotype 23F) to 90.6% (serotype 6B). For the 6 additional serotypes included in 13vPnC but not in 7vPnC, the proportion of responders ranged from 2.8% (serotype 5) to 72.7% (serotype 19A).

For  the  7  serotypes  present  in  7vPnC,  the  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  evaluable  immunogenicity population achieving OPA titers ≥LLOQ at visit 5 (28 to 42 days after vaccination) was 100% for each serotype in both vaccine groups except for serotype 19F (Table 9-4).

For the 6 additional serotypes in 13vPnC but not in 7vPnC, 100% of subjects in both groups achieved OPA titers ≥LLOQ for each serotype, with the exception of serotype 1, serotype 5 and serotype 19A.

Results for the all-available immunogenicity population were overall similar to those observed for the evaluable immunogenicity population.

## IgG Concentrations ≥1.0 μg/mL

The proportions of subjects in the evaluable immunogenicity population achieving pneumococcal IgG concentrations ≥1.0 μg/mL before vaccination with 13vPnC (visit 1) were generally similar between the 2 groups and greater than or equal to 31.6% with the exception of serotype 4 (≥16.0%).

For the 7 serotypes present in 7vPnC, the proportion of subjects achieving IgG concentrations ≥1.0 μg/mL at visit 5 (28 to 42 days after 13vPnC) was 100% for each serotype in both vaccine groups of the  evaluable  immunogenicity  population,  except  for  serotype  9V,  serotype  14  and  serotype  18C; (Table 9-5).

For the 6 additional serotypes in 13vPnC but not in 7vPnC the proportion of responders in both groups was  100%  for  each  serotype  except  for  serotype  1,  serotype  3  (81.6%  and  66.7%  in  the 7vPnC/13vPnC and MnCC/13vPnC groups, respectively), serotype 5 and serotype 7F (Table 9-5). None of the differences between the 2 groups were considered clinically relevant.

Results for the all-available immunogenicity population were overall similar to those observed for the evaluable immunogenicity population.

## IgG Geometric Mean Concentrations

Before vaccination with 13vPnC (visit 1), IgG GMCs in the evaluable immunogenicity population for all 13 serotypes were generally similar for the 2 vaccine groups (Table 9-7).

For the 7 serotypes present in 7vPnC, IgG GMCs at visit 5 in the 7vPnC/13vPnC group ranged from 5.72  μg/mL  (serotype 18C)  to  66.72  μg/mL  (serotype  6B;  Table  9-6).  In  the  MnCC/13vPnC  group, GMCs  ranged  from  2.92  μg/mL  (serotype  4)  to  22.62  μg/mL  (serotype  6B).  The  GMC  ratios (7vPnC/13vPnC to MnCC/13vPnC) ranged from 0.63 (serotype 18C) to 2.95 (serotype 6B) and were &gt;1.0 for 4 of the 7 serotypes; the lower limit of the 95% CI was &gt;1.0 for serotypes 4, 6B, 9V and 14.

For the 6 additional serotypes in 13vPnC but not in 7vPnC, the GMCs were generally similar between the  2  vaccine  groups.  In  the  7vPnC/13vPnC  group,  GMCs  ranged  from  2.13  μg/mL  (serotype  3)  to 29.11 μg/mL (serotype 6A). In the MnCC/13vPnC group, GMCs ranged from 1.71 μg/mL (serotype 3) to  20.17  μg/mL  (for  serotype  19A).  The  GMC  ratios  (7vPnC/13vPnC  to  MnCC/13vPnC)  ranged  from 0.90  (serotype  5)  to  1.81  (serotype  6A);  the  95%  CIs  included  1.0  for  all  serotypes  except  for serotype 7F where the lower limit was &gt;1.0.

Table 9-7 presents the pneumococcal IgG GMFRs from predose to visit 5 (28 through 42 days after 13vPnC)  for  the  evaluable  immunogenicity  population.  For  all  serotypes,  the  GMCs  increased  from predose to Visit 5.

Results for the all-available immunogenicity population were overall similar to those observed for the evaluable immunogenicity population.

## OPA Geometric Mean Titers

Before vaccination with 13vPnC (visit 1), OPA GMTs in the evaluable immunogenicity population for all 13 serotypes were, with some exceptions, generally similar between the 2 vaccine groups (Table 911). For the 7 serotypes present in 7vPnC, the GMT ratios (7vPnC/13vPnC to MnCC/13vPnC) ranged from 0.3 (serotype 9V) to 7.4 (serotype 23F).

For the 6 additional serotypes in 13vPnC but not in 7vPnC the GMT ratios ranged from 0.7 (serotypes 6A and 7F) to 1.9 (serotype 19A).

For the 7 serotypes present in 7vPnC, OPA GMTs at visit 5 were also generally similar in the 2 vaccine groups  (Table  9-10).  The  GMT  ratios  (7vPnC/13vPnC  to  MnCC/13vPnC)  ranged  from  0.6  (serotypes 19F and 23F) to 1.1 (serotype 6B). The upper limit of 95% CI was &lt;1.0 for serotype 23F; all other 95% CIs for the ratios included 1.0.

For the 6 additional serotypes in 13vPnC but not in 7vPnC, the GMTs were also generally similar for the 2 vaccine groups. The GMT ratios (7vPnC/13vPnC to MnCC/13vPnC) ranged from 0.9 (serotypes 5, 6A and 19A) to 1.3 (serotype 1); the 95% CIs for the ratios included 1.0 for all serotypes.

Results for the all-available immunogenicity population were overall similar to those observed for the evaluable immunogenicity population.

## Kinetics

## IgG Geometric Mean Concentrations

IgG concentrations over time for each of the serotypes in 13vPnC before vaccination with 13vPnC (visit 1)  and  after  vaccination  at  visits  4  and  5  were  presented  for  the  evaluable  kinetic  population. Representative examples ar shown in Figures 16-27 and 16-29.

The pneumococcal IgG GMCs in the evaluable kinetic population at the prevaccination visit 1 and the postvaccination visits 4 and 5 are summarized in Table 9-14.

For all the 13 serotypes, GMCs increased from visit 1 to visit 4, and further increased to visit 5 in both vaccine groups.

OPA Geometric Mean Titers

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

OPA GMTs over time for each of the serotypes in 13vPnC at visit 1 and after vaccination at visits 4 and 5 were presented for the evaluable kinetic population. Representative examples are shown in Figures 16.40 and 16.42. The pneumococcal  OPA  GMTs  in  the evaluable kinetic population at the prevaccination visit 1 and the postvaccination visits 4 and 5 are summarized in Table 9-15.

In general, GMTs increased in both vaccine groups over time, the exception being serotypes 3, 4 and 9V  for  both  vaccine  groups,  serotype  18C  for  the  7vPnC/13vPnC  group  and  serotype  1  for  the

MnCC/13vPnC group.

-  Safety results

Safety was evaluated by the incidence of reactogenicity, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). The safety population (n=74) included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study vaccine (38 in the 7vPnC/13vPnC and 36 in the MnCC/13vPnC groups).

Reactogenicity (local reactions included redness, swelling, and tenderness at the site of the injection and systemic events included decreased appetite, irritability, increased sleep, decreased sleep, rash, fever, and use of antipyretic medications) were monitored daily for 4 days after vaccination. AEs and SAEs were collected for all subjects from the day of consent until the last visit (6-month follow-up).

## Local Reactions

A total of 92.1% (n=35) of subjects in the 7vPnC/13vPnC group and 86.1% (n=31) of subjects in the MnCC/13vPnC group reported at least 1 local reaction during the 4 days after vaccination. Generally, the percentages of subjects with any local reactions were similar in both groups. Local reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity.

The  most  frequently  reported  local  reaction  was  tenderness;  92.1%  (n=35)  of  subjects  in  the 7vPnC/13vPnC group and 86.1% (n=31) of subjects in the MnCC/13vPnC group.

Significant tenderness (ie, interfered with limb movement) was reported by 4 (10.5%) subjects in the 7vPnC/13vPnC group and 7 (19.4%) subjects in the MnCC/13vPnC group.

## Systemic Events

The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  1  or  more  systemic  events  was  38.9%  (n=14)  in  the 7vPnC/13vPnC  group  and  42.9%  (n=15)  in  the  MnCC/13vPnC  group.  The  percentages  of  subjects reporting  any  individual  systemic  event  were  generally  similar  between  the  2  groups  except  for decreased appetite (7.9% [n=3] in the 7vPnC/13vPnC group and 16.7% [n=6] in the MnCC/13vPnC group).  The  most  frequently  reported  systemic  events  were  increased  sleep  (26.3%  [n=10])  and irritability  (18.4%  [n=7])  in  the  7vPnC/13vPnC  group,  and  increased  sleep  (33.3%  [n=12])  and decreased  appetite  (16.7%  [n=6])  in  the  MnCC/13vPnC  group.  Most  subjects  did  not  report  fever. Fever was reported in 1 (2.9%) subject in the 7vPnC/13vPnC group only; this was mild (≥38°C but ≤39°C) in severity. Overall, most subjects did not receive antipyretic medication to treat or prevent symptoms. Medication was used to treat symptoms in 3 (7.9%) subjects in the 7vPnC/13vPnC group only; no subjects in the MnCC/13vPnC group used medication to treat symptoms. None of the subjects in either group used medication to prevent symptoms.

## Adverse Events

At  least  1  AE  was  reported  in  57.9%  (n=22)  of  subjects  in  the  7vPnC/13vPnC  group  and  55.6% (n=20) of subjects in the MnCC/13vPnC group. Nearly all AEs reported were characterized as mild or moderate in severity; 1 AE (increased sleep) was assessed as severe. This event started on day 2 as moderate, then severe on day 3, and mild on days 4 to 6. In the 7vPnC/13vPnC group, the system organ  classes most  frequently  reported  were  'general  and  administration  site disorders'  and 'respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders'  (each  21.1%,  n=8)  whereas  in  the  MnCC/13vPnC group,  'injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications'  and  'nervous  system  disorders'  were  most frequently reported (22.2%, n=8 and 16.7%, n=6, respectively).

##  MAH's conclusions

A  single  dose  of  13vPnC  was  immunogenic  in  children  aged  11  to  14  years,  regardless  of  previous vaccination with 7vPnC or MnCC.

A subsequent childhood dose of 13vPnC showed a satisfactory safety and tolerability profile in subjects who were vaccinated with a primary series of 7vPnC or MnCC.

The  data  presented  here  add  to  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  database  for  this  vaccine  in  older children, and do not change the risk-benefit assessment for Prevenar 13.

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The current study presents results of a single dose of Prevenar 13 in subjects 11-14 years of age who received either  Prevenar  or  a  MnCC  vaccine  as  infants.  The  results  show  that  the  vaccine  is  clearly immunogenic  in  both  groups,  and  there  were  no  major  difference  between  the  groups.  The  study population, healthy children 11-14 years, is not currently included in the indication for Prevenar 13,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

but  is  generally  not  considered  a  risk  group  for  pneumococcal  infections,  and  therefore  is  not considered to benefit from vaccination. No safety  issues were detected in this study.  However, two questions regarding the lack of difference between the immune responses between the two groups are raised that needs clarification before the procedure can be considered fulfilled.

## III. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

##  Overall conclusion

The data provided indicate that the vaccine is clearly immunogenic in both groups, but , two questions regarding the lack of difference between the immune responses between the two groups are raised that needs clarification before the procedure can be considered fulfilled.

##  Recommendation

## Fulfilled:

No further action required

## Not fulfilled: X

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide responses to the questions below as part of this procedure P46 042. (see section IV 'Additional clarifications requested').

## IV. ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS REQUESTED

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide responses to the questions below as part of this procedure P46 041.

Question 1: With regard to the pre-challenge serological data: From the supportive tables (Section 15, tables 12/15, 23/25, 41/43) it appears that OPA antibody titres and GMTs are very similar between both groups on visit 1 (prior to vaccination), except for serotypes 6B, 18C and 23F. For the latter three the 7vPnC group consistently shows better protective values. The company is asked to comment on this and on the fact that there is no apparent difference in protection between groups with regard to the serotypes 4, 9V, 14 and 19F.

Question 2: There appears very little difference in quality and quantity of the immune response upon vaccination of both groups with Prevenar 13. The company is asked to comment on the apparent lack of anamnestic response, with regard to the 7vPnC serotypes, upon vaccination of the 7vPnC group with Prevenar 13.

The timetable as proposed by the Rapporteur is as follows:

a 30 day response timetable without clock stop will apply.
