## Introduction

On 22 March 2016, the MAH submitted the final study report of study DTPa-HBV-IPV-119 for Infanrix hexa, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study 111157 (DTPa-HBV-IPV-119) is a standalone study. The main objective of the study was to determine the safety and immunogenicity of Infanrix hexa when administered to Indian infants according to a 6-10-14 weeks of age and a 2-4-6 months of age schedule, in rder to support the marketing authorization application of Infanrix hexa in India.

The current standard of care in India recommends

- -At birth: vaccination against tuberculosis (BCG), poliomyelitis (OPV), hepatitis B
- -At 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age: Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTPw), poliomyelitis (OPV and IPV), Hib
- -At 6 and 14 weeks of age: hepatitis B

The highest valent combination vaccines currently available in India are the 5-valent vaccines: DTPwHBV-Hib and DTPa-IPV/Hib.

A first study has confirmed the safety profile of the vaccine in Indian infants [104005 (DTPa-HBV-IPV106)]. The present study was performed to establish the immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine in Indian infants.

## 1.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

All subjects received three doses of Infanrix hexa (Lot Numbers AC21B293A and AHIBC456D).

## 1.3. Clinical aspects

## 1.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Study 111157 (DTPa-HBV-IPV-119), a phase III, open-label, randomised, multicentre study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the combined DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine (Infanrix hexa) administered to Indian infants according to a 6-10-14 weeks of age or a 2-4-6 months of age schedule.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1.3.2. Clinical study

Study 111157 (DTPa-HBV-IPV-119), a phase III, open-label, randomised, multicentre study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the combined DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine (Infanrix hexa) administered to Indian infants according to a 6-10-14 weeks of age or a 24-6 months of age schedule.

## Description

This was a phase III, open-label, randomised, multicentre study in India with two groups (N=112 per group), with all subjects receiving three dose of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine. Two blood samples were collected, one (2 mL) before the administration of the first dose and a second sample (5 mL) approximately one month after the third dose. Safety data was collected up to 30 days after administration of the study vaccine.

The first subject was enrolled in the study on 16 April 2012 and the last study visit was on 25 February 2013. The data lock point was 4 December 2015.

## Methods

## Objectives

## Primary objective

Immunogenicity

- -To assess the immunological response to the study vaccine in terms of seroprotection status for diphtheria, tetanus, polio, hepatitis B and Hib antigens, and in terms of vaccine response for the pertussis antigens, one month after the third dose of the primary vaccination.

## Secondary objective

## Immunogenicity

- -To assess the immunological response to the study vaccine in terms of seroprotection/seropositivity status and antibody concentrations or titres for all antigens, one month after the third dose of the primary vaccination.
- -To assess the immunological status towards hepatitis B, pertussis and polio antigens in terms of antibody concentrations, before the first dose of the primary vaccination.

Safety

- -To assess the safety and reactogenicity of the study vaccine in terms of solicited and unsolicited, local and general symptoms and serious adverse events.

## Study design

Phase III, open-label, non-randomised, multicentre study in India with two groups and all subjects receiving three doses of hexavalent vaccine. Collection of blood samples before dose 1 and one month post dose 3.

- -Evidence of previous diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and Hib vaccination or disease, with the exception of a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and OPV as per local standard of care.
- -Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).
- -Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.
- -History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine.
- -Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness.
- -Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned administration during the study period.
- -Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever was defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C/99.5°F on oral, axillary or tympanic setting, or ≥ 38.0 ° C/100.4 ° F on rectal setting. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study was oral/axillary.
- -Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may have be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.

## Sample size

A total of 224 subjects were vaccinated and 223 subjects completed the study and were therefore included in the ATP cohort for safety. Twelve subjects were excluded and therefore 211 subjects were included in the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity.

The target sample size was 200 subjects (100 subjects per group) evaluable for immunogenicity. Considering that approximately 10% of enrolled subjects might withdraw or may not be evaluable for immunogenicity, the number of subjects enrolled was 224 subjects (112 subjects per group).

- -2-4-6 group: Subjects in this group received Infanrix hexa at 2-4-6 months of age.

## Endpoints

All analyses are descriptive.

## Primary endpoint

## Immunogenicity

-  Anti-diphtheria, anti-tetanus, anti-HBs, anti-poliovirus type 1, anti-poliovirus type 2, antipoliovirus type 3 and anti-PRP seroprotection status , one month after the third dose of primary vaccination.
-  Vaccine response to PT, FHA and PRN, one month after the third dose of primary vaccination.

## Secondary endpoint

-  Anti-diphtheria, anti-tetanus, anti-HBs, anti-poliovirus type 1, anti-poliovirus type 2, antipoliovirus type 3, anti-PRP, anti-PT, anti-FHA, anti-PRN antibody concentrations or titres, one month after the third dose of primary vaccination.
-  Anti-PT, anti-FHA, anti-PRN antibody seropositivity status, one month after the third dose of primary vaccination.
-  Anti-poliovirus type 1, anti-poliovirus type 2, anti-poliovirus type 3, anti-PT, anti-FHA, anti-PRN and anti-HBs antibody titres or concentrations and seropositivity/seroprotection status, before the first dose of primary vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety

-  Solicited local and general symptoms : Occurrence of solicited local/general symptoms during the 4-day (Day 0-Day 3) follow-up period after each vaccination.
-  Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs) : Occurrence of unsolicited symptoms during the 31-day (Day 0-Day 30) followup period after each vaccination.
-  SAEs : Occurrence of SAEs from Dose 1 up to study end.

## Exploratory analyses

As per the request of the regulatory authorities in India, the initial study protocol was amended to include also two subgroup analyses:

- A subgroup analysis of seropositivity rates, seroprotection rates with exact 95% CI and GMC with 95% CI for hepatitis B antigen, before the first dose of primary vaccination was performed based on the hepatitis B status of the mother. However, since none of the mothers reported a hepatitis B infection, this subgroup analysis was not performed.
- A subgroup analysis of seroprotection rates with exact 95%CI and GMT with 95% CI for all three poliovirus types, before the first dose of primary vaccination was performed based on the number of OPV birth doses.

These analyses were performed for information only. In case the numbers of subjects in each subgroup were insufficient, the information was to be provided in the form of an individual data listing in the clinical study report.

The results of the exploratory group comparisons were to be interpreted with caution considering that there was no adjustment for multiplicity for these comparisons and that the clinical relevance of any differences was not accounted for in the planning of the exploratory analyses.

## Statistical Methods

## ATP cohort for analysis of safety

All vaccinated subjects:

-  who had received at least one dose of study vaccine according to their random assignment
-  for whom administration route and site of study vaccine was known and according to the protocol and
-  who have not received a vaccine not specified or forbidden in the protocol.

## ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity

All subjects from the ATP cohort for analysis of safety:

-  who met all eligibility criteria
-  who complied with the procedures and intervals defined in the protocol
-  who did not meet any of the elimination criteria during the study
-  who did not receive a product leading to exclusion from an ATP analysis
-  who did not present with a medical condition leading to exclusion from an ATP analysis
-  for whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures were available. This included subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vaccine antigen component after vaccination. The interval between Visit 3 and Visit 4, considered for inclusion of a subject was 21-48 days.

## Derived and transformed data

-  A seronegative subject was a subject whose antibody concentration/titre was below the assay cut-off.
-  A seropositive subject was a subject whose antibody concentration/titre was greater than or equal to the assay cut-off.
-  A seroprotected subject was a subject whose antibody concentration/titre was greater than or equal to the level defining clinical protection. The following seroprotection thresholds are applicable:
- o Anti-diphtheria antibody concentrations ≥0.1 IU/ml.
- o Anti-tetanus antibody concentrations ≥0.1 IU/ml.
- o Anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥10 mIU/ml.
- o Anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 antibody titres ≥8.
- o Anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥0.15 μg/ml.

## Other cut-offs were considered:

- o Anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥1.0 μg/ml.
- o Anti-diphtheria antibody concentrations ≥1.0IU/ml.
- o Anti-tetanus antibody concentrations ≥1.0 IU/ml.
- o Anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥100 mIU/ml.
-  Vaccine response to PT, FHA and PRN, was defined as appearance of antibodies in subjects who were initially seronegative (i.e. with concentrations &lt; cut-off value) or at least maintenance of pre-vaccination antibody concentrations in subjects who were initially seropositive (i.e. with concentrations ≥ cut-off value), taking into consideration the decreasing maternal antibodies.
-  The geometric mean titres ( GMT ) /geometric mean concentrations ( GMC ) calculations were performed by taking the anti-log of the mean of the log10 titre/concentration transformations. Antibody titres/concentrations below the cut-off of the assay were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMT/GMC calculation. For anti-HBs GMC calculation, as per CLIA assay specification, results between 6.2 mIU/ml (assay cut-off) and 7.65 mIU/ml [Lower Limit of quantification (LLOQ)] were quantified as 6.2 mIU/ml only.

Seropositivity rates and geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN by groups before first dose of vaccination and one month after third dose of vaccination are given below:

- -Before first dose of vaccination the seropositivity rates for anti-PT antibody was reported for 41.9% of subjects and 35.6% of subjects in 6-10-14 group and 2-4-6 group respectively. One month after the third dose of vaccination all subjects in both the groups were reported to be seropositive against anti-PT antibody. The GMC values ranged between 5.0 EU/ml and 4.6 EU/ml before first dose of vaccination and between 107.3 EU/ml and 108.2 EU/ml one month after the third dose of vaccination across two groups.
- -Before first dose of vaccination the seropositivity rates for anti-FHA was reported for 88.1% of subjects and 88.2% of subjects in 6-10-14 group and 2-4-6 group respectively. One month after the third dose of vaccination all subjects reported to be seropositive against anti-FHA antibody in both the groups. The GMC value ranged between 18.7 EU/ml and 20.1 EU/ml before first dose of vaccination and one month after the third dose vaccination across two groups.
- -Before first dose of vaccination the seropositivity rates for anti-PRN was reported for 18.1% of subjects and 14.4% of subjects in 6-10-14 group and 2-4-6 group respectively. One month after third dose of vaccination all subjects reported to be seropositive against anti-PRN antibody in both the groups. The GMC value ranged between 3.4 EU/ml and 3.2 EU/ml before first dose of vaccination and one month after the third dose of vaccination across two groups.
- -The levels of pertussis antibodies observed at the pre-vaccination time-point are probably due to the natural exposure to the disease or maternal transfer of antibodies against pertussis.

## Conclusion

Although no formal comparison was made between the two groups, the immunogenicity and safety results are comparable between the 6-10-12 weeks and 2-4-6 months schedule.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The results of the 2-4-6 months schedule were also comparable with study DTPa-HBV-IPV-070, an open clinical study conducted in Spain in 2000-2001 to assess the immunogenicity and safety of Infanrix hexa as a primary vaccination course to pre-term infants (&lt; 37 weeks) at 2, 4 and 6 months of age in comparison with infants born after normal gestation period ( ≥ 37 weeks), see table below:

<!-- image -->

Although no formal comparison was made between the two studies, seroprotection/seropositivity rates and GMT/GMC were higher in the present study compared to immunogenicity data obtained in Spain in the 2-4-6 month schedule (study DTPa-HBV-IPV-070) with overlapping or superior 95%CI, except for the diphteria component.

The antibody levels of the diphteria component in the present study were somewhat lower compared to the data obtained in full-term babies in study DTPa-HBV-IPV-070: GMC of 2.334 (95%CI: 2.049; 2.659) and 3.726 (95%CI: 3.260; 4.258) in the 6-10-14 weeks and 2-4-6 months schedule, resp.

In conclusion, one month post-dose3,

- -All subjects in both groups were seroprotected against diphtheria and tetanus antigens.
- -All subjects in 6-10-14 group and 99% of subjects in 2-4-6 group were seroprotected against hepatitis B.
- -All the subjects in both the groups were seroprotected against poliovirus types 1 and 2. All subjects in 2-4-6 group and 98.6% of subjects in 6-10-14 group were seroprotected against poliovirus type 3.
- -All except one subject in each group were seroprotected against PRP antigen .
- -The vaccine response to anti-PRN antibodies was reported in 99% of the subjects in both groups.
- -All subjects in 6-10-14 group and 99% of subjects in 2-4-6 group showed vaccine response to anti-PT antibodies. Similarly, 97% of subjects in 6-10-14 group and 98% of subjects in 2-4-6 group showed vaccine response to anti-FHA antibodies.

## CHMP comment

The generated immunogenicity data are consistent with previous data of Infanrix hexa as priming vaccine for DTPa-IPV-Hib and booster vaccine for HepB.

## Safety results

## · Solicited local and general adverse events

During the 4-day follow-up period, pain was the most frequently reported solicited local symptom, reported for 25.2% of subjects in 6-10-14 group and 13.4% of subjects in 2-4-6 group. Pain was also the most frequently reported Grade 3 solicited local symptom, reported for 1.8% and 0.9% of subjects in 6-10-14 and 2-4-6 groups, respectively. Grade 2 for Pain means moderate pain, i.e. the subject cries/protests on touch. Grade 3 For Pain means severe pain, i.e. the subjects cries when limb is moved/spontaneously painful.

Fever was the most frequently reported solicited general symptom, reported for 15.3% and 15.2% of subjects in 6-10-14 and 2-4-6 group. It was also the most frequently reported Grade 3 solicited general symptom in 0.9% of subjects in 2-4-6 group. None of subjects in 6-10-14 group reported fever of Grade 3 intensity. None of the subjects in 6-10-14 group and 0.9% of the subjects in 2-4-6 group reported solicited general symptoms related to vaccination.

## · Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs)

During the 31 day (Day 0-30) post vaccination period:

- -At least one unsolicited symptom was reported for 35.7% and 22.3% of subjects in 6-10-14 and 2-4-6 group, respectively.
- -The most frequently reported unsolicited symptom was upper respiratory tract infection reported for 16.1% and 9.8% of subjects in 6-10-14 and 2-4-6 group,
- -respectively.
- -None of the subjects reported Grade 3 unsolicited symptoms. None of the unsolicited symptoms were assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.
- SAEs

No fatal events were reported in this study.

Overall five subjects reported at least one symptom in occurrence of SAEs in both the groups (two subjects in 6-10-14 group and three subjects in 2-4-6 group). Bronchiolitis and pneumonia were reported for two subjects each in 6-10-14 group and one subject in 2-4-6 group. Lower respiratory tract infection was reported for two subjects in 2-4-6 group.

All the SAEs resolved during the study period.

No AEs leading to premature discontinuation of the study vaccine and/or study were reported.

In conclusion, during the 31 day (Day 0-30) post vaccination period, at least one unsolicited symptom was reported for 35.7% of subjects in 6-10-14 group and 22.3% of subjects in 2-4-6 group. A total of five subjects (two subjects in 6-10-14 group and three subjects in 2-4-6 group) reported SAEs during the study period. None of the SAEs were causally related to the vaccine in both the groups and resolved during the study period. None of the subjects were withdrawn the study due to a SAE.

## CHMP comment

The generated safety data are consistent with previous data on Infanrix hexa.

## 1.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

A limitation of the current study is the potential bias due to the open-label design.

The study investigated the immunogenicity and safety of Infanrix hexa in 224 healthy infants in India who were vaccinated at birth with BCG and HepB vaccine, in two schedules, the standard of care schedule of 6-10-14 weeks (EPI schedule) and the 2-4-6 months schedule adopted by countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States, as well as neighboring countries such as Thailand and Sri Lanka.

One month post primary vaccination, the seroprotection status for diphtheria, tetanus, polio, hepatitis B and Hib antigens ranged from 98.6% to 100% in the two study groups. The vaccine response to the pertussis antigens ranged from 97% to 100% in the two study groups.

The vaccine was considered to be safe and generally well-tolerated. SAEs (pneumonia and bronchiolitis) were reported for two subjects in 6-10-14 group and pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infection were reported for three subjects in 2-4-6 group during the study period. All SAEs were resolved by the end of the study. None of the SAEs were considered by the investigator as causally related. Fever was the most frequently reported solicited general symptom reported for 15.3% and 15.2% of subjects in 6-10-14 and 2-4-6 group. Fever was also the most frequently reported Grade 3 solicited general symptom, reported for 0.9% of subjects in both the groups. Only one subject from 24-6 group showed temperature &gt;39.0°C.
