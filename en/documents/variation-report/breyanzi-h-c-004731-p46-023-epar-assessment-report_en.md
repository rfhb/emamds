## 1. Introduction

On August 19, 2024, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study (study JCAR017-BCM-004) for Breyanzi (liso-cel), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The  MAH  stated  that  clinical  study  JCAR017-BCM-004  was  part  of  a  clinical  development  program. JCAR017-BCM-004 (hereafter, BCM-004) was a Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH)'s sponsored Phase 1/2, single arm trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of Breyanzi (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel) in  paedia tric  subjects  (&lt;18  years  old  and  weight  ≥  6  kg)  with  relapsed/refractory  (r/r) B-cell  acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) and B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL).

Following the latest application for a modification to the agreed liso-cel paediatric investigation plan (PIP, decision EMEA-001995-PIP01-16-M04 dated 27 October 2023), a product specific waiver in accordance with Article 11(1)(c) of said Regulation was granted, on the grounds that the specific medicinal product did not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for paediatric patients. The waiver covered all subsets of the paediatric population in the following two conditions:

- Treatment of B-lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma
- Treatment of mature B-cell neoplasms

Consequently, Study BCM-004 was early terminated on 26 January 2024.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Liso-cel  is  a  T-cell  immunotherapy  comprising  autologous  CD4+  and  CD8+  T  cells  that  have  been transduced using a replication-incompetent, self-inactivating lentiviral vector encoding a CD19-specific CAR.

Each  liso-cel  dose  consisted  of  a  single  infusion  of  two  individually  formulated  CD4+CAR+  and CD8+CAR+ T cell suspensions administered separately in a 1:1 ratio in a formulation containing DMSO.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Study JCAR017-BCM-004

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study JCAR017-BCM-004 - A Phase 1/2, Open-Label, Single Arm, Multicohort, Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of JCAR017 in Pediatric Subjects with Relapsed/Refractory B-ALL And B-NHL (Transcend Pedall)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Description

Study JCAR017-BCM-004 (hereafter referred to as BCM-004) was a Phase 1/2, open-label, single arm, multicohort, multicentre trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of liso-cel in paediatric subjects with r/r B-ALL and r/r B-NHL.

BCM-004  was  originally  included  in  the  agreed  liso-cel  PIP  (EMEA-001995-PIP01-16;  original  EMA decision P/0278/2017, dated 04-Oct-2017).

The study design is summarised in Figures below:

Figure 1. study design BCM-004

The study was composed of the following 3 treatment periods:

## Pre-Treatment Period :

- -Screening:  study-specified  screening  assessments  were  performed  within  14  days  prior  to enrolment.
- -Leukapheresis and liso-cel product generation (approximately 5 weeks prior to liso-cel infusion): an unstimulated leukapheresis collection was performed on each subject to obtain a sufficient quantity of PBMCs for the production of the liso-cel investigational product.

Treatment Period (LD chemotherapy to Day 56):

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -LD chemotherapy: LD chemotherapy was initiated and completed 2 to 7 days before liso-cel infusion.
- -Liso-cel  administration:  infused  on  Day  1.  The  first  response  evaluation  was  performed  at approximately 28 days after liso-cel infusion.

## Post-treatment Follow-up Period (after Day 56 to EOS):

Subjects were followed at approximately 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months (EOS) for PD/relapse, safety, CAR+ T cell persistence, second primary malignancies, and survival after administration of liso-cel unless the subject was lost to follow-up. All subjects who either completed the post-treatment follow-up period specified in this protocol or who prematurely withdrew after liso-cel infusion were asked to enrol in the separate LTFU protocol (GC-LTFU-001) for up to 15 years at the EOS visit or at the time of withdrawal, respectively.

## Methods

## Study participants

## Main inclusion/exclusion criteria

Eligible subjects in the Phase 1 part of study BCM-004 were male and female patients who were ≤18 years of age (weight ≥ 6 kg ) with evidence of CD19 expression via flow cytometry (peripheral blood or bone  marrow)  or  immunohistochemistry  (bone  marrow  biopsy)  and  diagnosis  of  B-ALL  (defined  as morphological evidence of disease in BM [5% or greater lymphoblast by morphology]) and one of the following:

- -first or greater marrow relapse, or
- -any marrow relapse after allogeneic HSCT, or
- -primary refractory (defined as not achieving a CR or a CRi after 2 or more separate induction regimens),  or  chemo-refractory  (defined  as  not  achieving  CR/CRi  after  1  cycle  of  standard chemotherapy for relapsed leukemia), or
- -ineligible for allogeneic HSCT

B-ALL subjects meeting the above definition were included regardless of MRD status.

Subjects must have exhibited a Karnofsky score of ≥50 (for ≥16 years of age) or a Lansky score of ≥50 (for &lt;16 years of age).

Subjects with CNS-2 or CNS-3 involvement were eligible if they were asymptomatic and did not have significant neurological disorder per investigator assessment.

Subjects with prior CAR T cell (or other genetically-modified T cell therapy), previous history of or active HBV, HCV or HIV infection, uncontrolled systemic fungal, bacterial, viral infection, acute or chronic graftversus-host disease (GVHD), active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) within 3 months prior to leukapheresis, cardiac disorders (CTCAE version 4.03 Grade 3 or 4) within the past 6 months or history/presence of clinically relevant CNS pathology such as epilepsy, seizure, paresis, aphasia, stroke, cerebral oedema, severe brain injuries, dementia, Parkinson's disease, cerebellar disease, organic brain syndrome, or psychosis, were excluded from study BCM-004.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

At the Investigator's discretion, subjects might have received a single cycle of anticancer treatment (ie, bridging chemotherapy) and/or supportive care for disease control while the liso-cel cell product was being manufactured. Chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy given after leukapheresis was stopped ≥7 days prior to lymphodepletion (LD) chemotherapy.

Subjects were treated for 3 days with fludarabine IV (30 mg/m 2 /day) and cyclophosphamide IV (300 mg/m 2 /day) prior to liso-cel infusion: LD chemotherapy was initiated and completed 2 to 7 days before liso-cel infusion (if any AEs occurred due to LD chemotherapy, liso-cel infusion was delayed for up to 14 days after LD chemotherapy upon discussion with the Investigator).

Per  protocol,  subjects  should  have  been  premedicated  with  paracetamol/acetaminophen 12.5 mg/kg (maximum dose of 650 mg) by PO or IV at an equivalent dose and diphenhydramine hydrochloride 1 mg/kg (maximum dose 50 mg) PO or IV 30 to 60 minutes prior to liso-cel infusion.

Liso-cel  was  given  on  Day  1:  each  liso-cel  dose  consisted  of  a  single  infusion  of  two  individually formulated CD4+CAR+ and CD8+CAR+ T cell suspensions administered separately in a 1:1 ratio in a formulation containing DMSO.

The initial starting dose of 0.50 x 10 6  CAR+ T cells/kg (maximum dose of 50 x 10 6  liso-cel CAR+ T cells [non-weight adjusted]) in BCM-004 was established following the experience of the PLAT-02 study using SCRI-CAR19v1 (Gardner, 2017). However, an AE/DLT (Grade 4 neurotoxicity) was observed in the first r/r B-ALL paediatric subject treated under the original Protocol (dated 29-Mar-2018) and prompted the MAH to re-evaluate the dosing strategy. A lower starting dose was then identified and the protocol was amended (Protocol Amendment 2, dated 10-Sep-2019) to modify the dosing strategy and reduce the starting dose 10-fold to 0.05 x 10 6  CAR+ T cells/kg (maximum dose of 5 x 10 6  liso-cel CAR+ T cells [non-weight adjusted]).

Up to 5 dose levels of liso-cel were planned to be evaluated (see Table below).

Table 1. Dose escalation scheme for BCM-004, according to protocol amendment 2

At DL1 (0.05x10 6  CAR+T cells/kg), a one-time retreatment with intra-patient dose escalation to 0.10 x 10 6  CAR+T cells/kg (maximum dose of 10 x 10 6  liso-cel CAR+ T cells) was allowed for subjects treated at DL1 who had not experienced severe toxicity and did not have a response on Day 28 after liso-cel infusion. Subjects that were re-treated received a cumulative liso-cel dose of 0.15 x 10 6  CAR+ T cells equivalent to DL2. However, data from subjects retreated as part of intra-patient dose escalation were not included in the mTPI-2 algorithm to estimate DLT rates at DL2.

During the study, not all planned dose levels were explored. Subjects were only treated under dose levels 1, 2 and 4. A RP2D could not be established based on the tolerability and preliminary efficacy in the DLT evaluable subjects treated in Phase 1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Objective(s)

The protocol-specified objectives for safety/efficacy include the following:

Primary objective (Phase 1):

- -To identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in paediatric subjects with r/r B-ALL

Secondary objectives (Phase 1 and 2):

- -To evaluate the feasibility of manufacturing liso-cel
- -To evaluate ORR in the non-selected dose levels from Phase 1
- -To evaluate safety and tolerability assessments during 24 months after liso-cel infusion
- -To further evaluate efficacy by assessing the DOR, RFS, EFS, BOR, and OS during 24 months after liso-cel infusion
- -To evaluate the percentage of r/r B-ALL subjects who achieve CR or CRi with no MRD detected in BM (below the level of detection [&lt;0.01%] by a validated assay) assessed during 24 months after liso-cel infusion
- -To assess the percentage of subjects who achieve a response after liso-cel infusion and then proceed to HSCT

## Outcomes/endpoints

Recommended Phase 2 Dose (Primary Endpoint): The Phase 1 portion of the study utilized the mTPI-2 algorithm to identify a safe and tolerable dose in paediatric subjects.

Efficacy (Secondary Endpoints): efficacy data were assessed by the Investigator using the 2019 NCCN response criteria guidelines for paediatric ALL. Efficacy endpoints included:

- -Best overall response (BOR)
- -Objective response rate (ORR, i.e. the proportion of subjects who achieved either CR/CRi on Day 28 that is confirmed on Day 56, divided by the number of subjects included in the analysis)
- -DOR (the duration from initial CR/CRi to documented PD, relapsed disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first)
- -RFS (time from conforming liso-cel infusion to the first PD, relapsed disease or death from any cause, whichever occurs first)
- -EFS  (time  from  liso-cel  infusion  to  PD,  relapsed  disease,  start  of  a  new  anticancer  therapy including HSCT or death from any cause, whichever occurs first)
- -OS (interval from the date of first liso-cel infusion to the date of from any cause)

Pharmacodynamics: B-cell aplasia, resulting from anti-CD19 CAR+ T cell therapy, was used as a PD biomarker for on-target functional assessment of liso-cel treatment in subjects. B-cell aplasia assessment in peripheral blood samples was made by a flow cytometry assay, which used an antibody against CD19 for B-cell identification. B-cell aplasia was defined as &lt;1 CD19+ cell per microliter of whole blood.

Persistence of Vector Sequence (PVS) Monitoring: subjects treated with liso-cel were tested at 6-month intervals, at 12 months or any time after 12 months post-infusion for persistence of vector sequence in peripheral blood. Test results generated by ddPCR were reported as percentage (%) of total nucleated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

blood cells containing vector sequence in whole blood. If vector sequence was detected in ≥1% of total nucleated blood cells at anytime ≥12 months post -treatment, ISA would be performed to assess clonality for any potential risk of clonal outgrowth or insertion oncogenesis.

Replication-competent Lentivirus (RCL) Testing: RCL was assessed using qPCR on genomic DNA obtained from peripheral blood samples.

## Sample size

This study planned to enrol and treat approximately 101 total paediatric subjects (up to 30 in Phase 1 (r/r B-ALL only) and up to 71 additional subjects in Phase 2 (r/r B-ALL and B-NHL)) assuming all dose levels and cohorts enrolled the maximum number of subjects and no subjects would be replaced.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

N/A. BCM-004 was an open-label, uncontrolled study.

## Statistical Methods

The  protocol  was  amended  twice  throughout  the  study.  The  study  was  initiated  under  the  Original Protocol, dated 29-Mar-2018. Protocol Amendment 1 (dated 07-Jan-2019) was implemented to amend inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  following  an  Urgent  Safety  Measure  on  another  liso-cel  clinical  trial. Protocol Amendment 2 (dated 10-Sep-2019) was implemented to amend the initial starting dose of lisocel and Phase 1 study design.

A Safety Review Committee (SRC), composed of the medical monitor, drug safety physician, statistician and up to 5 active Investigators, reviewed DLTs in Phase 1, and provided recommendations for dose escalation  and  de-escalation  based  on  assessment  of  the  safety,  PK  data  and  preliminary  efficacy information.  An  independent  Data  Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB),  composed  of  a  statistician  and selected physicians with experience in haematology/oncology and/or T cell therapy, reviewed cumulative study data over the course of the study to evaluate safety, protocol conduct, and scientific validity and integrity of the trial.

Liso-cel dose escalation/de-escalation followed an mTPI-2 algorithm. The decision to open a dose level for enrolment was made by the sponsor and informed by the SRC following review of safety, PK data and preliminary efficacy for subjects treated at each dose.

A dose level was considered unsafe if it had an estimated 95% or more probability of exceeding the target DLT rate of 30% (i.e., P (DLT &gt; 30%|data) &gt;95%) with at least 3 paediatric subjects treated at that dose level. A dose level was considered safe, if at least 3 DLT evaluable paediatric subjects completed the DLT period, and the DLT rate of 30% was not exceeded.

DLTs  were  defined  as:  Death  not  related  to  disease  progression;  Grade  4  neurotoxicity;  Grade  3 neurotoxicity of greater than 7 days' duration; Grade 3 neurotoxicity not reverting to baseline within 28 days of the start date of the Grade 3 Event; Seizures of any grade not resolving within 7 days; Grade 4 CRS not resolving to Grade ≤ 3 within 3 days ; Grade 3 CRS not resolving to Grade ≤ 2 within 7 days ; any increase in AST or ALT &gt; 3 × ULN and concurrent increase in total bilirubin &gt;2 × ULN unrelated to CRS that has no other probable reason; Any cardiac, dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hepatic, pulmonary, renal/genitourinary,  or  neurologic  Grade  3  or  4  event  not  pre-existing  or  not  due  to  the  underlying malignancy; Any other Grade 3 or 4 event deemed unexpected by the Investigator and considered a DLT upon evaluation by the SRC.

The DLT Analysis Population included all Phase 1 enrolled subjects who received a liso-cel infusion and completed 28 days post liso-cel infusion, the DLT assessment period, if having not been observed as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

having a DLT before this point. Subjects who received a nonconforming product were not included in the DLT Analysis Population.

The Efficacy Analysis Population included all subjects who fulfilled all study eligibility criteria and received liso-cel infusion in accordance with drug product release specifications (i.e.., conforming liso-cel product). Subjects  who  received  a  nonconforming  liso-cel  product  were  not  included  in  the  Efficacy  Analysis Population.  B-ALL  subjects  who  demonstrated  morphological  remission  at  screening  and  were  MRD negative upon restaging prior to initiation of LD chemotherapy (i.e., no baseline disease) were treated and followed on study but were not considered evaluable for the EAP.

The Safety Analysis Population included all subjects who have received an infusion of liso-cel cell product. Subjects who received a nonconforming product were not included in the Safety Analysis Population.

Endpoints that were rate/proportion based were reported as the number of subjects eligible for a given analysis along with the rate (percentage) and corresponding Clopper-Pearson 95% CI, while time-toevent data were analysed by Kaplan-Meier curves and the proportion of subjects remaining event free at given time points was presented along with the median time. Greenwood 95% CIs were also derived.

Study  BCM-004 was conducted in accordance with the principles  of  Good  Clinical  Practice  (GCP)  as defined by the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) and was conducted to meet the ethical requirements of European Directive 2001/20/EC.

Of the 14 subjects who received liso-cel, 1 (6.3%) subject received a retreatment with liso-cel according to the intra-patient dose-escalation schema for DL1 in accordance with Protocol Amendment 2, and 11 subjects met the criteria to be included in the Efficacy Analysis population.

Of the 24 r/r B-ALL subjects screened, 13 (54.2%) subjects died from the time of informed consent and end of study. Twelve (50%) subjects died due to progression of their r/r B-ALL, 1 (4.2%) subject died due to an adverse event (respiratory insufficiency due to pulmonary haemorrhage) on Study Day 271 following  complications  post-HSCT.  Of  the  13  subjects  who  died,  5  (20.8%)  subjects  died  due  to progression of their r/r B-ALL prior to receiving liso-cel.

## Recruitment

A total of 18 sites across 6 countries were activated on study BCM-005, of which 6 sites across 4 countries enrolled subjects.

## Baseline data

Demographic and disease characteristics at baseline are summarised in Table below:

## Number analysed

A total of 16 (76.2%) subjects received at least one dose of LDC. Out of the 16 subjects who received at  least  one  dose  of  LDC,  14  (87.5%)  subjects  received  liso-cel,  1  (6.3%)  subject  received  nonconforming product and 1 (6.3%) subject was not infused due to AEs (leukopenia and neutropenic fever) and disease progression during the administration of LDC.

Of the 14 subjects who received liso-cel, 1 (6.3%) subject received a retreatment with liso-cel according to the intra-patient dose-escalation schema for DL1 in accordance with Protocol Amendment 2, and 11 subjects met the criteria to be included in the Efficacy Analysis population.

## Efficacy results

Objective  remission  rate  (ORR),  duration  of  response  (DoR)  and  minimal  residual  disease  (MRD) negativity rate

In the Efficacy Analysis population (EAP N=11), ORR was observed in 5 (45.5%) subjects (95%CI: 16.7, 76.6) and consisted of CRi only, with no CRs observed. Median DOR was 13.7 months (95% CI: NA, NA) and 3 (27.3%) subjects who achieved a CRi in the EAP also achieved MRD-negative response with 95% CI (6.0, 61.0) (see Tables below).

Response is assessed per the NCCN Response Cntena Guidelines for pedatnc ALL (NCCN, 2019)

ORR is defined as the proportion of sobjects who achieved either a CR or CRi on Day 28 that is confimmed on Day 56, divided by the mumber of subject included in the analysis

CRR is the proportion of subjects who achieved a BOR of CR. CRis defined as CR on Day 28 that is confirmed on Day 56.

Disease assessments recorded on or after start ofa new anti-cancer therapy incloding HsCT. will not be considered. nor will disease assessments reported after a PD or relapse has been observed

The 95h confidence interval could not be estimated due to lack of data variability

One (9.1%) subject did not achieve a response at Day 28 and had a best response of relapsed disease and  was  re-treated  with  liso-cel  per  the  intra-patient  dose-escalation  schema.  No  subjects  had documented best response of refractory disease or PD. Five (45.5%) subjects were considered to have a BOR of 'Not Applicable' because they did not have efficacy assessments performed per protocol (3 subjects discontinued from the study prior Day 28 and 2 subjects did not have disease assessments confirmed at Day 56).

Non-responders  generally  exhibited  low  expansion  of  both  CD8+  EGFRt+  and  CD4+  EGFRt+  cells. Responders exhibited expansion of CD8+ EGFRt+ cells. Limited expansion of CD4+ EGFRt+ cells was observed in both responders and non-responders.

Relapse-free survival (RFS), Event-free survival (EFS) and Overall survival (OS)

The Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates for the median for RFS was 8.97 months (95% CI: 0.79, NA), EFS was 4.99 months (95% CI: 0.79, 8.97), and for OS was 8.90 months (95% CI: 0.92, NA) (see Table below).

Allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) rate

Of  the  14  subjects  received  liso-cel,  5  (35.7%)  who  achieved  a  CR/CRi  post  liso-cel  proceeded  to allogeneic HSCT:

- -In DL1: 2 (14.3%) subjects proceeded to HSCT after liso-cel (174 and 598 days after liso-cel, respectively); 1 subject had a best response post-HSCT of relapsed disease and 1 subject had a best response post-HSCT of CRi.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -In DL2: 2 (14.3%) subjects proceeded to HSCT after liso-cel (98 and 183 days after liso-cel, respectively); 1 subject had a best response post-HSCT of MRD negative CR and 1 subject had a best response post-HSCT of CR.
- -In DL4: 1 (7.1%) subject proceeded to HSCT 101 days after liso-cel and had a best response post-HSCT of CR.

## Pharmacodynamic B-cell aplasia Results

Overall, rapid CD19+ B-cell recovery was observed in paediatric r/r B-ALL patients treated with liso-cel at all dose levels. CD19+ cells from 13 of 14 liso-cel treated patients had either recovered by month 6 (&gt;1 cell/µL) and/or the subjects have clinically progressed.

## Safety results

## Extent of Exposure

All 14 subjects who received liso-cel were infused with the planned volume of CD8+ and CD4+ × 10 6 CAR+ T cells i.e, no difference was noted between the planned volume and the actual volume of infused cells.

The median total number of CD8+ cells infused was 1.25 × 10 6  (range: 0.3, 25.3) and CD4+ cells were 1.24 × 10 6  (range: 0.3, 24.5) for the overall liso-cel treated population.

## Adverse events (AEs), Serious AEs (SAEs) and Deaths

All (n=14) subjects who received liso-cel experienced at least 1 TEAE between (first) liso-cel infusion and 30 days after (last) liso-cel infusion, while 7 (50%) subjects had experienced at least 1 TEAE between 31 and 90 days after (last) liso-cel infusion. Twelve (85.7%) subjects experienced at least 1 NCI CTCAE Grade 3/4 TEAE and 8 (57.1%) subjects experienced at least 1 NCI CTCAE Grade 3/4 TEAE that was related to liso-cel (see Table below).

Eleven  subjects  were  included  in  the  DLT  Analysis  Set.  Of  the  11  subjects,  3  (27.3%)  subjects experienced  a  DLT:  no  subjects  in  DL1  experienced  DLTs,  1  out  of  11  (9.1%)  subjects  (in  DL4) experienced a DLT of Grade 4 neurotoxicity with cerebral oedema. This DLT was observed in the first subject treated on-study, and prompted Protocol Amendment 2 which reduced the initial starting dose 10-fold. Two out of 11 (18.2%) subjects (both in DL2) experienced DLTs, both of these DLTs prompted dose de-escalations per protocol (1 subject experienced a DLT of Grade 4 liso-cel infusion reaction and 1 subject experienced a DLT of Grade 4 neurotoxicity with cerebral oedema and seizures, accompanied by Grade 1 CRS).

No second primary malignancies were reported during the study.

Exploratory Safety Assessment of Transgene Involvement

## Persistence of Vector Sequence (PVS) Monitoring

Of 10 samples from 4 subjects that were collected and tested at any time point after 12-months postinfusion, there were no samples that met the criteria (≥1% of the total nucleated blood cells containing transgene) for ISA.

Replication-competent Lentivirus (RCL) Testing

Of 37 samples tested from 15 subjects, no RCL was detected in any of the samples.

## MAH's conclusions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Data from BCM-004 demonstrated that liso-cel treatment in the paediatric r/r BALL population exhibited sub-optimal duration of clinical response, unfavourable adverse events with early occurrence of cerebral oedema at low dose levels, rapid CD19+ B-cell recovery (which is a biomarker that associates with a lack of CAR+ T cell function), and low overall in vivo CAR+ T cell expansion for the explored dose levels.

The very narrow therapeutic window described prevented a safe and effective RP2D dose from being established for the patient population of BCM-004, and therefore prohibited expansion into the Phase 2 portion of the study.

Considering the evolution of the treatment landscape since the trial initiation, including an approved CAR+ T cell therapy for this patient population that enables long term remissions with curative potential for children suffering from highly aggressive disease, this trial was terminated early to avoid exposing more children to suboptimal dose levels, and depriving them of potentially available curative treatment options.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The MAH of Breyanzi has submitted this variation application in accordance with Article 46 of regulation 1901/2006 to provide clinical data from Phase 1/2 study JCAR017-BCM-004 (hereafter referred to as study BCM-004).

Study BCM-004 was originally included in the PIP for Breyanzi and was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) for the treatment of paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R B-NHL).  However,  due  to  the  early  closure  of  the  study,  no  patient  with  R/R  B-NHL  was  eventually enrolled and only limited data from subjects with R/R B-ALL were submitted.

## Disease context

ALL is the most common malignancy in children (~40 cases per million diagnosed each year in the EU, with a peak incidence occurring between 0 and 5 years of age; see Parkin DM et al, WHO Fact Sheet 2009);  significant  improvements  in  cure  rates  have  been  observed  in  the  last  30  years,  especially following the introduction of multi-drug chemotherapy and allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT).  Recent  data  showed  that,  in  industrialised  countries,  the  cure  rate  of  paediatric  B-ALL approximated 90% (see e.g. Hunger SP et al, NEJM 2015). On the other hand, ALL treatments are highly complex, prolonged and demanding for the patients, being associated with significant short- and longterm toxicity.

Further, the outcomes of children with ALL who relapse following frontline treatment (especially in the case of early relapse) or have refractory disease are still unsatisfactory, and the long-term OS rate for these patients is ~50% (see e.g. Hunger SP et al, Blood 2020).

The therapy of R/R B-ALL in children is complex and include several different options. Conventional 'reinduction' chemotherapy regimens are the standard choice in first relapse for subjects with 'lower' risk disease (e.g. patients in late relapse). The main objective or re-induction is to achieve a second complete remission (CR2, possibly with no detectable minimal residual disease), and most re-induction regimens are based on 'standard' four-drug chemotherapy backbones, which include corticosteroids, vincristine, an anthracycline or mitoxantrone, and asparaginase. Drugs, doses and schedules are known to vary across cooperative groups/centres.

With the possible exceptions of MRD negative subjects with late/isolated extramedullary relapse, most children with R/R B-ALL who achieve CR2 and have a suitable donor procced to receive alloHSCT as 'consolidation'. AlloHSCT can improve, in fact, the patient chances for long-term disease-control/cure, and the best results are achieved in patients who are MRD negative before transplant (see e.g. Merli P

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

et al, Front Pediatr. 2021). Unfortunately, alloHSCT is also associated with severe toxicity both in the short and long-term.

The outcomes of patients who are primary refractory, or who are in their second/later relapse, or who have failed alloHSCT are inferior and treatment options are limited.

Blinatumomab (Blincyto), a bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) targeting CD3 on T cells and CD19 on B-ALL blasts, is approved in the EU as monotherapy for the treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year or older with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) CD19 positive B-ALL which is refractory or in relapse after receiving at least two prior therapies, or in relapse after receiving prior alloHSCT. The safety and efficacy of blinatumomab in this indication were assessed in single-arm trial MT103-205: the CRR was 28.6%, the  median  relapse-free  survival  was  6.8  months  and  the  most  frequently  reported  serious adverse reactions were pyrexia (11.4%), febrile neutropenia, (11.4%), cytokine release syndrome (CRS 5.7%), sepsis (4.3%), device-related infection (4.3%), overdose (4.3%), convulsion (2.9%), respiratory failure (2.9%), hypoxia (2.9%), pneumonia (2.9%), and multi-organ failure (2.9%) (see Blincyto SmPC).

Tisagenlecleucel  (tisa-cel,  Kymriah)  is  an  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  ATMP  approved  in  the  EU  for  the treatment of paediatric and young adult patients ≤25 years of age with B -ALL who are refractory, in relapse post-transplant or in second or later relapse. The approval of tisa-cel was based on the results from one single-arm phase II study (B2202, ELIANA) that showed high ORR and CRR (82% and 62%, respectively) in infused patients. The median DoR was 46.8 months and the 30-month DoR rate (56.2%) showed the potential for durable remissions. The most common non-haematological adverse reactions were CRS (75%), infections (70%), hypogammaglobulinaemia (49%) and pyrexia (43%). Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions were reported in 86% of patients, with CRS (37%) being the most common (see Kymriah SmPC and Laetsch TW et al, JCO 2023).

## Methods

Study BCM-004 comprised a Phase 1, dose-finding part, designed to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in two distinct cohorts (R/R B-ALL and MRD+/- B-ALL), and a Phase 2 part in which the efficacy and safety of liso-cel were to be further characterised in specific disease cohorts (R/R B-ALL, MRD+ B-ALL and R/R B-NHL).

The study structure was standard for CARTs and included a screening phase, a pre-treatment period (lasting  from  leukapheresis  to  infusion)  and  a  treatment  period  starting  from  the  administration  of lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LD) and lasting until Day 56, when confirmation of disease response was planned. All patients were further monitored for AEs/response in the follow-up phase until month 24, and up to 15 years in a separate long-term FU study.

Eligible  subjects  were  paediatric  patients  with  R/R  B-cell  ALL  aged  &lt;18  year  ( weight ≥ 6 kg ),  with evidence of CD19+ blasts via flow-cytometry/immunohistochemistry and at least 5% blasts in the bone marrow (BM). To be included, subjects were required to be in first or greater BM relapse or in any BM relapse after alloHSCT, to have primary refractory disease and/or to be ineligible to alloHSCT. The high unmet medical need in the advanced setting of relapse/refractoriness identified by the study inclusion criteria can be recognised.

As expected with CAR T cell products, subjects were also required to have a Karnofsky/Lansky score of 50% or higher and no clinically relevant co-morbidities; subjects with CNS-2 and CNS-3 disease could be enrolled, provided that no neurologic symptoms/disorders were present.

During the manufacturing/turnaround time between lymphocyte apheresis and liso-cel infusion patients were allowed to receive a single cycle of bridging therapy to control rapid disease progression. A 3-day LD chemotherapy  regimen  including fludarabine (30 mg/m 2 /day) and cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m 2 /day)  was  administered  2  to  7  days  before  liso-cel  infusion,  in  line  with  the  approved

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

recommendations for Breyanzi in the adult LBCL indications. It should be noted, however, that the LD regimen  in  study  BCM-004  differed  from  the  one  approved  for  tisa-cel  in  the  paediatric  R/R  B-ALL indication: in the tisa-cel label it is recommended, in fact, that fludarabine is administered for 4 days and a different cyclophosphamide posology (500 mg/m 2 /day for 2 days) is reported (see Kymriah SmPC). The possible consequences of such differences on CARTs efficacy and safety in the paediatric setting is not well characterised.

The initial starting dose for liso-cel was 0.5 x 10 6  CAR+ T cells/Kg (max dose 50 x 10 6  total CAR+ T cells) and was based on previous experience in the PLAT-02 study (see Gardner RA et al, Blood 2022). Due to severe neurotoxicity (see below), however, the original protocol was amended to identify a lower starting dose (0.05 x 10 6  CAR+ T cells/Kg, i.e. a 10-fold reduction compared to the initial starting dose). Although up to 5 dose levels were planned in study BCM-004, subjects were eventually treated only at DL1, DL2 and DL4 (i.e. the original starting dose).

A mTPI-2 algorithm was employed to guide dose-escalation decisions and to identify the RP2D; a DL was considered unsafe if it had an estimated 95% or more probability of exceeding the target DLT rate of 30% when at least 3 patients had received liso-cel at each DL. The use of the mTPI-2 design is endorsed in  a  paediatric  setting  to  minimise  the  risk  of  ineffective/toxic  exposures,  especially  considering  the CARTs potential for fatal adverse reactions and an unclear dose/toxicity relationship. The definitions for DLTs  in  study  BCM-004  were  adequate;  even  though  the  'acceptable'  levels  of  toxicity  were  not negligible, this can be justified since maximising anti-tumour efficacy is the primary aim in advanced disease settings characterised by limited life expectancy. Additional safety measures were anyway in place, e.g. the decision to open a new dose level for enrolment was informed by a dedicated safety review committee (SRC), and an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) oversaw the review of cumulative safety data over the curse of the study.

The main endpoint to explore efficacy in Phase 1 (i.e. BOR, ORR, DoR, CRR) are considered adequate to initially  characterise  liso-cel  activity  in  advanced  settings  of  R/R  ALL,  when  response  to  therapy  is expected to be limited and short-lasting.

## Results

## Efficacy

Overall, the study planned to treat approximately 30 patients in Phase 1 and 71 patients in Phase 2. However, only 24 subjects were eventually enrolled in Phase 1 (N=9 at DL1, N=8 at DL2, N=3 at DL4 and N=1 not assigned) and Phase 2 was never started because the RP2D could not be identified.

The  efficacy  analysis  population  (EAP)  included  only  those  subjects  who  fulfilled  all  study  eligibility criteria,  were at least MRD+ at baseline, and had received liso-cel manufactured in accordance with release specifications.

Of  the  24  subjects  enrolled,  13/24  died  (12/13  because  of  PD  and  1/13  because  of  post-transplant toxicity on Day 271), and 5/13 experienced fatal progression prior to receiving liso-cel, suggesting that the proportion of patients at higher risk of rapid progression was non-negligible in study BCM-004. The EAP eventually included 11 subjects: due to the limited sample size, efficacy data should be interpreted with caution.

Limited patient characteristic data were provided: the median age of the 21 subjects who were able to enter the pre-treatment period was 7 years (range 1, 17), with 18/21 subjects being aged &lt;12 years. With  respect  to  disease  characteristics,  43%  of  patients  had  previously  undergone  HSCT,  CNS involvement was not reported for the majority of subjects (yet 1 patient had CNS-3 at baseline), and no patient had Ph+ B-ALL. MLL rearrangements could be identified in 3 subjects, yet the majority of patients (81%) had no MLL status reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Five out of 11 subjects in the EAP set were able to achieve CRi with liso-cel (ORR 45.5%, 95%CI 16.7, 76.6). Although no CR was observed in study BCM-004, 3 subjects who achieved CRi were also MRD negative.  Five  subjects  could  not  be  evaluated  for  efficacy  because  of  lack  of  disease  response assessment at Day 28 (N=3) or lack of response confirmation at Day 56 (N=2). Five out of 11 subjects underwent alloHSCT after treatment with liso-cel, yet the available data are too limited to characterise liso-cel potential as bridging to alloHSCT. The median DoR in responders was 13.7 months (95%CI not estimable due to lack of data variability).

Overall, the limited efficacy data with liso-cel in this heavily pre-treated paediatric population were of some interest, since some potential for deep responses could be observed. However, the MAH's opinion that response duration was sub-optimal is agreed, especially when the results from study BCM-004 are looked in the context of the efficacy threshold set by tisa-cel in R/R B-ALL in the ELIANA study.

RFS, EFS and OS were of difficult interpretation in the absence of proper controls, yet the available data can be considered supportive of the reduced potential for long-lasting remission with liso-cel in paediatric R/R B-ALL.

## Safety

All 14 subjects in the 'infused' data-set received the planned liso-cel dose according to DL. The median total number of infused CD8+ and CD4+ CAR T cells was approximately 1.25 x 10 6  (range max 0.3, 25), which was significantly reduced compared to the median total dose received by adult subjects in the approved indications, and also to the dose approved in this setting for Kymriah for patients 50 kg and below (i.e. 0.2 to 5 × 10 6  CAR-positive viable T cells per kg body weight).

Despite the low starting dose, all subjects in study BCM-004 experienced at least one TEAE during the treatment phase, 12/14 had at least one Grade 3/4 TEAE, and 9/14 had at least one serious TEAE.

At least one TEAE of CRS was reported for the majority of patients (64%) and 4/14 subjects reported at least one TEAE of neurotoxicity (iiNT). One subject who received liso-cel experienced a Grade 4 iiNT event (cerebral oedema) that was considered a DLT at DL4, and another subject experienced a Grade 4 iiNT event (cerebral oedema and seizures) that was adjudicated as a DLT at DL2. One additional patient experienced a Grade 3 iiNT event (seizures) that was not considered a DLT at DL1.

Both  DLT  events  prompted  dose  de-escalation  according  to  the  mTPI-2  algorithm  and  eventually prevented the identification of a safe and effective dose for Phase 2.

## PK/PD

As already observed with liso-cel in the adult LBCL population, non-responders generally exhibited lower expansions of both CD4+ and CD8+ CAR T cell populations compared to responders. However, in this paediatric population, a limited expansion of the CD4+ component could also be observed in responders.

Further, rapid CD19+ B-cell recovery was observed at all the explored DLs, which has been associated with poor long-term disease control after anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapies (see e.g. Pulsipher MA et al, Blood  Cancer  Discov  2022).  In  particular,  13/14  subjects  who  received  liso-cel  in  study  BCM-004 experienced either CD19+ B cel recovery or PD by month 6.

The  mechanisms  behind  these  findings  and  their  possible  contribution  to  the  limited  efficacy  and unacceptable toxicity observed in study BCM-004 have not been sufficiently characterised, at present.

## Conclusions

Overall, the MAH's conclusions that further expansion of study BCM-004 in Phase 2 was prevented by the observed limited efficacy and the uncertain relationship between dose and severe iiNT is agreed. Based on the available data, the therapeutic window of liso-cel in paediatric R/R B-ALL is considered too

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

narrow  to  allow  for  further  investigation,  especially  considering  the  presence  of  effective  approved alternatives in this clinical setting (e.g. tisa-cel).

Based on the available data, a product specific waiver in accordance to Article 11(1)(c) of the current paediatric Regulation was granted by the PDCO on October 2023, on the ground that liso-cel did not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for paediatric patients with B-ALL and mature B cell neoplasms. Consequently, study BCM-004 was terminated on Jan 2024.

Considering  the  low  risk  for  off-label  use  (liso-cel  is  commercialised  under  a  controlled  distribution program in the EU and more effective and safer alternatives are currently approved) and the limited information provided by data from study BCM-004, the MAH's opinion that no change is warranted in the current SmPC of Breyanzi is agreed.

| Development of a new manufacturing process and formulation to generate JCAR017 product for paediatric patients (and young adults)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |              1 | December 2024        | N/A                                        |
| Open-label, single dose, single-arm, multi-cohort trial to evaluate the activity and safety of JCAR017 in children less than 18 years of age (and adults) and weighing at least 6 kg with relapsed or refractory (r/r) B- cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) or with r/r B-cell non- Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |              2 | December 2024        | NA                                         |
| Open-label, non-randomised, multi- cohort trial to assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of administering a T cell product containing CD4 and CD8 cells derived from patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells that has been genetically modified using a self- inactivating lentiviral vector to express a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and the EGFRt (truncated epidermal growth factor receptor) to children from 1 year to less than 18 years of age (and adults) weighing at least 10 kg with relapsed or refractory CD19+ leukaemia |              3 | December 2024        | N/A                                        |

Following the latest application for a modification to the agreed liso-cel paediatric investigation plan (PIP, decision EMEA-001995-PIP01-16-M04 dated 27 October 2023), a product specific waiver in accordance with Article 11(1)(c) of said Regulation was granted, on the grounds that the specific medicinal product did not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for paediatric patients. The waiver covered all subsets of the paediatric population in the following two conditions:

- Treatment of B-lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma
- Treatment of mature B-cell neoplasms

Consequently, ongoing study 2 was early terminated on 26 January 2024.
