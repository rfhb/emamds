## Introduction

In July 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Synflorix , in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

The MAH stated that the data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for Synflorix .

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Information on the development program

The applicant states that the study DTPa-IPV-059 'A phase III, randomised, open-label, multicentre study to assess the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals ' combined DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine administered as a three-dose primary vaccination course at 2-4-6 months of age in healthy infants in South Korea' is a stand alone study.

## 1.2. Clinical aspects

## 1.2.1. Introduction

Synflorix is a 10-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine containing polysaccharides of 8 pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14 and 23F conjugated individually to protein D, a highly conserved protein of non-typeable Haemophilus influenza, serotype 18C conjugated to tetanus toxoid and serotype 19F conjugated to diphtheria toxoid. The first license for Synflorix was obtained from the Canadian authorities in December 2008, followed by Australia and the EU in 2009. The current therapeutic indications in the Synflorix SmPC are active immunisation against invasive disease, pneumonia and acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants and children from 6 weeks up to 5 years of age.

As stated in the Synflorix SmPC, Synflorix can be given concomitantly with any of the following monovalent or combination vaccines (including DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib and DTPw-HBV/Hib): diphtheriatetnaus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTPa), hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (Hib), diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis vaccine (DTPw), measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR), varicella vaccine (V), meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine (CRM197 and TT conjugates), meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccine (TT conjugate), oral polio vaccine (OPV) and oral rotavirus vaccine.

The current submission pertains to fulfilling the requirements of Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 towards the Synflorix license. The study was not included in the agreed Synflorix paediatric investigation plan.

## 1.2.2. Clinical study

## Study DTPa-IPV-059

A phase III, randomised, open-label, multicentre study to assess the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals'combined DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine administered as a three-dose primary vaccination course at 2-4-6 months of age in healthy infants in South Korea

## Description

## Methods

## Study design and objectives

Study DTPA-IPV (INFANRIX-IPV)-059 (114260) was a phase III, randomized, open study conducted in South Korea to assess the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of GSK Biologicals' combined DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine when administered as a three-dose primary vaccination at 2-4-6 months of age in healthy infants. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate that the immunogenicity of the DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine was non-inferior to that of the concomitant administration of DTPa-IPV and Hib vaccines in terms of immune response to all vaccine antigens, one month after the third dose of the primary vaccination. The secondary objectives of the study were to assess the immune response to the DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine  versus the DTPa-IPV and Hib vaccines administered separately, the safety and reactogenicity following vaccination with these vaccines, as well as the occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs) with respect to all study vaccines throughout the study, i.e., from the administration of the first dose of Rotarix and Synflorix at 6 weeks of age until the visit post-primary vaccination at 7 months of age.

## Assessor's comment:

In this study, Synflorix was concomitantly administered with other vaccines. Only the results regarding Synflorix will be evaluated in the present P46 procedure report.

Subjects were randomized to two groups to receive either (a) 3 doses of GSK Biologicals combined DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine (Combo group) OR (b) 3 doses of DTPa-IPV and Hib vaccines administered separately (Control group). Synflorix and Rotarix vaccines were administered in the study in a staggered manner i.e. 3 doses of Synflorix at 6 weeks, 3.5 months and 5.5 months of age and two doses of Rotarix at 6 weeks and 3.5 months of age. Blood samples were collected before the first dose and after the third dose of either the DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine or co-administered DTPa-IPV and Hib vaccines; however no assessment of immune response to Synflorix was perfomed.

## Assessor's comment:

It is noted that all participants received Synflorix in combination with other vaccines.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 451 infants (combo group=224; control group=227) were enrolled between 04 March 2011 and 24 February 2012.

## Efficacy results

## Immunogenicity:

One month after the third dose of the primary vaccination, the non-inferiority of the DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine (combo group) administered at 2, 4 and 6 months of age to that of the concomitant administration of DTPa-IPV and Hib vaccines (control group) in terms of seroprotection rates for antibodies against diphtheria, tetanus, poliovirus type 1, poliovirus type 2, poliovirus type 3 and PRP antigens and GMCs of antibodies against PT, FHA and PRN antigens, was demonstrated. Therefore, the primary objective of the study was met.

## Assessor's comment:

No immunogenicity results for Synflorix were generated in study DTPA-IPV-059.

## Safety/reactogenicity:

A total of 57 SAEs were reported in 46 subjects (25 subjects in the combo group and 21 subjects in the control group). Among the SAEs, bronchiolitis, urinary tract infections and gastroenteritis were the most frequently reported SAEs in both the groups. All other SAEs also led to hospitalization and were resolved by the end of study. None of the SAEs were considered related to vaccination by the investigator. The administration of all study vaccines was considered safe and generally well tolerated.

## Assessor's comment:

No SAEs considered related to vaccination were identified within the study.

As there was no control group that did not receive Synflorix, it is difficult to draw specific conclusions of events possibly related to Synflorix vaccination. Moreover, such conclusions are even more difficult to perform as concomitant administration with other vaccines was done.

The data appears to be in line with the approved SPC of Synflorix and no new safety concerns have been identified from study DTPA-IPV-059.

## 1.2.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

In the present study, Synflorix was concomitantly administered with other vaccines. No immunogenicity endpoints regarding Synflorix were included in the study, but SAEs were evaluated. A total of 451 infants were enrolled in the study. No new safety concerns were identified from the study and the results on Synflorix is in consistency with the approved SPC.

## 2. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Overall conclusion

This article 46 submission is considered satisfactory and no further regulatory action regarding Synflorix is required.

## Recommendation
