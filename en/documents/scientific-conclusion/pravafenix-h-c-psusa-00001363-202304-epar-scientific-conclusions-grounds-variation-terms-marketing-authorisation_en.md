## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for fenofibrate / pravastatin, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on muscle rupture from the literature and spontaneous reports including in 62 cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge (14 cases) and/or re-challenge (2 cases) and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between pravastatin and muscle rupture is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing fenofibrate/pravastatin should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for fenofibrate / pravastatin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing fenofibrate / pravastatin is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
