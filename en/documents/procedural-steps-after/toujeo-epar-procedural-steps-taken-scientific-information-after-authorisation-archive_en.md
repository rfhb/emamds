| II/0076 | Update of section 4.6 of the SmPC based on results of a meta-analysis of published data and a review of other published and post-marketing data of insulin glargine use during pregnancy. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 18/12/2013 | 15/12/2014 | SmPC and PL | Within this variation the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) updated section 4.6 of the SmPC with information of the use of insulin glargine in pregnancy. In support of the application, the MAH presented results of a meta-analysis of published data on the use of insulin glargine compared to NPH in pregnancy, as well as additional available clinical data published up to 20 May 2013 and post-marketing data. The meta-analysis comprised 8 observational cohort studies with a total of 702 women with pregestational or gestational diabetes, of whom 331 received insulin glargine and 371 received NPH insulin. The meta-analysis examined maternal outcomes for efficacy and safety, and neonatal outcomes. The results of the meta-analysis did not reveal any significant increased risk associated with the use of insulin glargine compared with NPH insulin for any of the maternal or neonatal outcomes reported. With regard to the safety of insulin glargine use during pregnancy, in comparison to NPH insulin, there was no increased risk to the mother for weight gain, severe hypoglycemia, gestational/new-onset hypertension, preeclampsia, or cesarean section. While individual studies did inconsistently report differences, many of the individual findings were favourable to insulin glargine. Glycaemic control as measured by first and third trimester HbA1c was not different between the pregnant |

The CHMP conclusion on the meta-analysis was that it supports the overall insulin glargine program results, but could not constitute a stand-alone demonstration of glargine efficacy and safety in pregnant women with diabetes due to the limitations of the observational non- randomized design of the published reports. In addition to the meta-analysis the MAH also submitted a cumulative summary of exposure reports since the launch of the product and provided information received during the current 6-month reporting period through 21 October 2012. Pregnancy outcomes reported to date in this diabetic patient population do not suggest a new risk for patients treated with insulin glargine. This conclusion was endorsed by the CHMP.   |

| II/0071   | Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to include the results from the ORIGIN trial. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 9.0, and some typographical errors were corrected in the SmPC. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 30/05/2013   | 20/12/2013   | SmPC, Annex II and PL   | This variation was submitted to support an update of the Lantus prescribing information based on data from the ORIGIN trial (Outcomes Reduction with an Initial Glargine INtervention). This was a multinational 7-year randomized clinical study that investigated the effect of Lantus on cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in patients with prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose [IFG], impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) or early Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who had evidence of CV disease. The first coprimary endpoint (composite of the first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke) did not show any difference between insulin glargine and standard care. Also, the second coprimary endpoint (hospitalization for heart failure or revascularization procedure added to the first three components), did not show any difference. In addition, analysis by various subgroups did not reveal significant differences. Outcomes of secondary and tertiary endpoints were consistent. Therefore, it is concluded that early treatment with insulin glargine had no effect (beneficial or detrimental) on CV morbidity or cardiovascular and over-all mortality. This is an important finding that has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. In subjects with prediabetes, there was a numeric reduction in the percentage of subjects developing diabetes at the first post-EUF OGTT, but this effect declined after 3 months and was not clinically relevant. Cancer relationship to insulin glargine was not demonstrated in any cancer subtype (e.g. breast, colon, prostate, lung), or for new or recurrent cancers, or deaths   |

| from cancer, over 6.2 years of median follow-up. Kaplan- Meier curves for the first cancer diagnosed during the trial, the first new cancer diagnosed, and death due to cancer were practically superimposable between the insulin glargine and standard care groups. Although this is important information, it has not been included in the SmPC because, (i) the design of the ORIGIN study was not anticipated in order to assess the risks of cancer (ii) it is questionable whether these results could be extrapolated to long-standing diabetes with high doses of insulin (iii) available epidemiological results regarding the risk of breast cancer for longer exposures to glargine are not fully consistent across different studies. No unexpected safety issues were seen in this trial. As was expected weight did increase, and hypoglycaemia was still the major adverse event seen in association with treatment with insulin glargine. Rates of hypoglycemia in ORIGIN might be lower than those seen in other CV intervention trials in diabetes; however, as no beneficial effect of insulin glargine could be detected in this trial, an increase in the incidence of hypoglycaemia is a disadvantage. In summary, any benefit of early treatment with insulin on lower levels of HbA1 without improvement in CV outcome is outweighed by its side effects and applicability. The following text was included in section 5.1 of the SmPC to describe the design and results of this study: 'The ORIGIN (Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine INtervention) study was a multicenter, randomized, 2x2 factorial design study conducted in 12,537 participants at high cardiovascular (CV) risk with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (12% of participants) or type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with ≤1   |

| antidiabetic oral agent (88% of participants). Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive insulin glargine (n=6264), titrated to reach FPG ≤95 mg/dL (5.3 mM), or standard care (n=6273). The first co primary efficacy outcome was the time to the first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke, and the second co primary efficacy outcome was the time to the first occurrence of any of the first co primary events, or revascularisation procedure (coronary, carotid, or peripheral), or hospitalisation for heart failure. Secondary endpoints included all cause mortality and a composite microvascular outcome. Insulin glargine did not alter the relative risk for CV disease and CV mortality when compared to standard of care. There were no differences between insulin glargine and standard care for the two co primary outcomes; for any component endpoint comprising these outcomes; for all cause mortality; or for the composite microvascular outcome. Mean dose of insulin glargine by study end was 0.42 U/kg. At baseline, participants had a median HbA1c value of 6.4% and median on-treatment HbA1c values ranged from 5.9 to 6.4% in the insulin glargine group, and 6.2% to 6.6% in the standard care group throughout the duration of follow up. The rates of severe hypoglycaemia (affected participants per 100 participant years of exposure) were 1.05 for insulin glargine and 0.30 for standard care group and the rates of confirmed non severe hypoglycaemia were 7.71 for insulin glargine and 2.44 for standard care group.

| WS/0208   | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 6.6 for SoloStar pre-filled pen presentation for the Insuman, Insuman Human Whintrop, Apidra, Lantus and Optisulin to reinforce the appropriate use of SoloStar. The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance. Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to bring the PI in line with latest QRD template version 8.0 for Insuman, Apidra, Lantus and Optisulin. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 15/03/2012 | 20/04/2012 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Update of the labelling documents for three sanofi-aventis insulins is proposed in this type II variation to reinforce the appropriate use of Solostar prefilled pen. This update is based on the experience gained since 2006 (e.g. following reports and questions raised by the pen users) and a continued evaluation of possible improvements of the Product Information. During this period a number of product technical complaints were received concerning the functionality of the pen, namely a blocked pen, where it is impossible to dial or inject a dose. The cause was identified that when dialling a dose and pushing the dose button without a needle attached to the pen, a mechanical pressure within the system builds, leading to a blockage of the pen mechanism. For this reason the Instructions for Use are updated to make the patient aware not to dial a dose or push the dose button without having a needle attached. There was no technical change made to the Solostar prefilled pen. |

| II/0061 | Update of sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the Summary of Products Characteristics (SmPC) to reflect new data on insulin glargine metabolites.

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 21/07/2011 | 24/08/2011 | SmPC and PL | Insulin glargine is metabolized in the subcutaneous (SC) tissue at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain to form the two active metabolites, M1 and M2. With the availability of a new specific and quantitative bioanalytical method, pharmacokinetic (PK) samples collected in a euglycaemic clamp study were used to further explore the systemic exposure to unchanged insulin glargine and the two metabolites M1 and M2 in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and the correlation to the established glucodynamic effect. In this clinical study insulin glargine was used as a reference at single SC doses of 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 U/kg. The results of this study demonstrated that M1 was the principle circulating compound whereas unchanged insulin glargine and metabolite M2 were detected in only very few individual patients at few time points. The glucodynamic response correlated with metabolite M1 exposure. The CHMP agreed that this new data on insulin glargine metabolites was added to the SmPC. |

The complexity regarding the various insulin treatments used in a single diabetic patient, (i.e. long acting, rapid acting; with the latter needing to be administered multiple times a day) in order to achieve optimal glycaemia control has created a situation wherein product differentiation becomes increasingly important. Adverse events associated with insulins mix-ups, often result in massive overdose of the rapid-acting insulin which may subsequently lead to hypoglycaemia, which if left untreated may be life-threatening, or result in death. In most cases, however, the patients noticed the mistake and |

In order to mitigate the risk of medication errors, the MAH has focused its efforts up to now on educational activities to ensure the safe administration of their insulins. The MAH has also focused on differentiation strategies for insulin products to mitigate the potential risk of administering the wrong insulin to a person with diabetes. The product information for all the insulins from this MAH has been updated through the present variation to include warnings on the risk of insulin mix-up. Additionally, the MAH will incorporate changes to the existing insulins packaging. The aim of these changes is to better differentiate the different products and to increase readability for the pharmacist, Health Care Professional or patient in order to reduce potential mix-ups.   |

The changes were supported by the study HOE901/4030 which was an open label, randomised, gender-stratified, and parallel-group. Section 4.8 of the SPC has been updated with the following wording: \"In general, the safety profile for patients ? 18 years of age is similar to the safety profile for patients > 18 years. The adverse event reports received from Post Marketing Surveillance included relatively more frequent injection site reactions (injection site pain, injection site reaction) and skin reactions (rash, urticaria) in patients ? 18 years of age than in patients > 18 years. No clinical study safety data are available in patients below 6 years of age.\" The PL has been updated accordingly.   |

Some devices were investigated after the reported failure and the manufacturer's reports conclude in a suspected user's failure rather than a device failure. Some of the patients experienced serious clinical events and there been a relatively high number of these user errors: patients indicated that they were not aware whether the pen had actually delivered a dose or not and some mentioned that the displayed dose did not seem to correspond to what was actually set or seem to be delivered. It was remarked that the Optipen has an electronic display indicating the dose setting. This could   |

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet |              |              | PL                    | solution a Optipen have several be a potential source for malfunctioning since it may be hampered by electromagnetic field influences (microwave, TV). The pens returned and investigated appeared to function well. However, the current SPC and PL of Optisulin solution for injection in a cartridge do not provide instructions for handling the OptiPen in case of mechanical defects. Information was therefore added to section 6.6 of the SPC. This information was also added to the labelling of the outer packaging as well as clarification that the cartridges are to be used in conjunction with OptiPen only. To section 3 of the Package Leaflet was added the advice to follow the manufacturer's instructions for using the pen carefully for loading the cartridge, attaching the needle, and                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| II/0008   | Update of section 4.4 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and section 4 of the Package Leaflet to include a warning concerning hypoglycaemia as requested by the CHMP and to include a class wording regarding hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin to human insulins. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   | 17/12/2003   | 02/03/2004   | SmPC and PL   | The CHMP requested an update of section 4.4 of the SC to include a class labelling for all centrally authorised human insulins (conclusions September 2001 CHMP) relating to hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin to human insulin. This information was added to section 4.4. of the SPC and section 4 of the Package Leaflet. Following the assessment of the 3rd PSUR the MAH was requested to add SPC a warning that due to the prolonged effect of subcutaneous insulin glargine the recovery from hypoglycaemia may be delayed. The MAH was requested by CPMP to include this wording in section 4.4 of the SPC after the text \"Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the patients awareness of hypoglycaemia\". Further changes in sections 4.6, 4.8, 5.1, 5.3, 6.4, 6.5 and 8 of the SPC were made to bring the SPC in line with the QRD templates and to update the ATC code. Changes regarding QRD templates and an update of the local representatives have also been proposed for the Package Leaflet (introduction section, sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).   |
