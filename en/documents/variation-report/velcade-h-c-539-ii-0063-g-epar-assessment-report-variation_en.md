## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Multiple Myeloma (MM) (also known as plasma cell myeloma) is a progressive rare hematologic disease. It is characterized by excessive numbers of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow and overproduction of intact monoclonal immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, IgD, or IgE) or Bence-Jones protein only (free immunoglobulin monoclonal κ and λ light chains). Multiple myeloma usually manifests as 1 or more lytic bone lesions, monoclonal protein in the blood or urine, and disease in the bone marrow.

Chemotherapy is indicated for patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic myeloma, with age, performance status, and neurologic and comorbidity conditions being critical factors in the choice of initial therapy. With standard chemotherapeutic agents, median survival time is approximately 3 years from diagnosis but the use of autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) has increased median survival to 5 years for patients less than 65 years of age. Nevertheless, MM remains an incurable disease, and almost all patients will eventually relapse and die from this disorder. In the absence of a definitive cure for multiple myeloma, the current goal of treatment is to improve patients' long-term outcomes, such as progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. One important factor that has been associated with prolonged PFS and overall survival is the magnitude of response to treatment, particularly achievement of CR.

In patients who are candidates for auto-SCT, induction treatment before auto-SCT with combination regimens containing at least 1 novel agent (i.e. bortezomib, thalidomide, lenalidomide), followed by high dose chemotherapy with melphalan and subsequent single or tandem ASCT is the recommended treatment option.

Despite successful first-line treatment, virtually all patients will eventually relapse/progress, or become refractory to treatment. For patients with relapsed or refractory disease, the ultimate goal of therapy is still to achieve the best possible response. Data from clinical studies have shown that, similar to newly diagnosed patients, the quality and magnitude of response in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma are associated with clinical benefit and better long-term outcomes.

Multiple myeloma relapsing after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) has a poor outcome.

VELCADE (bortezomib) as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

There is a growing body of clinical evidence from company-sponsored and independently conducted studies, as well as reports in the literature, that VELCADE in combination with other agents improves the efficacy of treatment for patients with relapsed/progressive or refractory multiple myeloma.

Anthracyclines, particularly doxorubicin, are widely used in the front-line setting to treat multiple myeloma. It has been shown that proteasome inhibitors enhance chemosensitivity and that the combination of an anthracycline with a proteosome inhibitor enhances antitumor activity in solid tumors and multiple myeloma models. However, cumulative doses of traditional doxorubicin are associated with increased cardiotoxicity. The pegylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, was designed to enhance the efficacy and reduce the dose-limiting toxicities of doxorubicin by altering the plasma pharmacokinetics and selective tissue distribution of the drug. Because of its reduced cardiotoxicity potential, Caelyx was selected as the anthracycline of choice to combine with VELCADE for the treatment of patients with progressive disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The combination of Velcade with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx from the same MAH of Velcade, Janssen Cilag) with Velcade was approved in 2007 within the variation II/45 for Caelyx in which the Applicant had already submitted this pivotal clinical study, MMY-3001 to demonstrate the efficacy of Caelyx when combined with Bortezomib, compared to Bortezomib monotherapy, in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. As a result of the approval of such extension of indication for Caelyx, the CHMP sent, in July 2011, a letter to the MAH of Velcade (the same for both products) recommending the submission of a variation for VELCADE to update the product information with regard to its use in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.

The combination of Velcade with dexamethasone has also been shown to improve response in subjects who had an initially poor response to VELCADE monotherapy. Currently, the combination of Velcade to Dexamethasone is considered a standard clinical practice. In several clinical studies, although not foreseen in the study object, dexamethasone was allowed at the discretion of the investigator.

Consequently, the MAH of Velcade has submitted this group of variations to extend the indication of Velcade as follows (new text underlined, deleted text strikethrough):

'VELCADE as monotherapy or in combination with pegylated liposomal-doxorubicin or dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and/or progressive multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for bone marrow transplantation.'

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

As this change of indication will align the product information with current medical practice, the MAH did not expect an increase in the environmental exposure of bortezomib following the approval of this variation. This was agreed by the CHMP.

Bortezomib and/or its metabolites are unlikely to represent a risk to the environment following prescribed usage in patients.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.2. Clinical pharmacology

No formal evaluations of the clinical pharmacology and dose finding of VELCADE in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx) or dexamethasone have been performed.

Two published references were included in this application to support the chosen Velcade, Caelyx and dexamethasone dosages.

A Phase 1 study (Orlowski RZ Vorhees PM, Garcia RA, et al. Phase I trial of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. Blood 2005; 105:3058-3065) conducted in 42 subjects with advanced hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma, showed that the combined administration of VELCADE and CAELYX/DOXIL did not alter the pharmacokinetics of CAELYX/DOXIL.

A Phase I study (Hellman A, Rule S, Walewski J. Effect of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers on the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety profiles of bortezomib in patients with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Clin Pharmacokinet 2011; 50(12):781-791) showed that in 18 subjects, 13 of whom had relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, who received treatment with a combination of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m 2  IV on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 3 weeks) plus dexamethasone (40 mg orally on Days 1 through 4 and 9 through 12 of Cycle 3), the co-administration of dexamethasone did not affect the bioavailability of VELCADE.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

While evidence from a published phase 1 study showed that bortezomib, a weak inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isozymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, did not alter the PK of Caelyx, no information is available for PK parameters of bortezomib when administered with Caelyx. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic parameters of doxorubicin from different dose levels were pooled together when administered together with bortezomib, and the pharmacokinetic parameters of doxorubicin when bortezomib was not given were not presented in the publication. Based on the presented literature the effect of the co-administration of bortezomib and doxorubicin on pharmacokinetics of both drugs remains still unclear.

As regards dexamethasone, the co-administration of dexamethasone, a weak CYP 3A4 inducer, did not have significant effect on exposure of bortezomib. The AUCs of bortezomib with and without concomitant dexamethasone were comparable based on the literature reference.

Considering that in study MMY-2045 dexamethasone was given at a lower dose level (20 mg) vs 40 mg administered in the cited published Phase 1 study, no significant alteration of the Velcade PK is expected by the co-administration with dexamethasone. Moreover, currently in the Velcade SmPC section 4.5 it is reported:

'In the same drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of dexamethasone, a weaker CYP3A4 inducer, on bortezomib (injected intravenously), there was no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib based on data from 7 patients.'

## 2.3.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

No formal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies are available for bortezomib when administered together with doxorubicin or dexamethasone,. However, this is acceptable as clinical efficacy and safety data have been submitted to support this application.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Main studies

## Study MMY-3001 (combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin)

This study was previously submitted and assessed by the CHMP for the extension of indication of Caelyx (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) in combination with bortezomib for the treatment of progressive multiple myeloma in patients who have received at least one prior therapy and who have undergone or are unsuitable for bone marrow transplant (EMEA/H/C/000089/II/0045, Commission Decision on 14 December 2007). Methods and results are summarised in this report, with further details available in the CHMP Assessment report of the Caelyx variation.

## Methods

Study MMY-3001 was a Phase III, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, active-controlled multicentre study. The aim was to compare the safety and efficacy of Caelyx/Bortezomib combination therapy with Bortezomib monotherapy in adult subjects with multiple myeloma, whose disease has progressed after at least one regimen of prior chemotherapy or was refractory to initial treatment.

The primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP). The secondary endpoints were OS and response rate.

The sample size for the study was estimated by assuming that the time to progression on the Bortezomib monotherapy arm was 6 months. An improvement in median time to progression from 6 months to 7.8 months was considered to be clinically relevant. This corresponds to a hazard ratio of 1.3.

## Results

646 subjects were randomly assigned 1:1 to treatment with Caelyx/Bortezomib combination therapy (n=324) or Bortezomib monotherapy (n=322).

The median number of cycles received was 5 and the median duration of treatment was approximately 3.5 months in both arms

## Primary endpoint

At the planned interim analysis (cut-off April, 2006), the median TTP was 6.5 months in bortezomib arm vs 9.3 months in the Caelyx-bortezomib arm (gain of 2.8 months; HR 1.82 CI [1.41, 2.35], P=0.000004).

At an unplanned TTP and survival analysis requested by the FDA (cut-off November 2006), the median TTP was 6.9 months in the bortezomib arm and 8.9 months in the Caelyx-bortezomib arm (gain of 2 months; HR=1.55 CI [1.27, 1.89], p=0.000013). Based on these results it was decided to stop rule defined for the initial interim analysis.

## Secondary endpoint

At the time of the pre-planned interim analysis, 12% of subjects (39) in the Bortezomib arm and 9% (28) of subjects in the Caelyx-bortezomib arm had died (p=0.113 stratified log-rank test, hazard ratio = 1.48 with 95% CI [0.91, 2.41]). The trend was in favour of the combination group but statistical significance had not been achieved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At the time of the unplanned interim analysis, a total of 139 deaths, 81 subjects in the Bortezomib arm and 58 in the Caelyx-bortezomib arm, and a median follow-up of 10.9 months and a mortality risk reduction point estimate of 29% (hazard ratio [95%CI]:1.406 [1.002 to 1.972]). This was an unplanned analysis (albeit requested by the FDA), so the precise interpretation of p-values was difficult, but the p-value was less than 0.048. Hence if this had been the final analysis a benefit in overall survival would have been shown.

As regards the ORR, 43% subjects (95% CI: 37.3; 48.6) achieved a complete or partial response in the Bortezomib arm compared with 48% subjects (95% CI: 41.8; 53.3) in the Caelyx-bortezomib arm (p=0.2514).

An unplanned survival update to allow assessment of the latest available data was requested by the CHMP in order to confirm the positive result in the primary endpoint TTP in the context of overall clinical benefit. As data cut off August 2007, an additional 67 deaths (38 in the Caelyx-bortezomib arm and 29 in the bortezomib arm) were reported (HR=0.86 CI: 0.649; 1.127) with 14% risk reduction.

## Study MMY-2045 (combination with dexamethasone)

## Methods

Study MMY-2045 was a Phase 2, multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel group study in subjects with multiple myeloma who were refractory to or had relapsed/progressed after their primary therapy for multiple myeloma.

## Study participants

The population included men and women ≥18 years of age with relapsed/progressive or refractory multiple myeloma after 1 prior therapy and a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of ≥60%.

Subject had a life expectancy estimated at screening of at least 6 months.

Measurable secretory multiple myeloma: measurable disease for secretory multiple myeloma was defined by at least one of the following measurements: serum M-protein greater than or equal to 1 g/dl (≥10 gm/l) [10 g/l], urine M-protein of ≥200 mg/24 hours.

Among the exclusion criteria there were:

- Subject received more than one previous line of therapy for multiple myeloma.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Subject has peripheral neuropathy or neuropathic pain of grade 2 or greater intensity.
- Subject had a myocardial infarction within 6 months of enrolment or has New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities.

## Treatments

The study involved the use of Velcade in combination with dexamethasone (VD), followed by VD, VD plus cyclophosphamide (VDC), or VD plus lenalidomide (VDL).

The study consisted of two sequential parts.

In Part 1, patients received a combination of VD. Based on the response to this treatment, further study treatment (Part 2) was customized.

In Part 2:

i) subjects with a complete, a very good partial or a partial response continued to receive VD for a maximum additional 4 cycles, to an overall maximum of 8 cycles.

ii) subjects achieving stable disease, as defined by International Myeloma Working Group 2006 response criteria, underwent a central randomisation to treatment with VD or VDC or VDL. The randomization was stratified by age (65 years or more versus less than 65 years) and country. After randomization, subjects received up to an additional 4 (3-week) cycles of treatment.

The mode of administration of each treatment was:

- VELCADE 1.3 mg/m² intravenous bolus on Days 1, 4, 8 and 11; 3-week cycle.
- Dexamethasone 20 mg orally daily, on Days 1 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12;
- Cyclophosphamide 500 mg, orally daily, on Days 1, 8 and 15;
- Lenalidomide 10 mg orally daily, on Days 1 to 14.

Figure 1 - Overview of the clinical study

## Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of adding either cyclophosphamide or lenalidomide in a randomized way to VELCADE-dexamethasone. The efficacy response was measured by the response rate of the disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR as defined by the combination of subjects with CR, VGPR and PR during study and before the start of further therapies for multiple myeloma according to the IMWG criteria (Table 3).

Secondary efficacy endpoints were defined as below:

- TTR: Time from start of treatment to the date of the first documentation of a confirmed response.
- DOR: Applied to subjects achieving at least PR by the IMWG criteria and was measured from the start of achieving PR (first observation of PR before confirmation) to the time of disease progression or relapse from CR, with deaths owing to causes other than progression not counted, but censored.
- TTP: Time from start of treatment to the date of the first observation of disease progression or relapse from CR. Deaths owing to causes other than progression were not counted, but censored.
- PFS: Time from start of treatment to date of disease progression, relapse from CR or death.
- OS: Time interval from start of treatment to the date of death due to any cause. In the absence of confirmation of death (including subjects lost to follow-up), survival time was censored at the last date the subject was known to be alive.
- One-year survival: The proportion of subjects with a one year survival since the start of treatment (based on the Kaplan-Meier estimation).

Efficacy was evaluated (at Day 1 of Cycles 1 to 8 and End of Treatment) as the measurement of Mprotein in serum and urine, until disease progression or relapse.

## Sample size

The sample size for each treatment arm was calculated based on Fleming Single Stage procedure. The assumption was that if the overall response to treatment was 20% this would be considered worthwhile to be investigated further and that the minimal expected response rate of interest was 7.5%. With a power of 80% and alfa=5%, 38 subjects were required per treatment arm. Thus, a total of 114 subjects needed to be randomized. Based on the assumption that around 60% of the subjects would have SD after 4 cycles of Velcade and dexamethasone, it was estimated that at least 190 subjects needed to be enrolled in the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Randomisation

After having received 4 cycles of VD, subjects with SD as best response were randomized. It was assumed that 60% of the subjects enrolled in the study would be available for randomization. Within this subpopulation it was assumed that an additional 20% would show a response of at least PR.

## Blinding (masking)

Not applicable.

## Statistical methods

Since randomization occurred after 4 cycles of treatment, the population was referred to as the modified intent-to-treat (mITT=all subjects who received at least 1 dose and who had at least 1 post baseline efficacy assessment were included in the analysis) rather than the intent-to-treat population (PP=all mITT subjects without major protocol deviations).

The primary analysis population was the mITT population.

The safety analysis was performed using the safety analysis set.

A preplanned interim analysis of efficacy and safety was performed when all subjects had completed 4 cycles of VD (clinical cutoff date of 30 April 2010). An additional efficacy and safety analysis was performed after all subjects had reached the end of treatment (clinical cutoff date of 1 July 2011). The final analysis was performed at the end of the follow-up period (clinical cutoff of 2 August 2011).

Note: Percentages are calculated with the number of subjects in each group as denominator.

Note: Only the non-randomized VD subjects are included for Study VEL-MMY-2045.

## Numbers analysed

Of the 190 subjects screened, 163 subjects [85.8% mITT] were enrolled and treated and 27 subjects [14.2%] were not treated.

Of 163 subjects treated, 77 subjects (47.2%) completed 8 cycles of treatment according to the drug administration data (at least 1 dose administrated in each cycle) and 86 subjects (52.8%) terminated before Cycle 8: 40 subjects [24.5%] due to drug-related AEs, 15 subjects [9.2%] due to PD, 9 subjects [5.5%] withdrew consent, 8 subjects [4.9%] due to death, 6 subjects [3.7%] due to 'other' [not specified] reasons, 4 subjects [2.5%] due to investigator decision, 2 subjects [1.2%] due to CR/ PR, 1 subject [0.6%] due to SD with no randomization criteria, and 1 subject [0.6%], due to protocol violation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of the 86 subjects who terminated before Cycle 8, 82 subjects were in the non-randomized cohort, and 4 subjects were in the randomized cohort.

The mean duration (± standard deviation) of the study was 19.4 months (± 10.8) and the mean duration of follow-up was 15.4 months (± 10.0). The longest mean duration of the study was observed in the VDC arm (24.3 ± 12.6 months) as well as regards the follow-up (19.2 ± 11.9 months).

Not estimable due to the low number of responders

Overall response rates were calculated using the best response (CR, VGPR, PR) during the study and before the start of subsequent therapies for multiple myeloma i.e., follow-up assessments were taken into consideration.

The proportion of subjects with a one year survival since the start of treatment in the randomized cohort, non-randomized cohort and across all cohorts.

Abbreviations: CI = confidence intervals, CR = complete response, ITT = modified intent-to-treat, N = total number of subject in cohort(s), ORR = overall response rate, PR = partial response, VGPR = very good partial response, VD =    x        = dexamethasone+lenalidomide.

## Summary of main study(ies)

The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Table 8: Summary of Efficacy for trial MMY-3001

Title: A Randomized Controlled Study of DOXIL ® /CAELYX ®  (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection) and VELCADE ®  (bortezomib) or VELCADE Monotherapy for the Treatment of Relapsed Multiple Myeloma

## Protocol DOXIL-MMY-3001

Randomized, parallel-group, open-label, multicenter study conducted in men and women 18 years of age or older who had relapsed/progressive or refractory multiple myeloma and who had received at least 1 prior line of therapy. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either VELCADE monotherapy or VELCADE plus DOXIL/CAELYX for up to 8 (21-day) cycles (more cycles could be given if it was considered that continued treatment would be beneficial) and were subsequently followed for survival.

One interim analysis was prospectively defined after approximately 230 events (progression or death due to progression) were observed; the final analysis was to be done after approximately 460 events.

Responses and progressions were assessed objectively by a computer algorithm based on the EBMT

| Design             | Randomized, open-label, international, multicenter, Phase 2 study of adult men and women subjects, who were refractory to or had relapsed or progressed after their primary therapy for multiple myeloma. All enrolled subjects initially received up to 4 cycles of VELCADE plus dexamethasone (VD). Following non-randomized treatment period, subjects who achieved a complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) continued to receive VD for a maximum of 4 additional cycles. Subjects with stable disease were randomized to receive up to 4 additional cycles of treatment with either VD, VD plus cyclophosphamide (VDC) or VD plus lenalidomide (VDL). Subjects with progressive disease (PD) were taken off study treatment. Treated subjects were followed-up for relapse and survival status. | Randomized, open-label, international, multicenter, Phase 2 study of adult men and women subjects, who were refractory to or had relapsed or progressed after their primary therapy for multiple myeloma.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

In order to provide further evidence in support of the benefit of VELCADE in combination with dexamethasone in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, the MAH has performed a matched pair analysis in which the outcomes of subjects in the VELCADE-dexamethasone group from Study MMY2045 were compared to the outcomes of a systematically matched control group of subjects from the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

VELCADE monotherapy groups of the APEX study (Study M34101-039, Phase III study of bortezomib compared with high dose dexamethasone for patients with relapsed myeloma (1 to 3 prior therapies) submitted at the time of initial marketing authorisation) and of Study MMY-3001.

The MAH conducted sensitivity analysis including 8 variables that were identified from a review of the literature as being related to clinical outcome in the matching algorithm: age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, type of myeloma, percent of plasma cells, prior dexamethasone, hemoglobin, creatinine clearance, and albumin.

Using this matching algorithm, 127 pairs were identified, corresponding to approximately 90% of the 142 subjects from Study MMY-2045.

Most of the baseline prognostic factors included in this sensitivity analysis were well balanced within the 127 matched pairs. Some imbalance was noted for age, ECOG score, and type of myeloma, with the imbalance favouring the VELCADE monotherapy group in each case.

At baseline, 42.5% of subjects had &gt;30% plasma cells present in the bone marrow aspirate or biopsy, 23.2% had a creatinine clearance of &lt;50 mL/min, and 70.5% had prior exposure to dexamethasone. The median baseline hemoglobin was 111.0 g/L; albumin was 3.9 g/dL.

## Overall Response Rate

The odds ratio (95% CI) of achieving a response for VELCADE plus dexamethasone versus VELCADE monotherapy was 3.769 (2.045, 6.947); p&lt;0.001 (Table 10).

## Supportive study MMY-3021 for the combination with dexamethasone

## Methods

Study MMY-3021 was a randomized, open-label, Phase 3, non-inferiority study that compared the safety and efficacy of VELCADE administered by either the IV and SC route in 222 subjects with progressive disease who had received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy (previous treatment with Velcade was an exclusion criterion) and had measurable disease and evidence of disease progression since their last previous therapy for multiple myeloma.

Subjects were adults with Karnofsky performance scores ≥70% and no prior Velcade exposure. Subjects were eligible to participate whether they had received or did not receive a prior stem cell transplant; at baseline 23% (51 patients) of total subjects had stem cell transplantation.

They were randomized in a 2:1 (SC:IV) ratio to receive either SC or IV Velcade 1.3 mg/m 2  on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each 3 week cycle. Dexamethasone 20 mg orally on the day of and day after each Velcade dose could be added for subjects who had no change or a PR, but had not progressed, after 4 cycles of treatment with Velcade monotherapy.

The primary endpoint was to compare the ORR, defined as the proportion of subjects with CR or PR after 4 cycles of VELCADE SC and IV. Non-inferiority was defined as retaining 60% of the IV (active control) treatment effect as measured by ORR.

Secondary endpoints considered in the present variation were CR, near complete response (nCR), and very good partial response (VGPR) rates after 4 cycles of single-agent VELCADE, the ORR after 8 cycles including the effect of adding dexamethasone, the duration of response, TTP, PFS, 1-year survival, and time to response following VELCADE treatment, administered either SC or IV.

Under the alternative hypothesis where the ORRs are both assumed to be 35.5%, which is the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the pooled response rate, and assuming a 1-sided alpha level of 0.025 and approximately 80% power, approximately 216 subjects (144 in the SC treatment group and 72 in the IV treatment group) were needed to show non-inferiority of SC to IV VELCADE.

## Results

147 subjects in the SC treatment group and 74 subjects in the IV treatment group were included in the safety analysis dataset. 121 subjects received Velcade-Dexamethasone (82 in the SC arm and 39 in the IV arm), and 32 subjects received Velcade monotherapy during the period after Cycle 4 when dexamethasone was allowed. Both groups of subjects received a median of 8 cycles of Velcade.

The following parameters were similar in the Velcade monotherapy and Velcade-Dexamethasone arms, respectively:

- Median time on study: 22.86 weeks vs 22.71 weeks
- Median VELCADE dose intensity (Cycles 1 to 4): 5.20 mg/m 2 /cycle vs 5.13 mg/m 2 /cycle
- Median VELCADE dose intensity (Cycles ≥5): 4.80 mg/m 2 /cycle vs 4.88 mg/m 2 /cycle
- Median VELCADE relative dose intensity (Cycles 1 to 4): 1.00 mg/m 2 /cycle vs 0.99 mg/m 2 /cycle
- Median VELCADE relative dose intensity (Cycles ≥5): 0.92 mg/m 2 /cycle vs 0.94 mg/m 2 /cycle

The median dose intensity of dexamethasone in the Velcade-Dexamethasone group was 160 mg/cycle.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Thirty-five (16%) subjects discontinued treatment due to disease progression. Forty-nine (22%) subjects discontinued due to an adverse event, 39 (18%) subjects discontinued due to a drug-related adverse event.

Results presented here focus on the period after cycle 4 when dexamethasone was permitted to be added to Velcade.

Crossreference:(bortezomib\\0020Mod5.3.5.1MMY-3021\\Table34)

Comparing the response before (Velcade monotherapy) and after (Velcade-Dexamethasone) cycle 4, the addition of dexamethasone from Cycle 5 onward improved the ORR (CR+PR) from 42% at the end of Cycle 4 to 52% at the end of Cycle 8.

Compared with the responses seen after 4 cycles of Velcade monotherapy, for subjects who received treatment with additional dexamethasone, 30% of subjects (in both SC and IV arms) who were initially non-responders improved to a PR, and 13% of subjects (in both SC and IV arms) with a PR improved to a CR.

For the 121 subjects who received additional dexamethasone after Cycle 4, the following time to event endpoints were observed: TTP (median 10.4 months [316 days]), PFS (10.2 months [310 days]), and 1-year survival rate (86%). The results for these endpoints in the subgroup of 101 subjects in the Velcade monotherapy group were 7.3 months (221 days), 6.2 months (189 days), and 58.9%, respectively.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

Study MMY-3001, designed to compare the most active treatment (Velcade) vs the combination (Velcade-Caelyx), is considered adequate to support the proposed indication of Velcade in combination with pegylated liposomal-doxorubicin for the treatment of progressive multiple myeloma in patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for bone marrow transplantation. The same indication was already approved in 2007 for Caelyx.

Final survival data for study MMY-3001 will be available at the end of 2013 when the protocol-required events (517 deaths) are expected. The CHMP recommended that results of the long-term follow-up and survival analysis of study MMY-3001 be submitted when available.

The MAH also proposed to extend the indication to treatment of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma which would allow the possibility of early treatment in patients with only relapse, but no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

further progression. This was not considered acceptable as not supported by data. In addition, the MAH also proposed to remove the restriction to ' patients who have already undergone or are unsuitable for bone marrow transplantation' on the basis of the inclusion of subjects who had either received or had not received a prior bone marrow transplant into Studies MMY-3001, MMY-2045, and MMY-3021. This was not agreed since no formal analysis was performed to demonstrate the effect of Velcade-Caelyx in the general patient population independently of a prior bone marrow transplant. During the assessment, the MAH did no longer pursue with these proposed changes.

Study MMY-2045 was also submitted to support the use of Velcade in combination with dexamethasone. Due to the non-comparative design of the study, the assessment of the efficacy of the combination Velcade-Dexamethasone has intrinsic limitations.

The combination Velcade-Dexamethasone obtained an ORR (CR, VGPR, PR) of 65.6% across all cohorts and 70.1% in the non-randomized Velcade-Dexamethasone cohort. These are substantially higher response rates compared to the Velcade monotherapy group of Study MMY-3001 (43%), and to the previous, controlled Velcade monotherapy (APEX) study (38%).

In the Velcade-Dexamethasone group of Study MMY-2045, the median TTP (12.0 months), PFS (10.2 months), and duration of overall response (11.3 months) extended beyond the median treatment period of 4.8 months even if a high number of censored were recorded (50% and 41%, respectively). These results appear significantly better than in Study MMY-3001 or APEX.

However, in view of the different study designs and study populations of these studies, such comparisons are not completely appropriate. In fact, in study MMY-2045, 99% of subjects had received just one prior line of therapy for MM and 41% had undergone stem cell transplant. In study MMY-3001, 66% of subjects had received more than one prior line of therapy for MM and 54% had undergone stem cell transplant. In the APEX trial 60% of subjects had received more than one prior line of therapy for MM and 67% had undergone stem cell transplant.

Direct assessment of the possible beneficial effect of bortezomib + dexamethasone compared to bortezomib alone from the results of the study MMY-2045 is not possible, as this was not the objective of the study.

Results from Study MMY-3021 are consistent with a higher efficacy of the combination relative to Velcade monotherapy but can only be considered supportive. While the ORR after 8 cycles (including the effect of adding dexamethasone) was one of the secondary objectives of the study, the direct assessment of the possibly beneficial effect of bortezomib + dexamethasone vs. bortezomib alone from the results of the study MMY-3021 was not possible. The reason is that the addition of dexamethasone was only possible after cycle 4. Although the addition of dexamethasone from cycle 5 onward improved the ORR, this improvement of ORR could also attribute to the increased number of bortezomib cycles.

In order to provide further evidence in support of the benefit of VELCADE in combination with dexamethasone, the MAH has performed matched pair analyses in which the outcomes of subjects in the VELCADE-dexamethasone group from Study MMY-2045 were compared to the outcomes of a systematically matched control group of subjects from the VELCADE monotherapy groups of the APEX study and of Study MMY-3001. The analysis conducted with 127 pairs selected based on appropriate covariates showed PFS results favouring the Velcade-dexamethasone treatment group [10.7 vs 6.2 months HR: 0.511(0.309-0.845) p=0.008]. Similar results favouring the Velcade-dexamethasone combination were also observed for the other endpoints that were evaluated.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Data from study MMY-3001 are considered adequate to support the proposed indication of Velcade in combination with pegylated liposomal-doxorubicin.

Results of study MMY-2045 supported by those of study MMY-3021 as well as the matched pair analyses support the use of Velcade in combination with dexamethasone.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

The MAH presented integrated safety population data from Study MMY-3001 and Study MMY-2045. The report included data on 799 subjects, of whom 481 received Velcade combination therapy (318 Velcade-Caelyx and 163 Velcade-Dexamethasone) and 318 received Velcade monotherapy.

Safety data from Study MMY-3021 for subjects who received treatment beginning in Cycle 5 and beyond (i.e., when dexamethasone was allowed) were considered supportive and presented separately.

The integrated safety analyses were carried out on the safety population, which included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of any study drug. All data summaries are presented in 4 groups: Velcade monotherapy, Velcade-Caelyx, Velcade-Dexamethasone, and the combined Velcade combination therapy group (referred to as the \"combined therapy group\") that included subjects who received Velcade-Caelyx and those who received Velcade-Dexamethasone.

The safety data for Studies MMY-3001 and MMY-3021 are from the updated safety reports with clinical cutoff dates of 28 November 2006 and 26 February 2011, respectively. The safety data for Study MMY2045 are from the final CSR with a clinical cutoff date of 2 August 2011.

At the time of clinical cutoff, almost all subjects (98%) from the key studies (MMY-3001 and MMY2045) had discontinued from treatment. The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation were adverse events (30%), completion of 8 cycles of treatment (27%), and disease progression (20%). At the time of the long-term extension clinical cutoff for Study MMY-3021, all 221 treated subjects had either completed the study (155 subjects [70%]) or discontinued from treatment (66 subjects [30%]).

## Patient exposure

Overall, 163 subjects in Study MMY-2045 were exposed to a total median (range) Velcade dose of 50.1 (2 to 92) mg or 26.2 (1 to 42) mg/m 2  during 8 cycles of treatment. The median duration (range) of exposure to Velcade was 145.0 (1 to 229) days over a median number (range) of 7 (1 to 8) cycles. Median (range) exposure to Velcade was 32.3 (2 to 46) mg or 18.4 (1 to 21) mg/m 2  during Cycles 1 to 4, and 26.4 (0 to 46) mg or 14.6 (1 to 21) mg/m 2 ) during Cycles 5 to 8. A total of 163 subjects were exposed to a total median (range) dexamethasone dose of 900.0 (20 to 1300) mg. Seven subjects were exposed to a total median (range) cyclophosphamide dose of 6000.0 (5000 to 6000) mg and four subjects were exposed to a total median (range) lenalidomide dose of 560 (450 to 560) mg.

A summary of patient exposure in Study MMY-3001 and Study MMY-2045 is presented in Table 15.

d For subjects that were indicated as discontinued due to AE on the treatment termination case report form page, some of the corresponding AE numbers were not available in the AE dataset; some of the corresponding AEs were not treatment-emergent per definition. These subjects are not included here.

e Includes subjects who had at least one adverse event that led to treatment discontinuation and was considered related to study drug.

Note: Percentages are calculated with the number of subjects in each group as denominator.

Note: In Study MMY-2045, for adverse events where only a severity grade is reported, the severity grade is remapped to a National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity grade.

In general, the overall safety profile was similar between the combined therapy and Velcade monotherapy groups. However, 98% of subjects who received combination therapy experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE).

The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in the following system organ classes (combined therapy group versus Velcade monotherapy):

- -Gastrointestinal Disorders (74% versus 73%): specifically, diarrhea (41% versus 39%), nausea (36% versus 40%, respectively), and constipation (31% in each group);
- -Nervous System Disorders (72% versus 70%): specifically, peripheral neuropathy(19% versus 26%), neuralgia (17% versus 20%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (15% versus 13%);
- -General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions (69% versus 62%): specifically, fatigue (32% versus 28%), pyrexia (25% versus 22%), and asthenia (22% versus 18%).

Peripheral oedema was reported in 17% of subjects in the Velcade+ Dexamethasone group and 5% of subjects in the Velcade monotherapy group.

Nervous System Disorders (particularly peripheral neuropathy) and Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders (particularly hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus) are recognized treatment-limiting toxicities associated with the use of Velcade. Therefore, a separate examination of these specific types of adverse events of clinical interest was undertaken. Overall, 50% of subjects in the combined therapy group and 52% of subjects in the Velcade monotherapy group experienced a Peripheral Neuropathy adverse event; in 11% and 14% of subjects, respectively, the adverse events were considered as Grade 3 or higher.

The incidence of Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders, specifically, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, was 5% in the combined therapy group 1% in the Velcade monotherapy group. The percentage of adverse events that were considered as Grade 3 or higher was &lt;1% in each group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

From the integrated safety population (Study MMY-3001 and Study MMY-2045) report, 56.5% of TEAEs in the Velcade-Dexamethasone group were of Grade 3-4 severity. This compares favourably with 68.9% in the Velcade monotherapy group.

The most frequently reported Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in the Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders system organ class (42% for the combined therapy and 35% for the Velcade monotherapy groups). Specifically, these included adverse events of neutropenia (23% versus 16%, respectively), thrombocytopenia (22% versus 17%, respectively), and anemia (9% in each group).

Grade 3 or higher peripheral neuropathy was observed in 11% in the combined therapy group and 14% of subjects in the Velcade monotherapy group.

The percentage of Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders that were considered as Grade 3 or higher was &lt;1% in each group.

The incidence of TEAEs leading to death (Grade 5) appeared to be somewhat higher with VelcadeDexamethasone (6.7%) than with Velcade monotherapy (0.3%).

The overall incidence of death was similar between the combination therapy and Velcade monotherapy groups (23% versus 25%, respectively). The most common cause of death was progressive disease (13% versus 20%, respectively). However, in the in the Velcade-dexamethasone group there was a higher incidence of deaths due to adverse events (Table 17).

*Vc monotherapy and Vc+DOXIL data in these columns are from Study MMY-3001

cCombined=Vc+DOXIL data plus Vc+Dex

## Laboratory findings

No significant hematologic or serum chemistry toxicities were identified with the use of the combination regimens. For most laboratory parameters, the percentage of subjects in the integrated analysis set who had hematologic or serum chemistry toxicities of Grade 0 to 2 at baseline that worsened to Grade 3-4 during treatment was similar between the combination therapy and VELCADE monotherapy groups.

## Safety in special populations

To evaluate potential differences in the safety profiles of the Velcade combination regimens within special patient populations, adverse events were analyzed by subgroups of subjects defined by age (&lt;65 versus ≥65), race (White versus non-White), and sex. The conclusion from this analysis was that the safety profiles within subgroups of subjects defined by age, race, and sex, were similar between the combined therapy and Velcade monotherapy groups and consistent with the overall study populations. Where there were differences between subjects who were ≥65 and &lt;65 years old, these were consistent with previous Velcade experience.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No drug-drug interaction and other interactions have been reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

The percentage of subjects that experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event that resulted in a dose adjustment of any study drug was 45% in the combined therapy group and 31% in the Velcade monotherapy group. Most commonly this was for Nervous System Disorders (26% in the combined therapy group and 23% in the Velcade monotherapy group).

Peripheral neuropathy was the most common treatment-emergent adverse event that led to a permanent stop of any study drug in all treatment groups. In the Velcade-Dexamethasone group, 4% of subjects also had a permanent stop of study drug for polyneuropathy.

Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome resulted in a permanent stop of study drug in 6% of subjects in the Velcade-DOXIL group; the only group with subjects who had a permanent stop of drug for this reason.

## Supportive Safety data from Study MMY-3021

The safety database from Study MMY-3021 submitted to support the use of Velcade in combination with dexamethasone included 121 (55% out of 221) subjects who received dexamethasone add-on after Cycle 4 (82 in the SC arm and 39 in the IV arm) and 32 received Velcade single agent. Patients who were allowed to be given dexamethasone after cycle 4 had no change or a PR and were without progression disease.

After cycle 4, the safety profile was similar between the treatment groups (also including Grade 3 or higher AEs), with the exception of serious treatment-emergent adverse events being higher in Vc+Dex group (16% [19 of 121 subjects]) than in the VELCADE monotherapy group (6% [2 of 32 subjects]).

The higher incidence of serious adverse events in the Vc+Dex group was primarily due to pneumonia (in 6 of 121 subjects, 5%). Other most frequently reported Grade 3 or higher adverse events in the Vc+Dex and the VELCADE monotherapy groups, respectively, were neutropenia (3% versus 13%) and anemia (5% versus 0%). All other treatment-emergent serious adverse events occurred at an incidence of 3% or less.

The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were similar (≤10% difference) between the Vc+Dex and the VELCADE monotherapy groups (16% versus 13%, respectively), despite the large difference in the number of subjects between the 2 groups (121 versus 32).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most common adverse events that resulted in treatment discontinuation in the VelcadeDexamethasone group were peripheral sensory neuropathy and thrombocytopenia; each occurred in 6% of subjects.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

As expected, the toxicity profile of the combination Velcade-Caelyx was worse than that of bortezomib monotherapy. Twenty per cent of subjects discontinued study treatment in the bortezomib arm due to adverse events compared to 27% of subjects in the Caelyx-bortezomib arm.

However, toxicities observed within the Caelyx-bortezomib combination group were predictable, manageable, and consistent with the known safety profiles of both agents. No unexpected safety concerns were observed.

Dose reductions of bortezomib were required for 35% of subjects in the monotherapy group, compared with 39% of subjects in the combined group.

The safety profile of the Velcade-Caelyx combination at the time of the clinical cut-off of study MMY3001 is confirmed by the post-marketing data collected since 2007.

With regard to the combination of Velcade and dexamethasone, the same limitations highlighted during the discussion of clinical efficacy partly apply to the discussion of clinical safety. These limitations relate to the non-comparative design of the MMY-2045 study and different characteristics of patient populations. Direct assessment of the possibly increased toxicity of Vc+ Dex compared to Vc alone is therefore not possible based on this study.

As expected, peripheral oedema, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, common side effects of dexamethasone, were more frequent in the Velcade-Dexamethasone group of Study MMY-2045 than in the Velcade monotherapy group of Study MMY-3001.

No excess deaths were recorded between combination therapy and Velcade monotherapy groups (23% versus 25%, respectively). The most common cause of death was progressive disease (13% versus 20%, respectively). However, in the Velcade-Dexamethasone group there was a higher incidence of deaths due to adverse events. This was possibly attributable to the fact that patients in the Velcadedexamethasone group were older, had a worse ECOG score, a higher tumour burden and a worse prognosis.

Overall, the safety results described from the Vc + Dex combination seem to be in line compared to Vc alone.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

Based on this review, the adverse drug reactions observed with the combination treatment regimens were consistent with the known safety profiles of each drug administered in monotherapy. Section 4.8 of the SmPC is updated to reflect the safety database considered in this application.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of these new indications, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

The CHMP agreed with the following indication. Section 4.1 of the SmPC has been amended accordingly:

VELCADE as monotherapy or in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

In addition, Annex II has been modified to add the key elements with regards to the induction transplant regimens to minimise the risk of medication errors.

No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a bridging report making reference to other tested versions of the Velcade Package Leaflet. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable.

In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been updated.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The beneficial effect of the combination of Velcade and with pegylated liposomal-doxorubicin for the treatment of progressive multiple myeloma in patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is supported by data from Study MMY-3001. A protocol defined interim analysis (based on 249 TTP events) triggered early study termination for efficacy. This interim analysis showed a TTP risk reduction of 45 % (95 % CI; 29 57 %, p &lt; 0.0001) for patients treated with combination therapy of VELCADE and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. The median TTP was 6.5 months for the VELCADE monotherapy patients compared with 9.3 months for the VELCADE plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination therapy patients. These results, though not mature, constituted the protocol defined final analysis.

Results from the Phase 2 study MMY-2045 showed a higher ORR (mainly VGPR) at cycle 4 in 70% of patients receiving the Velcade-dexamethasone group (n=144) compared to those patients who were randomised at cycle 5 to Velcade-dexamethasone plus other agents.

The positive trend in favour of Velcade-dexamethasone group (n=121) was confirmed by the supportive study MMY-3021 showing a higher ORR recorded from cycle 5 onward compared to dexamethsone monotherapy by cycle 4 (n=101). However in this latter study, the addition of dexamethasone was allowed only after 4 cycles.

The trend of an higher efficacy of the combination regimen vs Velcade monotherapy was further confirmed by matched pair analyses comparing the Velcade-dexamethasone treatment (study MMY2045), and the Velcade single agent therapy (studies APEX and MMY-3001). The matched pair analyss with 127 pairs showed improved ORR (CR+PR) (odds ratio 3.769; 95% CI 2.045-6.947; p &lt; 0.001), PFS (hazard ratio 0.511; 95% CI 0.309 0.845; p=0.008), TTP (hazard ratio 0.385; 95% CI 0.212 0.698; p=0.001) for VELCADE in combination with dexamethasone over VELCADE monotherapy.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

No formal evaluations of the clinical pharmacology and dose finding of Velcade in combination with Caelyx or dexamethasone have been performed.

No direct comparison has been submitted between Velcade and Velcade-dexamethasone in the claimed indication. In addition, pitfalls in the design of study MMY-3021 do not allow to exclude that improvement of ORR in Velcade-dexamethasone group is due to the increased number of Velcade cycles since dexamethasone was allowed only from cycle 5 onwards. However, supportive evidence was provided in a matched pair analysis based on appropriate covariate selection.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

As expected the toxicity profile of the two combinations was higher than when bortezomib was given alone.

Toxicities observed within the Caelyx-bortezomib combination group were predictable, manageable, and consistent with the known safety profiles of both agents. At the time of the clinical data collection

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cut-off date on April 2006, 12% subjects had died in the Bortezomib monotherapy arm compared with 9% of deaths in the Caelyx-bortezomib combination arm.

The addition of dexamethasone did not exacerbate the adverse effects of Velcade, but exerted its own characteristic side effects. In particular, it was shown to precipitate hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus and facilitate the development of infections, particularly pneumonia that was the most common treatment-emergent serious adverse event reported in 5% of subjects in the Velcade-Dexamethasone group in study MMY-3021. The overall frequency of Grade 3 and 4 treatment-emergent adverse events in Study MMY-2045 was high, but not higher than the Velcade monotherapy arm of Study MMY-3001.

In the Velcade-dexamethasone group there was a higher incidence of deaths (33.7% vs 25.2%); this was confirmed by the matched pair analysis on 127 pairs (33.9% vs 31.5%). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events leading to death (Grade 5) was higher for the combination of Velcade-dexamethasone compared to Velcade monotherapy. This was possibly attributable to the fact that patients in the Velcade-dexamethasone group were older, had a worse ECOG score, a higher tumour burden and a worse prognosis.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

No uncertainties about the side effect profile of the combinations Velcade-Caelyx and Velcadedexamethasone emerged from the submitted studies.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

As regard the combination Velcade-Caelyx the strength of the evidence in favour of efficacy is considered sufficient to support the proposed extension ofindication. Similarly the safety profile is considered well characterized and overall manageable thus allowing a positive evaluation of this combination therapy.

Regarding the combination Velcade-dexamethasone, it cannot be excluded that a bias in the recruitment of patients due to the non randomised nature of study MMY-2045 might have resulted in the selection of a patient population more prone to benefit from the combination therapy (e.g. less pre-treated patients, with more sensitive disease, eligible to stem cell transplantation). This could have incorrectly amplified the magnitude of the effect of the combination treatment. However, supportive evidence was provided in a matched pair analysis based on appropriate covariate selection.

No exacerbation of the adverse effects of Velcade was observed with the addition of dexamethasone which exerted its own characteristic side effects which summed up to those of Velcade. The combination with dexamethasone was associated with a risk of developing fatal complications, particularly pneumonia. However, the heterogeneous nature of causes of death do not point to a specific toxicity of the combination treatment. Most of the deaths were registered more than 30 days after the last dose of Velcade, thus the combination therapy does not seem to increase the risk of death during the treatment or shortly after.

## Benefit-risk balance

In both combination treatments, Velcade-Caelyx and Velcade-dexamethasone the efficacy is considered demonstrated and the safety profile sufficiently characterised and manageable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

The overall B/R of Velcade in combination with pegylated liposomal-doxorubicin or dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with progressive multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is positive.
