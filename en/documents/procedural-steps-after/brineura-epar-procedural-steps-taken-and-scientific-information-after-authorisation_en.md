1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

3  SmPC (Summary of Product Characteristics), Annex II, Labelling, PL (Package Leaflet).

An in-depth assessment of the totality of the data is needed at the time of submission of the final CSR, especially an in-depth assessment for efficacy and safety data for those patients <2 years of age. This will include the appropriateness of the current dosing recommendations with regard to efficacy and safety in younger children (below the age of 3 years), taking the available PK data into consideration. A second renewal of the marketing authorisation is required due to unfulfilled SOB, i.e. an uncompleted post- authorisation efficacy study, study 190-203 |

As a result meningitis has been included in the SmPC as an adverse drug reaction with frequency 'not known'. Meningitis may present with the following symptoms: fever, headache, neck stiffness, light sensitivity, nausea, vomiting, and change in mental status. The signs and symptoms of device-related infections may not be apparent, therefore, cerebrospinal fluid samples should routinely be sent for testing to detect subclinical device infections. |
