## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Amgen Europe B.V. submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 4 November 2014 an application for a variation.

This application concerns the following medicinal product:

| Centrally authorised Medicinal product(s):   | International non-proprietary name   |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| For presentations: See Annex A               |                                      |

The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) applied for an extension of the indication for the treatment of adult patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) to include use in the first-line setting in combination with FOLFIRI. Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC.

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial updates throughout the PI.

The variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision CW/1/2011 on the granting of a class waiver.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

The applicant did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Panitumumab, a recombinant fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody, binds with high affinity and specificity to the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a transmembrane glycoprotein that is a member of a subfamily of type I receptor tyrosine kinases.  EGFR promotes cell growth in normal epithelial tissues and is expressed on a variety of tumour cells.

Panitumumab binds to the ligand binding domain of EGFR and inhibits receptor autophosphorylation induced by all known EGFR ligands.  Binding of panitumumab to EGFR results in internalisation of the receptor, inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, decreased interleukin 8 (IL-8) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production.  KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homologue) and NRAS (Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homologue) are highly related members of the RAS oncogene family. KRAS and NRAS genes encode small, GTP-binding proteins involved in signal transduction. A variety of stimuli, including that from the EGFR, activate KRAS and NRAS which in turn stimulate other intracellular proteins to promote cell proliferation, cell survival and angiogenesis. Activating mutations in the RAS genes occur frequently in a variety of human tumours and have been implicated in both oncogenesis and tumour progression.

Vectibix (panitumumab) was first authorised in the EU on 3 December 2007.  Based on available data at the time of the application, panitumumab was granted a conditional marketing authorisation.

Vectibix is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC):

- in first-line in combination with FOLFOX
- in second-line in combination with FOLFIRI for patients who have received first-line fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (excluding irinotecan)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- as monotherapy after failure of fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens.

The purpose of this variation is to add FOLFIRI as a possible chemotherapy in the first-line combination (first bullet point of the indication). The application is based on two studies:

- a predefined retrospective analysis of Study 20060314 (submitted in 2010) by RAS tumour status
- an investigator-sponsored study (PLANET) comparing FOLFIRI plus panitumumab and FOLFOX plus panitumumab in the first-line setting.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Since the pharmacologically active substance in Vectibix, panitumumab, is a monoclonal antibody, a sequence of amino acids and a protein, it is exempted from the requirement of providing an ERA as in accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP/SWP/4447/00), it is unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The combination of Vectibix with FOLFIRI in the second-line setting was approved based on the results of a Phase III trial (Study 20050181) comparing panitumumab plus FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI alone in 1186 patients (variation EMEA/H/C/000741/II/0017 approved on 10 November 2011).

Cumulative evidence supporting the use of panitumumab in combination with FOLFIRI for the treatment of patients with wild-type RAS mCRC in the first-line setting has been submitted by the MAH.

## GCP

The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The two main studies were conducted in the EU.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Main studies

2.4.1.1. Study Title:  A Single Arm Multicentre Phase II Study of Panitumumab in Combination With Irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/Leucovorin in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (study 20060314)

## Methods

Study 20060314 was a MAH-sponsored, Phase II, single-arm study of panitumumab plus FOLFIRI as first-line therapy in subjects with mCRC.

## Study participants

The study included patients with histologically or cytologically-confirmed and radiologically-measurable metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma. Patients were excluded if they received prior systemic therapy for the treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma, with the exception of adjuvant fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy given at least 6 months prior to enrolment. Patients with central nervous system metastases, or those with significant cardiovascular disease, were also excluded.

## Treatments

Subjects received panitumumab 6 mg/kg plus FOLFIRI every 2 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent; subjects with stabilization of tumour volume who were not appropriate for ongoing chemotherapy could continue to receive panitumumab alone.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to estimate the effect of RAS mutation status on ORR and other measures of efficacy in subjects treated with panitumumab in combination with FOLFIRI as first-line therapy for subjects with mCRC.

The secondary objective was to describe the effect of RAS mutation status on the safety profile of this combination therapy in the first-line setting.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was objective response rate. Secondary endpoints included disease control rate, duration of objective response, time to objective response, progression-free survival time, time to disease progression, duration of stable disease, time to treatment failure, time to disease relapse, resectability, overall survival time.

## Sample size

This study is a predefined supplemental biomarker analysis of study 20060314.

## Randomisation

As the study was a single arm study, the patients were not randomised.

## Blinding (masking)

The study was a single arm trial; therefore the patients were not blinded.

## Statistical methods

The objective response rate (ORR) by 17 weeks and over the entire study was to be reported by RAS or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

RAS/BRAF mutation status along with two-sided exact 95% confidence intervals for the Evaluable for Tumour Response Analysis Sets. Wilson's score method with continuity correction was to be used to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the difference between rates across RAS or RAS/BRAF mutation groups.

A logistic regression model was to be employed to estimate the effect of RAS or RAS/BRAF mutation status on ORR. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval using the Wald method were to be provided.

The analysis of all secondary efficacy endpoints was to be performed by RAS or RAS/BRAF mutation status for the Efficacy Analysis Sets or Evaluable for Tumour Response Analysis Sets as applicable.

## Results

## Outcomes and estimation

## Disposition of Subjects and Baseline Characteristics

A total of 154 subjects were enrolled in the study. Of the 154 enrolled subjects, 143 subjects (93%) were evaluable for RAS status, including 69 (45%) with wild-type RAS tumors and 74 (48%) with mutant RAS tumors.

Study Title:  An Open label Randomized, Multi-Center Exploratory Phase II Study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of Panitumumab with FOLFOX 4 Chemotherapy or Panitumumab with FOLFIRI Chemotherapy in Subjects with Wild-Type KRAS Colorectal Cancer and liver-only Metastases (PLANET)

## Methods

PLANET is an investigator-led (non-Amgen sponsored), Phase II, randomized, open-label study of panitumumab plus FOLFIRI and panitumumab plus FOLFOX as first-line treatment of liver-limited, wild-type KRAS exon 2 mCRC. The study is conducted by the Spanish Cooperative Group for Digestive Tumor Therapy

RAS

, n = 73

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

at 15 centres in Spain. It was initiated in May 2009 and is still ongoing; the cut-off date of the results submitted is 01 August 2013.

Figure 1: Study design

<!-- image -->

## Study participants

Eligible subjects were &gt; 18 years of age, with Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70% and wild-type KRAS exon 2 mCRC with synchronous or metachronous liver-only metastases deemed resectable or unresectable (including subjects who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumour at least 4 weeks before randomization), fulfilling one of the following criteria: ≥ 4 metastases; at least 1 metastasis &gt; 10 cm in diameter; or liver metastases technically not resectable (vascular compromise and/or location in which complete resection is impossible and/or 25% to 30% of healthy liver would not remain functional after resection).

## Treatments

Panitumumab 6 mg/kg plus FOLFIRI or FOLFOX4 was administered every 14 days for 4 to 8 cycles. Subjects with resectable disease were eligible for surgery, which was performed 4 to 6 weeks after the last chemotherapy dose, followed by adjuvant treatment.

Patients with R0 (tumour free margin, no evidence of microscopic or macroscopic residual disease) or R1 (positive microscopic tumour margins) received 6 cycles of adjuvant treatment and patients with R2 received adjuvant treatment until disease progression or resectability achieved. Subjects with stable disease or in whom resectability was not achieved received additional cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.

A resection analysis was performed among patients that underwent an R0 or R1 resection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Objectives

The primary objective of the study was to compare the ORR (per modified RECIST criteria Version 1.1) in the two treatment arms during the treatment period. Tumour assessments were performed by investigators 8-weekly during the treatment phase.

Secondary objectives were to evaluate other efficacy variables (proportions of tumours becoming resectable, DOR, TTR, PFS, OS), safety, and also to assess hypomagnesaemia as a predictor of efficacy. Exploratory objectives were to explore possible differences in outcomes according to other predictive biomarkers (eg, RAS mutations).

## Sample size

An objective response rate of at least 30% is commonly thought to be achievable in mCRC subjects with liver-only metastases treated in the 1stline with FOLFOX4 or FOLFIRI alone. The randomized two-arm phase II design by Simon, Wittes and Ellenberg was used to establish the sample size requirements. In order to have 90% probability of correctly selecting the better treatment when the difference in the true objective response rates is 15% or greater, 37 subjects per arm are required. Such a trial has at least 80% probability of correctly selecting the better treatment if the absolute difference in the true response rates is only 10%. Based on these requirements a total of 80 subjects will be randomized to the study, 40 to each treatment arm.

## Randomisation

Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio, with randomization stratified by prior adjuvant FOLFOX therapy and resectability of liver metastasis.

## Results

## Participant flow

Eighty patients were randomized; three of them did not take medication and were not included in the safety population. Of the 77 WT KRAS patients included in the safety population, 38 received panitumumab plus FOLFOX4 (Group A) and 39 panitumumab plus FOLFIRI (Group B) (Figure 2).

Thirty-seven patients of Group A and 36 patients of Group B had discontinued the treatment at the cut-off date. The most frequent reasons for panitumumab discontinuation were:

- disease progression: 13 (Group A) vs. 10 (Group B)
- treatment completed: 10 vs. 7, respectively
- investigator's decision: 3 vs. 11, respectively
- non-acceptable toxicity: 6 vs. 3, respectively

The most frequent reasons for chemotherapy discontinuation were:

- disease progression: 12 (Group A) vs. 10 (Group B)

- treatment completed: 10 vs. 8, respectively

- investigator's decision: 3 vs. 9, respectively

- non-acceptable toxicity: 7 vs. 2, respectively

The resection analysis population included 13 patients from Group A and 18 patients from Group B.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition, RAS status (mutations in KRAS exon 3 or 4; NRAS exon 2, 3 or 4) was determined in 64 (83.1%) patients of the safety population. Of those patients, 53 (82.8%) were identified as having tumours with non-mutated RAS : 27 patients of Group A and 26 patients of Group B.

## Efficacy

The main objective of this study was to determine the ORR over the entire panitumumab plus chemotherapy treatment period. Results of unconfirmed response are reported because surgery resection was performed in some patients before radiological response confirmation.

In the overall WT KRAS patient population, the ORR was 73.7% (95% CI: 59.7% to 87.7%) in Group A (P+FOLFOX4) and 66.7% (95% CI: 51.9% to 81.5%) in Group B (P+FOLFIRI).

In the WT RAS population, ORR was 77.8% (95% CI: 62.1% to 93.5%) in Group A and 73.1% (95% CI: 56.0% to 90.1%) in Group B, respectively. Among patients with mutated RAS , ORR was 50% (95% CI: 1% to 99%) in Group A and 57.1% (95% CI: 20.5% to 93.8%) in Group B.

Surgery resection of liver metastases was performed in 40 (52%) of the 77 patients included in the safety population: in 17 (44.7%) patients of Group A and in 23 (59.0%) patients of Group B. Hepatic resection rate defined as the proportion of patients with R0 or R1 resection was 40.3% for the safety population (31 patients, 77.5% for the whole resected population): 13 subjects in Group A (34.2%) and 18 in Group B (46.2%). Median time to resection was 7.1 months in Group A and 6.2 months in Group B (no significant difference). Regarding hepatic resection results in the WT RAS population, 25.9% (7 of 27) of patients of Group A and 53.8% (14 of 26) of patients of Group B presented R0 or R1 resection.

A summary of the results in the RAS WT population is presented in Table 3 and Figures 3 and 4.

## Supportive studies

Study 20080763 was a randomised, multicentre, open-label study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of panitumumab and cetuximab in subjects with previously treated, wild-type KRAS exon 2 mCRC. It showed that panitumumab was non inferior to cetuximab for OS; median OS was 10.4 months (95% CI: 9.4, 11.6) in the panitumumab arm and 10.0 months (95% CI: 9.3, 11.0) in the cetuximab arm.

The results of the two main studies previously described (20060314 and PLANET) are presented with those of other first-line studies supporting the use of panitumumab in the first line setting in combination with FOLFIRI (Table 4):

Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally comparable across studies: most patients were male (60-80%), median age 60-65 years, with colon as the primary tumour (60-70%) and ECOG stage 0-1. The exception was in the OPUS study were there were about as many females as male patients and as many rectal as colon tumours.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The rationale for expanding the indication for panitumumab to include use in first-line in combination with FOLFIRI includes evidence that the efficacy and safety of panitumumab has been demonstrated across lines of therapy with different chemotherapy backbones and appears very similar to that for cetuximab in these settings.

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The combination of panitumumab to FOLFIRI in the first-line setting has been studied in a Phase II single-arm trial and in a small investigator-sponsored trial comparing the combination of panitumumab to either FOLFIRI or FOLFOX. The latter trial was a superiority trial, which was only powered to detect a large difference between the two combinations. As these data cannot be considered pivotal, the MAH rationale is also based on the comparison of panitumumab with cetuximab, which has an indication for the combination with irinotecan-based chemotherapy in all treatment lines. This is because the two anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies have shown similar efficacy in a large head-to-head comparative trial in the third-line monotherapy setting. Therefore, the key efficacy results of all first-line combination studies for the two products in the RAS WT population have been presented to support this extension of indication.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The efficacy results (ORR and PFS) of panitumumab in the first-line setting are very similar regardless of the backbone chemotherapy as indicated by the outcomes of the pivotal trial 20050203 (with FOLFOX) and those of the single-arm trial 20060314 (with FOLFIRI): ORR of 59% and median PFS of 10-11 months.

The small PLANET trial comparing these two combinations in a population of patients with liver metastases only failed to detect any significant difference in ORR (73% with FOLFIRI vs. 78% with FOLFOX) but this could be expected given the study power. Of note, the reason for a higher rate of treatment discontinuations in the FOLFIRI arm due to investigator's decision is unclear. Nevertheless, median PFS and OS were broadly comparable and in line with those observed in a similar subset of patients from the pivotal FOLFOX combination trial (20050203). Taken together, these results suggest that the two combinations do not differ substantially.

The review of available data has shown that the efficacy of panitumumab and cetuximab in combination with FOLFIRI as first-line treatment for mCRC is similar. The positive benefit-risk of panitumumab with FOLFIRI has been established in previously treated wild-type RAS mCRC with Phase III Study 20050181.

Study 20060314 demonstrated the clinical benefit of panitumumab plus FOLFIRI in the first line setting in a Phase II uncontrolled study. The CRYSTAL study, which supported approval of the indication for cetuximab in combination with irinotecan-based chemotherapy, showed significant improvements in PFS and OS for cetuximab plus FOLFIRI vs FOLFIRI alone in a randomised Phase III trial. A cross-study comparison between Study 20060314 and the CRYSTAL study showed similar clinical outcomes in subjects with wild-type RAS mCRC. In Study 20060314 vs CRYSTAL, ORR was 58.8% vs 66.3%, and median PFS was 11.2 months vs 11.4 months, respectively.

The positive benefit-risk of panitumumab with FOLFOX in previously untreated wild-type RAS mCRC has been established with Phase III Study 20050203. The first-line PLANET study showed comparable efficacy for panitumumab plus FOLFIRI and panitumumab plus FOLFOX in subjects with wild-type RAS tumours and metastases limited to the liver only (PFS hazard ratio FOLFIRI arm vs FOLFOX arm = 0.86 [95% CI: 0.47, 1.56]; ORR = 73% vs 78% FOLFIRI vs FOLFOX arms). The median PFS (11.3 months) and OS (40.7 months) in subjects with liver-limited disease in Study 20050203 are similar to the median PFS (12.8 months) and OS (39.0 months) for subjects in the PLANET study who received panitumumab plus FOLFOX.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Together, these results suggest that the clinical benefit of panitumumab in combination with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI in the first line setting is consistent with the proposed labelling.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The comparison of the two panitumumab combinations (to FOLFOX and FOLFIRI) used as first line treatment in the PLANET trial and the cross-study comparison between the efficacy results of Study 20060314 with FOLFIRI and Study 20050203 with FOLFOX support the proposed extension of indication for the FOLFIRI combination.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

This Summary of Clinical Safety presents recent safety data from two studies of panitumumab in combination with FOLFIRI in the setting of first-line mCRC (Study 20060314 and PLANET study) and provides a qualitative comparison of data from these studies with previous key studies of panitumumab and cetuximab in first-line mCRC. In addition, the safety profile of the combination of panitumumab with FOLFIRI in the second-line setting (Study 20050181) has been summarised.

## Patient exposure

## Adverse events

The overall subject incidence of adverse events, grade 3/4 adverse events, and fatal events was similar across the studies evaluated, although limited data were available for the CRYSTAL study. The subject incidence of serious adverse events was higher in subjects with wild-type RAS mCRC receiving panitumumab plus FOLFIRI in Study 20060314 (58%) than in the other studies (22% to 43%), primarily due to a higher subject incidence of serious diarrhoea. The subject incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment varied between studies, but no consistent pattern based on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor type or chemotherapy backbone was observed.

NR: not reported

In Study 20060314, the most frequently reported adverse events ( ≥ 40%) in subjects with wild-type RAS mCRC were diarrhoea (80%), nausea (52%), dry skin (48%), and rash (41%), consistent with the known safety profile of EGFR inhibitors administered in combination with chemotherapy. Similar results were observed for the panitumumab plus FOLFIRI arm of the PLANET study, in which diarrhoea (65%), rash (65%), asthenia (58%), and mucosal inflammation (54%) were the most frequently reported events.

The adverse event profile of panitumumab plus FOLFIRI was also consistent with that of panitumumab plus FOLFOX in subjects with wild-type RAS mCRC in the first-line setting, with the exception of known differences based on chemotherapy backbone. In the panitumumab plus FOLFOX arm of the PLANET study, the most frequently reported adverse events were diarrhoea (74%), asthenia (70%), neurotoxicity (59%), mucosal inflammation (56%), neutropenia (52%), rash (48%), and constipation (48%). These adverse events were similar to those frequently observed in subjects receiving panitumumab plus FOLFOX in Study 20050203, which included diarrhoea (65%), neutropenia (62%), rash (55%), and nausea (46%).

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

Fatal adverse events were consistent with those observed in previous studies of EGFR inhibitors. In Study 20060314, fatal adverse events were reported in 3 subjects (4%) with wild-type RAS mCRC. The fatal adverse events were hepatic failure, intestinal obstruction, and septic shock (1 subject each). None of these events were considered related to panitumumab by the investigator.

In the PLANET study, fatal adverse events were reported for 1 subject (4%) in the panitumumab plus FOLFIRI arm (pulmonary embolism) and 1 subject (4%) in the panitumumab plus FOLFOX arm (pneumomediastinum). These events were not considered related to treatment by the investigator.

The subject incidence of fatal adverse events was similar across studies of panitumumab or cetuximab plus FOLFIRI or FOLFOX in subjects with wild-type RAS mCRC in the first-line setting, ranging from 3% to 5% (Table 7).

In Study 20060314, serious adverse events were reported in 40 subjects (58%) with wild-type RAS mCRC. The most frequent serious adverse events (≥ 5% of subjects) were diarrhoea (19%) and pulmonary embolism and vomiting (6% each).

The subject incidence of serious adverse events in subjects with wild-type RAS mCRC was higher in Study 20060314 (58%) than in the other studies of panitumumab or cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy in the first-line setting (22% to 43%). In particular, the incidence of serious diarrhoea was higher in Study 20060314 (19%) than in the PLANET study (no events of serious diarrhoea) or Study 20050203 (9% panitumumab plus FOLFOX). All but one event of serious diarrhoea in Study 20060314 resolved, and no subject discontinued panitumumab due to diarrhoea. No adverse event of serious diarrhoea was associated with acute renal failure. Diarrhoea is included in Section 4.4 Warnings and Precautions for Use and Section

## Adverse events of interest

In Study 20060314, 68 of 69 subjects (99%) with wild-type RAS mCRC experienced an adverse event of interest (Table 7). The most frequently reported adverse events of interest were skin toxicity (99%) and diarrhoea (80%). The types of events and incidence rates were consistent with those expected for an EGFR inhibitor in combination with FOLFIRI.

## Safety in the second-line setting

Study 20050181 was a phase III, multicenter, randomized, open-label, comparative study to evaluate the efficacy of panitumumab in combination with FOLFIRI chemotherapy relative to FOLFIRI alone as second-line treatment in subjects with mCRC.  Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive panitumumab as an intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose of 6 mg/kg plus FOLFIRI chemotherapy or FOLFIRI

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

alone every 14 days ± 3 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. This study supported the extension of indication of panitumumab in combination with FOLFIRI as second line treatment in mCRC (EMEA/H/C/000741/II/0017).

Nearly all subjects with wild-type RAS mCRC in both treatment arms had adverse events. Grade 3/4 adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to discontinuation of any study medication were more frequently reported in the panitumumab plus FOLFIRI arm compared with the FOLFIRI alone arm, and were consistent with the known safety profile of panitumumab added to a chemotherapy backbone. Subject incidences of grade 5 (fatal) adverse events were similar in the two treatment arms (Table 10).

The most frequently reported serious adverse event in both treatment arms was diarrhoea (6% panitumumab plus FOLFIRI and 4% FOLFIRI alone). No serious adverse event was reported with &gt;5% difference between treatment arms.

Fatal adverse events were reported in 8 subjects (4%) receiving panitumumab plus FOLFIRI and 13 subjects (6%) receiving FOLFIRI alone. Fatal adverse events occurring in more than a single subject in either treatment arm were ileus (1% panitumumab plus FOLFIRI and 0% FOLFIRI alone) and mCRC (0% and 1%).

The most frequently reported adverse events among subjects with wild-type RAS mCRC in the panitumumab plus FOLFIRI and FOLFIRI alone arms, respectively, were diarrhoea (69% and 57%), nausea (50% and 50%), fatigue (39% and 32%), and neutropenia (38% and 41%). Other frequently occurring adverse events reported for subjects in the panitumumab plus FOLFIRI arm included those known to be associated with panitumumab and other EGFR inhibitors, such as rash (54% and 8%), hypomagnesaemia (29% and 2%), and dermatitis acneiform (28% and 1%).

Adverse events of interest for panitumumab that differed by at least 5% between the panitumumab plus FOLFIRI and FOLFIRI alone arms were integument toxicities (95% and 52%), diarrhoea (69% and 57%), stomatitis/oral mucositis (46% and 27%), hypomagnesaemia (31% and 2%), pulmonary toxicity (24% and 19%), and hypocalcaemia (7% and &lt; 1%).

## Post marketing experience

For the reporting period of the last PSUR covering the period from 1 October 2013 to 30 March 2014 (EMEA/H/C/000741/PSUV/0062), the estimated exposure to panitumumab in the post-marketing setting was 4654 patient-years. Cumulatively, since the IBD through the end of the reporting period, the estimated exposure to panitumumab in the marketed setting was 46,104 patient-years. Over 6000 subjects have been exposed to panitumumab as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy in clinical studies.

As of 31 March 2014, Amgen received a cumulative total of 6392 adverse drug reactions from medically confirmed and unconfirmed spontaneous sources; 2445 of the 6392 were serious adverse drug reactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and 3947 were non-serious adverse drug reactions. In addition, a cumulative total of 902 serious adverse reactions were received from non-interventional post-marketing sources.

The most frequent spontaneously reported adverse drug reactions were from the System Organ Classes of Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (n = 2410), General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions (n = 661), and Gastrointestinal Disorders (n = 524). Overall, frequently reported adverse drug reactions such as rash (n = 533), skin toxicity (n = 204), skin reaction (n = 203), dermatitis acneiform (n = 195), diarrhoea (n = 133), pruritus (n = 133), erythema (n = 117), and paronychia (n = 111), were consistent with the known safety profile of panitumumab and its mechanism of action. Other adverse events such as fatigue (n = 47), general physical health deterioration (n = 26), sepsis (n = 12), and pneumonia (n = 7) would be expected in a patient population with underlying metastatic cancer.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The data from the two main trials in the first-line setting are consistent with the known safety profile of the combination. No conclusions can be drawn from certain differences observed between studies such as a lower SAE rate in general for the PLANET study compared with all other company-sponsored trials or the higher rate of serious diarrhoea in the first-line setting compared with the second-line setting for the combination of panitumumab with FOLFIRI. However these differences do not impact the known safety profile of the product.

In addition, the adverse events observed in combination with FOLFIRI in the post-marketing setting did not identify any new safety signals compared with those observed in clinical studies. The safety profile of panitumumab, including use in combination with FOLFIRI, is well established, and the risks are managed through the routine and additional risk minimization measures in the approved Risk Management Plan.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety of the combination of panitumumab with FOLFIRI has been well characterised from clinical trials and post-marketing experience. No new safety concern has arisen from the new data submitted.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The current Risk Management Plan (RMP) for panitumumab (version 14 dated 9 April 2014) covers its use in combination with FOLFIRI. With this proposed extension of the indication to include use of panitumumab in combination with FOLFIRI in the first-line setting, no new safety signals were identified and there were no new toxicities. No new risk minimisation measures are proposed and the risk-management system has not been modified, the justification for not updating the RMP with this variation application is considered acceptable.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated (new text underlined).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Vectibix is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC):

- in first-line in combination with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI.
- in second-line in combination with FOLFIRI for patients who have received first-line fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (excluding irinotecan).
- as monotherapy after failure of fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens.

[…]

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

## Combination with FOLFIRI

[…]

The efficacy of Vectibix in first-line in combination with FOLFIRI was evaluated in a single-arm study of 154 patients with the primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR). Other key endpoints included the progression-free survival (PFS), time to response, time to progression (TTP), and duration of response.

A predefined retrospective subset analysis of 143 patients of the 154 patients with wild-type KRAS (exon 2) mCRC was performed, where tumour samples from these patients were tested for additional RAS mutations. The incidence of these additional RAS mutations ( KRAS exons 3, 4 and NRAS exons 2, 3, 4) in the wild-type KRAS (exon 2) population was approximately 10%.

Results in patients with wild-type RAS mCRC and mutant RAS mCRC from the primary analysis are presented in the table below.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The benefit of the combination of panitumumab with FOLFIRI in the first-line therapy of RAS WT mCRC appears similar in a cross-study comparison to that of the combination with FOLFOX (ORR=59%, median PFS of 10-11 months). This finding is supported by a small trial comparing the two combinations and showing broadly comparable outcomes.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Although no pivotal trial (comparing the combination to FOLFIRI alone) has been conducted with this specific combination in the first line setting, a review of all trials with panitumumab and cetuximab supports that their efficacy is comparable across all lines of therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The most frequent adverse reactions due to the addition of panitumumab to FOLFIRI are skin toxicities, increased diarrhoea, and hypomagnesaemia; the occurrence of nausea, fatigue, and neutropenia, which are related to FOLFIRI, remains unchanged. The types of events and incidence rates are consistent with those expected for an EGFR inhibitor in combination with FOLFIRI.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The safety of the combination is well known as it is already administered in the second line setting. No new signal has been detected in the first-line trials.

Significant survival improvement has been demonstrated for panitumumab in combination with FOLFIRI in the second-line setting and with FOLFOX in the first-line setting. In the latter, comparable results were observed with FOLFIRI in a single-arm trial.

The safety profile of the combination is well-known and the toxicities are considered manageable.

## Benefit-risk balance

The benefit-risk balance of this combination is considered positive.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

In the EU, the choice of first-line backbone chemotherapy (FOLFIRI or FOLFOX) combined with anti-EGFR therapy is per clinician's choice. However, there is an additional benefit for the FOLFIRI combination compared to the FOLFOX combination, which is that the combination with FOLFIRI has never been shown to produce harmful effects in patients with RAS mutant tumours in stark contrast with the combination with FOLFOX.

The CHMP conclusion on the benefit-risk of this combination is further supported by the recent ESMO treatment guideline stating that 'all chemotherapy (FOLFOX/FOLFIRI)-antibody (note that this also includes bevacizumab) combination should be regarded as appropriate and the decision-making will be a complex surrogate, taking into account many clinical factors, as well as patient preferences' 3 . This recommendation is mainly based on the recent results of the US Intergroup CALGB/SWOG 80405 study, showing no difference between bevacizumab and cetuximab-based therapy in patients with RAS WT tumours 4 . The choice between FOLFOX and FOLFIRI (in combination with cetuximab or bevacizumab) was left to physician's preference and 73% of the patients received FOLFOX, which is in accordance with North-American practice. Therefore, the expected subgroup analysis between the two chemotherapies might be of limited value.The benefit-risk balance of panitumumab in the first-line treatment of adult patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in combination with FOLFIRI is considered positive.
