## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pegaspargase (centrally authorised product), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on anaphylactic shock from clinical trials, the literature and spontaneous reports, the PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing pegaspargase (centrally authorised product) should be amended to include anaphylactic shock in the list of adverse drug reactions. In addition, the PRAC recommended that the opportunity is taken to reclassify 'Toxic epidermal necrolysis' from the SOC Immune system disorders to the SOC Skin and subcutaneous system disorders.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pegaspargase (centrally authorised product) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pegaspargase (centrally authorised product) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
