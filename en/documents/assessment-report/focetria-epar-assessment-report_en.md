- The  CHMP  opinions  were  forwarded,  in  all  official  languages  of  the  European  Union,  to  the European Commission, which adopted the corresponding Decisions on 2 May 2007

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- On 23 July 2009 an opinion on a Type II variation on quality aspects (II-01) was adopted by the CHMP  to  up-date  manufacturing  specifications.  The  European  Commission  adopted  a  positive Commission Decision for variation II-01 on 12 August 2009.
- On  18  August  2009  an  interim  Opinion  on  a  rolling  review  (RR/01)  was  adopted  by  the ETF 2 /CHMP to include information supporting the paediatric use of Focetria.
- On  1  September  2009  an  interim  Opinion  on  a  rolling  review  (RR/02)  was  adopted  by  the ETF/CHMP to include a revision of the Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Plan to support a change on the pandemic strain vaccine composition to A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v like strain (X-179A).

The attack rate for the A(H1N1)v virus strain is expected to be higher than for recently circulating seasonal  strains  because  of  the  lower  levels  of  pre-existing  immunity  in  the  population.  Current estimates for the attack rate associated with the influenza A(H1N1)v virus over the first major wave of infection in 2009-10 vary from approximately 10-30 % in different geographical areas. As a result, the actual  numbers of clinically  apparent  infections,  cases  that  require  hospitalisation  and  deaths  in  the pandemic period is expected to be higher than in recent years for seasonal influenza. These estimates may change (upwards or downwards) during the course of the pandemic.

Medicinal product no longer authorised · On 1 September 2009 an interim Opinion on a rolling review (RR/03) has been adopted by the ETF/CHMP to include information on the drug substance to support a change on the pandemic strain vaccine composition to A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v like strain (X-179A). · On  21  September  2009  an  interim  Opinion  on  a  rolling  review  (RR/04)  was  adopted  by  the ETF/CHMP to include information on the drug product to support a change on the pandemic strain vaccine composition to A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v like strain (X-179A). · On 22 September 2009, Novartis submitted a variation (PU-05) to introduce the pandemic strain A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v like strain X-179. · On 24 September 2009, the CHMP adopted a positive Opinion on a variation (PU-05) to change the pandemic strain vaccine composition to A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v like strain (X-179A). 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 2.1. Introduction An influenza pandemic is a global outbreak of influenza disease that occurs when a type A influenza strain  to  which  most  or  all  humans  are  immunologically naïve emerges to cause clinically apparent illness, and then spreads easily from person to person worldwide In  April  2009,  a  new  strain  of  human  influenza A(H1N1)v was identified and characterised. On 11 June 2009 the WHO declared Phase 6 of the influenza pandemic. The declaration reflected sustained transmission of the virus from person to person in several WHO regions. WHO and other international agencies are calling the disease pandemic (H1N1)v 2009 .  For the virus the nomenclature influenza A(H1N1)v (where v indicates variant) has been chosen.

So far in this pandemic there has been a marked under-representation of infections in people over 65 years of age, who make up only 2% of reported cases.

2 EMEA Task Force

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  Europe, among the reported cases the cases tend to be young, the median age being 25 years in those  who acquired the infection during travel, and 13 years in those domestically infected. Nearly 80% of cases are in individuals under 30 years of age. Deaths have occurred in previously healthy subjects as well as in those with underlying conditions or pregnancy that would predispose them to complications  of  influenza.  For  more  information  about  the  known  clinical  features  of  the  disease caused  by  influenza  A(H1N1)v  virus  please  see  the  updated  Risk  Assessment  report  from  ECDC under:

http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/Documents/0908\\_Influenza\\_AH1N1\\_Risk\\_Assessment.pdf

Specific guidance has been developed for the fast track assessment procedure for pandemic influenza vaccines 3 ,  which  can  only  be  used  once  WHO/EU  have  officially  declared  the  pandemic  (WHO Phase 6). The procedure involves the submission and evaluation of a core pandemic dossier (mock-up) during  the  inter-pandemic  period,  followed  by  a  fast  track  assessment  of  the  data  for  replacing  the mock-up vaccine strain with the recommended pandemic strain as a variation to the MAA.

On 22 September 2009 Novartis applied for a variation in order to update to the composition of the strain of Focetria to A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v officially recommended by WHO and CHMP for the Pandemic Influenza.

Medicinal product no longer authorised This guidance is based on a Proof of Principle approach by which safety and immunogenicity data would be generated with mock-up vaccines containing subtypes of influenza A to which the majority of the population is naïve. These principles are based on: ¾ The immune responses to a specific mock-up vaccine containing a strain to which subjects within a specific age range were immunologically naïve is expected to predict responses to the same vaccine construct containing an alternative strain of the same subtype or an alternative subtype of influenza A in a comparable population. ¾ The safety data generated with a specific mock-up vaccine in clinical studies is expected to predict the safety profile observed with the same vaccine construct containing an alternative strain  of  the  same  subtype  or  an  alternative  subtype  of  influenza  A  in  a  comparable population. On  the  basis  of  these  assumptions  the  mock-up/core  dossier  construct  allows  for  insertion  of  the pandemic strain into a vaccine construct based on all the data obtained with the corresponding mockup  vaccine  together  with  specific  data  relating  to  the  pandemic  strain.  This  approach  rests  on  the premise  that  the  final  pandemic  vaccine  is  produced  in  the  same  way  (i.e.  with  regards  to  the formulation,  manufacturing  process  and  control  methods)  as  approved  for  the  mock-up  vaccine. Therefore the strain change variation contains mainly the quality data that are new and relevant for the pandemic influenza vaccine virus. Novartis  received  a  Marketing  Authorisation  (core  pandemic  dossier)  for  Focetria  in  line  with  the above  mentioned  guidance.  Focetria  is  a  pandemic  influenza  vaccine,  surface  antigen,  inactivated, adjuvanted  with  MF59C.1.  It  is  an  egg-derived,  monovalent  vaccine,  manufactured  with  the  same process and has the same adjuvant used for a nationally authorised seasonal influenza vaccine 'Fluad', a  trivalent  influenza  vaccine  licensed  in  12  EU  countries  through  a  Mutual  Recognition  Procedure (MRP). Focetria is indicated for prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation and for use in accordance with official guidance.

Focetria  is  based  on  a  the  proposed  new  strain,  A/California/7/2009  (H1N1)v  like  strain  (X179A), which  complies  with  the  WHO 4 and  CHMP 5 recommendations  for  the  emergent  novel  A(H1N1)v

influenza  vaccine  composition.  In  support  of  the  strain  change  to  A/California/07/2009  (H1N1)v, Novartis  submitted  quality  data  in  accordance  with  the  quality  requirements  for  a  novel  influenza A(H1N1)v vaccine, the Guideline On Dossier Structure And Content For Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Marketing Authorisation (CPMP/VEG/4717/03  Rev.  1)  and EMEA  fast  track procedure for community human influenza inactivated vaccines annual strain(s) (CHMP/BWP/99698/07).

The  same  manufacturing  process,  with  the  exception  of  strain-dependent  parameters,  and  safety precautions were applied to the production of H5N1 and A(H1N1)v, which includes the release and shelf-life  specifications. The MAH provided quality data in support of this variation to demonstrate that  the  vaccine  containing  A/California/07/2009  (H1N1)v  is  comparable  from  the  Quality  point  of view to the Mock-up containing H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Recently,  preliminary  data  on  immunogenicity  data  obtained  three  weeks  after  administration  of  a single dose of an investigational MF59 adjuvanted MDCK cell culture A(H1N1)v vaccine  to healthy adults  has  been  made  available.  The  results  suggest  a  good  immune  response  however  further assessment and additional data are necessary before drawing final conclusion. Data  from  ongoing  and  planned  clinical trials and  from  studies as specified in the  agreed pharmacovigilance/risk  management  plan  using  the  Focetria  vaccine  construct  with  the  influenza A(H1N1)v strain are reviewed on an ongoing basis. These studies will allow obtaining further safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data for the influenza A(H1N1)v  pandemic vaccine. The Focetria SPC summarises the existing clinical data and will be updated on an ongoing basis as new  data  are  submitted  from  the  ongoing  and  planned  clinical  studies  with  vaccine  containing  the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)v strain and/or the same vaccine constructs. 2.2 Quality aspects The quality section is divided into two parts of which chapter 3.2.1 describes quality characteristics pertaining to the initial Mock-up vaccine (developed with A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) NIBRG-14 and chapter 3.2.2. describes quality characteristics submitted in support of the strain change variation to introduce the new pandemic strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v like strain X179A. 2.2.1 Mock-up vaccine (A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) NIBRG-14) Introduction Focetria is manufactured with the same process and has the same adjuvant used for Fluad, a trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine nationally authorised through a MRP for several years in 12 EU countries and currently on the market. The MF59C.1 adjuvant contained in Focetria and Fluad is an oil-in-water emulsion,  composed  mainly  of  squalene  that  is  an  intermediate  metabolite  in  the  synthesis  of cholesterol.

The  formulation  proposed  for  Focetria,  selected  based  on  the  Clinical  Trials  performed  using pandemic strains, contains 7.5 µg HA of antigen/dose.  It is 6-times lower than the total amount of HA present in a conventional trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine, that is 15 µg HA per strain (or 45µg HA/dose).

The vaccine is presented as a suspension for injection in a pre-filled syringe (single dose) or in vials, single dose 6 or multi-dose. The vaccine in multi-dose vials is formulated with thiomersal.

## Active Substance

The Drug Substance is the Monovalent Pooled Harvest (MPH) of Pandemic Influenza vaccine, surface antigen, inactivated. It is a buffered suspension containing predominantly the purified outer membrane proteins,  Haemagglutinin  (HA)  and  Neuraminidase  (NA),  of  a  pandemic  influenza  virus  strain recommended by the WHO-EU for the Pandemic.

- Manufacture

Medicinal product no longer authorised The  manufacturing  process  of  Monovalent  Pool  Harvest  (MPH)  involves  the  cultivation  of  the pandemic  influenza virus strain in embryonated  chicken eggs, harvesting of allantoic fluid, concentration by ultrafiltration  and  formaldehyde inactivation, followed by whole virus purification using sucrose gradient centrifugation and diafiltration. The HA and NA antigens from the surface of the purified whole virus are solubilised by treatment with  a  detergent  cetyltrimethylammonium  bromide  (CTAB).  The  solubilised  antigens  are  then separated from  the non-solubilised components  of  the  virus by centrifugation. The  resultant supernatants  are  treated  with  polystyrene  based  resin  to  remove  CTAB.  The  polystyrene  resin  is removed by filtration and the resulting MPH is filter sterilised. Preparation and control of Virus Seeds The  reference  virus  for  the  mock-up  procedure  (H5N1  NIBRG-14)  was  manufactured  by  Reverse Genetics (RG) technology and provided by NIBSC, UK, an authorised WHO reference laboratory. According to Ph.Eur. the Working Seed (WS) is obtained after no more than 15 passages  from the approved reference virus. Aliquots of Master Seed (MS) are aseptically filled into sterile sealed vials, and stored in a freezer at a temperature lower than -60 o C. The WS is obtained after only one passage from the MS using SPF eggs. WS is QC tested and the vials are stored at a temperature lower than -60 o C. WS is tested for HA and NA identity, absence of mycoplasma, sterility, infectivity, HA titre and egg infectivity to assure identity and microbial quality. Virus cultivation The virus is grown in pre-incubated, candled, fertile hens eggs. The virus inoculum is prepared from the WS at a dilution calculated to ensure total egg infection and maximum virus yield and it is injected into  the  allantoic  cavity  of  each  production  egg.  After  inoculation,  the  eggs  are  incubated  at  an optimum temperature and time for maximum virus yield. After incubation, the eggs are cooled to 28°C and thereafter fed directly into the Harvesting room. Harvesting of Allantoic Fluid The allantoic fluid (AF) is collected into the harvesting vessel. The resultant fluid is then clarified by centrifugation, collected in a refrigerated tank, which is then connected to an ultrafiltration system to concentrate the allantoic fluid. Inactivation

An aqueous solution of formaldehyde is added to the clarified concentrated allantoic fluid. The content of the tank is then transferred to a sanitised and temperature controlled inactivation vessel and stirred throughout the inactivation period. The inactivation cycle depends upon the characteristics of specific virus strains. The inactivation temperature is selected in order not to compromise antigenicity.

## Purification

The virus is removed from the inactivated allantoic fluid using continuous flow ultracentrifuges. The virus is collected using a sucrose density gradient, which concentrates and purifies the virus through isopycnic centrifugation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The purified virus Pool is diluted with PBS and then diafiltered. A clarifying filtration takes place with pre-filters  and  filters  of  different  pore  sizes.  The  filtered  product  represents  the  Whole  Virus Concentrate,  and  it  is  sampled  for  testing.  A  Polysorbate  80  solution  is  added  to  the  Whole  Virus Concentrate and the product is stored waiting for the Split test results.

## Haemagglutinin and Neuraminidase solubilisation

Following the split test results, CTAB Solution is added to the Whole Virus Concentrate to solubilise the HA and NA antigens. The product is then centrifuged under continuous flow and the supernatant collected.

A polystyrene resin, is added to the Subunit Supernatant Pool to absorb the CTAB. Afterwards, the product undergoes a clarifying filtration to remove the resin, and a stabiliser solution is added and the product is then filtered into a stainless steel tank.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Filling, storage and transportation After the filtration described above, the monovalent pool is transferred to Rosia, where it is sampled for Bioburden, and sterile filtered into a sterile container. The Monovalent Pooled Harvest is sterile filtered.  The  filtered  Monovalent  Pooled  Harvest  (i.e.  the  active  substance)  is  sampled  for  release testing and stored at 2-8°C in a stainless steel tank. Process Validation and/or Evaluation Consistency of production was demonstrated by data provided on three H5N1 full-scale batches and further  supported  by  batch  analysis  results  of  the  inter-pandemic  vaccine  production  campaigns  of previous years. MPHs  are  manufactured  in  compliance  with  GMP  and  according  to  requirements  of  the  Ph.Eur. Studies  have  been  carried  out  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  antigen  production  process  to inactivate potential viral, bacterial and mycoplasma contamination in addition to influenza viruses. The formaldehyde inactivation step has been evaluated for three consecutive production egg harvests. The  optimum  quantities  of  polysorbate  80  and  of  CTAB  to  allow  complete  splitting  of  the  virus vaccine strain is determined in the QC laboratory, prior to application to production lots. The optimal conditions  are  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  electrophoresis  patterns,  the  haemagglutinin  and  the neuraminidase activity identified in the lots. Tests are performed to determine the levels of potential impurities, which may arise in Monovalent Pooled Harvest. Limits are applied to these impurities. Transportation between Novartis Siena and Rosia sites is carried out using validated procedures. Characterisation The  active  substance  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  monograph  for  Influenza  Vaccine,  Surface  Antigen, Inactivated. It is a sterile suspension containing predominantly the purified outer membranes proteins: HA and NA of the influenza virus strain. The crystal structure of HA has been determined to atomic resolution  for  the  native  HA,  for  the  HA  bound  to  a  number  of  different  receptor  analogues,  for proteolytic  fragments  of  HA  which  have  gone  through  the  conformational  changes  required  for mediating membrane fusion, and for HA complexed with neutralising antibody. Influenza  virus  NA  structure  has  been  determined  with  structural  studies  of  NA  in  complex  with specific monoclonal antibodies, by electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography amino acid sequencing and gene sequencing.

The  concentrations  of  potentially  contaminant  substances  (formaldehyde,  citrates  and  CTAB)  are controlled  during  the  process  or  in  the  MPH.  Limits  are  applied.  Polysorbate  80  is  also  used  as  an excipient of MF59C.1 adjuvant and is not considered as a residual of production but is nevertheless tested  on  the  MPH.  It  is  concluded  that  the  impurities  in  Focetria  active  substance  are  sufficiently controlled.

- Specifications

The  MPH  complies  with  the  Ph.Eur.  monograph  01/2006:0869  on  Influenza  Vaccine  (Surface Antigen, Inactivated).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  MPH  is  tested  for  release  for  Haemagglutinin  Identity  and  Content  (SRID),  Neuraminidase Identity (ELISA), Viral inactivation, Purity (SDS-PAGE), Sterility, CTAB, Polysorbate 80, Barium, Citrates, Endotoxin, Formaldehyde, Ovalbumin Content and Appearance.

Specifications have been selected to be as much as possible in accordance to the Ph.Eur. monograph for the influenza vaccine (surface antigen inactivated).

Specification  for  Haemagglutinin  identity  and  content,  Neuraminidase  Identity,  Viral  Inactivation, Purity, Sterility comply with Ph.Eur. for the Monovalent Bulk. A limit for Endotoxin and Ovalbumin is  set  up  on  the  Active  Substance  to  ensure  that  the  Ph.Eur.  specification  for  the  Final  Lot  (i.e. monovalent at 7.5 µg HA/dose) is met.

The  process  for  the  Final  Bulk  preparation  consists  is  a  simple  mixing  operation.  In  case  of formulation with preservative a Thiomersal solution is added. The formulated suspension is filled into syringes or vials. The potency of the vaccine is expressed as the concentration of the HA protein.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Due to the presence of the adjuvant in the finished product, the test for formaldehyde is performed on the Monovalent Pooled Harvest. Ovalbumin is also controlled on the active substance. The acceptance limits have been set to ensure that the Ph.Eur. limits for the finished product (i.e. monovalent at 7.5 µg HA/dose) are not exceeded. The concentrations of the other substances used during manufacture of the vaccine (i.e. CTAB, citrates, Polysorbate 80) are controlled in the active substance. The limit for the citrates  is  calculated  considering  the  content  of  HA  on  the  Final  Lot.  It  has  to  be  noted  that Polysorbate 80 is also used as an excipient of MF59C.1 adjuvant All  the  relevant  analytical  methods  have  been  validated  or  qualified  for  the  active  substance.  It  is acceptable that some analytical validations have been performed on the inter-pandemic strains, as the methods are not strain specific. · Stability The MAH has provided stability data up to 9 months for three full-scale batches of H5N1 Monovalent Pooled harvest as well as data collected with the inter-pandemic antigens produced in previous years. The data are consistent with shelf-life of 1 year for the active substance when stored at 2-8°C. The MAH committed to complete the stability study for H5N1 MPH. At least one batch of the MPH in its container will be stability tested. A stability protocol up to 24 months at 2-8°C was provided. The key stability-indicating parameter are the HA content and purity, measured with the same methods and acceptance limits used at release. Medicinal Product The  finished  product  is  a  combination  of  MPH,  MF59C.1  adjuvant  bulk  and  buffer  solutions.  The Mock-up  vaccine  application  is  based  on  the  H5N1  Reverse  Genetics  Strain  NIBRG  14,  which  is derived from the highly pathogenic avian influenza strain A/Vietnam/1194/2004. It should be noted that this mock-up vaccine will have to be varied to introduce the actual pandemic strain, as designated by WHO/EU, when the pandemic is declared. The  MF59C.1  adjuvant  is  an  oil-in-water  emulsion,  composed  mainly  of  squalene  that  is  an intermediate metabolite in the synthesis of cholesterol. Squalene is a commercially available natural product distilled from shark liver oil. It is then redistilled and supplied by qualified manufacturers.

The vaccine is presented as a suspension for injection in an emulsion in a pre-filled syringe (single dose)  or  in  vials,  single  dose 7 or  multi-dose.  Vaccine  in  multi-dose  vials  is  formulated  with Thiomersal.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Other Ingredients: Sodium chloride Potassium chloride Potassium dihydrogen phosphate Disodium phosphate dihydrate Magnesium chloride hexahydrate Calcium chloride dihydrate Thiomersal (included only in multi-dose vials) Sodium citrate Citric acid Water for injections · Pharmaceutical Development Focetria contains the same adjuvant and is manufactured with the same process used for Fluad. Fluad a surface antigen, trivalent inactivated, inter-pandemic influenza vaccine, adjuvanted with MF59C.1, is currently the only influenza vaccine with an adjuvant on the market, and has been approved in 2000 through a Mutual Recognition Procedure in 12 EU countries. Fluad is also licensed and marketed in other European countries and outside Europe. Formulation Development The  finished  product  is  a  combination  of  MPH,  MF59C.1  adjuvant  bulk  and  buffer  solutions.  The present core pandemic dossier describes the H5N1 mock-up vaccine. The MF59 adjuvant has been used in pre-clinical and clinical studies for a range of different vaccines. From the 1999 Fluad has been formulated using adjuvant containing citrate buffer to improve adjuvant stability, designated as MF59C.1. This formulation has been the one used for Focetria. Both the aqueous and citrate formulations of MF59 were used in preclinical and clinical studies. A clinical  study  has  been  successfully  completed  which  demonstrates  equivalence  between  the  citrate and water formulations of Fluad. Manufacturing Process Development The first production of Focetria with the H5N3 strain was in 1999. The manufacturing process was the same of the seasonal influenza vaccine Fluad. Successively, Focetria was produced with the H9N2 strain in 2004 and with the H5N1 strain in 2005, with the same manufacturing process approved for Fluad in 2005.

<!-- image -->

From 2000, some changes in formulation and manufacturing process were introduced for Fluad and approved through the relevant MRP variations. However these differences, as already demonstrated for the variations submitted for Fluad, do not affect the quality, safety and efficacy of the product. The same changes in the formulation and manufacturing process approved for FLUAD were submitted for Focetria mock-up variation and approved on 23 July 2009.

Thiomersal  was  previously  used  in  the  production  of  the  active  substance  (as  reagent  during  the process and as preservative at the final stage) and of the finished product (as preservative). Thiomersal was  removed  in  two  steps:  in  the  first  one  it  was  removed  from  the  active  substance  and  finished product as preservative (remaining as traces); in the second one it was removed completely (in 2003).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Clinical  trials  performed  to  compare  Fluad  formulations  (with  and  without  preservative)  and  of  the stability studies confirmed that the presence of Thiomersal, as a preservative in Fluad, does not have any  impact  on  the  quality,  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  the  product.  For  that  reason,  the  current licensed Fluad in pre-filled syringe is a thiomersal-free product.

Focetria with H5N3 strain was produced before 2003 with the preservative, while Focetria with H9N2 and H5N1 strains were produced in 2004 and 2005 without any preservative.

- Adventitious Agents

In addition to inactivation of influenza virus, the Ph.Eur., requires that the formaldehyde inactivation process be shown to be capable of inactivating avian leucosis viruses and mycoplasma. Studies have been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the antigen production process to inactivate potential viral, bacterial and mycoplasma contamination in addition to influenza viruses.

Medicinal product no longer authorised CTAB, as detergent, could contribute to virus inactivation. Its capacity to inactivate mycoplasma has been validated. Sucrose gradient centrifugation could contribute to virus removal as well as the centrifugation steps, which follow the Polysorbate 80/CTAB treatment. With respect to the transmission of TSE, the only animal derived starting materials are eggs (used in production  of  the  active  substance)  and  squalene  (used  in  the  MF59C.  1  adjuvant).  There  is  no scientific  evidence  to  suggest  that  eggs  are  likely  to  present  any  risk  of  contamination  from  TSEagents. Copy of the Declaration of compliance with the annex to Directive 75/ 318/ EEC, as amended by directive 1999/ 82/ EEC relating to TSE was submitted. Regarding squalene, derived from shark liver, it does not present any risk of potential contamination from TSE agents as well. With  regards  to  the  use  of  reverse  genetics  strains,  which  may  be  prepared  using  materials  from ruminant origin (foetal calf serum, bovine trypsin, Vero Cells), the TSE compliance was performed by NIBSC. · Manufacture of the Product Description of Manufacturing Process and Process Controls Final Bulk Vaccine Process The Buffer A, Solution B and Thiomersal solution are prepared in Rosia. The Monovalent Pools are prepared at the Siena facility and transported to Rosia where they are sterilised by filtration to produce the MPH. The MF59C.1 Adjuvant Bulk is received from the manufacturing site and is sterilised by filtration. The  components  are  added  to  the  Final  Bulk  container  (buffer  solution,  water  for  injection,  MPH, stabiliser solution and MF59). The required quantity of Thiomersal solution is only added in case of formulation with preservative. After the addition is completed, the bulk is stirred to allow adequate mixing.  The  pH  of  the  Final  Bulk  is  checked  and  samples  are  taken  for  Final  Bulk  release  control testing  [i.e.  HA  identity  and  content,  Endotoxin,  Total  protein  (other  than  HA),  Osmolality, Ovalbumin Content, Thiomersal (if appropriate)]. The Final Bulk is then aliquoted by aseptic transfer into sterile containers (each container is subsequently sampled and tested for sterility), and stored at 28 o C. The in-process controls are appropriate for the preparation of the Final bulk and of the Final Lot in its final container.

The adjuvant MF59C.1 is produced in Germany and transported to Italy, where it is filtered and used to formulate the Final Bulk. Bioburden is controlled before the sterilising filtration, while sterility and other in-process parameters are monitored after filtration and before the addition into the Final Bulk mixing tank.

## Filling and packaging Process (Final lot syringes and Final lot vials)

Filling operations are carried out at the Rosia manufacturing site. Syringes and vials are filled by a validated, aseptically procedure which is also registered for Fluad. The packed product is stored at 28 o C until released.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Product Specification

The  Final  Lot  is  tested  for  release  for  Haemagglutinin  Identity  and  Content  (SRID),  Sterility, Endotoxin,  Appearance,  Abnormal  toxicity,  Squalene  identity  and  content  (HPLC),  Particle  size distribution, pH, Thiomersal (only for multi-dose vials) and Extractable volume.

The  release  tests  are  the  same  approved  for  the  inter-pandemic  Fluad  vaccine  (except  for  the haemagglutinin content - 7.5 μ g/dose vs. 15 μ g for each strain/dose) and fulfil the Ph.Eur. requirements for surface antigen influenza vaccine.

.

With regard to the quality requirements for a novel influenza A(H1N1)v vaccine, the Guideline On Dossier Structure And Content For Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Marketing Authorisation (CPMP/VEG/4717/03  Rev.  1)  and EMEA  fast  track  procedure  for  community  human  influenza inactivated  vaccines  annual  strain(s) (CHMP/BWP/99698/07)  are  applicable.  The  same  quality requirements and safety precautions apply to production of H5N1 and A(H1N1)v.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The specifications might differ from the Ph.Eur. monograph for the influenza vaccine (surface antigen inactivated) due to the presence of the MF59C.1 that could interfere with some analytical methods. The specification for Haemagglutinin identity and content complies with Ph.Eur. for the Final Lot. In case  the  quantity  of  relevant  materials  to  carry  out  the  assay  is  insufficient  (a  real  possibility  in  a Pandemic emergency), this test will be performed only on the Final Bulk and will not be repeated in the final lot. The specifications for squalene content and identity and for particle size distribution are specific to control the MF59C.1 adjuvant into the vaccine. Thiomersal is controlled when it is used as a preservative in the Final Bulk formulation. The Test for free formaldehyde is performed earlier in the process, on the Monovalent Pooled Harvest, rather than on the Final Bulk vaccine or the Final Lot, as required by Ph.Eur.  The MF59C.1 adjuvant in the finished product interferes with the performance of this test. All the relevant analytical procedures have been validated or qualified for the finished product. All excipients used during production and in the formulation of Monovalent Pooled Harvest, MF59C.1 adjuvant and Final bulk Vaccine comply with Ph.Eur., except for squalene (in-house specifications). Batch analysis Batch  analysis  results  of  three  H5N1  full  production  scale  lots  show  consistent  production  and  are consistent with results obtained for the seasonal Fluad vaccine. · Stability of the Product Stability  data  for  the  pre-filled  syringes  of  Focetria  H5N1  are  provided  (3  full-scale  batches  for  9 months)  and  are  consistent  with  stability  results  of  the  seasonal  MRP  approved  Fluad  vaccine justifying the proposed shelf life of 1 year when stored at 2-8°C. The MAH committed to complete the stability study for pre-filled syringes as well as for mono-dose and multi-dose vials. The proposed shelf  life  for  the  adjuvant  MF59C.1  of  3  years  when  stored  at  2-8  °C  is  sufficiently supported by data. 2.2.2  Pandemic Strain Variation (A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v like strain (X179A))

The proposed influenza strain for Focetria is: A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v like strain (X-179A). This vaccine  strain  complies  with  the  WHO 8 and  CHMP 9 recommendations  for  the  emergent  novel A(H1N1)v influenza vaccine composition and therefore is accepted.

8 http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/swineflu/vaccine\\_recommendations/en/index.html

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH provided quality data in support of this variation to ensure that the manufacture of the drug substance and drug product is appropriately controlled. Adequate release and shelf-life specifications have been set.

## Active substance

Information is presented on the source and passage level history of the primary seed virus as well as on the preparation and qualification of the working seed virus lots for the strain.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The Primary virus Seed needed to produce the pandemic A(H1N1)v influenza vaccine was provided by a WHO authorised Reference Laboratory. The pandemic H1N1 virus seed was obtained using the conventional  reassortment  techniques.  The  Master  Seed  was  obtained  after  not  more  than  fourteen passages from the approved Primary Virus Strain by cultivation in the allantoic cavity of SPF eggs. The Working Seed is obtained after only one passage from the Master Seed. The production method as well all the in-process and release tests for Master and Working Seeds are unchanged  with  respect  to  the  previous  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  (H5N1)  and  are  in  compliance  with Ph.Eur. requirements. No  changes  have  been  applied  to  the  production  process  concerning  Working  Seed  growth  with respect to A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1). Process validation data (inactivation of virus particles and splitting efficiency) have been submitted for  three  batches.  Specific  inactivation  kinetic  studies  were  carried  out.  The  optimum  quantities  of polysorbate 80 and of CTAB to allow complete splitting of the X-179A strain were determined using the Split Test in the QC laboratory, prior to application to production lots. Satisfactory data are presented to demonstrate that the inactivation process is sufficiently validated. The MAH has demonstrated the effectiveness of the antigen production process to inactivate ALV and the Bovine Adenovirus Type III (BAV 3). The approved specifications for the drug substance have not been changed. Validation  studies  for  the  SRD  assay  were  performed  for  the  new  virus  strain  A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v  like  strain  (X-179A).  Sufficient  assay  validation  data  were  provided  to  assure  acceptable performance of SRD assay to quantify HA content in the monovalent bulk. Batch analysis results of monovalent pooled harvest (3 batches) were provided. All batches have been tested according to the approved specifications. The results of production batch analysis demonstrate reproducibility of the manufacturing process for the product.

Three batches of monovalent pooled harvest have been placed on stability. The proposed 12 month shelf life at 2-8°C for the A(H1N1)v monovalent pooled harvest is supported by extensive data from seasonal  H1N1  monovalent  pooled  harvests  and  H5N1  monovalent  pooled  harvests.  The  company committed to finalise the ongoing studies with A(H1N1)v strain and to report any unexpected results generated  during  the  ongoing  stability  studies,  in  case  of  a  confirmed  out-of-specification  or unexpected trend not supporting the registered shelf-life.

## Medicinal Product

The manufacturing process and quantitative composition of the drug product remain unchanged. Each 0.5 ml dose of vaccine has the following composition:

Thiomersal is included in multidose dose vials only. The approved specifications for final bulk and drug product have not been changed for the A(H1N1)v vaccine. Batch analysis results of final bulk and final containers (three commercial scale lots for each the multi dose vials and for the pre-filled syringes) were provided and show consistent production. All batches have been tested according to the approved specifications. The first three commercial batches of Focetria in both presentations (pre filled syringe and multi dose vial)  have  been  placed  on  stability.  The  company  will  perform  the  stability  studies  to  support  the registered  shelf  life  of  12  months  at  2-8  C.  In  accordance  with  the  relevant  guideline  for  influenza vaccines, the MAH committed to report any unexpected results generated during the stability studies, in case of a confirmed out-of-specification or unexpected trend not supporting the registered shelf-life. Overall, the information presented in Modules 2.3 and 3 was considered in accordance with the abovementioned guidelines and therefore acceptable. 2.3 Non-clinical aspects Introduction Focetria  is  an  inactivated  monovalent  influenza  vaccine,  adjuvanted  with  MF59C.1.  The  vaccine  is based upon virus surface antigens (haemagglutinin and neuraminidase), propagated in eggs.

≥ 7.5 micrograms**

<!-- image -->

Focetria is manufactured with the same process and has the same adjuvant used for Fluad, a trivalent seasonal  influenza  vaccine,  nationally  approved via MRP.  The  MF59C.1  adjuvant  contained  in Focetria  and  Fluad  is  an  oil-  in-  water  emulsion,  composed  mainly  of  squalene.  Taking  this  into consideration the MAH submitted a reduced non-clinical package for Focetria; this is in accordance with  the  guideline  on  dossier  structure  and  content  for  pandemic  influenza  vaccine  marketing authorisation application, CPMP/VEG/4717/03.

For  the  non-clinical  part  of  the  dossier,  the  MAH  has  compiled  data  emerging  from  non-clinical studies with the adjuvant alone and in combination with different antigens, performed over the last 15

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

years. The non-clinical data supporting the approval of Fluad and the MF59 non-clinical data package represent the principal support to this application.

The MAH further provided interim data concerning a non-clinical study in mice aimed at confirming the  immunogenicity of vaccine formulation containing A(H1N1)v antigens made using the Focetria process, with and without MF59 adjuvant, when administered using different regimens.

These interim data seem to confirm that the use of the MF59 adjuvanted vaccine increase the antibody titres and reduces the amount of antigen necessary for the response. The MAH committed to present the  final  report  as  soon  as  the  non  clinical  study  will  be  ended,  as  outlined  in  the  Letter  of Undertaking.

Medicinal product no longer authorised GLP The relevant studies were carried out in compliance with GLP. Pharmacology · Primary pharmacodynamics Information from non-clinical studies with (H5N1) antigen: Ferret challenge study A ferret challenge study was performed to determine the protective efficacy of the pandemic mock up vaccine against challenge with homologous live avian influenza A/NIBRG-14 (H5N1) virus strain and to evaluate its immunogenicity. In order to perform the study, the ferrets were primed with an H3N2 Influenza virus, vaccinated twice with  the  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  (H5N1)  containing  mock-up  vaccine  and  then  challenged  with  the reassortant avian influenza A/NIBRG-14 (H5N1) virus. Two different doses of the mock up vaccine, 7.5  and  15  µg  HA/dose  were  tested;  MF59  adjuvant  served  as  control.  The  use  of  a  heterologous priming infection in ferrets mimics the human condition where individuals are not naïve to influenza virus per se, but are naïve to pandemic virus strains. The following observations were made: ¾ Both the 7.5µg and 15µg vaccine formulations reduced viral shedding in nasal washes and induced seroconversion against Influenza A/NIBRG-14 (H5N1) virus antigen, when compared to the negative control article. ¾ No seroconversion was observed in the negative control animals. ¾ The 15µg vaccine formulation was associated with greater reductions in viral shedding and higher titres of Influenza A/NIBRG-14 (H5N1) virus HA antibodies, compared to the 7.5µg vaccine formulation. ¾ Body temperature elevations were lowest in the animals that were given the 15µg vaccine (as determined from the temperatures measured in the afternoon). ¾ There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  treated  and  control  animals  in symptom scores, weight loss or leukocyte counts.

## Mouse immunogenicity assay

The  MAH has  performed  immunogenicity  studies  in  mice.  The  results  of  a  previous  study,  which confirmed  the  ability  of  MF59  to  enhance  the  antibody  response  (ELISA  and  haemagglutination inhibition [HI]) in young adult (8 weeks-old) and in old BALB/c mice (18 months-old) is summarised below.  The  study  evaluated  the  dose-response  when  various  amounts  of  influenza  trivalent  subunit vaccine were combined with fixed amounts of MF59 (1:1 volume-to-volume ratio), keeping constant the volume of injection. Titration of haemagglutinin (HA) specific immunoglobulin G antibodies was performed from each mouse.

Interim immunogenicity data from a non-clinical study in mice (Focetria Mouse Study No. BB-0910). with  a  vaccine  formulation  containing  antigens  made  using  the  Focetria  process,  with  and  without MF59  adjuvant,  containing  antigen  from  an  A/California/07/2009  H1N1-like  strain  have  been provided and assessed.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Information from non-clinical studies with A(H1N1)v antigen:

The study investigated different vaccine regimens administered to a total of 70 mice. Nine groups of immunologically naïve BALB/c female mice received intramuscular injections of phosphate buffered saline  (PBS;  control  group)  or  antigen  with  or  without  MF59.    Different  vaccination schedules and antigen amounts (0.5 µg with and without MF59 and 1.0 µg without MF59) were investigated.  Mice were 6-7 weeks old at study initiation. The serological immune response was analysed using ELISA

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and  haemagglutination  inhibition  (HI)  assays.  Individual  animal  sera  were  analysed  and  Geometric Mean Titres (GMTs) calculated.

Animals that received 0.5 µg of antigen with MF59 adjuvant had higher titres than those receiving 0.5 or 1.0 µg of antigen alone (Figure 1 and Figure 2).

A single dose of 0.5 µg + MF59 elicited titres of 1:63; a titre of 1:40 is associated with protection in humans from seasonal influenza. A second dose of adjuvanted vaccine increased titres to 1:1280. Two doses of non-adjuvanted antigen were required to elicit titres of 1:160.

The main component of MF59C.1 is squalene. It is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and is a constituent in dietary product (vegetable and fish oil).

Medicinal product no longer authorised Safety pharmacology studies with Focetria were not performed. This approach is in accordance with the  relevant  guidelines,  CPMP/SWP/465/95  and  CPMP/VEG/4717/03.  However,  during  the  early development of MF59 adjuvant, safety pharmacological endpoints were included in two repeat-dose dog toxicology studies conducted to evaluate the safety profile of vaccine formulations with antigens that  are  unrelated  to  this  dossier.  Both  studies  included  a  MF59  group  and  a  saline/buffer  control group. Cardiovascular and neurological parameters were evaluated in the studies. An overview of the study designs and results is provided below. Cardiovascular and neurological evaluations during repeat-dose studies with MF59 in dogs * Evaluated pre-test, and prior to necropsy. Animals were necropsied 1week post-last dose. · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions Such studies are not required according to CPMP/SWP/465/95 and CPMP/VEG/4717/03. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic or classic absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies with Focetria or Fluad or MF59C.1 have not been performed. In accordance with the relevant guidelines (guideline on non-clinical testing vaccine CPMP/SWP/465/95 and guideline on adjuvants in vaccines for human use (EMEA/CHMP/VEG/134716/2004), it is considered acceptable that a complete ADME study has not been conducted because they are considered not relevant for a vaccine.

Clearance study performed in rabbits injected intramuscularly with labelled squalene (125I) demonstrated that it is rapidly cleared and only 5% remains at the injection site for approximately 5 days after injection.

From data available and considering the route of administration, the low volume and the frequency of human administration, the use of squalene does not constitute a risk factor in clinical use.

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity / Repeat dose toxicity

Focetria an inactivated monovalent influenza vaccine, adjuvanted with MF59C.1., manufactured with the same process and has the same adjuvant used for Fluad thus no single dose toxicity/ repeat dose toxicity  studies  are  required  according  CPMP/VEG/4717/03.  Nevertheless  the  MAH  submitted  a repeat-dose toxicity study in rabbits, with seasonal trivalent vaccine + MF59W.1 (Fluad). The human dose of Fluad was administered as two intramuscular injections 14 days apart. There were no systemic adverse effects and the vaccine was tolerated locally, although transient local effects have been shown.

Range-Finding Study (Study No. 1303-002) Table: Study No. 1303-002 - Test and control articles * The clinical dose of MF59 is 0.25 mL In this GLP study, up to 0.5 ml of MF59 was administered IM either 5 (Caesarean section group) or six  (natural  delivery  group)  times.  Two  maternal  deaths  and  a  brief  reduction  in  feed  consumption were  probably  related  to  treatment.  A  slight  increase  (over  historical  incidence)  of  incomplete ossification  of  the  sternebrae,  pubes  and/or  ischia  in  foetuses  was  seen.  However,  the  MF59  dose administered to rats was equivalent to twice the standard clinical dose of 0.25 ml. On a bodyweight basis, each 2× clinical dose in a 0.3 kg rat is approximately 200 times higher than the same dose in a 60 kg human and rats received 5 or 6 doses during the study. MF59 was not considered teratogenic or foetotoxic based on the study results.

Medicinal product no longer authorised * Groups II and V received antigen and are therefore not presented here There were no treatment-related effects on clinical observations, body weight, feed consumption or necropsy observations. No Caesarean-sectioning or litter parameters were affected. The litter averages for corpora lutea, implantations, litter sizes, resorptions, percent male foetuses and percent resorbed conceptuses were comparable among groups. There were no dead foetuses, and no litter consisted of only resorbed conceptuses. One late resorption occurred in a litter in group III (0.25× MF59). There were no gross foetal external alterations. This study was performed to select doses for a definitive study. The definitive study did not have an MF59-alone group, therefore the data is not presented here, however the same dosing schedule with 0.5×  and  1.0×  MF59  combined  with  antigens  had  no  effect  on  litter  parameters  and  was  not teratogenic in rabbits.

Histological examination of the injection site 2 days post-injection revealed interstitial inflammation), interstitial  haemorrhage, and/or muscle fibre degeneration in almost all animals. These observations were  more  notable  in  the  Fluad  group.  However  at  16  and  30  days  after  injections  degenerative changes and inflammatory were still present but to a lower degree and without relevant differences between control and treated groups.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The  design  of  this  study  was  considered  sufficient  to  assess  both  reproductive  and  developmental toxicity. Under the conditions of this study, Fluad H5N1 is well-tolerated, does not cause maternal or embryofoetal toxicity, is not teratogenic, and has no effects on post-natal development. Additionally, the vaccine is immunogenic in maternal rabbits, in foetuses until to the first 4 weeks of life in F1 pups. Considering that the study on 'Reproductive and developmental toxicity of Fluad H5N1 in rabbits, including  a  postnatal  evaluation',  tested  relatively  high  multiples  of  human  doses  for  a  vaccine product (five exposures to levels approximately 30-fold the expected clinical exposure to 7.5 μ g on a body weight basis) it was supposed that Fluad H5N1 is safe also in the human use from this point of view. Overall,  animal  data  did  not  suggest  an  increased  risk  with  respect  to  fertility,  embryo-foetal development and teratogenicity following the administration of MF-59 adjuvant in pregnant animals. From these animal studies, there are no specific reasons for concerns in pregnancy. · Local tolerance Focetria development is based on the manufacturing process of Fluad, a Novartis' trivalent, seasonal influenza  vaccine  (surface  antigen,  inactivated,  adjuvanted  with  MF59C.1)  currently  on  the  market. No local tolerance studies with Focetria are required according CPMP/VEG/4717/03. However, the repeat-dose toxicity study with Fluad in rabbits included an evaluation of local tolerability. There were no clinical signs of any injection site reactions (including Draize score). Macroscopic examination of injection site muscle from animals treated two days previously indicated an  increased  frequency  of  slight  focal  haemorrhage  in  the  Fluad  group,  compared  with  each component  administered  separately.  Complete  recovery  was  observed  in  animals  treated  16  days previously.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Focetria is an inactivated viral vaccine, and only a surface antigen. Squalene is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and is a constituent in dietary product (vegetable and fish oil).

There is no environmental risk for the product itself.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

GCP

The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Introduction Clinical  trials  on  protective  efficacy  for  the  mock-up  vaccine  cannot  be  performed.  Therefore  a detailed  characterisation  of  the  immunological  response  to  the  mock-up  vaccines  is  required.  The vaccine  virus  strains  chosen  for  these  studies  should  allow  simulating  a  situation  where  the  target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve. The criteria for these studies are laid down the guideline on dossier structure and content for pandemic influenza vaccine marketing authorisation application, CPMP/VEG/4717/03. With no other criteria to suggest at present, mock-up vaccine should be able to elicit sufficient immunological response to meet all  three  of  the  current  standards  set  for  existing  vaccines  in  adults  or  older  adults  laid  down  in CPMP/BWP/214/96. In adults aged 18-60 years: · Number  of  seroconversions  or  significant  increase  in  anti-haemagglutinin  antibody  titre  &gt; 40% · Mean geometric increase &gt; 2.5; · Proportion of subjects achieving an HI titre &gt; 40 or SRH (Single Radial Haemolysis) titre &gt; 25 mm 2 &gt; 70%. In adults &gt; 60 years: · Number of seroconversions or significant increase in antihaemagglutinin antibody titre &gt; 30% · Mean geometric increase &gt; 2.0; · Proportion of subjects achieving an HI titre &gt; 40 or SRH titre &gt; 25 mm 2 &gt; 60%. In addition neutralising antibodies should be present. The development program for Focetria is based on this guideline. Early investigations were performed with H5N3 and H9N2 strains. Since  the  avian  influenza  strain  H5N1  strain  considered  as  a  possible  candidate  to  cause  the  next influenza pandemic, the MAH  decided  to base the mock-up  dossier on studies performed (immunogenicity and safety) with A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) strain containing vaccine. Additional clinical data with H5N1 has been submitted and evaluated since the initial approval (see paediatric and supportive studies sections).

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic  studies  were  not  performed  in  accordance  with  the  note  for  guidance  on  clinical evaluation of new vaccines (CPMP/EWP/463/97) and the Guideline on dossier structure and content for pandemic influenza vaccine marketing authorisation application, CPMP/VEG/4717/03.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacodynamics

In  relation  to  vaccines,  pharmacodynamic  studies  are  essentially  comprised  of  the  immunogenicity studies  that  characterise  the  immune  response  to  vaccines.  The  detailed  characterisation  of  the immunological response to the mock-up vaccines is the surrogate parameter for efficacy (CPMP/VEG/4717/03) and these data are discussed below.

## Clinical efficacy

Medicinal product no longer authorised Two dose ranging studies evaluating safety and immunogenicity in young adults have been performed with adjuvanted candidate vaccines. In these trials two different mock-up strains, H5N3 and H9N2, have been used. A total of 161 subjects were enrolled and vaccinated in these studies. Eighty subjects received at least one dose of different formulations of the adjuvanted vaccine and 81 subjects received at least one dose of a comparator non-adjuvanted vaccine. The pivotal study V87P1 was conducted in healthy adults aged 18 to 60 years and subjects &gt; 61 with an adjuvanted candidate vaccine containing the mock-up strain H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004). Dose response studies Study V7P37 Study  V7P37 was  an  observer  blind,  randomised  comparative  dose  ranging  study  to  evaluate safety/reactogenicity and immunogenicity of an adjuvanted influenza vaccine containing the mock-up strain H5N3 as compared to a non-adjuvanted split influenza vaccine containing H5N3. Fifty-five  healthy  adults,  between  18-40  years  old  were  enrolled  in  the  study.  Subjects  were randomised to receive adjuvanted H5N3 vaccine (7.5 μ g, 15 μ g or 30 μ g HA per dose) or the same dose of a non-adjuvanted comparator vaccine according to a 2-dose schedule (day 0, day 21). Immunogenicity was assessed by microneutralisation assay (MN), haemagglutination inhibition assay (HI), and single radial haemolysis (SRH). Blood samples were drawn at day 0, 21, and 42. Antibody cross-reactivity was assessed against heterovariant H5N1 influenza strains. Results : Before immunization all participants had serum HI titres of less than 1:10. After the first and after the second vaccine dose, GMTs of antibody to MF59C.1-adjuvanted vaccine were significantly higher than to non-adjuvanted vaccine. There was no dose response relationship, in particular, within the adjuvanted mock-up strain groups. The highest response was achieved in the two groups with the lowest antigen concentration. At 7·5 μ g the MF59C.1- adjuvanted influenza vaccine gave the highest GMT on day 42. Immunisation with candidate vaccine (adjuvanted influenza vaccine) seroconversion rates between 1860%, were achieved. Interestingly higher seroconversion rates were achieved with the lower antigen content. Seroconversion rate was significantly higher in the adjuvanted groups compared to the nonadjuvanted group, but the dose response was not significant. Seroprotection  rates  were  between  18  and  60%  in  the  adjuvanted  vaccine  groups,  where  higher seroprotection rates were achieved with the lower antigen content. Seroprotection rate was significantly  higher  in  the  adjuvanted  groups  compared  to  the  non-adjuvanted  group,  but  the  dose response was not significant.

Of the 28 subjects, 26 were included in the immunogenicity analyses; 15 of these individuals were previously  vaccinated  with  the  adjuvanted  formulations,  while  the  remaining  11  had  received  the comparator  vaccine.  Immunogenicity  was  assessed  by  MN,  HI  and  SRH.  Serum  samples  were collected before and 3 weeks after revaccination. Results: At  baseline  none  of  the  subjects  had  detectable antibodies as tested by HI and/or MN. By SRH,  subjects  immunised  with  any  dose  of  adjuvanted  candidate  vaccine  still  had  detectable antibodies  against  both  A/H5N3  and  A/H5N1.  Non-adjuvanted  vaccine  recipients  had  detectable antibodies  only  in  the  group  immunised  with  the  15  µg  dose,  and  against  A/H5N3  only.  At  revaccination with adjuvanted candidate vaccine H5N3 GMTs increased significantly when compared to non-adjuvanted vaccine. MF59C.1-adjuvanted H5N3 vaccine induced antibodies that cross-protected against  not  only  the  H5N1  strains  from  1997-1998,  but  also  against  the  more  recent  and  virulent strains isolated in 2003 and 2004 in Vietnam and Hong Kong, which exhibit some antigenic drift as compared to the original strains.

Medicinal product no longer authorised MN SRH Study DIMD 04-019 Study  DMID  04-019  was  double  blind  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of  an adjuvanted influenza vaccine containing the mock-up strain H9N2 as compared to a non-adjuvanted split  influenza  vaccine  containing  the  same  strain.  Young  healthy  adults,  18  to  34  years  old  were included in the study. Four dose levels of adjuvanted candidate vaccine (3.75 µg, 7.5µg, 15 µg and 30 µg  HA/dose)  were  compared  to  the  related  non-adjuvanted  formulations.  A  total  of  48  subjects received 4-dose levels of adjuvanted candidate vaccine (3.75 µg, 7.5µg, 15 µg and 30 µg HA/dose) and 48 subjects received the comparator non-adjuvanted vaccine. Twelve individuals were included in each vaccine group. Two vaccine doses were administered,  four  weeks  apart.  Immunogenicity  was  assessed  by  HI  test, and,  in  a  subset  of  subject  by  using  microneutralisation  (MN)  test;  blood  samples  were  drawn  at baseline, and 28 days after each vaccination (day 28, and 56). Results: Immunogenicity results after two doses with candidate vaccine ± MF59C.1 (mock-up strain H9N2) Parameter GMT (95% CI) % SC (95% CI)

A  better  antibody  response  against  the  vaccine  antigen  (A/Chick/G9  strain)  was  seen  with  the adjuvanted candidate vaccine at all dosages than the respective nonadjuvanted vaccines. GMTs after vaccination  with  adjuvanted  candidate  vaccine  were  consistently  higher  when  compared  to  nonadjuvanted vaccine and reached seroprotective levels for all dosages. The seroconversion rate (4-fold increase) and seroprotection rate (&gt; 40) after 2 doses of adjuvanted candidate vaccine ranged between

91% and 100% depending on the dosage. The non-adjuvanted vaccine was poorly immunogenic even at the highest dose of 30 µg.

- Main study

## Study V87P1

Study  V87P1  is  a  randomised  multicentre  study  designed  to  evaluate  the  reactogenicity  and immunogenicity of two doses of pandemic monovalent (surface antigen adjuvanted with MF59C.1) influenza vaccines (Focetria) administered at different doses (7.5 µg, 15 µg of A/H5N1 antigen) in non-elderly and elderly subjects.

## METHODS

¾

Elderly subject 61 years and over (i.e., ≥ 61)

Medicinal product no longer authorised Study Participants A total of 486 subjects were enrolled, 313 aged 18-60 years (adults) and 173 aged 61 years and over (elderly). Among the adults 157 and 156 subjects received Focetria containing 7.5 µg and 15 µg of A/H5N1  influenza  antigen,  respectively.  Among  the  elderly  87  and  86  subjects  received  Focetria containing 7.5 µg and 15 µg of A/H5N1 influenza antigen (HA), respectively. Treatments Subjects were randomised to receive vaccination Focetria at different doses (7.5 µg and 15 µg HA) adjuvanted  with  MF59.C1.  The  subjects  were  vaccinated  at  day  0  and  day  21.  A  subset  of  the population will receive a booster dose at day 202. Objectives The primary objective was to evaluate the immune response (in term of anti-haemagglutinin antibody) of two doses of pandemic adjuvanted mock-up vaccine (H5N1), 3 weeks after the second dose. The secondary objectives were ¾ To demonstrate non-inferiority of the antibody response elicited, as determined by using HI test,  by  doses  of  Focetria  containing  7.5  µg  of  A/H5N1  HA  vs.  two  doses  of  Focetria containing  15  µg  of  A/H5N1  HA,  in  terms  of  post-immunisation  GMT,  3  weeks  after  the second immunisation. ¾ To  evaluate  immunogenicity  of  one  dose  of  Focetria  containing  either  7.5  µg  or  15  µg  of A/H5N1 HA, as measured by HI, in compliance with CPMP/VEG/4717/03, and by MN (in a subset of subjects). ¾ To evaluate the safety of the administration of two doses of Focetria containing either 7.5 µg or  15  µg  of  A/H5N1  HA  according  to  the  safety  parameters  routinely  used  for  seasonal influenza vaccines (see below). Outcomes/endpoints The co-primary endpoints were defined as follows: Non-elderly adult subjects 18-60 years (i.e., ≥ 18 and &lt; 61) ¾ Number of seroconversions 1  or significant increase in antibody titre 2  &gt; 40% ¾ Mean geometric increase &gt; 2.5 The proportion of subjects achieving an HI titre ≥ 40 should be &gt; 70%·

- ¾ Number of seroconversions 1  or significant increase in antibody titre 2  &gt; 30%
- ¾ Mean geometric increase &gt; 2.0
- ¾ The proportion of subjects achieving an HI titre ≥ 40 should be &gt; 60%

1 Seroconversion is defined as negative pre-vaccination serum (&lt; 10) / post-vaccination titre ≥ 40.

2 Significant increase in antibody titre is defined as at least a fourfold increase from non-negative pre-vaccination serum ( ≥ 10)

Statistical methods / Sample size

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There was no statistical null hypothesis associated with the primary immunogenicity objective, which was analyzed descriptively.

The null hypothesis for the secondary immunogenicity objective stated that a regimen consisting of two  doses  of  Focetria  influenza  vaccine  containing  7.5  µg  each  does  not  comply  with  the  noninferiority  assumption  that  the  lower  limit  of  the  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  of  the  postimmunisation (day 43) GMT ratio is &gt; 0.5, by using HI test, when compared to two doses of Focetria influenza vaccine containing 15 µg.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The target sample size was at least 520 subjects overall (at least 260 aged 18-60 years and260 aged 61 and over). The planned sample size accounted for a 10% dropout rate, in order to achieve a minimum of 460 evaluable subjects (230 in each vaccine group). The sample-size calculation was based on the secondary immunogenicity objective of non-inferiority between two doses of Focetria influenza vaccine containing 7.5 µg vs. two doses of Focetria influenza vaccine containing 15 µg. A  0.025  one-sided  alpha  level,  a  clinically  relevant  value  of  0.5  in  terms  of  the  ratio  of  postimmunisation GMTs (day 43, visit 3) between the two vaccines (i.e., a difference of 0.301 in terms of log10 [GMTs] between vaccines) and a power of 80% were chosen. RESULTS Numbers analysed A total of 486 subjects were enrolled, 313 aged 18-60 years (adults) and 173 aged 61 years and over (elderly).  Among  the  adults  157  and  156  subjects  received  Focetria  influenza  vaccine  containing 7.5 µg and 15 µg of A/H5N1 influenza antigen, respectively. Among the elderly 87 and 86 subjects received  Focetria  influenza  vaccine  containing  7.5  µg  and  15  µg  of  A/H5N1  influenza  antigen, respectively. Out  of  the  486  enrolled  subjects,  464  subjects  were  included  in  the  Per-Protocol  population  (PP) analyses. For the Focetria 7.5µg and the Focetria 15µg groups, 151 and 150 adult subjects and 84 and 79 elderly subjects,  all  respectively,  were  included  in  the  immunogenicity  analyses.  Within  each  age  stratum demographic and other baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. Number of subjects: planned (actually enrolled)

## Outcomes and estimation

Vaccine immunogenicity was assessed on all subjects using the SHR, HI, and MN assays. An analysis of sera by SRH at day 43 has (adults: 297 subjects; elderly: 161 subjects) been performed.

In the baseline seronegative subset (261 adults; 117 elderly) of the total immunogenicity population, there was a tendency for slightly higher GMRs and higher percentages demonstrating seroconversion than in the total immunogenicity population. At day 43 all CHMP immunogenicity criteria were met. The results show that in subjects without detectable antibody titres at baseline the immune response after  two  Focetria  vaccinations  with  7.5  µg  or  15  µg  doses  met  all  three  CHMP  immunogenicity criteria as requested by the EMEA/CPMP/VEG/4717/03.

At  this  time  point  GMTs  respectively  increased  11  and  4.53-fold above baseline. The immune responses to 7.5 µg and 15 µg Focetria were similar.

In the baseline seronegative subset (280 adults; 120 elderly) of the total immunogenicity population, there was a tendency at day 43 for slightly higher GMRs and higher percentages demonstrating at least

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

4-fold  increases  than  in  the  total  immunogenicity  population,  especially  in  the  elderly.  However, slightly  fewer  elderly  subjects  attained  postvaccination  titres  of  at  least  1:20,  1:40,  and  1:80  with similar percentages attaining these titres after the second vaccination in adults regardless of baseline seronegativity.  The  immune  responses  to  7.5  µg  and  15  µg  Focetria  were  similar  in  baseline seronegative subjects.

A clinical trial was conducted with a H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant in 471 children from 6 months to 17 years of age and was submitted in support of the A(H1N1)v pandemic strain variation.  Two  doses  of  vaccine  containing  H5N1  (A/Vietnam/1194/2004)  at  the  dosage  of  7.5  µg haemagglutinin [HA]/dose with MF59C.1 adjuvant were administered three weeks apart.

Medicinal product no longer authorised · Clinical studies in special populations Elderly In study V87P1 seventy-three subjects aged 61 years and over (elderly) were enrolled. For the elderly population, there was no difference between the Focetria 7.5 µg and 15 µg groups in the  attainment  of  the  three  CHMP  criteria  (CPMP/BWP/214/96)  for  the  A/Vietnam/1194/2004-like (H5N1)  influenza  antigen  both  using  the  SRH.  Three  out  of  the  three  CHMP  criteria  were  met  in subjects receiving two doses of either the 7.5 µg or the 15 µg Focetria using the SRH assay. Paediatric population Study V87P6

Study V87P6 was a prospective, randomised, controlled, observer-blind phase II study that performed over a period of approximately 19 months at one study site in Finland.

The objectives for this study were as follows:

Immunogenicity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Primary: To evaluate the magnitude of antibody responses to two doses of Focetria influenza vaccine, each containing 7.5µg of H5N1 antigen administered 3 weeks apart in subjects of different ages.

Secondary: To evaluate the magnitude of antibody response to a 12 months booster dose of Focetria influenza vaccine, containing 7.5µg of H5N1 antigen in subjects of different ages.

To evaluate the persistence of specific antibodies 12 months after primary immunisation in subjects of different ages.

To evaluate the cross-protection of a Focetria influenza vaccine, containing 7.5µg of H5N1 antigen in subjects of different ages.

## Safety

Medicinal product no longer authorised Primary:  To  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  two  0.5mL  intramuscular  (IM)  injections  of Focetria influenza vaccine containing 7.5µg of A/H5N1 influenza antigen, administered 3 weeks apart. Secondary: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of one 0.5mL IM injection of Focetria influenza vaccine containing 7.5µg of A/H5N1 influenza antigen, administered 12 months after the second dose. To evaluate the safety profile of Focetria influenza vaccine when compared to FLUAD. Study design: This  is  a  prospective,  randomised,  controlled,  observer-blind  phase  II  study  that  performed  over  a period  of  approximately  19  months  at  one  study  site  in  Finland.  Approximately  469  subjects  aged 6 months to 17 years were planned to be enrolled and followed, in three age-groups as follows: · Cohort 1: toddlers aged 6 to &lt;36 months (stratified 6 to &lt;12, 12 to &lt;24, 24 to &lt;36 months). · Cohort 2: children aged 3 to &lt;9 years (stratified in 3 to &lt; 6 and 6 to &lt;9 years). · Cohort 3: adolescents aged 9 to &lt;18 years (stratified in 9 to &lt;14 and 14 to &lt;18 years). Subjects in cohort 1 were stratified in three age groups; subjects in cohort 2 and 3 were stratified in two age groups each. Each  age  group  has  been  randomised  in  a  3:1  ratio  to  receive  either  two  0.5ml  doses  of  Focetria influenza vaccine (applicable for all age groups) or two 0.25ml (subjects &lt;3 years of age) or 0.5ml (subjects &gt; 3 years of age) doses of FLUAD influenza vaccine. All subjects have been vaccinated either with the prepandemic influenza vaccine Focetria, which is an egg-derived,  surface-antigen,  inactivated,  influenza  vaccine,  adjuvanted  with  MF59C.1  (MF59), identical to the authorised interpandemic FLUAD with the exception of antigen composition and dose, or with the seasonal influenza vaccine FLUAD, a licensed, egg-derived, surface-antigen, inactivated, influenza vaccine, adjuvanted with MF59C.1 (MF59), containing the antigens proposed for the current season 2007/2008. So far FLUAD is not licensed for children below 18 years of age. Vaccines  have  been  administered  3  weeks  apart  intramuscularly  (IM)  into  the  deltoid  muscle (preferably of the non-dominant arm) or anterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass). Subjects in the Focetria group will receive one booster vaccination 12 months after the second dose. Sample size A total of 472 subjects have been enrolled in three cohorts: · Cohort 1: 201 toddlers aged 6 to &lt;36 months, · Cohort 2: 136 children aged 3 to &lt;9 years,

- Cohort 3: 134 adolescents aged 9 to &lt;18 years

Subjects have been randomised in a 3:1 ratio to Focetria and to Fluad.

The study report presented immunogenicity and safety results up to visit 8 (day 403), 3 weeks after the booster injection.

For all age cohorts (6 to &lt;36 months, 3 to &lt;9years and 9 to &lt;18 years), randomisation assignments were supplied to designated unblinded study personnel in sealed envelopes.

Randomisation lists were prepared by Novartis Vaccines Biostatistics and Clinical Data Management (BCDM) department.

## Serology

Medicinal product no longer authorised *Subjects received 0.25mL doses of Fluad,**Subjects received 0.5mL doses of Fluad, and all subjects of the Focetria group will receive 0.5mL doses. The demographic and other baseline characteristics were balanced between the two vaccine groups and within each of the three age cohorts (6 to &lt;36months, 3 to &lt;9years, and 9 to &lt;18 years). Overall, the premature withdrawal rate was comparatively higher in MF59-PanH5N1 IV group across all age cohorts, mostly due to withdrawal of consent from day 43 to day 202. Percentages of Subjects Prematurely Terminating the Study - All Randomized Set a &lt;1% = 1 subject Higher percentages of toddlers, children and adolescents in the Focetria group than the Fluad group had  major  protocol  deviations,  mostly  due  to  the  failure  of  subjects  to  provide  a  blood  draw immediately before the booster vaccination and 21 days afterwards. In toddlers most of the reasons for protocol deviations in both vaccine groups were related to blood draws and/or vaccinations either not given within the protocol-specified time window or at all.

Blood was collected from all subjects on days 1, 22, 43 and for the Focetria group blood was also collected on days 382 and 403 for the evaluation of immunogenicity. The measures of immunogenicity, collected for all evaluable subjects of the Focetria group include:

- Geometric mean titres/area (GMTs/GMAs) and geometric mean ratios (GMRs) on days 1, 22, and 43, 382 and day 403 as determined by HI, SRH, and MN.
- Percentage  of  subjects  achieving  seroconversion  or  significant  increase  in  antibody  titer  on days 22, 43, 382, and 403 as measured by HI and SRH.
- Percentage of subjects with MN titres ≥ 1:20, ≥ 1:40, ≥ 1:80 on day 1, day 22, and day 43.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Percentage of subjects achieving at least a four-fold rise in antibody titer on days 22, 43, 382, and 403 as measured by MN.
- Percentage of subjects achieving a titer ≥ 40/  area ≥ 25mm 2 on  days  22,  43,  382  and  403  as determined by HI and SRH.

Serum  samples  have  been  assessed  by  means  of  strain-specific  HI,  MN  and  SRH  tests  against A/H5N1.

HI and MN assays have been performed at Novartis Vaccines, Clinical Serology Laboratory, Marburg, Germany.

SRH  test  has  been  performed  at  Dipartimento  di  Fisiopatologia,  Medicina  Sperimentale  e  Sanità Pubblica, Laboratorio di Epidemiologia Molecolare, Università di Siena, Siena, Italy.

As assessed by HI and SRH serology assays, naïve populations needed two vaccinations of MF59adjuvanted  H5N1  vaccine  to  meet  the  CHMP  criteria  while  the  same  population  only  needed  one booster vaccination to meet all three CHMP criteria.

All sera were tested in duplicate, if an individual result is below detection limit it will be set to 5 in the laboratory.  The geometric mean value of the duplicate test values was received from the lab and used for analysis. Regarding  the  SRH  assay  the  diameter  of  the  haemolytic  zones  observed  including  the  well  were provided by the laboratory. Zone areas (including the inner well) were calculated via the circle area function. The inner well has a diameter of 2.256 mm thus the area of the inner well is 4mm². Repeated measurements on the same sample are aggregated via the geometric mean of the respective areas. All areas below the lower limit of detection will be set to 4 for the immunogenicity analysis. Individual MN titres below detection limit were set to half that limit (i.e. to a value of 10) for further analysis. In  the  interpretation  of  HI  and  SRH  immunogenicity  results,  CHMP  criteria  (CPMP/BWP/214/96) have been used as the reference Immunogenicity results: After  the  first  vaccination  containing  7.5µg  of  H5N1  antigen,  toddlers  (6  to  &lt;36  months  of  age), children (3 to &lt;9 years of age), and adolescents (9 to &lt;18 years of age) met either one or two of the CHMP  criteria  (GMR,  seroconversion  or  significant  increase,  and  seroprotection)  for  non-elderly adults (i.e., 18 to 60 years old) when assessed by HI and SRH assay. After  the  second  vaccination,  administered  3  weeks  after  the  first,  each  age  cohort  met  all  three  of these CHMP criteria whether assessed by HI or SRH assay. Although GMTs/GMAs decreased (significantly, based on the 95% CIs) from 21 days after primary vaccinations  (day  43)  to  the  booster  vaccination  (day  382),  antibodies  remained  detectable,  when assessed by HI and SRH assays. Between 26% and 46% of each age cohort were seroprotected at day 382 when assessed by HI and HI assay between 61% and 88% of each age cohort were seroprotected when assessed by SRH. After the booster vaccination, all age cohorts met all three of the CHMP criteria when assessed by HI and SRH assays. The GMTs/GMAs by HI and SRH were highest after the booster vaccination across all age cohorts.

## Results by age-group with the HI assay:

In  toddlers  aged  6  to&lt;36  months  HI  assay  on  sera  collected  21  days  after  the  second  vaccination, showed a 129-fold increase in GMT over day 1.  Although GMTs decreased significantly from 21 days after primary vaccinations (day 43)  to the booster vaccination (day 382), antibodies were still detectable (GMT 24) and 21 days after booster vaccination a 55-fold increase in titres was observed that exceeded the CHMP requirement.   At 21 days after booster vaccination (day 403), 98% toddlers achieved the seroconversion or significant increase. After booster vaccination 99% of toddlers were seroprotected

Medicinal product no longer authorised In children 3 to &lt;9 years of age twelve months after the primary vaccinations 26% of children were seroprotected, indicating some persistence of antibodies. Regardless of pre-booster titer, 21 days after booster  vaccination,  a  large  increase  in  titres  (73-fold)  was  observed  and  95%  of  subjects  achieved seroconversion or significant increase. After the booster vaccination 98%  of children were seroprotected In  adolescents  9  to  &lt;18  years  of  age  GMTs  decreased  significantly  from  21  days  after  primary vaccinations (day 43) to the booster vaccination (day 382), but antibodies were still detectable (GMT = 12). Twelve months after the two primary vaccinations, 30% of the adolescents were seroprotected, indicating some persistence of antibody titres. After booster vaccination a large increase in titres (39fold) was observed. At 21 days after booster vaccination (day 403), adolescents again exceeded the CHMP  criterion  with  91%  of  subjects  achieving  seroconversion  or  significant  increase.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

The  development  of  Focetria  is  based  on  the  experience  of  Fluad,  Novartis'  seasonal  trivalent adjuvanted  influenza  vaccine.  The  MF59C.1  adjuvant  contained  in  the  vaccine  is  an  oil-  in-  water emulsion, composed mainly of squalene. Focetria is manufactured with the same process and has the same adjuvant used for Fluad.

Initial dose finding studies with an adjuvanted candidate vaccine containing mock-up strains H5N3 or H9N2 showed that a dose as low as 3.75 µg HA elicits adequate seroprotection in healthy adults. All three immunogenicity criteria defined by CHMP (CPMP/BWP/214/96) were fulfilled. However these results are based on a very small number of individuals (10-12 individuals per vaccine group).

Medicinal product no longer authorised The studies also confirmed that adjuvant MF59C.1 significantly enhances specific immune response to influenza vaccines. In fact, this result is consistent across studies and tests used (HI, MN, SRH). It is also evident that two doses of candidate vaccine were necessary to induce a proper immune response against H5N1. Subsequently, the dossier was shifted to a H5N1 mock-up file and further data were provided for this vaccine in order to establish efficacy Focetria. For 7.5 µg and 15 µg HA group, seroconversion rate and seroconversion factor in the adult and the elderly population were in compliance with CHMP requirements (CPMP/BWP/214/96). In both age groups,  the  GMTs  induced  by  Focetria  (7.5  µg  HA)  was  non-inferior  to  the  GMTs  induced  by  the vaccine containing 15 µg HA. Seroprotection  rates  in  adults  and  elderly  calculated  using  the  SRH  assay  met  the  set  CHMP requirements. These results were sustained also by the microneutralisation assay. In view of results from paediatric data generated with Focetria (H5N1), the CHMP pointed out that although  there  are  no  established  criteria  for  the  interpretation  of  immune  responses  to  influenza vaccines in children the measured responses following two doses were high and consistent across the age groups and the different assays. Post-vaccination titres are higher than those observed in adults. It  has  to  be  noted  that  immune  responses  in  healthy  children  aged  6  months-17  years,  after administration of two doses, comfortably exceeded the CHMP criteria applied to seasonal vaccines. Clinical safety · Patient exposure Study V87P1 Overall 485 subjects of the 486 enrolled were exposed to the investigational vaccines and included in the  safety  analyses.  Among the adults, one subject did not receive any dose and 7 subjects did not receive the second dose. Among the elderly, 7 subjects did not receive the second dose.

The percentages of adults experiencing each local reaction, systemic reaction and other indicators of reactogenicity (i.e., staying home due to a reaction and using analgesics or antipyretics medication) were generally similar between the Focetria 7.5 µg and 15 µg groups and overall.

The most frequently experienced local reaction was pain.

The most frequently experienced systemic reactions were myalgia and headache, followed by chills, malaise, arthralgia and fatigue.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Twenty-one adults, 7 % of the overall adult population, experienced symptoms consistent with oculorespiratory-symptoms (ORS). All reactions were mild except for one adult who reported moderate red eye  on  day  2.  This  is  in  the  same  range  as  other  reports  on  ORS  in  clinical  studies  with  influenza vaccines.

Local and systemic reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Each severe local reaction and each severe systemic reaction was experienced by no more than 2% of adults overall.

The  percentages  of  elderly  subjects  experiencing  each  local  reaction,  systemic  reaction  and  other indicators of reactogenicity were generally similar between the Focetria 7.5 µg and 15 µg groups and overall.

The most frequently experienced local reaction was pain.

The  most  frequently  experienced  systemic  reactions  in  the  elderly  were  myalgia,  headache  and arthralgia followed by chills, malaise, and fatigue.

Overall, 6 elderly subjects, 3.5% of the overall elderly population, experienced symptoms consistent with ORS. All reactions were mild except for one elderly who reported severe coughing at 6 hours and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

on day 2 after the first dose. This is in the same range as other reports on ORS in clinical studies with influenza vaccines.

Local and systemic reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity

## Study V87P6

In total, 471 out of the 472 enrolled paediatric subjects were vaccinated and were therefore included in the safety population and data up to day 403 is presented in the study report

Medicinal product no longer authorised Toddlers 6 to &lt;36 months of age: A total of 201 toddler subjects were enrolled and randomised in this age cohort, all were vaccinated according  to  the  randomisation  list  (145  received  Focetria  and  56  received  Fluad).  All  subjects provided some post vaccination safety data and were therefore included in at least one safety analysis. Overall  reactogenicity  was  highest  after  the  first  vaccination  and  decreased  after  the  second vaccination. A total of 76% [110/145] of Focetria and 75% [42/56] of Fluad recipients after first injection and 68% [94/139] of Focetria and 63% [35/56] of Fluad recipients, after second vaccination reported at least one solicited local or systemic reaction, which by definition onset within 7 days of vaccination. The CHMP noted that there is a high proportion of subjects who reported adverse events of any type. Such reactogenicity does not seem to be related to the full dose of MF59 because similar proportion is observed in Fluad, in recipient of half dosage of Fluad. The proportion of subjects reporting events is dependent upon the active surveillance post immunisation.  The CHMP considered that a comparison across  different  products  and  age  groups  performed  using  a  subset  of  events  including  objective measurements such as body temperature did not raise any concern. Most  solicited  reactions  were  mild  or  moderate,  with  no  more  than  2%  of  each  solicited  local  or systemic reaction classified as severe in either vaccine group. They mostly were transient with few continuing past the day 7 observation window and none continued at the end of the study. Erythema  (21  %  [12/56]  to  33%  [46/139]  after  any  injection  and  tenderness  (21%[12/56]  to 29%[16/56]  after  any  injection)  were  the  most  common  solicited  local  reactions  and  irritability (20%[11/56] to 39%[56/145] after any injection) was the most common solicited systemic reaction in both  vaccine  groups.  The  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  any  solicited  local  or  systemic  reactions were similar between the two vaccine groups. None of the subjects in any vaccination groups reported body temperature ≥ 40°C.

The percentages of subjects with any AEs, regardless of their assessment of relatedness, were balanced between the two vaccine groups (55% [80/145] and 51% [71/138] Focetria and 61% [34/56] and 52% [29/56] Fluad, after first and second injection, respectively, for all AE's) and (18% [26/145] and 13% [18/138] Focetria and 14% [8/56] and 18% [10/56] Fluad, after first and second injection, respectively, for at least possibly related AEs)]. No death or AE leading to a subject's withdrawal from the study was reported. Within this age cohort, there was one subject who reported one SAE (hospitalisation due to acute pyelonephritis) but it was assessed as not related to the study vaccines.

## Children 3 to &lt;9 years of age:

A total of 136 children were enrolled and randomised in this age cohort, all were vaccinated according to  the  randomisation  list  (96  received  Focetria  and  40  received  Fluad).  All  subjects  provided  some post-vaccination safety data and were therefore included in at least one safety analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total of 72% [69/96] of Focetria and 80% [32/40] of Fluad recipients, after first injection and 68% [63/93] of Focetria and 56% [22/39] of Fluad recipients, after second injection, reported at least one solicited local or systemic reaction. Most solicited reactions were mild or moderate, with no more than 5% of each solicited local or systemic reaction classified as severe in either vaccine group, most of them were transient.

Pain (36% [14/39] to 53% [49/93] after any injection) was the most common solicited local reaction, no more than 5% children complained of severe pain after any injection, and headache (9% [8/93] to 23% [9/40] after any injection) was the most common systemic reaction in both vaccine groups. The proportion of subjects reporting any solicited local or systemic reactions were similar between the two vaccine groups. None of the subjects in any vaccine groups reported body temperature ≥ 40°C.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The percentages of subjects with any AEs, regardless of their assessment of relatedness, were similar between the groups [(39% [37/96] and 32% [30/93] Focetria and 30% [12/40] and 36% [14/39] Fluad, after first and second injection, respectively for all AEs) and (15% [14/96] and 16% [15/93] Focetria and 13% [5/39] Fluad, after first and second injection, respectively for at least possibly related AEs)]. No death or AE leading to a subject's withdrawal from the study was reported during the study. One subject reported one SAE, (hospitalisation due to moderate renal injury) was assessed as not related to the study vaccines. Adolescents 9 to &lt;18 years of age: A  total  of  134  adolescents  were  enrolled  and  randomised  in  this  age  cohort,  all  were  vaccinated according to the randomisation list (93 received Focetria and 41 received Fluad). All subjects provided some post-vaccination safety data and were therefore included in at least one safety analysis. A total of 91% [85/93] of Focetria and 88% [36/41] of Fluad recipients after first injection and 82% [75/91] of Focetria and 78% [31/40] of Fluad recipients, after second injection, reported at least one solicited local or systemic reaction. Most  solicited  reactions  were  mild  or  moderate,  with  no  more  than  5%  of  each  solicited  local  or systemic reaction classified as severe in either vaccine group, most of them were transient. Pain (63% [25/40] to 78% [73/93] after any injection) was the most common local reaction, no more than 5% of adolescents complained of severe pain, and headache (22% [20/91] to 59% [24/41] after any injection) the most common solicited systemic reaction in both vaccine groups. The proportion of subjects  reporting  any  solicited  local  or  systemic  reactions  were  similar  between  the  two  vaccine groups. None of the subjects in any vaccine groups reported body temperature ≥ 40°C.

It can be summarised that two injections of adjuvanted (H5N1) vaccine induced a high proportion of subjects reporting the occurrence of any event following immunisation. Solicited local and systemic reactions  after  vaccination  were  mostly  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  There  was  no  clear  and consistent difference in the reactogenicity profile between the two formulations, but a slight increase in the reactogenicity profile with increasing age was noted. The study design was not aimed to identify differences  due  to  the  adjuvant  presence  as  both  study  groups  received  it.  Such  issue  has  been addressed in the study V70P2 whose synopsis has been presented as supporting documentation.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Percentages of subjects with solicited and unsolicited reactions are provided below:

Despite the greater local and general reactogenicity with the adult dose, uptake of the second dose was not  affected  by  withdrawals  due  to  AE  onset.  In  addition  the  data  do  not  indicate  that  higher reactogenicity was associated with SAEs.

## Concomitant administration

## Study V101 P1

The MAH presented within the rolling review (RR/04) a Phase II, randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, multi centre study on the safety and immunogenicity of an investigational tetravalent influenza vaccine 10 manufactured by Novartis in adults aged 18 years and above.

<!-- image -->

Medicinal product no longer authorised A total of 600 study subjects were included in a staggered two-step enrolment. In  this  study  one  group  of  adults  of  199  subjects  received  one  dose  of  Focetria  H5N1  and concomitantly,  but  in  a  different  arm,  one  dose  of  a  licensed  unadjuvanted  seasonal  vaccine.  This group  was  compared  with  two  groups  receiving  either  an  investigational  tetravalent  vaccine  or Focetria H5N1 alone. Immunogenicity Objectives The  primary  objective  was  to  show  that  SRH  antibody  titres  against  A/H5N1  elicited  by  the  three different immunisation schedules were equivalent at day 43. Safety Objectives To evaluate the safety of the administration of one 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) dose of Focetria given before  or  after  one  0.5  mL  intramuscular  (IM)  dose  of  a  tetravalent  vaccine  or  after  a  concomitant administration in different sites of Focetria and a licensed seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine. Results Across all three vaccine groups the H5N1 strain met all three CHMP criteria as assessed by the SRH assay;  for  the  interpandemic  strains  (H1N1,  H3N2,  and  B),  all  three  vaccine  groups  met  all  three CHMP criteria. Solicited  local  and  systemic  reactions  were  generally  reported  most  frequently  after  the  tetravalent vaccine, irrespective of vaccine group.  Reactogenicity was generally lower with Focetria H5N1, and even lower with the seasonal vaccine. Data on co-administration of subunit not adjuvanted influenza seasonal and pandemic H5N1 vaccines in adults did not suggest any interference in the immune response to seasonal or to H5N1 antigens or differences  in  the  safety  profile  between  concomitant  and  non-concomitant  administration  of  the vaccines. The CHMP noted that data on the concomitant use with seasonal flu vaccines in paediatric population are however still lacking. Data on co-administration of the vaccine (Focetria H5N1) with vaccines other than influenza have so far not been generated.

## Supportive studies

The  dose  finding  studies  V7P37  (and  extension  study  V7P37E1)  and  DMID  04-019  include  161 subjects of which 80 subjects received at least one dose of different formulations of the adjuvanted candidate vaccine and 81 subjects received at least one dose of a comparator non-adjuvanted vaccine. The  total  number  of  176  doses  of  adjuvanted  candidate  vaccine  and  172  doses  of  non-adjuvanted control vaccine were administered.

In study V7P37 and extension study V7P37E1, pain was the most frequently reported local reaction in the adjuvanted group. At each dose level the frequency is higher compared to the control group, in addition there appeared to be a dose response relationship.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The most frequently reported systemic reaction is headache, followed by myalgia and fatigue. No dose response relationship or marked difference with the control group can be observed. In study DMID 04-019 tenderness was most frequently reported, and pain and tenderness were both more  frequently  reported  as  in  the  non-adjuvanted  group  after  each  dose.  After  the  second  dose, erythema and induration are also more frequently reported in the adjuvanted group. Headache  was  the  most  common  systemic  reaction.  There  was  no  obvious  difference  between  the groups or dose levels. A limited number of subjects reported one or more unsolicited events, 4 subjects in study V7P37, 2 in the  adjuvanted  candidate  vaccine  (H5N3)  15 μ g  group,  one  in  the  adjuvanted  candidate  vaccine (H5N3)  7.5 μ g  group  and  one  after  the  second  dose  of  the  non-adjuvanted  7.5 μ g  dose  group.  In extension study V7P37E1 a total of two subjects, both in the adjuvanted candidate vaccine (H5N3) 30 μ g group, reported 3 non-serious adverse events (fever and headache, injection site pain), which were considered to be probably related to the vaccine. In study DMID 04-019 in total 160 AEs were reported, 105 of which onset after the first vaccination and 55 after the second vaccination. The most frequently reported systemic reaction after vaccination with the adjuvanted candidate vaccine was headache (up to 50% of subjects in group containing 30 µg non-adjuvanted vaccine. Reports  of  severe  common  reactions  were  limited  to  one  subject  receiving  15  µg  non-adjuvanted vaccine who experienced severe malaise and nausea. Ancillary analysis on pregnant women To date, MF59 has been evaluated as an adjuvant for vaccines by Novartis and others against a range of infectious agents, including pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses (e.g., H3N2, H5N1), herpes simplex-2 virus (HSV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus (CMV). An MF59-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine (FLUAD) has been licensed for active prophylaxis of seasonal influenza in elderly adults in 12 EU countries with MRP, and several other non-EU countries throughout the world, but not in the USA. To date, there have  been  no  clinical  trials  designed  to  evaluate  the  tolerability  and  safety  of  MF59-adjuvanted vaccines in pregnant women. The  MAH  analysed  the  number  of  pregnancies  and  relative  outcomes  occurred  in  females  of childbearing  potential  included  in  the  safety  database  of  clinical  trials  with  MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccines.

Overall, 150 pregnancies were reported during clinical trials with MF59-adjuvanted vaccines. No occurrence of congenital abnormalities was reported.

Data presented are very limited and not allow drawing any conclusion on the safety profile of Focetria  administered  in  pregnant  women.  These  data  support  the  request  for  a  prospective pregnancy registry suggested in the RMP.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

The  safety  analysis  was  based  mainly  on  the  pivotal  study  with  H5N1  candidate  vaccine.  The observed  rate  of  adverse  events  was  lower  than  expected.  Reactogenicity  was  generally  higher  for adults  compared  to  elderly,  and  after  the  first  than  the  second  dose.  No  major  differences  were observed between the Focetria 7.5 µg and 15 µg groups.

Additional information submitted post core-dossier authorisation from a study in 471 children did not raise any new issues for the safety profile of MF-59-adjuvanted vaccine containing the H5N1 strain.

The MF59C.1 adjuvant is also included in the currently licensed Fluad seasonal influenza vaccine. Additional  available  information  on  adjuvant  safety  from  clinical  studies  and  Post-Marketing surveillance has been provided and support the favourable safety profile of Focetria.

The attack rate for the A(H1N1)v virus strain is expected to be higher than for recently circulating seasonal  strains  because  of  the  lower  levels  of  pre-existing  immunity  in  the  population.  Current estimates  for  the  attack  rate  associated  with  the  influenza  A(H1N1)v  virus  over  the  first  wave  of infection  vary  from  approximately  10-30  %  in  different  geographical  areas.  As  a  result,  the  actual numbers of clinically apparent infections, cases that require hospitalisation and deaths in the pandemic period  is  expected  to  be  higher  than  in  recent  years  for  seasonal  influenza.  These  estimates  may change (upwards or downwards) during the course of the pandemic.

On 11 June 2009 the WHO declared Phase 6 of the influenza pandemic. The declaration reflected sustained transmission of the virus from person to person in several WHO regions. WHO and other international  agencies  are  now  calling  the  disease pandemic  (H1N1)v  2009 .  For  the  virus  the nomenclature influenza A(H1N1)v virus (where v indicates variant) has been chosen.

Focetria is a core dossier pandemic influenza vaccine, whose scientific development is based on the guideline  on  dossier  structure  and  content  for  pandemic  influenza  vaccine  marketing  authorisation application  (CPMP/VEG/4717/03)  and  the  guideline  on  submission  of  marketing  authorisation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

applications for pandemic influenza vaccines through the centralised procedure (CPMP/VEG/4986/03).

Focetria  has  been  authorised  under  the  core  mock-up  procedure  which  foresees  the  insertion  of  a pandemic strain A(H1N1)v into the authorised mock-up vaccine. This procedure was performed as a strain variation.

This principle is based on the extrapolation of clinical safety and immunogenicity data obtained with the mock-up vaccine in the Focetria case using the A(H5N1) strain to the same vaccine construct using the current influenza A(H1N1)v pandemic strain.

Medicinal product no longer authorised It is expected that the insertion of the influenza A(H1N1)v  strain into the mock-up vaccine construct does not have a substantial effect on safety and immunogenicity compared to the corresponding mockup  vaccine  when  used  in  a  comparable  population  (i.e.  in  terms  of  naivety,  health  status  and  age group).  The presence of a comparable effect on immunogenicity will however be verified with the results from the upcoming clinical studies in view of a population that is possibly less naïve towards A(H1N1)v compared to H5N1. The Focetria SPC summarises the existing clinical data collected with the H5N1 strain and will be updated on an ongoing basis as considered necessary by the CHMP. Quality The manufacture of the virus surface inactivated antigen, the formulated drug product bulk and final medicinal  product  are  well  defined,  appropriately  controlled  and  sufficiently  validated.    The  same manufacturing process was employed for the A(H1N1)v like-strain vaccine as previously established and approved for the mock-up A(H5N1) vaccine. Adequate in-process controls, release and shelf life specifications have been set in line with relevant requirements (e.g. Ph.Eur.). The relevant quality data generated  in  the  mock-up  vaccine  can  be  considered  supportive  for  this  pandemic  strain  change. Additional quality data required specifically for the strain change have been provided and satisfactorily demonstrate the quality of the vaccine. Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology The non-clinical package for Focetria, this is in accordance with the relevant guidelines, namely the guideline  on  dossier  structure  and  content  for  pandemic  influenza  vaccine  marketing  authorisation application (CPMP/VEG/4717/03), the note for guidance on preclinical pharmacological testing and toxicological  testing  of  vaccines  guidelines  pertaining  to  the  non-clinical  testing  requirements  for vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95) and the guideline on adjuvants in vaccines for human use (CPMPVEG/17/03/2004). The challenge testing in the ferret shows that the formulation of vaccine containing either 7.5 µg or 15 µg of  A/NIBRG-14 (H5N1) antigen per dose is both immunogenic and efficacious in reducing the viral  load  and  viral  shedding.  The  various  disease  markers  indicate  the  protective  effects  of vaccination with the formulation of the vaccine used.

Immunogenicity  studies  in  young  and  old  mice  showed  that  immunisation  with  both  adjuvanted candidate  vaccine  and  non-adjuvanted  vaccine,  elicited  a  dose-related  antigen-specific  antibody response, even in mice seropositive at baseline. The presence of MF59 adjuvant resulted in a more immunogenic and therefore more efficacious product, in both young and old mice.

Non-clinical safety data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, embryo-foetal and postnatal toxicity (up to the end of the lactation period).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Non-clinical data with Focetria submitted in connection with this variation did not raise concerns in view of reproduction toxicity and gave first information on the effect on immunogenicity of vaccine manufactured with the A(H1N1)v strain.

## Clinical

Most of the clinical data at time of the strain variation were generated with vaccine constructs that included an influenza A(H5N1) strain.

Medicinal product no longer authorised It is expected that the insertion of the influenza A(H1N1)v  strain into the mock-up vaccine construct does not have a substantial effect on immunogenicity and safety compared to the corresponding mockup  vaccine  when  used  in  a  comparable  population  (i.e.  in  terms  of  naivety,  health  status  and  age group). Considerations for extrapolation of the clinical data include that the immunogenicity data available for the approved mock-up vaccines were generated using a strain to which the majority of subjects were immunologically naïve based on pre-vaccination testing for neutralising antibody and for antibody that inhibits haemagglutination. It is assumed that the safety of the H5N1 mock-up vaccine is predictive for the influenza A(H1N1)v strain in the population it has been tested. However rare adverse reactions that might be specific to the influenza A(H1N1)v strain can only be evaluated during very widespread usage. First  clinical  data  with  a  vaccine  produced  in  MDCK cell lines containing the influenza A(H1N1)v strain has become available and preliminary results indicate a good immune response after one dose of this different construct, nevertheless containing the same adjuvant (MF59). Currently there is only limited data with Focetria in children and very limited data in pregnant women, immunocompromised patients  and  other  risk  groups  or  specific  populations  available.  Therefore  in populations other than those in which it has been tested, data obtained with a mock-up vaccine would have to be extrapolated from the safety and immunogenicity of a corresponding construct or other age groups containing the A(H1N1)v pandemic strain. Data  from  ongoing  and  planned  clinical  trials  as  specified  in  the  agreed  pharmacovigilance/risk management plan using the Focetria vaccine construct with the current pandemic influenza A(H1N1)v strain are reviewed on an ongoing basis. These studies will allow obtaining safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data for the influenza A(H1N1)v  vaccine. Efficacy Clinical trials on protective efficacy for the mock-up vaccine were not possible as the strain causing the current pandemic as well as the subjects with a corresponding infection were not present at that time. Therefore a detailed characterisation of the immunological response has been performed.

The  development  of  Focetria  is  based  on  the  experience  with  Fluad,  Novartis'  seasonal,  trivalent adjuvanted influenza vaccine. The MF59C.1 adjuvant is an oil- in- water emulsion, composed mainly of squalene. Focetria is manufactured with the same process and has the same adjuvant used for Fluad.

Initial dose finding studies with an adjuvanted candidate vaccine containing mock-up strains H5N3 or H9N2 showed that a dose as low as 3.75 µg HA elicits adequate seroprotection in healthy adults. All three immunogenicity criteria defined by CHMP (CPMP/BWP/214/96) were fulfilled. However these results are based on a very small number of individuals (10-12 individuals per vaccine group).

The  studies  confirm  that  adjuvant  MF59C.1  significantly  enhances  specific  immune  response  to influenza vaccines. In fact, this result is consistent across studies and tests used (HI, MN, SRH). It is also evident that two doses of candidate vaccine are necessary to induce a proper immune response.

Subsequently, the dossier was shifted to a H5N1 mock-up file and further data were provided for this vaccine in order to establish efficacy Focetria.

Immunogenicity of the mock-up strain A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) was determined in 458 subjects (297 adults; 161 elderly) by using by single radial haemolysis (SRH) and haemagglutination inhibition assay. In addition to SRH, an analysis of serum samples assayed by microneutralisation assay (MN) has been repeated on the full immunogenicity population (301 adults; 163 elderly). Subjects received 2 doses of Focetria containing 7.5 µg or 15 µg influenza antigen (HA).

For 7.5 µg and 15 µg HA group, seroconversion rate and seroconversion factor in the adult and the elderly population were in compliance with CHMP requirements (CPMP/BWP/214/96). In both age groups, the GMTs induced by Focetria (7.5 µg HA) were non-inferior to the GMTs induced by the vaccine  containing  15  µg  HA.  Seroprotection  rates  in  adults  and  elderly  calculated  using  the  SRH assay met the set CHMP requirements. These results were sustained also by the microneutralisation assay.

All SAEs were considered as not related to vaccination by the investigator. There was one unrelated death across all studies.

Medicinal product no longer authorised A  clinical  trial  submitted  post  core-dossier  authorisation  was  conducted  with  a  H5N1  vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant in 471 children from 6 months to 17 years of age. Two doses of vaccine containing H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) at the dosage of 7.5 µg haemagglutinin [HA]/dose with  MF59C.1  adjuvant  were  administered  three  weeks  apart.  21  days  after  the  second  dose  the seroprotection and seroconversion rate and for anti-HA antibody antibodies to H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004  in  the  toddlers  aged  from  6  to  35  months,  3  to  8  years  and  9  to  17  years measured  by  SRH  were  all  between  98  and  100%.  Seroconversion  factors  varied  from  14  and  16 between the 3 age groups. These results indicate a substantiated immune response. Preliminary data on the single dose in adults receiving H1N1 (MF-59) adjuvanted vaccine have been recently published (Clark TW et al., New England Journal of Medicine, 2009 Sep 10, Epub). However these  data  have  not  formally  submitted  at  the  time  of  evaluation.  Moreover  the  antigen  used  in  the polished report has been prepared on the Optaflu platform different form Focetria. However, beside such limitations, the amount of antigen and the amount and production of the adjuvant is the same of Focetria. Safety The observed rate of adverse events was lower than expected. The most frequently experienced local reaction in adults as well as in elderly was pain. The most frequently experienced systemic reactions in adults were myalgia and headache, followed by chills, malaise, arthralgia and fatigue. In elderly the most frequently experienced systemic reactions were myalgia, headache and arthralgia followed by chills, malaise, and fatigue. Local and systemic reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity. The safety profile of the vaccine, as it is revealed by the clinical studies performed, is satisfactory, especially in a pandemic situation. From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

There is currently no specific clinical data available on the use of Focetria in pregnancy. Data from pregnant  women  vaccinated  with  different  inactivated  non-adjuvanted  seasonal  vaccines  do  not suggest malformations or foetal or neonatal toxicity. Serological studies exploring the immunogenicity suggest that antibody response to seasonal influenza vaccine is similar in pregnant women and nonpregnant women. Therefore it is expected that Focetria will be adequately immunogenic in pregnant women.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition the MAH committed to set up a program to monitor pregnancies and related outcomes in women exposed to Focetria during the gestation period as outlined in the Letter of Undertaking and presented in the Risk Management Plan.

Additional information submitted post core-dossier authorisation from a study in 471 children did not raise any new issues for the safety profile of MF-59-adjuvanted vaccine containing the H5N1 strain.

In view of Risk Management, the MAH will submit on a monthly a simplified PSUR on all adverse reactions  notified  by  patients  and  health  care  professionals.    The  Risk  Management  Plan  includes additional  Pharmacovigilance  activities  to  address  important  potential  risks  and  important  missing information. This includes the conduct of a study in Italy with at least 9,000 patients across different age  groups,  recruited  at  the  start  of  the  vaccination  campaign,  a  specific  monitoring  of  special populations such as pregnant women (through pregnancy registry in several EU countries), children and  immunocompromised  subjects,  and  the  monitoring  of  adverse  events  of  special  interest. Effectiveness studies developed and conducted in accordance with the standard protocols published by the ECDC will be performed.

Medicinal product no longer authorised · User consultation The MAH performed readability testing ('user consultation') and a satisfactory report has been provided with the initial MAA. Risk-benefit assessment Benefits The real benefits of Focetria A(H1N1)v can only be assessed by its use during a pandemic. At present the  potential  benefit  can  only  be  evaluated  based  on  detailed  characterisation  of  immunological responses to vaccination with Focetria H5N1. After  two  doses  Focetria  H5N1  administered  21  days  apart  in  adults  and  elderly  the  three  CHMP criteria as laid down in CPMP/VEG/4717/03 have been fulfilled suggesting that the vaccine is suitably immunogenic. Based on data in children 6 months - 17 years, it is expected that two full adult doses given three weeks  apart  will  be  adequately  immunogenic.  Ongoing  studies  with  H1N1  with  both  full  and  half adult dose will provide further information with regards to the dose for children. Extrapolation  of  data  collected  with  (H5N1)  and  other  strains  to  the  influenza  A(H1N1)v  strain  is considered adequate for the population in which the (H5N1) strains have been tested. Therefore the  expected  benefit  of  Focetria  is  to  provide  some  protection  against  clinically-apparent infection  and/or  possibly  against  development  of  severe  disease  in  case  of  an  influenza  A(H1N1)v 2009 infection.

## Risks

Focetria containing a (H5N1) strain is commonly or very commonly associated with a range of local and systemic adverse reactions but these are not often of severe intensity and the safety profile would not preclude the use of the vaccine in the population it has been tested in as described in the SPC.

The  current  safety  database  is  considered  to  be  sufficient  to  describe  adverse  reactions  that  occur uncommonly  and  to  give  an  indication  of  any  rare  events  in  the  population  it  has  been  tested. However, there are some adverse reactions known to be very rarely associated with influenza vaccines and it is  currently  not  possible  to  predict  if  higher  rates  might  be  observed with Focetria compared with, for example, seasonal influenza vaccines.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Data  generated  with  Focetria  including  a  H5N1  strain  cannot  entirely  predict  the  safety  profile  of Focetria including the influenza A(H1N1)v strain since there remains a possibility of ADRs associated with the antigenicity of a specific influenza strain. The specific commitments that accompany the strain change variations, including collection of data from the ongoing and planned clinical studies and as specified in the Risk Management Plans, will provide safety and immunogenicity data on a rolling basis. Balance Based on all the quality safety and efficacy data that supported approval of the corresponding mock-up vaccine together with quality data specific to the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)v strain it is considered that in the current pandemic situation the benefits outweigh the risks that may be associated with the use of the vaccine in accordance with the SPC. Recommendation On the basis of the available data for Focetria A(H1N1)v which is limited primarily to quality data and the  data  of  the  initially  authorised  medicinal  product  Focetria  H5N1,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Focetria  H1N1  for  the  prophylaxis  of  influenza  in  an officially declared pandemic situation, in accordance with official guidance, was favourable. Therefore CHMP recommended the variation to the marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances in accordance  with  Article  8  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  1085/2003  to  the  terms  of  the Marketing  Authorisation  until  specific  conditions  as  defined  in  Annex  II.C  (points  1  and  2)  are fulfilled.
