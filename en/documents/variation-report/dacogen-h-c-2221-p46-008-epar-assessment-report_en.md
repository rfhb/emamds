## 1. Introduction

On 16 February 2016, the MAH submitted the final study report of a completed paediatric study E773G000-202 for decitabine, in context of Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The MAH acknowledges that this Article 46 submission is outside of the usual six months period after completion of a pediatric study. Indeed, the end of trial date for this study was 19 th July 2013 (final clinical cut-off date).

The MAH submitted two separate CSR:

- an interim CSR dated on 19 th  January 2012
- an CSR Addendum dated on 23 rd  September 2015.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The  MAH  stated  that  Study  E7373-G000-202  'A  Randomized,  Open-Label,  Multicenter  Study  to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Decitabine as Epigenetic Priming With Induction Chemotherapy in Pediatric  Acute  Myelogenous  Leukemia  (AML)  Subjects'  was  conducted  exclusively  by  its  business partner, Eisai Inc and is not part of the MAH development programme.

As such this study is considered a stand-alone study and is not listed as a clinical measure in the MAH PIP for Dacogen.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

NA

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The assessment is essentially based on the resulted in the CSR Addendum dated on 23 rd  September 2015 for Study E7373-G000-202 'A Randomized, Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Decitabine as Epigenetic Priming With Induction Chemotherapy in Pediatric Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) Subjects.' (named Daco-202 in this report).

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Description

It is hypothesized that pretreatment (i.e., priming) with a hypomethylating agent will increase the efficacy of induction chemotherapy for AML. In this study DACO-202, decitabine was studied as an epigenetic priming agent using the regimen of a 1-hour intravenous (IV) infusion of 20 mg/m2 once daily for 5 days, immediately before induction chemotherapy. This dosage was chosen based on (1)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the large amount of safety data collected on the regimen in clinical trials in adults, and (2) data that show a 1-hour infusion of decitabine 20 mg/m2 is sufficient to inhibit DNA methyltransferase and induce tumor suppressor gene activation as early as 3 to 5 days after treatment initiation. This study aimed to provide data on the activity of a standard induction regimen (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide) plus epigenetic priming with decitabine as assessed by standard measures of morphologic CR, leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS), and incidence of minimal residual disease (MRD).

## Methods

## Objectives

## Primary objective:

- To evaluate the short-term efficacy of decitabine when used as priming before induction chemotherapy in pediatric subjects with AML

## Secondary objectives:

- To evaluate the safety of decitabine
- To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of decitabine
- To evaluate DNA methylation and exploratory biomarkers in pediatric subjects with AML receiving decitabine priming before induction chemotherapy
- To evaluate time to platelet recovery (≥ 100,000/mm3) and neutrophil recovery (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] ≥ 1000/mm3) after induction chemotherapy
- To evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD) in pediatric subjects with AML receiving decitabine priming
- before induction chemotherapy
- To evaluate the long-term efficacy of decitabine

## Exploratory objective:

- To to evaluate potential biomarkers predictive of a positive therapeutic response in pediatric subjects with AML receiving decitabine priming before induction chemotherapy

## Study design

This is a multicenter, randomized, two-arm, open-label, parallel design study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 1 Three-Phase Study Design for Study DACO-202

<!-- image -->

25 subjects were enrolled in one of two arms in a 1:1 ratio:

- Arm A (investigational treatment): Subjects received decitabine priming for 5 days, followed by standard induction chemotherapy of daunorubicin, cytarabine, and etoposide for 10 days
- Arm B (control, reference treatment): Subjects received standard induction chemotherapy of daunorubicin, cytarabine, and etoposide for 10 days

The two treatment arms were stratified by age before randomization per ICH and FDA guidance: 1 to &lt;2 years, 2 to 11 years, and 12 to 16 years.

## Study population /Sample size

## Study population

A total of 40 pediatric subjects with AML were selected across 22 sites. As of the final cut off date (19 th July 2013), 25 subjects were enrolled at 11 sites and completed treatment.

## Inclusion Criteria

1. Males and females, age 1 to 16 years, inclusive
2. Females of childbearing potential had to have a negative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) at screening, a negative urine pregnancy test before starting study treatment, and agree to be abstinent or to use a highly effective method of contraceptionfor at least one menstrual cycle before starting study treatment and until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.
3. Sexually mature male subjects who were not abstinent or had not undergone a successful vasectomy, and who were partners of females of childbearing potential had to use, or their partners had to use, a highly effective method of contraception starting for at least one menstrual cycle before starting study treatment and until at least 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.

13. Was hypersensitive to decitabine, daunorubicin, cytarabine, or etoposide
14. Participated in a drug trial in the last 4 weeks

## Sample Size

No statistical justification of the sample size was provided for this exploratory study. The statistical plan estimated that a sample size of 40 subjects would provide a reasonable estimate for the difference in CR rate between Arm A (Investigational Arm) and Arm B (Control Arm).

## Treatments

## Arm A Only:

- Decitabine 20 mg/m2 via 1-h intravenous (IV) infusion daily for 5 days (Days 1 to 5)

Arm A (after completion of decitabine) and Arm B (in sequential order of administration):

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Intrathecal cytarabine administered at the time of diagnostic lumbar puncture according to agebased dosing: 1 to &lt;2 years, 30 mg; ≥2 to &lt;3 years, 50 mg; ≥3 years, 70 mg
- Daunorubicin 50 mg/m2 (1.67 mg/kg if body surface area [BSA] &lt;0.6 m2) 6-h IV infusion every

## other day over a 5-day period for a total of 3 infusions (Days 6, 8, 10 [Arm A] or Days 1, 3, 5 [Arm B]) · Cytarabine 100 mg/m2 (3.3 mg/kg if BSA &lt;0.6 m2) slow IV push (over 15 minutes) every 12 h x 10 days (Days 6 to 15 [Arm A] or Days 1 to 10 [Arm B]) · Etoposide 100 mg/m2 (3.3 mg/kg if BSA &lt;0.6 m2) 4-h IV infusion x 5 days (Days 6 to 10 [Arm A] or Days 1 to 5 [Arm B]) Duration of Treatment : Arm A: 15 days (5 days' of decitabine plus 10 days' of induction chemotherapy) Arm B: 10 days (induction chemotherapy only)

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Endpoints

## Primary efficacy endpoint :

The primary efficacy parameter was the morphologic CR rate.

The criteria for determining disease response are detailed in the protocol and were based upon the criteria established by the International Working Group (IWG) in 2003. Definitions for the response categories are summarized as follows:

- Morphologic complete remission: Requires that the subject achieved a morphologic leukemia-free state and had an ANC &gt;1000/µL and platelets &gt;100,000/µL. Hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit had no bearing on remission status, although the patient had to be independent of transfusions.
- Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery: Subjects who fulfilled all the criteria for CR except for residual neutropenia (&lt;1000/µL) or thrombocytopenia (&lt;100,000/µL).
- Partial remission (PR): Requires all hematologic values as for a CR, but with a decrease of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts to 5% to 25% in the bone marrow aspirate. A value of &lt;5% blasts was also considered a PR if any blasts with Auer rods were present.
- Aplastic/hypoplastic marrow (leukemia not detected): Requires &lt;5% blasts in the aspirate sample with marrow spicules, with a count of ≥200 nucleated cells. There was persistence of extramedullary disease; no blasts with Auer rods could be present.

• Leukemia not in remission or treatment failure: Subjects who achieved less than a PR.

- Recurrence or morphologic relapse: Defined as the reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood or &gt;5% blasts in the bone marrow not attributable to any other cause. The reappearance or development of cytologically proven extramedullary disease also indicated relapse.

The number and percentage of subjects who achieved a confirmed CR in each treatment arm were summarized, along with the corresponding 95% two-sided exact confidence interval (CI). Fisher ' s exact test was used for testing treatment effect. Complete remission was calculated for the FA population as the primary analysis. Complete remission was also calculated for the PP population.

## Secondary efficacy endpoints :

- Time to CR

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Time to platelet recovery (≥ 100,000/mm3) and time to neutrophil recovery (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] ≥ 1000/mm3) after induction chemotherapy
- Minimal residual disease (MRD) following induction chemotherapy
- Leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS)
- DNA methylation following decitabine treatment

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmarcodynamics

- Standard parameters of PK profile of decitabine in Arm A on Day 5 immediately before and at 30 minutes, 60 minutes (immediately before the end of infusion), 65, 90, 120 and 180 minutes after the infusion.
- Biomarkers of genomewide patterns of DNA methylation

## Safety endpoints:

- Extent of exposure
- AEs,
- Clinical laboratory evaluation
- Vital signs, physical findings and other safety measurements

## Statistical Methods

## Four populations were analyzed

Full Analysis (FA) Population included all subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment and who had at least one postdose efficacy measurement for response.

Per Protocol (PP) Population included subjects who sufficiently complied with the protocol.

Safety Population was the group of subjects who signed informed consent, received treatment, and had at least one postdose safety assessment.

Pharmacokinetic Population consisted of all patients who have at least one post-dose evaluable PK sample available.

## CHMP assessment comment:

Global study design as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria are acceptable for this phase 2 exploratory study.

## CHMP assessment comment:

The study was overall well conducted; the dropout rate (4%, 1/25) is low. Forty subjects were planned for this study. However, the study was terminated prematurely after 25 subjects due to slow enrollment and the futility of observing a difference in remission rate between treatments arms following DSMB recommendation.

Overall, the median age of subjects were 8 years, 80% of them were white subjects. Only one subject in the 1 to 2-year age stratum was enrolled and assigned in the Arm B.

## Baseline disease characteristics and cancer history:

All 25 subjects had confirmed de novo AML, a total of 21 subjects (84%) had &gt;20% bone marrow blasts at baseline (Arm A: 9/11, 81.8% versus Arm B: 12/14 85.7%). The median time from diagnosis of AML to study entry was 2.0 days (range 0-4 days) and was the same for both arms. The most common FAB classification was M2 (8/25, 32%) which was more frequently in arm B than in arm A (n=6 42.9% versus n=2 18.2%).

Source: Table 14.2.1.1.4.

As shown in tables 8, 3 of the 11 subjects (27.3%) in Arm A and 7 of 14 subjects (50.0%) in Arm B achieved a CR in Study DACO-202. In Arm A, 1 subject did not achieve leukemic remission (ie, treatment failure), 1 subject did not complete induction chemotherapy due to a serious adverse event, and 6 subjects achieved a morphologic CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi). The total remission rate (CR+CRi) for Arm A was 81.8%. In Arm B, 1 subject had a partial response and 1 subject had aplastic marrow at the completion of induction chemotherapy; the total remission rate (CR+CRi) was 85.7%.

The response rates (CR+CRi) between Arms A and B were similar for both subjects age 2 to 11 years and subjects age 12 to 16 years. In Arm A, which included decitabine priming, the response rate (CR+CRi) was numerically higher among subjects in the younger age group (2 to 11 years; n=6/7, 85.7%) compared with those in the older age group (12 to 16 years; n=3/4, 75.0%). However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of subjects in each age group.

Myeloblast count: The median bone marrow myeloblast count at Baseline was 62.5% in Arm A and 58.5% in Arm B. Three weeks after the last dose of induction chemotherapy, median myeloblast counts were 1.5% and 1.0% in Arms A and B, respectively. This corresponds to a change from baseline of -52.4% and -55.0% for Arms A and B, respectively.

## CHMP assessment comment:

Only one subject enrolled was younger than 2 years, analysis was limited to the 2 older age groups (211 and 12-16 years old).

The morphologic CR was lower in Arm A than in Arm B (3/11 27.3% versus 7/14, 50%). The total remission rate (CR+CRi) seems similar between two arms (81.8% in Arm A versus 85.7% in Arm B. In the Arm A, the response rate seems higher in subjects aged 2 to 11 years than older subjects aged 12 to 16 years (85.7% versus 75%).

The table 14.1.7.1 'Hematology at Baseline' showed that subjects in Arm A had lower baseline ANC value. Many of these subjects had delayed recovery in ANC counts. These differences were considered clinically relevant by the sponsor, and may have contributed to the lower CR rate and higher incidence of cytopenias (higher CRi) observed in Arm A as compared with Arm B. However due to the small

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sample size in each group, these results should be interpreted with caution and no firm conclusion could be drawn from this study.

## Secondary Efficacy endpoints:

## Time to Complete remission

The median time to CR from the date of randomization was 43 days for subjects in Arm A and 37 days for subjects in Arm B. The median time to remission (CR+CRi) was 41 days for subjects in Arm A and 33 days for subjects in Arm B.

## CHMP assessment comment:

Clinical response was evaluated at the same time point (Visit 6, Day 35) during the study for 2 arms. Given the 5 days of decitabine treatment prior to the start of induction chemotherapy for subjects in Arm A, the median time to response between the treatment arms was comparable.

The median time to neutrophil recovery (ANC ≥1,000/mm3) from the date of randomization was longer for subjects in Arm A compared with subjects in Arm B (25 versus 18.0 days). The median time to platelet recovery (≥100,000/mm3) from the date of randomization was longer for subjects in Arm A compared with Arm B (22 versus 14.5 days).

## CHMP assessment comment:

The median time to both neutrophil and platelet recovery was approximately 8 days longer for subjects in Arm A than in Arm B. These differences in recovery time may be in part due to the additional 5 days of decitabine treatment for subjects in Arm A, which would appear to delay recovery time when measured at a fixed timepoint (Visit 6 for all subjects).

It is important to note that subjects may have received platelet transfusion and the baseline ANC value were lower in Arm A, which could also affect time to counts.

Here again, these results should be interpreted with caution due to small size of subjects in each arm.

## CHMP assessment comment:

Only six subjects assigned to treatment Arm A had viable MRD measurement at baseline and at endof-treatment. No subjects in Arm B had viable sample. Five of 6 subjects in Arm A were MRD+ at baseline and showed MRD levels below the threshold of detection at end-of-treatment. All of these subjects achieved a morphological CR. None of comparative conclusion between 2 arms can be drawn from these results.

## Leukemia-free survival and Overall Survival

As of the clinical cutoff date, 6 subjects had died (3 subjects each in arm), all more than 30 days posttreatment; 18 subjects were still alive (1 subject who had achieved a CR at Visit 6 had relapse of leukemia and was still alive).

## CHMP assessment comment:

There were insufficient data as of the clinical cutoff date to perform an analysis of LFS. Median OS could not be estimated.

## Pharmacokinetics

Plasma concentration of decitabine were quantifiable in all 11 decitabine-treated subjects up to the last time point of 180 minutes. Selected PK parameters of decitabine in overall pediatric subjects and by age group are shown in Table 13. Mean plasma concentration-time profile on linear scale is presented in Figure 5.

Postinfusion, plasma concentrations declined in a bi-exponential manner.

Mean (SD) PK values for the 11 decitabine-treated subjects were: Cmax, 294 (104) ng/mL; AUC0-∞ , 215 (72.5) ng · h/mL; CL, 128 (92.3) L/h; Vdss, 45.5 (41.1) L; t ½ , 0.453 (0.0804) h; tmax, 0.831 h (0.253).

## CHMP assessment comment:

Intersubject variability in PK values was higher than expected, but did not appear to be age related given the limited number of subjects.

## Pharmacodynamics

Results for pharmacodynamics assessments such as DNA methylation, biomarker identification, mRNA expression, clonogenic assay are not found in this CSR.

## CHMP assessment comment

Efficacy summary based on the efficacy results from 25 pediatric subjects (n=11 in Arm A and n=14 in Arm B):

There were no apparent differences in remission rates (CR+CRi) between subjects in Arm A who received decitabine priming, and subjects in Arm B, who received only induction chemotherapy. Response rates (CR+CRi) as of the Visit 6 timepoint (3 weeks post-chemiotherapy) were similar between treatment arms (81.8% [n=9/11] for Arm A and 85.7% [n=12/14]) for Arm B). However, a numerically higher CR rate was noted in Arm B (Arm A, 27.3%; Arm B, 50.0%). The significantly lower baseline ANC values in Arm A could partially contribute to the lower CR rate and higher incidence of CRi in Arm A.

Median times to ANC and platelet recovery appeared to be approximately 8 days longer in Arm A than Arm B. These differences in recovery time may be in part due to the additional 5 days of decitabine treatment for subjects in Arm A, which would appear to delay recovery time when measured at a fixed timepoint (Visit 6 for all subjects).

Seven subjects had leukemic relapse or death at the clinical cutoff date; there was no relevant difference between the 2 treatment arms.

Intersubject variability in PK values was higher than expected, but did not appear to be age related given the limited number of subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall efficacy results should be interpreted with caution due to small size of subjects in each arm.

## Safety results

All  subjects  in  Arm  A  completed  1  cycle  of  5-Day  decitabine  treatment;  no  subjects  treated  with decitabine had a dose modification.

The number of chemotherapy infusions and median relative dose intensities for each chemotherapeutic agent were similar between the treatment arms, except for cytarabine. Subjects in Arm B received on average 1 day more of treatment with cytarabine, with a dose intensity approximately 83 mg/m2/week higher, compared with subjects in Arm A. These results appear to be due to the results of 1 subject in Arm A, who received only 1 dose of cytarabine.

## Treatment-emergent Adverse Events

All 25 subjects had at least 1 TEAE.

NA = not applicable; TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event; TRT = treatment-related toxicity. TRT only assessed for decitabine.

a: TRT in Arm A was defined as a nonresolving Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic or hematologic toxicity, or time to platelet recovery (≥  100,000/mm 3 )  and  neutrophil  recovery  (≥  1000/mm 3 )  that  continued  beyond  55  days  following  the  last  day  of  induction chemotherapy, in the absence of leukemia.

b: 1 subject (1006-1004) did not attain remission during the treatment period of the study. Source:  Tables 14.3.1 and 14.3.2.

The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs,  occurring  in  50%  or  more  of  subjects  overall,  were  vomiting (n=15/ [60%]); anemia, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and white blood cell count decreased, each of which occurred in 14 of the 25 subjects (56.0%); and nausea (n=13/25, 52%). These TEAEs were consistent  with  the  subjects'  underlying  AML  diagnosis  and  the  known  safety  profiles  of  study treatment.

Treatment-emergent AEs that occurred in at least four more subjects in Arm A (decitabine) than in Arm B included decreased appetite (Arm A, n=9 [81.8%]; Arm B n=5 [35.7%]), constipation (Arm A, n=7  [63.6%];  Arm  B,  n=2  [14.3%]),  hypotension  (Arm  A,  n=7  [63.6%];  Arm  B,  n=1  [7.1%]), catheter site erythema (Arm A, n=6 [54.5%]; Arm B, n=2, [14.3%]), and catheter site hemorrhage (Arm A, n=3 [27.3%]; Arm B, n=0).

Adverse events that occurred in at least three more subjects in Arm B than in Arm A (in decreasing order of frequency) were febrile neutropenia (57.1% vs. 27.3%), weight decreased (35.7% vs. 27.3%), epistaxis (35.7% vs. 9.1%), neutrophil count decreased (35.7% vs. 0), oropharyngeal pain (28.6% vs. 9.1%), and ear pain (21.4% vs. 0).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Eight  subjects  (72.7%)  had  a  TEAE  reported  as  related  to  decitabine  by  the  investigator.  Causal relationship was not captured for the chemotherapy alone.

## Treatment-Related Toxicity

One decitabine-treated subject had a treatment-related toxicity (TRT). Subject 1015-1001 had Grade 3 decreased WBC (protocol-defined TRT) on Day 7 and Grade 3 anemia on Day 24. Both events were reported by the investigator to be possibly related to decitabine. However, neither event was reported as serious and no action was taken. The subject had not recovered at the time this CSR was prepared.

## Grade 3-4 Adverse Events

All but 2 subjects had at least 1 Grade 3-4 TEAE: 11/11 in arm A, 12/14 in arm B.

The  most  frequently  reported  Grade  3-4  AEs,  occurring  in  25%  or  more  of  subjects  overall,  were anaemia (n=14/25, 56.0%), white blood cell count decreased (n=14/25, 56.0%), febrile neutropenia (n=11/25,  44.0%),  platelet  count  decreased  (n=10/25,  40.0%),  and  thrombocytopenia  (n=8/25, 32.0%).  These  TEAEs  are  all  consistent  with  the  subjects'  underlying  disease  or  the  known  safety profile of study treatment.

Severe TEAEs that occurred in at least three more subjects in Arm A than in Arm B were hypokalaemia (36.4% vs. 7.1%) and decreased appetite (27.3% vs. 0). Severe TEAEs that occurred in at least three more subjects in Arm B than in Arm A were febrile neutropenia (57.1% vs. 27.3%), neutrophil count decreased (35.7% vs. 0), and stomatitis (21.4% vs. 0).

No Grade 5 events occurred in this study.

## Serious Adverse Events

Two subjects in Arm A had serious TEAEs. One subject had 2 SAEs (appendicitis and large intestine perforation)  on  Study  Day  6  that  led  to  treatment  discontinuation.  The  second  subject  had  lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage. One subject in Arm B had an SAE of sepsis on Day 35, after completing

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the course of study treatment. The investigator rated the event as moderate and the subject recovered. None of the SAES were reported by the investigator as being related to study treatment. There were no AEs that led to decitabine dose modification (interruption/delay/reduction).

None of the 11 subjects in Arm A had a decitabine dose modification.

One  subject  (1018-1001)  had  two  SAEs,  appendicitis  and  large  intestine  perforation,  which  led  to treatment discontinuation on Study Day 6. There were no AEs that led to dose modification.

## Deaths

There were no induction-related deaths. No deaths occurred during the treatment period or within 30 days after last dose. However, six deaths did occur posttreatment, 3 in each arm.

AML = acute myelogenous leulkemia, BMT = bone marrow transplant; EOT = end of treatment, NR =not recorded.

All six subjects completed their assigned study treatment.

a:All deaths occuwred more than 30 days posttreatment.

Souce:

Listings 16.2.1,16.2.15, 16.2.16,amd 16.2.26.

All six deaths occurred more than 30 days after the subjects' last dose of study treatment. There did not appear to be any differences between treatment arms in either the timing or causes of death.

For two subjects, death was attributed to progressive disease (i.e., AML). Two deaths were attributed to 'other' reasons, namely multiorgan system failure. One subject died of complications due to bone marrow transplant approximately 7 months after EOT of this study. The sixth subject (1006-1004) died of  an  adverse drug reaction (ADR) to additional anticancer treatment approximately 8 months after EOT.

## Clinical Laboratory Evaluation

Of note, two subjects in Arm A did not have baseline lab values recorded. Subjects in Arm A had lower mean  and  median  ANC  values,  and  lower  mean  platelet  count,  compared  with  those  in  Arm  B  at Baseline. Furthermore, while minimum ANC and platelet count values were similar between treatment arms, Arm B had much higher maximum values. Median baseline chemistry laboratory values were similar between treatment arms in the FAS.

ANC = absolute neuhrophil count; max =maximum; min = minimum.

Baseline laboratory values were not recorded for 2 subjects in Arm A; AML diagnosis was made based on actual pathology reading.

Souce: Table 14.l.7.1.

03SEP2013

Postbaseline  Changes  in  Laboratory  Values: Mean  serum  chemistry  values  appeared  to  fluctuate  or increase over time in both treatment arms. In general, Arm A had higher mean alkaline phosphatase values at most time points. Mean creatinine levels increased over the course of the study in Arm A, but not in Arm B. No other meaningful changes were observed (including potassium).

Hematology : Grade 3-4 baseline hematologic values were similar between treatment arms, except for ANC. Eight subjects (72.7%) in Arm A compared with four subjects (28.6%) in Arm B had Grade 3-4 ANC values at Baseline, consistent with the known variability in disease severity.

Shifts  from  normal (Grade 0) or Grade 1 at Baseline to either Grade 3 or 4 during treatment were observed more frequently in Arm B than in Arm A for hemoglobin (Arm A: n=1/9, 11.1%; Arm B: n=3/14, 21.4%), lymphocytes (Arm A: n=1/9, 11.1%; Arm B: n=8/14, 57.1%), ANC (Arm A: n=1/9, 11.1%; Arm B: n=9/14, 64.3%), and leukocytes (Arm A: n=5/9, 55.6%; Arm B: n=11/14, 78.6%). The  intergroup  differences  in  shifts  in  lymphocyte,  leukocyte,  and  ANC  values  may  be  clinically meaningful, however, the number of subjects is small.

All  subjects  in  the  Safety  population  with  baseline  data  had  at  least  one  postbaseline  hematologic laboratory abnormality that was rated Grade 3 or 4. However, none were deemed serious or led to discontinuation of treatment. The incidence of Grade 3-4 lymphocyte count was higher in Arm B (n=8, 88.9%)  than  in  Arm  A  (n=1,  14.3%).  No  other  clinically  meaningful  intergroup  differences  were observed for total incidence of Grade 3-4 hematologic laboratory abnormalities.

One subject in Arm A had protocol-defined treatment-related toxicity, namely Grade 3 decreased WBC. Profound neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are expected events during induction chemotherapy.

Percentages based on total number of subjects with both nonmissing baseline and posibaseline values.

a: Only laboratory parameters with Grade 3-4 postbaseline values are displayed.

b: Two subjects in Arm A had missing baseline hematology values; therefore, the denominator is based on 9 subjects.

Source: Tables 14.3.7.5 and 14.3.7.6.

Serum Chemistry: One subject in Arm A had a Grade 4 potassium value at Baseline, which was also Grade 4 during decitabine treatment, but resolved to Grade 0 on Day 6. One subject in Arm B had a Grade 3 glucose value at Baseline, which was also Grade 3 on Day 2 and Visit 6, but Grade 0 or 1 at all other time points during treatment, including the end-of-treatment visit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No other Grade 3-4 values for serum chemistry parameters were observed at Baseline. Shifts from normal (Grade 0) or Grade 1 at Baseline to either Grade 3 or 4 during treatment were observed for ALT (Arm A: n=0; Arm B: n=2), AST (Arm A: n=0; Arm B: n=1), glucose (Arm A: n=0; Arm B: n=1), and potassium (Arm A: n=1; Arm B: n=0). There did not appear to be any meaningful differences between treatment arms.

A total of 8 subjects (Arm A: n=5/11, 45.4%; Arm B: n=3/14 21.4%) had one or more postbaseline Grade 3-4 serum chemistry values. The most frequently occurring serum chemistry abnormality was low potassium. Overall, 10 subjects (Arm A: n=7/11, 63.6%; Arm B: n=3/14, 21.4%) had low (Grade 1-4) postbaseline potassium values. These were Grade 3-4 in seven subjects (28%) overall, and the incidence was higher in Arm A than in Arm B (Arm A: n=6/11, 54.5%; Arm B: n=1/14, 7.1%). These findings  are  consistent  with  sequelae  of  chemotherapy  as  well  as  those  previously  observed  with decitabine  in  adult  subjects  with  AML  (Study  DACO-016;  where  13.8%  vs.  8.2%  of  subjects  in  the decitabine  and  TC  arms,  respectively,  had  a  shift  in  potassium  level  from  Grade  0-2  at  Baseline  to Grade 3-4 during treatment).

Grade 3-4 low potassium values were the most frequently reported serum chemistry abnormalities. Hypokalemia was monitored by the sponsor throughout the study, and were presented to the DSMB following  discussions  with  the  principal  investigators.  Hypokalemia  was  most  likely  due  to  GI disturbances and  electrolyte imbalances  from  chemotherapy-induced  vomiting;  all cases  were manageable with supportive care, such as potassium supplementation or parenteral nutrition.

No Grade 3-4 changes in bilirubin or creatinine were reported.

## Vital signs

There were no meaningful differences in mean or median values between treatment arms for any vital sign  parameter.  No  significant  trends  were  noted  in  mean  blood  pressure,  pulse,  respiration  rate, weight, or body temperature from Baseline over time for either of the treatment arms.

Vital sign findings were considered by the sponsor to be clinically significant if they were severe (Grade 3 or 4), reported as serious, or led to treatment discontinuation. Overall, vital sign parameters were reported as a TEAE as follows: pyrexia (n=8), hypotension (including the preferred term 'orthostatic hypotension')  (n=8)  and  hypertension  (n=3).  All  of  these  were  mild  or  moderate,  except  for  one subject in Arm A who had multiple episodes of Grade 3 hypotension and one subject in Arm B who had Grade  3  pyrexia.  Changes  in  blood  pressure  were  reported  as  TEAEs  by  the  investigator  more frequently in Arm A than in Arm B.

## Electrocardiogram Data

Electrocardiograms were not performed routinely per protocol in this study.  However, some cardiac TEAEs  were  recorded.  Tachycardia  and  sinus  tachycardia  were  reported  more  frequently  in  Arm  A (n=6, 54.5%) compared with Arm B (n=2, 14.3%). All of the recorded events were rated Grade 1 or 'mild' except for one subject in Arm A who had Grade 3 tachycardia on Study Day 16 in association with Grade 3 febrile neutropenia (onset Day 15), Grade 3 hypotension (onset Day 16), and serious Grade  3  lower  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  (onset  Day  16).  The  subject  recovered  from  all  of  the events, which the investigator reported as being not related to study treatment.

## CHMP assessment comment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All patients in both treatment arms presented at least 1 TEAE.

AE reported in at least 50 % of the patients, both treatment arms included, are in line with the known safety profile of decitabine and associated chemotherapy (cytarabine, daunorubicine, etoposide).

Safety profiles appeared similar in both arms, despite higher incidence of severe hypokalaemia (36.4% vs. 7.1%) and decreased appetite (27.3% vs. 0) in decitabine arm.

All subjects had at least 1 Grade 3-4 TEAE in arm A, and 85% of the patients in arm B.

There was no treatment-related death.

3 patients presented serious AE, none assessed as treatment related:

-  2  in  arm  A:  1  patient  with  appendicitis  and  large  intestine  perforation,  leading  to  chemotherapy interruption, and &amp; patient with gastrointestinal haemorrhage.

- 1 in arm B: sepsis at D35.

Clinical  Laboratory  Evaluation,  vital  signs  and  electrocardiogramms  did  not  raise  safety  signal  in decitabine arm in paediatric population.

Based on data provided, no safety signal was raised and reported AE are in line with the known safety profile of decitabine.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The results from the Study Daco-202, a Phase 2 multicenter study of decitabine epigenetic priming prior to induction chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in children with AML showed:

- There were no apparent differences in remission rates (CR+CRi) between subjects in Arm A who received decitabine priming and subjects in Arm B, who received only induction chemotherapy. However, a numerically higher CR rate was noted in Arm B (Arm A, 27.3%; Arm B 50.0%).
- Median times to ANC and platelet recovery appeared to be approximately 8 days longer in Arm A than Arm B. This longer time to blood count recovery may be due at least in part to the additional 5 days of decitabine treatment in Arm A.

The significantly lower baseline ANC values in Arm A may also contribute to the lower CR rate and longer recovery time in Arm A.

- The incidence of remission failure at Visit 6 was similar between the two treatment arms.
- Seven subjects had leukemic relapse or death at the clinical cutoff date; there was no relevant difference between the two treatment arms.
- High intersubject variability in decitabine PK parameters was observed; however, there did not appear to be an age-related trend among the limited number of subjects.
- Safety profiles appeared similar in both arms, despite higher incidence of severe hypokalaemia (36.4% vs. 7.1%) and decreased appetite (27.3% vs. 0) in decitabine arm.
- There were no induction-related deaths

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- No safety signal was raised and reported AE are in line with the known safety profile of decitabine.

## 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

The addition of decitabine pretreatment had no effect on clinical response rates or MRD results when compared with chemotherapy alone. The increased time to response and time to blood cell count recovery for subjects pretreated with decitabine was likely the result of the additional 5-day period before induction chemotherapy was started for subjects in decitabine Arm A.

No safety signal was raised and reported AE are in line with the known safety profile of decitabine.

Overall, it is agreed with the MAH that the data from Study E7373-G000-202 alone do not influence the benefit-risk balance and therfore no SPC changes are deemed necessary for Dacogen at this time.
