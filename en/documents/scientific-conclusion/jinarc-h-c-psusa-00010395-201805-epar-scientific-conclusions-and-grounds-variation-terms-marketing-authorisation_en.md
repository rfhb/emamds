## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for 'tolvaptan (indicated for adults with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

The Marketing Authorisation Holder is requested to update the product information to add 'Gout' as a common adverse event in section 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and in section 4 of the Patient Information Leaflet (PL). This is not a new signal. The SmPC already describes in section 4.4 how tolvaptan is known to decrease uric acid clearance in the kidney, and in clinical trials this resulted in higher rates of clinically significant uric acid levels (greater than 10mg/dL) with tolvaptan compared to placebo (6.2% vs 1.7%). Adverse reactions of gout were reported more frequently with tolvaptan than with placebo (2.9% vs 1.4%). The PL currently warns in section 2 that patients should talk to their doctor if they have previously had high level of uric acid which may have caused gout attacks. The recommended updates are to make the distinction that hyperuricaemia and gout are different clinical entities, and that hyperuricaemia may be asymptomatic. The term 'gout' is also more easily understood by patients.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for 'tolvaptan (indicated for adults with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing 'tolvaptan (indicated for adults with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
