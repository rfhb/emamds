Submission of final results of study HZA115150 (SLS-Asthma, Salford Asthma); this is an interventional post-authorisation safety Category 1 study to further investigate the risk of pneumonia (ANX005). Consequently, Annex II condition of the product information is updated. Moreover, an updated RMP version 10 is submitted to add information from the study, to update the important identified risk of pneumonia based on findings from the study, and to provide justifications for removal of the important potential risk of asthma related intubations and deaths and of missing information related to long term use in asthma (>1 year).

| WS/1208             | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Extension of Indication for Relvar Ellipta and Revinty Ellipta to include treatment of patients with asthma already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2-agonist. As a consequence, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | 25/01/2018 | 05/03/2018 | SmPC | A randomised, double-blind, parallel group, 24 week study (201378) was conducted to demonstrate non-inferiority (using a margin of -100 mL for trough FEV1) of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 once daily to salmeterol/FP 50/250 twice daily in adults and adolescents whose asthma was well controlled following 4 weeks of treatment with open- label salmeterol/FP 50/250 twice daily (N=1504). Subjects randomised to once-daily FF/VI maintained lung function comparable with those randomised to twice-daily salmeterol/FP [difference in trough FEV1 of +19 mL (95% CI: -11, 49)]. This study support the extension of indication in the subpopulation of patients with asthma adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2-agonist.

Type II C.I.4: Update of sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update the safety information and include data from the HZC113782 (SUMMIT) study (designed to investigate whether FF/VI- Furoate/Vilanterol could improve survival in patients with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who had, or were at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CV)). The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated accordingly. The RMP v.9 is updated accordingly. | 21/04/2017 | 21/09/2017 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | SUMMIT was a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind study evaluating the effect on survival of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms compared with placebo in 16,485 subjects. The primary endpoint was all- cause mortality and a secondary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular events. Prior to randomization, subjects were required to discontinue previous COPD medications used at baseline. Subjects were then randomized to receive either fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms, fluticasone furoate 92 micrograms, vilanterol 22 micrograms, or placebo, and treated for a mean of 1.7 years (SD = 0.9 years). Subjects had moderate COPD (mean percent post-bronchodilator screening FEV1 of 60% [SD = 6%]), and a history of, or an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. |

The risk of the cardiovascular composite event with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol was not significantly different compared with placebo (HR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.14), fluticasone furoate (HR 1.03; 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.28) or vilanterol (HR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.76 to 1.16). For more information on the SUMMIT study, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells from subjects with COPD, a larger anti-inflammatory effect was seen in the presence of the combination of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol compared with fluticasone furoate alone at concentrations achieved with clinical doses. The enhanced anti-inflammatory effect of the LABA component was similar to that obtained with other ICS/LABA   |
