## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval of Busilvex. For information on changes after approval please refer to module 8.

## 1. Introduction

Pierre  Fabre  Médicament submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application for a medicinal product containing the active substance busulfan in a concentrate for solution for infusion. This application has been  submitted  as  so-called  \"bibliographical  application\",  in  accordance  with  directive  65/65/EEC, article 4.8 (a) ii. Hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation Autologous  stem  cell  transplantation  involves  the  reinfusion  of  the  patient's  own  stem  cells, previously  harvested  and  cryopreserved  in  liquid  nitrogen,  to  reconstitute  the  haematopoietic  cell function after the administration of high-dose therapy. The infused stem cells are obtained from the patient's bone marrow or peripheral blood at a time when the marrow displays minimal or no disease infiltration. Therefore, immunologic transplantation barriers do not exist but, theoretically, the tumour contamination of the graft may increase the relapse rate. Allogeneic  transplantation  entails  the  transfer  of  stem  cells  from  a  donor  to  another  person.  This differs from autologous transplantation in that the potential exists for immune rejection of the infused stem cells by the recipient (hostversus -graft effect) and the immune attack of the donor's cells against some target tissues in the recipient (graftversus -host disease). However, it has become apparent that in the allogeneic transplant setting, the immunocompetent cells infused with the stem cells, or arising from them, exert a potent graftversus -tumour (GVT) effect independent of the effects of the highdose therapy. Cure  rates  vary,  but  they  range  from  as  high  as  80%  for  patients  with  chronic  myeloid  leukaemia treated  during  chronic  phase,  to  only  15-20%  for  patients  with  acute  leukaemia  refractory  to conventional  chemotherapy.  Additionally,  patients  with  non-malignant  disorders  such  as  severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), inborn errors of metabolism, and haemoglobinopathies may also benefit from allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The last published European Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) survey on transplant activity in 1999 recorded a total of 21,430 transplants, with a rate of 6.6/100.000 inhabitants, performed by 580  teams  in  35  European  countries.  Of  these  transplants,  18,720  were  first  transplants,  (31% allogeneic and 69% autologous), 905 were second transplants (53% allogeneic and 47% autologous) and 1,805 double or triple transplants (5% allogeneic and 95% autologous). Ninety-five percent of the autologous  transplants  and  45%  of  the  allogeneic  transplants  were  peripheral  blood  stem  cell transplants.  A  total  of  103,  respectively  1,8%  of  the  allogeneic  transplants  was  cord  blood  cell transplants. The age of the patient is a compelling factor in the decision to perform a transplant. Patients over 50 years of age are less likely to have a favourable outcome after transplantation. Indeed, the results are best in children and become less favourable with each advancing decade.

The success of HSCT as curative therapy for patients with malignancy is limited, in part by transplantrelated  morbidity  and  mortality.  However,  the  main  cause  of  treatment  failure  is  disease  relapse, owing to the inability of conditioning regimens to eradicate malignancy.

## Conditioning regimens

Conditioning regimens used for HSCT must accomplish two goals, depending on the patient's disease and  the  source  of  progenitor  cells.  Since  the  majority  of  autologous  and  allogeneic  HSCT  are performed for the treatment of malignant disease, the regimen must provide tumour cytoreduction and, ideally,  disease  eradication.  In  the  case  of  allogeneic  HSCT,  the  regimen  must  be  sufficiently immunosuppressive to overcome graft rejection of the donor stem cells.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Early conditioning regimens were based on total body irradiation (TBI), where high doses of radiation were required to provide adequate immunosuppression. However, in an effort to decrease the toxicity of  the  regimen,  modified  TBI-based  conditioning  regimens  were  introduced  where  a  reduced  or fractionated dose of TBI was administered in combination with cyclophosphamide as immunosuppressant (and in some cases the addition of other cytotoxic agents). TBI disadvantages and the high technical requirements of the irradiation prompted consideration for effective regimens based on chemotherapy alone.

Over the past two decades, the combination of high dose oral busulfan (1 mg/kg every 6 hours x 16 doses, over 4 days) with cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg), so-called \"Bu/Cy2\", or with cyclophosphamide  (200  mg/kg),  so-called  \"-Bu/Cy4\"  with/without  other  chemotherapeutic  agents and/or radiotherapy has been extensively used as a preparative regimen for malignant haematological diseases,  non  malignant  diseases,  as  well  as  genetic  diseases,  childhood  metabolic  disorders  and paediatric solid tumours. In both autologous and allogeneic transplantation, the Bu/Cy regimen is the most  commonly  used  non-TBI-based  pre-transplant  conditioning  treatment.  In  this  preparative regimen,  the  primary  purpose  of  busulfan  is  to  eradicate  malignant  cells  (myeloablation)  and  for cyclophosphamide is to induce immunosuppression in the recipient so that rejection is prevented and engraftment of the donor haematopoietic system is permitted.

At  present,  although  a  number  of  different  agents  have  been  used  for  their  antitumor  effects  in haematological  malignancies,  in  general,  they  can  be  divided  into  two  categories:  TBI-based  and chemotherapy-based.  The  decision  guiding  which  preparative  regimen  to  use  is  often  based  on  the predicted  tumour-specific  activity  of  that  regimen,  its  potential  toxicity,  or  the  availability  of  the radiotherapy facilities. In general, radiation- and chemotherapy-based regimens are associated with a similar probability of achieving long-term disease free survival. A  regimen  with  busulfan  (16  mg/kg)  and  melphalan  (140  mg/m2)  followed  by  autologous  or allogeneic HSCT demonstrated efficacy in patients with myeloid malignancies and multiple myeloma. In  patients  with  thalassemia,  busulfan  at  14  mg/kg  and  cyclophosphamide  at  120-200  mg/kg  was  a well-tolerated and effective regimen for allografting. A conditioning regimen including busulfan (12 mg/kg),  melphalan  (100  mg/m 2 )  and  thiotepa  (500  mg/m2)  following  by  autologous  HSCT  have shown  good  results  in  a  variety  of  haematological  malignancies  and  solid  tumours.  Regimens involving busulfan, cyclophosphamide and thiotepa or etoposide has been utilised prior to autografting and allografting. Transplant procedure The  conditioning  regimen  is  given  during  the  days  before  transplant.  The  precise  duration  and sequence of administration depends on the specific conditioning regimen. Severe prolonged myelosuppression follows the intensive conditioning regimen with declining in peripheral blood cell counts that require platelet and red blood cells transfusion support and special measures to avoid lethal infections. Two to five weeks after the transplant, the engraftment of donated cells becomes apparent by the appearance of normal white cells, platelets and reticulocytes in the blood. Engrafment is usually defined as the number of days from transplant to reach &gt;500 neutrophils/ µ L and &gt;20.000 platelets/ µ L without transfusion support. However, it takes 6 to 12 months (or somewhat longer) to recover the immune cell function. Toxicity of the high-dose chemo-radiotherapy may also affect other organs or tissues such as the gastrointestinal, lung or liver, causing life-threatening problems. Graft  rejection  (immune  destruction  of  the  graft  by  host  residual  cells)  or  graft  failure  due  to insufficient-abnormal stem cells in the graft or anomalies in the microenvironment is an infrequent but serious complication. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Graft versus host  disease  (GVHD)  results  when  the  donor's  immune  cells,  especially  the  T lymphocytes,  sense  that  the  host  cells  are  different  from  themselves  and,  attack  them  if  they  find significant variations. GVHD is manifested primarily by symptoms and signs associated with the skin, gastrointestinal system and liver. This immune reaction also has the potential to recognise and attack the  malignant  cells  of  the  recipient  (GVT)  and  has  been  associated  with  a  less  likely  disease recurrence. GVHD can be divided into two somewhat distinct clinical entities: acute GVHD occurring in  the  first  90-100  days  after  transplantation,  and  chronic  GVHD  developing  after  the  third  month post-transplant. GVHD may be life threatening in the severe forms of the disease. Patients undergoing allogeneic progenitor cell transplantation typically receive prophylactic treatment for acute GVHD.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Most  patients  undergoing  transplantation  require  blood  cell  replacement,  nutritional  support  and treatment  for  GVHD.  The  conditioning  treatment  prior  to  transplant  can  impair  any  system  that  is dependent  on  replacement  by  stem  cells.  The  immunosuppression  also  leads  to  a  very  high  risk  of infections by bacteria, fungi, viruses or other parasites.

Peripheral  blood  mobilised  stem  cells  determines  a  more  rapid  engrafment  as  compared  to  bone marrow stem cells. Haematopoietic growth factor such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) can be used after transplant to stimulate the production of neutrophils and shorten the period of neutropenia.

## Busulfan

- -To reduce the high hepatic concentration of busulfan resulting from hepatic first pass through the liver, which is suspected to be involved in the risk of hepatic VOD.

Busulfan  is  an  alkylating  agent  with  myeloablative  properties  and  activity  against  non-dividing marrow  cells  and,  possibly,  non-dividing  malignant  cells.  Its  use  has  been  well  established  in  the treatment of haematological malignancies, particularly in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia and other  myeloproliferative  syndromes.  High-dose  oral  busulfan  is  also  used  in  combination  with cyclophosphamide as preparative (conditioning) regimens for haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation. Oral busulfan at high dose of 1 mg/kg every 6 hours over 4 days has been authorised and marketed in France, in Austria, and in Spain. Nowadays,  only  an  oral  form  of  busulfan  (2  mg  tablets)  is  marketed  in  the  European  Union.  It  is currently licensed since more than ten years in twelve European countries for the palliative treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia. The use of oral busulfan, administered at high doses ( i.e., 1 mg/kg x 16 doses,  administered  over  4  days)  for  the  preparative  treatment  before  HSCT  is  current  practice  in Europe and elsewhere, although this particular indication has been authorised only in some Member States. Busulfan-based conditioning therapy produces high anti-tumour efficacy. However, these high doses (up to 280 mg/day) currently require patients to swallow large numbers of tablets (30 tablets every 6 hours, 120 tablets a day). This method of drug delivery is unpredictable as it is often compromised by vomiting, variation of dietary intake, concurrent drugs and inherent biological variability in intestinal absorption  among  patients.  Also,  oral  busulfan  is  poorly  water-soluble  leading  to  unpredictable systemic exposure  (Grochow  1993;  Hassan,  Ehrsson  et  al. 1996). The  steady-state busulfan concentration has been correlated with graft rejection and disease relapse. Some studies also suggest a direct relationship between the severity of conditioning regimen toxicities, especially veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver, and high plasma levels of busulfan (Grochow, Jones et al. 1989; Slattery, Sanders et al. 1995; Dix, Wingard et al. 1996). Rationale for intravenous high dose busulfan It  is  recognised  that  as  a  result  of  these  factors,  the  oral  administration  of  high-dose  busulfan  is associated  with  an  inherent  safety  problem  both  from  the  risk  for  lethal  toxicities  from  inadvertent overdosing and the potential for recurrent or persistent malignancy after transplantation as a result of under dosing. Consequently, the main benefits expected from an i.v. form are: -To provide a well-controlled dose to the patient, avoiding problems of compliance with the oral form due to, e.g., vomiting. -To reduce inter-individual variability on blood exposure by administering a 100% bioavailable dose to every patient at every administration. A lower inter-patient variability would result in a less frequent over- or under-exposure. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -To offer a more comfortable way of administering to patients having difficulties in swallowing numerous pills, such as elderly people or children (500 to 600 pills for an adult over 4 days), or to those with anticipatory nausea.

The scope of the current application involves a pharmaceutical form of busulfan for intravenous use, exclusively  for  high-dose  conditioning  treatment.  Concerning  the  traditional  low-dose  indication(s), such  as  treatment  of  chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  and  other  myeloproliferative  disorders,  these  are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

outside the scope of the current application, and a positive benefit-risk ratio is not claimed in these conditions.

## 2. Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

## Composition

The product consists of the active substance; busulfan dissolved in a vehicle of polyethylene glycol 400 (macrogol 400) and dimethylacetamide in a ratio of 2:1. It appears as a clear solution in a 10ml, single  use,  glass  ampoule.  It  is  presented  as  a  concentrate  (6mg  /  ml)  which  should  be  diluted  to approx. 0.5mg/ml prior to use as stated in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC).

Some solubilising compositions were evaluated, and different busulfan concentrations in solution were achieved. Taking into account the high solubility of busulfan in DMA and since PEG 400 appeared to be a physiologically acceptable co-solvent; various ratios of both were evaluated to obtain the desired 6-mg/ml potency. Keeping in mind the need to avoid the leaching from a rubber stopper, an ampoule made of type I glass was chosen as the primary packaging. The chemical resistance to interactions with the components of glass containers was also an important consideration.

Active substance Busulfan INN PhEur is 1,4-di(methylsulfonoxy)butane, an established pharmacopoeial substance. It  is  a  white  crystalline  solid  synthesised  from  the  addition  of  methanesulfonyl  chloride  to  1,4butanediol in triethylamine and THF. The crude product is purified by recrystallisation from acetone and  water.  The  simple  structure  of  busulfan  has  been  confirmed  by  spectroscopic  evidence;  it  is achiral. Solid-state properties of the active substance are not relevant as the final product is a solution. Specification of the active substance The specification is in line with the PhEur specification and includes tests for identity, assay (high performance liquid chromatography - HPLC and potentiometric titration), and related substances by HPLC,  water  content  and  residual  solvents  etc.,  as  well  as  microbial  contamination.  Analytical methodology has been validated and the results of recent batch analyses (n=12) indicate satisfactory uniformity and compliance with specification. Stability of the active substance Four  batches  of  drug  substance  were  included  in  stability  studies  following  the  CPMP  stability guideline. All controls carried out in these studies were stability demonstrating. From the  results  presented,  a  3-year  re-test  period  could  be  authorised  without  any  special  storage conditions. Other ingredients The other ingredients are Macrogol 400 PhEur and dimethylacetamide controlled to the pharmeuropa monograph. It was concluded that the aforementioned materials are of satisfactory quality and pose no concern of risk in the context of TSE. Product development and finished product The  objective  of  the  formulation  work  was  to  develop  a  busulfan  dosage  suitable  for  intravenous infusion. A potency of 6 mg/ml was desired for the parenteral formulation. Due to the poor aqueous solubility  of  busulfan,  (0.1  mg/ml)  a  non-aqueous  system  was  necessary  to  prepare  a  concentrate. Also,  as  the  main  mechanism  of  busulfan  degradation  was  hydrolysis,  aqueous  compositions  were rejected. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The labelled volume is 10.0 ml. although overfilling was necessary to compensate for the viscosity of the liquid and to make possible the total extraction of the volume.

Concerning  development  of  the  manufacturing  process,  busulfan  is  known  to  be  sensitive  to  heat, therefore  heat  sterilisation  was  discounted  in  favour  of  sterilisation  by  filtration  (0.2  micron hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride membrane). The process was qualified in terms of:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Filter integrity test
-  a bacterial retention study performed with various values of filtration parameters such as flow rates and differential pressures which simulate a worst-case-scenario.
-  a quantitative estimation and qualitative characterisation of materials that are extracted from the sterilising filters by the product, and their biological effects.

Added  sterility  assurance  is  given  by  the  fact  that,  due  to  the  nature  of  busulfan  and  the  vehicle, microorganisms do not proliferate in the drug product, which in fact has a biocidal effect, even against A. niger .

The  manufacturing  process  is  straightforward  with  mixing,  filter  sterilisation  and  filling  under nitrogen. Product Specification The  release  specification  for  the  product  includes  relevant  tests  and  acceptance  criteria  for  assay, degradation  products,  water,  endotoxins,  sterility,  etc.  Batch  analytical  results  indicate  satisfactory compliance with the agreed specification. Stability of the Product The results of forced degradation studies (excessive heat, light and oxidative stress) indicate that the product  is  not  sensitive  to  light,  peroxide  or  oxygen;  no  change  in  colour  and  no  degradation  was observed. In acidic, basic and heat conditions, the product is sensitive to hydrolysis and the stability is directly dependent on solution moisture levels. Stability results deciding the shelflife were derived from 4 production batches stored under ICH and temperature-cycling conditions for up to two years. Since the product is intended to be stored in the refrigerator  these  were:  accelerated  (25ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  long  term  (refrigerated,  2  -  8ºC).  As expected, the decrease in busulfan assay in accelerated conditions was very pronounced, &gt; 10% loss after  6  months,  correlating  with  a  pronounced  increase  of  degradation  products.  In  long-term conditions (2 - 8 ºC) a better stability profile has been observed. Appearance, colour of the solution and water content do not change, and particulate matter results are acceptable. An appropriate shelf-life specification was defined, which is larger than the release specification for assay and impurities. At certain stability time points the particulate matter has also been verified. In summary the results support the product shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC. Stability during use, after dilution The stability of busulfan has been examined after dilution of the product in 5% dextrose and in 0.9 % sodium chloride for injection (saline), Busulfan was found stable after dilution at the required final concentration (0.5 mg/ml), in PVC perfusion bag, not protected from light, for:  8 hours after dilution in 5% dextrose or 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) for injection, stored at 20°C ± 5°C  12 hours after dilution in 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) for injection stored at 2°C-8°C followed by 3 hours stored at 20° C ± 5°C From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately after dilution. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than the above-mentioned conditions when dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Concerning  the  loss  of  busulfan  by  interaction  with  plastic  infusion  materials,  busulfan  solutions prepared at 0.1 mg/ml in both infusion media showed that there is no significant loss when the product is  stored  in  PVC  bags  for  up  8  hours  at  room  temperature  or  when  passed  through  an  i.v. administration set.

A study of extractables has been conducted to determinate the compatibility of busulfan diluted and undiluted  with  PVC  bag/tubing/polypropylene  syringe  and  syringe  filters  after  12  hours  storage  at 25ºC. Extractables detectable by UV were not observed in the samples.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The purity of busulfan active substance, and the control of the manufacturing process and specification for  the  finished  product  indicate  reliable  in  vitro  reproducibility  of  this  medicinal  product.  The filtration  sterilisation  process  has  been  well  validated  and  the  intrinsic  biocidal  properties  of  the composition indicate no concerns relating to microbiological safety. Stability of the product has also been shown to be satisfactory. Furthermore, when diluted in accordance with directions in the SPC the in-use stability has been investigated and found to be maintained for several hours.

In general, the information provided in the Quality dossier suggests this is a product that should have satisfactory and uniform quality characteristics from batch to batch.

Studies  of  busulfan  resistant  strains  of  cultured  tumour  cells  support  the  idea  that  the  DNA  crosslinkage  is  a  primary  toxic  action  of  busulfan.  Resistant  cells  can  eliminate  the  DNA  cross-linkage produced by the drug within six hours after a busulfan exposure. In contrast, DNA cross-linkages were unchanged in similarly treated cultures of  non-resistant,  busulfan  sensitive  cells,  even  after  twentyfour hours (Vendrik, Bergers et al. 1992). Busulfan enters cells by passive diffusion, so an alteration of transport is not involved as a mechanism of drug resistance (Fox, Boyle et al. 1991). In vitro studies of  cultured  marrow  cells  indicate  that  the  lower  range  of  cytotoxic  concentrations  of  busulfan  is relatively selective for granulocytes as compared to cells giving rise to other blood elements, such as platelets  and  lymphocytes  (Buggia,  Locatelli  et  al.  1994).  As  the  dose  of  busulfan  is  increased, cultured  cells  from  all  three  haematopoietic  cell  lines  are  affected  (Black  and  Livingston  1990; Buggia, Locatelli et al. 1994).

At the time of the opinion, there were a number of unresolved minor pharmaceutical issues having no impact on the benefit/risk balance of the product. The applicant committed to resolve these by means of post-opinion Follow Up Measures within an agreed timeframe. 3. Toxico-pharmacological aspects The dossier includes  a  literature  review  of  the  non-clinical  aspects  of  busulfan,  and  the  vehicle  for injection  N,  N-dimethylacetamide  (DMA) and polyethylene  glycol  400.  The  applicant  according  to GLP undertook additional non-clinical toxicology studies of the new formulation for intravenous use. Pharmacodynamics The primary molecular action of busulfan is alkylation of intracellular nucleophiles. Both proteins and nucleic acids are affected. With regard to DNA, busulfan reacts with guanine residues to form a fourcarbon  di-guanine  DNA  cross-linkage  with  release  of  methylsulfonate  (Tong  and  Ludlum  1980; Douglas 1984; Buggia, Locatelli et al. 1994). The DNA cross-linkage causes misreading of the DNA code and single-strand breakage. The degree of DNA cross-linkage has been shown to be proportional to  the  dose  and  cytotoxicity  of  the  compound  (Chaney  and  Sancar  1996).  Busulfan-induced  crosslinkages  of  DNA  to  nuclear  proteins  may  also  occur  and  is  considered  a  cytotoxic  mechanism (Buggia,  Locatelli  et  al.  1994).  Busulfan  has  also  been  reported  to  esterify  phosphate  groups  of chromosomal DNA, accounting for the fragmentation of chromosomes seen in various cell types after treatment  (Buggia,  Locatelli  et  al.  1994).  Chromosomal  damage  further  contributes  to  the  overall cytotoxic effect. Studies  of  cloned  tumour  and  normal  cells  indicate  that  busulfan  interrupts  certain  parts  of  the  cell mitotic  cycle.  While  busulfan  can  act  on  cells  at  any  stage  of  mitosis,  similar  to  other  alkylating agents, in  vitro studies  with  tumour  cell  lines  indicate  that  replicating  cells  are  most  sensitive  to busulfan in the late G1 phase and that progression through the cell cycle is blocked in the G2 phase. Cultured cells in the S-phase, which involves DNA synthesis, are not as affected because the DNA repair systems are active at this stage (Buggia, Locatelli et al. 1994). Clinically, busulfan is cytotoxic to proliferating tissues, especially granulopoietic cells in the bone marrow. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The selectivity of busulfan for granulocytes has been related to differences in the cellular permeability of granulocytes to busulfan relative to other cells (Buggia, Locatelli et al. 1994). Alternatively, other authors suggest that the relative susceptibility of haematopoietic stem cells to busulfan is because they

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

remain in the G1 phase of the cell mitotic cycle longer than the cells that spend significant time in the S-phase  (Dunn  1974;  Bishop  and  Wassom  1986).  This  latter  explanation  fits  with  the  effects  of busulfan  on  other  tissues,  such  as  reproductive  stem  cells  or  the  ocular  lenticular  cells,  which  also spend a relatively extended time in the G1 phase of the cell mitotic cycle. The susceptibility of these cells  to  busulfan  supports  the  view  that  busulfan  is  cytotoxic  to  slowly  proliferating  stem  cell compartments (Dunn 1974; Bishop and Wassom 1986).

## · In vivo studies

The acute effects of busulfan involve the reduction of the number of haematopoietic precursor or stem cells found in bone marrow. Oral doses of 29 to 80 mg/kg have, in the mouse, been shown to produce an  acute  10%  cell  loss  [D 10 ]  sixteen  to  twenty-four  hours  after  treatment.  The  slower  reproducing haematopoietic stem cells (identified as spleen colony forming units in assays) were reduced following acute exposure to busulfan. The more differentiated precursor cells developing into granulocytes and erythrocytes were reduced to a lesser extent (Dunn 1974). In addition to reducing the number of stem cells, there is evidence that a proportion of those stem cells surviving acute busulfan exposure have an altered capacity to produce differentiated progeny as a result of genetic damage (Dunn 1974). Longerterm studies suggest that busulfan induces a defect in the ability of haematopoietic cells to replicate and differentiate in the bone marrow. Eighty percent of the mice treated orally with busulfan doses of 20 mg/kg eventually experienced complete marrow loss accompanied by aplastic anaemia and death when the group was followed for 240 days post-exposure. The marrow failure was associated with a marked reduction ( i.e ., less than 1% of pre-treatment values) in the numbers of both spleen and agar colony forming marrow progenitor cells (Morley and Blake 1974). The biological effect of busulfan has been studied in the rat by Dunn (Dunn and Elson 1970; Dunn 1973).  In  the  rat,  single  doses  of  busulfan  are  reported  to  produce  a  delayed  decrease  in  mature haemopoietic  cells  that  can  not  be  explained  by  a  delayed  absorption  of  busulfan.  Further  studies (Dunn and Elson 1970; Dunn 1973; Dunn 1974) have indicated that busulfan has a relatively selective effect  on spleen colony forming units (CFU), initially sparing the mature haemopoietic cells, which decline later in time. In one such study (Dunn 1974), a single 10 mg/kg i.p. dose of busulfan in rats produced a maximal 90% decline in the survival of CFU by 2 days after injection, followed by a slow steady recovery of normal levels over the ensuing 3 weeks. Increasing the dose of busulfan beyond 10mg/kg i.p. was reported to cause no further effect, in spite of the fact that radiation or other cytoxic drugs were able to kill additional CFU. This phenomenon has led to the postulation CFU may exhibit a  cell  cycle  phase  resistance  to  the  toxic  actions  of  busulfan,  especially  during  the  DNA-synthetic period  (S  period)  of  the  cell  cycle.  Additional  studies  have  supported  the  view  that  busulfan  is differentially  toxic  to  CFU  in  the  G 1 or  G 0 state  of  the  cell  cycle  (Dunn  1974).  In  conclusion,  it appears that busulfan inhibits bone marrow stem cells. In dogs, busulfan is profoundly myelotoxic (Phadungpojna, Andersson et al. 1996). Four consecutive i.v.  daily  doses  of  4  mg/kg/day  over  a  two-hour  infusion  every  six-hours  produced  bone  marrow depletion in the rib  and  femur by day five  after  the  first  day  of  treatment.  Lower  doses  resulted  in decreased platelet and white cell counts on day five. Historically, high repeated oral doses of busulfan (doses not given) have been used in dogs as preparation for grafting bone marrow from MHC identical litter mates (Storb, Weiden et al. 1976). Deeg and coauthors carried out a more recent dose escalation study in a canine model with a intravenous busulfan preparation (Deeg, Schuler et al. 1999). The goal was to determine a marrow-ablative dose and to test the ability of autologous marrow to reconstitute hematopoiesis in dogs so treated. Marrow ablation was achieved at 20 mg/kg given either as a single dose  or  in  four  daily  increments  of  5  mg/kg  each.  Four  dogs  were  given  busulfan  at  20-mg/kg followed  30  hours  later  by  infusion  of  autologous  marrow,  and  all  showed  prompt  and  complete hematopoietic reconstitution.

## · General and safety pharmacology programme

Few general acute pharmacological effects of busulfan are reported in the literature. Doses of busulfan in  the  myelotoxic  range  produce  emesis and  myoclonic  seizures in animals and  man,  but treatment with anticonvulsant drugs successfully prevents the seizures and droperidol and other antiemetics have been useful in treating emesis.

## Neuropharmacology

As a small lipophilic molecule busulfan has been determined to easily cross the blood brain barrier. High  doses of busulfan have  been  reported to cause acute convulsions and death in  mice (Fitzsimmons, Ghalie et al. 1990). Seizures, and the resulting death of the animal, are prevented by pretreatment  with  either  phenytoin  (i.p)  or  phenobarbital  (i.p)  (Fitzsimmons,  Ghalie  et  al.  1990). Valproic acid was not effective in preventing the convulsions or death produced by busulfan in mice.

Busulfan doses of 100 mg/m 2 , 150mg/m 2 , or 200mg/m 2 i.v. on two consecutive days resulted in a 37% incidence of emesis in Rhesus monkeys (Dix, Bucur et al. 1995). In man, the lower doses of busulfan used in cancer chemotherapy are virtually devoid of gastrointestinal activity while the higher cytotoxic doses  of  oral  busulfan  used  in  transplant  programs  cause  nausea,  vomiting  and  stomatitis,  liver function abnormalities and hepatic VOD (Buggia, Locatelli et al. 1994). Hepatic VOD is a recognized complication of conditioning therapy prior to transplant. Dogs appear to be somewhat more sensitive to myelotoxicity of busulfan than humans (Epstein, Min et al. 1992). VOD is the most serious liver toxicity observed after high-dose busulfan-containing regimens (Vassal 1994). In man, high oral doses of  busulfan  (1  mg/kg)  administered  every  six  hour  for  four  days  have  been  reported  to  deposit busulfan crystals in liver  cells  (Buggia,  Locatelli  et  al.  1994)  which  has  resulted  in  non-thrombotic obstruction  of  intrahepatic  veins  (Vassal  1994).  The  pathophysiology  of  VOD  is  multifactorial involving  cytotoxic,  immunologic,  inflammatory  and  hemostatic  events  that  are  not  mutually exclusive.

Cardiovascular Acute  i.v.  administration  of  myelotoxic  doses  of  busulfan  has  been  reported  to  cause  flushing  in Rhesus macaques but no other acute cardiovascular events are mentioned (Dix, Bucur et al. 1995). In man, treatment with high myeloablative doses of busulfan (14 mg/kg orally) and cyclophosphamide during conditioning for bone-marrow transplant was reported to cause sudden cardiac tamponade in 2%  of  thalasseamic  patients  (Angelucci,  Mariotti  et  al.  1992).  This  effect  was  caused  by  the accumulation of a massive volume of clear fluid in the pericardial cavity. It appears to be related to systemic iron overload and haemochromatosis rather than cardiac dilation, microthrombi, focal artery wall  necrosis,  or  myocardial  cell  necrosis  (Angelucci,  Mariotti  et  al.  1992).  Reports  of  cardiac tamponade, or similar actions in animals were not found in the literature. Also, there were no reports of acute changes in cardiovascular function after busulfan treatment Respiratory In  man,  use  of  busulfan  for  bone  marrow  transplantation  has  caused  subclinical  histopathological changes in both pulmonary epithelial cells (Israel-Biet, Labrune et al. 1991) and proliferating type II alveolar cells (Hook and DiAugustine 1976; Pietra 1991). These changes were dose-related (Comis 1985). The nuclear constituents of the affected cells were characterised by large, bizarre hyperchromatic  nuclei  that  contained  coarse  chromatic  granules.  Such  cells  are  found  not  only  in tissue, but also in sputa and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serve as a reliable marker of the degree of drug toxicity. Large numbers of those cells can signal impending pulmonary fibrosis (Pietra 1991). Fibrotic changes in lung tissue after busulfan administration begin with accumulation of cellular debris from  dead  and  dying  alveolar  cells.  The  cellular  debris  becomes  infiltrated  with  fibroblasts  and organised  with  the  placement  of  mature  fibrotic  tissue.  Eventually,  large  fibrous  areas  occur  in  the lung, giving rise to «busulfan lung» (Littler, Kay et al. 1969; Filipek 1979). Gastrointestinal Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Spermatogenesis

Busulfan blocks spermatogenesis in rats and other species by acting on early spermatogonia and germ cells  to  prevent  mitosis;  this  may  ultimately  result  in  sterility  (Dunn  1974).  When  given  prior  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

puberty,  doses  of  10  mg/kg  or  higher  produce  sterility,  destruction  of  seminiferous  epithelium  and abnormal gonadal development and maturation (Dunn 1974; Bishop and Wassom 1986). Single oral doses  of  busulfan  as  low  as  10  mg/kg  can  cause  infertility  in  male  rats  by  killing  type  A1 spermatogonia. Higher doses (20 to 60 mg/kg) or longer exposure to lower doses (2 mg/kg i.p. at twoweek intervals over 150 days) killed all A1 spermatagonia (Bishop and Wassom 1986).

## Immunoreactivity

Studies in mice have indicated that busulfan depresses the immune system (Dunn 1974; Bishop and Wassom 1986).

## Ocular

Busulfan treatment has been reported to produce lenticular changes and cataracts in both animals and man (Grimes  and  Von  Sallmann  1966;  Dunn  1974;  Vizel  and  Oster  1982;  Fraunfelder  and  Meyer 1983) corneal thinning has been reported after bone marrow transplantation proceeded by high-dose oral busulfan treatment. Pharmacokinetics Absorption For the proposed intravenous route of administration of Busilvex immediate and full absorption into the systemic circulation is expected. The  pharmacokinetics  of  i.v.  busulfan  has  been  explored  in  rats  and  dogs  in  comparison  to  oral busulfan. For both routes of administration, AUC-dose proportional increase was observed. The  pharmacokinetics  of  busulfan  following  single  intravenous  administration  was  linear  over  the dose  range  administered  and  less  variable  than  following  oral  administration  to  rats.  The  drug  was eliminated  from  plasma,  following  intravenous  and  oral  dosing,  in  a  first-order  fashion  with  mean elimination  half-lives  of  2.2  and  2.0  h,  respectively.  The  pharmacokinetics  parameters  were  less variable with the i.v. formulation than for the oral tablet. The route of administration did not affect half-life, clearance and volume of distribution. Distribution Distribution data in mice and in rat were supported by literature on i.v. busulfan (Bishop and Wassom 1986). Additional data on distribution in monkey were presented It  has  been  demonstrated that whilst busulfan is cleared rapidly from the blood of mice and rabbits following i.v. injection, with only 10% of the administered dose being present after 5 or 10 minutes (Bishop and Wassom 1986) a low level of drug remains in the plasma for 24 to 48 hours. Rapid  tissue  distribution  was  confirmed  in  a  study  using  monkeys  (Hassan,  Oberg  et  al.  1992) Busulfan was labelled in the alkylating portion of the molecule (111 C). The authors administered i.v. 11 C-busulfan  and  determined  the  distribution  of  the  radioactivity  by  positron  emission  tomography. The  liver  was  found  to  accumulate  increasing  amounts  of  busulfan  throughout  a  45-minute observation period. In addition, significant drug levels were measured in the lungs and brain. In all three organs, distribution occurred within minutes. The radioactivity accumulated in the liver was 9fold higher that in the brain at the end of the experiment. The compound showed also a tendency to accumulate in the lungs with time. Nevertheless, the peak of radioactivity reached in the brain within 2-4 min subsequently declined (approximately 50%). No data is available on the distribution in other tissues. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Comparison of the distribution of busulfan was studied in rats following single and multiple dosing by intravenous  and  oral  routes  of  administration  (0.6-0.75mg/kg).  Six  major  organs  were  harvested  at each of four time points from 5 to 360 minutes post-dose and busulfan levels quantified using HPLC assay. The levels peaked 5 minutes after i.v. single or multiple dose with a descending order of heart 0.829 µ g/g)&gt;  brain  &gt;  lung  &gt;  kidney  =  liver  &gt;  spleen  (0.316 µ g/g).  The  levels  were  found  to  have declined  significantly  after  6  hours  and  that  after  16  doses  there  was  no  apparent  accumulation (Phadungpojna, Gong et al. 1996)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In another distribution study, 14 C-labelled busulfan was administered i.p. at a dose of 15 mg/kg to rats (Hassan, Ehrsson et al. 1988).  Plasma and brain tissue samples were collected for up to 24 hours. Concentration curves for brain and plasma were found to be remarkably similar and confirmed rapid tissue distribution. These curves remained parallel throughout an eight-hour collection time; the levels in the brain were only slightly lower than those in the plasma. The elimination half-lives in plasma and brain were also similar and calculated to be approximately three hours for intact busulfan and 8 hours for  total 14 C-radioactivity.  Plasma  protein  binding  was  low,  9.2  ±  4.4%.  Plasma  and  brain  samples collected  revealed  at  least  three  metabolites:  3-hydroxysulfolane,  tetrahydrothiophene-1-oxide,  and sulfolane.

Studies  in  murine  models  suggest  that  an  inducible  enzyme  system  such  as  cytochrome  P450  or glutathione S-transferases plays an important role in the metabolic conversion of busulfan. Concomitant administration of enzyme inducing anticonvulsants such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, or inhibiting, may affect the myeloablative efficiency of high-dose busulfan.

Metabolism Data on metabolism were provided from literature review. Relevant information was available on the metabolism pathway of busulfan in rat and from a cytotoxicity study on the metabolites (Hassan and Ehrsson 1987) after oral administration. [ 14 C] busulfan was administered i.p.(15 mg/kg) to 5 male Sprague-Dawley rats (Hassan and Ehrsson 1987). For 72 hours, the urinary recovery of 14 C was approximately 70% of the total dose, while the fecal excretion was within the range 1.5-2%. The pattern of the urinary metabolites of busulfan was studied  by  HPLC  in  combination  with  radioactivity  detection  of  the  pooled  urine.  At  least  eight radioactive fractions could be separated. Three major metabolite peaks were identified by GC/MS and NMR  spectroscopy:  3-hydroxysulfolane  (39%  of  total  urine  radioactivity),  tetrahydrothiophene  1oxide (20%), and sulfolane (13%). Busulfan (6%) and tetrahydrofuran (2%) were also identified. A sulfonium  ion  glutathione  conjugate  was  hypothesised  as  another  metabolite,  but  was  not  isolated because it was very unstable. However, another compound was observed. This metabolite co-eluted with  the  sulfonium  ion  obtained  of  the  reaction  of  busulfan  with  N-acetyl-L-cysteine  and  produced tetrahydrothiophene when hydrolyzed. Finally, busulfan and the three main metabolites were tested for  cytotoxicity on Chinese V79 hamster cells in vitro. Cell toxicity was induced only by busulfan, which indicates that the cytotoxicity in vivo is mediated by the parent compound, as expected. In  another  experiment,  the  liver  was  perfused  and  the  common  bile  duct  cannulated  (Hassan  and Ehrsson  1987).  Busulfan  was  added  to  the  perfusate  and  bile  was  collected  for  four  hours.  HPLC analyses  of  the  bile  indicated  only  parent  compound  and  one  metabolite,  the  sulfonium  ion  of glutathione,  or γ -glutamylβ -(S-tetrahydrothiophenium)  alanyl-glycine.  When  GSH-transferase  was inhibited  by  the  addition  of  ethacrynic  acid,  the  amount  of  the  sulfonium  ion  excreted  in  the  bile significantly  decreased  and  the  amount  of  busulfan  excreted  increased  significantly.  These  data support the previous study in which the presence of the glutathione conjugate was only hypothesised. In a similar experiment, Marchand et al administered busulfan i.v. at a dose of 1 mg/kg via a jugular cannula to male rats and bile was collected for 8 hours (Marchand, Remmel et al. 1988). Peak biliary excretion  occurred  at  90  minutes  and  declined  thereafter,  but  an  increase  in  the  amount  of administered dose excreted in the bile was observed over the 8-hour time period. Twenty-six percent of the dose was the glutathione-sulfonium metabolite. Pharmacokinetic drug interactions As stated in the SPC, all patients should be premedicated with anticonvulsant drugs to prevent seizures reported with the use of Busilvex.  Phenytoin  and  phenobarbital  effectively  prevented  acute neurotoxicity in 60 and 68% of mice respectively (Fitzsimmons, Ghalie et al. 1990). Aroclor did not, and it is possible that this is due to the fact that only a single dose Aroclor was administered. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Toxicology

Most  of  the  toxicology  studies  in  the  application  were  based  on  the  literature  of  oral  busulfan. Busulfan  is  the  drug  of  preference  in  treatment  of  chronic  myelogenous  or  granulocytic  leukemia because  its  cytotoxic  activity  results  in  primary  damage  or  destruction  of  hematopoietic  cells.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Additional effects resulting from the cytotoxicity of busulfan in hematological and other tissues, as documented by both human and animal model studies, include lethality, sterility, teratogenicity, and alteration  of  immune  function.  Busulfan  has  been  shown  to  be  mutagenic  to  microorganisms, mammalian  cells  in  culture, Drosophila ,  and  rodents.  This  agent  is  also  considered  potentially carcinogenic  to  humans.  Various  tissue  hyperplasia  and  preneoplastic  cells  have  been  observed  in animal  model  studies  with  busulfan,  and  case  reports  on  human  patients  implicate  busulfan  as  the causative agent in induction of secondary malignancies (Bishop and Wassom 1986).

Busulfan  is  genotoxic  (Bishop  and  Wassom  1986)  and  it  is  classified  as  a  carcinogenic  agent  in humans (Group 1) according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC 1982).

The applicant has conducted a single dose toxicity study in rat, and a repeated dose toxicity studies in dogs (dose range-finding and definitive toxicity studies) following the recommended human schedule of administration to evaluate the safety of the finished product administered intravenously. Single dose toxicity study with busulfan injection formulation Acute  lethality  studies  of  busulfan  have  been  extensively  conducted  in  rats  and  mice  (Bishop  and Wassom 1986). The authors reported an LD50s ranging from 30 to 125 mg/kg for mice and from 14 to 25 mg/kg for rats. Delayed death due to the myelotoxic effects of busulfan is reported (Morley and Blake 1974) to result in LD50 values in mice between 15 and 30 mg/kg i.p. The applicant has conducted an acute intravenous toxicity study in rats to qualify impurities. Single doses of 1, 5, 10, 20 or 40 mg/kg of two lots of the busulfan formulation were administered, one lot representing a standard batch and one lot that underwent forced degradation. The degraded busulfan formulation was less toxic than the reference formulation, possibly due to a reduced quantity of active drug in this formulation. At the higher dose (40mg/kg) the early deaths were probably a consequence of acute CNS effects of DMA (DMA dose 2164mg/kg compared to published LD50 value for DMA by the intravenous route in rats of 2640mg/kg and the therapeutic human exposure of 166mg/kg/day) whereas  at  20mg/kg  (and  a  reduced  administered  dose  of  DMA)  the  typical  delayed  toxicity  of busulfan (exaggerated pharmacological response) was evident. Repeated dose toxicity study with busulfan injection formulation A dose range-finding  study  and  definitive  toxicity  study  were  conducted  in  male  and  female  dogs. Busulfan was administered as a two-hour infusion at a rate of 0.5 mL/kg/hr every 6 hours ( i.e. , q.i.d.) for four days followed by a saline flush. In the range-finding study, five i.v. dose groups (saline control, vehicle control DMA and PEG, 0.25, 1,  and  4  mg/kg)  and  one  oral  dose  group  (1  mg/kg)  were  used.  Blood  samples  were  collected  for toxicokinetic evaluation. Animals were monitored for 28-days post-dosing for clinical signs and other treatment-related effects. Two  high-dose  animals  have  been  euthanised in  extremis by  Day  7.  Bone  marrow  depletion, hepatocellular necrosis and a variety of lung lesions (indicative of sepsis) were believed to contribute to the deaths. Haematology effects such as decreased mean white blood cell counts were observed in the  surviving  animals  in  the  1-mg/kg  i.v.  and  oral  groups.  Decreased  mean  platelet  levels  were reported in all treatment groups. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  the  definitive  toxicity  study,  busulfan  was  administered  intravenously  to  four  dogs/sex/group  at doses of 0.25, 0.5, or 1 mg/kg as a two-hour infusion at a rate of 0.21 mL/kg/hour q.i.d. for four days followed by a saline flush. Saline and vehicle ( i.e. , DMA and PEG 400) control groups also received the  same infusion regimen. Following cessation of treatment, three dogs per group were sacrificed. The remaining one animal/sex/group was allowed to recover for 28 days

The toxic effects of administration on haematological parameters (decreases in white blood cells and platelet  counts)  observed  in  dogs  were  dose  related.  Myelotoxicity  is  the  sought  effect  of  the conditioning  regimen  with  busulfan. Hyperbilirubinemia,  alkaline  phosphatase  increase,  alanine aminotransferase  and  gamma  glutamyltransferase  elevations  observed  in  the  high  dose  group, suggesting liver damage. These altered enzyme levels returned to normal during the recovery period. Vehicle administration (at a concentration equivalent to the 1.0 mg/kg  q.i.d. group)  caused cytoplasmatic  vacuolation  and  fibrosis  in  liver.  This  hepatoxicity  is  consistent  with  the  toxicity  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

DMA described in the scientific literature these findings were also observed in the animals groups that received busulfan at the doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg.  The incidence was similar. The dose of DMA administered in the vehicle group and in the high dose intravenous group is inferior to the dose of DMA in  patients  at  the  recommended  posology  of  intravenous  busulfan  (on  a  mg/m 2 basis).  The applicant concluded that 0.25 mg/kg q.i.d. was the no-observable-effect-level (NOEL).

## Reproductive and developmental toxicity

Busulfan  produces  sterility,  as  determined  in  male  and  female  hamsters,  rats  and  mice  and  is teratogenic in mice, rats and rabbits (Bishop and Wassom 1986).

Local tolerance No specific study of local tolerance has been undertaken with busulfan injection. In the repeated dose toxicity  study  in  dog,  cellular  changes  in  the  vessels  at  the  sites  of  injection  were  observed.  The histopathological  data  for  the  injection  site  (the  site  immediately  surrounding  the  catheter  tip) suggested that reactions were related to the catheter and not to the vehicle or busulfan. The recovery data indicated that most changes were reversible. Studies on excipients and impurities SPF-NMRI  mice  (n  =  5/sex/group)  and  Sprague-Dawley  rats  (n  =  5/sex/group)  received  single intravenous, intraperitoneal or oral  doses of DMA and the lethal doses were determined. For  mice, LD50 values of 3.2, 3.4 and 4.9 ml/kg were reported following administration by the three respective routes. In rats, LD50 values of 2.8, 3 and 5.4 ml/kg were reported for intravenous, intraperitoneal and oral dosing, respectively (Bartsch, Sponer et al. 1976). Effects resulting from single DMA exposures have been summarized by Kennedy review (Kennedy 1986). Rats treated orally with 2.25 g DMA/kg or greater (lethal doses) exhibited pulmonary edema and congestion, hepatic necrosis and congestion, and renal tubule swelling. In other study in rats, an oral LD50 of 3.5 g/kg was described. Death occurred within 24 h due to respiratory failure. Autopsy revealed  generalized  haemorrhage  in  several  organs  with  degeneration  of  isolated  nerve  cells  and necrosis of the liver and kidney. Following intravenous injection in cats and dogs, 95 mg/kg produced no blood pressure effects, 236 mg/kg produced mild hypotension in both species and 472 mg/kg was lethal to cats. LD50 (i.v.) in both species was approximately 0.24 g/kg. Ocular instillation resulted in mild, but reversible corneal injury in rabbits. In  mice,  most  deaths  from  a  single  dose  of  DMA  (intravenous,  intraperitoneal,  or  oral)  occurred following  depression  and  coma  during  the  first  day  posttreatment  (Kim  1988).  Some  deaths  were delayed as long as 2 weeks. The pattern of mortality in rats was dose related. At the high dose levels the mortality in rats occurred between 5-10 min to 26 h, whereas at the lower lethal dose levels the mortality was protracted, occurring up to 11 days. Medicinal product no longer authorised

DMA is teratogenic in rats and may impair fertility. Repeated doses of DMA produce signs of liver toxicity, the first being increases in serum clinical enzymes followed by histopatological changes in the hepatocytes. Higher doses can produce hepatic necrosis and liver damage can be seen following single high exposures. The ICH Note for Guidance on Impurities: Residual Solvents (CPMP/ICH/283/95) classifies DMA as a level 2 solvent, the use of which should be limited due to its potentially significant toxicity. The limit for permitted daily exposure (PDE) is 10.9 mg/day. In the intravenous busulfan injection formulation, DMA will exceed this exposure level (166 mg/kg/day of DMA), resulting in a total daily dose of approximately 12.3g. This also corresponds to approximately 42%  of  the  maximun-tolerated  dose  on  a  mg/kg  basis,  as  established  in  a  phase  I  trial  in  man, exploring DMA as a potential anticancer agent (Weiss, Jackson et al. 1962). Reviews on the toxicity of  DMA  agree  upon  the  fact  that  the  main  target  organ  of  DMA  by  administration  of  single  or repeated  doses  in  dogs  is  the  liver.  The  dose-limiting  toxicities  of  DMA  in  the  phase  I  trial  were hepatic  toxicity  and  CNS  effects  (Weiss,  Jackson  et  al.  1962).  The  earliest  recognizable  signs, generally noted on the second or third day of treatment, were depression, lethargy, and occasionally confusion and disorientation. Lethargy and confusion became very severe in 5 patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Triethylamine

Triethylamine (a potential impurity that could be present in busulfan  drug  substance  when manufactured  by  the  commercial  process  proposed)  was  not  detected  using  a  gas  chromatographic method (the detection and the quantitation limits were determined respectively at 0.008% and 0.025% respectively).

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The Applicant has provided an estimate of the potential environmental exposure (PEC) in the aquatic compartment, assuming all unchanged drug is excreted in the urine, and there is no biodegradation, adsorption,  or  other  removal  of  the  product  from  waste.  Based  on  the  data  submitted,  no  adverse environmental effects are predicted from intravenous busulfan.

Busulfan is toxic in contact with skin, and if swallowed or inhaled. Overexposure to busulfan in the occupational setting may result in the same adverse effects which have been observed in experimental studies or when this substance is used medicinally. Acute exposure in sufficient dose may result in anaemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Therefore, procedures for proper handling and disposal of cytotoxic medicinal products should be followed.  Any unused product or waste should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements for cytotoxic drugs (see SPC, section 6.6). Discussion on toxico-pharmacological aspects The mechanism of action of busulfan is similar to that of other alkylating agents. It produces DNA cross-linking and chromosomal damage that can be lethal to rapidly dividing cells. At the low end of the active dose range, busulfan causes a selective depression of granulocytopoiesis. Increasing doses lead to progressive general myelotoxicity culminating in marrow ablation due to cell death. While intravenous administration circumvents problems associated with variable absorption after oral administration,  it  does  not  prevent  individual  variability  related  to  drug  elimination  and  other processes. Studies  in  murine  models  suggest  that  an  inducible  enzyme  system  such  as  cytochrome  P450  or glutathione S-transferases plays an important role in the metabolic conversion of busulfan. Therefore, concomitant administration of enzyme inducing or inhibiting substances may affect the myeloablative efficiency and modify the profile of toxicity (neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity) of busulfan. The  duration of Repeated  dose  intravenous toxicity study in Dog,  is considered too short. Nevertheless,  taking  into  account  the  clinical  studies  performed  with  intravenous  and  the  clinical experience  with  high  dose  oral  busulfan,  longer-term  repeated-dose  studies  are  not  considered necessary. The  CPMP  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Pre-clinical  evaluation  of  anticancer  medicinal  products (CPMP/SWP/997/96) would require that repeated dose studies in both rodent and non-rodent species are  conducted.  No  repeated  dose  toxicity  study  in  rodents  has  been  provided.  However,  it  is considered  that  the  extensive  reports  of  high-dose  oral  busulfan  toxicity  in  clinical  use  and  the repeated dose toxicity study in dogs provide adequate information.  Concerning the latter, one cannot eliminate the possibility that the hepatic toxicity findings are related to the excipient and a potential risk of liver toxicity in humans due to the DMA content in Busilvex. Busulfan  is  genotoxic.  With  regard  to  carcinogenicity,  the  human  data  are  sufficient  to  establish busulfan  as  a  human  carcinogen.  As  the  SPC  states  in  section  4.4,  the  increased  risk  of  a  second malignancy should be explained to the patients. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Busulfan  produces  sterility,  as  determined  in  male  and  female  hamsters,  rats  and  mice  and  is teratogenic in mice, rats and rabbits. In view of the preclinical information and the absence of data from adequate, well-controlled patient studies,  patients should be  made fully aware of the  potential hazards  to  reproduction  of  busulfan  injection.  Adequate  information  has  been  included  in  the  SPC (section  4.4)  and  package  leaflet  in  relation  to  infertility  and  teratogenicity.  Also,  busulfan  is contraindicated during pregnancy.

Overall,  the  main  toxicity  of  busulfan  is  neurotoxicity  and  damage  to  the  liver.  Thus,  the  risk  of hepatic toxicity due to DMA was of concern. However, based on the clinical data, i.v. busulfan did not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

appear  to  be  associated  with  additional  toxicity  compared  to  oral  busulfan.  Comparison  of  liver function  data  for  i.v.  busulfan  and  oral  busulfan  did  not  show  major  differences  between  the  two formulations (see Clinical Documentation). This is reflected in the SPC (section 4.8). It is not considered necessary to carry out additional local tolerance testing.

## 4. Clinical aspects

*The  overall clinical development program  for Busilvex  in adult patients consists of two pharmacokinetic  studies  (OMC-BUS-2  and  Amendment  4  to  OMC-BUS-3/OMC-BUS-4)  and  two phase II studies (OMC-BUS-3, OMC-BUS-4) (Table 1). Results from two supportive phase II studies in  adults  (OMC-BUS 6 and OMC-BUS 7) and one study in paediatric patients (OMC-BUS-5) also became available.

Table 1. Summary of clinical pharmacokinetics studies with Busilvex Rich data: complete pharmacokinetic profile (9 samples) LS: Limited sampling, pre-dosing (Cmin) and end of infusion (Cmax) Clinical pharmacology Pharmacodynamics Specific pharmacodynamic investigations with i.v. busulfan have not been submitted. The pharmacodynamic profile of busulfan is well known due to the experience with the oral formulation. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics have been investigated in 4 trials (Table 1). OMC BUS 2 was the first phase I trial performed with i.v. busulfan. \"Amendment 4 of OMC BUS 3&amp;4\" is a mainly pharmacokinetic substudy performed after conduct of OMC BUS 3 and 4. Two studies (OMC-BUS 2, and Amendment 4 to  OMC-BUS 3&amp;4) include an intra-patient  comparison  of the  pharmacokinetics  of  Busilvex  with oral busulfan. Pharmacokinetic  data  with  Busilvex  were  also  obtained  during  phase  II  efficacy  and  safety  trials (OMC-BUS 3 and OMC-BUS 4) as conditioning therapy prior to HSCT at the proposed dose and schedule  of  administration  (equivalent  to  oral  busulfan  standard  high-dose).  These  data  provided primarily population pharmacokinetics investigations of intra-patient variability and phase effects of the i.v. administration of busulfan.

## Absorption

Busilvex  as  a  liquid  formulation  for  intravenous  administration  has  a  bioavailability  of  100%. Busilvex was administered as a 2-hour infusion every 6 hours, mimicking the pharmacokinetic profile of the oral formulation where the absorption kinetics indicated a Tmax at about 2 hours (Hassan, Oberg et al. 1989; Hassan, Oberg et al. 1991).

From OMC-BUS 2 (see further), the dose-normalised ratio of i.v. AUC at first dose, v. oral AUC at steady-state was 90 ± 29% (3 patients). From amendment 4 of OMC-BUS 3&amp;4 (see further), the ratio of oral AUC at first dose, v. i.v. AUC at steady-state was 96 ± 12% (9 patients). Others have reported

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  bioavailability  of  oral  busulfan  to  be  in  the  range  of  70-80%,  75 ± 27%,  and  69%  (40  94%)(Hollis,  Marcellus  et  al.  1998;  Schuler,  Ehrsam  et  al.  1998;  Hassan,  Ljungman  et  al.  2001). Based on further historical data presented during the application (data not shown), mean (s.d.) oral and i.v. AUC at first dose was 1718 (868) and 1144 (313) in one series, and 1102 (411) and 1130 (312) µ Mol.min in a second series, respectively. At stead y state the corresponding values were 1252 (509) and 1183 (228), respectively.

The applicant selected  median bioavailability of 80% to develop Busilvex at a dose regimen of 0.8 mg/kg in order to be equivalent to the oral dose regimen at 1 mg/kg.

## Distribution

The mean volume of distribution (Vz) for i.v. busulfan ranged from 0.62 to 0.85 L/kg across the four studies (OMC-BUS 2, 3, 4 studies and amendment 4, see further). The reported volume of distribution of oral busulfan is 66% of body weight (Grochow, Jones et al. 1989), which was equivalent to that obtained with Busilvex. Busulfan  achieves  concentrations  in  the  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF)  approximately  equal  to  those  in plasma  (Hassan,  Oberg  et  al.  1989;  Vassal  1994).  The  substance  also  distributes  freely  into erythrocytes (Ehrsson and Hassan 1984). Reversible plasma protein binding is low, 7.4% ± 4.9%, over the range of 350 to 2750 ng/mL as determined by equilibrium dialysis at 25 ° C (Hassan, Oberg et al. 1989). Plasma concentrations in this range are achieved with a 1-mg/kg oral dose. Irreversible binding to  plasma elements, primarily albumin, has been estimated to be 32.4 ± 2.2% (Ehrsson and Hassan 1984). Metabolism Information  on  metabolism  was  obtained  from  literature  review  on  oral  busulfan.  The  metabolites identified  in  the  human  are  identical  to  those  identified  in  the  rat  (Hassan,  Oberg  et  al.  1989).  All metabolites  arise  from  the  initial  conjugation  of  busulfan  with  glutathione  in  a  glutathione S -transferase (GST) catalysed reaction. The most active human GST catalysing this reaction is GSTA1-1 (it is the major form of GST in the liver). Little work has been done on the identification of circulating metabolites in blood, although it is likely that the metabolites identified do circulate. A thiophenium ion, with an estimated half-life of 5 hours has been assayed in plasma (Gibbs, Murray et al. 1997). The clinical significance of this is unclear. None of the metabolites are thought to contribute significantly to either efficacy or toxicity because busulfan is a more potent non-specific alkylating agent (Hassan and Ehrsson 1987; Commandeur, Stijntjes et al. 1995). Elimination Mean absolute CL values for intravenous busulfan were consistent across studies submitted, ranging from 2.25 mL/min/kg to 2.74 mL/min/kg. There was no significant difference in CL between dose 1 and dose 9 for oral busulfan. Clearance has been described as constant whatever the age except in very young  children  (&lt;  4  years)  who  presented  higher  values  (Vassal,  Gouyette  et  al.  1989;  Grochow, Krivit et al. 1990). In human, approximately 45% and 60% of a sulphur ( 35 S) radiolabelled dose was excreted into urine within  48  hours  when  administering  busulfan  I.V.  and  orally  respectively  (Nadkarni,  Trams  et  al. 1959). When using a carbon-radiolabelled dose, approximately 30% were excreted in urine by both routes.  Negligible  amounts  of  radiolabelled  drug  were  recovered  in  faeces.  Discrepancies  between sulphur and carbon labelling are most likely due to elimination of the sulphur atom from the molecule when  busulfan  was  metabolised  (forming  methane  sulphonic  acid),  whereas  the  labelled  carbon remained in the butane chain of busulfan. The lack of complete recovery in urine may be due to longlived metabolites production or more likely to non-specific alkylation of macromolecules. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Only 1 to 2% of an oral dose of busulfan is eliminated unchanged in human urine (Ehrsson, Hassan et al. 1983; Hassan, Oberg et al. 1989).

Following intravenous administration, the mean half-life of busulfan ranged from 2.83 hours to 3.90 hours in the four OMC studies. Oral busulfan had a mean half-life of 3.87 hours in OMC-BUS 2 and a mean half-life of 3.55 hours in Amendment 4 to OMC-BUS 3&amp;4. For the doses with full blood sampling (rich data), pharmacokinetics was always performed over 6 hours, including

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the 2 h-infusion. This was necessary to comply with the established administration schedule of dosing every 6 hours.

## Pharmacokinetic Linearity

The  linearity  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  oral  busulfan  has  been  shown  in  a  single  dose-escalation study.  In  this  study,  doses  of  2,  4,  and  6  mg  were  evaluated.  No  dose  dependence  was  observed (Ehrsson, Hassan et al. 1983).

## Bioanalytical methods

Two analytical methods were used during the clinical development of Busilvex for the quantification of plasma busulfan concentrations.  A HPLC method with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). The HPLC-UV method was validated over the range of 50 to 10000 ng/mL of busulfan. This method was used in study OMC-BUS 2.  A  gas  chromatography  with  mass  spectrometry  detection  (GC-MSD)  was  validated  over  the range of 65.5 to 3750 ng/mL. The GC-MSD was used in studies OMC-BUS 3, OMC-BUS 4, and in the amendments to studies OMC-BUS 3, OMC-BUS 4. The two methods (HPLC and GC-MSD) were not cross-validated. Pharmacokinetic studies OMC-BUS 2 Study OMC-BUS 2 was a phase open label, multicentre safety, pharmacokinetic study and I. The i.v. dosing of Busilvex (dose 1 for all patients) was escalated from 0.08 to 0.8 mg/kg, with 3 patients in each of the four steps, except for the 0.8 mg/kg dose that was administered to 6 patients (N=15). The individual oral dose of busulfan ranged from 0.86 to 1 mg/kg (Doses 2 to 16). Busulfan treatment was followed by 2 cycles of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg i.v) at day's -3 to -2. After a day of rest bone marrow transplantation or peripheral haematopoetic progenitor/stem cell (re-) transfusion/transplantation was performed on day 0. Results Only 6/15 patients were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. Five patients had broken or missing bioassay samples, 2 vomited their fourth oral dose and 2 had sampling methodology errors. The intrapatient  ratio  of  oral  busulfan  plasma  levels  at  steady  state  vs.  plasma  levels  after  first  dose  i.v  was 90%.  Of  the  6  patients  evaluable  for  the  pharmacokinetic  analysis  3,  received  the  i.v.  dose  of Busilvex finally  selected  for  further  evaluation  (AUC  values  were  943,  1124,  1472,  target  2000  + 1200 µmol-min/L). Amendment 4 of studies OMC-BUS 3 and OMC-BUS 4 Protocol  amendment  4  to  trials  OMC-BUS  3  and  4  was  intended  to  document  the  plasma pharmacokinetics  of  an  initial  high  dose  of  oral  busulfan  (1  mg/kg)  followed  by  15  i.v.  doses  of Busilvex  (0.8  mg/kg).  An  additional  objective  was  to investigate whether  the  repeated i.v. administration  of  0.8  mg/kg  of  Busilvex  were  adequate  for  targeting  an  AUC  &lt;  1500 µ Mol.min, which has been considered by the applicant to be associated with a reduction of the risk of hepatic VOD after oral busulfan. Rich pharmacokinetic samplings were collected over 6 hours at dose 1 (oral) and 9 (i.v.). Sparse pharmacokinetic samplings (trough and peak concentrations) were obtained at dose 13  (i.v.).  Busulfan  dose  per  administration  was  based  on  ideal  body  weight  (IBW)  in  all  but  one patient. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Results

Twelve patients enrolled in studies OMC-BUS 3 and 4 (3 patients of OMC-BUS 3 and 9 patients of OMC-BUS  4)  were  enrolled under amendment  4. Three patients were excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis. Two of them did not reach Cmax after the end of the dosing interval after oral busulfan, and in another the 6-hour plasma sample was drawn after the start of the next i.v.dose. Eleven  out  of  12  (92%)  patients  for  i.v.  busulfan  and  6  out  of  9  (67%)  patients  for  oral  busulfan presented AUC below the targeted 1500 µ Mol·min. Peak and trough values at doses 9 and 13 allowed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to conclude that steady state had been reached at dose 9 and that there seems not to be time-dependent pharmacokinetics with Busilvex. The results are summarised in Table 2.

The intra-patient ratio of oral busulfan plasma levels at first dose v .  plasma levels at steady state at dose 9 i.v. was near 100% .

The target AUC below 1500 µ Mol.min was reached since the first dose in 90% and 87% of patients in OMC-BUS  3  and  OMC-BUS  4  respectively.  The  same  exposure  was  maintained  through  dosing without  adjustment  in  90%  and  93%  of  patients  in  OMC-BUS  3  and  OMC-BUS  4  at  dose  9, respectively.

Oral dose 1 1.0 i.v. dose 9 0.8 Cmax:  Maximal plasma concentration after oral busulfan or at the end of the i.v. administration. Tmax: Time of occurrence of Cmax.

F: The bioavailability factor of oral busulfan, calculated as (AUCinf oral/AUCinf i.v.) x (Dose i.v./Dose oral) x 100 OMC-BUS 3 and OMC-BUS 4 These were two open, multicentre trials to assess the efficacy and safety of Busilvex as conditioning treatment of patients being prepared for autologous (OMC-BUS 3) or allogeneic (OMC-BUS 4) HSCT (see Main studies, under Clinical Efficacy). Methods Blood sampling for full PK characterisation was done at doses 1 and 9. Additionally, peak and trough samplings  were  also  done  at  dose  13.  The  applicant  defined  an  optimal  efficacy  and  tolerability therapeutic window for AUC ranging from 900 to 1500 µMol.min, on the basis of published data. Results The results are summarised in Table 3. Overall, 98/103 patients (39/42 in OMC-BUS 3 and 59/61 in OMC-BUS 4) had complete blood samples available for both doses. In 22 /98 patients (8 in OMCBUS 3 and 14 in OMC-BUS 4), through samples at dose 1 were drawn after the dose 2 infusions had been initiated. These concentrations were excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis. In 22 patients, (7  in  OMC-BUS 3 and 15 in OMC-BUS 4), the dose 9 pre-dose blood samples were drawn either more than 5 minutes before or more than 5 minutes later than the due time. These concentrations were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. In 28 patients, (10 in OMC-BUS 3 and 18 in OMC-BUS 4), trough samples at dose 9 were drawn after the next dose infusion had been initiated. The observed concentrations were replaced by extrapolated concentration values in order to calculate the AUCss. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In OMC-BUS 3 and OMC-BUS 4 studies (103 patients) the incidence of HVOD was not increased in the  shorter  interval  (&lt;  7  h v .  7-15h)  between  the  last  busulfan  dose  and  start  of  cyclophosphamide treatment.

A  case  report  stated  a  possible  interaction  between  ketobemidone  (opioid  analgesic)  and  busulfan during  myeloablative  treatment  in  a  patient  with  AML  (Hassan,  Svensson  et  al.  2000).  Therefore, special care is recommended when combining this drug with busulfan. In one report a longer (24-50h v . 7 -15 h) interval between the last busulfan dose and start of cyclophosphamide treatment has been associated with decreased HVOD occurrence (Hassan, Ehrsson et al. 1996).

4 (0.42-1.77) Dose 9 1.22 ± 18% Population pharmacokinetics A  retrospective  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  was  carried  out  on  patients  with  complete Busilvex treatment (OMC-BUS 3 and OMC-BUS 4). A total of 102 patients were included in the database representing 337 administrations with either complete pharmacokinetic profiles (doses 1 and 9) or limited sampling (doses 2, 8 or 13). In fact, sampling on doses 2 and 8 were not planned in the protocols but inappropriate sampling time at dose 1 (later than 6 hours) or at dose 9 (early pre-dose) provided complementary information. The study was aimed at quantifying the inter-patient variability, intra-patient variability and at determining demographic covariates that might impact those sources of variability. From the ANOVA analysis, combined with Bayesian calculation on doses 1 and 9 only, the inter- and intra-patient variability on AUC were 20% and 10%, respectively. From the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the final model led to an inter- and intra-variability on clearance of 15% and 14%, respectively. The covariates influencing pharmacokinetics were body surface area (BSA) and actual body weight (ABW). BSA was better than ABW in reducing pharmacokinetic variability. Clearance normalised by BSA or weight showed no difference on variability. ABW, adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW), or ideal body weight (IBW) and BSA account for some of the inter-patient difference in clearance. Based on this  analysis,  the  use  of  ABW  in  normal  patients,  but  AIBW  in  obese  patients  respectively  was proposed. Age, gender and race did not show any influence. Diagnosis of CML also accounted for some interpatient variability. No effect of the hepatic status on busulfan clearance was observed. Renal function was not evaluated since all patients had normal or clinically non-significantly abnormal serum  creatinine  levels.  It  has  been  reported  that  less  than  2%  of  a  busulfan  dose  is  excreted unchanged via the kidneys (Ehrsson, Hassan et al. 1983; Hassan, Oberg et al. 1989). Potential drug interactions Anti-fungal drugs are frequently inhibitors of isoform CYP 3A4. This enzyme is likely to be involved in the metabolism pathway of busulfan, but at a late step. One study observed that itraconazole, but not fluconazole, increased busulfan plasma concentrations, and markedly affected the pharmacokinetics of busulfan (Buggia, Zecca et al. 1996). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Paracetamol  less  than  72  hours  prior  to  Busilvex,  or  used  concurrently,  might  result  in  modified busulfan clearance because paracetamol is known to decrease glutathione levels in blood and tissues (Shulman and Hinterberger 1992).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Phenytoin increased the clearance  of  busulfan  by  10%  or  more  in  one  series  (Hassan,  Oberg  et  al. 1993).  However,  the  impact  of  important  co-medications  known  to  interact  with  busulfan,  as phenytoin (virtually all patients had been pre-treated) and itraconazole (only one patient received it concomitantly),  could  not  be  assessed  from  the  data.  5-HT3  antagonists  might  explain  a  small percentage (&lt; 2%) of the inter-patient variability in CL. However, from a clinical point of view, the effect of ondansetron or granisetron is unlikely to be of any significance. Fluconazole had no relevant influence.

## Relationship between PK parameters and HVOD

The relationship between Busilvex pharmacokinetics and the incidence of HVOD was also assessed in an exploratory multivariate analysis (logistic regression) on pooled data from OMC-BUS 3 and 4. Covariates  included  drug  exposure;  clearance,  Cmax,  half-life,  Tmax  and  Vd.  Patient  covariates included  pre-transplant  laboratory  parameters  (alkaline  phosphatase,  SGTP  and  creatinine),  gender, race,  type  of  transplant  and  previous  therapy.  The  covariates  associated  with  an  increased  risk  for HVOD were: high Cmax, higher AUC than the median value (1126 µ Mol.min),  low  pre-treatment serum creatinine and prior haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation. Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology Intravenous  busulfan,  by definition,  has  a  bioavailability  of  100%.    No  new  toxicity  was  identified from dosing with the intravenous formulation or has any toxicity been more severe than with the oral formulation.  This  supported  the  assumption  that  Busilvex  is  not  metabolised  in  a  significantly different way from that of the oral formulation. The amendment 4 to studies OMC-BUS 3 and 4 can be considered as the source of pivotal data for this application with regard to the pharmacokinetic comparability between the oral and i.v. regimens of busulfan as conditioning treatment for bone marrow transplantation. More patients on Busilvex (92%) than on oral busulfan  (67%)  presented  AUC under the  value  of 1500 µ Mol·min, which the applicant considered to be associated with a reduced incidence of hepatic VOD. However, firm conclusions cannot be drawn, also due to the small number of patients included in the analysis. Furthermore, AUCinf values for oral busulfan were unreliable and AUCss values after oral dosing have not been determined taking into account that the experimental terminal half-life has been shown to be around 4 hour and sampling has been done during a 6-hour period.. Pharmacokinetic  comparability  would  have  been  better  evaluated  in  a  randomised  crossover  or parallel study design assessing both formulations at steady state. The data presented from amendment 4 of OMC-BUS 3 and 4 do not allow to assess this. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to assume a lower variability and a higher predictability of busulfan pharmacokinetics after i.v. compared to oral administration. The  applicant  has  not  performed  specific  pharmacokinetic  studies  in  special  populations,  although some results are available from the population pharmacokinetic analysis. The lack of comprehensive information for special populations has been reflected in the SPC. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In patients with hepatic dysfunction there is concern that high-dose busulfan therapy may result in a higher  likelihood  of  transplant  patients  developing  VOD.  The  use  of  busulfan/cyclophosphamide preparation  regimen  requires  special  caution  in  patients  with  hepatic  dysfunction  such  as  active chronic hepatitis and this  has  been  reflected  in  the  SPC.  It  is  unlikely  that  the  pharmacokinetics  of Busilvex in patients with renal dysfunction would be very different from that of patients with normal renal function. Less than 2% of a busulfan dose is excreted unchanged via the kidneys, according to the literature presented. Also, busulfan clearance was not different between the day with or without haemodialysis in two patients with severe renal impairment (Masauzi, Higa et al. 1998; Ullery, Gibbs et al. 2000).

Body size measures can account for some of the inter-patient differences in busulfan clearance. Thus, adjusting the dose of Busilvex on the basis of ABW or AIBW seems justified.

Phenytoin  (and  busulfan  itself)  has  been  shown  to  be  a  busulfan  metabolism  inductor,  and  was associated with a significant decrease of busulfan AUC between dose 1 and dose 16 and an increase in apparent  clearance  (Hassan,  Oberg  et  al.  1993).  No  pharmacokinetic  interaction  was  observed  with

diazepam (Hassan, Oberg et al. 1993). Others did not observe this interaction with either of the two anticonvulsant agents (Embree, Heggie et al. 1997). From the data presented, there is no experience on the co-administration of intravenous busulfan with antiepileptic drugs other than phenytoin.

The  substitution  of  phenytoin  by  other  anticonvulsant  could  change  plasma  Busulfan  levels,  and modify the efficacy and the toxicity profile of i.v. busulfan, and this has been  reflected in the SPC. The applicant has committed to conduct a phase I study using benzadiazepine prophylaxis to study the impact on the pharmacokinetics profile of busulfan, to be conducted as a follow-up measure.

Other potential drug interactions related to itraconazole, ketobemidone, paracetamol, and those related to  the  time  interval  between  busulfan  and  cyclophosphamide  have  been  adequately  reflected  in  the SPC. Clinical efficacy HSCT  for  adult  patients  with  advanced  haematological  malignancies.  Two  additional  supportive efficacy and safety studies have been completed in adult patients (OMC-BUS 6 and OMC-BUS 7 A study in paediatric patients (OMC-BUS 5) has also been completed. All clinical trials were conducted according to GCP. Main studies Patients and methods The OMC-BUS-3 and  OMC-BUS-4 protocols were prospective, multi-centre, open-label, uncontrolled Phase II studies to investigate the safety and efficacy of Busilvex in combination with cyclophosphamide as  a  conditioning  regimen  for  patients  undergoing  autologous  (OMC-BUS-3)  or allogeneic (OMC-BUS-4) HSCT  (marrow or peripheral blood-derived progenitor cells) for haematological malignancies. The two protocols were similar with the exception of the source of stem cells  and  the  management  of  GVHD.  In  these  trials,  Busilvex  0.8  mg/kg  was  administered intravenously  over  two  hours  via  a  central  venous  catheter  every  six  hours  for  a  total  of  16  doses (BMT day-7 through day -4). Cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day was administered intravenously via a central venous catheter (BMT day -3 through day -2). The dose of Busilvex was adjusted according to ideal  body  weight  (IBW)  or  actual  body  weight  (ABW),  whichever  proved  smallest.  No  dose adjustment was done over the 4-day treatment. The main objectives of the studies were to demonstrate that this regimen was myeloablative and supportive of engraftment, and to determine the safety, and the plasma pharmacokinetics profile of intravenous busulfan. Selection criteria Patients with the following diseases were eligible to enter the studies:  Acute leukaemia past first remission, in first or subsequent relapse, in first remission (high-risk) or induction failures.  Chronic myelogenous leukaemia in chronic phase, accelerated phase or blast crisis.  Primary refractory or resistant relapsed Hodgkin's disease (HD) or malignant lymphoma.  Myelodysplastic syndromes. In addition, patients had to meet the following criteria: Medicinal product no longer authorised

OMC-BUS 3: All autologous transplantation patients were required to have ≥ 1 × 10 8 marrow derived mononuclear  cells/kg  with ≥ 1 × 10 4 CFU-GM/kg  and/or ≥ 0.7 × 10 6 CD34+  cells/kg  harvested  and cryopreserved while in remission, as documented by bilateral aspirates and biopsies within four weeks prior to harvest or &gt; 4 × 10 8 peripheral mononuclear blood cells/kg with ≥ 4 × 10 4 CFU-GM/kg and/or ≥ 4 × 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg.

OMC-BUS  4: For  allogeneic  transplantation:  &gt;1 × 10 8 marrow  mononuclear  cells/kg  from  normal, HLA-matched  related  donors.  The  marrow  should  not  be  T-cell  depleted.  The  marrow  collections must contain at least 2 × 10 8 nucleated cells/kg or 1 × 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg. The marrow from the normal donor may be processed per routine procedure for major or minor ABO-incompatibilities.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As an alternative to marrow, filgrastim-mobilised peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) may have been collected from HLA-matched related donors in 1-4 apheresis and cryopreserved. The apheresis collections had to contain at least 1.1 × 10 9 nucleated cells/kg or 4 × 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg.

To be eligible, patients also had to meet the following screening criteria: Physiological age 15 to 55 years;  ZUBROD  performance  status  &lt;2;  Left  ventricular  ejection  fraction ≥ 50%;  no  uncontrolled arrhythmias or symptomatic cardiac disease; Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), forced vital  capacity  (FVC),  and  diffusion  capacity  of  carbon  monoxide  (DLCO) ≥ 50%  of  expected, corrected for haemoglobin; no symptomatic pulmonary disease; Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≤ 3  times  upper  limit  of  normal,  serum  bilirubin,  alkaline  phosphatase  (optional)  and  serum creatinine within accepted laboratory standard normal limits or considered clinically non-significant; no evidence of chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis (any positive hepatitis serology was discussed with the study chairman and a liver biopsy was considered); no effusion or ascites ≥ 1 L prior to drainage; Life  expectancy  not  severely  limited  by  concomitant  illness  and  expected  to  be  &gt;12  weeks;  HIVnegative; Patient was not pregnant; Patient or patient's legal representative, parent(s) or guardian was able to sign informed consent; and had central venous access secured through an indwelling catheter; Patients  should  not  eligible  for  a  chemotherapy  preparation  protocol of  higher  institutional  priority; Patients  should  not  have  received  any  other  investigational  drugs  within  30  days  of  planned administration of busulfan.

There  was  no  pre-specified  statistical  hypothesis.  Sample  size  was  not  pre-specified  in  the  original protocols. Amendment 1 set the upper limit of enrolment to a total of 45 patients and amendment 3 increased the maximum number of patients to 100.

Concomitant therapy For  Busilvex  injection  administration,  phenytoin  and  anti-emetics  were  to  be  given  to  all  patients prior to the first dose of Busilvex and continued on a fixed schedule through 12-24 hours after the last dose  of  cyclophosphamide.  For  cyclophosphamide  administration,  I.V.  fluid  with  bicarbonate,  antiemetics and mesna were recommended per institutional guidelines. Each clinical centre was allowed to follow their institutional guidelines for HSCT. Recommended  supportive  care  included:  G-CSF  5  mcg/kg/d  subcutaneous  from  BMT  day  0  until ANC &gt; 3500/mcL for three or more days or according to institutional guidelines, cytosine arabinoside for  CNS prophylaxis where appropriate, starting at the time of haematological recovery, defined as ANC &gt; 1500/mcL off G-CSF and platelet count &gt; 50000/mcL. Allopurinol, menstrual suppression, prophylactic  antibiotics,  empirical  antibiotics,  I.V.  hyperalimentation,  etc.,  and  GVHD  prophylaxis were allowed according to institutional guidelines. Efficacy  endpoints  included  short-term  (myeloablation,  median  time  of  engraftment)  and  long-term end points (disease-free survival, relapse, survival and transplant-related mortality). Endpoint definitions Myeloablation  was  defined  as  any  one  or  the  combination  of  the  following:  neutropenia  (ANC  &lt; 0.5 × 10 9 /L),  lymphopenia  (ALC  &lt;  0.1 × 10 9 /L),  thrombocytopenia  (platelet  count  of  &lt;  20 × 10 9 /L)  or bleeding  requiring  platelet  transfusion.  Engraftment  was  recorded  as  the  day  the  ANC  exceeded 0.5 × 10 9 /L.  Non  engraftment  was  defined  for  the  purpose  of  these  studies  as  the  failure  to  reach  an ANC &gt; 0.5 × 10 9 /L  within  100  days  after  transplantation.  In  addition,  patients  who  engrafted  at  this time, but who developed an ANC &lt; 0.5 × 10 9 /L thereafter were classified as late rejection or late graft failure. The clinical engraftment was confirmed by demonstration of donor cells in T-lymphocyte and haematopoietic  lineage  (chimerism).  Relapse  was  defined  as  the  day  of  detection  of  disease recurrence. Disease free survival (DFS) was defined as the documented day of death or relapse.

## Results

42 and 62 patients were enrolled respectively in OMC-BUS 3 and OMC-BUS 4 studies. The summary of patient characteristics is shown in Table 4. OMC-BUS 3: A total of 42 patients were enrolled in this study and were distributed among five study centres. All 42 received the full 16-dose regimen of Busilvex and are included in the analyses. OMC-BUS 4: A total of 62 patients were enrolled in this

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study and were distributed among seven study centres. 61 of these patients received the full 16-dose regimen of Busilvex and are included in the analyses. One patient withdrew before receiving study medication  due  to  the  inability  to  have  blood  samples  drawn  for  pharmacokinetic  analysis.  No additional data were collected for this patient and this patient was excluded from analysis of safety and efficacy. Additionally, two patients were discontinued due to acute mortality during the study period (BMT Day -7 through BMT Day +28). Data for these two patients are included in the study report and analysis.  Overall,  95  out  of  103  (92%)  patients  were  considered  high-risk  for  relapse  with  poor outcome following HSCT in both OMC-BUS 3 and OMC-BUS 4. 63/103 (61%) patients met one or more of the following high-risk criteria: ≥ 3 prior chemotherapy regimens 49 (48%); at least one prior radiation  regimen  including  TBI  38  (37%);  prior  transplant  11  (11%) ] .  A  total  of  81/103  (79%) patients were transplanted whilst in active disease, and 49/103 (48%) patients were both heavily pretreated and transplanted with active disease.

## Myeloablation

In OMC-BUS 3 myeloablation occurred in all patients (42/42). The median time to neutropenia was 4 days (range -7 to +6 ). The median duration of neutropenia and lymphopenia was 6 days (range 2 - 13 days) and 3 days (range 1 - 7 days) respectively. For allogeneic transplantation (OMC-BUS 4), all patients experienced profound myelosuppression (61/61). The median time to neutropenia was 4 days

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(range  -7  to  +5).  The  median  duration  of  neutropenia  was  9  days  (range  1-  28  days)  and  for lymphopenia was 4 days (range 1-19 days ). In this study, donor-derived haematopoiesis (chimerism) was  further  documented  by  cytogenetic  markers,  and/or  Fluorescent  in  Situ  Hybridization  (FISH) and/or Restriction Fragment-Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis in 43 of the 60 evaluable patients at  1  and/or  3  months  post-transplant  (6  patients  did  not  have  tests  performed,  11  patients  had indeterminate results due to a lack of an appropriate marker). Molecular analysis showed that all 43 (100%) patients had documented evidence of donor cell engraftment; 38/43 patients (88%) achieved full chimerism. Five out of 43 (12%) had mixed chimerism (RFLP) with host-type DNA contributed by  persistent  or  recurrent  leukaemic  marrow  cells.  No  patient  had  autologous  recovery  posttransplantation,  nor  did  anyone  later  revert  to  host-derived  haematopoiesis  unless  the  underlying malignancy recurred. No patient with chimerical evidence of allogeneic engraftment suffered a later loss of the allogeneic graft.

At  the  cut  off  date  (January  9,  1998)  98%  and  97%  of  the  patients  had  follow-up  data  for  posttransplantation  day  +28,  74%  and  77%  had been  observed  for  the  short  term  follow  up  (day  +28  +100), and 43% and 33% of the patients had follow up data for more than +100 days in trial OMCBUS 3 and 4 respectively. An update of long term follow up with a cut-off date of June 2000 was also provided.  Relapse  and  survival  data  according  various  cut-offs  are  provided  in  Table  6.  Additional analyses in selected disease categories, and a literature review on high dose oral busulfan by transplant group and disease classification were also submitted (data not shown).

The main results in terms of engrafment are summarised in Table 5. The effect of factors affecting engraftment  was  explored  (methotrexate  use,  stem  cell  source,  G-CSF  use).  No  major  effect  on engraftment was observed for the parameters examined except for a trend toward a shorter time to engraftment  for  PBPC  transplants  (p=0.0725)  and  a  possible  widening  in  the  range  of  time  to engraftment for those patients receiving methotrexate (although the median value was not affected).

A study in paediatric patients (OMC-BUS 5) has been completed. Preliminary results were provided . In  this  study,  Busilvex  was  administered  over  4  days  (at  dose  0.8  and  1.0  mg/kg  ABW  every  six hours  according  to  age  &gt;  4  years  and ≤ 4  years,  respectively)  followed  by  cyclophosphamide administered  over  4  days  (50  mg/kg  in  200  ml  of  D5W  over  one  hour)  as  a  preparative  regimen BuCy4 for allogenic bone marrow or blood progenitor cell transplantation. The target AUC range of 900-1350 µ Mol-min ( ± 5%) was achieved in 21/23 (91%) evaluable patients at steady state. Clinical evidence of myeloablation occurred in 100% (24/24) of the patients and engraftment was observed in 100% patients (23/23) taking into account that one patient died before engraftment could be evaluated. Engraftment  was  established  at  a  median  of  13  days  post-transplant.  The  estimated  probability  of survival at the time of median follow-up (305 days) was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.67 to 0.98).

No. (%) of patients who had died Median (range) time to death (days) Comparison with oral busulfan Two series of high-dose oral busulfan were presented and compared retrospectively to the intravenous data.  The  first  series  consisted  of  patients  that  received oral busulfan  and  cyclophosphamide  as  a preparative regimen for autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation for NHL. Data for 17 patients were available. 11/17 (65%) was defined as high-risk for transplant-related morbidity (at least one of the following: ≥ 3 chemotherapy regimens; prior radiation; prior transplant). All patients received  oral  BuCy2  with  a  dose  of  1mg/kg  busulfan  administered.  These  were  compared  with  the data from the combined i.v. busulfan autologous group (n=47) which consisted of patients with NHL (n=11), HD (n=29) or AML (n=7). I.V. busulfan had similar short-term outcome when compared to oral busulfan in a similar high-risk patient population (data not shown).  The second series consisted of  patients  that  received  oral  busulfan  and  cyclophosphamide  used  as  a  preparative  regimen  for allogeneic  marrow or  peripheral  blood  progenitor  cell  transplantation  for  hematologic  malignancies (Kashyap, Wingard et al. 2002). This series was compared to the patients treated by i.v. busulfan (n= 61,OMC-BUS-4). Patient demographics were similar between the two groups with 93% and 95% (oral vs i.v.,  respectively)  of  patients  being  at  high-risk  for  transplant  related  morbidity  and/or  mortality. For oral busulfan, 28 (93%) patients were evaluable for engraftment (ANC &gt; 0.5x10 9 /L). Engraftment was similar between the two groups with 100% of evaluable patients engrafting in both studies. The probability estimate for overall survival at day +100 was significantly higher in patients treated with Busilvex than with oral busulfan. Special populations Clinical studies investigating the efficacy and safety of Busilvex in special populations have not been submitted. A reduced number of patients between the ages of 55-63 were treated with Busilvex and no special findings were reported. Oral busulfan as conditioning therapy for HSCT is being used in children, however, no information was provided. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Supportive studies

OMC-BUS 6 and OMC-BUS 7. Both  supportive  trials  were  prospective,  single-centre  open-label uncontrolled  studies  of  Busilvex  in  patients  undergoing  autologous  (OMC-BUS  6)  or  allogeneic (OMC-BUS 7) transplantation in the treatment of haematological malignancies.

All 23 (100%) patients treated with Busilvex engrafted as demonstrated by ANC &gt; 0.5 x10 9 /L. The time  to  patient  engraftment  ranged  from  BMT  Day  +9  to  BMT  Day  +10  for  the  two  autologous transplant recipients while median time for patient engraftment was BMT Day +13 (range BMT Day +10 to BMT Day +20) for the 21 allogeneic transplant recipients. Patients were discharged from the hospital  in  a  median  of  15  days  post-transplant  (range  10-27).  19/19  evaluable  patients  showed evidence of donor cell engraftment. 17/19 was donor cell only, for at least one of the evaluations. 8/17 (47%)  had  stable  sustained  engraftment  for  three  months  or  greater.  Fourteen  of  these  17  (82%) patients remained donor cell only at the last observation (median follow-up 91 days; range 32-412). As of the date of data cut-off (June 24, 1999), no late graft failures had been reported.

In summary, concerning clinical efficacy, the clinical data submitted are supportive of the efficacy of Busilvex as conditioning regimen in patients undergoing HSCT. Prospective randomised comparative data of intravenous v. oral busulfan would have been preferable. However, in view of the nature of the dossier  (new  formulation  of  a  known  substance),  and  the  well-established  use  of  oral  busulfan  as conditioning  regimen  for  HSCT,  the  demonstration  of  the  pharmacokinetic  comparability  of  both formulations together with supportive efficacy data is sufficient.

As of the clinical cut-off date for this study (June 24, 1999), the median follow-up for all patients was 190 days (range 11 to 412 days). At the last available follow-up, 87% (20/23) of patients were alive (N=2,  autologous  and  N=18,  allogeneic)  and  13  of  these  20  (56%)  surviving  patients  remained disease-free. 7/23 patients had relapsed on or before the data cut-off date (June 24, 1999). Discussion on Clinical Efficacy The efficacy and safety of Busilvex as conditioning treatment in allogeneic and autologous HSCT has been  investigated  in  two  pivotal  phase  II  trials.  The  trials  were  conducted  concurrently  and  were virtually  identical  with  the  exception  of  the  source  of  stem  cells  and  concomitant  therapy  for prophylaxis of GVHD. The  protocols  have  considered  patients  with  haematological  malignancies  that  are  candidates  for HSCT.  Selection  criteria  were  similar  for  both  studies,  with  the  exception  of  the  source  of  the progenitor cells to be transplanted (autologous v . allogeneic). This selected different populations, as in clinical  practice  the  indications  for  autologous  and  allogeneic  transplantation  are  not  the  same (predominance of lymphoma patients in BUS 3 and leukaemia patients in BUS 4). Concerning  short-term  efficacy,  all  patients  showed  engraftment  and  this  occurred  at  the  expected time. Although, it is difficult to relate this outcome of the transplant exclusively to busulfan therapy, this  result  can  be  considered  positive  and  an  indirect  measure  of  the  myelosuppresive  activity  of Busilvex. Disease-free survival, and overall survival are the most relevant efficacy endpoints for conditioning regimens prior HSCT. The sparse number of patients enrolled in these trials (n = 103) and the short follow-up  do  not  allow  a  thorough  evaluation  of  such  outcomes.  Although  a  high  rate  of  disease recurrence was observed in the autologous group, these results were expected. The number of patients was too limited as to allow for a disease-specific analysis. No  comprehensive  information  with  regard  to  Busilvex  pharmacokinetics  in  children  has  been submitted.  The  applicant  has  committed  to  provide  the  full  data  package  in  children  as  soon  as  it becomes available. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

The safety database for Busilvex in combination with cyclophosphamide as a conditioning regimen with the proposed dose schedule for progenitor cell transplantation consisted of a total of 103 patients,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

aged  18  to  63  years,  enrolled  in  studies  OMC-BUS  3  (N=42)  and  OMC-BUS  4  (N=61).  Data  on serious adverse events, other adverse events and toxicity grades 3 or 4 were collected up to 100 days post-transplant. A summary of post-marketing adverse drug experience with Busilvex in USA were also provided. In addition, results from OMC-BUS 6 &amp; 7 have been included in this application. Study OMC-BUS 2 (only the first of 16 doses was intravenous busulfan) was excluded.

All  103  patients  included  in  the  primary  safety  database  received  a  total  of  16  doses  of  Busilvex injection administered via a central venous catheter. Each dose was delivered over two hours every six hours  for  four  consecutive  days.  Six  patients  experienced  a  delay  in  receiving  a  dose  due  to  either technical difficulties associated with the pump and/or administrative error (n=5) or evaluation of an adverse  event  (n=1).  Doses  were  calculated  to  deliver  0.8mg/kg  body  weight.  Dosage  calculations were based upon either actual (n=25), ideal (n=65), or adjusted ideal (n=11) patients body weight per individual  institutional  guidelines.  Total  doses  of  Busilvex  injection  ranged  from  33  mg  to  76  mg with  the  average  total  dose  for  the  safety  population  being  56  mg  per  6-hour  dosing  interval.  No dosage adjustment was required.

Invasive infections (39%) were more common in patients having undergone an allogeneic transplant. Other  adverse  events  included  capillary  leak  syndrome  (one  case),  and  oedema,  hypervolemia  or weight  increase  (71%);  GVHD  (15%);  lung  toxicity;  seizures;  (one  case),  mild  or  moderate  pain (93%), chills (47%) asthenia (56%) (one G3), allergic reactions (32%), inflammation at an injection site (23%), abdominal enlargement (16%), ascites (2%).

Following Busilvex injection treatment, patients received cyclophosphamide at a dose of 60 mg/kg administered intravenously over one hour on two consecutive days (BMT Day -3 and BMT Day -2). The minimum total dose of cyclophosphamide was 2454 mg and the maximum dose administered was 6300 mg. BMT Day -1 was a day of rest (no chemotherapy) prior to infusion of haematopoietic progenitor cells (either  autologous  OMC-BUS 3 or allogeneic OMC-BUS 4) on BMT Day 0. Only supportive care procedures were provided from BMT Day +1 through BMT Day +28. No patients  prematurely discontinued  study  drug; however, three patients  discontinued  from  OMCBUS 3 and OMC-BUS 4 prior to the completion of 36-day study period (BMT Day -7 through BMT Day +28). One patient (OMC-BUS 3) requested withdrawal from the study on BMT Day +15 due to disease progression requiring an alternative course of chemotherapy. Two patients (OMC-BUS 4) died on BMT Day +27 and BMT Day +20 respectively. Causes of death were pneumonia (with pulmonary haemorrhage) and respiratory failure secondary to aspergillus pneumonia, respectively Adverse events and serious adverse event/deaths All 103 patients experienced at least one AE during the 36-days study period. Most of the reported adverse events were already well known events for oral busulfan, commonly encountered following myeloablative-conditioning therapy, including TBI, high-dose busulfan and alternative chemotherapy combinations. No patients discontinued the study drug due to an AE. Adverse events were analysed by gender, age, race, diagnosis and pre-treatment subgroups. With a threshold for differences between subgroups, a greater number of AEs were more commonly reported in females (allergic reaction, hypotension, constipation, rhinitis, cough increase, pharyngitis, pruritus, and pain ear) than in males (infection, hypocalcemia and SGPT increase) (Frequency of occurrence differed by ≥ 15%) and a greater number were more commonly reported in patients over 50 years old than in younger patients. No other subgroup differences were observed. The majority of the AEs were mild or moderate. The most frequently reported AEs, during the defined study  period,  were  nausea  (97%),  stomatitis  (96%),  leucopenia  (96%),  thrombocytopenia  (94%), vomiting (91%), anaemia (88%), fever (87%), anorexia (80%), diarrhea (80%) and insomnia (80%).

Cardiovascular toxicity included tachycardia (50%),  arrhythmia (3%), atrial fibrillation (2%), ventricular  extrasystoles  (1%)  and  bradycardia  (1%),  hypotension  (17%)  and  hypertension  (25%), thrombosis  (27%),  cardiomegaly  (n=3%),  ECG  abnormality (n=1%);  pericardial  effusion   (n=1%); decreased  ejection  fraction   (n=1%),  and  pericarditis   (n=1%).  Toxicity  to  the  digestive  system included: dyspepsia (40%) and constipation (31%), rectal disorders (24%), jaundice (8%), ileus (7%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hepatomegaly (5%), pancreatitis (2%). Splenomegaly (4%). For the metabolic and nutritional system this included potentially clinically significant elevations in glucose, and electrolyte abnormalities.

VOD  was  observed  in  6  patients  (serious  in  5  patients  and  fatal  in  two).  For  five  patients  liver dysfunction was a part of multi-organ failure preceding death.

Musculoskeletal toxicity occurred in less than 20% of the patients. Other toxicity involved the nervous system:  insomnia  (80%,  one  severe),  anxiety  (65%),  dizziness  (26%)  and  depression  (20%);  G3 serious delirium, G4 coma and G4 cerebral haemorrhage, the respiratory system: rhinitis (44%) and cough  (36%) epistaxis (23%), hyperventilation (5%), asthma (7%), atelectasis (3%), pleural effusion (3%) and hypoxia (1%); the skin and appendages: rush (50%), pruritus (30), urticaria (n=3), alopecia (n=15),  blisters  (n=8),  maculopapular  rashes  (n=7)  and  purpura  rash  (n=1);  the  special  senses  (less than 20% of the patients); and the urogenital system: haematuria (n=9, 1 G3), haemorrhagic cystitis (n=2, 1 severe), moderate renal insufficiency (n=2%).

VOD is  a  well  recognised  and  a  potentially  serious  complication  of  high  dose  chemotherapy  and irradiation  administered  to  patients  prior  to  transplant.  Two  patients  had  VOD  rated  moderate  in severity, two had life-threatening VOD, and two had fatal VOD. Five of the six events were reported as serious. VOD and high-dose busulfan correlation has been analysed in the literature reviewing the use of oral busulfan. Specifically, the literature analysis reports that VOD occurs with a frequency of approximately 20% in patients who receive high-dose busulfan-based conditioning regimens prior to HSCT.

Serious adverse events (SAE) In the combined studies OMC-BUS 3 and OMC-BUS 4, 26/103 (25%) had a single serious adverse event (SAE), 10/103 (10%) two SAE, 3/103 (3%) three SAE, and one patient (1%) four SAE; 63/103 (61%)  patients  experienced  no  SAE  (Table  7).  Two  SAEs  (acute  delirium  and  hypotension)  were unexpected. Both occurred (in different patients) prior to transplant; treatment was not interrupted for the delirium but the second cyclophosphamide dose was substituted with melphalan for hypotension. Table 7.

In the Busilvex studies, the diagnosis of VOD was based upon clinical examination and laboratory findings and verified retrospectively using the Jones' Criteria by an independent central reviewer. In the combined OMC-BUS 3 and OMC-BUS 4 studies, the overall incidence of VOD and VOD-related

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mortality  was  5.8%  (6/103)  and  2%  (2/103),  respectively  (Table  8).  VOD  was  confirmed  by  liver biopsy in 3/6 (50%) patients. Five of these events were reported as serious. Four patients out of the six who presented VOD were transplanted with active malignancy, and all met at least one criterion for extensive  prior  therapy  (i.e. ≥ 3  prior  chemotherapy  regimens,  prior  irradiation,  and/or  prior transplant). Twenty-six out of 103 (25%) patients, had baseline evidence of liver abnormalities. Two out of these 26 patients developed VOD. None of the other 24 patients with evidence of pre-transplant liver impairment developed VOD.

Risk factors for hepaticVOD The  association  between  high-dose  busulfan  and  hepatic  VOD  is  well  known  (Kennedy  1986; Grochow, Jones et al. 1989; Slattery, Sanders et al. 1995; Dix, Wingard et al. 1996; Ljungman, Hassan et  al.  1997).  Hepatic  VOD  occurs  with  a  frequency  of  approximately  20%  in  patients  who  receive high-dose  busulfan-based  conditioning  regimens  prior  to  HSCT.  High  exposure  to  busulfan  may increase its incidence by up to 10 fold (Dix, Wingard et al. 1996). AUC of 1500 µMol.min has been described as a relatively sharp cut-off level above, which there is very high risk of hepatic VOD. Subsequently, the possibility of AUC guided dose adjustment has been proposed (Grochow, Jones et al. 1989; Grochow 1993). A number of treatment-related and patient-related factors have been identified as predisposing patients to  the  development  of  hepatic  VOD  after  HSCT:  autologous v. comparably  conditioned  allogeneic recipients, second transplants preceded by second courses of high-dose chemotherapy, prior radiation therapy, and the elevation of liver enzymes before transplantation. In patients undergoing first transplant, hepatic VOD was observed in 4/92 (4.3%, including one fatal case)  cases,  compared  to  2/11  (18%,  including  one  fatal  case)  cases  for  patients  previously transplanted. Hepatic VOD was observed in 5/61 (8.2%) allogeneic compared to   1/42 (2.5%) autologous transplant recipients. Both cases of fatal hepatic VOD occurred in allogeneic patients. Concerning  disease  subgroups,  hepatic  VOD  was  observed  in  1/16  (6.2%)  lymphoma  patients  and 1/17 (5.7%) CML patients. Medicinal product no longer authorised

A complementary analysis on pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic relationship about hepatic VOD has  been  performed  through  multivariate  analysis  of  pooled  data  (OMC-BUS  3 and  OMC-BUS 4). High  busulfan  Cmax  and  higher  than  median  AUC  (1126  µMol.min),  prior  HSCT,  and  low  pretreatment  serum  creatinine  were  associated  with  increased  risk  of  hepatic  VOD.  In  allotransplanted patients  only  (OMC-BUS  4),  prior  radiation  therapy,  high  pre-treatment  SGPT,  low  pre-treatment serum creatinine, higher than median AUC and low plasma busulfan clearance were associated with hepatic VOD.

In univariate analysis, combination of higher than median AUC (1084 µMol.min) and prior irradiation (most often TBI) resulted in an incidence of 4/9 hepatic VOD (44%) while the incidence of hepatic VOD in  patients  with  no  prior  irradiation  therapy  and  low  AUC  was  0/21  (0%).  In  addition,  the combination of higher than median AUC and prior radiation accounted for 4/5 (80%) of the total cases of hepatic VOD in allogeneic patient group.

## Deaths

The  overall  mortality  and  treatment-related  mortality  (TRM)  rates  were  28%  (29/103)  and  16% (16/103),  respectively.  The  incidence  of  total  and  non-relapse  mortality  remains  higher  in  the allogeneic than in the autologous transplant subgroups: 33% (20/61) and 23% (14/61) v. 21% (9/42) and 5% (2/42), respectively.

Safety data were also obtained from the supportive OMC-BUS 6 &amp; 7 studies. All 23 patients (100%) received  the  complete  16-dose  regimen  of  Busilvex  (0.8  mg/kg)  administered  intravenously  via  a central venous catheter. There were no safety-related dose adjustments required for any patients. The safety profile consisted of well-described toxicities commonly encountered during HSCT. A total of 16  SAEs  (four  were  judged  possibly  related  to  busulfan)  were  reported  in  9  patients  without unexpected SAEs; 9/16 SAEs involved infection (including fever and the episode of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage secondary to bacteremia/pneumonia); 6 SAEs were of immunologic origin and 1 SAE was for nausea resulting in prolonged hospitalisation due to the associated anorexia and weight loss. No cases of  VOD were observed.

In  OMC-BUS-4 (allogeneic),  of  the  20  patients  who  died,  13  (65%)  were  transplanted  with  active disease, 10 (50%) were heavily pre-treated, and 6 (20%) were &gt; 50 years old. Patients with heavy pretreatment died earlier than those not heavily pre-treated prior HSCT. In OMC-BUS-3 (autologous), six of the nine (67%) patients who died were transplanted with active disease,  8  (89%)  were  heavily  pre-treated  (67%  were  both),  and  3  (33%)  were  &gt;  50  years  old. Comparative data were provided from a literature review. For autologous HSCT for lymphoma, with the use of busulfan-based therapy and/or other regimens, the treatment-related mortality ranged from 3% to  7% for  patients  with  standard  risk,  while  it  was  higher  above  10%  for  those  with  advanced disease.  For  allogeneic  HSCT,  the  overall  treatment-related  mortality  following  busulfan-based conditioning  regimen  ranged  from  12%  to  30%,  and  it  was  higher  &gt;  40%  in  high-risk  patients (advanced disease, heavily pre-treated). Most serious toxicities with high-dose busulfan involved the liver, lungs, and the nervous system. Laboratory findings Haematology All  subjects  exhibited  one  or  more  potentially  clinically  significant  hematology  abnormalities. Hematological  abnormalities  were  an  expected  consequence  and  desirable  end-point  of  BuCy combination  therapy.  No  patients  discontinued  the  study  due  to  clinically  significant  hematology abnormalities. Abnormalities included anemia, leucopenia, neutropenia lynphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia. The majority of patients (101/103, 98%) required platelet transfusion  during the 36-day study period. The maximum number of transfusion required was 27. Clinical Chemistry All but one  patient exhibited  one or more  potentially clinically significant blood  chemistry abnormality. Abnormalities occurred with glucose, kidney function tests, electrolytes, serum proteins, serum uric acids and liver function tests. Abnormal values reflecting liver dysfunction were recorded in 100 patients. These included elevated LDH (n=66), serum bilirubin (n=40) with associated elevations of SGPT and/or SGOT; elevations in SGPT (n=82); SGOT (n=43).

Three deaths occurred in the studies OMC-BUS 6 &amp; 7, according to preliminary results in 23 patients. All  three  occurred  in  patients  who  had  received  allogeneic  transplantation  and  all  three  were associated  either  directly  or  indirectly  with  infection.  Two  of  the  deaths  occurred  after  BMT  Day

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

+250, as a direct consequence of infection (pneumonia and sepsis). A third patient died on BMT Day +77  as  a  result  of  multi-organ  system  failure  and  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome,  as  a consequence of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, which was secondary to pneumonia/haemoptysis. No acute mortality ( ≤ day 28 post transplant) was reported.

## Safety in special populations

## Paediatric patients (OMC-BUS 5)

All  patients  had  episodes  of  vomiting  and  most  also  had  nausea.  22/24  patients  had  liver  toxicity (observed as elevation of liver enzymes or bilirrubin, abdominal pain or VOD). In total, 5 patients had VOD. One case was resolved in three days and not considered SAE and the rest of VOD cases are described  above  (see  SAEs).  Other  AEs  were  considered  tachycardia  (54%),  hypotension  (17%), hypertension (58%), and a larger number of common AEs. 16/24 patients (67%) experienced at least one SAE: infection (18), hepatobiliary disease (9), respiratory disease (4), cardiovascular disease (2), capillary leak syndrome (2), GVHD (2), to multisystem organ failure (2), seizure (1) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (1). Serious hepatobiliary toxicity was reported in five children. Three episodes of hyperbilirubinemia and three of hepatic VOD were related to the BuCy preparative regimen, 2 of these hepatic VOD cases resolved in 9 and10 days respectively and the last episode was unresolved at death. There were 2 (8%) acute (Day-10 to BMT Day +29), and 2 (8%) short-term post study surveillance (BMT Day+29 to BMT Day +100) deaths.  Three of the four patients who died had been heavily pretreated  and  the  last  one  was  transfusion  dependent  at  the  time  of  enrolment.  No  patients  were discontinued or withdrawn from the study due to adverse events related to Busilvex. Post marketing survey Since the first marketing authorisation in the US (February 1999more than 5000 patients were treated worldwide. Seven adverse drug events (AEs) concerning 5 patients were reported to the sponsor (VOD; hepatomegaly, aspergilloma and sepsis; pulmonary haemorrhage; acute pulmonary toxicity; myocardiopathy). Dimethylacetamide The  potential  influence  of  dimethylacetamide  (DMA)  on  neurological,  cardiovascular  and  hepatic safety profiles has been investigated. Review of the i.v. busulfan data and comparison to oral busulfan data data did not reveal any increased incidence of events in the i.v. busulfan group in any of the three systems of interest CNS, cardiovascular or hepatic. i. v. busulfan behaved in a similar fashion to oral busulfan  in  terms  of  CNS,  cardiovascular  and  hepatic  adverse  events  and  did  not  appear  to  be associated with additional toxicity due to DMA compared to oral busulfan. Discussion on Clinical Safety Busilvex  Injection  is  expected  to  enhance  ease  and  convenience  of  administration  of  the  drug, decreasing the variability in absorption, eliminating the first pass effect, and enhancing a physician's ability  to  maintain  blood  levels  within  an  optimal  therapeutic  window.  Although  the  number  of patients included in the safety database was low, the applicant relies on the fact that oral busulfan is a drug with an extensive and well-established use in the target population.

The pattern of adverse events and serious adverse events reported in OMC-BUS 3 &amp; 4 safety data was similar to that reported for high-dose oral busulfan therapy. The most frequently AE reported in OMCBUS 3 &amp; 4 (nausea,  stomatitis,  leucopenia,  thrombocytopenia,  vomiting,  anaemia,  fever,  anorexia, diarrhoea and insomnia) are commonly encountered in oral busulfan literature. The majority of deaths occurring  in  the  two  pivotal  studies  were  mainly  related  to  disease  progression,  infection  or complication secondary to infection.

Busulfan  has  been  reported  to  produce  dose-related  neurotoxic  effects  in  some  patients  that  are clinically characterised by  myoclonic movements  and  seizures. Seizures may  occur at high myeloablative doses of oral busulfan as early as the second treatment (Buggia, Locatelli et al. 1994; Vassal  1994).  Phenytoin  and  anti-emetics  were  to  be  given  to  all  patients  prior  to  the  first  dose  of Busilvex and continued on a fixed schedule through 12-24 hours after the last dose of cyclophosphamide.

In retrospective comparisons, hepatic VOD incidence appears to be lower than that observed with oral busulfan. It  would  seem plausible that i.v. administration should lead to a lower variable pharmacokinetics  and  to  a  better  control  of  exposure,  leading  theoretically  to  a  lower  incidence  of VOD. However, as prospective comparative safety data are lacking, it is not possible to definitively confirm this hypothesis.

Patients with hepatic dysfunction, particularly if severe, may be at a higher risk of developing VOD when receiving the busulfan/cyclophosphamide preparation, and this is reflected as a warning in the SPC.

The  safety  profile  observed  over  3  years  post-marketing  survey  did  not  modify  that  one  observed during the clinical development. In conclusion, the safety profile can be considered as comparable to that of the oral busulfan, with the possibility that the incidence of some toxicity with Busilvex may be lower. A complete analysis of potential toxicity of DMA has been provided. No significant differences have been found between i.v. and oral busulfan in terms of CNS, cardiovascular system and liver functions have been observed. 5. Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment Quality The purity of busulfan active substance, and the control of the manufacturing process and specification for the finished product indicate reliable in vitro reproducibility of this medicinal product. Stability has been shown to be satisfactory; this in turn should indicate a uniform performance in the clinic. There are no unresolved quality issues which could have a negative impact on the benefit / risk balance of the product. Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology Busulfan is a bifunctional alkylating agent in which two labile methanesulphonate groups are attached to opposite ends of a four-carbon alkyl chain. In aqueous media, busulfan hydrolyzes to release the methanesulfonate  groups.  This  produces  reactive  carbonium  ions  that  can  alkylate  DNA.  DNA damage is thought to be responsible for much of the cytotoxicity of busulfan. Rapid tissue of Busulfan distribution has been demonstrated in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. In the distribution  study  in  monkeys,  the  liver  was  found  to  accumulate  increasing  amounts  of  busulfan throughout a 45-minute observation period. In this period, the compound showed also a tendency to accumulate in the lungs with time. As a small lipophilic molecule busulfan has been determined to easily cross the blood brain barrier. Its presence in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been recorded in humans at concentrations equivalent to or slightly higher than plasma levels. Distribution studies in animals showed similar results. Busulfan  is  metabolized  extensively  and  the  main  metabolites  are  the  same  in  human  and  rats. Busulfan  is  predominantly  metabolized  by  conjugation  with  glutathion,  both  spontaneously  and  by glutathione  S-transferase  (GST)  catalysis.  This  conjugate  undergoes  further  extensive  oxidative metabolism probably in the liver. This oxidative metabolism probably involves the cytochrome P450 system.

The  major  part  of  the  metabolites  is  eliminated  via  renal  and  the  faecal  excretion  is  a  minor elimination route in human and rat.

Most of the toxicology studies in the application were based on the literature of oral busulfan. Overall, the main toxicity of busulfan is neurotoxicity and damage to the liver.

Taking into account the toxicological profile of DMA, a Major objection was presented in relation to the  content  of  this  excipient.  Although  from  the  preclinical  data  it  could  be  concluded  that hepatotoxicity due to DMA cannot be discarded, taking into account that the content of DMA in the formulation has been reasonably justified and that, according to the clinical data, Busilvex did not appear to be associated with additional toxicity compared to oral busulfan, the overall benefit/risk is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

considered  positive,  and  this  issue  is  resolved.  Several  points  to  clarify  related  to  local  tolerance evaluation, environmental risk assessment, and other toxicological aspects, were raised. The Company has answered adequately and the questions are considered resolved.

Based on the data submitted, no adverse environmental effects are predicted from the medicinal use of Busilvex.

## Efficacy

Oral  busulfan  is  a  drug  widely  used  as  a  part  of  conditioning  regimens  before  HSCT.  Busilvex Injection  is  expected  to  enhance  easy  and  convenient  administration  of  the  drug,  decreasing  the variability in absorption, eliminating the first pass effect, and enhancing physician's ability to maintain blood levels within an optimal therapeutic window. These advantages are expected to minimise the risk  of  toxicity  (especially  the  risk  of  hepatic  venooclusive  disease)  and  increase  the  probability  of achieving a complete myeloablation.

Normally,  considering  busulfan  as  a  drug  of  well-established  use  in  the  claimed  indication,  a pharmacokinetic  study  showing  the  bioequivalence  between  the  proposed  dosing  schedule  of Busilvex (0.8mg/kg) and the standard dose of oral busulfan could have been considered sufficient to substantiate the present application. As for the data provided by the Applicant the observed systemic exposure after Busilvex at 0.8 mg/kg seemed to be similar to that obtained after oral busulfan at 1.0 mg/kg. It seems also reasonable to think that a lower variability and a higher predictability of busulfan pharmacokinetics  are  normally  expected  after  i.v.  than  after  oral  administration.  The  additional pharmacokinetic comparison of i.v. Busilvex with data coming from different historical databases of oral  busulfan  pharmacokinetics  further  allow  concluding  a  similar  pharmacokinetic  profile  between both formulations with a reasonable level of confidence. Safety A prospective comparison of the efficacy and safety of Busilvex with oral busulfan have not been carried out. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, the nature of the dossier (new formulation of a wellknown substance) and the well-established use of oral busulfan as conditioning regimen for HSCT, allow  to  accept  a  proper  demonstration  of  the  pharmacokinetic  comparability  of  both  formulations altogether with the provided supportive efficacy as compatible with a positive benefit/risk assessment of the efficacy of Busilvex as a component of the Bu/Cy2 conditioning regimen pre-HSCT. As per CPMP request, the Applicant has provided additional information on the safety of Busilvex in the  target  population,  especially  concerning  with  the  potential  DMA-related  toxicity  (hepatic, neurologic and cardiac toxicity). A detailed review of the safety data of Busilvex does not reveal any specific toxicity pattern suspected to be associated with the use of DMA in the Busilvex formulation. Benefit/risk assessment Formally, oral busulfan has not this indication in most EU countries, although the Bu/Cy2 regimen is used worldwide. Early conditioning regimens were based on TBI, and currently modified TBI-based conditioning  regimens  are  in  some  cases  considered  as  the  first  choice  approach  prior  to  HSCT. However, the high technical requirements of the irradiation, the associated toxicity of TBI (sometimes not reversible), and the fact that these techniques are not universally available, prompted consideration for  effective  regimens  based  on  chemotherapy alone. In this regard, the Bu/Cy2 regimen is a  wellestablished  therapy  as  conditioning  regimen  for  HCST,  although  comparative  data  between  both approaches are inconclusive or even lacking for some haematological malignancies.

With the compiled data, the Applicant has to a reasonable extent shown that the chosen i.v. dose of 0.8 mg/kg gives an exposure comparable to that with the established oral dose of 1 mg/kg. The data also indicate  a  lower  variability  with  the  i.v.  formulation  than  with  PO  administration,  which  is  not unexpected.  Although  not  sufficiently  shown  to  e.g.  make  claims  in  the  product  information,  this might  indicate  that  the  risk  for  individual  very  low  or  very  high  exposures  is  decreased  with  i.v. administration. Thus, Busilvex (0.8 mg/kg) can be reasonably assumed to produce a similar systemic exposure to oral busulfan (1 mg/kg). The non-comparative clinical data provided by the Applicant do

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

not  suggest  any  specific  safety  concern  associated  to  either  the  intravenous  use  of  busulfan  nor  the substances contained in the Busilvex formulation (and more specifically the presence of DMA)

In conclusion, the data contained in this application show a positive benefit/risk ratio for Busilvex in the  following  indication:  Busilvex  is  indicated  as  conditioning  treatment  prior  to  haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation in adult patients when the combination of busulfan and cyclophosphamide (Bu/Cy2) is considered the best available option.

Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk profile of Busilvex was favourable for Busilvex followed by cyclophosphamide (BuCy2) as conditioning treatment prior to conventional haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in adult patients when the combination is considered the best available option
