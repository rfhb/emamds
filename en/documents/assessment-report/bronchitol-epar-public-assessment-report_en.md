## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Submission of the dossier

The  applicant,  Pharmaxis  Pharmaceuticals  Ltd.,  submitted  on  28  October  2009  an  application  for Marketing  Authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  for  Bronchitol,  through  the centralised  procedure  falling  within  the  Article  3(1)  and  point  4  of  Annex  of  Regulation  (EC)  No 726/2004.  The  eligibility  to  the  centralised  procedure  was  agreed  upon  by  the  EMA/CHMP  on 29 September 2008.

Bronchitol  was  designated  as  an  orphan  medicinal  product  EU/3/05/325  on  7  November  2005. Bronchitol  was  designated  as  an  orphan  medicinal  product  in  the  following  indication:  treatment  of cystic fibrosis.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## Cystic fibrosis

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease. The mean incidence is reported to be 1 in 20003000  live  Caucasian  births  (WHO  -  2004).  It  is  the  most  common  lethal  genetic  disorder  affecting Caucasian  populations.  Cystic  fibrosis  has  several  manifestations,  including  gastrointestinal,  though respiratory manifestations are the main and include bronchitis, bronchiolitis and bronchioectasis, which can lead to haemoptysis, pneumothorax and cor pulmonale. Lung disease is the most common (&gt;90%) cause of death in cystic fibrosis patients. The life span of patients with cystic fibrosis has increased in Europe and the median life expectancy for cystic fibrosis patients has been estimated in 2000-2003 as 40  years.  The  increase  in  average  age  of  death  leads  to  increased  proportion  of  adult  CF  patients, however, majority of patients are still in the paediatric population.

Cystic  fibrosis  is  caused  by  mutations  in  the  CFTR  (cystic  fibrosis  transmembrane  conductance regulator) gene. The primary function of the CFTR protein is as an ion channel that regulates liquid volume on epithelial surfaces through chloride secretion and inhibition of sodium absorption.

One hypothesis for the pathogenesis of lung disease in patients with cystic fibrosis is that a lack of regulation  of  sodium  absorption  and  chloride  secretion  reduces  the  water  content  of  airway  surface liquid, resulting in the accumulation of thick, tenacious mucus, and promotes the formation of adherent mucus plaques on airway surfaces. In cystic fibrosis patients, the ciliary system is unable to clear this mucus,  leading  to  chronic  inflammation  and  infection,  airway  damage,  and  ultimately  respiratory failure.

Pulmonary exacerbations are significant clinical events for patients with cystic fibrosis and lead to lung function decline. Pulmonary exacerbations are usually associated with a change in the bacterial density of  the  bacterial  flora  residing  in  the  airways.  Lung  infection  and  inflammation  in  cystic  fibrosis  are mainly treated with antibiotics. Other treatments include exercise and physical therapies, pancreatic enzymes replacement therapy, use of nutritional supplements, bronchodilators, mucolytics and antiinflammatory medicines, local hydration with inhaled moisture, and in severe cases lung transplantation.

Recombinant human DNase is currently registered as the mucolytic agent in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. RhDNase cleaves the DNA present in sputum/mucus and degrades the large amount of free DNA  that  accumulates  within  CF  mucus,  thereby  improving  the  viscoelastic  properties  of  airway secretions  and  promoting  airway  clearance.  RhDNase  is  recommended  by  current  guidelines  in  CF patients 6 years and older as it has been shown to improve lung function with a low risk of adverse events.

Nebulised hypertonic saline (HS) has been proposed as an agent that increases hydration of airway surface liquid  in  cystic  fibrosis  by  an  osmotic  gradient  to  improve  mucociliary  clearance  (MCC).  The quality  of  evidence  for  the  use  of  HS  in  patients  with  CF  is  limited  to  published  studies.  A  2005 Cochrane review of hypertonic saline found that overall lung function improved compared with placebo, but the improvement was not as great as that seen with dornase alfa.

Even though currently available therapies have prolonged life expectancy for cystic fibrosis patients, it is  still  a  progressive  disease  associated  with increased mortality and significantly decreased average

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

age of  death;  therefore  there  exists  an  unmet  medical  need  for  new  effective  treatments  for  cystic fibrosis.

## The product

Hyperosmolar agents such as inhaled mannitol are expected to facilitate clearance of mucus by ciliary and  cough  action  by  a  number  of  different  mechanisms.  Inhaled  mannitol  is  believed  to  create  an osmotic gradient that increases the amount of water in the airway lumen encouraging hydration and subsequent  restoration  of  the  periciliary  layer  (airway  surface  liquid).  This  is  expected  to  lead  to changes in surface properties, to improve ciliary function and mucus transportability and to increase mucociliary  clearance.  The  mucus  load  and  subsequent  inflammation  and  infection  might  therefore decrease, resulting in stabilisation of the cystic fibrosis patient's condition.

Mannitol  (D-Mannitol)  is  a  naturally  occurring  polyol  (sugar  alcohol).  It  is  used  intravenously  as  an osmotic agent for the treatment of cerebral oedema and renal failure and orally as a bowel preparation to  alleviate  constipation.  Mannitol  is  also  an  excipient  in  pharmaceutical  formulations,  and  a  food additive. Inhaled mannitol has been approved for bronchial hyperresponsiveness testing.

Bronchitol  has  been  developed  for  both  adults  and  children  with  CF  as  an  osmotic  stimulus  to  lung clearance  to  be  used  either  as  an  add-on  therapy  to  rhDNase  or  in  patients  intolerant  to,  or inadequately responsive to, rhDNase.

Bronchitol  is  an  encapsulated  powder  for  inhalation.  The  product  consists  of  hard  gelatine  capsules containing 40 mg of respirable mannitol powder delivered to the patient via a dry powder inhaler, to be provided in the package of Bronchitol.

The original indication claimed by the applicant was:

-  'Bronchitol is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in both paediatric and adult population 6 years and above as either an add-on therapy to rhDNase or in patients intolerant to, or inadequately responsive to rhDNase.'

During the evaluation procedure the applicant has modified this indication to exclude those below 18 years of age.

The posology proposed by the applicant is 400 mg twice a day, which requires inhalation of the content of  10  capsules  of  40  mg  via  the  inhaler  device  twice  a  day.  Before  commencing  treatment  with Bronchitol,  all  patients  during  administration  of  their  initiation  dose  are  required  to  be  assessed  for bronchial  hyperresponsiveness  to  inhaled  mannitol,  which  is  listed  as  a  contraindication  in  the proposed SPC.

Initiation of Bronchitol treatment (at dose 400 mg) is proposed to be done under the supervision and monitoring of an experienced physician or another appropriately trained health professional, equipped to  monitor  oxygen  saturation  and  able  to  perform  spirometry  and  manage  acute  bronchospasm.  A bronchodilator is proposed to be administered 5-15 minutes before Bronchitol is used.

## Type of Application and aspects on development

This is a complete independent application. The legal basis of the application refers to Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC.

The applicant  requested  an  accelerated  assessment  for  the  application.  However,  the  CHMP  did  not accept  this  request  as  it  could  not  be  assumed  that  the  product  would  be  of  major  public  health interest and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. It was noted that such claim

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

would  require  substantial  data  to  assess  the  impact  on  reduced  morbidity  and  prolonged  life expectancy  data,  given  the  closeness  of  the  therapeutic  principle  of  inhaled  mannitol  to  the  one  of available therapies. Based on the available evidence inhaled mannitol was considered not to address a major  unmet  need  but  instead  to  offer  an  alternative  to  adjunctive  therapies  used  to  support  the therapeutic  algorithm  with  the  aim  of  dislodging  sputum  and  encouraging  its  expectoration.  The claimed innovator concept was thus not supported by the Committee. Furthermore, it was considered that a new mode and method of administration with a dry powder inhaler and small portable device that would improve compliance could not be recognised to fulfil such criterion.

Bronchitol, for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, has been designated as an orphan medicinal product.

For  the  development  of  products  for  cystic  fibrosis  a  specific  guideline  has  been  developed  by  the CHMP  (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/9147/2008)  and  is  applicable  also  to  the  development  programme  of Bronchitol.

The applicant had obtained protocol assistance, during which it was advised that:

-  A sub-therapeutic dose of mannitol would be acceptable as a control in the Phase 3 study.
-  The trial design initially proposed by the applicant would not be adequate to evaluate efficacy of mannitol as both first line and add on therapy (to rhDNAse) in CF because rhDNAse treated and rhDNAse naïve patients are unlikely to be comparable in terms of severity of disease.
-  From the data presented during scientific advice procedure, the indication for an add-on to existing therapy appears to be the most appropriate indication.
-  Revisions to the protocol, as proposed by the applicant, are acceptable. However, it was noted that an add-on design (or alternatively a non-inferiority/superiority design against rhDNAse for a first line  indication)  is  recommended  for  the  clinical  development.  It  was  noted  that  the  trial  design might benefit from small-scale short-term trials first to determine if the chosen order of mannitol, postural drainage and bronchodilator is optimal for this drug.
-  The FEV1 would be a suitable primary efficacy endpoint in the pivotal Phase 3 studies.

In general the applicant has complied with the Protocol Assistance.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

In  general,  satisfactory  chemical  and  pharmaceutical  documentation  have  been  submitted  for  the marketing authorisation. There are no major deviations from EU and ICH requirements.

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of the medicinal product is acceptable. There were no quality outstanding issues on the quality  of  the  active  substance  at  the  time  of  Opinion.  However  one  non-major  issue  remains unresolved  regarding  the  quality  of  the  finished  medicinal  product:  the  characterisation  of  the preservative efficacy of mannitol against species such as Burkholdaria cepacia, Aspergillus fumigatus was  not  performed.  These  infective  agents  are  commonly  reported  as  pathogenic  contaminants  in cystic fibrosis and therefore this issue required investigation.

## 2.2.6. Recommendation(s) for future quality development

Not applicable.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The non-clinical data consists of non-clinical studies sponsored by the applicant and published data. Since  mannitol  is  a  known  active  substance,  mainly  relevant  published  data  have  been  submitted, supplemented with a bridging programme of studies conducted to support its use by the inhalation route. The additional studies comprised of single and repeated dose toxicity, including toxicokinetics, and local tolerance studies, which all were reported to be GLP compliant.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

Data from the literature indicate that the primary pharmacodynamic actions of inhaled mannitol relate to its osmotic effect on airway secretions. In the isolated ferret trachea 1 , a solution of 15 g/dl mannitol increased  mucin  and  lysozyme  secretion.  Mannitol  appeared  to  induce  mucin  secretion  to  a  greater extent  than  saline  solution  with  similar  osmolarity,  although  this  was  not  statistically  significant. Mannitol  also  caused  a  dose-dependent  increase  in  respiratory  tract  fluid  output  in  anaesthetised beagle dogs 2 . Overall, both models showed that mucus secretion is markedly stimulated in response to hyperosmolarity and support the hypothesis that Inhaled mannitol causes an osmotic gradient in the airway leading to an increase in secretion of water into the airway lumen, which rehydrates the mucus. This is expected to result in a change in mucus rheology, promoting mucociliary clearance.

## Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

1 Kishioka C, Okamoto K, Kim J-S, Rubin BK. Hyperosmolar solutions stimulate mucus secretion in the ferret trachea. Chest, July 2003;124:306-313

2 Chen BT, Yeates DB. Ion transport and regulation of respiratory tract fluid output in dogs. J Appl Physio, 2001;90:821831

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Inhaled d-mannitol aerosol increases osmolarity, which leads to the release of inflammatory mediators such  as  histamine,  leukotrienes  and  prostanoids  from  airway  and  inflammatory  cells,  which  in  turn results in bronchoconstriction and airway narrowing. This is the pharmacological activity of mannitol as the  challenge  agent.  It  is  also  relevant  for  patients  receiving  inhaled  mannitol,  therefore  pertinent information has been included in the proposed SPC.

Taking into account the clinical experience with mannitol as a challenge agent, no further secondary pharmacodynamic studies are required.

## Safety pharmacology programme

Safety pharmacology aspects have been investigated in repeat-dose toxicology studies. No evidence of respiratory or cardiovascular treatment-related effects was seen in the mannitol inhalation repeat-dose toxicology studies conducted. Cardiovascular and respiratory functions were monitored during the dog 2-week inhalation toxicity study and no changes in cardiovascular or respiratory functions were seen at doses up to 789 mg/kg/day. In the repeat-dose toxicology studies, inhalation of mannitol at up to 9 (rats)  and  54  (in  dogs)  times  the  maximum  recommended  human  dose  did  not  cause  any  notable effects on the central nervous system. In addition, no reports of altered respiratory, cardiovascular or CNS  functions  were  found  despite  widespread  human  and  animal  exposure  to  mannitol,  except  at systemic doses that are in excess of the recommended  dose  proposed in this application (800 mg/day). Therefore, further safety pharmacology studies are not considered required.

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Non clinical studies on pharmacodynamic interactions have not been performed, which can be accepted in  the  light  of  available  clinical  and  literature  data  and  the  wide  experience  in  administration  of mannitol.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics

No  specific  pharmacokinetic  studies  by  the  inhalation route were  conducted  but  toxicokinetic measurements were included for serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in the toxicity studies in the dog and for BAL fluid in two studies in the rat, which are discussed under Toxicology below. The absence  of  specific  non  clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  is  acceptable.  Additional  data  from  the literature are presented in this section below.

Orally, mannitol is slowly and poorly absorbed, with a bioavailability of 17-20% and it exerts a laxative effect because of its osmotic effects. In addition, the literature provides some evidence that mannitol can  be  absorbed  systemically  from  the  lungs.  Mannitol  administered  by  inhalation  or  intratracheal administration in mice, rats and rabbits was absorbed relatively rapidly from the lung, in a manner suggesting first-order kinetics with a half-life of 26.5 minutes in the rat. Mannitol does not cross the blood-brain barrier.

A percentage of systemically absorbed mannitol undergoes hepatic metabolism to glycogen and carbon dioxide and the compound is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine or faeces. A minor proportion might be excreted as carbon dioxide in the expired air following complete metabolism by dehydrogenation to fructose and through the glycolytic pathway. No toxic metabolites are found and there is no evidence of accumulation.

Excretion  following  intravenous  administration  is  mainly  as  unchanged  mannitol  via  the  urine;  this would also apply to mannitol systemically absorbed following inhalation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is expected that a significant proportion of mannitol might be swallowed by patients using Inhaled mannitol and that it will be excreted unchanged in the faeces.

## 2.3.4. Toxicology

A single-dose study in rats and repeat-dose studies in rats and dogs were performed to examine the local respiratory tract tolerance and the systemic effects of inhaled mannitol. Ocular toxicity has been assessed in two studies; a rabbit eye irritation study and a bovine corneal opacity and permeability study.

Literature references were  reviewed  for repeat-dose  toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity  and reproduction toxicity data.

## Single dose toxicity

One  single  dose  toxicity  study  by  inhalation  administration  was  conducted  in  rats  where  male  and female rats (5 per group) received 17.6, 80 or 98.1 mg/kg mannitol via inhalation. Slight reduction in body weight gain  at  17.6  and  80 mg/kg  dose  and  statistically  significant  at  98.1 mg/kg,  as  well  as slight reduction in food consumption at 98.1 mg/kg dose was observed in male rats. In females body weight loss 1 day after dosing at 80 and 98.1 mg/kg was noted. Differences in body weight gain were explained by not balanced age of animals in the different groups. At post mortem, the weights of lungs and bronchi of the treated male animals were lower than those of the controls, achieving statistical significance  in  the  80  and  98.1 mg/kg  groups.  The  findings  were  not  consistent  between  genders. Some microscopic  findings  including  arterial  mural  mineralization  in  lungs  and  bronchi,  submucosal inflammatory cells in nasal turbinates and loss of cilia in trachea were noted primarily in high dosed animals.  Study  results  do  not  raise  any  serious  toxicological  concerns.    A  No  Adverse  Effect  Level (NOAEL) from this study was defined by the applicant as 98.1 mg/kg/day, which is 7 times higher than the anticipated dose in humans.

Information about single dose toxicity in mannitol via other administration routes is available in the literature.

A  single-dose  toxicity  study 3   in  6-week  old  F344/N  rats  (50)  and  B6C3F1  mice  (50)  has  been conducted. On day one, each group of 10 (5F, 5M) was offered, ad libitum in their water, either 6,000, 12,500, 25,000, 50,000, or 100,000 ppm of mannitol. They were observed twice daily for survival and other  physical  signs  up  to  day  16.  All  animals  survived,  and  no  compound-related  effects  were observed.

According  to  published  data 4 mannitol  has  low  acute  toxicity  by  the  oral,  intravenous  (IV)  or intraperitoneal (IP) routes:

| LD 50 Rat oral:   | 13.5 g/kg   |
|-------------------|-------------|
| LD 50 Rat IV:     | 9.69 g/kg   |
| LD 50 Mouse oral: | 22 g/kg     |
| LD 50 Mouse IP:   | 14 g/kg     |
| LD 50 Mouse IV:   | 7.47 g/kg   |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Repeat dose toxicity

2-week repeat dose inhalation toxicity studies in rats and dogs, 7-day and 13-week inhalation toxicity studies in rats and a 26-week inhalation toxicity study in beagle dogs have been conducted.

Two-week  repeat-dose  inhalation  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  dogs  were  conducted  and  considered pivotal: 13-week inhalation toxicity studies in rats and a 26-week inhalation toxicity study in beagle dogs. The choice of the beagle dog for the pivotal 26-week study was justified on the basis of greater exposure achieved in the respiratory tract in this species. The dog also showed signs indicative of a more relevant pharmacodynamic effect, in the form of pulmonary oedema and frothing in the trachea.

The  repeat-dose  inhalation  studies  indicated  no  local  toxicity  to  the  respiratory  tract,  nor  was  any evidence of systemic toxicity noted. Mannitol by inhalation was generally well tolerated in rats for 13 weeks under a regimen of dosing at up to 210 mg/kg/day for 180 minutes daily and in dogs at doses up to 713 mg/kg/day for two 1-hour periods per day. Lymphocytosis was seen in the 2-week and 13week rat studies and plasmacytosis was also seen in the 13-week rat study. In the 2-week rat study, some findings were also observed in tissues other than the respiratory tract in the high-dose animals, such as increased incidence of inflammatory cells in the myocardium and epididymides, and cortical renal tubular basophilia.

A minor increase in lung weight was evident at the end of the 2-week dog study and was thought to reflect  the  pharmacological  response  to  the  high  mannitol  load  in  the  lungs  and  the  time  of  death relative  to  the  end  of  dosing.  (Note:  In  contrast  to  all  other  studies  reported,  the  dogs  were  killed immediately  after  exposure  to  assess  the  peak  lung  mannitol  burden  in  this  study).  No  similar treatment-related effects were seen in the 26-week dog study where the dogs were killed 20-24 hours after the last exposure when any pharmacological effects of mannitol had disappeared.

Also in the 13-week rat study, there was a significant increase in both the percentage and absolute number of natural killer cells in the 210 mg/kg group and the value remained increased at the end of the 4-week recovery period. There were no other notable effects on lymphocyte subpopulations, nor any evidence of immunotoxicity; the persisting slight increase in natural killer cells is not considered to indicate any risk for clinical use.

In dogs, BAL cell count investigations at 26 weeks revealed an increase in absolute white cell counts for mannitol-treated animals but this did not persist into the recovery period. This finding is consistent with the observations made following the use of mannitol as a diagnostic agent for hyper-reactivity of the lungs and is not considered to represent a significant toxic risk. Coughing and enlarged local lymph nodes were found but did not persist during the recovery period.

In rats a slight increase in NK cells was seen however the elevated levels were within historic control ranges for the laboratory. In addition there was no evidence of immunotoxicity in the dogs or humans. There were no treatment-related effects on organ weights and there were no necropsy or histology findings that could be attributed to administration of mannitol.

Published data on repeat-dose toxicity from mice, rats and monkeys did not show any toxicologically relevant signs of toxicity associated with the systemic administration of mannitol.

## Genotoxicity

Scientific literature was reviewed for genotoxicity data. There was no evidence of genotoxicity on the part of mannitol in any of the available studies, which include reports on Bacterial Reverse Mutagenesis Test, Mouse Lymphoma TK assay, Sister Chromatid Exchange and Chromosome Aberration test, Mouse Micronucleus Bone Marrow and Peripheral Blood Study, Drosophila Sex-Linked Recessive Lethal Study,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In vivo Cytogenetics Chromosome Aberration study and others. On the basis of the published studies and  the  fact  that  mannitol  is  an  approved  pharmaceutical  excipient,  there  are  no  concerns  over genotoxicity.

## Carcinogenicity

## Long term studies

A long-term (104-107 weeks) toxicity and carcinogenicity study in the Wistar rat has been reported in the literature. Male and female rats were fed mannitol at doses of 4.4 and 5.2 g/kg respectively (10% in the diet). No toxicologically significant events or alteration in tumour incidence was seen 5 .

In another study 6  F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were fed mannitol at doses of 25,000 and 50,000 ppm (5% limit dose) for 103 weeks. Mannitol was not carcinogenic in these studies. Mild nephrosis (focal vacuolisation  of  renal  tubular  epithelium)  was  noted  in  mice  and  a  treatment  related,  but  not  dose related,  increased  incidence  of  dilatation  of  the  gastric  fundal  gland  was  detected  in  the  low-  and high-dose female rats. Retinopathy and cataracts occurred at increased incidences.

## Medium and short term studies

A carcinogenicity study in transgenic animals is reported in the literature. The study used p53-deficient mice that were fed mannitol at a dose of 5% in food for a period of 26 weeks. At the end of the study, mannitol was classified as non-carcinogenic 7 . However, it should be noted that also the positive control did not induce any tumours in this study.

Embryonic  turkey  and  quail  livers  were  examined  after  exposure  to  known  non-carcinogens  and carcinogens.  The  known  carcinogen  diethylnitrosamine  induced  preneoplastic  liver  lesions,  whereas mannitol  caused  no  histological  changes  in  the  embryonic  livers 8 .  The  authors  noted  that  these findings correlate with traditional long-term rodent bioassays.

There was no evidence of carcinogenicity of mannitol in the presented studies. On the basis of this and the  fact  that  mannitol  is  an  approved  pharmaceutical  excipient,  there  are  no  concerns  over carcinogenicity.  Furthermore,  there  were  no  proliferative  lesions  seen  in  the  inhalation  studies conducted  on  behalf  of  the  applicant  and  there  is  no  reason  to  assume  that  mannitol  will  be carcinogenic by the inhalation route.

## Reproduction Toxicity

Literature  data  on  the  reproductive  toxicity  of  mannitol  have  been  adduced  to  demonstrate  the absence of effects on fertility, embryo-foetal development and pre- and post-natal development. While the data were derived from different dosing routes and the study designs were not in accordance with current  guidelines,  nonetheless,  the  data  indicate  that  there  is  no  serious  risk  to  reproduction associated with mannitol. In some investigations, mannitol even had been used as a negative control because of its  lack  of  teratogenicity.  It  is  also  accepted  as  an  excipient  for  use  by  the  intravenous route. The available data do not preclude the use of inhaled mannitol during pregnancy.

Analytical methods for the quantification of mannitol in dog serum and BAL fluid were developed and validated satisfactorily.

An issue of potential contamination of some pre-trial and control toxicokinetics samples in the 2-week dog study was identified. Even though no clear explanation for this finding was identified, based on consistency of results it is accepted that it is possible to draw valid conclusions from the study. It is also accepted that it is unlikely that an explanation can be provided for this finding.

BAL  samples  were  obtained  for  the  rat  investigative  study  for  3  animals  per  sex  per  group.  BAL analysis  indicated  that  concentrations  were  in  the  range  12600-60100 ng  mannitol/mL  for  the low-dose  (592-706 mg/kg/day)  group  and  10400-58900 ng  mannitol/mL  for  the  high-dose  (8781347 mg/kg/day) group.  There  was  large  variability  noted  in  mannitol  levels  between  animals  from both groups, but animals had clearly been exposed to mannitol.

In the 13-week repeat-dose study in rats, BAL was performed on satellite animals on day 1 and during weeks 7 and 13 and the resulting fluid assayed for mannitol content. The applicant reports that the data showed clear and dose-dependent levels of mannitol in the BAL fluid and thus provides 'proof of exposure' for the study.

Toxicokinetic analysis was performed in the investigative study in dogs on 3 sampling occasions (days 1, 2 and 5). Serum concentration levels demonstrated a dose-related increase with maximum levels being reached within 0.5-1 hour post-dose. Pre-dose samples taken on days 2 and 5 of study indicated that there were very low residual levels of mannitol present.

Bioanalysis investigations on day 1 and during weeks 13 and 26 of 26-week repeat-dose study in dogs revealed that all low- and high-dose group animals had been exposed to mannitol as evinced by the presence  of  test  item  in  serum.  The  serum  concentrations  showed  a  dose-related  increase  with maximum mean concentrations of approximately 280,000 ng/ml being reached within 1 hour post dose for  each  daily  dose  session.  There  were  no  substantive  gender  differences  in  serum  mannitol concentrations and there was no evidence of accumulation. Lung lavage data demonstrated there was a very low level of mannitol in the lungs 20-24 hours after the final exposure indicating rapid clearance

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

from the lungs. Overall, the toxicokinetic serum data clearly demonstrated good exposure of low- and high-dose animals to mannitol.

In  the  rat  investigative  study,  BAL  analysis  indicated  that  concentrations  were  in  the  range  1260060100 ng mannitol/mL for the low-dose (592-706 mg/kg/day) group and 10400-58900 ng mannitol/mL for the high-dose (878-1347 mg/kg/day) group. For the 13-week repeat-dose study in rats,  the  applicant  reports  that  the  data  showed clear and dose-dependent levels of mannitol in the BAL fluid and thus provides 'proof of exposure' for the study.

In the 2- and 26-week repeat-dose toxicity studies in dogs, it was noted that all dosed animals had been exposed to test item as evidenced by the presence of mannitol in serum and BAL washes. The serum concentrations detected showed a dose-related increase with maximum mean concentrations being reached within 1 hour post-dose for each of the two daily dosing sessions. Lung lavage data demonstrated  that  there  was  a  very  low  level  of  mannitol  in  the  lungs  20-24  hours  after  the  final exposure, indicating rapid clearance from the lungs. The increases in Cmax and AUC values (0-t and 0inf)  for  the  high-dosed  animals  compared  to  intermediate-dosed  animals  were  greater  than  the corresponding increase in dose (165 to 750 mg/kg/day)  indicating saturation of elimination mechanisms and non-linear kinetics at doses above 165 mg/kg/day.

## Local Tolerance

Local  tolerance  was  investigated  in  a  bovine  corneal  opacity  and  permeability  assay  and  an  eye irritation study in the rabbit, to cover the possibility of accidental delivery of the powder to the eyes.

In a bovine corneal opacity and permeability assay corneal opacity and permeability were assessed and the scores combined to give an in vitro score that was assessed against a positive control (imidazole) and a saline negative control group. Mannitol, as a 20%w/w solution, was classified as negative in this assay and thus considered not a potential eye irritant.

In an eye irritation study performed three New Zealand White strain rabbits were given a single ocular dose of 78 mg (0.1 ml) of mannitol and then observed for reactions to instillation during a period of four days. Initial instillation induced a slight pain response and a minimal response (injection of the conjunctival blood vessels) in all animals one hour after dosing. This sign persisted overnight in two rabbits but all rabbits reverted to normal within 48 hours. Mannitol was assessed as 'not irritating to the eyes'.

There was no evidence of local irritation in either the respiratory tract in the repeat-dose studies or in the bovine corneal assay and the eye irritation study in the rabbit.

## Other toxicity studies

The  identified  impurities  are  primarily  sorbitol,  maltitol  and  isomaltitol,  which  all  are  approved sweeteners. The levels specified for impurities have been adequately justified and additional toxicity studies are not considered necessary.

Assessment for the potential for immunotoxicity was undertaken by the applicant and was based on the following studies: 26-week inhalation toxicity study in dogs with a 4-week recovery period and also in the 13-week rat study. The results of the flow cytometry examinations do not suggest any effects of treatment, nor were there any effects on the bone marrow that would indicate immunotoxicity. It is concluded that there is no need for additional, specialised studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The  active  substance  is  a  natural  substance,  the  use  of  which  will  not  alter  the  concentration  or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, mannitol is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The applicant's use of published data is deemed adequate in this case to support the pharmacodynamic action of the product, which is considered to be via hydration of the pulmonary secretions. The data cited support the conclusion that mannitol appears to induce mucin secretion to a greater extent than saline solution with similar osmolarity, although this difference was not statistically significant. Mucus secretion is markedly stimulated in response to hyperosmolarity.

Published data on repeat-dose toxicity from rats, mice and monkeys did not show any toxicologically-relevant signs of toxicity associated with the systemic administration of mannitol.

The bridging programme of toxicity studies conducted by the applicant to supplement the previously available data on other dosing routes is in line with the CHMP advice and is considered acceptable to support a marketing authorisation.  The study programme is considered adequate.

Mannitol by inhalation was generally well tolerated in rats for 13 weeks under a regimen of dosing at doses up to 210 mg/kg/day for 180 minutes daily and in dogs at doses up to 713 mg/kg/day for two 1hour periods per day, although these were not no-effect doses.

In dogs, BAL cell count investigations at 26 weeks revealed an increase in absolute white cell counts for mannitol-treated animals but this did not persist into the recovery period.  This finding is consistent with the observations made following the use of mannitol as a diagnostic agent and is not considered to represent a significant toxic risk. Coughing and enlarged local lymph nodes were found but did not persist during the recovery period.

Most  findings  could  be  related  to  the  inhalation  of  a  large  particulate  load  and  were  generally reversible.  There was no specific target-organ or delayed toxicity in either species.

There  was  an  issue  with  what  was  judged  to  be  contamination  of  some  pretrial  and  control toxicokinetics samples in the 2-week dog study.  There is no clear explanation for this finding but it is accepted  that  it  is  possible  to  draw  valid  conclusions  from  the  study.    It  is  also  accepted  that  it  is unlikely that a clear explanation can be provided for this finding.

Literature data on the reproductive toxicity of mannitol have been adduced to demonstrate its absence of effects on fertility, embryo-fetal development and pre- and post-natal development.  While the data were derived from different dosing routes and the study designs were not in accordance with current guidelines, nonetheless, the data indicate that there is no risk to reproduction with mannitol.  In some instances, mannitol had been used as a negative control because of its lack of teratogenicity.  It is also accepted as an excipient for use by the intravenous route.

There are no issues in respect of local tolerance, genotoxicity or carcinogenicity.

## 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The  applicant  has  conducted  an  acceptable  non-clinical  bridging  programme  in  line  with  the  advice given by the CHMP in order to supplement the published data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pharmacodynamic action of the product is considered to be via hydration of the pulmonary secretions. Inhaled mannitol was generally well tolerated; most findings could be related to the inhalation of a large  particulate  load  and  were  generally  reversible.  There  was  no  specific  target-organ  or  delayed toxicity of any concern in either species.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## 2.4.1. Introduction

The clinical development programme of inhaled mannitol consisted or several studies, which include 5 phase I studies, 3 phase II studies and 2 phase III studies. Two additional phase III studies in another indication provide supplementary information.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

The CHMP requested a GCP inspection of the pivotal clinical study DPM-CF-301. The GCP inspection was carried out at one investigator site in the United Kingdom (dates of inspection: 2nd March - 5th March  2010)  and  at  one  investigator  site  in  Ireland  (dates  of  inspection:  24th  February  -  26th February  2010).  Overall,  compliance  with  ICH  GCP  and  European  and  National  legislation  was considered satisfactory at both sites and the data presented in the application appear to be acceptable. None of the inspection findings and observations were thought to have critical consequences for the overall reliability of data.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

Mannitol is a known substance, since it has been used for decades as a pharmaceutical excipient and therapeutic  agent,  both  orally  and  intravenously.  It  has  been  approved  also  as  a  diagnostic pharmaceutical product for the inhalation route. This data are sufficient for not conducting full formal PK characterisation of the compound.

The applicant has submitted two studies which generated pharmacokinetic data regarding the use of inhaled  mannitol  relevant  to  its  use  in  cystic  fibrosis.  These  studies,  DPM-PK-101  (in  healthy volunteers)  and  DPM-PK-102  (in  patients  with  cystic  fibrosis)  used  inhaled  mannitol  in  doses representative of those proposed for use in the clinical setting.

Study DPM-PK-101, a PK and bioavailability study of mannitol in healthy subjects, had an open-label, randomised,  three-way  crossover  design,  in  which  each  subject  received  mannitol  powder  as inhalation, orally and intravenously. All subjects were screened by receiving 635 mg mannitol powder

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

for inhalation (maximum dose administered clinically during the course of a negative challenge test) as the mannitol challenge and subjects who had a negative test result and satisfied all other eligibility criteria were assigned to receive the three study treatments in random order. There was a minimum 7 day wash-out period between Screening and Visit 1, and between study drug administrations. Blood samples  for  the  determination  of  mannitol  in  serum  were  started  at  12  hours  before  treatment. Samples were collected at -12 and -0.5 hr pre-dose and at 5, 10, 20, 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-dose. The trial population consisted of healthy male volunteers, 18-65 years of age with  no  history  of  asthma  or  other  chronic  diseases  which  could  compromise  the  airways  or  gut absorption.  According  to  the  protocol  18  subjects  would  enter  the  study  to  allow  15  subjects  to complete treatment. No subjects withdrew from the trial during the treatment period. The data from all subjects were analysed for pharmacokinetics and safety.

Study  DPM-PK-101  results,  presented  below,  showed  only  relatively  minor  differences  in  dosenormalised pharmacokinetic characteristics of  a  635 mg  inhaled,  a  500 mg  oral  and  500 mg intravenous dose of mannitol.

Study DPM-PK-102, a PK study of inhaled mannitol after single and multiple dosing in CF patients, was a  multiple-centre,  open-label  study,  in  which  adult  and  paediatric  cystic  fibrosis  patients  received

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mannitol powder for inhalation using a dry powder inhaler. Initially, as a part of the screening process, all  patients  were  to  receive  400  mg  mannitol  powder  for  inhalation  as  the  Mannitol  Tolerance  Test (MTT). Patients who had a negative test result for airway hyperresponsiveness and satisfied all other eligibility criteria were entered into the study to receive the study treatment. The treatment phase of the  study  lasted  for  7  days.  A  single  dose  of  400 mg  of  inhaled  mannitol  was  administered  on  the morning of Day 1 and then twice daily from Day 2 to 6 and the last multiple dose on the morning of Day 7. During the treatment period, patients attended the study centre for at least two visits. Patients were confined to the study centre for at least 12 hours on Days 1 and 7 for intensive blood sampling, while additional PK samples were taken on the mornings of Days 2 and 8 (24 hours post-dose). The trial population consisted of adult (18+ years) and adolescent (12-17 years) cystic fibrosis patients. 18 patients (6 adult, 6 adolescent and 6 paediatric) were planned, while 9 (6 adults, 3 adolescents) were actually dosed and analysed.

Study DPM-PK-102 results, presented below, showed that pharmacokinetic characteristics of a single dose of inhaled mannitol in cystic fibrosis patients did not show significant differences  from healthy volunteers, although the applied dose was lower (635 mg in healthy volunteers and 400 mg in cystic fibrosis patients). The pharmacokinetic properties in adults and adolescents were comparable.

## Absorption

The systemic exposure to mannitol with the inhaled powder was investigated in healthy volunteers as well as in patients with cystic fibrosis. The absorbed fraction after inhalation (approximately 50-60 %) in healthy volunteers is comparable to that observed with the oral route.

Based on the available data, no unexpected accumulation has been observed in cystic fibrosis patients.

## Distribution

Since the low level of accumulation noted in the DPM-PK-102 is not significant, and there is no other evidence of accumulation in the body, distribution of inhaled mannitol was not specifically investigated in human PK studies. From literature data, oral mannitol distributes almost entirely in the extracellular fluid.

## Elimination

Since the low level of accumulation noted in the DPM-PK-102 is not significant, and there is no other evidence of accumulation in the body, the metabolic pathway of inhaled mannitol was not specifically

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

investigated in human PK studies. From literature data, oral mannitol is mainly eliminated unchanged in the urine.

## Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Different  doses  of  mannitol  have  been  investigated  by  the  applicant  in  a  Phase  2  trial  (see  Dose response study below).

## Special populations

Very limited data are available in paediatric patients (3 adolescent subjects) and no investigation was carried  out  in  younger  children.  Based  on  this  data  no  sound  conclusions  can  be  drawn  on  the pharmacokinetics in the paediatric population.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

PK  interaction  studies  have  not  been  performed  by  the  applicant,  justified  by  the  nature  and endogenous presence of mannitol.

## Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

Studies using human biomaterials have not been performed since they are deemed not relevant to the formulation.

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

Pharmacodynamic properties have been addressed with references to published literature.

## Mechanism of action

Inhaled mannitol has two mechanisms of action that are particularly relevant to this application - as a hyperosmolar  agent  creating  a  osmotic  gradient  in  the  airways  and  as  an  agent  which  can  induce bronchospasm.

Mannitol's intended mechanism of action is related to its potential as a hyperosmolar agent to create an osmotic gradient in airways that facilitates an efflux of water into the airway lumen. This efflux of water is thought to increase the water content in the ASL, and thus decrease viscosity of sputum to promote the clearance of the mucus by cilia.

Induction of bronchospasm is the opposite pharmacodynamic effect to that intended for patients with CF (an increase in FEV1). Published data indicate that inhaled mannitol increases the osmolarity in the airways which results in a release of different bronchoconstriction mediators from inflammatory cells within the airways.

Inhaled mannitol is licensed in the EU to identify bronchial responsiveness in subjects with a baseline FEV1 of &gt;70% predicted. Ascending doses are given from 5 mg up to a maximum cumulative dose of 635 mg. To circumvent the difficulty of bronchospasm induction, patients with asthma are excluded from the requested indication and patients are required to undergo an initial challenge with inhaled mannitol with close supervision of airway function. Before treating with mannitol, patients are also premedicated with an inhaled beta agonist. Despite excluding patients with a history of asthma and pre-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

medicating with an inhaled beta agonist, one published trial in CF found that 6 of 49 subjects still had a fall in FEV1 of &gt;15% (mean 17%) with a mean provocative dose of mannitol of 270 mg 9 .

## Primary and secondary pharmacology

Results of a published study 10 showed that neither mannitol nor hypertonic saline (HS), combined with coughing,  improved  bronchial  mucus  clearance  during  intervention  period,  but  after  90  minutes  the total clearance was significantly higher for both mannitol and HS compared to control treatments. The mean clearance at the end of the study (i.e. 120 minutes) was 28% and 19% for the mannitol and empty capsule plus coughing, respectively (p &lt; 0.01). The mean clearance was 31% and 21% for HS and physiological saline plus coughing, respectively (p &lt; 0.01). The authors concluded that dry powder mannitol is a potential mucoactive agent in CF patients.

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The  two  studies  presented  in  this  submission  show  that  inhaled  mannitol  presents  very  similar pharmacokinetic properties to those seen with a similar oral dose and intravenous delivery systems. No significant  differences  were  seen  in  healthy  volunteers.  Of  importance  the  second  study  establishes that  at  the  proposed  dose  of  circa  400 mg  cystic  fibrosis  patients  present  similar  PK  characteristics seen with healthy volunteers.

Published data indicate that inhaled mannitol increases the osmolarity in the airways which results in a release  of  different  bronchoconstriction  mediators  from  inflammatory  cells  within  the  airways. Therefore, a mannitol tolerance test (MTT) is required to exclude patients with bronchial hyperreactivity from the treatment with inhaled mannitol. This requirement is stated as a prerequisite measure  in  the  SPC  proposed  by  the  applicant.  A  positive  test  to  mannitol  is  stated  as  a contraindication  of  the  product.  The  MTT  criteria  proposed  in  the  SPC  of  Inhaled  mannitol  are  in accordance with the MTT criteria adopted for currently approved inhaled mannitol for diagnostic use i.e.  threshold  of  fall  in  FEV 1 i.e.  20%  from  baseline  for  considering  the  MTT  as  positive.  This corresponds to the criteria applied in Phase 3 studies. Of note, a fall of 20% in FEV1 is considerably greater than the mean benefit in FEV1 as demonstrated in the Phase 3 trials.

Hyper-responsiveness  was  not  controlled  further  during  the  course  of  the  clinical  studies  that  were submitted and several patients withdrew with symptoms that might have been induced by mannitol. It is not clear if the timing of the pre-medication with an inhaled beta agonist adequately reversed the bronchoconstrictor  effect  of  mannitol  over  the  whole  treatment  course.  Thus  mannitol  induced bronchoconstriction may have been more marked than at the time of spirometry. Whether long term treatment with mannitol would have any impact on bronchial reactivity in cystic fibrosis patients is not documented. Such a survey should be part of the safety assessment for the chronic use of inhaled mannitol.

In  the  clinical  studies  submitted  by  the  applicant,  the  rate  of  positive  mannitol  tolerance  test  at screening varied from 8 % to 30 % of the recruited patients. Patients with severe illness were excluded and were not tested. It is foreseen that in clinical practice mannitol treatment would be contraindicated in a significant proportion of patients. Patients who showed less than a 20% fall in FEV1 on screening may show a greater fall in FEV1 during an exacerbation and this possibility has not been investigated. Adverse  events  during  the  trial  and  during  12  month's  open  label  use  suggest  that  symptoms

attributable  to  pharyngeal  and  bronchial irritation  may  be  common.  It  is  possible  that  the  thorough pre-treatment bronchoprovocation screening and pre-medication with a bronchodilator might not be carried out as thoroughly in clinical practice as they were in the clinical trial.

The  applicant  has  claimed  a  sustained  effect  compared  to  hypertonic  saline,  but  this  claim  is  not supported with adequate data.

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

PK  characteristics  of  inhaled  mannitol  in  CF  patients  are  in  line  with  PK  characteristics  in  healthy volunteers and other routes of administration (oral and intravenous).

References  to  published  literature  justify  the  absence  of  pharmacodynamic  studies  with  inhaled mannitol.

The impact of long term treatment with mannitol on bronchial hyperresponsiveness is not documented in  the  dossier and therefore remains unclear. This is especially important for clinical practice, where pre-treatment bronchoprovocation screening and pre-medication with a bronchodilator might not be carried out as thoroughly as in clinical trials.

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

The main studies for clinical efficacy evaluation are a dose response phase II study DPM-CF-202, a phase II study in children DPM-CF-203, a phase II study DPM-CF-201 and the pivotal phase III studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302.

## 2.5.1. Dose response study

## Study DPM-CF-202: A Phase IIa Randomised, Open Label, Dose Response Study to Determine the Optimum Dose of Dry Powder Mannitol Required to Generate Clinical Improvement in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis

This was a phase IIa, randomised open label, dose response, cross-over, multicenter study in which 48 cystic  fibrosis  patients  (ITT  population)  received  4  doses  of  inhaled  mannitol:  40 mg  (1  x  40 mg capsule),  120 mg  (3  x  40 mg  capsules),  240 mg  (6  x  40 mg  capsules)  and  400 mg  (10  x  40 mg capsules) twice daily via a dry powder inhaler device for 2 weeks in a random order. Patients in the ITT population  were  aged  from  6  to  68  years  including  19  adults  (older  than  18  years)  and  29 children/adolescents (6 to 11 years:  n = 18; 12 to 17 years: n = 11). The study objective was to determine  the  dose  of  dry  powder  Mannitol  required  to  generate  clinical  improvement  in  FEV 1 in subjects with cystic fibrosis. Duration of the study was 13 weeks, including four treatment periods of two weeks with one week washout.

Treatmentdose

A clear dose effect between 40 mg to 400 mg was observed in this study as well as a dose dependent improvement in lung function as measured by absolute FEV1 value and FVC. The 400 mg dose was the most efficacious whereas the 40 mg dose did not demonstrate any efficacy. The 120 mg and 240 mg doses  showed  some  efficacy,  however,  the  effect  was  smaller  than  that  of  400  mg.  It  cannot  be established whether the 400 mg dose reached the plateau effect as no higher doses were tested. There were few differences between the doses in other spirometric measurements evaluated (FEF 25-75 and PEF).

## 2.5.2. Main studies

## Study DPM-CF-301: Long Term Administration of Inhaled Dry Powder Mannitol in Cystic Fibrosis - A Safety and Efficacy Study

## Methods

This  was  a  multicenter,  26  week  double  blind,  randomised,  2  parallel  groups,  controlled,  trial  to compare  inhaled  mannitol  400  mg  twice  daily  to  a  control  group  receiving  inhaled  mannitol  in  a 'subtherapeutic' dose of 50 mg twice daily.

## Study Participants

This  study included patients from 6 years of age with mild to moderate cystic fibrosis but excluded severe conditions and advanced stage of the disease. Subjects needed to have FEV1 &gt;30 and &lt;90% predicted  and  to  pass  the  mannitol  tolerance  test  to  enter  the  study.  Pregnant,  breast-feeding  and intolerant to mannitol or beta-agonists subjects and subjects with concomitant use of beta blockers or hypertonic saline were excluded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

Patients in the active group received 400 mg (10 x 40 mg capsule) of mannitol twice daily, and in the control group 50 mg (10 x 5 mg capsules) of mannitol twice daily. Patients received the therapy for 26 weeks via CE marked DPI Type RS01 Model 7 HR.

RhDNase  use  was  permitted  and  the  randomisation  was  stratified  on  rhDNase  status  at  baseline (rhDNase user or rhDNase non users). If rhDNase use was initiated or ceased during the course of the study, the stratum was not adjusted.

## Objectives

The study was aimed at investigating the efficacy and safety of inhaled mannitol for treatment of CF.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was the change in absolute FEV1 over 26 weeks of therapy.

Secondary Efficacy endpoints were:

-  Change from baseline in absolute FEV1 by rhDNase treatment over 26 weeks
-  Responders at week 26 on the basis of a 100 ml or &gt;5% change in FEV1 or total cohort and by rhDNase use
-  Pulmonary exacerbations - protocol defined and all exacerbations for total cohort and by rhDNase use
-  Hospital admissions - protocol defined and all pulmonary exacerbations
-  Quality of Life Scores using Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire- R for total cohort and by rhDNase use
-  Responders at week 26 on the basis of a change in QoL which is ≥ 5 points for total cohort and by rhDNase use; Rescue antibiotics use (number of agents, course and days of use)
-  Change from baseline in FVC, FEF25-75 over 26 weeks overall and by rhDNase use
-  Days in hospital due to pulmonary exacerbations - protocol defined and all exacerbations

A  protocol  defined  pulmonary  exacerbation  (PDPE)  was  any  exacerbation  treated  with  IV  antibiotics and associated with at least four of the following signs and symptoms: change in sputum production (volume, colour, consistency), dyspnoea, new or increased haemoptysis, malaise fatigue or lethargy, fever  &gt;38  degrees  Celsius,  anorexia  or  weight  loss,  sinus  pain  or  tenderness,  change  in  sinus discharge,  FVC  or  FEV1  decreased  by  &gt;10%  from  previous  recorded  value,  radiographic  signs indicative of pulmonary infection, increased cough, changes in physical examination of the chest.

A pulmonary exacerbation (PE) did not have to meet the aforementioned additional criteria.

## Sample size

340  subjects  were  intended  to  be  randomised  to  treatment.    Approximately  two  thirds  of  these subjects were expected to be using rhDNase and approximately 20% of subjects were forecasted to withdraw  prior  to  week  26.  Therefore,  approximately  163  evaluable  subjects  were  estimated  to complete  the  mannitol  treatment  and  109  evaluable  subjects  in  the  control  treatment.  It  was estimated that of these evaluable subjects, approximately 109 subjects in the mannitol group and 73

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects in the control group would be taking concurrent rhDNase. The study was powered to detect a FEV1 change of 70 mL from baseline in the ITT population at week 26.

## Randomisation

Randomisation was to be applied to subjects who passed the mannitol tolerance test in a ratio of 3:2 (mannitol 400mg BD: control). The randomisation was stratified by rhDNase use and region (Europe vs.  Australia)  but  not  by  sites,  age  or  severity  of  the  disease.  250  randomisation  numbers  (150 mannitol and 100 control) were generated for each stratum, in blocks of 5. The randomisation number was assigned sequentially within each stratum.

## Blinding (masking)

The  investigators,  site  staff,  pharmacists,  subjects,  monitors,  project  managers  and  data  managers were  blinded  throughout  the  study.  Both  active  and  control  treatments  consisted  of  ten  identical capsules. The use of opaque capsules was aimed at masking the difference in the capsule fill volume.

## Statistical methods

For change in FEV1 an analysis of this endpoint at Visit 2/Week 6, Visit 3/Week 14 and Visit 4/Week 26 was conducted using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) approach. The following main effect terms were specified in the applied model: treatment group, visit week, gender, rhDNase user status at screening, region of participation, baseline FEV1, baseline percent predicted FEV1, and age.

An AR(1) covariance structure was used. For each study visit, the difference between treatments was determined as the difference in least squares means for mannitol - control and was presented with 95% confidence limits. Overall, the statistical significance of the difference was estimated using the Pvalue for the term for treatment in the model.

A further model was fitted with a term for treatment-by-time interaction to obtain least square means (with  95%  confidence  limits)  for  each  treatment  group  for  each  timepoint.  The  analyses  described above were repeated by rhDNase use (using a three way interaction model for time-by-treatment-byrhDNase  use).  Data  summaries  are  also  provided  for  the  paediatric/adolescent  population  but  no analyses were undertaken.

No imputation for missing data was planned. Analysis of the primary efficacy variable was conducted using a mixed model (within SAS PROC Mixed) where all available data are used. The applicant states that missing values are not problematic, provided the data are missing at random. The only missing data  for  FEV 1 was  due  to  premature  withdrawal  of  subjects.  A  Kaplan  Meier  plot  was  produced  to explore the pattern of withdrawal.

For the key secondary endpoints apart from FEV1, namely pulmonary exacerbations and antibiotic use, the time in the study was incorporated in the analysis through the use of a negative binomial model with exposure time as an offset variable. Hence no imputation for missing data was considered to be required.

ITT population was defined as those subjects randomised who had completed study visit 1 at week 0, i.e. received at least one dose of study medication.

## Recruitment

324 patients were randomised in ratio 3:2. 192 were allocated to mannitol 400 mg BD and 132 were allocated to control mannitol 50 mg BD.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Conduct of the study

The study was conducted from 5 April 2007 to 24 April 2009 in 40 study sites in UK, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.

2  amendments  to  study  protocol  were  made  prior  to  study  initiation  and  included  administrative changes  and  changes  recommended  during  scientific  advice/protocol  assistance  (adding  MTT  test, removing  200 mg  group,  introducing  stratification  by  rhDNase  use,  defining  PDPE  criteria  and removing CRP analysis and chest X-ray). There have been 2 amendments to Study Protocol during the study, increasing number of participants, introducing interim safety evaluation, administrative changes and open-label extension phase.

## Numbers analysed

389  subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  study  and  324  of  those  were  randomised.  The  ITT  population consisted of 295 subjects (177 mannitol, 118 control) and the PP population - of 200 subjects (111 mannitol, 89 control).

Approximately a quarter of the patients on mannitol treatment (45 of 177, 25.4%) were excluded from the PP population because of failure to record both a baseline (Visit 1) lung function measurement or at least one measurement at a timepoint (Visits 2, 3 or 4) during treatment.  For the control arm the percentage was considerably lower (15 of 118, 12.7%), although still relatively high.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes and estimation

The analysis submitted by the applicant showed a significant treatment effect at week 26 as change from baseline in absolute FEV1: + 92.9 ml as compared to the control group (p&lt;0.001).

Figure 4. Absolute Change in FEV 1 (mL) by Timepoint

<!-- image -->

The overall treatment effect over 26 weeks (defined primary efficacy endpoint) was 54.17 ml (95% CI: 24.73, 83.60) and was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001).

When the analysis was performed in stratified subgroups defined by the rhDNase status at screening, the between groups difference in FEV1 at week 26 was statistically significant in the so called rhDNase users strata (108 ml) but not in the so called rhDNase non users strata (69 ml). However, it appears that the mean change in absolute FEV1 was higher in the strata of rhDNase non users as compared to the strata of rhDNase users.

Similar patterns were seen in other spirometric parameters but the absolute change from baseline in FEF25-75 and PEF were not found to be significantly different between the 2 groups.

The  secondary  parameters  associated  with  pulmonary  exacerbation  rate,  hospitalisations,  Quality  of Life  and  use  of  systemic  antibiotics  did  not  show  any  significant  differences  between  patients  using rhDnase  with  mannitol  or  mannitol  alone.  However,  trends  were  noted  in  favour  of  the  patients receiving rhDNase and mannitol together as compared with mannitol alone.

## Ancillary analyses

A post hoc analysis of the rate of responders was performed in the population of patients completing the 26 weeks study with both baseline and visit 4 values for FEV1 (responders were defined as mean improvement from baseline in FEV1 of &gt;100 ml or &gt;5% (relative to baseline), or &gt;5% relative change in % predicted were considered as responders. Among the completers receiving mannitol 400 mg BD only 41.4 % (n=48 patients/116 completers) had more than 5% increase in FEV1 % predicted. This represents 48/177 = 27 % of the ITT population initially randomised to mannitol 400 mg BD. The rate of responders to mannitol 400 mg BD, as determined in a post hoc analysis, appears to be rather low.

Upon request from the CHMP the applicant performed analysis of change in FEV1 efficacy outcomes in % predicted, which are presented below.

Since approximately 30% of the patients discontinued from the study, in some cases without providing any post baseline value of FEV1, a sensitivity analysis was performed in order to handle missing data.

The applicant  has  provided  an  ancillary  analysis  in  the adolescent/paediatric population.  The  ITT (safety) population included 105 patients consisting of 48 paediatrics from 6 to 11 years (mannitol 400 mg : 31) and 57 adolescents from 12 to 17 years (mannitol 400 mg: 32). There was also a high rate of premature withdrawals more in adolescent (31.5%) than in paediatrics (25%), and the 2 groups were unbalanced (no stratification was planned by age). Few conclusions can be drawn from this analysis. Basically, no significant difference was shown on FEV1 between the treatment groups. For the FEF 2575 mean changes from baseline were even lesser in the mannitol 400 mg group as compared to the control group.

Study DPM-CF-302: Long Term Administration of Inhaled Dry Powder Mannitol in Cystic Fibrosis - A Safety and Efficacy Study

<!-- image -->

## Methods

This  was  a  multicenter,  26  week  double  blind,  randomised,  2  parallel  groups,  controlled,  trial  to compare  inhaled  mannitol  400  mg  twice  daily  to  a  control  group  receiving  inhaled  mannitol  in 'subtherapeutic' dose of 50 mg twice daily.

## Study Participants

This study included patients above 6 years of age with mild to moderate cystic fibrosis but excluded severe conditions and advanced stage of the disease. Subjects needed to have FEV1 &gt;40 and &lt;90% predicted  and  to  pass  mannitol  tolerance  test  to  enter  the  study.  Pregnant,  breast-feeding  and intolerant to mannitol or beta-agonists subjects and subjects with concomitant use of beta blockers or hypertonic saline were excluded, as well as subjects who have had a significant episode of haemoptysis (&gt; 60 ml) in the previous three months or had selected serious health conditions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

Patients  in  active  group  received  400  mg  (10  x  40  mg  capsule)  of  mannitol  twice  daily,  and  in  the control group 50 mg (10 x 5 mg capsules) of mannitol twice daily. Patients received the therapy for 26 weeks via CE marked DPI Type RS01 Model 7 HR.

RhDNase  use  was  permitted  and  the  randomisation  was  stratified  on  rhDNase  status  at  baseline (rhDNase user or rhDNase non users). If rhDNase use was initiated or ceased during the course of the study, the stratum was not adjusted.

## Objectives

The study was aimed at investigating the efficacy and safety of inhaled mannitol for treatment of CF.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoint was change in absolute FEV1 over 26 weeks of therapy.

Secondary Efficacy endpoints were:

-  FEV1 change from baseline (ml) in the rhDNase group
-  Pulmonary exacerbations in those taking rhDNase as a sub-group and in the total cohort
-  Quality of life scores using Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-R
-  Rescue antibiotic use (number of agents, course and days of use)
-  Change in absolute FVC, FEF25-75 from baseline
-  Number of days in hospital due to pulmonary exacerbations
-  Qualitative sputum microbiology
-  Quantitative sputum microbiology for S. aureus and P. aeruginosa

## Sample size

300  subjects  were  intended  to  be  randomised  to  treatment.    Approximately  two  thirds  of  these subjects were expected to be using rhDNase and approximately 30% of subjects were forecasted to withdraw  prior  to  week  26.  Therefore,  approximately  126  evaluable  subjects  were  estimated  to complete the mannitol treatment and 84 evaluable subjects in the control treatment. It was estimated that  of  these  evaluable  subjects,  approximately  84  subjects  in  the  mannitol  group  would  be  taking concurrent rhDNase.

The study was planned to have 98% powered to detect a FEV1 change of 120 mL in the ITT population at week 26 and 80% power in the rhDNase users.

## Randomisation

Randomisation  was  to  be  applied  to  subjects  who  passed  mannitol  tolerance  test  in  a  ratio  of  3:2 (mannitol 400mg BD: control). The randomisation was stratified by rhDNase use and country but not by sites, age or severity of the disease. 300 randomisation numbers (180 mannitol and 120 control) were generated for each stratum, in blocks of 5 which were paired for rhDNase users and non-users.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Blinding (masking)

The  investigators,  site  staff,  pharmacists,  subjects,  monitors,  project  managers  and  data  managers were  blinded  throughout  the  study.  Both  active  and  control  treatments  consisted  of  ten  identical capsules. The use of opaque capsules was aimed at masking the difference in the capsule fill volume.

## Statistical methods

The statistical methods were similar to the methods applied in study CF-301. In addition, for primary endpoint analysis a treatment group by visit week interaction was also included in the MMRM model. The analysis also did not include week 0 in assessment of the treatment effect, which was included in the pre-defined analysis for study CF-301.

## Recruitment

318 patients were randomised in ratio 3:2. 192 were allocated to mannitol 400 mg BD and 126 were allocated to control mannitol 50 mg BD.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Conduct of the study

The study was conducted from 3 September 2008 to 12 April 2010 in 53 study sites in USA, Canada, Argentina, Germany, Belgium, France and the Netherlands.

There  have  been  2  amendments  to  Study  Protocol,  increasing  number  of  participants,  introducing minor changes in MTT, randomisation and unblinding procedures as well as administrative changes.

## Baseline data

The overview of baseline data of subjects has been provided by the applicant for the safety population which is identical to defined (modified) ITT population (all subjects who received at least one dose of study medication).

The analysis of primary endpoint showed overall treatment effect over 26 weeks in change in absolute FEV1 of 54.14 ml as compared to the control group, which was not statistically significant (p=0.059). The applicant performed a post hoc corrected baseline analysis (based on average of screening and baseline FEV1) using the MMRM model.

When the analysis was performed in stratified subgroups defined by the rhDNase status at screening, the between groups difference in FEV1 at week 26 was not statistically significant in either of strata, while the trend was favourable for mannitol (overall treatment effect in rhDNase users 43.49 ml, p = 0.177,  and  in  non-users  86.5  ml,  p=0.124).  As  in  study  CF-301,  also  in  this  study  it  appears  that effect on absolute FEV1 was higher in the strata of rhDNase non users as compared to the strata of rhDNase users.

There  were  no  meaningful  differences  in  mean  change  over  baseline  for  either  treatment  group  or between treatment groups for any of the QoL domains.

## Ancillary analyses

In  order  to  address  the  high  number  of  patients discontinued from the study (though lower than in study CF-301), a sensitivity analysis was performed in order to handle missing data.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

The applicant has presented efficacy analysis across phase 3 trials. For the change in FEV1 the results are  presented  below  in  comparison  to  the  results  of  individual  studies.  For  pooled  data  the  overall treatment effect over 26 weeks is estimated for FEV1 as 2.12 % predicted. However as the results of the two studies are not consistent a pooled analysis is not considered appropriate.

## Clinical studies in special populations

One phase II study was conducted in children.

## Study DPM-CF-203: A cross-over comparative study of inhaled Mannitol, alone and in combination with daily rhDNase, in children with cystic fibrosis

This  was  an  open  label,  multicentre,  randomised,  cross-over,  comparative  study.  After  satisfying inclusion and exclusion criteria, subjects were given the mannitol tolerance test to screen for airway hyper-reactivity. Those with a negative MTT test result were randomised to one of three cross-over treatments  in  a  1:1:1  ratio  to  receive  for  12  weeks  either  400  mg  Mannitol  twice  daily,  2.5  mg rhDNase  daily,  or  400  mg  Mannitol  twice  daily  plus  2.5  mg  rhDNase  daily  according  to  one  of  six treatment schedules, which were also randomly assigned. All subjects received all three treatments. There was a two week washout period prior to each treatment.

## Results

No statistically significant differences in FEV1 or FVC changes were observed when comparing rhDNase treatment to  either  Mannitol  or  rhDNase  plus  Mannitol  treatment.  No  other  spirometry  results  were significantly different between the arms. The change in FEV1 was smaller in the Mannitol plus rhDNase arm than either the rhDNase or Mannitol alone arms (0.8% vs 9.1% vs 6.4% in ITT analysis and 1.0% vs 9.3% and 8.3% in the PP analysis). The rhDNase and Mannitol alone treatments resulted in similar spirometry improvements.

However,  there  was  a  trend  for  a  smaller  effect  when  rhDNase  and  mannitol  were  both  used  as compared to rhDNase used alone (mean percentage change in FEV1 between mannitol+rhDNase and rhDNase alone = - 4.3 %; [95% CI: -14.1 to +6.5]). The same trends were also shown on FEF 25-75

No significant differences were noted in Quality of Life CFQ-R scores when the rhDNase treatment arm was compared to either of the Mannitol or rhDNase plus Mannitol arms. The Mannitol plus rhDNase arm showed the biggest reduction in score (worsening of symptoms). No significant differences were noted for any respiratory symptoms questions between the comparator treatment, rhDNase, and the other two treatment arms. The comparison between the rhDNase and Mannitol treatment arms for tiredness, while  not  significant,  had  a  probability  of  0.078,  with  subjects  reporting  less  tiredness  during  the Mannitol treatment arm.

Sputum microbiology results showed no notable changes in microbial growth in any treatment arm.

The  rhDNase  arm  had  3  (14.3%)  patients  who  reported  an  exacerbation,  while  there  were  also  3 (13.0%)  patients  (p  =  1.000)  in  the  mannitol  arm  and  6 (26.1%)  patients  (p  =  0.2568)  in  the rhDNase  plus  mannitol  arm.  These  observations  would  rather  suggest  a  lesser  efficiency  of  the mucocilliary clearance when mannitol was associated to rhDNase.

## DPM-CF-201 A Phase 2 Study to Determine the Safety and Efficacy of Inhaled Dry Powder Mannitol in Cystic Fibrosis

This  was  a  randomised,  multicentre,  double-blinded,  controlled,  crossover,  phase  II  study  primarily determining the efficacy of inhaled mannitol in improving lung function and quality of life in subjects with cystic fibrosis. Study included subjects with a known diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, of either gender, aged  8 years, having a baseline FEV1 of between 40% and 80% of the predicted normal value or a decline in FEV1 of greater than 20% in the last twelve months. This study was conducted in a sample of  37  patients  (ITT)  aged  from  8  to  48  years  (mean:  19  years)  who  received  420  mg  BD  inhaled mannitol and non-respirable mannitol (average particle diameter 68 microns, fine particle fraction less than 2%) for 2 weeks in a cross over design. At visits 2 and 4 the initial dose of study medication was administered i.e. 30mg of Inhaled mannitol or control x 14 capsules (a dose of 420mg) twice a day. A bronchodilator (salbutamol 100 mcg, 4 puffs) was inhaled 15 minutes prior to a treatment. Dry powder inhaler  devices  were  used  for  administration.  The  DPM-CF-201  protocol  was  amended  twice  before

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

enrolment commenced. The main changes in these amendments were the lowering of entry age to 8 years.

Primary Objective of the study was to determine the effect of two weeks twice daily treatment with Inhaled mannitol (inhaled mannitol) on FEV1 in subjects with cystic fibrosis.

Figure 19. Subject Disposition in study DPM-CF-201

<!-- image -->

Treatment with Inhaled mannitol led to a 7.0 ± 1.9% (mean ± SE) increase in the FEV1 (p&lt;0.001) and this  increase  was  significant  compared  to  the  change  on  placebo  treatment  (p&lt;0.01).  The  absolute increase in FEV1 on Inhaled mannitol treatment was 121 ± 33 ml (mean ± SE). The mean FEV1 % of normal  predicted  increased  from  62%  at  baseline  to  66%  i.e.  LS  mean  FEV 1 (expressed  as  %  of normal predicted value) change from baseline was + 3.86% (SD  1.08).

Although  statistically  significant  (p&lt;0.01)  as  compared  to  the  control  group  (LS  mean  change  from baseline  in  the  control  group=  -  0.09),  the  improvement  from  baseline  appeared  very  weak.  The change from baseline of FEV1 % of predicted was under the threshold of 5% usually considered as clinically  significant.  FEV 1 /FVC,  FEF25-75 and  PEF  increase  were  not  significant  on  inhaled  mannitol treatment  group  as  compared  to  control  (p=0.3).  The  differences  in  respiratory  symptoms  and respiratory domains of CF QOL questionnaire were very small and not clinically relevant.

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

Studies  DPM-CF-301  and  DPM-CF-302  are  of  identical  design  (multicenter,  26  week  double  blind, randomised, 2 parallel groups, controlled, trial to compare inhaled mannitol 400 mg twice daily to a control group receiving inhaled mannitol in a 'subtherapeutic' dose of 50 mg twice daily).

Subjects less than 6 years of age were not considered for Phase 3 trials since mannitol tolerance test (MTT)  and  reliable  spirometry  measurements  are  not  adequately  achievable  in  children  and  infants

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

below this age. This is justified since children below 6 years of age are generally not able to use a dry powder inhaler.

During  the  assessment  the  applicant  limited  the  proposed  indication  to  adults  (aged  18  years  and above) only, however data on all age groups is being analysed in order to assess the consistency.

The  doses  of  400  mg  for  the  active  treatment  and  50  mg  for  control  group  were  chosen  by  the applicant based mainly on the results from the dose response 2 week Phase II trial DPM-CF-202 where the 400 mg dose was shown to be the most efficacious whereas the 40 mg dose did not demonstrate any efficacy. The applicant stated that the 40 mg fill capsules were chosen for the phase 3 studies as this  was  the  largest  dose  that  could  effectively  be  delivered  via  the  intended  inhaler  device.  With consideration that utilizing more than 10 capsules may overly compromise subject's compliance with treatment,  the  applicant  considered  that  400  mg  dose  was  the  most  appropriate  balance  between acceptability/tolerability and efficacy. Because the control had to be delivered across 10 capsules and 5 mg was the smallest available fill, a final dose of 50 mg (5 mg x 10) was selected as control group for this study. During study DPM-CF-202, however, the plateau was not reached and it is therefore not known, what effect higher doses would have.

In study DPM-CF-302 better training was provided to study personnel at the sites which led to fewer dropouts  (a  decrease  from  around  30%  to  around  15%  in  study  DPM-CF-302).  The  other  main difference between the two studies was the percentage of patients under 18 which was around 50% in study DPM-CF-302 compared to approximately 36% in study DPM-CF-301.

The population in study DPM-CF-301 included patients aged from 6 to 59 years.  However no attempt was made to stratify the randomisation into different age ranges or to ensure that the sample size provided sufficient patients in each age group. However it was recognised that children (aged 6 - 11), adolescents  (aged  12  -  17)  and  adults  aged  18  years  and  above  formed  three  clear  subgroups. Furthermore  it  has  been  suggested  in  the  literature  that  treatment  for  cystic  fibrosis  has  improved considerably in recent years so that children born more recently will possibly have received better care immediately after  diagnosis  improving  their  lung  function  more  than  what  was  possible  for  patients born  earlier.  Also  the  choice  of  the  primary  endpoint  based  on  lung  function  is  problematic  in  such broad population as FEV1 will naturally increase as children and adolescents grow in height, thereby increasing the size of lung.

Although the block size chosen for the randomisation scheme in study DPM-CF-301 was small and the majority (30) of the 40 centres recruited 5 or more patients, the randomisation was not stratified by centre resulting in an imbalance in the majority of centres. This is considered to be a serious deficiency in  the  study  and  prevents  adjustment  of  the  statistical  analysis  for  any  possible  centre  effects. Furthermore, no estimates of treatment difference by centre have been presented making it difficult to confirm  the  homogeneity  of  effect  across  the  centres.  No  justification  for  use  of  region  as  a stratification factor instead of study centre has been provided by the applicant. In addition, it is unclear if other methods of stratification were considered such as division into centres recruiting children only, adults only or both age groups of patients by region.

Approximately  30%  of  patients  discontinued  study  DPM-CF-301  before  the  end  of  the  randomised treatment  period  of  26  weeks,  while  the  statistical  methods  used  for  the  analysis  of  the  primary endpoint are not considered adequate to account for the large amount of missing data. Overall the handling  of  missing  data  was  limited  and  a  number  of  additional  analyses  and  investigations  are necessary to confirm that the results reported from the MMRM analysis are robust and reliable over the totality of this heterogeneous population. It is not accepted that the pre-specified MMRM model itself provided robust estimates of treatment differences in both studies (as claimed by the applicant) as it likely  would  overestimate  the  effect  in  Study  DPM-CF-301  where  a  large  percentage  of  patients discontinued early resulting in high levels of missing data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  sensitivity  analysis  used  10  different  methods  to  handle  missing  data.  It  should  be  noted  that analysis Method 10 is not appropriate. Although for study DPM-CF-302 results this was used by the applicant to reanalyse the primary endpoint which had failed to achieve statistical significance in the pre-specified  analysis,  the  reason  for  including  the  average  of  screening  and  baseline  FEV 1 as  a covariate is not accepted. The use of the baseline value as a covariate is considered the appropriate method of adjustment only for an endpoint based on change from baseline.

The indication sought by the applicant includes two distinct groups of patients and it is unclear how the findings  reported  apply  to  both.  Furthermore,  the  investigation  of  the  effect  in  different  important subgroups has not been sufficiently carried out. Although the subgroups by rhDNase use have been analysed and suggest a difference in effect between the two, consistency of effect across subgroups according to age has not been established (see below).

The  study  design  does  not  allow  to  establish  whether  rhDNase  non  users  at  baseline  were  indeed patients who did not derive benefit from rhDNase i.e. inadequately responsive to rhDNase as claimed in the indication of the proposed SPC. Study DPM-CF-203 is the only study with a direct comparison between rhDNase and Mannitol 400 mg bd in a cross over design. The results presented, however, do not  allow  to  establish  whether  mannitol  can  be  an  alternative  in  those  patients  who  will  not  obtain benefit  with  rhDNase  since  it  is  not  known  if  included  patients  actually  did  not  obtain  benefit  from rhDNase treatment. Furthermore, results indicate that combination of mannitol and rhDNase does not convey additional benefit. It therefore cannot be determined from this study whether or not mannitol will provide better benefit (or even worsening) in patients not fully responding to rhDNase.

It should be noted that the most appropriate presentation of the results for the overall population aged 6 years and over is considered to be in terms of FEV1 as percent predicted normal not the unadjusted FEV1 value that was applied according to study protocols.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

In the study DPM-CF-201, the effect of inhaled mannitol 420 mg appeared rather weak, although an effect is shown as compared to the control group. This study is presented by the applicant as a proof of concept  study  and  no  direct  conclusion  can  be  drawn  as  it  was  performed  with  different  doses  of mannitol (420 mg x 2 daily), different capsules of mannitol (filling with 30 mg powder), and different dry powder inhaler than those proposed for use in the present application for inhaled mannitol. About half  of  the  studied  population  was treated with rhDNase at baseline (18 patients out of 39), but no interpretation can be provided on the results obtained in patients with concomitant use of RhDNase and those not using concomitant rhDNase as the study was not designed for this consideration.

The pivotal study DPM-CF-301 showed a statistically significant increase of 92 ml in FEV1 by 26 weeks compared to the control group. This translates in an improvement of 2 to 3 % of FEV1 as expressed as FEV1  %  predicted.  The  clinical  relevance  was  questioned  because  of  the  large  drop  out  rate,  the statistical  methods  used  to  assess  this  change,  and  the  large  effect  noted  in  the  subgroup  where mannitol  was  used  in  conjunction  with  rhDNase  (change  of  108 ml)  compared  with  those  using mannitol alone (69 ml).

The analysis of the primary endpoint in study DPM-CF-302, change from baseline in absolute FEV1, in the  overall  population  failed  to  achieve  statistical  significance  (p=0.059)  using  the  pre-specified statistical  analysis  method.  Similarly  the  analysis  of  change  from  baseline  of  FEV 1 as  percentage  of predicted normal did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference (p=0.052).  It is of note that the European guideline on multiplicity issues in clinical trials (CPMP/EWP/908/99) concludes that claims on statistically significant and clinically relevant findings based on subgroups are possible only after the primary objective has been achieved and if pre-specified. This is not the case in this study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The applicant has argued that an unexpectedly large change between screening and baseline in the control group had contributed to a reduced treatment effect in the primary endpoint of study DPM-CF302. Although this may be true, it is not acceptable to conduct a second analysis using a post-hoc baseline  correction  using  the  average  of  the  screening  and  baseline  values  in  order  to  obtain  a significant  result.  As  described  in  current  European  guidance  on  adjustment  for  baseline  covariates (CPMP/EWP/2863/99) the analysis of change from baseline without adjusting in the model for baseline as a covariate is not appropriate. There is no scientific rationale to support the adjustment used in the post-hoc analysis which is not accepted.

It  is  unclear  if  the  problem  of  high  rates  of  missing  data  was  limited  to  a  particular  subgroup  of patients such as children or if it was distributed evenly across all subgroups of the population. This raises concerns over the quality of the data provided, especially by study DPM-CF-301.

Sensitivity analysis clearly indicates the lack of consistency of the estimated treatment difference in study DPM-CF-301. The discontinuation rate for study DPM-CF-302 is considerably lower than for study DPM-CF-301, although certainly not negligible, being slightly less than 15%. However the sensitivity analysis for study DPM-CF-302 presents more consistent estimates of treatment difference using the same  analysis  methods  as  applied  for  study  DPM-CF-301,  although  somewhat  lower  around  2%  in terms of change from baseline in percentage predicted normal FEV1.

Thus  it  may  be  argued  that  the  important  issue  is  not  which  analysis  method  provides  the  most appropriate estimate but whether the different methods of handling the missing data have a profound effect  on  the  estimate  or  whether  it  remains  fairly  consistent  indicating  that  the  results  are  robust. Therefore it is considered that due to the high discontinuation rate from study DPM-CF-301 the results are less reliable than those from study DPM-CF-302 where the applicant admits that higher levels of training were provided to the study centres based on the experience gained from the earlier study. As the quality of the two studies is considered to be different the pooled data does not necessarily provide better estimates of the treatment difference.

The relevance of the improvement in FEV1 seen in the rhDNase and mannitol users' strata is not clear. As the actual use in the rhDNase strata during the study period is not clarified by the applicant, no reliable conclusion regarding the efficacy and safety of mannitol alone or as add on therapy to rhDNase can  be  drawn  from  the  results  presented  by  the  applicant.  If  it  is  assumed  that  included  patients maintained rhDNase use unchanged during the study, several issues arise.

Firstly, the sub therapeutic dose of the control group, inhaled mannitol 50 mg bid, is questionable. In the control group of rhDNase non users strata (assumed to correspond to mannitol 50 mg BD as the sole  mucoactive  drug  being  administered)  least  squares  means  estimates  for  FEV 1 absolute  change from baseline at week 26 was 88.7 ml (95% CI 32.12, 145.27) in study DPM-CF-301 and 78.44 ml (95%  CI  -41.50,  198.38)  in  study  DPM-CF-302.  However,  patients  were  pre-treated  with  a  beta agonist, which might increase FEV1 by 10-15%. In this subgroup, the change from baseline in absolute FEV1 reached the threshold that was defined as clinically significant in the statistical analysis plan (&gt;70 ml  was  the  threshold  of  statistical  hypothesis).  Therefore  the  effect  of  50  mg  might  not  be  subtherapeutic, as a significant effect was observed. The adequacy of the control is questionable especially with  regards  to  the  between  groups  comparison  of  the  incidences  of  adverse  events,  where  the sensitivity would be limited and no reliable conclusion can be drawn on safety assessment. The dose of 50  mg  is  in the middle  of  the  range  used  as  a  bronchoprovocation  test  and  may  induce bronchoconstriction during exacerbations even if initial falls in FEV1 at screening were below 20%.

When considering the effect on change in absolute FEV1 from baseline, the change from baseline with mannitol 400 mg bd appeared lower in the rhDNase users than in the rhDNase non user strata. This suggests that the addition of mannitol to rhDNase could possibly produce a smaller effect as compared to mannitol alone. This cannot be excluded, as it was evoked in the small phase II DPM-CF-203 study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The only conclusion that would be allowed is that the combination of both treatments needs further evidence.

Moreover, there is a concern over the unexpected heterogeneity across the age groups, especially in study  DPM-CF-302  where  the  applicant  has  been  unable  to  explain  the  total  lack  of  effect  in  the adolescent subgroup compared with the subgroups of children and adults.

The table below presents the number of patients in each subgroup by age and rhDNase use.

Results for the overall population as well as the subgroups by age for the change from baseline in FEV1 as  percentage  of  predicted  normal  are  summarised  below.  Although  the  table  above  indicates  the numbers of patients in each subgroup, the numbers included in the analysis presented in the table below  have  not  been  provided  by  the  applicant.  As  the  trial  has  not  been  powered  for  individual subgroups by age, the p-values for the subgroups are not important. However, the lack of consistency of effect across age groups with different patterns in the two studies is clearly shown.

It is important to note that although the percentage of children and adolescents in study DPM-CF-301 is relatively small with two thirds of the patients 18 years or over, in study DPM-CF-302 over 30% of the patients are in the adolescent subgroup with almost a further 20% under 12 years.  Therefore, the subgroups  by  age  are  fairly  well  represented  although  the  study  is  not  powered  for  statistical significance in the subgroups.

A possible explanation could be lack of compliance in the adolescent population. Although information has  been  provided  for  the  overall  population  which  would  suggest  that  average  compliance  was reasonably high at 94%, unfortunately this information has not been provided by age subgroup, but the data on compliance provided do not indicate there was an issue with it. Furthermore, estimation of compliance is possibly unreliable since it was based only on counting returned unused mediation and empty blister packaging. Moreover, lack of compliance cannot justify the differences in results seen in children under 12 in the two studies. A reasonable explanation for these heterogenic results seen in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients under 18 can not be found; this renders the results of both phase III studies - including the results in the adults only group - unreliable, as there is not sufficient confidence that the consistency seen in adults was not by chance.

Overall,  the  FEF  25-75  mean  changes  from  baseline  were  lesser  in  the  mannitol  400  mg  group  as compared to the control group for both adolescent and paediatric groups. This observation is worthy to be considered since FEF25-75 is generally more accurate to assess the small airways. The evidence of improvement of clearance of mucus in distal and small airways is lacking. In the presented data in children the 50 mg dose has a significant effect on FEV1 and overall the FEF25-75 results were lowered with the full dose of 400 mg mannitol as compared to mannitol 50 mg. It could also suggest that the mannitol 400 mg might be rather deleterious as compared to lower dose of 50 mg in children with small airways, maybe due to a elevated dose that would exert a 'too great increased in viscosity' with inefficient  mucociliary  clearance.  Clearly  the  appropriate  dose  in  paediatrics  need  to  be  further investigated to be determined.

The pivotal studies (DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302) do not provide adequate evidence of efficacy. The change  in  FEV1  %  predicted  is  very  small  (around  2-3%)  and  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  effect observed on FEV1 has not been established.  The magnitude of the effect size is very small and not clinically significant. In clinical practice such small differences in FEV1 are not detected and cumulative benefit was not demonstrated.

## 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

In  both  pivotal  Phase  3  studies  the  effect  size  for  FEV 1 is  very  small  and  cannot  be  recognised  as clinically significant.

The lack of consistency across the trials in the individual age groups questions the value of the pooled analysis. Moreover there is serious concern over the lack of consistency both within the trials across age groups and between the two studies.

There is a serious concern over the differences in effect across the age groups which have not been explained and therefore raise concerns about the confidence in results of pivotal studies in general.

Studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302 do not establish the benefit of inhaled mannitol 400 mg BD as add on therapy to rhDNase, nor as alternative to rhDNase, in the claimed population of cystic fibrosis patients.

## 2.6. Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

The use of 400 mg inhaled mannitol has been studied in Cystic Fibrosis patients in studies, DPM-CF201, DPM-CF-202, DPM-CF-203, DPM-CF-301 and DPM-302 with a total of 511 patients exposed.  The applicant has also been studying this dose in patients with bronchiectasis in studies DPM-B-201, DPMB-202  and  at  dose  of  320 mg  bd  in  study  DPM-B-301,  with  a  total  of  289  patients  exposed.  This indicates that the overall safety sample represents 800 patients. In the bronchiectasis study DPM-B301 a further 99 patients were exposed to inhaled mannitol for 1 year.

The applicant has reported that as of February 2011 256 patients have received inhaled mannitol for treatment of Cystic fibrosis outside clinical studies.

## Adverse events

Inhaled mannitol at a dose of 400 mg bd has been associated with adverse events which affect the respiratory  tract  (area  it  is  delivered  in)  as  well  as  the  gastro-intestinal  tract.  The  most  common respiratory tract adverse event is cough, haemoptysis, pharyngolaryngeal pain. When mannitol is used in association with rhDNase there is a higher frequency of reports of cough, wheezing and haemoptysis (for  the  cough  the  difference  is  twice).  Gastrointestinal  tract  associated  adverse  events  are  clearly linked to some of the inhaled mannitol being swallowed by the patient, abdominal pain being the most common event.

Of note spontaneous adverse event reports have been received for 21 patients (out of estimated 256 exposed) in named-patient and special access schemes.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

Three deaths have been reported (two in study DPM-B-301 due to pneumonia and acute myocardial infarction;  one  in  study  DPM-CF-302  after  its  completion  due  to  pneumothorax),  but  were  thought probably  (pneumonia)  or  definitely  (myocardial  infarction  and  pneumothorax)  not  to  be  related  to treatment.

In  pivotal  studies,  during  the  26-week  randomised  treatment  phase,  77  (21.3%)  and  65  (27.2%) patients in the inhaled mannitol and control groups, respectively, experienced SAEs. The most common by SOC were general disorders and administration site conditions with 60 (16.6%) and 45 (18.8%) patients in the inhaled mannitol and control groups, respectively, experiencing SAEs in this SOC, all of which were condition aggravated, which was the PT chosen to indicate an exacerbation of pulmonary

CF. Other common SAEs by PT included haemoptysis in 8 (2.2%) and 2 (0.8%) patients and lower respiratory  tract  infection  in  4  (1.1%)  and  5  (2.1%)  patients  in  the  inhaled  mannitol  and  control groups, respectively.

1 Patients are counted only once at the system organ class level. Within each system organ class, subjects are counted once for each unique preferred term identified firom the CRF verbatim text.

Four  fatal  cases  have  been  reported  in  named-patient  and  special  access  schemes,  one  involving respiratory failure. It is, however, difficult to determine inhaled mannitol's role in this fatality because there is no indication of the seriousness of the respiratory decline in the patient concerned.

## Laboratory findings

There were no important abnormalities in laboratory tests in the data sets submitted.

## Immunological events

There have been no immunological events reported.

## Safety in special populations

66 paediatric patients and 88 adolescent patients received inhaled mannitol in Phase 3 CF trials. For all age  groups,  the  three  most  commonly  reported  treatment  related  AEs  were  condition  aggravated, headache and cough.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

There was no indication of safety concerns due to drug-drug interactions. It should, however, be noted that  an  increased  reporting  rate  of  some  adverse  events  (such  as  wheezing)  was  observed  when rhDNase and mannitol were used together. This observation requires further investigation.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

42 patients (11.6%) in the inhaled mannitol group and 15 (6.3%) in the control group withdrew from Phase 3 CF studies due to treatment-related adverse events.

The frequency of withdrawal from the study due to adverse events was low and the causes are in line with what could be expected from use of the product. There, however, is a concern since the studies (especially DPM-CF-301) had high drop out rate.

## Post marketing experience

Bronchitol  has  not  been  marketed.  The  applicant,  however,  has  provided  some  post  marketing surveillance data for product inhaled mannitol used for bronchoprovocation testing, which includes 8 spontaneous  adverse  reaction  reports  and  raise  no  concerns.  The  exposure  to  inhaled  mannitol  for bronchoprovocation testing as of April 2010 is estimated to be 59,812 patients.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

No  treatment  related  fatal  or  life  threatening  adverse  events  were  reported  in  clinical  trials. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders were the most frequent disorders.

The applicant was requested by the CHMP to discuss in detail the adverse events of interest from the two phase 3 studies - namely haemoptysis and bronchospasm. The latter is important also because mannitol is also used to provoke bronchoconstriction.

Haemoptysis was reported in considerably more patients in the inhaled mannitol arm compared to the control  arm.  In  studies  DPM-CF-301  and  DPM-CF-302  combined,  any  haemoptysis  was  reported  in 9.4% in the inhaled mannitol arm compared to 5.4% in the control arm. Of these severe were 1.1% in the  inhaled  mannitol  arm  compared  to  0.4%  in  the  control  arm.  The  applicant  then  examined  the frequency  of  haemoptysis  either  as  a  stand  alone  AE  or  as  a  reported  symptom  of  a  pulmonary exacerbation  (PE).  The  incidence  of  haemoptysis  was  similar  in  the  two  treatment  groups  (15.8% versus 14.6% for the Inhaled mannitol and control arms, respectively). However, as the applicant is claiming  that  inhaled  mannitol  reduces  the  rate  of  PE  this  should  have  lead  to  less  reporting  of haemoptysis due to PE following the reduction of the rate of  PE. Therefore, there is a possible link between inhaled mannitol and haemoptysis and further close monitoring of haemoptysis is necessary.

The applicant has analysed the reports of bronchoconstriction and associated events such as wheezing, dyspnoea and chest discomfort from the safety population of studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302.  In the  overall  population  events  of  this  type  were  reported  in  6.1%  in  the  inhaled  mannitol  group compared  to  5%  in  the  control  group.  There  appears  to  be  a  similar  number  of  reports  related  to bronchoconstriction. Patients are advised to receive a dose of bronchodilator 5 to 15 minutes before each dose of inhaled mannitol. The CHMP had a concern whether with long term use patients may become sensitised and not respond to bronchodilators, therefore additional discussion was requested from the applicant. The applicant had included bronchodilator response tests both at weeks 0 and 26 to demonstrate whether airways are sensitised by chronic use of inhaled mannitol. There was no change in both arms in the majority of patients (&lt;92%), but the data was dichotomised (change from &lt;12% to ≥ 12% reversibility) and therefore did not show the actual magnitude of the changes, which would have been more informative. Therefore no definitive conclusion can be made on this issue.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The  data  so  far  does  not  indicate  a  big  difference  in  events  associated  with  bronchoconstriction between the two groups. However, since inhaled mannitol is being used to provoke bronchoconstriction risk of bronchoconstriction requires close further monitoring.

There appears to be a possible link between haemoptysis and use of mannitol, which requires close further monitoring.

## 2.7. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk management plan

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The applicant submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan.

The RMP version 1.3 proposed additional pharmacovigilance activities and additional risk minimisation activities.  During  the  evaluation  the  CHMP  has  questioned  the  methodology  proposed  to  be  used  to verify  the  success  of  the  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  and  some  aspects  of  the  design proposed for the CF registry study.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application was of the opinion that it was not appropriate to conclude on pharmacovigilance and risk minimisation activities at the time of adoption of CHMP opinion and in view of benefit-risk balance conclusions and CHMP recommendations in section 3 below.

## 2.8. User consultation

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Inhalation  treatment  with  mannitol  is  intended  to  improve  mucociliary  clearance  by  creating  an osmotic gradient that leads to changes in surface properties in the airways. In the armamentarium of medicinal products for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, inhaled mannitol would therefore be placed as a mucolytic agent. In general, a clinically relevant improvement of lung function through measurement of FEV1 is considered adequate for the demonstration of efficacy for such products.

Two  phase  3  studies  of  similar  design  have  been  performed  (DPM-CF-301  and  DPM-CF-302), investigating the dose of inhaled mannitol 400 mg twice daily compared to a 'subtherapeutic' dose of 50 mg twice daily. The studies allowed the use of rhDNase. Study DPM-CF-301 showed a statistically significant overall treatment effect of 54.17 ml in FEV1 over 26 weeks compared to the control group (p&lt;0.001). The pre-specified  analysis of  the  primary  endpoint  in  study  DPM-CF-302  showed  overall treatment effect over 26 weeks in change in absolute FEV1 of 54.14 ml as compared to the control group, which was not statistically significant (p=0.059); additional post-hoc analyses were presented by the applicant.

Overall treatment with mannitol showed an improvement of approximately 2-3% compared with the control group over 26 weeks in terms of percent predicted FEV1. The clinical relevance of this minor improvement  has  not  been  established.  Compared  to  the  effect  size  of  other  treatments,  such  as bronchodilators or inhaled tobramycin, the size of the effect of inhaled mannitol on lung function is considered  small  and  with  questionable  clinical  importance.  Moreover,  there  was  no  significant difference on the secondary parameters as exacerbation rate, use of systemic antibiotics, hospitalisations and quality of life as compared to the comparator group.

Stratification by rhDNase at screening showed in study DPM-CF-301 a statistically significant difference in FEV1 at week 26 in the so called rhDNase users stratum (108 ml) but not in the so called rhDNase non-users  stratum  (69 ml).  In  study  DPM-CF-302  the  difference  was  not  statistically  significant  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

either stratum. There appears however in both studies to be a trend that the mean change in absolute FEV1 was higher in the stratum of rhDNase non-users as compared to the stratum of rhDNase users.

Patients above the age of 6 years were included in these two studies. Based on the available data, and in the absence of stratification, there appear to be three subgroups in terms of treatment effect, 6-11 years, 12-17 years and adults. However, given the limitation of the data in the paediatric population, the applicant revised the claimed indication during the procedure to use only in adults.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The major uncertainty is the fact that the reliability of the results from the two pivotal studies (DPMCF-301 and DPM-CF-302) is questionable.

-  Study DPM-CF-301 has failed to provide robust evidence of efficacy due to the high drop-out rate of  approximately  30%.  The  pre-defined  statistical  methods  are  not  deemed  suitable  for  dealing with  high  drop-out  rates  seen  in  this  study.  Sensitivity  analyses  clearly  indicate  the  lack  of consistency of the estimated treatment difference in this study.
-  Study DPM-CF-302 failed to reach statistical significance for its primary endpoint, which prevents from drawing conclusions about the results in study population subgroups. The post-hoc analysis proposed by the applicant was not considered acceptable. Furthermore, this study also demonstrated  lack  of  consistency  across  age  groups  despite  different  groups  being  fairly  well represented, which is a cause for concern since it questions the reliability of the estimates for both the overall population and the adult subgroup. The effect in children was found to be higher than in either adults or adolescents, with no effect in the adolescent subgroup.

Overall, there is a lack of consistency between the two studies in the estimated treatment effect in the overall population and, in particular, in children and adolescents (though the estimates for adults were similar  between  the  two  studies)\".  As  the  quality  of  the  two  pivotal  studies  is  considered  to  be different, the pooled data is not expected to provide better estimates of treatment difference.

With regard to the comparator, the effect of 50 mg of inhaled mannitol might not be sub-therapeutic, as a significant effect was observed in rhDNase non users in study DPM-CF-302, which raises doubts about the adequacy of the chosen control medication dose.

The  applicant  claims  an  indication  as  add-on  treatment  to  DNAse  as  well  as  the  use  in  patients ineligible, intolerant, or inadequately responsive to rhDNase. However, the design of phase 3 studies has not defined the subgroup of rhDNase users the same way as in the proposed indication. During the studies  it  was  not  established  upon  inclusion  of  non-users  of  rhDNase  if  they  would  or  would  not benefit from it, were they taking rhDNase. The actual use of rhDNase by subjects during the pivotal trials is unknown; therefore no reliable conclusion regarding the efficacy and safety of mannitol alone or as an add-on therapy to rhDNase can be drawn from the results presented. In addition, the large effect  in  the  subgroup  of  rhDNase  non-users,  as  compared  to  the  users,  has  not  been  sufficiently explained. This raises also concerns of a possible decrease in efficacy of inhaled mannitol when used in combination with rhDNase.

Given the uncertainties around the available efficacy data, the appropriateness of the actual dose of inhaled mannitol studied in the pivotal studies remains questionable. The potential effects of higher doses of inhaled mannitol have not been investigated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.2. Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The most important adverse effects were respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.

Mannitol is already used in the EU as an inhaled product to test for bronchial hyper-responsiveness. Although  a  bronchocontrictor  response  to  mannitol  was  used  as  an  exclusion  criterion  in  the  main trials,  the  use  of  such  an  exclusion  test  may  not  be  so  rigorous  outside  a  clinical  trial.  In  addition, given that airway hyper-responsiveness is common in cystic fibrosis, a patient who is negative to such a challenge may become positive during an exacerbation, in which case treatment with mannitol would increase the potential severity of the exacerbation.

The major adverse event-related concern was an increase in bronchoconstriction when mannitol was used in patients receiving inhaled rhDNase. There was also a small increase in haemoptysis which was consistently seen in both pivotal studies.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The increase in wheezing/bronchoconstriction among patients receiving mannitol within rhDNase users' strata highlights the potential increased risk related to the use of these two therapies together. It is therefore uncertain whether the product should be used with or without rhDNase.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

There is a small potential benefit in FEV1, without supporting clinical endpoint evidence, in two trials that  have  design  limitations.  The  clinical  relevance  of  this  small  potential  benefit  has  not  been established.  The  heterogeneity  of  the  results  seen  across  age  groups  in  both  studies  raises  serious concerns about the overall validity of the results, recognising that the claimed indication is in adults only.  In  addition,  the  benefits  of  the  use  together  with  rhDNase  are  uncertain  given  the  observed inconsistencies.

There  is  an  identified  risk  for  potentially  serious  adverse  events  such  as  bronchoconstriction  and haemoptysis, which with the uncertainties on the magnitude of effect renders the risk benefit balance negative.

The evidence of favourable risk benefit is lacking.

## Benefit-risk balance

Given  the  uncertainties  with  efficacy  in  the  claimed  patient  population  and  the  identified  risks  of bronchoconstriction  and  haemoptysis  the  benefit-risk  balance  for  inhaled  mannitol  in  the  proposed indication is considered negative.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.3. Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

Treatment  of  cystic  fibrosis  requires  a  multidisciplinary  approach.  With  regard  to  the  pulmonary management,  the  mainstay  being  inhaled  and  systemic  antibiotics  to  prevent  or  treat  pulmonary infections, and therapy with mucoactive drugs to improve airway mucosal clearance of lower-airway secretions and treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Inhaled  mannitol  was  developed  as  mucus  rehydrating  drug  for  the  treatment  of  cystic  fibrosis. However, the two pivotal studies failed to demonstrate robust evidence of efficacy. In particular, the large drop out in study DPM-CF-301 limits the confidence in the effect size seen, which in any case was of  questionable  clinical  relevance.  Study  DPM-CF-302  was  essentially  a  failed  study  as  statistical significance in the primary endpoint was not achieved using the pre-specified analysis. Furthermore, in this study the results were inconsistent across the age groups with little or no effect in adolescents and not consistent with the findings in study DPM-CF-301. Therefore there is considerable uncertainty on the robustness of the results seen in the two pivotal studies.

The  applicant  initially  claimed  the  use  of  the  product  also  in  the  paediatric  population,  but  has subsequently restricted the use in adults only given the concerns expressed by the CHMP about the available data below the age of 18 years. With regard to the use with or without rhDNase as claimed by the applicant, i.e. add-on therapy to rhDNase, and in adults ineligible, intolerant, or inadequately responsive to rhDNase, the available evidence is considered insufficient and inconsistent.

Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the limited efficacy is considered not to outweigh the observed and potential safety concerns, relating primarily to bronchoconstriction events and haemoptysis, such that a favourable benefit-risk cannot be concluded.

Some CHMP members expressed  a  divergent  view  stating  that  available  clinical  data  from  the  two pivotal  studies  show  an  effect  on  FEV 1 which  is  small  but  nevertheless  considered  to  be  of  clinical relevance. This particularly because the product is complementary to existing expectorant treatments due  to its  mechanism  of  action hence  providing  an  alternative  treatment  in  a  complex  and individualised  treatment  strategy.  The  remaining  uncertainties  with  respect  to  the  magnitude  of  the effect  are  accepted  in  this  context.  The  principal  adverse  events  associated  with  its  use,  cough  and minor  haemoptysis  may  be  considered  as  tolerability  rather  than  safety  problems  and  are  not  a sufficient ground to refuse an authorisation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Recommendations

## 4.1. Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy for Bronchitol in the treatment of cystic  fibrosis,  the  CHMP  considered  by  majority  decision  that  the  efficacy  of  the  above  mentioned medicinal product was not sufficiently demonstrated, and, therefore recommended the refusal of the granting  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  for  the  above  mentioned  medicinal  product.  The  CHMP considered that:

The pivotal studies (DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302) are considered not to provide adequate evidence of efficacy in the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in adults aged 18 years and above as an add-on therapy to rhDNase, and in adults ineligible, intolerant, or inadequately responsive to rhDNase. In particular:

-  The clinical relevance of the treatment effects observed on FEV1 has not been established.
-  Uncertainties remain in the magnitude of the effect following treatment with Bronchitol. In study DPM-CF-301  a  high  proportion  of  patient  withdrawals  complicates  inference.  The  pattern  of estimated treatment effects is inconsistent within each study across important subgroups defined by  age  (children,  adolescents  and  adults)  and  the  pattern  of  effects in  each  age  group  is inconsistent between studies. In light of the limited effects observed, these internal inconsistencies  result  in  unacceptable  uncertainty  in  the  estimated  treatment  effect  for  the proposed population.

The limited efficacy, of uncertain magnitude, is considered not to outweigh the observed and potential safety  concerns,  relating  primarily  to  bronchoconstriction  events  and  haemoptysis,  such  that a favourable benefit-risk cannot be concluded.

Due  to  the  aforementioned  concerns  a  satisfactory  summary  of  product  characteristics,  labelling, package leaflet, risk management plan and conditions to address other concerns as outlined in the list of outstanding issues cannot be agreed at this stage.

## 4.2. Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 23 June 2011

Following  the  CHMP  conclusion  that  Bronchitol  was  not  approvable  for  the  following  indication: 'Treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in adults aged 18 years and above as an add-on therapy to rhDNase, and in  adults  ineligible,  intolerant,  or  inadequately  responsive  to  rhDNase' ,  the  applicant  submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of the grounds for refusal on 19 August 2011.

Following a request from the applicant at the time of the re-examination, the CHMP convened an adhoc  expert  meeting  on  3  October  2011  inviting  the  experts,  including  patients  representatives,  to provide  their  views  on  the  questions  posed  by  the  CHMP  in  relation  to  the  marketing  authorisation application, taking into account the applicant's response to the grounds for refusal.

The applicant presented their detailed grounds for re-examination in writing and at an oral explanation to the CHMP on 17th October 2011.

## 4.2.1. Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Ground 1: The clinical relevance of the treatment effects observed on FEV 1 has not been established.

## Applicant´s position: (summarised)

The  applicant  provided  the  following  evidence  to  support  the  clinical  relevance  of  Bronchitol's treatment effects:

-  The clinical relevance of the FEV 1 benefit noted in both pivotal studies in the overall population and across age subgroups is supported by expert opinion.
-  A sustained FEV1 benefit observed with Bronchitol is highly meaningful in the context of declining lung function in CF
-  Bronchitol's size of effect in FEV 1 is comparable to existing CF therapies
-  Secondary  endpoints  all  support  the  primary  FEV 1 including  significant  improvements  in  FVC, increased mucus clearance and reductions in exacerbations.

Although the last proposed indication at the time of the re-examination was for adults only, as the CHMP had concerns regarding restriction of the indication, overall population data was presented in the following sections alongside both age and rhDNase subgroup data.

## Estimated Treatment Effect size

In the grounds for refusal the magnitude of the treatment effect obtained using Bronchitol has been questioned, rather than an absence of treatment effect. The uncertainty of exact treatment effect size then led to difficulty in determining clinical relevance

Data presented in the following sections was generated using the mixed model analysis of repeated measures  as  the  estimate  of  Bronchitol's  efficacy  from  this  statistical  analysis  plan  (SAP)  defined primary model. It is representative of a number of sensitivity analyses performed to take into account missing  data  due  to  withdrawals.  It  is  also  supported  using  analyses  based  on  last  and  baseline observation carried forward (LOCF &amp; BOCF), as requested by CHMP.

The  treatment  effects  estimated  by  MMRM  model  from  both  studies  are  consistent  with  those estimated based on cross-sectional analysis (ANCOVA) of Week 26 data, which are imputed by LOCF or BOCF as requested by CHMP. All age and rhDNase subgroups from both studies provide estimates of treatment effect which consistently favour Bronchitol. The overlap of the 95% CIs among all subgroups is  substantial,  which  indicates  that  there  is  no  statistical  evidence  to  support  the  concept  that  the treatment effects are not consistent across the subgroups.

The results consistently demonstrate Bronchitol's benefit on top of current standard of care (including rhDNase) in this orphan designated indication. The adult population similarly showed benefit in both the rhDNase user and rhDNase unsuitable subgroups. The observed relatively larger variation among children and adolescents subgroups is what would be expected with the small sample sizes included in these subgroups and expected sampling variation.

Both studies were designed to assess the treatment effect for the overall population and in light of the evidence above, Pharmaxis believe that the overall treatment effect of around 3.6% relative change in % predicted for both studies is representative of the best estimate of treatment effect for all subgroups in these studies.

## Sustained FEV1 benefit observed with Bronchitol

Another  important  component  of  the  clinical  relevance  of  Bronchitol's  efficacy  is  that  it  has  been demonstrated to be sustained out to 52 weeks in both pivotal studies. The FEV1 change (in relative % predicted) in those patients who entered the open label phase of both pivotal studies was plotted over time to show a sustained improvement for the Bronchitol arm across 52 weeks (Figure 4).

Although the change in FEV1 in the Bronchitol arm decreases from 26 to 52 weeks in both studies, the change in FEV1 at week 52 is still well above 0 demonstrating the sustained improvement in FEV1 over time. This is despite the predicted decline over one year expected in a CF population.

## Comparison of Bronchitol's size of effect in FEV 1 to existing CF therapies

Further evidence of the clinical relevance of Bronchitol's effect is provided when it is compared with other CF therapies currently used in the EU. The pooled effect of Bronchitol by change from baseline from both studies was comparable with rhDNase, and larger than that reported for hypertonic saline (HS) (Table 2).

Although  inhaled  antibiotics  are  less  appropriate  comparators,  due  to  their  antibacterial  mode  of action,  these  have been included here to demonstrate the variability in the FEV1 benefit noted with tobramycin.  When  the  original  studies  were  performed  large  FEV 1 benefits  (12%)  were  noted  as patients  were  naive  to  treatment  for P.  Aeruginosa ,  whereas  recent  studies,  which  are  more representative of how CF patients are currently treated, have shown more modest FEV1 improvements (2.6%). More recent trials of inhaled aztreonam have examined only the first month of drug, when benefit may be most apparent. This is in contrast to Bronchitol which has shown continued benefit out to 52 weeks.

## Secondary Endpoints Support FEV1 Improvement

## Improvement in other spirometry measures

An increase in FVC reflects increased opening of airways as a result of the clearing of distal airway mucus blocking, and reduced air trapping behind this mucus. The tidal volume is also increased as a result, so potentially improving exercise capacity. The secondary endpoint of FVC (relative change in % predicted)  from  both  pivotal  studies  and  pooled  data  supports  the  primary  endpoint  of  FEV 1 .  Both DPM-CF-301 and 302 showed statistically significant improvements of 3.03% (95% CI: 0.76, 5.29) and 3.07%  (95%  CI:  0.48,  5.66)  relative  change  in  %  predicted  FVC  respectively  compared  to  control across 26 weeks of treatment in the overall ITT population. Pooled data of both studies also showed an improvement of 3.00% (95% CI: 1.27, 4.74) relative change in % predicted. The FVC improvements correlate with FEV1  changes,  indicating that an improved  lung  capacity  is driving the FEV1 improvement.

## Quantitative Microbiology

rage bacterial burden from 6.9 to 4 log units (CFU/g) (from 7,943,282 CFU/g to 2,511,886 CFU/g). In study DPM-CF-302 based on quantitative microbiological results, Bronchitol treatment was shown to both reduce the incidence of P. aeruginosa infection and reduce the bacterial burden in those that were infected. The incidence of P. aeruginosa infection was 52.9% at baseline and 58.2% after 26 weeks on treatment in control patients, with the average bacterial burden in infected patients increasing from 6.1 to 6.3 log units (CFU/g). In contrast the incidence of infection fell over 26 weeks of treatment in the Bronchitol group from 48.1% to 41.5%, with a reduction in ave 6.

## Reduction in exacerbations

Exacerbation  prevention  is  an  important  goal  of  CF  therapy.  Not  only  do  exacerbations  carry  an immediate morbidity and mortality risk, but they have also been shown to lead to permanent declines in lung function. Exacerbations are relatively uncommon events so although clinically very important, are  not  a  sensitive  tool.  Therefore  exacerbation  was  included  as  a  secondary  variable,  but  the individual studies were not powered to test this endpoint. The larger population provided by the pooled data  is  therefore  of  particular  importance.  It  was  consistently  observed  that,  compared  with  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

control,  Bronchitol  was  associated  with  a  reduction  in  pulmonary  exacerbations,  antibiotic  use  and hospitalisations. In the pooled studies, the incidence of exacerbations and associated rescue antibiotic use was reduced by 29% (relative risk 0.71, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.98, p=0.039) and 30% (relative risk 0.70, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.97, p=0.033), respectively in the Bronchitol group compared with control. This reduction in incidence is considered to be clinically meaningful, and similar to the reductions originally reported using rhDNase, at a time when other concomitant therapies were not available. The reduction in exacerbations was supported by trends in reduced hospitalisations (relative risk 0.78, 95% CI: 0.53, .16). These findings are generally consistent with the findings in the individual studies (Table 5). 1

## Applicant´s position: (summarised)

In order to address the concerns regarding magnitude of effect size which were raised during the MAA assessment,  the  Applicant  presented  FEV 1 as  relative  change  in  %  predicted.  This  is  stated  by  the CHMP as the preferred endpoint.

## Uncertainty Associated with Patient Withdrawal and Use of MMRM Model

While acknowledging that there is a treatment effect with Bronchitol, the CHMP stated in the grounds for  refusal  that  'uncertainties  remain  in  the  magnitude  of  the  effect  following  treatment  with Bronchitol'. These uncertainties arose due to a relatively higher than expected patient withdrawal rate, and the use of MMRM model and possible different effects in different subgroups.

nchitol:  89.8%,  control:  95.8%)  who  contributed  at  least  one  postData from at least 90% of the patients contributed to the estimation of treatment effect. Although the overall  withdrawal  rate  was  higher  than  anticipated  in  study  DPM-CF-301,  there  is  a  significant proportion  of  the  subjects  (Bro baseline observation (Table 6).

This  is  similar  to  Study  DPM-CF-302,  where  96.2%  of  Bronchitol  subjects  and  99.2%  of  control subjects provided at least one post-baseline observation. The overall withdrawal rate underestimates

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the amount of data included in the primary analysis, thus could over emphasize the potential impact of the withdrawals.

As pointed out by CHMP and acknowledged by the applicant, the MMRM model could be associated with uncertainty in the estimation of the treatment effect, and missing data could further complicate the inference. In light of this, in order to assess the sensitivity of the primary analysis, missing data were imputed  by various methods  including last observation carried forward (LOCF) and baseline observation carried forward as requested by CHMP. The data were subsequently analyzed by Analysis of  Covariance  (cross-sectional  analysis  at  Week  26)  or  MMRM  (longitudinal  analysis  across  the treatment period), to compare results with those from the primary analysis which were 3.51% (95% CI:  0.96,  6.06)  and  3.59%  (95%  CI:  0.29,  6.90)  respectively  for  studies  DPM-CF-301  and  302. possibly different missing mechanisms. Comprehensive and systematic sensitivity analyses focused on the most relevant methods and results were reported to address approaches were used to handle the missing data for the relative change In this section, the following in % of predicted FEV1:

## CHMP requested methods:

- LOCF: missing data at Week 26 were imputed by last observation carried forward. This is likely to be conservative  in  DPM-CF-301,  particularly  because  -  as  recognized  by  CHMP  -  patients  tended  to withdraw  earlier  from  the  Bronchitol  arm  than  the  control  arm.  Hence,  early  withdrawals  are  more likely  to  have  only  minimal  improvement  from  baseline.  The  imputed  Week  26  data  were  then analyzed by Analysis of Covariance.
- e imputed by baseline observation carried forward. This will also e  conservative  in  DPM-CF-301,  but  possibly  even  more  so  than  LOCF.  The  imputed  Week  26  data COVA. · BOCF: missing data at Week 26 wer b were then analyzed by AN

## Other methods:

- MI: missing data across the treatment period, namely Week 6 to Week 26, were imputed by multiple imputation (MI) for 50 times. Each imputed longitudinal dataset was then analyzed by MMRM model. Finally  the  MMRM  estimates  of  the  50  imputed  datasets  were  combined  for  inference  following  the approach as reported by Rubin.
- Pattern Mixture Model (via Multiple Imputation): missing data across the treatment period, namely Week 6 to Week 26, were first imputed by multiple imputation for 50 times. Then a further penalty was given to patients with multiple missing data, as these patients could less likely benefit from the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment.  That  is  20mL  was  removed  per  missing  visit  (20mL  at  1st issing  visit,  and  60mL  at  3rd  missing  visit).  The  impute missing  visit,  40mL  at  2nd d longitudinal  data  were  then  analyzed  by MMRM model as above. m

ANCOV A: cross=sectional analysis at Week 26, MMRM: longitudinal analysis for all treatment period

<!-- image -->

It has been acknowledged by both CHMP and the applicant that no single correct way to impute the missing data exists. Therefore the above sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainty associated  with  the  estimates  from  the  primary  analysis  using  MMRM  model.  As  mentioned  above, LOCF and BOCF were requested by CHMP to be used to impute the missing data at Week 26, and then ANCOVA  was  used  to  analyse  the  imputed  data  at  Week  26  cross-sectionally.  Though  not  directly comparable between the longitudinal analysis (MMRM) and the cross-sectional analysis (ANCOVA), for both studies DPM-CF-301 and 302, the results based on LOCF (ANCOVA) and BOCF (ANCOVA) give similar estimates of effect size (of the order of 3% for study DPM-CF-301 and 4% for study DPM-CF302).  LOCF  and  BOCF do, however, still lead to the same  conclusion as that based on  the primary analysis  (MMRM).  Their  results  indicate  that,  at  Week  26,  there  was  a  positive  effect  favouring Bronchitol for the comparison between Bronchitol versus control. Much of the uncertainty associated with the estimates from MMRM arises from possibly inappropriate assumptions of the MMRM model; the results based on LOCF (ANCOVA) and BOCF (ANCOVA) should alleviate those concerns.

er Multiple  imputation  and  pattern  mixture  model  (via  MI)  were  also  used  to  account  for  the  possible missing mechanisms in the data such as missing at random (MAR) or not missing at random (NMAR), which  unfortunately  cannot  be  directly  tested  or  verified.  As  the  imputed  data  were  subsequently analysed by MMRM, the results are provided for reference purpose only. The imputation by MI and Pattern Mixture (via MI) introduced extra variation into the data to account for the uncertainty due to the imputation of missing data. Therefore, it is expected that their 95% CIs will be wider than oth estimates. However, this is less applicable to DPM-CF-302, as the quantity of missing data for DPM-CF-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

302 is far less than that for DPM-CF-301. Even with the presence of all these uncertainties mentioned above, the results based on MI and Pattern Mixture (via MI) still favour Bronchitol.

In summary, the applicant accepts the concern raised by CHMP with regards to the estimates based on the primary analysis using MMRM model. The withdrawals in both studies could further complicate the inference  based  on  MMRM  model.  The  applicant  followed  the  analysis  approaches  requested  by  the CHMP - i.e.  that  the  missing  data  at  Week  26  should  be  imputed  by  LOCF  or  BOCF,  and  the  data subsequently analysed by ANCOVA cross-sectionally. The methods recommended by the CHMP lead to e same conclusion as that from the primary analysis, which indicate that the treatment is effective nty  associated  with  the highly dependent on the th and  that  this  conclusion  is  reliable  even  with  the  presence  of  the  uncertai primary analysis. The evidence for the presence of the treatment effect is not selected analysis methods.

A  further  CHMP  concern  regarding  the  magnitude  of  Bronchitol's  effect  was  that  'the  pattern  of estimated treatment effects is inconsistent within each study across important subgroups defined by age  (children,  adolescents  and  adults)  and  the  pattern  of  effects  in  each  age  group  is  inconsistent between studies'.

n each subgroup alone, while there is uncertainty of these estimates. Therefore, the age subgroup data are plotted as a forest plot for initial visual inspection. The forest plot for the treatment effects of the three age subgroups in each of the two  studies  (DPM-CF-301  and  302)  was  presented  by  the  applicant  showing  the  actual  number  of patients used in the estimation of treatment effect (Figure 11). In an effort to demonstrate the consistency of the treatment effects across subgroups and studies, the applicant stated that the treatment effect as measured by the relative change in % of predicted FEV1 was estimated for the age subgroups for both DPM-CF-301 and 302 studies, based on the estimates from the primary analysis using MMRM model. It is acknowledged that heterogeneity should not be claimed on the basis of the observed treatment-effect sizes withi

To further address the concern of the uncertainty associated with the MMRM estimates, the applicant mputed by LOCF or presented the subgroup estimates based on the ANCOVA analysis of Week 26 data i BOCF.

More importantly, all the point estimates are well above unity of 0, except for the children in study DPM-CF-301 and adolescents in study DPM-CF-302. Due to the overlap in the 95% CIs among the subgroups, it should not be concluded that the effect of Bronchito 301 or adolescents in study DPM-CF-302 are different from other subgroups. Th larger uncertainty in the estimated treatment effects for these subgroups.

reatment effects estimated mong the subgroups are independent of the analysis methods. The patterns of the treatment effects for all subgroups, regardless of the imputation methods (LOCF or BOCF) are very similar to those observed in Figure 11. The treatment effects among the age subgroups all consistently favour Bronchitol. Therefore, it can be concluded that the t a

In general, in the presence of an overall effect, real (as opposed to simply observed) discrepancies in subgroups are rare. When such discrepancies are seen, a usual approach to understanding whether or not they are real is to look at other studies and see if the discrepancy is replicated. Neither of the apparent discrepancies (the children in study DPM-CF-301 or the adolescents in study DPM-CF-302) is replicated  in  the  complimentary  study.  Based  on  visual  inspection  of  the  forest  plots,  it  should  be concluded that the treatment effects in all age subgroups are largely consistent, and the pattern of treatment effects predominantly favours Bronchitol.

## Statistical Assessment of Uniformity of Treatment Effects among Age Subgroups

## Interaction Test

To formally assess whether the treatment effect is consistent across the age subgroups within each tudy,  the  interaction  between  treatment  and  age  groups  was  tested  for  each  of  the  studies.  The mary of Clinical Efficacy are extracted as follows: s results from the Sum

-  DPM-CF-301: interaction between treatment and age group, p-value=0.551
-  DPM-CF-302: interaction between treatment and age group, p-value=0.384

The above analyses were based on MMRM model. The interaction between treatment and age group has  also  been  assessed  by  using  ANCOVA  to  analyse  Week  26  data  imputed  by  LOCF  or  BOCF,  as requested by CHMP. The p-values of these interaction tests are as follows:

| ImputationMethod   | P-value of Interaction Between Treatment and Age Group(ANCOVA)   | P-value of Interaction Between Treatment and Age Group(ANCOVA)   |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                    | DPM-CF-301                                                       | DPM-CF-302                                                       |
| LOCF               | 0.656                                                            | 0.392                                                            |
| BOCF               | 0.440                                                            | 0.496                                                            |

The interaction  test  takes  into  account  the  point  estimate  of  the  treatment  effect  and  the  variation homogeneous treatment effect, regardless of the data or statistical models used. associated with the estimates. It is acknowledged that the interaction test might suffer from the small sample size in each subgroup, and accordingly the test might not identify a true interaction due to lack of power. Therefore, despite the general agreement that an insignificant test result does not exclude the possibility  of  true  interaction,  nevertheless  an  insignificant  interaction  does  not  support  that  the treatment  effect  is  heterogeneous  across  the  age  subgroups.  The  evidence  from  interaction  tests supports a

## Heterogeneity test

To further assess if there is heterogeneity of treatment effects across the studies and age subgroups, a heterogeneity test as proposed by Cochran (1954) was used, following the meta-analysis approach.

rately),  a  minor  violation  of  this  assumption  should  not  invalidate  the  test.  Therefore,  age It is assumed that the treatment effects estimated from each subgroup are independent. Though this assumption is not strictly  true  in  this  case  (as  subgroup  data  were  collected  within  the  two  studies sepa subgroups from both studies are used for the heterogeneity test. The p-values for the heterogeneity test are 0.715, 0.558 and 0.682 respectively for LOCF, BOCF and the primary analysis. Although the heterogeneity test (like the interaction test) suffers from a small sample size (six subgroups in this case), there is no evidence to support an assertion that the treatment effect is not consistent across the studies and age groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Normal Quantile Plot

The question of whether the underlying treatment effects from each age group can all be considered as being  drawn  from  the  same  (single)  population  or  from  heterogeneous  populations  can  be  further explored  with  a  normal  quantile  plot.  In  this  method  a  standardised  treatment  effect  (z-score)  is calculated for each age group in each study. The standardised treatment effect is equal to the point estimate divided by the standard error of the estimate, so takes into account the uncertainty of the estimate.

Wang and Bushman (1998) show how a normal quantile plot can be used to assess whether subgroups are  all  from  one  population,  or  not.  Each  standardized  effect-size  estimate  should  have  a  standard deviation of 1. If the subgroups do all come from the same population, then the distribution of effect size estimates will be approximately normal. Thus, the plotted line in the normal quantile plot for the age subgroup data should be straight and should have a slope close to 1. If the slope is substantially less than one, this indicates unusually little variability between subgroups - a fact that in itself would be unexpected. The normal quantile plots for each of the missing data methods are reported in Figure 14.

For each of the different methods, all the observed standardised treatment effects fall within their 95% confidence  bands  and  are  close  to  their  respective  straight  line.  In  all  cases  the  mean  of  the standardised treatment effects is well above 0 (0 would indicate no treatment effect). The slopes of the regression  line  for  LOCF  and  BOCF  are  less  than  1  (both  are  approximately  0.81),  as  expected, because  these  two  methods  could  reduce  the  variation  in  the  data  when  change  from  baseline  is calculated. The slope for the primary analysis is 1.03. Thus, it can be concluded that the treatment effects across the studies and age subgroups are from the same population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Finally,  a  simulation  has  been  conducted  to  further  explore  whether  or  not  the  observed  treatment effects  among  the  six  subgroups  are  from  the  same  population.  The  mean  (standard  error)  for  the relative change in % of predicted FEV1 was estimated to be 5.81 (0.78) and 2.26 (0.89) respectively for the Bronchitol and control groups, based on the MMRM analysis of the combined data. Individual patient data for  each  age  group were  drawn  randomly  from  populations  with  the following distributions:

Bronchitol Normal (mean=5.81, standard deviation=0.78 √ 361)

Control Normal (mean=2.26, standard deviation=0.89 √ 239), where  361  and  239  were  the  sample  sizes  for  the  Bronchitol  and  control  groups,  respectively,  as reported in the combined studies. This generates samples assuming that all the age groups have the same underlying mean effect. In each sampling, the same number of patients as that reported in the studies was randomly drawn for each age subgroup. The treatment effect within each age subgroup and the range of the treatment effect (max minus min) among the six subgroups were calculated for each  sampling.  This  process  was  repeated  10000  times.  The  observed  range  of  treatment  effects among the age subgroup in the trials is approximately 5.71 (6.13-0.42, Figure 11), which falls within the 10% and 90% percentiles of the simulation distribution. This shows that effect sizes as divergent as those seen, even when the true underlying effect size is the same in all subgroups, is wholly to be expected. Thus, this further supports the assertion that the treatment effects among the six subgroups are from the same population.

In  summary,  although  each  single  piece  of  evidence  alone  cannot  be  considered  conclusive,  the combined evidence from the forest plots, interaction tests, the heterogeneity tests, the normal quantile plots  and  the  simulations  do  not  support  the  conclusion  that  the  treatment  effect  is  not  the  same across studies and age groups. It is therefore concluded that the observed variation is due to expected sampling  variation  rather  than  true  differences.  All  the  evidence  collectively  supports  that  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment effects are consistent across the studies and subgroups. Further, this supports the statistical validity of combining the two study populations for analysis.

## Assessing Possible Control Effect in Children and Adolescent Subgroups

As  evidenced  in  the  previous  section,  the  variation  noted  in  treatment  effect  estimates  between subgroups and across studies is consistent with expected sampling variation.

When  looking  at  the  Bronchitol  arm,  there  is  consistently  a  significant  improvement  within  all  age subgroups across both studies showing a ≥ 4% relative change from baseline in % predicted FEV1.

However, it is acknowledged that there does appear to be more variation in the control effect (Figure 16).  Control in  both  pivotal  studies  comprised  50mg  b.i.d.  of  respirable  mannitol.  Notably  the  adult subgroup which was the subject of the CHMP opinion did not show any control effect in either study, whereas there was a suggestion of a control effect in the younger age groups.

In the first pivotal study, DPM-CF-301, there was a suggestion that there may have been an effect at the  lower  dose  in  children  (possibly  due  to  their  smaller  lung  size).  However,  when  children  and adolescents receiving control in DPM-CF-301 were examined by FEV1 improvement against height (a surrogate for lung volume), no relationship was seen. This lack of correlation was supported by DPMCF-302 data, where children showed a meaningful effect versus control, but adolescents did not. The earlier phase II, two week dosing studies did not show efficacy in children or adolescents at a dose of 40 mg b.i.d.

anations  are  possible.  There  are  a  number  of dditional hypotheses which could contribute to this type of control effect. The more variable control response in children and adolescents is consistent with sampling variation alone  but  the  applicant  acknowledges  that  other  expl a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Firstly, it is known that CF management in adolescents can be particularly erratic, although study drug  compliance  appeared  to  be  similar  between  Bronchitol  and  Control  arms  in  all  age  groups (Children - 86.5 vs 87.3%, Adolescents - 80.1 vs 83.0%, Adults - 78.3 vs 82.2% respectively). However,  improved  compliance  in  pre-existing  therapy  due  to  study  participation  could  be contributing.
- hat the 50mg control dose was subtherapeutic e  Secondly, although study DPM-CF-202 suggested t in all ages, som effect in young patients over a longer time course cannot be excluded, and only a study in children and adolescents performed using non-respirable rather than respirable mannitol as placebo might confirm this. If the control did have an effect, then the effect size in patients under 18 would be an underestimation.
-  Lastly,  a  control  effect  may  be  more  apparent  in  children  because  of  their  inherent  difficulty  in initiating  an  effective,  productive  cough  at  will,  to  assist  mucus  clearance.  As  both  doses  of mannitol provoke some cough, this may have been more impactful in children, despite this being secondary to the main MCC mechanism of action.

pivotal  study  there  were  large  differences  in  the  placebo  arm  of  children  compared  to adolescents (Ramsey et al, 1999). Apparent  treatment  differences  by  age  in  cystic  fibrosis  are  not  unique  to  Bronchitol,  and  in  a tobramycin

It is also interesting to note that in studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302 when patients switched to control treatment an improvement in FEV1 was noted during Bronchitol treatment after 26 weeks of the subsequent 6 months during the open label phase.

The increase in FEV1 attained in the Bronchitol treated ex-control arm in the open label phase is similar to  the  level  of  improvement  noted  with  the  Bronchitol  arm  in  the  double  blind  phase.  This  strongly suggests  that  control  patients  have  not  achieved  maximal  FEV 1 benefits  on  control  and  provides further evidence of Bronchitol's effectiveness.

regardless of which analyses  model  is  used  Bronchitol  provides  clear  FEV improvement.  This  is  further  confirmed  by In summary, Bronchitol's magnitude of effect can be determined with sufficient certainty to confirm it is clinically meaningful. It has been shown that the effect size provided by the DPM-CF-301 study has not been overestimated to any meaningful extent despite patient withdrawals, and 1 sensitivity analyses. There is no statistical evidence of internal inconsistencies amongst age groups or between studies, as the variability is consistent with expected sampling variation within this CF patient population.

## CHMP position on grounds 1 and 2

The  main  studies  in  support  of  this  application  are  studies  DPM-CF-301  and  DPM-CF-302,  which included  children,  adolescents,  and  adults  and  used  absolute  change  from  baseline  in  lung  function (FEV ) as the primary efficacy variable. Mean (SD) baseline FEV percent predicted in study DPM-CF301 (safety population, N= 295) was 62.4 (SD:16.45) and 61.4 (SD:16.13) in the mannitol and control groups, respectively. These figures for study DPM-CF-302 (N=305) are as follows: 65.24 (SD:13.90) and 64.35 (SD:15.29). In study DPM-CF-301 64.4 % of the patient population were adults while in study  DPM-CF-302 this figure  was  49.5%.  Fifty  five  %  of  patients  were  receiving  rhDNase  in  study DPM-CF-301 while in study DPM-CF-302 this number was 75%. The percentage of patients receiving inhaled antibiotics was 55% in study DPM-CF-301 and 56% in study DPM-CF-302. 1 1

During  the  initial  evaluation  procedure,  the  CHMP  raised  a  number  of  concerns  regarding  the methodology, conduct and interpretation of the two pivotal trials. The concerns remaining at the end of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

According to the study reports of studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302, the number of subjects with at least  one  protocol  defined  pulmonary  exacerbation  (PDPE,  defined  by  the  presence  of  at  least  4 symptoms and signs plus the use of intravenous antibiotics) was 18.1% in the mannitol arm and 28% in the control arm in study DPM-CF-301 (ITT population). In study DPM-CF-302 15.2% of the subjects in  the  mannitol arm and 19% of the subjects in the control had a PDPE. The PDPE mean (SD) rate (events per subject per year) was 0.78 (1.976) in the mannitol group and 1.05 (2.148) events per subject per year (rate ratio [95% CI] 0.74 [0.47, 1.18]). In study DPM-CF-302 the rate ratio [95% CI] was 0.85, [0.51, 1.41]. This is consistent with a reduction in the incidence of PDPE in the mannitol arms by approximately 25% in study DPM-CF-301 and by 15% in study DPM-CF-302. However, a sixmonth  period  of  treatment  is  not  sufficiently  lengthy  as  to  permit  an  adequate  assessment  of  this variable.

unds for refusal, the results are discussed as the relative change The change in FEV1 can be measured as the absolute change from baseline (in litres), the relative change (as percent change from baseline), or the absolute change in percent predicted FEV1. While the predefined primary endpoint in the two phase 3 pivotal studies is the change from baseline in FEV1 (mL) in the response to the CHMP gro in FEV1 predicted of normal. This is also in line with the expert group's position received. They noted that the assessment based on relative % predicted change is better than the use of absolute change in mL, the latter being not considered appropriate for the study. However, the experts also noted that the absolute % predicted change would have been even better and this was endorsed by the CHMP.

neral, a comparison against antibiotics has limitations. Based on the It is not controversial that the effect size for FEV1 observed in studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302, which  investigated  the  dose  of  400  mg  bid,  is  small.  Overall  treatment  with  mannitol  showed  an improvement  of  approximately  2-3%  compared  with  the  control  group  over  26  weeks  in  terms  of percent predicted FEV1. The clinical relevance of such a marginal effect size needs to be established in the overall context of CF management and prognosis. The experts group confirmed that benchmarking for  a  product  impacting  on  sputum  clearance  like  inhaled  mannitol  would  need  to  consider  the respective mode of action. In ge expected effect on the volume of liquid on the airway surface it would appear that nebulised hypertonic saline (HS) seems the medicinal product most closely related to inhaled mannitol; however the use of nebulised HS in cystic fibrosis is not an approved therapy and all the evidence for the use of nebulised HS in patients with CF is limited to published studies. This view was shared by the expert group and subsequently endorsed by the CHMP.

reed that in the overall treatment approach for cystic The expert group confirmed that the effect size observed with inhaled mannitol is small and based on the  available  data  it  is  difficult  to  ascertain  whether  the  treatment  effect  is  clinically  relevant. Nevertheless the expert group unanimously ag fibrosis patients any improvement in lung function can be of relevance in an individual patient given the deterioration of FEV1 inherent to the disease progression. Since the lung function is progressively declining in cystic fibrosis patients over time, any intervention that slightly improves lung function can be  of  relevance  for  the  long-term  management  of  these  patients  in  clinical  practice.  The  CHMP accepted the experts' opinion that even the small improvement in lung function that was observed on average across the population included in the clinical trials, which might normally not be detectable in an individual patient in clinical practice, is of clinical importance to cystic fibrosis patients where lung function deteriorates over time.

Another issue raised by the CHMP was the heterogeneity between and within studies with respect to benefit  on  lung  function.  While  study  DMP-CF-301  showed  a  statistically  significant  benefit  for  FEV 1 (mL), study DPM-CF-302 did not, at least in terms of the primary analysis. Furthermore, there were differences in outcome for children, adolescents, and adults. The applicant has presented a number of statistical analyses to address the internal inconsistency observed in the pattern of effect across age groups  and  between  studies.  The  limitations  of  any  such  approach  have  been  acknowledged.    It  is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concluded that the inconsistencies seen in subgroups can be attributed to the inherent variability and to the fact that the overall effect size is small.

Based  on  the  available  data,  any  such  effect  can  only  be  considered  demonstrated  in  the  adult population. In studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302 relative % predicted FEV1 compared to control in children (6-11 years) was improved by 0.44% (95% CI -5.90, 6.77, N=43) and 6.1% (95% CI -1.28, 13.54, N=59) over 26 weeks (p=0.892 and 0.104) respectively. In adolescents (12-17 years) relative change in % predicted FEV1 compared to control improved by 3.31% (95% CI -2.29, 8.90, N=55) and 0.42% (95% CI -5.45, 6.29, N=94) over 26 weeks (p=0.245 and 0.888) respectively. In principle it is not  expected  that  efficacy  differs  between  children/adolescents  and  adults;  however,  the  data  from studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302 do not support this. Particularly the results in adolescents were patients. Taking the above information into account, the CHMP concludes that the studies considered surprising by the expert group from a clinical perspective as this is the patient population where normally benefits are clearly demonstrated, which seems not to be the case across both pivotal studies. The available data in children and adolescents does however not demonstrate the benefit of inhaled  mannitol  in  this  population.  During  the  evaluation  procedure  the  applicant  restricted  the applied indication to the use in adults. It is therefore considered appropriate to limit any use of inhaled mannitol to the adult population, given that the effect size in the adult population was similar in the two  pivotal  studies  and  that  this  effect  was  consistent  with  the  2  supportive  studies  all  showing  a similar  benefit  in  FEV 1 (for  both  Phase  III  studies  there  was  a  statistically  significant  benefit  in  the primary  efficacy  variable,  change  in  FEV 1 from  baseline  to  study  end,  for  Bronchitol  compared  to control treatment arms). This suggests that the benefit is real, and is unlikely to be an artefact of the subgroup analyses presented by age. In addition it is considered that the effect has been measured with acceptable precision, and it is recognised by the ad-hoc expert group cystic fibrosis experts and the  CHMP  to  be  small,  but  of  clinical  relevance.  Moreover,  the  differential  response  according  to patients'  age  may  be  due  to  clinical  trials  conducted  in  a  refractory  disease,  in  a  relatively  small number of are considered reliable.

Nevertheless, it is recognized that the main studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302 included children, adolescents,  and  adults,  thereby  the  overall  patient  population  relevant  for  the  condition  'cystic fibrosis'. Given the prevalence in individuals below the age of 18 years, treatment of this population is of particular relevance. Whilst this is the population for which a clinical benefit can be established, it remains paramount from a clinical perspective and for the benefit risk assessment of the use of inhaled mannitol in this condition to further investigate the efficacy and safety of inhaled mannitol in children and  adolescents  with  cystic  fibrosis.  The  applicant  is  therefore  requested  as  a  condition  to  the marketing authorization to perform a study in this regard. A first draft synopsis was presented by the applicant  during  the  evaluation;  it  was  noted  that  it  would  be  important  to  assess  the  effect  of treatment by use of inhaled antibiotics, which are often used in an \"on cycle\" (4 weeks) and in an \"off cycle\"  (4  weeks),  and  that  the  duration  of  the  observation  period  would  need  to  account  for  such treatment regimen.  The study protocol shall be agreed with the CHMP prior to the start of the study and  the  final  results  provided  to  the  CHMP  and  EMA  by  June  2015.  The  submission  of  the  study protocol is envisaged for Q2 2012. It is highly recommended to obtain scientific advice for this study protocol.

rs and non-users was 3.21 (-0.61, 7.03) and 4.73 (It  was  also  raised  previously  that  the  differentiation  between  rhDNAse  users  and  non-users  has limitations due to the study design and the results obtained. In rhDNase users in study DPM-CF-301 the relative change in FEV1 % predicted from baseline across 26 weeks of treatment was  2.83 (95% CI -0.62, 6.27). For non-users the relative change was 4.30 (95% CI 0.53, 8.07). In study DPM-CF302 the relative change (95% CI) for rhDNase use 1.93,  11.40),  respectively.  It  needs  to  be  acknowledged  that  the  studies  were  not  powered  for  the analysis of these two subgroups. When experts were requested to provide their opinion on what would

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

constitute an adequate definition of patients intolerant to, or inadequately responsive to rhDNase, they stated  that  the  criteria  for  the subgroups  related  to  rhDNAse  users  and  non-users  were  not  prespecified  for  both  studies  which  rendered  the  interpretation  of  the  results  very  difficult.  Moreover, studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302 were not powered to make such stratifications. From a clinical perspective, the proposed distinction between rhDNAse users and non-users appeared difficult given the fact that although the effect size appears to e smaller in the rhDNase users, both rhDNase users and non-users can benefit from the addition of that in practice the (non-)use of rhDNAse is also subject to patient's choice, hence the definition of rhDNAse  non-users  appeared  not  appropriate.  Therefore,  to  overcome  this  obstacle  the  claimed indication was changed by the applicant to refer to the add-on therapy to best standard of care. This change was deemed acceptable by the CHMP in light of b mannitol to their treatment regime. The clinical experts from the ad hoc expert group highlighted that even a small effect size can be considered relevant. The data on FEV1 are given greater weight in the assessment than the QoL data, where the absence of effect is perhaps not surprising in light of the commonly accepted insensitivity of these scales.

These data supersede the rather equivocal and difficult to interpret data from phase II studies given that the phase III studies are larger and better reflect clinical practice since  both  rhDNAse  users  and  non-users  were  included.  The  CHMP  conclusion  is  that  the  effect  in rhDNAse users and non-users is established, that clinical benefit in both rhDNAse users and non-users is positive and that benefits in both groups are considered clinically relevant.

In conclusion, further to the assessment of the applicant's responses to the grounds for refusal the and to the advice provided by the ad-hoc expert group, the CHMP concluded that the grounds for refusal No. 1 and No. 2 had been adequately addressed.

## Applicant´s position: (summarised)

The overall AE incidence, including SAEs, was very similar between treatment groups, irrespective of age  group  or  concomitant  rhDNase  use.  The  remaining  safety  concerns  raised  in  the  grounds  for refusal  related  primarily  to  risks  of  bronchoconstriction  or  haemoptysis.  The  applicant  wanted  to with that expected in a CF be further allayed with the proposed SPC and RMP activities including close monitoring views of all demonstrate that the level of haemoptysis noted in pivotal studies is in line population  and  that  the  proposed  initiation  dose  assessment  and  prophylactic  bronchodilator  use adequately minimises the risk of bronchoconstriction. The applicant believes that both of these safety concerns can (with re-testing for bronchial hyper-reactivity after six weeks if indicated) and cumulative re adverse events associated with both of these AEs.

## s not a high risk Bronchospasm i

Inhaled mannitol is a known bronchoconstrictive agent, specifically in sensitive patients with bronchial hyper-responsiveness.  Because  of  this,  mandated  steps  were  introduced  to  minimize  risk  in  the Bronchitol  development  programme;  namely,  a  mannitol  tolerability  screening  test  (MTT)  to  detect reactive bronchoconstriction to mannitol, and prophylactic bronchodilator use prior to administration of mannitol.  While  it  is  true  that  acute  bronchoconstriction  can  potentially  occur  during  treatment  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

susceptible CF patients, the findings in the pivotal studies show bronchoconstriction is infrequent and if bronchoconstriction does occur, it is not severe, responds to treatment which is available to the patient (e.g. salbutamol), and is temporary.

The following issues raised by the CHMP were addressed by the applicant:

-  Bronchitol does not increase the incidence of bronchoconstriction in patients more likely to be at risk
-  Bronchitol does not increase the incidence of bronchoconstriction during exacerbations
-  The risk of bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) developing does not increase with chronic use of Bronchitol.

Wheeze  and  dyspnoea  are  features  of  airways  disease  in  cystic  fibrosis,  and  may  result  from ts  did  not  receive  pre-treatment bronchospasm  as  well  as  other  causes  of  airway  obstruction.  Obstructive  lung  disease  is  a  major source of disability in CF, and wheezing and exercise intolerance are commonly described. Although bronchial hyperreactivity may be present, in most patients the obstruction relates to excessive viscid secretions, inflammation of airway walls, and increased compressibility of airways during expiration. This contrasts with asthmatics, in whom bronchial hyper-reactivity leading to bronchoconstriction is the common factor. Because of this, Bronchitol would lead to a degree of bronchial narrowing in more than 80%  of  asthmatics  if  untreated  with  steroids  or  bronchodilators.  This  contrasts  with  an  earlier Bronchitol  study  in  cystic  fibrosis  (DPM-CF-202)  in  which  patien bronchodilator, 12% of these CF patients (6/52) had an FEV1 decrease exceeding 20% at screening. Furthermore, no fall exceeded 25%. In the two pivotal cystic fibrosis studies, in which pre-treatment bronchodilator was used, about 6% of patients failed a test of mannitol tolerability at screening.

A  risk  in  the  CF  population  is  therefore  recognized,  but  in  the  six  month  pivotal  studies  which mandated screening and prophylaxis, bronchospasm related events were infrequently reported and not severe in intensity.

Both events were considered treatment-related and both led to study discontinuation. One of these events was reported as an SAE; the patient was symptom free and recovered to baseline FEV1 within half an hour. He was an rhDNase non-user who had an FEV1 fall of 16% from baseline (21% from post-bronchodilator FEV1) after study drug at the time of first study drug administration. Notably  t medication. There were no other bronchoconstriction related SAEs.

Since wheeze,  chest  discomfort and  dyspnoea  are  signs  or  symptoms  that  can  result  from bronchoconstriction,  these  events  were  also  closely  examined  and  all  found  to  be  infrequent  in  the pooled Phase 3 data (Table 8). These have been grouped to the term 'bronchoconstriction related AEs' (although  such  AEs  might  also  result  from  other  causes).  In  the  overall  population  of  the  pooled studies there was a similar incidence of bronchoconstriction related AEs between arms with 6.1% on Bronchitol  vs  5.0%  on  control.  There  were  no  severe  bronchoconstriction  related  AE's  reported  in either study.

There were no trends for these AEs that suggest greater risk for any age group.

In  rhDNase  users,  the  incidence  of bronchoconstriction related AEs was 7.3% on Bronchitol, and 5.0% on control. In rhDNase non-users the incidence was 3.9% on Bronchitol and 3.8% on control. N

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

history of asthma was more common in Bronchitol than the control group (32.6% vs 20.1%), which would predict a higher incidence of bronchoconstriction related AE's in the Bronchitol arm during the studies.

## Bronchoconstriction risk comparable to expected background rate

The  incidence  of  bronchoconstriction  or  associated  events  is  similar  between  Bronchitol  and  control arms.  However,  the  CHMP  have  previously  raised  concerns  that  a  control  using  subtherapeutic mannitol might lead to an underestimation of difference between groups, even though incidence is low. The expected background of bronchoconstriction can also be estimated from the placebo arms of other CF studies, in particular when they are of similar length and disease severity. It should be noted that the  aztreonam  data  was  collected  over  4  weeks  whereas  6  month  data  is  presented  for  Bronchitol, tobramycin and rhDNase.

When Bronchitol is compared with studies using other inhaled CF agents (rhDNase, aztreonam, TOBI and  TIP),  the  incidence  of  dyspnoea,  wheeze,  chest  discomfort,  or  bronchospasm  events  on  ei er ronchitol (400 mg B.I.D.) or control (50 mg B.I.D.) did not exceed the background rates based on the th B placebo arms in other studies (shaded columns in Table 8).

In addition, Bronchitol, tobramycin and aztreonam trial data allowed comparison of acute falls in FEV1 immediately  after  study  drug  administration.  The  data  suggests  that  Bronchitol  results  in  a  lower incidence of significant acute FEV 1 falls than either tobramycin or aztreonam (Table 8).

In summary, the overall incidence of bronchoconstriction events does not suggest any increased risk of Bronchitol over control, and these rates are consistent with that expected in a CF population.

However, there were concerns that the prolonged use of Bronchitol, or particularly susceptible patients or disease exacerbations may increase the risk. Assessment of these issues did not show any evidence that these posed any particular risks for bronchoconstriction as summarised in the following sections.

## Bronchoconstriction events are not increased after long term treatment

1 If  the  sensitivity to bronchoconstriction increased with long term treatment, then acute falls in FEV 1 after Bronchitol administration would also be expected to increase over time. However, the FEV1 falls post  dose  at  the  early  study  visits  were  similar  to  those  observed  during  visits  after  26  weeks  of treatment. In the pooled studies, 246 patients could be analysed and the majority (135 (54.9%)) had a smaller fall in FEV1 after 26 weeks of treatment. Consistent with this, the overall mean falls in FEV

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

at each of these visits were similar. Thus, the data is not suggestive of increased bronchial reactivity after long term Bronchitol treatment.

As supportive evidence, similar results were seen when looking at bronchodilator reversibility at the beginning and end of the treatment period. Increasing reversibility over time to a bronchodilator might also  suggest  an  increase  in  BHR.  In  the  combined  studies,  7/246  (2.8%)  Bronchitol  patients  and 11/170 (6.5%) control patients changed from &lt; 12% reversibility to ≥ 12% reversibility in FEV1 from Week 0 to Week 26. In contrast, 12/246 (4.9%) Bronchitol patients and 1/170 (0.6%) control patients changed from ≥ 12% reversibility to &lt; 12% reversibility in FEV1 from Week 0 to Week 26. Thus falls in FEV1  after  drug  administration  and  reversibility  to  bronchodilator  shows  no  evidence  of  increased susceptibility to bronchoconstriction after long term use of Bronchitol.

## Bronchoconstriction events are not increased significantly during exacerbations

However, it was found that Patients with meaningful reactivity to mannitol at screening were excluded from the studi patient  group  continuing  with  therapy  did  not  then  exhibit  bronchial  reactivity  while  on  treatment.

ed exacerbations within a week of study visits. Falls in FEV1 in response to Bronchitol at the time of exacerbations (within 7 days) were examined, as a meaningful number of patients (N=64) experienc control group) did Only in five patients out of 58 (2 out of 30 in Bronchitol group and 3 out of 28 in FEV1  fall  more  than  10%  following  Bronchitol  or  control  drug  administration  at  the  time  of  an exacerbation. Falls of 10% are not considered excessive, thus only two patients (6.7%) experienced notable falls in FEV1 around the time of an exacerbation while on Bronchitol treatment. In no case did the fall exceed 20% and most were close to 10%.

as components of an exacerbation, and these were both reported in similar proportions Further to the lack of increased FEV1 falls in response to study drug, falls in FEV1 and dyspnoea were also recorded of  patients  experiencing  exacerbations  in  the  Bronchitol  and  control  arms.  If  there  was  increased bronchial reactivity in the Bronchitol arm at the time of an exacerbation it would be expected that they would therefore show a higher frequency of these events. The data is not indicative of this.

bronchoconstriction related AEs reported at the same time, which is similar to the rates of In  addition,  out  of  the  64  patients  experiencing  an  exacerbation  in  either  treatment  arm,  only  7 (10.9%) had these events seen outside the period of exacerbations.

Thus, while reasonable hypothetical concerns were raised regarding increased airway-reactivity at the time of exacerbations, there is no evidence of a higher frequency or greater severity of bronchoconstriction events during exacerbations.

## Patients with potential susceptibility show no increased risk of bronchoconstriction

patients with a degree of bronchoconstriction (FEV1 fall ≥ 10%) during 1 ction risk Patients who might potentially be most at risk of increased hyper-reactivity during the study were also specifically examined i.e. those the screening test dose of mannitol but who still went into the study. Patients with a less than 10% fall in FEV1 after the test dose had a similar incidence of bronchoconstriction related AEs to those with at least a 10% fall in FEV (6.3% vs 6.5% respectively) indicating no increase in bronchoconstri in this group.

1 Furthermore,  patients  who  had  post  mannitol  falls  in  FEV 1 of  10%  or  more  during  their  mannitol tolerability  test  at  screening,  had long-term FEV1  improvements that were similar to the rest of the study population. In this group the falls in FEV post-dose at all visits were similar, and showed no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

change in average fall in FEV1, despite hypothetically being more vulnerable to lung function drops on treatment.

In conclusion an evaluation of more than six hundred patients in both pivotal trials for risks associated with bronchospasm, found that the MTT appeared to be a safe and effective screening procedure, since bronchoconstriction events during the treatment period were not notable. Although bronchoconstriction remains  a  potential  risk,  if  the  recommended  strategy  of  a  screening  test  to  assess  tolerability  in addition to the prophylactic use of a pre-treatment bronchodilator is used, then the apparent risk of bronchospasm with therapeutic Bronchitol is low. The applicant suggested a reference to the initiation dose assessment in section 4.2 of the SPC which is expected to provide an effective safety measure in the post authorisation setting.

Since bronchospasm during and after the initiation dose assessment and also during long term use were identified as potential risks, a precaution was proposed in section 4.4 of the SPC.

bronchial hyperresponsiveness to inhaled tolerability test prior to continuing with treatment. If this test is positive In addition to the SPC precaution outlined above, it is proposed to include in the product information, as  part  of  a  stopping  rule,  that  physicians  will  enquire  whether  patients  experience  an  increase  in bronchoconstriction symptoms at the end of the initial treatment period. If symptoms are present then it  will  be  recommended that the patient is re-assessed for mannitol by taking a further treatment would be stopped. This would further minimise the risk of bronchospasm.

ial risks. Furthermore,  routine  and  additional  pharmacovigilance  and  risk  minimisation  activities  have  been outlined  in  the  RMP  (Module  1.8.2)  addressing  the  risk  of  bronchospasm  during  and  after  the assessment as well as during long-term use. These include as additional risk minimisation activities a healthcare professional leaflet addressing definition, identification/monitoring and information related to these potent reviews, will minimise any potential risks. In  summary,  bronchospasm  is  an  event  uncommonly  reported  across  both  phase  3  studies  and bronchoconstriction related events are reported at similar levels between treatment groups in all age and rhDNase subgroups assessed. Furthermore an assessment of bronchoconstriction risk with long term treatment and in at-risk situations such as during exacerbations, confirmed that there is not an increased  risk  of  bronchoconstriction.  However,  bronchospasm  during  and  after  the  initiation  dose assessment  and  during  long  term  use  are  identified  as  potential  risks  in  the  Bronchitol  RMP.  The proposed labelling includes the assessment for bronchial hyperresponsiveness to inhaled mannitol and prophylactic  bronchodilator  use.  These,  together  with  RMP  activities  including  close  monitoring  and cumulative

## Haemoptysis risk is not high

Haemoptysis  is  common  for  patients  with  CF,  although  typically  the  bleeding  is  scant  or  mild.  CF patients have chronically inflamed and friable airways and in this pathological situation haemoptysis is to be expected, and is not an unusual occurrence. Haemoptysis can be of varying cause for concern depending on the extent of bleeding occurring; sputum streaking has very different implications to a large haemorrhage. Massive haemoptysis occurs more commonly in older patients with more advanced lung disease.

Overall  the  incidence  of  haemoptysis  was  similar  between  the  two  treatment  groups  (15.8%  versus tom  of  the  exacerbation,  and  not  therefore  reported  as  a  separate  AE.  When  all  events  were 14.6% for the Bronchitol and control groups, respectively) in the pooled Phase 3 studies. Haemoptysis was  reported  as  an  AE  that  was  outside  an  exacerbation  more  frequently  in  the  Bronchitol  group (6.1%)  than  in  the  control  group  (3.8%).  However,  haemoptysis  is  frequently  associated  with  CF exacerbations. Indeed, two-thirds (61/92) of the total incidence of haemoptysis was associated with pulmonary exacerbation. Haemoptysis occurring during an exacerbation was commonly captured as a symp

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

appropriately  included,  the  total  incidence  of  haemoptysis  was  similar  between  treatment  groups (Table 9).

Most  of  the  haemoptysis  events  noted  with  Bronchitol  were  mild  or  moderate,  with  only  1.1%  and 0.4%  of  patients  reporting  severe  events  of  haemoptysis  in  the  Bronchitol  and  Control  arms respectively.  Treatment  emergent  massive  haemoptysis  occurred  infrequently,  in  study  DPM-CF-301 there  was  one  case  in  each  arm  and  in  study  DPM-CF-302  one  case  in  the  Bronchitol  arm.  This  is consistent with the expected rate of massive haemoptysis of 0.9%/year based on reviews published in CF.

## Haemoptysis incidence consistent with background rate

s well as the incidence being similar in the Bronchitol and control arms, the incidence of haemopt sis r disease severity, the incidence of haemoptysis was 21% and 31% over 6 months with rhDNase and TOBI placebo groups respectively, and was already not a significant A y does not exceed expected background rates based upon incidence observed in the placebo arms of published therapeutic studies. In patients of simila 8%  in  the  Aztreonam  placebo  group  after  1  month  (shaded  columns  in  Table  10).  Thus  the  data suggest that the incidence of haemoptysis in the Bronchitol development program is risk associated with Bronchitol treatment, but rather a risk consistent with the disease state.

Although  the  risk  of  haemoptysis  does  not  appear  elevated,  it  is  an  identified  risk.  Therefore  a precaution is proposed in section 4.4 of the SPC.

Furthermore,  routine  and  additional  pharmacovigilance  and  risk  minimisation  activities  have  been outlined in the RMP (Module 1.8.2) addressing the identified risk of haemoptysis.

In summary, although the level of haemoptysis noted in pivotal studies is in line with that expected in CF, this is an identified risk in the Bronchitol RMP. Therefore the proposed labelling and RMP activities including close monitoring and cumulative reviews are in place to minimise this risk.

## Optimisation of benefit/risk - justification for a stopping rule

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  applicant  believes  that  adequate  benefit/risk  has  already  been  demonstrated  in  the  overall population of the pivotal studies.  However,  there  are  approaches  which  might  allow  further nhancement that is either reliably identifying patients who are more likely to respond, or limiting long ate a response. e term therapy to those who demonstr can potentially experience meaningful benefit are not excluded. Firstly, pre-treatment criteria (predicting whether or not a patient will respond long-term to treatment based upon baseline characteristics) were explored. For any criteria to be useful it should reduce the exposure to drug for patients that will not experience any benefit, but also ensure that patients who

The second approach, to minimise any potential risks and increase benefit, involves a stopping rule after a trial of therapy to ensure that patients achieve a minimum level of response before continuing further  treatment  with  Bronchitol.  A  formal  review  of  response  is  also  an  opportunity  to  question patients specifically for signs or symptoms of bronchoconstriction, and investigate further if required.

weeks of treatment was highly predictive of response over the whole 6 months of the double  blind  studies,  and  a  stopping  rule  at  6  weeks  for  patients  showing  early  signs  of  response Following  an  evaluation  of  over  16  variables  including  age,  disease  severity,  and  lung  infection comorbidity,  no  pre-treatment  criteria  were  found  in  which  both  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  were high enough to be clinically useful. The alternative approach of a trial of therapy with a stopping rule was  therefore  explored,  and  this  is  described  in  the  following  section.  It  was  found  that  an  FEV 1 response after 6 therefore offers an attractive option.

## Trial of Therapy with Stopping Rule

A trial of therapy with a stopping rule is particularly applicable if an early response can be shown to reasonably predict a long term response. This in turn minimises exposure in non-responding patients, and hence only patients who are likely to continue to respond ('responders') continue with treatment.

To increase objectivity, the assessment was based on an improvement from baseline in FEV1, after a fixed  period  of  time.  For  Bronchitol,  a  treatment  period  of  6  weeks  was  explored  to  assess  its sensitivity and specificity to predict a sustained response, as this was the earliest time point assessed in the pivotal studies, but is also reasonably in keeping with the timing in clinical practice for a first follow-up assessment of a new therapy, and does not expose non-responders to unreasonable risk.

1 n CF, and CHMP guidelines do . Currently there is no globally accepted threshold for FEV improvement i not  define  a  threshold.  European  CF  experts  consulted  considered  that  because  lung  function  is continually declining in CF, any statistically significant benefit in lung function is meaningful. Therefore a  range  of  response  thresholds  were  explored  from  &gt;  0  to ≥ 12%  relative  improvements  in  % predicted FEV1

xperts view any sustained benefit as meaningful, thresholds above 6% are unnecessarily Calculations  have  been  performed  regarding  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  each  threshold  for  a responder from the pooled clinical studies, thereby providing a measure of how predictive the week 6 response was for a sustained response out to week 26. This data suggests that most of the thresholds explored  are  reasonable;  for  example,  a  response  of ≥ 6%  provides  a  good  balance  of  sensitivity (86.5%) and specificity (83.0%), and would lead to 41.3% of patients continuing Bronchitol beyond 6 weeks. As e high to ensure meaningfulness, and also start to lose sensitivity, without much gain in specificity.

Continuing  with  the  same  example,  (i.e.  a  6%  threshold),  when  the  mean  relative  change  from baseline in % predicted in the Bronchitol arm of the overall pooled ITT population was compared with that using the 6% threshold, the mean relative change from baseline in % predicted over the 26 week study  period  increased  from  4.8%  to  16.3%.  This  provides  an  indication  of  the  enhanced  level  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

effectiveness in FEV1 which can be expected over 26 weeks in a responder population, if the example of a stopping rule using a 6% threshold at 6 weeks was introduced.

The  applicant  proposes  to  implement  the  stopping  rule  by  amending  the  product  information.  It  is proposed that patients undergo a trial of therapy for 6 weeks, at the end of which the change from aseline  in  FEV 1 will  be  assessed.  Only  if  the  threshold  (to  be  determined)  is  met,  will  patients b continue with therapy.

of  the e It  is  also  proposed  to  include  an  additional  safety  step  in  the  product  information  as  part stopping  rule  to  further  minimise  bronchospasm  risk.  Physicians  will  ask  patients  at  the  end  of  th initial 6 week treatment period whether they have experienced new or increased signs or symptoms of bronchoconstriction. If present, it will be recommended that the patient be re-assessed for bronchial hyperresponsiveness  to  inhaled  mannitol  by  taking  a  further  tolerability  test  prior  to  continuing Bronchitol.

1 activity if bronchoconstriction signs or symptoms arise In conclusion, using a stopping rule which includes a response threshold (to be determined) after 6 weeks  of  treatment  increases  positive  benefit/risk  by  stopping  treatment  in  non-responders  and ensuring  patients  being  treated  meet  a  level  of  FEV improvement considered clinically  meaningful. The inclusion of a re-test for bronchial hyper-re will further reduce the risk of bronchospasm. This type of approach also addresses concerns regarding inconsistency of effect as patients are assessed for effectiveness and only proceed if the threshold is met,  irrespective  of  age  or  concomitant  rhDNase  use.  Therefore,  the  response  threshold  with  a stopping rule provides an approach that improves the certainty of response, minimises risk and is in line with the individualised treatment strategy which is used for CF patients.

## CHMP position on ground 3

The two main safety issues identified by the CHMP were bronchoconstriction and haemoptysis.

ible  patients, all dy DPM-CFl (mean maximum fall in FEV1 26.4%, Since inhaled dry powder mannitol is known to cause bronchoconstriction in suscept patients underwent a mannitol tolerance test (MTT) prior to randomised treatment. In stu 301, 378 subjects were enrolled and underwent the MTT. Of these 324 were randomised to treatment. Of those that failed to progress to randomisation, 27 had a &gt;20% fall in FEV1 following the MTT (7.5% of those tested), despite premedication with 400mcg salbutamo range 18 - 39). In addition there were 19 subjects who failed to complete the mannitol tolerance test, with cough (9/19), bronchoconstriction symptoms (5/19) and nausea (4/19) being the most common symptoms associated with incomplete testing.

1 any other time during or immediately Of the 342 patients who underwent MTT in study DPM-CF-302, 18 (5.3%) had a positive MTT and 8 patients had an incomplete test due to mannitol induced cough or other unspecified reasons. The mean maximum fall in FEV1 was 26.3%. The most frequently reported adverse events reported in association with  the  MTT  were  cough  (12.6%)  and  wheeze  (0.9%).  Bronchoconstriction  was  an  expected  effect during the MTT and was not considered as an adverse event unless the bronchoconstriction caused a &gt;50% fall in FEV  or the subject desaturated to &lt;89%. If at following the administration of the mannitol/control powder, the subject experienced a fall in FEV1 of &gt;20% due to bronchoconstriction, the subject was monitored for 30 minutes before having the FEV1 measurement  repeated.  Subjects  who  had  not  recovered  their  FEV1  to  &lt;  20%,  at  this  point  and provisos 1 and 2 (below) had been met, did not receive further study medication.

1) A suitable bronchodilator was taken prior to administration of the mannitol/control;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2)  The  investigator  determined  that  the  fall  in  FEV 1 was  bronchoconstriction  and  not  due  to  mucus plug or floppy airway collapse. This was to be tested by administering positive pressure via a PEP mask or Acapella device or similar and repeating the FEV1 manoeuvres.

The applicant concludes that the MTT appeared to be a safe and effective screening procedure since subsequent airway reactivity during the treatment period was not a notable event, i.e. there were 2 cases  of  bronchospasm  in  the  phase  III  trials,  both  in  the  Bronchitol  group,  that  lead  to  treatment discontinuation. However, bronchoconstriction related events (wheeze, chest discomfort and dyspnoea) had a similar incidence in both treatment groups (6.1% in patients on Bronchitol and 5.0% on control).

The applicant has provided a table comparing the frequency of bronchospasm and bronchoconstriction related  events  of  Bronchitol  with  that  of  other  inhaled  agents  for  CF  (rhDNase,  TOBI,  aztreonam, tobramycin inhalation powder).

Furthermore, the applicant argued that bronchospasm events are consistent with rates to be expected in a CF population and arise from the underlying disease rather than its treatment. According to the expert group bronchospasm is probably inherent to the treatment with inhaled mannitol and not to the disease; nevertheless, the panel concluded that this safety issue is manageable in clinical practice.

and a pre-treatment n 4.4 of the proposed SPC is endorsed. Overall,  the  CHMP  is  of  the  view  that  the  data  provided  suggest  that  bronchoconstriction  can reasonably be prevented with the use of the mannitol tolerance test bronchodilator. Whether patients with pulmonary exacerbations are at increased risk of this adverse event cannot be completely ruled out but the overall frequency of reporting does not suggest it. In addition to the instructions given in section 4.2 in relation to the performance of the mannitol tolerance test, the use of a bronchodilator pre-treatment etc. prior the initiation of treatment with Bronchitol, the applicant  proposed  that  all  patients  should  be  formally  reviewed  after  approximately  six  weeks  of Bronchitol treatment to assess for signs and symptoms suggestive of drug induced bronchospasm. This precautionary measure in sectio

Bronchospasm is considered as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. Routine pharmacovigilance  for  monitoring  this  adverse  event  as  well  as  several  risk  minimisation  activities (statements  in  the  SPC,  educational  pack  -  healthcare  professional  leaflet)  are  proposed.  These measures cover the occurrence of such events during and after the initiation dose assessment, as well as  during  long-term  (chronic)  use  of  inhaled  mannitol.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  considers  that  this identified risk is adequately addressed.

chitol and on control With regard to haemoptysis, the overall incidence was similar in patients on Bron (15.8%  and  14.6%  respectively)  in  the  pooled  main  studies.  However,  when  haemoptysis  was reported as a stand alone AE (outside of pulmonary exacerbations) the incidence was higher in the Bronchitol group (6.1% versus 3.8%) suggesting that haemoptysis may be related to treatment rather than the disease. Similar percentages, however, are shown for haemoptysis related to exacerbations (9.7% for patients on Bronchitol and 10.9% in patients in the control group).

ients with cystic fibrosis is provided. Comparisons across trials may provide some insight To explore how haemoptysis in the Bronchitol and control group compares with that reported in other trials a table quoting the percentage of haemoptysis for different inhaled medicinal products commonly used by pat but  the  data  should  be  considered  with  caution  due  to  limitations  related  to  the  trial  population, disease severity and whether patients with previous antecedents of haemoptysis were permitted to be enrolled in these trials or not.

Co-administered  inhaled  products  which  have  been  associated  with  reports  of  haemoptysis  include dornase alpha and hypertonic saline. Hypertonic saline was not permitted in studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302.  The  Clinical  Study  Reports  provide  the  following  information:  in  study  DPM-CF-301 haemoptysis was reported by 13 (13.5%) and 7 (10.4%) rhDNase users and 8 (9.9%) and 3 (5.9%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

non-users in the mannitol and control groups respectively. In study DPM-CF-302, 12 of the 13 subjects who  had  haemoptysis  recorded  as  an  adverse  event  in  the  mannitol  group  in  the  overall  safety population  were  rhDNase  users.  Therefore,  the  co-administration  of  dornase  alpha  increases  the incidence of haemoptysis (and also that of other adverse events such as cough).

The expert group was of the opinion that haemoptysis as seen in the main studies is manageable in agement  Plan.  Routine  pharmacovigilance  for s  identified  risk  is  adequately clinical practice. Hence it is considered that haemoptysis needs to be monitored in patients receiving inhaled mannitol hence a precautionary statement is included in section 4.4 of the SPC. Haemoptysis is considered  as  an  identified  risk  in  the  Risk  Man monitoring this adverse event as well as several risk minimisation activities (statements in the SPC, educational  pack  -  healthcare  professional  leaflet)  are  proposed.  The  above-mentioned  view  of  the experts  was  endorsed  by  the  CHMP  and  therefore  considered  that  thi addressed.

ctor  of  long-term  response.  Based  on  an  evaluation  of  data  from tudies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302 and the analysis of a variety of variables to serve as predictor, a stopping rule after a trial of therapy was proposed based on the change in  FEV1 after 6 weeks as this was identified  as  highly  predictive  of  response  over  the  whole  6  months  of  double-blind  treatment. However,  further  to  considering  the  above-mentioned  proposal  from  the  applicant,  the  CHMP concluded that this stopping rule, which is based on post-hoc review of the data, cannot be considered as  a  valid  instrument  for  the  intended  purpose.  In  fact,  the  proposed  stopping  rule  was  considered more to reflect clinical practise rather than a product specific approach. The proposal was therefore not accepted. Nevertheless, the two main safety issues - namely bronchoconstriction and haemoptysis can  be  addressed  adequately  through  the  risk  minimisation  activities  discussed  above,  and  without such stopping rule. To further optimise the benefit risk balance of the product, the applicant proposed the introduction of a stopping  rule  using  an  early  predi s

The CHMP agreed that the collection of post-marketing safety data through the UK CF registry is an important additional pharmacovigilance activity. During the procedure, the applicant provided a study synopsis, which is part of the Risk Management Plan.

The applicant is requested to submit periodic analysis of the CF study every 6 months for 3 years and annually for 2 years. The final report is expected in Q1 2018.

In conclusion, further to the assessment of the applicant's responses to the grounds for refusal and to the advice provided by the ad-hoc expert group, the CHMP concluded that the ground for refusal No. 3 had been adequately addressed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.2.2. Ad Hoc Expert Group meeting

Following a request from the applicant at the time of the re-examination, the CHMP convened an adhoc  expert  meeting  on  3  October  2011  inviting  the  experts,  including  patients  representatives,  to provide  their  views  on  the  questions  posed  by  the  CHMP  in  relation  to  the  marketing  authorisation application,  taking  into  account  the  applicant's  response  to  the  grounds  for  refusal.  The  abovementioned questions, together with the experts' conclusions, are shown below:

## Experts' input on the CHMP questions:

Mechanism of action

1. The applicant considers that the mechanism of action is through the osmotic properties of mannitol increasing  airways  epithelial  lining  fluid,  and  thus  reducing  sputum  viscosity.  However,  an alternative mechanism which could contribute to sputum clearance is through increase in cough. Could the group comment?

Experts' response: It is the unanimous view of the experts that the predominant mechanism of action is the change in osmolarity hence the hypothesis of hyperosmolarity due to administration of inhaled mannitol  leading  to  reduced  sputum  viscosity  is  accepted.  With  regard  to  cough  there  is  a  need  to differentiate  between  productive  and  reactive  events.  Productive  cough  can  be  supportive  as  it  can contribute to sputum clearance. Reactive cough is solely a side effect.

## Efficacy

2. There  is  considerable  heterogeneity  between  and  within  studies  with  respect  to  benefit  on  lung function. Study DPM-CF-301 showed a statistically significant benefit for FEV1 (mL). Study DPMCF-302 did not, at least in terms of the primary analysis. Furthermore, there were differences in outcome  for  children,  adolescents,  and  adults.  From  a  clinical  point  of  view,  are  the  observed differences surprising or expected  (e.g. as a result of small study  numbers  and  varied demographics)? If the heterogeneity is surprising, could the group say why?

Experts' response: There is heterogeneity between the subgroups in studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF302 and depending on the type of analysis performed (absolute change in FEV1, relative % predicted, absolute % predicted). However, the experts noted that the two studies were not powered for such subgroup  analysis  hence  this  heterogeneity  is  not  considered  of  relevance.  At  the  same  time,  the experts indicated that the studies should ideally have been stratified for such subgroup analysis since it is clinically plausible to detect differences.

Furthermore for the present application, the group did not consider the inconsistency of the results seen in the different age groups as an issue since the claimed indication is restricted to adults only. In contrast,  the  experts  raised  concerns  about  the  fact  that  the  indication  proposed  by  the  applicant includes rhDNAse users and non-users even if the studies were not powered for the analysis of these two subgroups (see below).

3. In both pivotal Phase 3 studies the effect size for FEV 1 is small and of debatable clinical relevance. The applicant argues that any improvement in lung function in the population studied is clinically relevant. Please provide your opinion on the clinical relevance of the observed treatment effect for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

each population (children, adolescents and adults) as well as the overall population. The experts are also invited to discuss whether the rate of the decline in lung function in CF patients changed over  the  past  years  and  what  should  be  the  benchmark  for  a  product  impacting  on  sputum clearance (and not an antibiotic) like inhaled mannitol.

Experts' response: The effect size is considered small and based on the available data it is difficult to ascertain whether the treatment effect is clinically relevant. However, the experts also noted that even a small benefit can be of relevance in an individual patient given the deterioration of FEV 1 inherent to the  disease  progression.  The  results  in  adolescents  were  considered  surprising  from  a  clinical perspective as this is the patient population where normally benefits are clearly demonstrated, which seems not to be the case across both pivotal studies.

Regarding  benchmarking  the  experts  agreed  that  the  mechanisms  of  action  need  to  be  considered. Therefore, for inhaled mannitol a different approach should be taken compared to antibiotics. Acting on sputum clearance constitutes an additional approach but this cannot be compared versus antibiotics. In general the experts indicated that FEV1 remains an important outcome parameter for studies in cystic fibrosis; from a patients' perspective a relief in symptoms is very important.

4. The change in FEV1 can be measured as the absolute change from baseline (in litres), the relative change (as percent change from baseline), or the absolute change in percent predicted FEV1. While the predefined primary endpoint in the two phase 3 pivotal studies is the change from baseline in FEV1 (mL) in the response to the CHMP grounds for refusal the results are discussed as the relative change in FEV1 predicted of normal. While using FEV1 (% predicted) is endorsed if children and adolescents are considered it is believed that the results to be taken into consideration are those corresponding to the absolute change in percent predicted FEV1. Could the experts provide their opinion on the above issue?

Experts'  response:  The  assessment  based  on  relative  %  predicted  change  is  better  than  the  use  of absolute change in mL, the latter being not considered appropriate for the study. However, the experts also noted that the absolute % predicted change would have been even better.

5. The  applicant  claims  an  indication  for  the  use  either  as  an  add-on  therapy  to  rhDNase  or  in patients intolerant to, or inadequately responsive to, rhDNase. The experts are invited to discuss whether from the clinical perspective the data in all or part of these subgroups related to rhDNase use are compelling. Additionally, while analysis by non-use/use of rhDNase was predefined in the statistical  analysis  plans  of  studies  DMP-CF-301  and  302  there  was  an  assumption  that  all  non rhDNase users would reflect, and therefore be representative of the subpopulation of non rhDNase users who were 'intolerant to, or inadequately responsive to rhDNase'. Could the experts provide their  opinion  on  what  would  constitute  an  adequate  definition  of  patients  intolerant  to,  or inadequately responsive to rhDNase?

Experts' response: The criteria for the subgroups related to rhDNAse users and non-users were not pre-specified for both studies, which renders the interpretation of the results very difficult. Moreover, studies DMP-CF-301 and DMP-CF-302 were not powered to make such stratifications. From a clinical perspective, the proposed distinction between rhDNAse users and non-users appear difficult given that in  practice  the  (non-)use  of  rhDNAse  is  also  subject  to  patient's  choice,  hence  the  definition  of rhDNAse non-users appears not appropriate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As mentioned above, a general issue is the fact that the studies were powered only for the overall population but the indication claims an effect on both rhDNAse users and non-users. It may be more appropriate not to specifically indicate in the indication the rhDNAse use.

## Safety

6. Bronchospasm  and  haemoptysis  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  Bronchitol  than  the  control treatment arms of the studies. The applicant argues that these events are consistent with rates to be expected in a CF population and arise from the underlying disease rather than its treatment. Could the group provide their view?

Experts' response: It is likely that bronchospasm is inherent to the treatment with inhaled mannitol and not to the disease. Regardless of this, the safety issues observed are not a major problem from the clinicians' point of view. It was noted however that patients might be concerned by an event of haemoptysis hence education is necessary.

## 4.2.3. Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination

The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the applicant in writing and in the oral explanation and considered the views of the ad-hoc expert group.

The applicant has conducted two six month, placebo controlled, phase III clinical trials of dry-powder inhaled mannitol in the treatment of cystic fibrosis involving a total of 600 patients. Studies DPM-CF301  and  DPM-CF-302  included  children,  adolescents,  and  adults  and  used  absolute  change  from baseline in lung function (FEV 1 ) as the primary efficacy variable. The studies show an effect of inhaled mannitol on lung function.

The  uncertainties  regarding  the  methodology,  conduct  and  interpretation  of  the  two  pivotal  trials identified by the CHMP in the initial assessment were considered unacceptable in light of the conclusion that  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  treatment  effect  was  questionable.  During  the  re-examination procedure, the view of CHMP on the clinical relevance of the results was changed following consultation of  an  ad-hoc expert group and the statistical analyses presented by the applicant were accepted as comprehensively addressing concerns over the uncertainty introduced because of missing data due to patient  withdrawal.  Regarding  the  issue  of  apparent  heterogeneity  in  the  trial  results,  the  applicant used a proper set of available statistical methodologies to explore these effects, 'interaction tests' and subgroup analyses, complemented by discussion on the biological plausibility of observing heterogenous  results.  These  arguments  were  accepted  by  the  CHMP  to  conclude  that  the  effect demonstrated  in  adults,  across  multiple  trials,  was  robust.  Taking  into  account  the  arguments presented during the re-examination, the CHMP concluded that the studies were fit for purpose and any  residual,  minor  methodological  concerns  were  of  no  consequence  to  demonstration  of  efficacy, assessment of safety or judgement on benefit-risk.

The  predominant  mechanism  of  action  of  inhaled  mannitol  is  understood  to  be  the  change  in osmolarity,  particularly  the  hyperosmolarity  due  to  administration  of  inhaled  mannitol  leading  to reduced sputum viscosity. Productive cough can be supportive as it can contribute to sputum clearance and reactive cough is solely a side effect. These assumptions were confirmed by the expert group.

In both main studies the effect size for FEV1 is small. Overall, the treatment with mannitol showed an improvement  of  approximately  2-3%  compared  with  the  control  group  over  26  weeks  in  terms  of percent  predicted  FEV1.  The  clinical  relevance  of  such  a  marginal  effect  is  difficult  to  acertain. Therefore, this critical question was posed to an ad-hoc expert group. Acknowledging that the effect

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

size is small, the experts nevertheless agreed unanimously that any improvement in lung function in the  population  studied  can  be  of  relevance  in  an  individual  patient  given  the  deterioration  of  FEV 1 inherent to the disease progression. The above was subsequently endorsed by the CHMP.

The CHMP had raised concerns regarding the observed heterogeneity between and within studies with respect to benefit on lung function. While study DPM-CF-301 showed a statistically significant benefit for FEV1 (mL), study DPM-CF-302 did not, at least in terms of the primary analysis. Furthermore, there were differences in outcome for children, adolescents, and adults. From the view of the expert group the  fact  that  the  study  was  not  stratified  for  the  various  sub-groups  is  a  limitation  since  certain variability is clinically plausible. The inconsistency across age groups was considered less of a concern. This is because the effect size in the adult population was similar in the two pivotal studies and was consistent with the 2 supportive studies, all showing a similar benefit in FEV1 and it was considered that the available data could support an indication in adults (for both Phase III studies there was a statistically significant benefit in the primary efficacy variable, change in FEV1 from baseline to study end, for Bronchitol compared to control treatment arms). This suggests that the benefit is real, and is unlikely to be an artefact of the subgroup analyses presented by age. In addition it is considered that the  effect  has  been  measured  with  acceptable  precision,  and  it  is  recognised  by  the  ad-hoc  expert group  cystic  fibrosis  experts  and  the  CHMP  to  be  small,  but  of  clinical  relevance.  Moreover,  the differential response according to patients' age may be due to clinical trials conducted in a refractory disease, in a relatively small number of patients. Taking the above information into account, the CHMP concluded that the studies are considered reliable.

The  previously  claimed  indication  made  a  difference  between  rhDNAse  users  and  non-users.  This proposal has limitations from a methodological view point in terms of definition and stratification, as well as from the results. In clinical practice the definition of rhDNAse users appears not appropriate, as stated  by  the  experts.  The  applicant  changed  the  proposed  indication  to  add-on  therapy  to  best standard  of  care,  which  the  CHMP  considered  acceptable;  there  was  evidence  of  efficacy,  which  is regarded as being of clinical relevance, also in this subgroup although the effect size appeared smaller in the RhDNase subgroup.

Both  Phase  III  studies  demonstrated  a  clinically  relevant  benefit  in  the  primary  efficacy  variable, change in FEV1 from baseline to study end, for Bronchitol compared to the control treatment arms, for both rhDNase users and non-users. These data supersede the rather equivocal and difficult to interpret data from phase II studies given that the phase III studies are larger and better reflect clinical practice since  both  rhDNAse  users  and  non-users  were  included.  The  CHMP  conclusion  is  that  the  effect  in rhDNAse users and non-users is established, that clinical benefit in both rhDNAse users and non-users is positive and that benefits in both groups are considered clinically relevant.

Children and adolescents were included in the patient population in the two main studies. However, based on the available data the efficacy in this paediatric population has not been demonstrated. From a clinical  perspective - given the demographics of CF patients - such reliable data in the paediatric population appears paramount; these data will further establish the benefit risk of the product. The applicant is therefore requested by the CHMP as a condition to the marketing authorisation to conduct a  study  to  investigate  efficacy  and  safety  data  of  Bronchitol  in  children  and  adolescents  with  cystic fibrosis.

With  regard  to  the  safety  of  Bronchitol,  two  main  safety  issues  have  been  identified  by  the  CHMP: bronchoconstriction and haemoptysis.

Regarding the risk of bronchoconstriction, the CHMP is of the view that the data provided suggest that can  reasonably  be  prevented  with  the  use  of  the  mannitol  tolerance  test  and  a  pre-treatment bronchodilator.  Furthermore,  the  product  information  includes  an  additional  measure,  i.e.  that physicians should formally review patients after approximately six weeks of Bronchitol treatment. If

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

symptoms of Bronchitol induced bronchospasm are presented patients should undergo the mannitol tolerance test again; if this test is positive treatment would be stopped. This would further minimise the  risk  of  bronchospasm.  According  to  the  expert  group  bronchospasm  is  probably  inherent  to  the treatment with inhaled mannitol and not to the disease; nevertheless, the panel concluded that this safety issue is manageable in clinical practice. Overall, bronchospasm is considered as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. Routine pharmacovigilance for monitoring this adverse event as well as several risk minimisation activities (statements in the SPC, educational pack - healthcare professional leaflet)  are  proposed.  These  measures  cover  the  occurrence  of  such  events  during  and  after  the initiation dose assessment, as well as during long-term (chronic) use of inhaled mannitol. Therefore, the CHMP considers that this identified risk is adequately addressed.

The expert group concurred that haemoptysis as seen in the main studies is manageable in clinical practice. Hence it is considered that haemoptysis needs to be monitored in patients receiving inhaled mannitol  hence  a  precautionary  statement  is  included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SPC.  Haemoptysis  is considered  as  an  identified  risk  in  the  Risk  Management  Plan.  Routine  pharmacovigilance  for monitoring this adverse event as well as several risk minimisation activities (statements in the SPC, educational pack - healthcare professional leaflet) are proposed. Therefore, the CHMP considers that this identified risk is adequately addressed.

For additional post-marketing safety data collection, the applicant has proposed a study using the UK CF registry. This proposal is endorsed by the CHMP.

At the time of the initial, negative CHMP opinion, there was a quality issue that was not fully addressed by  the  applicant.  The  issue  relates  to  the  preservative  efficacy  of  mannitol  and  its  potential  as  a microbiological  growth  substrate  in  an  in-use  context  for  cystic  fibrosis  pathogens  e.g.  Burkholdaria cepacia, Aspergillus fumigatus, etc. No data were provided in the MAA that explicitly address this issue. However, considering that the inhaler device is to be used for 7 days only and that clear instructions on how to clean the device are included in the package leaflet, this issue was not considered a major objection at the time of neither the first CHMP opinion nor the re-examination CHMP opinion, as it does not compromise change the positive benefit-risk conclusion. It is therefore not considered necessary to have the results from this study prior to authorisation.

Nevertheless, due to the potential risk of 'Microbial infection via a contaminated inhaler device' the preservative efficacy of mannitol should be monitored through additional studies and data collection through risk management. Therefore, the applicant should investigate whether potentially pathogenic species for CF patients could survive and whether they could replicate within the residual mannitol in the inhaler. The applicant should perform appropriate in-vitro microbiological studies reflecting 'in-use' conditions to assess the duration of survival and changes in numbers of organisms to help evaluate the potential  risk  that  important  species  such  as  Burkholderia  spp.  and  Aspergillus  spp.  could  be transmitted to patients from the inhaler.

In  conclusion,  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  small  treatment  effect  observed  on  FEV 1 is  considered established  given  the  deterioration  of  FEV 1 inherent  to  the  disease  progression  of  this  chronic condition. This is accepted for the use in adults in the dose of 400 mg bid on top of best standard of care. The safety issues are considered adequately addressed with the proposed pharmacovigilance and risk  minimisation  activities,  respectively,  and  are  manageable  in  clinical  practice.  The  benefit/risk conclusion for inhaled mannitol is therefore deemed positive.

## 4.2.4. Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a revised risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan.

The educational pack should contain the following:

-  Summary of Product Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Educational material for Healthcare Professionals

The educational material for Healthcare Professionals should be a leaflet that includes information on the following key elements:

-  The risk of bronchospasm during treatment
- o The need to perform the Bronchitol initiation dose assessment to identify patients who have bronchial hyperresponsiveness in response to inhaled mannitol by measuring the degree  of  bronchoconstriction  that  occurs  following  sequential  administrations  of mannitol.
- o How  to  perform  the  Bronchitol  initiation  dose  assessment  safely  and  how  long  to monitor the patient for.
- o How to interpret the results of the Bronchitol initiation dose assessment as Pass, Fail or Incomplete.
- o That therapeutic doses of Bronchitol should only be prescribed if the patient has passed the initiation dose assessment.
- o The  need  of  pre-medication  by  a  bronchodilator  5-15  minutes  before  the  Bronchitol initiation dose assessment and before each therapeutic administration of Bronchitol.
- o The need to check that the patient knows how to correctly use the bronchodilator.
- o The need to review the patient after approximately six weeks to assess for signs and symptoms of bronchospasm.
- o The risk of bronchospasm during long term treatment even if the Bronchitol initiation dose assessment was initially passed and the need to reiterate it in case of doubt.
-  The risk of haemoptysis during treatment
- o That Bronchitol has  not been  studied  in patients with a history of significant haemoptysis (&gt;60 ml) in the previous three months.
- o The need for monitoring and when to withhold treatment.
-  The potential risk of cough related sequelae during treatment
- o The  need  to  train  the  patient  to  minimise  cough  during  administration  in  using  the correct inhalation technique.

| The applicant should further investigate the efficacy and safety of Bronchitol in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis. The study protocol shall be agreed with the CHMP prior to the start of the study and the final results provided to the CHMP and EMA by June 2015. | June 2015  |
| The applicant is requested to submit periodic analysis of the CF study every 6 months for 3 years and annually for 2 years. The final report is expected in Q1 2018.                                                                                                               | Q1 2018    |

## Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States.

The  Member  States  should  ensure  that  all  conditions  or  restrictions  with  regard  to  the  safe  and effective use of the medicinal product described below are implemented:

-  Prior to launch of the product in the Member State, the national competent authority shall agree the  content  and  format  of  the  educational  material  with  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder. The  Marketing  Authorisation Holder (MAH)  should  ensure  that  at  launch  all  Healthcare Professionals  who  are  expected  to  use  and/or  prescribe  Bronchitol  are  provided  with  an educational pack.

The educational pack should contain the following:

-  Summary of Product Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet
-  Educational material for Healthcare Professionals

The educational material for Healthcare Professionals should be a leaflet that includes information on the following key elements:

-  The risk of bronchospasm during treatment
- o The need to perform the Bronchitol initiation dose assessment to identify patients who have bronchial hyperresponsiveness in response to inhaled mannitol by measuring the degree  of  bronchoconstriction  that  occurs  following  sequential  administrations  of mannitol.
- o How  to  perform  the  Bronchitol  initiation  dose  assessment  safely  and  how  long  to monitor the patient for.
- o How to interpret the results of the Bronchitol initiation dose assessment as Pass, Fail or Incomplete.
- o That therapeutic doses of Bronchitol should only be prescribed if the patient has passed the initiation dose assessment.
- o The  need  of  pre-medication  by  a  bronchodilator  5-15  minutes  before  the  Bronchitol initiation dose assessment and before each therapeutic administration of Bronchitol.
- o The need to check that the patient knows how to correctly use the bronchodilator.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o The need to review the patient after approximately six weeks to assess for signs and symptoms of bronchospasm.
- o The risk of bronchospasm during long term treatment even if the Bronchitol initiation dose assessment was initially passed and the need to reiterate it in case of doubt.
-  The risk of haemoptysis during treatment
- o That Bronchitol has  not been  studied  in patients with a history of significant haemoptysis (&gt;60 ml) in the previous three months.
- o The need for monitoring and when to withhold treatment.
-  The potential risk of cough related sequelae during treatment
- o The  need  to  train  the  patient  to  minimise  cough  during  administration  in  using  the correct inhalation technique.

## APPENDIX 1 DIVERGENT POSITIONS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Divergent Positions

The  undersigned  members  of  the  CHMP  did  not  agree  with  the  CHMP's  opinion  recommending  the granting of a Marketing Authorisation for Bronchitol.

The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows:

The pivotal studies (301 and 302) are considered not to provide adequate evidence of efficacy in the treatment  of  cystic  fibrosis  (CF)  in  adults  aged  18  years  and  above  as  an  add-on  therapy  to  best standard of care. In particular:

- the clinical relevance of the treatment effects observed on FEV 1 has not been established.
- uncertainties remain in the magnitude of the effect following treatment with Bronchitol. In Study 301 a  high  proportion  of  patient  withdrawals  complicates  inference.  The  pattern  of  estimated  treatment effects  is  inconsistent  within  each  study  across  important  subgroups  defined  by  age  (children, adolescents and adults) and the pattern of effects in each age group is inconsistent between studies. In light of the limited effects observed, these internal inconsistencies result in unacceptable uncertainty in the estimated treatment effect for the proposed population.

The limited efficacy, of uncertain magnitude, is considered not to outweigh the observed and potential safety  concerns,  relating  primarily  to  bronchoconstriction  events  and  haemoptysis,  such  that  a favourable benefit-risk cannot be concluded.
