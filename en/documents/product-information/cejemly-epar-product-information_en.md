## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Cejemly 600 mg concentrate for solution for infusion

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

One vial of 20 mL of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 600 mg of sugemalimab.

Each mL of concentrate contains 30 mg of sugemalimab.

Sugemalimab is a fully human anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody (IgG4 isotype) produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology.

## Excipient with known effect

One vial contains 25.8 mg of sodium. This medicine contains 2.04 mg of polysorbate 80 in each vial.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Concentrate for solution for infusion.

Clear to opalescent, colourless to slight yellow solution, essentially free from visible particles, pH 5.3 to 5.7.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Cejemly in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no sensitising EGFR mutations, or ALK, ROS1 or RET genomic tumour aberrations.

Cejemly as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of unresectable stage III NSCLC with no sensitising EGFR mutations, or ALK, ROS1 genomic tumour aberrations in adults whose tumours express PDL1 on ≥ 1% of tumour cells and whose disease has not progressed following platinumbased chemoradiotherapy.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Therapy should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products.

## PD-L1 testing for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC

To determine eligibility for treatment, tumour cell PD-L1 expression should be assessed with a CEmarked IVD with the corresponding intended purpose. If a CE-marked IVD is not available, an alternative validated test should be used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Posology

The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting sugemalimab should be avoided (see section 4.5).

## Recommended dose

The recommended dose of Cejemly monotherapy and Cejemly combination therapy is presented in Table 1. Cejemly is administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes.

When Cejemly is administered in combination with chemotherapy, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of the combination products (see also section 5.1).

## Immune-related adverse reactions

Immune-related adverse reactions, including serious and fatal cases, have occurred in patients receiving sugemalimab. Immune-related adverse reactions can occur after discontinuation of treatment. In clinical studies, most immune-related adverse reactions were reversible and managed with interruptions of sugemalimab treatment, administration of corticosteroids and/or supportive care. Immune-related adverse reactions affecting more than one body system can occur simultaneously.

For suspected immune-related adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm aetiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold, or permanently discontinue sugemalimab and consider administration of corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or 0, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper for at least 1 month. Restart sugemalimab if the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or 0 following corticosteroid tapering. If another episode of the severe adverse reaction occurs, permanently discontinue sugemalimab (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## Immune-related pneumonitis

Immune-related pneumonitis has been reported in patients receiving sugemalimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Suspected pneumonitis should be confirmed with radiographic imaging to exclude other causes. For Grade 2 pneumonitis, treatment with sugemalimab should be withheld, and 1 to 2 mg/kg /day prednisone or equivalent should be administered. If symptoms improve to Grade 0 or 1, corticosteroids should be tapered for at least 1 month. Treatment with sugemalimab may be resumed if the event remains at Grade 0 to 1 following corticosteroid tapering. Sugemalimab should be permanently discontinued for severe (Grade 3), life-threatening (Grade 4) or recurrent moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis (see section 4.2) and 1 to 2 mg/kg /day of methylprednisolone or equivalent should be administered.

## Pneumonitis and Radiation pneumonitis

Radiation pneumonitis is frequently observed in patients receiving radiation therapy to the lung and the clinical presentation of pneumonitis and radiation pneumonitis is very similar. In the Study GEMSTONE301, in patients who had completed treatment with at least 2 cycles concurrent or sequential chemoradiation within 1 to 42 days prior to initiation of study treatment, pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis have been reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis. Suspected radiation pneumonitis should be confirmed with radiographic imaging and other infectious and disease-related aetiologies excluded and managed as recommen ded in section 4.2.

## Immune-related skin reactions

Immune-related severe skin reactions have been reported in patients receiving sugemalimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for suspected severe skin reactions and other causes should be excluded. For Grade 3 skin reactions, sugemalimab should be withheld until recovery to Grade 0 to 1 and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent should be administered. Sugemalimab should be permanently discontinued for Grade 4 skin reactions, and corticosteroids should be administered.

Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. For suspected SJS or TEN, sugemalimab should be withheld and the patient should be referred to a specialised unit for assessment and treatment. For confirmed SJS or TEN, sugemalimab should be permanently discontinued (see section 4.2).

Caution should be used when considering the use of sugemalimab in a patient who has previously experienced a severe or life-threatening skin adverse reaction on prior treatment with other immunestimulatory anti-cancer agents.

## Immune-related colitis

Immune-related colitis has been reported in patients receiving sugemalimab monotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of colitis and other causes should be excluded. For Grade 2 colitis, treatment with sugemalimab should be withheld, and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent should be administered. For Grade 3 colitis, treatment with sugemalimab should be withheld, and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent should be administered. Treatment with sugemalimab may be resumed if the event remains at Grade 0 to 1 following corticosteroid tapering. Sugemalimab should be permanently discontinued for lifethreatening (Grade 4) or recurrent Grade 3 colitis (see section 4.2), and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent should be administered.

## Immune-related hepatitis

Immune-related hepatitis has occurred in patients receiving sugemalimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for abnormal liver tests prior to and as clinically indicated during treatment with sugemalimab. For Grade 2 hepatitis, treatment with sugemalimab should be withheld, and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent should be administered. Treatment with sugemalimab may be resumed if the event remains at Grade 0 or 1 following corticosteroid tapering. Sugemalimab should be permanently discontinued for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) hepatitis (see section 4.2), and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent should be administered.

## Immune-related nephritis

Immune-related nephritis has been reported in patients receiving sugemalimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for abnormal renal function tests prior to and periodically during treatment with sugemalimab and managed as recommended. For Grade 2 nephritis, treatment with sugemalimab should be withheld, and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent should be administered. For Grade 2 nephritis, treatment with sugemalimab may be resumed if the event remains at Grade 0 to 1 following corticosteroid tapering. Sugemalimab should be permanently discontinued for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) nephritis (see section 4.2) and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent should be administered.

## Immune-related endocrinopathies

Immune-related endocrinopathies including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, thyroiditis, diabetes mellitus, adrenal insufficiency and hypophysitis have been reported in patients receiving sugemalimab treatment (see section 4.8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Thyroid disorders have been reported in patients receiving sugemalimab, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and thyroiditis. These can occur at any time during treatment; therefore, patients should be monitored for changes in thyroid function and clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation).

For symptomatic hypothyroidism, sugemalimab should be withheld and thyroxine replacement therapy should be initiated as needed. For symptomatic hyperthyroidism sugemalimab should be withheld and an anti-thyroid medication should be initiated as needed. Treatment with sugemalimab may be resumed when symptoms are controlled, and thyroid function is improving. Sugemalimab should be permanently discontinued for life-threatening (Grade 4) hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (see section 4.2).

Type-1 diabetes mellitus has been reported in patients receiving sugemalimab. Patients should be monitored for hyperglycaemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes and managed with insulin as clinically indicated. For type-1 diabetes mellitus associated with Grade 3 hyperglycaemia sugemalimab should be withheld. Treatment with sugemalimab may be resumed if metabolic control is achieved on insulin replacement therapy. Sugemalimab should be permanently discontinued for type-1 diabetes mellitus associated with life-threatening (Grade 4) hyperglycaemia (see section 4.2).

Adrenal insufficiency has been reported in patients receiving sugemalimab. Hypophysitis has also been reported in patients receiving sugemalimab. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism) and other causes should be excluded. For Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or for Grade 2 or 3 hypophysitis, treatment with sugemalimab should be withheld (see section 4.2), and treatment with sugemalimab may be resumed if the event improves to Grade 0 to 1. Corticosteroids to treat adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis and other hormone replacement therapy (such as thyroxine in patients with hypophystitis) should be administered as clinically indicated. Pituitary function and hormone levels should be monitored to ensure appropriate hormone replacement. Sugemalimab should be permanently discontinued for Grade 3 or 4 adrenal insufficiency and for Grade 4 hypophysitis.

## Immune-related myositis

Immune-related myositis has been reported in patients receiving sugemalimab at very low frequency or with delayed onset of symptoms (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for potential myositis and other causes should be excluded. If a patient develops signs and symptoms of myositis, close monitoring should be implemented, and the patient referred to a specialist for assessment and treatment without delay. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold, or permanently discontinue sugemalimab (see section 4.2). For Grade 2 myositis, 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent should be administered. For Grade 3 or 4 myositis, methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or equivalents should be administered.

## Immune-related myocarditis

Immune-related myocarditis has been reported in patients receiving sugemalimab (see section 4.8). Monitor patients for suspected myocarditis and exclude other causes. If myocarditis is suspected, treatment with sugemalimab should be withheld, prompt initiation of systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent should be started, and prompt cardiology consultation with diagnostic workup according to current clinical guidelines should be initiated. Once a diagnosis of myocarditis is established, sugemalimab should be permanently discontinued for Grade 2, 3 or 4 myocarditis (see section 4.2).

## Immune-related pancreatitis

Immune-related pancreatitis has been reported in patients receiving sugemalimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be closely monitored for signs of symptoms suggestive of acute pancreatitis and for increases in serum amylase or lipase. For Grade 2 pancreatitis, treatment with sugemalimab should be withheld, and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent should be administered. For Grade 2 pancreatitis, treatment with sugemalimab may be resumed if the event remains at Grade 0 to 1 following corticosteroid tapering. Sugemalimab should be permanently discontinued for severe

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) pancreatitis (see section 4.2) and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent should be administered.

## Immune-related ocular toxicities

Immune-related ocular toxicities have been reported in patients receiving sugemalimab (see section 4.8). For Grade 2 ocular toxicities, treatment with sugemalimab should be withheld, and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent should be administered. For Grade 2 ocular toxicities, treatment with sugemalimab may be resumed if the event remains at Grade 0 to 1 following corticosteroid tapering. Sugemalimab should be permanently discontinued for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) ocular toxicities (see section 4.2) and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent should be administered.

## Other immune-related adverse reactions

Other immune-related adverse reactions including immune-related upper gastrointestinal disorders, immune-related arthritis, immune-related pancytopenia/bicytopenia, immune-related meningoencephalitis/encephalitis, immune-related Guillain-Barre syndrome/demyelination, immunerelated rhabdomyolysis/myopathy,immune-related hemolytic anemia, and immune-related vasculitis were reported in patients receiving sugemalimab (see section 4.8).

Patients should be monitored for suspected immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm aetiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold, or permanently discontinue sugemalimab (see section 4.2). For Grade 2 immune-mediated adverse reactions, 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent should be administered. For Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions, methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or equivalents should be administered.

## Infusion -related reactions

Infusion-related reactions including anaphylactic reaction, hyperhidrosis, pyrexia, chills, erythema and rash, have been reported in patients receiving sugemalimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be closely monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of an infusion reaction and managed as recommended in section 4.2.

## Patients excluded from clinical studies

Patients with the following conditions were excluded from clinical study: active autoimmune disease; receiving immunosuppressive treatment; live-virus vaccine administration within 28 days of the study treatment start; HIV infection, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection; a history of interstitial lung disease or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains 51.6 mg sodium per 1200 mg dose and 64.5 mg sodium per 1500 mg dose, equivalent to 2.58% and 3.23% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 grams for an adult. However, sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion is used for the dilution of Cejemly prior to administration and this should be taken into consideration in the context of the daily sodium intake of the patient.

## Polysorbate 80

This medicine contains 4.08 mg of polysorbate 80 in each 1200 mg dose and 5.10 mg polysorbate 80 in each 1500 mg dose. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

## Patient card

All physicians administering sugemalimab must be familiar with the Physician Information and Management Guidelines. The physician must discuss the risks of sugemalimab therapy with the patient. The patient will be provided with the patient card and instructed by the physician to carry the card at all times.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No formal pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction studies have been conducted with sugemalimab. Since sugemalimab is cleared from the circulation through catabolism, no metabolic interactions with other medicinal products are expected.

The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting sugemalimab should be avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of sugemalimab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after starting sugemalimab to treat immune -related adverse reactions (see section 4.4).

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy, and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females

Women of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy during treatment with sugemalimab. Women of childbearing potential receiving sugemalimab should use reliable contraception methods during treatment and for at least 4 months after the last dose of sugemalimab (see below and section 5.3).

## Pregnancy

There are no data on the use of sugemalimab in pregnant women. Animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with sugemalimab. However, blockade of PD-L1 signalling in murine models of pregnancy has been shown to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and to increase foetal loss (see section 5.3).

Sugemalimab is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether sugemalimab is secreted in human milk. Since it is known that antibodies can be secreted in human milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision should be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue sugemalimab treatment, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of sugemalimab therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

No clinical data are available on the possible effects of sugemalimab on fertility. Animal data did not show notable effects on the male and female reproductive organs (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Sugemalimab has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In some patients, fatigue has been reported following administration of sugemalimab (see section 4.8). Patients experiencing fatigue should be advised not to drive and use machines until the symptoms resolved.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

*Grouped  terms  which  refer  to  a  class  effect  of  immune-related  adverse  reaction.  In  clinical  studies  of sugemalimab in monotherapy or combination with chemotherapy, only myelosuppression, blood corticotrophin decreased, and neuritis were observed respectively under immune-related pancytopenia/bicytopenia, hypophysitis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome/demyelination.

# The ADR can be immune-related adverse reaction.

The following terms represent a group of related events that describe a medical condition rather than a single event:

- a. Hypothyroidism (hypothyroidism, blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased, thyroxine free decreased, tri-iodothyronine free decreased)
- b. Hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroidism, blood thyroid stimulating hormone decreased, thyroxine increased, thyroxine free increased, tri-iodothyronine free increased)
- c. Hyperlipidaemia  (hyperlipidaemia,  hypercholesterolaemia,  hypertriglyceridaemia,  blood  triglycerides increased, blood cholesterol increased)
- d. Hyperglycaemia (hyperglycaemia, blood glucose increased)
- e. Hypocalcaemia (hypocalcaemia, blood calcium decreased)
- f. Hyperuricaemia (hyperuricaemia, blood uric acid increased)
- g. Hypochloraemia (hypochloraemia, blood chloride decreased)
- h. Hypoaesthesia (hypoaesthesia, anaesthesia)
- i. Tachycardia  (tachycardia,  sinus  tachycardia,  supraventricular  tachycardia,  atrial  tachycardia,  atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation)
- j. Myocarditis (myocarditis, immune-mediated myocarditis)
- k. Pneumonitis (pneumonitis, immune-mediated lung disease, interstitial lung disease)
- l. Abdominal pain (abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension, abdominal pain upper)
- m. Stomatitis (stomatitis, mouth ulceration)

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates, PD-1/PD-L1 (Programmed cell death protein 1/death ligand 1) inhibitors, ATC code: L01FF11.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Mechanism of action

Sugemalimab is a fully human immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody. It specifically binds to programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), thus blocking its ligation with PD-1. PD-L1, when expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, can contribute to the inhibition of an anti-tumour immune response. Binding of PD-L1 to the PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1) receptors found on T-cells and antigen presenting cells suppresses cytotoxic T-cell activity, T-cell proliferation, and cytokine production. Blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/CD80 interactions releases the inhibition of immune responses without inducing antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## First-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC

GEMSTONE-302: A randomized double-blind study of sugemalimab combined with platinum-based chemotherapy in first-line patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer

The efficacy and safety of sugemalimab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the treatment of adults aged ≥ 18 years with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic (stage IV) squamous or non-squamous NSCLC without sensitising EGFR mutations, ALK fusions, ROS1, or RET translocations was studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study (GEMSTONE-302). Apart from testing for EGFR mutational status in participants with non-squamous NSCLC, testing for genomic tumour aberrations/oncogenic drivers was not mandatory for enrolment. Participants had to provide formalin-fixed tumour tissue samples for PD-L1 assay. The PD-L1 expression was evaluated at a central laboratory by immunohistochemistry using the Ventana PD-L1 (SP263) assay on a BenchMark autostainer assay (Roche Tissue Diagnostics, Oro Valley, AZ, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Participants were excluded if they had history of autoimmune disease, administration of systemic immunosuppressive medicinal product within 2 weeks prior to randomisation and active or untreated CNS metastases.

The primary endpoint of this study was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1. The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), PFS in participants with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% (as assessed by investigators according to RECIST v1.1), objective response rate (ORR) assessed by investigators according to RECIST v1.1, and duration of response (DoR). The type I error was controlled using sequential testing method in the order of PFS, OS, PFS in participants with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, and ORR.

A total of 479 participants were randomly (2:1) assigned to receive:

- for squamous NSCLC, sugemalimab 1200 mg with carboplatin AUC = 5 mg/mL/min and paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 intravenously administered every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles, followed by sugemalimab 1200 mg every 3 weeks
- for non-squamous NSCLC, sugemalimab 1200 mg with carboplatin AUC = 5 mg/mL/min and pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2  intravenously administered every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles followed by sugemalimab 1200 mg and pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2  every 3 weeks

or

- placebo plus the same platinum-based chemotherapy regimens for squamous or non-squamous NSCLC as the group receiving sugemalimab for up to 4 cycles; then followed by placebo for squamous NSCLC, or placebo plus pemetrexed for non-squamous NSCLC.

The maximum duration of treatment with sugemalimab or placebo was 35 cycles (approximately 2 years) or until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, death, or other reasons stipulated in the protocol.

Participants receiving placebo plus chemotherapy who experienced radiographic disease progression confirmed by investigator were able to cross-over to receive sugemalimab monotherapy.

During the first year of the treatment period, imaging assessments were performed at the 6 th week and the 12 th week after the first dose, and every 9 weeks thereafter; after 1 year: imaging assessments were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

performed every 12 weeks until disease progression, loss to follow-up, death, or end of study, whichever occurred first.

All participants were Asian and had Stage IV NSCLC; the median age was 63.0 years; 80.0 % were males; 73.3 % were former or current smokers; 38.8 % were ≥ 65 years; 40.1 % had squamous NSCLC; 59.9 % had non -squamous NSCLC; 60.8 % had PD -L1 expression ≥ 1% of the tumour; 11.9 % had liver metastases at baseline; 14.0 % had brain metastases at baseline; 82.5 % had an ECOG performance status of 1.

The median treatment duration was 10 cycles (range 1 to 49) with a median duration of 7.15 months for sugemalimab versus 6 cycles (range 1 to 44) with a median duration of 4.6 months for placebo. The efficacy results of the GEMSTONE-302 study are summarised in Table 4, Figure 1, and Figure 2.

## Consolidation treatment of unresectable stage III NSCLC

GEMSTONE-301: A randomized double-blind study of sugemalimab as consolidation therapy in patients with unresectable, stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not developed disease progression after receiving concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy

The efficacy and safety of sugemalimab as monotherapy for the treatment of adults aged ≥ 18 years with histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable stage III NSCLC (staged according to the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer [IASLC] classification, version 8) with no sensitising EGFR mutations, or ALK, ROS1 genomic tumour aberrations whose disease has not progressed after receiving concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy was studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study (GEMSTONE-301). Apart from testing for EGFR mutational status in participants with non-squamous NSCLC, testing for genomic tumour aberrations/oncogenic drivers was not mandatory for enrolment. Test for PD-L1 status was not mandatory and was not systematically assessed. Participants had completed at least 2 cycles of definitive platinum-based chemotherapy with radiation therapy within 1 to 42 days prior to initiation of the study. Participants were excluded if they had history of autoimmune disease or administration of systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products (including systemic corticosteroid treatment equivalent to &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone) within 1 week prior to randomisation.

The primary endpoint of this study was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by a blinded independent central review committee (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1. Key secondary endpoint is overall survival (OS).

A total of 381 patients were randomly (2:1) assigned to groups to receive

- sugemalimab 1200 mg intravenously administered every 3 weeks

or

- placebo intravenously administered every 3 weeks

The maximum treatment duration with sugemalimab or placebo study drugs was two years or until progression of the disease or unacceptable toxicity.

During the first year of the treatment period, imaging assessments were performed every 9 weeks; after 1 year: imaging assessments were performed every 12 weeks until disease progression, loss to follow-up, death, or end of study, whichever occurred first.

All participants were Asian and 27.8% had stage IIIa NSCLC , 55.4% had stage IIIb NSCLC, and 16.0% had IIIc NSCLC ; 92.1% were male, and median age was 61 years; 69.8% had squamous NSCLC, 29.7% had nonsquamous NSCLC, 69.6% had an ECOG score of 1. 7.1% were current smoker, 77.7% were former smoker, 15.2% were never smoker. 66.7% received concurrent chemoradiotherapy before randomization, and 33.3% received sequential chemoradiotherapy. Of 175 participants with PDL1 expression available, 54.3% were ≥ 1% and 45.7% were &lt; 1%.

The median treatment duration was 12 cycles (range 1 to 72) with a median duration of 9.0 months for sugemalimab versus 10.0 cycles (range 1 to 60) with a median duration of 7.6 months for placebo.

The study demonstrated a statistically significant prolongation of PFS in the Sugemalimab group compared with the placebo group [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.65 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.84), p = 0.0012] at the final PFS analysis. The updated PFS results with longer follow-up and OS results of the GEMSTONE 301 are summarized in Table 5 and Figure 4. The median follow-up is 39.6 months.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with sugemalimab in the paediatric population in the treatment of lung cancer (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## Immunogenicity

In the phase 3 stage IV NSCLC study (GEMSTONE-302), the prevalence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) was 17 % ( 53 patients), with 9% ( 28 patients) as treatment-emergent ADA.

In the phase 3 stage III NSCLC study (GEMSTONE-301), the prevalence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) was 10.6% (27 patients), with 5.9% (15 patients) as treatment-emergent ADA.

No evidence was observed that ADA had an impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety, however data are still limited.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The PK of sugemalimab was characterised using population PK (PopPK) analysis with concentration data collected from 1002 participants who received sugemalimab doses in the range of 3 to 40 mg/kg and fixed dose of 1200 mg intravenous every 3 weeks.

## Absorption

Sugemalimab is administered by intravenous infusion and therefore is immediately and completely bioavailable.

Following single- and multiple-doses escalation study of sugemalimab (n=29), sugemalimab exposures (AUC and Cmax) increased in an approximately dose proportional manner within the dosing range of 3 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg, including a fixed dose of 1200 mg intravenous every 3 weeks. Following multiple intravenous infusions of 1200 mg every 3 weeks (n=16), there was approximately 2-fold accumulation of sugemalimab exposures (i.e., Racc,Cmax and Racc, AUC were 1.74 and 2.00, respectively).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Distribution

Consistent with a limited extravascular distribution of monoclonal antibodies, the volume of distribution of sugemalimab at steady-state (Vss) from popPK analysis was small.

PopPK analysis estimated the geometric mean (CV%) Vss to be:

- 5.56 L (21%) in Stage IV NSCLC patients (Study GEMSTONE -302).
- 4.74 L (20%) in Stage III NSCLC patients (Study GEMSTONE -301).

## Biotransformation

As an antibody, sugemalimab is catabolised through non-specific pathways; metabolism does not contribute to its clearance.

## Elimination

In the PopPK analysis, geometric mean ( CV%) of total clearance (CL) after a single dose was estimated to be 0.235 L/day (24.2 %) in patients with stage IV NSCLC from Study GEMSTONE-302 and 0.214 L/day (23.8 %) in patients with stage III NSCLC from Study GEMSTONE-301. At steady state, the elimination is slightly lower than after a single dose due to target-mediated drug disposition. Geometric mean ( CV%) of the elimination half-life (t1/2) estimated from the PopPK model was approximately 17.9 days ( 25.6%) at the end of cycle 1 in stage IV NSCLC patients (Study GEMSTONE-302) and 16.6 days (20.8 %) at the end of cycle 1 in stage III NSCLC patients (Study GEMSTONE-301).

## Special populations

## Age, sex, body weight, tumour type, and anti-drug antibodies status

PopPK analysis showed non-statistically significant covariate effects of age (18-78 years) on sugemalimab exposure. The effect of other covariates (albumin, sex, anti-drug antibodies, and tumour type) on the systemic exposure of sugemalimab were not considered clinically meaningful. Based on the results from modelling and simulations, increasing the dosage to 1500 mg Q3W for NSCLC patients with body weight more than 115 kg, is anticipated to achieve comparable exposures to the patients in the pivotal studies that were dosed with 1200 mg Q3W.

## Race

The effect of race in participants with advanced solid tumours (including NSCLC) receiving sugemalimab was evaluated by PopPK analysis and no impact of race was identified on the PK of sugemalimab. More specifically, there was no observed PK difference in sugemalimab between Asian and non-Asian participants.

## Hepatic impairment

The effect of mild hepatic impairment on sugemalimab PK was evaluated using PopPK analyses. Covariate analysis indicated no statistically significant effect of markers of liver function (AST and ALT) on sugemalimab exposure.

## Renal impairment

The effect of renal impairment on the clearance of sugemalimab was evaluated using PopPK analyses in participants with mild or moderate renal impairment compared to participants with normal renal function. There was no impact of renal function on PK of sugemalimab.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

No carcinogenicity or reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with sugemalimab.

Based on literature assessment, the PD-L1/PD-1 signalling pathway plays a role in pregnancy by maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the foetus. In a mouse model of pregnancy, blocking PD-L1 signalling can destroy the immune tolerance to the foetus and increase foetal miscarriages. No foetal malformations associated with blocking PD-L1/PD-1 signalling pathway have been reported in the literature, but immune-related diseases have been observed in PD-1 and PD-L1 gene knockout

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mice. Based on its mechanism of action, foetal exposure to sugemalimab may increase the risk of developing immune-related disorders or altering normal immune responses.

In 4- and 26-week repeat-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, exposure to sugemalimab administered IV once weekly, reveals no special hazard except two ophthalmic observations in high dose females: 1 incidence of retinal depigmentation and 1 case of medium-sized focal cornea opacity at 200 mg/kg, which corresponds to approximately 16-fold and 18-fold the clinical AUC at human recommended clinical dose.

- has spread within your lung and cannot be removed by surgery, and has responded or stabilised after initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

It is used in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy when your lung cancer:

- has spread and cannot be removed by surgery It is important that you read the package leaflets for the other anticancer medicines you may be receiving.

## How Cejemly works

PD-L1 is found on the surface of certain tumour cells, and suppresses the body`s immune (defense) system, thereby protecting cancer cells from being attacked by the immune cells. Cejemly attaches to PD-L1 and helps your immune system to fight your cancer.
