| II/0065/G          | This was an application for a group of variations. Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC in order to include a new warning on possible false positive testing of assays used for diagnosis of fungal infections depending on detection of beta-D-glucans and to amend the existing warning on aseptic meningitis syndrome. Minor changes are made to the existing warnings on thromboembolic events and acute renal failure. The RMP is updated in relation to the new warning and to include the changes requested during the assessment of variation | 24/09/2015 | 02/06/2016 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | Based on new safety data the manufacturer proposes an update of the Product Information. The changes reflect the possibility of false positive readings in detection of ß-d- glucans for diagnosis of fungal infections, the higher incidence of aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) in female patients and its lack of dependency on dosage of administered immunoglobulin. They also make treating physicians more aware of thromboembolism and renal failure in patients requiring intravenous immunoglobulins. Due to new safety information with KIOVIG the list of adverse events has been updated. |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

|         | Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to revise the frequency and MedRA SOC categorisation of adverse drug reactions based on information from several clinical studies in which KIOVIG was used as investigational medicinal product. Safety information from clinical trials is deleted from section 4.8 of the SmPC for simplification. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The MAH took also the opportunity to implement QRD version 9.1 and to update the details of the local representative for Slovakia.

Stroke and myocardial infarction have also been included as new ADRs based on post-marketing spontaneous reporting; PL has been updated accordingly. Editorial changes have been made to section 4.2 of the SmPC.and paediatric statements have been included to sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 4.9 and 5.1 of the SmPC as per previous commitments during variation IB/46.

As a result of the data analysis, frequencies and frequency categories have been changed for a few of the already reported ADRs in the PI, which was updated accordingly. Addition of stroke and myocardial infarction has been due to two reports of stroke and two reports of MI from post-marketing sources and the MAH has now incorporated them in the ADR list within frequency |
