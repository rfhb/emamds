## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

M-M-RvaxPro is indicated for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella in individuals from 12 months of age (see section 4.2).

M-M-RvaxPro can be administered to infants from 9 months of age under special circumstances (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).

For use in measles outbreaks, or for post-exposure vaccination, or, for use in previously unvaccinated individuals older than 9 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant women, and persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella, see section 5.1.

M-M-RvaxPro is to be used on the basis of official recommendations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Posology

- Individuals 12 months of age or older:

Individuals 12 months or older should receive one dose at an elected date. A second dose may be administered at least 4 weeks after the first dose in accordance with of ficial recommendation. The second dose is intended for individuals who did not respond to the first dose for any reason.

- Infants between 9 and 12 months of age:

Immunogenicity and safety data show that M-M-RvaxPro can be administered to infants between 9 and 12 months of age, in accordance with official recommendations or when an early protection is considered necessary (e.g., day-care, outbreak situations, or travel to a region with high prevalence of measles). Such infants should be revaccinated at 12 to 15 months of age. An additional dose with a measles-containing vaccine should be considered according to official recommendations (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

- Infants below 9 months of age: No data on the efficacy and safety of M-M-RvaxPro for use in children below 9 months of age are currently available.

## Method of administration

The vaccine is to be injected intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC).

The preferred injection sites are the anterolateral area of the thigh in younger children and the deltoid area in older children, adolescents, and adults.

The vaccine should be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder.

For precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product, and for instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## DO NOT INJECT INTRAVASCULARLY.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to any measles, mumps, or rubella vaccine, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, including neomycin (see sections 2 and 4.4).

Pregnancy. Furthermore, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination (see section 4.6).

Vaccination should be postponed during any illness with fever &gt; 38.5 °C.

Active untreated tuberculosis. Children under treatment for tuberculosis have not experienced exacerbation of the disease when immunised with live measles virus vaccine. No studies have been reported to date on the ef fect of measles virus vaccines on children with untreated tuberculosis.

Blood dyscrasias, leukaemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the haematopoietic and lymphatic systems.

Current immunosuppressive therapy (including high doses of corticosteroids). M-M-RvaxPro is not contraindicated in individuals who are receiving topical or low-dose parenteral corticosteroids (e.g., for asthma prophylaxis or replacement therapy).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Severe humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodeficiency, e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency, agammaglobulinemia and AIDS or symptomatic HIV infection or an age-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage in children below 12 months: CD4+ &lt; 25%; children between 12-35 months: CD4+ &lt; 20%; children between 36-59 months: CD4+ &lt; 15% (see section 4.4).

In severely immunocompromised individuals inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing vaccine, measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence of disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported.

Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of  the vaccine (see section 4.8).

Adults and adolescents with a history of allergies may potentially be at increased risk of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions. Close monitoring is recommended following vaccination for the early signs of such reactions.

Since live measles vaccine and live mumps vaccine are produced in chick embryo cell culture, persons with a history of anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or other immediate reactions (e.g., hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) subsequent to egg ingestion may be at an enhanced risk of immediate type hypersensitivity reactions. The potential risk to benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such cases.

Due caution should be employed in administration of M-M-RvaxPro to persons with individual or family history of convulsions, or a history of cerebral injury. The physician should be alert to the temperature elevation that may occur following vaccination (see section 4.8).

Infants from 9 to 12 months of age vaccinated with a measles-containing vaccine during measles outbreaks or for other reasons may fail to respond to the vaccine due to the presence of circulating antibodies of maternal origin and/or immaturity of the immune system (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).

## Thrombocytopenia

This vaccine should be given subcutaneously to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder because bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. Individuals with current thrombocytopenia may develop more severe thrombocytopenia following vaccination. In addition, individuals who experienced thrombocytopenia with the first dose of M-M-RvaxPro (or its component vaccines) may develop thrombocytopenia with repeat doses. Serologic status may be evaluated to determine whether or not additional doses of vaccine are needed. The potential risk to benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such cases (see section 4.8).

## Other

Vaccination may be considered in patients with selected immune deficiencies where the benefits outweigh the risks (asymptomatic HIV patients, IgG subclass deficiencies, congenital neutropenia, chronic granulomatous disease, and complement deficiency diseases).

Immunocompromised patients who have no contraindication for this vaccination (see section 4.3) may not respond as well as immunocompetent patients; therefore, some of these patients may acquire

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

measles, mumps, or rubella in case of contact, despite appropriate vaccine administration. These patients should be monitored carefully for signs of measles, parotitis, and rubella.

Vaccination with M-M-RvaxPro may not result in protection in all vaccinees.

## Transmission

Excretion of small amounts of the live attenuated rubella virus f rom the nose or throat has occurred in the majority of susceptible individuals 7 to 28 days af ter vaccination. There is no confirmed evidence to indicate that such virus is transmitted to susceptible persons who are in contact with the vaccinated individuals. Consequently, transmission through close personal contact, while accepted as a theoretical possibility, is not regarded as a signif icant risk; however, transmission of the rubella vaccine virus to infants via breast milk has been documented without any evidence of clinical disease (see section 4.6).

There are no reports of  transmission of  the more attenuated Enders' Edmonston strain of  measles virus or the Jeryl Lynn strain of mumps virus from vaccinees to susceptible contacts.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 milligrams) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'.

## Potassium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 milligrams) per dose, that is to say essentially ' potassium-free '.

## Sorbitol (E 420)

This medicinal product contains 14.5 milligrams of sorbitol per dose. The additive eff ect of concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into account.

Interf erence with laboratory tests: see section 4.5.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Immune globulin

Immune globulin (Ig) is not to be given concomitantly with M-M-RvaxPro.

Administration of immune globulins concomitantly with M-M-RvaxPro may interfere with the expected immune response. Vaccination should be deferred for at least 3 months following blood or plasma transfusions, or administration of human immune serum globulin.

Administration of measles, mumps, or rubella antibody-containing blood products, including immune globulin preparations, should be avoided within 1 month after a dose of M-M-RvaxPro unless considered to be essential.

## Laboratory tests

It has been reported that live attenuated measles, mumps and rubella virus vaccines given individually may result in a temporary depression of tuberculin skin sensitivity. Therefore, if a tuberculin test is to be done, it should be administered either any time before, simultaneously with, or 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with M-M-RvaxPro.

## Concomitant administration with other vaccines

M-M-RvaxPro can be given concomitantly with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

Published clinical data support concomitant administration of the previous formulation of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ 07065, USA (herein after MSD) with other childhood vaccinations, including DTaP (or DTwP), IPV (or OPV),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

HIB ( Haemophilus influenzae type b), HIB-HBV ( Haemophilus influenzae type b with Hepatitis B vaccine), and VAR (varicella).

Based on clinical studies with the quadrivalent measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine and with the previous formulation of the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine manufactured by MSD, M-M-RvaxPro can be given concomitantly with a hepatitis A vaccine. In these clinical studies, it was demonstrated that the immune responses were unaffected and that the overall safety profiles of the administered vaccines were similar.

Since M-M-RvaxPro has been shown to have safety and immunogenicity profiles similar to the previous formulation of the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine manufactured by MSD, experience with this vaccine can be considered.

M-M-RvaxPro should be given concomitantly at separate injection sites, or one month before or after administration of other live virus vaccines.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

Pregnant women should not be vaccinated with M-M-RvaxPro.

Studies have not been conducted with M-M-RvaxPro in pregnant women.

In a review of more than 3 500 susceptible women who were unknowingly in early stages of pregnancy when vaccinated with a rubella-containing vaccine, no cases of congenital rubella syndrome were reported. Subsequent post-marketing surveillance identified congenital rubella syndrome associated with a rubella vaccine strain following inadvertent vaccination of a pregnant woman with a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.

Foetal damage has not been documented when measles or mumps vaccines have been given to pregnant women.

Inadvertent vaccination of unknowingly pregnant women with measles-, mumps-, or rubella-containing vaccines should not be a reason for termination of pregnancy.

Pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination. Women who intend to become pregnant should be advised to delay.

## Breast-feeding

Studies have shown that breast-feeding postpartum women vaccinated with live attenuated rubella vaccines may secrete the virus in breast milk and transmit it to breast-fed infants. In the infants with serological evidence of rubella infection, none had symptomatic disease. It is not known whether measles or mumps vaccine virus is secreted in human milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when M-M-RvaxPro is administered to a breast-feeding woman.

## Fertility

M-M-RvaxPro has not been evaluated in fertility studies.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been perf ormed. M-M-RvaxPro is expected to have no or negligible inf luence on the ability to drive and use machines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## a. Summary of the safety profile

In clinical trials, M-M-RvaxPro was administered to 1 965 children (see section 5.1), and the general safety profile was comparable to the previous formulation of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine manufactured by MSD.

In a clinical trial, 752 children received M-M-RvaxPro, either intramuscularly or subcutaneously. The general safety profile of either administration routes were comparable, although injection site reactions were less frequent in the IM group (15.8%) compared with the SC group (25.8%).

All adverse reactions were evaluated in 1 940 children. Among these children, the vaccine-related adverse reactions, summarised in section b, were observed in individuals following vaccination with M-M-RvaxPro (excluding isolated reports with frequency &lt; 0.2%).

In comparison to the first dose, a second dose of M-M-RvaxPro is not associated with an increase in the incidence and severity of clinical symptoms including those suggestive of hypersensitivity reaction.

Additionally, other adverse reactions reported with post-marketing use of M-M-RvaxPro and/or in clinical studies and post-marketing use of previous formulations of monovalent and of the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccines manufactured by MSD without regard to causality or frequency are available and are summarised in section b. The frequency of these adverse events is qualif ied as \"not known\" when it cannot be estimated based on the available data. These data were reported based on more than 400 million doses distributed worldwide.

The most common adverse reactions reported with the use of M-M-RvaxPro were: fever (38.5 °C or higher); injection site reactions including pain, swelling and erythema.

## b. Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: [Very common (≥ 1/10); Common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); Uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)]

† see section c

## c. Description of selected adverse reactions

## Aseptic meningitis

Cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported following measles, mumps and rubella vaccination. Although a causal relationship between other strains of mumps vaccine and aseptic meningitis has been shown, there is no evidence to link Jeryl Lynn mumps vaccine to aseptic meningitis.

## Encephalitis and Encephalopathy

In severely immunocompromised individuals inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing vaccine, measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence of disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported (see section 4.3); disseminated mumps and rubella vaccine virus infection has also been reported.

## Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis

There is no evidence that measles vaccine can cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). There have been reports of SSPE in children who did not have a history of infection with wild-type measles but did receive measles vaccine. Some of these cases may have resulted from unrecognised measles in the first year of lif e or possibly f rom the measles vaccination. The results of a retrospective case-controlled study conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that the overall effect of measles vaccine has been to protect against SSPE by preventing measles with its inherent risk of SSPE.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Arthralgia and/or arthritis

Arthralgia and/or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic), and polyneuritis are f eatures of infection with wild-type rubella and vary in f requency and severity with age and sex, being greatest in adult f emales and least in prepubertal children. Following vaccination in children, reactions in joints are generally uncommon (0-3%) and of brief duration. In women, incidence rates for arthritis and arthralgia are generally higher than those seen in children (12-20%), and the reactions tend to be more marked and of longer duration. Symptoms may persist for a matter of months or on rare occasions for years. In adolescent girls, the reactions appear to be intermediate in incidence between those seen in children and adult women. Even in older women (35-45 years), these reactions are generally well tolerated and rarely interfere with normal activities.

## Chronic arthritis

Chronic arthritis has been associated with wild-type rubella infection and has been related to persistent virus and/or viral antigen isolated from body tissues. Only rarely have vaccine recipients developed chronic joint symptoms.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Administration of a higher than recommended dose of M-M-RvaxPro was reported rarely and the adverse reaction profile was comparable to that observed with the recommended dose of M-M-RvaxPro.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Viral vaccine, ATC code J07BD52

## Evaluation of immunogenicity and clinical ef ficacy

A comparative study in 1 279 subjects who received M-M-RvaxPro or the previous formulation (manufactured with human serum albumin) of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine manufactured by MSD demonstrated similar immunogenicity and safety between the 2 products.

Clinical studies of 284 triple seronegative children, 11 months to 7 years of  age, demonstrated that the previous formulation of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine manufactured by MSD is highly immunogenic and generally well tolerated. In these studies, a single injection of the vaccine induced measles haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies in 95%, mumps neutralising antibodies in 96%, and rubella HI antibodies in 99% of susceptible persons.

Evaluation of immunogenicity in children from 9 to 12 months of age at the time of first dose A clinical study was conducted with the quadrivalent measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine manufactured by MSD administered with a 2-dose schedule, the doses being given 3 months apart in 1 620 healthy subjects from 9 to 12 months of age at the time of first dose. The saf ety prof ile postdose 1 and 2 was generally comparable for all age cohorts.

In the Full Analysis Set (vaccinated subjects regardless of their antibody titre at baseline), high seroprotection rates of &gt; 99% were elicited to mumps and rubella post-dose 2, regardless of the age of the vaccinee at the f irst dose. Af ter 2 doses, the seroprotection rates against measles were 98.1% when the first dose was given at 11 months compared to 98.9% when the first dose was given at 12 months (non-inferiority study objective met). Af ter two doses, the seroprotection rates against measles were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

94.6% when the first dose was given at 9 months compared to 98.9% when the first dose was given at 12 months (non-inferiority study objective not met).

The seroprotection rates to measles, mumps and rubella for the Full Analysis Set are given in Table 1.

The post-dose 2 geometric mean titres (GMTs) against mumps and rubella were comparable across all age categories, while the GMTs against measles were lower in subjects who received the first dose at 9 months of age as compared to subjects who received the first dose at 11 or 12 months of age.

A comparative study in 752 subjects who received M-M-RvaxPro either by intramuscular route or subcutaneous route demonstrated a similar immunogenicity profile between both administration routes.

The efficacy of the components of the previous formulation of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine manufactured by MSD was established in a series of double-blind controlled field trials, which demonstrated a high degree of protective efficacy afforded by the individual vaccine components. These studies also established that seroconversion in response to vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella paralleled protection from these diseases.

## Post-exposure vaccination

Vaccination of individuals exposed to wild-type measles may provide some protection if the vaccine can be administered within 72 hours after exposure. If, however, the vaccine is given a f ew days before exposure, substantial protection may be afforded. There is no conclusive evidence that vaccination of individuals recently exposed to wild-type mumps or wild-type rubella will provide protection.

## Effectiveness

More than 400 million doses of the previous formulation of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine manufactured by MSD have been distributed worldwide (1978 to 2003). Widespread use of a 2-dose vaccination schedule in the United States and countries such as Finland and Sweden has led to a &gt; 99% reduction in the incidence of each of the 3 targeted diseases.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Non-pregnant adolescent and adult females

Vaccination of susceptible non-pregnant adolescent and adult females of childbearing age with live attenuated rubella virus vaccine is indicated if  certain precautions are observed (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). Vaccinating susceptible postpubertal females confers individual protection against subsequently acquiring rubella infection during pregnancy, which, in turn, prevents inf ection of  the foetus and consequent congenital rubella injury.

Previously unvaccinated individuals older than 9 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant women should receive live attenuated rubella-containing vaccine (such as M-M-RvaxPro or a monovalent rubella vaccine) to reduce the risk of exposure of the pregnant woman.

## Individuals likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella

M-M-RvaxPro is preferred for vaccination of persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella. Individuals who require vaccination against measles can receive M-M-RvaxPro regardless of their immune status to mumps or rubella if a monovalent measles vaccine is not readily available.

## Concomitant administration

In a double-blind, active comparator-controlled study (Protocol V114-029), 1 720 healthy infants were randomised to receive Vaxneuvance (a 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV)) or a 13valent PCV. The infants also received standard paediatric vaccines, including M-M-RvaxPro which was administered concomitantly with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine at 12 to 15 months of age.

## M-M-RvaxPro

## Powder and solvent for suspension for injection

Measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (live)

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you or your child is vaccinated because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or your pharmacist.
- -If  you get any of the side ef f ects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side ef f ects not listed in this leaf let. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What M-M-RvaxPro is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you receive M-M-RvaxPro
3. How to use M-M-RvaxPro
4. Possible side eff ects
5. How to store M-M-RvaxPro
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What M-M-RvaxPro is and what it is used for

M-M-RvaxPro is a vaccine containing measles, mumps and rubella viruses that have been weakened. When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defences) will make antibodies against the measles, mumps and rubella viruses. The antibodies help protect against infections caused by these viruses.

M-M-RvaxPro is given to help protect you or your child against measles, mumps and rubella. The vaccine may be administered to persons 12 months of age or older.

M-M-RvaxPro can be administered to infants from 9 to 12 months of age under special circumstances.

M-M-RvaxPro can also be used in measles outbreaks, or for post-exposure vaccination, or for use in previously unvaccinated persons older than 9 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant women, and persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella.

Although M-M-RvaxPro contains live viruses, they are too weak to cause measles, mumps, or rubella in healthy people.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive M-M-RvaxPro

## Do not use M-M-RvaxPro

- -if  the person to be vaccinated is allergic to any measles, mumps or rubella vaccine or to any of the ingredients of  this vaccine (listed in section 6) including neomycin
- -if  the person to be vaccinated is pregnant (in addition, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month after vaccination, see Pregnancy and breast-f eeding)
- -if  the person to be vaccinated has any illness with f ever higher than 38.5 °C; however, low-grade fever itself is not a reason to delay vaccination
- -if  the person to be vaccinated has active untreated tuberculosis
- -if  the person to be vaccinated has a blood disorder or any type of cancer that aff ects the immune system
- -if  the person to be vaccinated is receiving treatment or taking medicines that may weaken the immune system (except low-dose corticosteroid therapy for asthma or replacement therapy)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -if  the person to be vaccinated has a weakened immune system because of a disease (including AIDS)
- -if  the person to be vaccinated has a f amily history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of the person to be vaccinated is demonstrated.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to the doctor or pharmacist before the person to be vaccinated receives M-M-RvaxPro if he/she has experienced any of the following:

- -an allergic reaction to eggs or anything that contained egg
- -a history or family history of allergies or of convulsions (fits)
- -a side effect af ter vaccination with measles, mumps and/or rubella vaccine that involved easy bruising or bleeding for longer than usual
- -an infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) but do not show symptoms of HIV disease. The vaccinated person should be monitored closely for measles, mumps and rubella because vaccination may be less effective than for uninfected persons (see section Do not use M-M-RvaxPro ).

As with other vaccines, M-M-RvaxPro may not completely protect all persons who are vaccinated. Also, if the person who is to be vaccinated has already been exposed to the measles, mumps, or rubella virus but is not yet ill, M-M-RvaxPro may not be able to prevent the illness from appearing.

M-M-RvaxPro can be given to persons who have been in recent (within 3 days) contact with a case of measles and may be incubating the disease. However, M-M-RvaxPro may not always be able to prevent measles developing in these cases.

## Other medicines and M-M-RvaxPro

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if the person to be vaccinated is taking or has recently taken any other medicines (or other vaccines).

The doctor may delay vaccination for at least 3 months following blood or plasma transfusions, or administration of immune globulin (known as Ig). After vaccination with M-M-RvaxPro, Ig should not be given for 1 month, unless your doctor tells you otherwise.

If a tuberculin test is to be perf ormed, it should be done either any time before, simultaneously with, or 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with M-M-RvaxPro.

M-M-RvaxPro may be given with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and/or hepatitis A vaccine at the same visit at separate injection sites (e.g., the other arm or leg).

M-M-RvaxPro may be given with some routine childhood vaccines that may be due to be given at the same time. For vaccines that cannot be given at the same time, M-M-RvaxPro should be given 1 month before or after administration of those vaccines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

M-M-RvaxPro should not be given to pregnant females. Females of childbearing age should take the necessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for 1 month, or according to doctor's recommendation, af ter they have been given the vaccine.

Persons who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed should tell the doctor. The doctor will decide if M-M-RvaxPro should be given.

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this vaccine.

## Driving and using machines

There is no information to suggest that M-M-RvaxPro affects the ability to drive or operate machinery.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 milligrams) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'.

## 3. How to use M-M-RvaxPro

M-M-RvaxPro should be injected into the muscle or under the skin either in the area of the outer thigh or of the upper arm. Usually for injections into the muscle the thigh area is preferred in young children whereas for older individuals the upper arm area is the pref erred injection site. M-M-RvaxPro is not to be injected directly into any blood vessel.

## M-M-RvaxPro is given as follows:

One dose is given at an elected date usually f rom 12 months of age. Under special circumstances, it can be given from 9 months of ag e. Further doses should be administered according to your doctor's recommendation. The interval between 2 doses should be at least 4 weeks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

Before mixing with the solvent, the powder vaccine is a light yellow compact crystalline cake. The solvent is a clear colourless liquid. When completely reconstituted, the vaccine is a clear yellow liquid.

To reconstitute the vaccine, use the solvent supplied.

It is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle f or each patient to prevent transmission of infectious agents from one individual to another.

One needle should be used for reconstitution and a separate, new needle for injection.

The reconstituted vaccine must not be used if any particulate matter is noted or if the appearance of the solvent or powder or of the reconstituted vaccine diff ers from that described above.

## After reconstitution, it is recommended to administer the vaccine immediately to minimise loss of potency, or within 8 hours if stored in a refrigerator.

## Do not freeze the reconstituted vaccine.

Withdraw the entire content of the reconstituted vaccine f rom the vial into a syringe, change the needle and inject the entire volume by subcutaneous or intramuscular route.

Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you or your child is vaccinated because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What M-M-RvaxPro is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you receive M-M-RvaxPro
3. How to use M-M-RvaxPro
4. Possible side eff ects

6. Content of the pack and other information

## 1. What M-M-RvaxPro is and what it is used for

M-M-RvaxPro is a vaccine containing measles, mumps and rubella viruses that have been weakened. When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defences) will make antibodies against the measles, mumps and rubella viruses. The antibodies help protect against infections caused by these viruses.

M-M-RvaxPro is given to help protect you or your child against measles, mumps and rubella. The vaccine may be administered to persons 12 months of age or older.

M-M-RvaxPro can be administered to infants from 9 to 12 months of age under special circumstances.

M-M-RvaxPro can also be used in measles outbreaks, or for post-exposure vaccination, or for use in previously unvaccinated persons older than 9 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant women, and persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella.

Although M-M-RvaxPro contains live viruses, they are too weak to cause measles, mumps, or rubella in healthy people.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive M-M-RvaxPro

## Do not use M-M-RvaxPro:

- -if  the person to be vaccinated is allergic to any measles, mumps or rubella vaccine or to any of the ingredients of  this vaccine (listed in section 6) including neomycin
- -if  the person to be vaccinated is pregnant (in addition, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month after vaccination, see Pregnancy and breast-f eeding)
- -if  the person to be vaccinated has any illness with f ever higher than 38.5 °C; however, low-grade fever itself is not a reason to delay vaccination
- -if  the person to be vaccinated has active untreated tuberculosis
- -if  the person to be vaccinated has a blood disorder or any type of cancer that aff ects the immune system
- -if  the person to be vaccinated is receiving treatment or taking medicines that may weaken the immune system (except low-dose corticosteroid therapy for asthma or replacement therapy)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -if  the person to be vaccinated has a weakened immune system because of a disease (including AIDS)
- -if  the person to be vaccinated has a f amily history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of the person to be vaccinated is demonstrated.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to the doctor or pharmacist before the person to be vaccinated receives M-M-RvaxPro if he/she has experienced any of the following:

- -an allergic reaction to eggs or anything that contained egg
- -a history or family history of allergies or of convulsions (fits)
- -a side effect af ter vaccination with measles, mumps and/or rubella vaccine that involved easy bruising or bleeding for longer than usual
- -an infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) but do not show symptoms of HIV disease. The vaccinated person should be monitored closely for measles, mumps and rubella because vaccination may be less effective than for uninfected persons (see section Do not use M-M-RvaxPro ).

As with other vaccines, M-M-RvaxPro may not completely protect all persons who are vaccinated. Also, if the person who is to be vaccinated has already been exposed to the measles, mumps, or rubella virus but is not yet ill, M-M-RvaxPro may not be able to prevent the illness from appearing.

M-M-RvaxPro can be given to persons who have been in recent (within 3 days) contact with a case of measles and may be incubating the disease. However, M-M-RvaxPro may not always be able to prevent measles developing in these cases.

## Other medicines and M-M-RvaxPro

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if the person to be vaccinated is taking or has recently taken any other medicines (or other vaccines).

The doctor may delay vaccination for at least 3 months following blood or plasma transfusions, or administration of immune globulin (known as Ig). After vaccination with M-M-RvaxPro, Ig should not be given for 1 month, unless your doctor tells you otherwise.

If a tuberculin test is to be perf ormed, it should be done either any time before, simultaneously with, or 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with M-M-RvaxPro.

M-M-RvaxPro may be given with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and/or hepatitis A vaccine at the same visit at separate injection sites (e.g., the other arm or leg).

M-M-RvaxPro may be given with some routine childhood vaccines that may be due to be given at the same time. For vaccines that cannot be given at the same time, M-M-RvaxPro should be given 1 month before or after administration of those vaccines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

M-M-RvaxPro should not be given to pregnant females. Females of childbearing age should take the necessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for 1 month, or according to doctor's recommendation, af ter they have been given the vaccine.

Persons who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed should tell the doctor. The doctor will decide if M-M-RvaxPro should be given.

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this vaccine.

## Driving and using machines

There is no information to suggest that M-M-RvaxPro affects the ability to drive or operate machinery.
