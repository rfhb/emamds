## Scientific conclusions

Taking  into  account  the  PRAC  Assessment  Report  on  the  PSUR(s)  for  trabectedin,  the  scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) is a rare entity characterized by recurrent and unpredictable attacks of capillary  leakage  of  plasma  fluid  and  proteins  throughout  the  endothelium.  Capillary  leak  syndrome (CLS)  is  usually  characterized  by  peripheral  oedema,  hypotension  which  is  relatively  well  tolerated, oliguria with acute pre-renal failure. In some patients, a compartment syndrome can occur. CLS can be idiopathic (Clarkson's disease) or secondary to various conditions and treatments. Secondary CLSs are mostly due to malignant hematological diseases, viral infections, and treatments such as chemotherapies and therapeutic growth factors.

Based  on  an  ad-hoc  review  of  CLS  cases  performed  by  an  External  Independent  Adjudication Committee (IAC), it was determined possible or probable trabectedin causality in 5 out of 6 fatal cases among  14  probable  CLS  cases.  The  Pharmacovigilance  and  Risk  Assessment  Committee  (PRAC) considered  the  results  of  the  IAC  report  highly  credible.  The  3  assessors  are  independent,  have  no conflict  of  interest,  are  all  specialists  on  CLS,  and  they  provided  a  relevant  description  of  their methodology and criteria, a distinction between possible and probable CLS and for the probable CLS cases,  that  are  fatal,  an  evaluation  of  trabectedin  causality.  Their  finding  of  possible  or  probable trabectedin causality in 5 of 6 fatal cases among 14 probable CLS cases warrants an update of the SmPC within this procedure to reflect there are cases with a fatal outcome.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for trabectedin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance  of  the  medicinal  product(s)  containing  trabectedin  is  unchanged  subject  to  the  proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
