## 1. Introduction

On 10 May 2016, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, the MAH submitted  the  final  study  report  of  study  PN002  ( 'Randomized,  Phase  II  Study  of  MK-3475  versus Chemotherapy in Patients with Advanced Melanoma ' ) in which one patient at the start of treatment with KEYTRUDA was included.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study P002 'Randomized, Phase II Study of MK-3475 versus Chemotherapy in Patients with Advanced Melanoma ' is stand-alone study.

A positive PDCO Opinion was granted for the pembrolizumab pediatric investigation plan (PIP) on 14 Feb 2014 and the EMA decision was received on 7 Mar 2014. The condition for this PIP is treatment of all conditions included in the category of malignant neoplasms (except nervous system, haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue), with the two following indications:

- Treatment of advanced, untreatable or previously treated malignant melanoma in children from 12 year old to &lt;18 years of age
- Treatment  as  monotherapy  of  a  PD-L1  positive  paediatric  malignant  solid  tumor  in  children from 6 months to less than 18 years of age

The pembrolizumab development in paediatric solid tumors is currently ongoing in the Phase 1/2 study P051.  Because  melanoma  is  rare  in  children,  as  many  children  with  melanoma  as  feasible  will  be enrolled in this study, and efficacy results will be compared to data with pembrolizumab in the adult melanoma studies. The PIP also seeks to identify additional paediatric tumors that could be amenable to anti-PD-1 therapy. Thus,  study P051 will also enroll any advanced, relapsed or refractory PDL1positive solid tumor or lymphoma to look for signals of efficacy within a given tumor indication. A safe and  tolerated  dose  in  children  will  be  selected  that  assures  a  similar  exposure  to  adults  at  the recommended phase 2 dose, and that the pharmacodynamic (IL-2 release assay) target is also met.

At the conclusion of Study P051 (Part 2), responses in each enrolled tumor type will be evaluated in order to select a solid tumor for further efficacy and safety investigation.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Pembrolizumab was provided as 50 mg lyophilized drug in vials to be reconstituted in sterile water and then diluted further in normal saline for IV administration.

A  specific  formulation  will  not  be  developed,  as  the  available  IV  is  considered  appropriate  for  the paediatric population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The final results of study P002 have been submitted as a Clinical Study Report (CSR), in accordance with  Article  46  of  the  EU  Paediatric  Regulation  (EC  No  1901/2006)  which  requires  that  any  MAHsponsored study which involves the use in the paediatric population of a medicinal product covered by a marketing authorization, whether or not they are conducted in compliance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan, is to be submitted to the competent authority within 6 months of study completion (last subject last visit for P002 was 16-Nov-2015).

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study P002: Randomized, Phase II Study of MK-3475 versus Chemotherapy in Patients with Advanced Melanoma

## Description

P002 is a randomized, Phase 2 study of pembrolizumab vs. chemotherapy in subjects with advanced melanoma refractory to ipilimumab (IPI). Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive blinded pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, or chemotherapy (Investigator choices).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Objective(s)

The study objective was to evaluate the overall benefit of pembrolizumab compared to control.

## Study population /Sample size

The study included male and female subjects ≥ 18 years old, with a histological or cytological diagnosis of  melanoma  and  progressive  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  disease  that  was  not  amenable  to definitive local therapy with curative intent.

Patients were  eligible only if ipilimumab-refractory (progression documented  in  two separate assessment and following at least 2 doses of IPI  at a minimum dose of 3 mg/kg and within 6 months of the last dose of IPI). In addition, patients with BRAF V600 mutant melanoma must have had a prior treatment  regimen  that  included  vemurafenib,  dabrafenib,  or  other  approved  BRAF  and/or  MEK inhibitors.

The age eligibility in the original protocol of ≥ 16 years old was amended (version 01) to ≥ 18 years due to difficulty enrolling younger subjects as well as requests from country agencies and IRBs/IRCs.

At the time that study eligibility required that subjects be ≥ 18 years old, an exception was granted for oneyea  younger  subject  with  advanced,  IPI-refractory  melanoma.  This  protocol  deviation  was requested  based  on  there  being  no  available  alternative  therapies.  The  subject  was  allowed  to  be randomized in the trial by the IRB/IEC and this was authorized by the Sponsor based on the medical need.

The sample size calculation (510 patients randomized 1:1:1, with 170 subjects per arm) was based on the assumption of an HR of 0.65 between each of the MK-3475 arms and chemotherapy arm.

## Treatments

Patients were randomized to one of the following 3 treatment arms:

- a) Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every three weeks
- b) Pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every three weeks

c)  Investigator-choice  standard  of  care  (SOC)  chemotherapy  (supplied  locally).  The  chemotherapy options  were  initially  carboplatin  in  combination  with  paclitaxel,  carboplatin  monotherapy,  paclitaxel monotherapy, dacarbazine, temozolomide IV, or oral temozolomide. Protocol amendment 01 removed carboplatin monotherapy and temozolomide IV in response to regulatory agency feedback.

An integrated radiology and oncology (IRO) assessment was used as the primary method of analysis. This assessment included the review of images by independent radiologists and the review of objective clinical  data  by  an  independent  oncologist  (e.g.  qualitative  skin  photographs,  biopsy  reports  from suspicious lesions if performed) when such data were available.

Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 Keytruda

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Radiological assessment per RECIST 1.1 of tumor response status was performed starting at Week 12 following the initial  dose of  study  medication, and then every 6  weeks until Week 48 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Crossover to pembrolizumab was permitted starting at Week 12 for subjects in the chemotherapy control arm who had PD confirmed by central imaging review.

## Outcomes/endpoints

There were two primary endpoints in this study, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  The  overall  type  I  error  rate  for  this  study  was  strictly  controlled  at  2.5%  (one-sided)  that allowed the trial to declare positive in either or both of the two primary endpoints (PFS and OS) at either of the two pembrolizumab dose levels.

Progression-Free-Survival : PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented PD (based on assessment from a central imaging vendor using the RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. For the primary PFS analysis, subjects without PD, death, or new anti-cancer  treatment  were  censored  at  the  last  disease  assessment;  for  subjects  who  started  new anti-cancer treatment, subjects were censored at the last disease assessment before starting new anticancer treatment; for subjects with missing disease assessments, events were considered on the date PD or death was documented.

Analysis of PFS based on Investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1 was performed as a supportive analysis.  For  subjects  whose  subsequent  assessments  right  after  RECIST-defined  PD  showed  stable disease or better and who remained on study treatment, a sensitivity analysis was conducted that did not count the initial RECIST-defined PD assessment as an event.

Overall Survival : OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Subjects without documented death at the time of the analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up.

The secondary endpoints were Overall response rate (ORR) based on confirmed assessments from a central imaging vendor review using the RECIST 1.1 criteria and Response Duration .

Additional exploratory endpoints included:

- Response rate, response duration, PFS and OS following crossover to pembrolizumab.
- Response rate by Week 12, PFS and OS in the biomarker (PD-L1 high expression) subgroup.
- European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC-QLQ C30), European Quality of Life five dimensions questionnaire (EuroQoL EQ-5D), and tumor volumetric changes at Week 12.

For the evaluation of OS, PFS and ORR in the PD-L1 positive subgroup, the PD-L1 cutoff point was defined and validated using data from the melanoma subjects in P001. PD-L1 positive was defined as Allred proportion score (APS) of 2 or higher and PD-L1 negative is defined as APS of 0 or 1.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

## Baseline data

The  only  paediatric  patient  enrolled  in  the  trial  was  a  male  subject  with  BRAF  wild-type  mucosal melanoma metastatic at baseline. For advanced melanoma, the subject had ipilimumab induction and maintenance treatment.

## Efficacy results

The  patient  was  randomized  in  the  pembrolizumab  2  mg/kg  Q3W  arm.  He received  8  doses  of pembrolizumab  (last  dose  on  Day  148)  and  had  a  best  response  of  stable  disease  based  on independent central review of imaging. Treatment was discontinued due to progressive disease on Day 175 and eventually the patient died on Day 272 due to progression of advanced melanoma.

## Safety results

The AEs are all Grade 1 in severity, and none were considered to be related to study treatment by the investigator. No action was taken with respect to study medication for any of the AEs recorded for this subject.

It is notable that the subject developed hypothyroidism on day 42 of study treatment, managed with levothyroxine.  Although  this  AE  was  reported  as  unrelated  to  study  treatment  by  the  investigator, hypothyroidism is an identified risk for pembrolizumab.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

This application, submitted in accordance with article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, does not provide  any  additional  and  relevant  information  on  the  use  of  pembrolizumab  in  the  paediatric population. According to the agreed PIP for Keytruda (EMEA- 001474-PIP01-13), study  KEYNOTE- 051 ( A  Phase  I/II  study  of  Pembrolizumab  in  children  with  advanced  melanoma  or  a  PD-L1  positive advanced, relapsed or refractory solid tumor or lymphoma ) is at present ongoing and it is expected to be completed by January 2019.

Indeed,  the  submitted  study  P002,  a  phase  2  trial  comparing  pembrolizumab  and  chemotherapy  in advanced IPI-refractory melanoma patients, was not designed to evaluate the pembrolizumab efficacy and safety in the paediatric population, and the only subject enrolled was  considered as a protocol deviation. Due to this single case report, any comparison of available data in the young patient with those  in  the  adult  population  is  of  very  limited  value.  Overall,  a  consistent  pembrolizumab  safety profile, that does not seem to be influenced by the young age of the patient, was registered. However, even  if  considered  by  the  investigator  not-treatment  related,  a  newly  occurred  event  ( Testicular atrophy ), never observed in the adult population, was reported.

Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 Keytruda

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  pembrolizumab  non-clinical  development,  no  studies  were  specifically  conducted  in  juvenile animals.  However,  in  a  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  (SN  08396: One-month  IV  bolus  toxicity  and toxicokinetic study in cynomolgus monkeys with a four-month recovery period ) conducted in juvenile to young adult cynomolgus monkeys , Testicular atrophy was observed in one animal (N. 3003) that was treated with pembrolizumab 200 mg/kg.

More details on the Testicular atrophy event reported in the young patient in study P002 have been submitted by the MAH. Due to the lack of baseline information, regarding the size measurements of the testes and the levels of testosterone, LH, and FSH, the pembrolizumab contribution to the reported testicular  atrophy  cannot  be  characterized.  In  addition,  no  additional  testicular  atrophy  events  are reported  in  the  overall  22  male  children  enrolled  in  study  P051  up  to  27  July  2016  .  Any  further occurrence of Testicular atrophy should be carefully monitored.

The final results from study P002, that were requested as post-marketing measure at the time of the initial MA, will be evaluated within a specific variation for the fulfilment of the Annex II condition by 1Q 2017.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

No meaningful information on the use of pembrolizumab in paediatric patients can be obtained from the single  melanoma patient included as protocol violation in study P002. It is therefore agreed that no change of the SmPC is requested at present

- [x] Fulfilled:

No regulatory action required.

- [ ] Not fulfilled:

## 4. Additional clarification requested

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure:

- The MAH should provide more details on the Testicular Atrophy event, including the narrative, and explain on which basis the investigator classified the event as not related to pembrolizumab.
- The MAH should clarify whether additional Testicular atrophy events have been registered in the ongoing paediatric study P051.

The timetable is a 30 day response timetable without clock stop.

## MAH responses to Request for supplementary information

## Question 1

The  MAH should provide  more  details  on  the  Testicular  Atrophy  event,  including  the  narrative,  and explain on which basis the investigator classified the event as not related to pembrolizumab.

## MAH's response

The subject who entered the trial  had BRAF wild type melanoma of the mucosa with metastases .. He was noted to have Grade 1 testicular atrophy approximately 3 and a half months after having received the first dose, which was considered not related to pembrolizumab.). The patient continued to receive study treatment without interruption.

Since the adverse event was Grade 1 and not related to pembrolizumab, data supporting a narrative was not required to be submitted to the Inform database by the investigator. We have since contacted the investigator for additional information and rationale for assessing the event as not drug-related.

No  prior  size  measurements  of  the  testes  nor  previous  levels  of  testosterone,  LH,  and  FSH  were obtained before entry onto P002, so it is not possible to determine whether the findings of small testes predated the patient's participation in P002.

The MAH agrees with the assessment of the investigator that the adverse event of testicular atrophy was not drug related. There are no prior physical  examination findings or laboratory evaluations to show that the patient had normal testicular size and/or gonadal function at baseline, and to show that the testicular atrophy did not predate the initiation of therapy on pembrolizumab.

## Assessment of MAH's response

The lack of baseline information, regarding the   size  measurements  of  the  testes  and  the  levels  of testosterone,  LH,  and  FSH,  do  not  allow  to  characterize  the  pembrolizumab  contribution  to  the reported testicular atrophy.

## Issue solved

## Question 2

The  MAH  should  clarify  whether  additional  Testicular  atrophy  events  have  been  registered  in  the ongoing paediatric study P051.

## MAH's response

There are currently 43 pediatric patients enrolled in study P051, 22 of those patients are male. The adverse event listings were reviewed on 27-Jul-2016, and there were no reports of testicular atrophy within the clinical database.

## Assessment of MAH's response

At present, no additional testicular atrophy events were reported in study P051.
