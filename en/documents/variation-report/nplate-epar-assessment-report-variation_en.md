## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by platelet destruction caused by antiplatelet autoantibodies. In adults, chronic ITP is more common in women than men (approximately 2:1, respectively) and rarely remits spontaneously. It is classified by duration into newly diagnosed, persistent (3-12 months duration) and chronic (≥ 12 months duration). ITP in adults typically has an insidious onset with no preceding viral or other illness and it normally follows a chronic course.

In Europe, adult ITP has an incidence of 1.6 to 3.9 cases per 100,000 per year with increasing incidence with older age and equal for the sexes except in the mid-adult years (30-60 years), when the disease is more prevalent in women. Childhood ITP has an incidence of between 1.9 and 6.4 per 100,000 per year with equal distribution between the sexes.

The diagnosis of ITP can be difficult because of the variety of presentations and lack of specific criteria. The only consistent abnormalities are microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (with red-cell fragmentation), and thrombocytopenia, features that can also occur in other conditions. Neurologic and renal abnormalities and fever can also occur. The onset of the disease is often insidious because history and physical examination are normal except for symptoms that accompany platelet disorders (purpura, epistaxis, and gingival bleeding are common). In general, ITP is defined by a low platelet count, normal bone marrow, and the absence of other causes of thrombocytopenia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

According to current guidelines the therapeutic goal is to avoid or defer the risks of more toxic treatments (eg splenectomy or immunosuppression), reduce corticosteroid exposure to minimum levels and for the shortest time and achieve long-lasting responses (EMA/CHMP/153191/2013, 2014).

Splenectomy has been utilized to treat immune thrombocytopenia since the early 1900s  and remained the 'first-line, gold standard procedure' until the 1950s, when steroids were introduced . Splenectomy has been the standard second-line treatment for adults with ITP since. It remains the treatment option with the highest overall success rate, with approximately two thirds of patients remaining in clinical remission 5-10 years after splenectomy. A systematic review of 135 case-series published between 1966 and 2004 revealed a complete response rate of 66%, with a median duration of follow-up of 28 months (range, 1-153 months) Kojouri et al, 2004. Also, a &gt; 70% probability of maintaining a response after 5 years was found from follow-up of 402 splenectomized patients (Vianelli, et al, 2005). There are near-term and perioperative complications (general anesthesia, bleeding and thrombosis, as well as postoperative pain, pneumonia and atelectasis, wound/other infection and ileus) and longer-term complications, Risk of Infection, Vascular Complications, Mortality and Relapse.

Even though splenectomy remains an appropriate treatment, the frequency of splenectomy as treatment for ITP in adults seems to be decreasing. Older cohorts described in the literature describe the splenectomy rate at 50 to 60% or higher, and in more recent studies it is around 20 to 25% (Rodeghiero and Ruggeri, 2008). The most recent guidelines of ITP (Provan et al, 2010; Neunert et al, 2011) have both recommended splenectomy as a second-line therapy and agree that splenectomy should be delayed at least 6 to 12 months (Provan et al, 2010; Neunert et al, 2011). However, there is no consensus regarding the best sequence of treatments and therapy should be individualized.

Romiplostim (Nplate) is an Fc-peptide fusion protein (peptibody) that increases platelet production via the thrombopoietin  (TPO)  receptor  (also  known  as  cMpl).  The  peptibody  molecule  is  comprised  of  human immunoglobulin IgG1 Fc domain, with each single chain subunit covalently linked at the C-terminus to a peptide  chain  containing  2  TPO  receptor-binding  domains.  Romiplostim  has  no  amino  acid  sequence homology to endogenous TPO. Romiplostim is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli ( E. coli ).

The indication for which it was approved in the EU is as follows:

'Adult  chronic  immune  (idiopathic)  thrombocytopenic  purpura  (ITP):  splenectomized  patients  who  are refractory to other treatments (e.g., corticosteroids, immunoglobulins).

Nplate may be considered as second line treatment for adult nonsplenectomized patients where surgery is contra-indicated. '

Following the review of the cumulative evidence presented below, Amgen proposes to revise the currently approved EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) indication to remove the phrase 'where surgery is contra-indicated'.

Romiplostim was approved in the European Union (EU) via Centralized Procedure on 04 February 2009. The original marketing authorization application (MAA), submitted in 2008, was based upon 2 pivotal, phase 3 studies of adult subjects with ITP (Studies 20030212 and 20030105) and included supportive data from 7 other  clinical  studies  in  subjects  with  ITP  (Studies  20010218,  20000137A,  20000137B,  20050162, 20040209 [ongoing at time of application], 20030213 [ongoing at time of application], and 20050123); a total of 204 subjects with ITP received romiplostim at the time of the MAA submission.

Cumulative evidence is now available from 13 completed clinical studies (including 5 additional studies in adult subjects with ITP [Studies 20060113, 20060131, 20060216, 20080009, and 20080435); data from a total of 1046 subjects [391 splenectomized and 655 nonsplenectomized]) in support of the proposed the use of  romiplostim  as  an  effective  treatment  in  increasing  and  maintaining  platelet  counts  within  a therapeutically relevant range in the ITP patient population.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The applicant justifies the ERA omission in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr  1*,  1  June  2006). Romiplostim meets the criteria for compounds that may be exempted from testing because of their chemical structure  and  constituents  (amino  acids  and  proteins)  which  should  degrade  into  their  amino  acid  or constitutive elements in the environment. The conclusion of the applicant on environmental risk assessment is accepted. This medicinal product is unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment.

Considering the above data, romiplostim is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant

- Tabular overview of clinical studies

In Figure 1 a schematic view is provided of the studies used as the basis of this application. The MAH uses an efficacy set and a safety analysis pool which consist of overlapping studies. Most of the studies have been previously used as part of procedures regarding the MAA of Nplate, type 2 variations, or other procedures regarding romiplostim. Study 20089435, 20060113 and 20060216 have not been previously assessed and are thus included in this assessment in light of the indication extension requested. The safety analysis set consisted of a larger pool of studies due to the addition of Study 20000137A, 20000137B, 20010218 and 20050162 which were not used as part of the efficacy analysis set.

## Study 20060216

A Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Phase 3 Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of AMG 531 in Thrombocytopenic Japanese Subjects with Immune (Idiopathic) Thrombocytopenic Purpura

## Methods

Study 20060216 was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of romiplostim in thrombocytopenic Japanese subjects with ITP. This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of romiplostim in thrombocytopenic Japanese subjects with ITP. The design was similar to that of the 2 pivotal clinical studies that were the basis of the 2007 global marketing applications for romiplostim in adult ITP. Approximately 30 subjects were planned to be enrolled in a 2:1 ratio to romiplostim or placebo (20 subjects for romiplostim and 10 subjects for placebo). Randomization was stratified by splenectomy status (yes or no). Investigational product was administered by SC injection once  per  week  starting  at  a  dose  of  3μg/kg.  Dose  adjustment  was  allowed  throughout  the  12-week treatment period to allow subjects to maintain platelet counts in the target range of 50 to 200 x 10 9 /L. The maximum permitted dose was 10 μg/kg.

After 12 weeks of treatment, a global extension study (Study 20030213) to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of romiplostim is ongoing for subjects who completed another romiplostim ITP study. In Study 20030213,  dose  adjustment  is  allowed  throughout  the  treatment  period  to  allow  subjects  to  maintain platelet counts in the targeted therapeutic range. Dose adjustment in the individual subject has resulted in favorable maintenance of the appropriate platelet response.

Eleven sites in Japan participated in this study and each enrolled at least 1 subject.

If theplateletcountsincreased to&gt;400x10°/Lwiththeuseofrescuemedication,thedosewas toremainthesameasthepreviousdoseonthenextscheduleddosedaywhentheplateletcount was≤200x10/L

If the current dose was 1 μg/kg and a dose reduction was required, dose administration was to be held until the platelet count fell to &lt; 50 x 109/L. Once the platelet count was &lt; 50 x 109/L, dosing was to resume at a dose of 1 μg/kg using the dose adjustment rules above.

The starting dose of 3 μg/kg was determined based on:

The results of the phase 2 study in Japanese subjects with ITP (Study 20050162). From Study 20050162, the doses tested (1, 3, and 6 μg/kg) were well tolerated and demonstrated dose-dependent effects of increasing platelet counts, and the 6-μg/kg dose was determined to be inappropriate as a starting dose because an excessive increase in platelet counts was observed in 1 subject. The start-up portion of the dose adjustment rules (from initiation of dosing until platelet count is &gt; 50 x 109/L) used in the global phase 3 studies was not used in this study, because the starting dose was 3 μg/kg and thus it was expected that platelet counts &gt; 50 x 109/L could be achieved earlier than in the global phase 3 studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Prior and Concomitant Therapy

Treatment  of  ITP  with  allowed  concurrent  oral  corticosteroids,  azathioprine,  and/or  danazol  was  to  be continued  at  a  constant  dose  and  schedule  throughout  the  study,  except  for  dose  reduction  or discontinuation in subjects who experienced intolerable adverse events judged to be related to these drugs.

Throughout the study, rescue medication was permitted for severe bleeding tendency, or if the investigator believed  that  the  subject  was  at  immediate  risk  of  bleeding.  Rescue  medication  was  defined  as  any medication  administered  for  the  intended  purpose  of  raising  platelet  counts.  Recommended  rescue medications were IV Ig, platelet transfusions, corticosteroids, and an increase in dose or frequency of a concurrent oral corticosteroid, azathioprine, and/or danazol in subjects administered an allowed constant dose. Subjects who required administration of rescue medications during the treatment period were to continue receiving investigational product. Splenectomy therapy was not permitted

## Objectives

Primary Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of romiplostim compared with placebo in thrombocytopenic Japanese subjects with ITP as measured by number of weeks with weekly platelet responses

Secondary Objective: To evaluate the safety of romiplostim

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was the number of weeks with weekly platelet response (a platelet count of ≥ 50 x 10 9 /L on a weekly scheduled dose day from week 2 to week 13 excluding platelet counts within 4 weeks following the use of rescue medication). For the primary endpoint, a Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 to compare romiplostim with placebo. In addition, a summary of platelet counts at each timepoint from baseline to week 13 was to be provided by means of numerical summaries and a graph.

## Other variables

-Increase in Platelet Count ≥ 20 x 109/L from Baseline

-The proportions of subjects with an increase in platelet count ≥ 20 x 109/L from baseline without the use of rescue medication within 4 weeks before the measurement was to be tested using Fisher's exact test.

-Change from Baseline in Mean of Last 4-week Platelet Counts

The change from baseline in mean of the last 4-week platelet counts of the 2 groups was to be tested with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using baseline platelet count as a covariate. The baseline platelet count was the mean of 3 screening and one predose platelet counts. Platelet counts within 4 weeks following the use of rescue medication were to be excluded.

-Rescue Medication

-Weekly Platelet Response Defined as ≥ 50 to ≤ 200 (x 109/L)

In this analysis, a weekly platelet response was defined as a platelet count of ≥ 50 x 109/L to ≤ 200 x 109/L on a weekly scheduled dose day from week 2 to week 13.

The 2 groups were to be tested using Wilcoxon rank sum. Platelet counts within 4 weeks following the use of rescue medication were to be excluded (considered as no response).

## Other Efficacy Analyses

The following additional analyses were planned in the protocol and/or the Statistical Analysis Plan:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Summary statistics exploring the influence of splenectomy status for the primary and the secondary endpoints through subgroup analysis
- Summary statistics exploring the influence of concurrent ITP medication for the primary and the secondary endpoints through subgroup analysis
- Line-connected weekly platelet counts plots with administered doses from baseline to end of study for each individual subject
- Line-connected proportion plots of weekly platelet responses from week 2 to week 13
- Time to first platelet response using Kaplan-Meier estimate and Kaplan-Meier estimates of median, Q1, and Q3

· Summaries of platelet responses defined as a platelet count of ≥ 50 x 109/L and doubling from baseline, ≥ 100 x 109/L, ≥ 200 x 109/L, and ≥ 400 x 109/L

## Safety Endpoints

Among others the incidence of adverse events was summarized by system organ class and by preferred term according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory activities (MedDRA) (version 12.0) dictionary for each treatment group.

## Sample size

The primary endpoint was the number of weeks with weekly platelet responses from week 2 to week 13. The primary endpoint was compared using a Wilcoxon rank sum test at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. In this study, the sample size was estimated to provide at least 90% power under the above conditions.

To evaluate an appropriate sample size and power for this study, basic statistics regarding the number of weeks  with  weekly  platelet  responses  were  obtained  from  overseas  phase  3  Studies  20030105  and 20030212 using SAS® sample size combination of 16 in the romiplostim group and 8 in the placebo group should provide at least 90% power. To be conservative, the sample sizes for the present study were chosen to be 20 for the romiplostim group and 10 for the placebo group.

Because  the  use  of  rescue  medications  may  increase  efficacy,  in  this  consideration,  2  statistics  were obtained: i) all platelet counts regardless of rescue medication use, and ii) platelet counts within 4 weeks after rescue medication administration was removed.

To be conservative, weekly platelet responses i) for the placebo group and ii) for the romiplostim group were used. Because of the limitation of nQuery® to carry the number of categories in the Wilcoxon rank sum test, the higher categories were collapsed

## Randomisation

Participants were randomised in 2:1 ratio (romiplostim vs placebo)

## Blinding (masking)

Romiplostim  and  placebo  were  labeled  and  prepared  in  the  same  manner.  Doses  of  placebo  were volume-matched to romiplostim doses. Per local requirements, the study was unblinded for analysis of romiplostim serum concentrations and for antibody testing. No study personnel were unblinded during the conduct of the study. Antibody results were sent to the study centers after unblinding.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical methods

The study hypothesis was that romiplostim would effectively raise platelet counts to ≥ 50 x 109/L, compared with placebo, over the treatment period. With respect to the primary endpoint (eg, number of weeks with weekly platelet responses), the null hypothesis was that the mean number of weeks with weekly platelet responses was the same in both groups, and the alternative hypothesis was that they were different.

## Results

## Participant flow

All randomised subjects received their assigned treatment and completed the study.

## Recruitment

A total of 34 subjects were randomized to the study, 22 subjects to romiplostim and 12 subjects to placebo. Each center enrolled a total of 1 to 8 subjects.

## Conduct of the study

The original protocol, dated 25 July 2007, had 2 superseding versions, 01 April 2008 and 01 September 2008.

The  01  September  2008  superseding  version  reflects  administrative  changes  due  to  changes  in  study organization and contact information and changes in the entire study period due to the extension of the enrollment period.

Minor revisions were made to the Statistical Analysis Plan on 19 May 2009 to clarify the definitions of completion of treatment and completion of study and to update the definitions of concurrent ITP therapy and treatment period to be consistent with the study protocol.

## Baseline data

The mean age of subjects in the romiplostim group (58.5 years) was higher than that in the placebo group (47.6 years) and more subjects in the romiplostim group were 65 years or older compared to subjects in the placebo group (32% versus 8%).

Seventy-one percent of the subjects were female (64% for the romiplostim group and 83% for the placebo group) and 44% of the subjects (46% for the romiplostim group and 42% for the placebo group) had undergone splenectomy before entering the study.

Sixty-eight percent of subjects were receiving baseline concurrent ITP therapy (more [83%] in the placebo group than in the romiplostim group [59%]).

Platelet counts at baseline were comparable between the romiplostim (mean 18.4 [SD 8.3] x 109/L) and placebo (mean 15.8 [SD 8.6] x 109/L) groups.

Percentages were based on the full analysis set.

## Numbers analysed

No subjects withdrew prematurely from the study.

Important protocol deviations, all related to investigational product administration not being administered at 1 or more visits and missing hematology data at the same visits, occurred in 2 subjects who received placebo and 2 who received romiplostim.

The full analysis set and the safety analysis set consisted of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose  of  investigational  product.  For  the  full  analysis  set,  subjects  were  analyzed  according  to  their randomized treatment group, and for the safety analysis set, subjects were analyzed according to the treatment actually received.

## Outcomes and estimation

Romiplostim was statistically significantly superior to placebo for the primary efficacy endpoint, number of weeks with weekly platelet response (platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L) and for all secondary efficacy endpoints except for rescue medication use.

- Platelet counts within 4 weeks after receiving any rescue medications were considered as no platelet response.

* Weekly platelet response was defined as weekly platelet count2 50 x 10°L between week 2 and week 13 inclusive. Weeks with missing platelet count were considered no weekly response.

## Weekly Platelet Counts

An increase in platelet counts was apparent in the romiplostim group by week 2: mean (SD) of 152.8 (102.0) x  10 9 /L  for  romiplostim  compared  with  16.8  (9.3)x10 9 /L  for  placebo.  The  mean  platelet  count  in  the romiplostim group increased to a maximum of 303.9 x 109/L at week 3 and remained at an increased mean level ranging from approximately 96 x 10 9 /L to 272 x 10 9 /L for the remainder of the 13-week treatment period, while levels in the placebo group did not change appreciably during the study.

The full analysis set (FAS) consisted of all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of investigational product. Subjects were analyzed according to their randomized treatment group.

= number of subiects with weekly platelet between 50 and 200 (x107/L).

Platelet counts within 4 weeks after receiving any rescue medications were considered as not between 50 and 200 (x109/L).

N = number of subjects with non-missing weekly platelet count.

## Time to Platelet Response

Twenty-one of 22 subjects in the romiplostim group had a platelet response, and the median (Q1, Q3) time to first weekly platelet response for subjects in the romiplostim group was 1.0 week (1.0, 1.3). The median time to platelet response was 1 week regardless of splenectomy status or baseline concurrent ITP therapy.

Thirteen of 14 romiplostim subjects who achieved a platelet response at week 13 had a subsequent platelet count ≤ 50 x 10 9 /L or received rescue medication. The median (Q1, Q3) time from week 13 to the first platelet count of 50 x 109/L or less or receiving rescue medication was 1.0 weeks (1.0, 2.0)

## Other Platelet Responses

Greater numbers of subjects in the romiplostim group than in the placebo group achieved platelet responses during week 2 to 13 as determined by 4 additional definitions of platelet response. The number of subjects with highest platelet count of ≥ 50 x 109/L and doubling from baseline was 21 of 22 (95.5%) in the romiplostim group and 1 of 12 (8.3%) in the placebo group. The numbers of romiplostim subjects who had a highest platelet count of ≥ 100 x 109/L, ≥ 200 x 109/L, and ≥ 400 x 109/L were 19 of 22 (86.4%), 16 of 22 (72.7%), and 7 of 22 (31.8%), respectively, while no placebo subjects achieved these platelet responses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

More subjects in  romiplostim  group  than  in  the  placebo  group  achieved  these  responses  regardless  of splenectomy status or baseline concurrent ITP therapy

## -Subject Incidence of Bleeding Symptoms

The  incidence  of  bleeding  symptoms  (subjects  who  had  purpura/petechiae,  epistaxis,  oral  bleeding, menorrhagia, bruising, intra-cranial bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, other bleeding symptoms, or any of these symptoms) was analyzed for the safety analysis set. The incidence of any of these bleeding symptoms in the placebo group was 83.3% of subjects at baseline (week 1 predose) and week 5, 100% of subjects at week 9, and 83.3% of subjects at week 13 (end of treatment).

Romiplostim decreased the incidence of bleeding symptoms from 63.6% of subjects at baseline to 31.8% of subjects at weeks 5 and 9 and to 36.4% of subjects at week 13 (end of treatment). In the all postdose period, 100% of placebo subjects and 72.7% of romiplostim subjects had bleeding symptoms.

## Pharmacokinetics

In total, 8 serum samples for romiplostim pharmacokinetics analysis were collected from 4 subjects. All 4 subjects who had serum samples collected for romiplostim serum concentration analysis were treated with placebo. All subjects had romiplostim concentrations below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ = 15 pg/mL) except for one subject, who had measurable romiplostim concentrations of 28.5 pg/mL and 27.5 pg/mL on weeks 8 and 9, respectively. Platelet counts on the dates these measurements were obtained were not  increased  despite  these  observed  concentrations,  suggesting  that  there  were  no  errors  in  dose administration.

## Ancillary analyses

## N/A

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Updated  efficacy  results  from  an  analysis  of  pooled  data  from  9  clinical  studies  (Studies  20030105, 20030212,  20030213,  20040209,  20060113,  20060131,  20060216,  20080009,  and  20080435)  are presented in this submission. A total of 1024 subjects (376 subjects had prior splenectomy and 648 had no prior splenectomy) were included in the adult ITP efficacy set. The analyses were based on the treatment the subject actually received and were restricted to romiplostim-treated subjects only; subjects were treated for up to 283 weeks.

## Statistical Methodology for Efficacy Analyses of Pooled Data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A subgroup analysis by prior splenectomy status (at the time of enrollment) was conducted on all efficacy endpoints. For subjects who enrolled in an extension study, the splenectomy status at the time of enrollment in the parent study was carried forward.

Platelet counts and platelet response were summarized based on the adult ITP efficacy set, restricted to romiplostim-treated adult subjects only. The earlier phase (phase 1 or 2) dose-finding studies were excluded from this analysis because subjects from those studies were on different and fixed-dose schedules and typically had short study durations. The romiplostim treatment period excluded the washout period that some subjects had between the parent study and the extension study. Platelet counts measured within 4 weeks after use of rescue medication were excluded from all analyses. Median monthly platelet count was summarized. Subjects with missing platelet  counts  had  their  values  imputed  with  the  last  observation carried forward up to the point of study completion/withdrawal. Incidence of platelet response, sustained platelet response, and incidence of platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L and ≤ 200 x 109/L were summarized using subject incidence and 95% exact confidence intervals (CIs) for the rates by romiplostim treatment period.

Number  of  months  with  platelet  response  and  platelet  count  ≥  50  x  109/L  and  ≤  200  x  109/L  were summarized by treatment period using the mean, standard deviation (SD), 25th percentile (Q1), 75th percentile (Q3), minimum, and maximum. The percent of months with platelet response and platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L and ≤ 200 x 109/L, using the total number of the months with an evaluable platelet count as the  denominator,  was  summarized  by  treatment  period  using  the  mean,  SD,  Q1,  Q3,  minimum,  and maximum.  Time  in  weeks  from  the  first  administration  of  romiplostim  to  first  platelet  response  was summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method. Subjects who did not achieve a response were censored at the time of the last platelet count measurement. Among subjects who had a platelet response, the number of months and the percent of weeks with platelet  response  during  the  time  period  between  first  platelet response  and  end  of  the  study  were  summarized  using  mean,  SD,  median,  Q1,  Q3,  minimum,  and maximum.

The maximum number of consecutive weeks that a subject had a platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L without use of concomitant ITP medications or romiplostim in the same week was summarized using mean, SD, median, Q1, Q3, minimum, and maximum, by romiplostim treatment period.

## Results

## Demographics and Baseline Characteristics

A total of 1024 subjects (376 subjects with prior splenectomy and 648 with no prior splenectomy) were included in the adult ITP efficacy set. In the adult ITP efficacy set, 60.2% of the subjects with no prior splenectomy were women, 76.2% were white, the median age was 53.0 years (range 18 to 93 years), and the median (Q1, Q3) time since ITP diagnosis was 1.63 (0.33, 5.41) years . The median baseline platelet count was 19.4 x 109/L.

Among subjects with prior splenectomy, 64.1% were women, 85.4% were white, the median age was 52.0 years (range 18 to 88 years), the median (Q1, Q3) time since ITP diagnosis was 9.03 (3.40, 18.14) years, and the median time since splenectomy was 6.39 years. The median baseline platelet count was 15.0 x 109/L . Thus, in general, the subjects with prior splenectomy represented a more advanced ITP population.

## Subject Incidence of Platelet Response

- Subject Incidence of Platelet Counts Between 50 x 109/L and 200 x 109/L During the romiplostim treatment period, most subjects (77.7% of subjects with prior splenectomy and 88.7% of subjects with no prior splenectomy) had at least 1 platelet count during treatment between 50 x 109/L and 200 x 109/L without any use of rescue medication within 4 weeks prior to the date of the platelet

measurement (Table 3-6).

Footnote of table:The adult ITP efficacy set consists of adult subjects (age ≥18 years at screening) who received at least 1 romiplostim dose in 1 of studies 20030105, 20030212, 20030213, 20040209, 20060113, 20060131, 20060216, 20080009, and 20080435.

## ITP = immune thrombocytopenic purpura

All platelet counts recorded within 4 weeks after use of rescue medication are excluded from this analysis. Romiplostim treatment period is counted starting from first dose date of romiplostim, excluding washout period that subjects may have between parent study and extension study. Platelet counts measured on the same day of first dose date were excluded from the analysis. Source: Modified from Table 14-4.1.4.2.1

- Number of Months With Platelet Response

## Number of Months With Platelet Count Between 50 x 109/L and 200 x 109/L

The median (Q1, Q3) number of months with platelet count between 50 x 10 9 /L and 200 x 10 9 /L was 6.0 (1.0, 17.5) in subjects with prior splenectomy and 10.0 (3.0, 19.5) in subjects with no prior splenectomy (Table 3-7). The median (Q1, Q3) percent time (months) with platelet count between 50 x 109/L and 200 x 109/L  was  50.0%  (11.3%,  77.9%)  in  subjects  with  prior  splenectomy  and  69.0%  (40.0%,  88.6%)  in subjects with no prior splenectomy.

- Sustained Platelet Response

Sustained platelet response was defined as having at least 9 weeks with platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L in any 9- to12-week interval with no use of rescue medication during the 4 weeks prior to each qualifying platelet count. Among subjects with prior splenectomy, 67.6% (95% CI: 62.6%, 72.3%) had a sustained platelet response (Table 3-5). Among subjects with no prior splenectomy, 79.9% (95% CI: 76.6%, 83.0%) had a sustained platelet response.

## · Loss of Platelet Response

Loss of platelet response was defined as having a sustained platelet response followed by platelet counts &lt; 50 x 109/L and romiplostim dose ≥ 10 g/kg for at least 9 weeks during any 9 - to 12-week period or at least 3 weeks during the last 3 to 4 weeks of the study for subjects who withdrew early. Of the subjects with sustained platelet response, 7.9% (95% CI: 4.9, 11.9) with prior splenectomy and 6.9% (95% CI: 4.9, 9.5) with no prior splenectomy lost platelet response (Table 3-9).

## · Remission

A secondary endpoint of Study 20080435 was subject incidence of ITP remission during the 12-month treatment or tapering period of the study. An ITP remission was defined as maintaining every platelet count ≥ 50 x109/L for at least 6 months in the absence of romiplostim and any medication for ITP (concomitant or rescue) through discontinuation. The study population consisted of adults with primary ITP diagnosed within the last 6 months who had received only first-line therapy for ITP; surgical resection of the spleen was an exclusion criterion, per the protocol. In the safety analysis set for this study, 31 of 75 (41.3%) subjects entered the ITP remission period and 24 of 75 (32.0%) achieved ITP remission during the study. The median (range) time to onset of ITP remission for these subjects was 27 (6 to 57) weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Results of studies compared to standard of care (SOC) in  non-splenectomised patients

## -Study 20060131

The pooled analysis included top line results from study 20060131, which was conducted in non-splenectomised subjects comparing the ability of romiplostim versus medical standard of care (SOC).

Study S3 (131) was an open-label randomised 52 week trial in subjects who received romiplostim or medical standard of care (SOC) treatment. This study evaluated non-splenectomised patients with ITP and platelet counts &lt; 50 x 10 9 /l.

The aim was to prevent splenectomy and to provide a durable treatment option to these patients for at least a  52-week  period.  The  study  was  designed  to  assess  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  romiplostin self-administration (N = 109 self-administering adults).

The  first  primary  endpoint  was  the  number  of  subjects  undergoing  splenectomy  during  the  52-week treatment period by randomized treatment group. The second primary endpoint was the number of subjects with a treatment failure during the 52-week treatment period by randomized treatment group.

Subjects were enrolled in a 2:1 randomization.

## Results

In total there were 234 subjects, 157 randomized to receive romiplostim and 77 randomized to receive SOC; out of these there were N = 109 self administering adults.

Romiplostim was administered to 157 subjects by subcutaneous (SC) injection once weekly starting at a dose of 3 µg/kg, and adjusted throughout the study within a range of 1-10 µg/kg in order to maintain platelet counts between 50 and 200 x 10 9 /l, 77 subjects received SOC treatment according to standard institutional practice or therapeutic guidelines.

The overall subject incidence rate of splenectomy was 8.9% (14 of 157 subjects) in the romiplostim group compared with 36.4% (28 of 77 subjects) in the SOC group, with an odds ratio (romiplostim vs SOC) of 0.17 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.35). The p-value for the treatment difference between groups was &lt; 0.0001.

The overall subject incidence of treatment failure was 11.5% (18 of 157 subjects) in the romiplostim group compared with 29.9% (23 of 77 subjects) in the SOC group, with an odds ratio (romiplostim vs SOC) of 0.31 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.61). The p-value for the treatment difference between groups was 0.0005.

Of the 157 subjects randomised to the romiplostim group, three subjects did not receive romiplostim. Among the 154 subjects who received romiplostim, the total median exposure to romiplostim was 52.0 weeks and ranged from 2 to 53 weeks. The most frequently used weekly dose was between 3-5 µg/kg (25th-75th percentile respectively; median 3 µg/kg).

Of the 77 subjects randomised to the SOC group, two subjects did not receive any SOC. Among the 75 subjects who received at least one dose of SOC, the total median exposure to SOC was 51 weeks and ranged from 0.4 to 52 weeks.

Platelet responses were also consistently achieved by a higher proportion of subjects in the romiplostim group compared with those in the SOC group starting from week 2. Poisson regression analyses indicated that romiplostim subjects were 2.3 times more likely to have a platelet response than subjects in the SOC group (p &lt; 0.0001).

## Study 20060113

An Open Label Extension Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Long-Term Dosing of AMG 531 in Thrombocytopenic Japanese Subjects with Immune (Idiopathic) Thrombocytopenic Purpura

Study 20060113 was designed to provide safety and efficacy data on the long-term use of romiplostim in thrombocytopenic Japanese subjects with ITP.

Based on the results of the phase 2 study in Japanese subjects with ITP (Study 20050162), the default starting dose in Study 20060113 was determined to be 3 μg/kg. For subjects who during their previous study had shown a platelet count increase of ≥ 20 x 109/L over baseline at least once during the 13-week treatment period (except platelet responses that occurred within 4 weeks after rescue therapy), and who were enrolled in Study 20060113 within 12 weeks of receiving their last dose of investigational product in the previous study, the starting dose in Study 20060113 was to be the same as the last dose received in the previous study.

Individual dose adjustments based on platelet counts were permitted. The dose adjustment rules in this study were amended to be consistent with those in the Japan phase 3 study (Study 20060216), and similar to those used in the overseas phase 3 studies (Studies 20030212 and 20030105).

## Primary Objectives

The  primary  objective  was  to  determine  the  safety  of  romiplostim  as  a  long-term  treatment  in thrombocytopenic Japanese subjects with ITP.

## Secondary Objectives

- to evaluate the long-term platelet response to romiplostim
- to evaluate possible reductions in the dose of concurrent ITP therapies while receiving romiplostim
- to evaluate changes in Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) because of the use of romiplostim

## Inclusion Criteria

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To be eligible for entry into the study, subjects were required to fulfill all of the following inclusion criteria during screening:

- Subjects must have previously completed a romiplostim ITP study in Japan.
- Platelet count taken at the screening visit must have been &lt; 50 x 109/L.
- Before any study-specific procedure, the appropriate written informed consent must have been obtained.

## Exclusion Criteria

· any significant change in medical history since completion of the previous romiplostim ITP study, including bone marrow stem cell disorders or new active malignancies

· known positive result from a test for neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim in the previous romiplostim ITP study

· received any treatment for ITP except oral corticosteroids, azathioprine, and/or danazol administered at a constant dose and schedule from at least 4 weeks prior to the screening visit

-  received  intravenous  immunoglobulin  (IV  Ig),  anti-D  immunoglobulin  (anti-D  Ig),  or  any  drug administered to increase platelet counts within 1 week before the screening visit
-  received  anti-malignancy  agents  (eg,  cyclophosphamide,  6-mercaptopurine,  vincristine,  vinblastine, interferon alfa, etc) within 4 weeks before the screening visit
- received any monoclonal antibody drugs (eg, rituximab etc) within 8 weeks before the screening visit
- less than 4 weeks since receipt of any therapeutic drug or device that is not MHLW-approved for any indication before the screening visit (excluding romiplostim)

## Treatments Administered

Subjects with a platelet count ≤ 20 x 109/L after receiving a dose of 10 μg/kg were required to return to the investigational site the following week to obtain a platelet count and for in-clinic dosing. Weekly platelet counts and in-clinic doses were to continue until the subject's platelet count had been &gt; 20 x 109/L for 2 consecutive weeks.

## Study Endpoints

The primary endpoint was the incidence of all adverse events, including clinically significant changes in laboratory values.

The secondary endpoints were:

- -incidence of anti-romiplostim antibody formation
- -incidence of platelet response (platelet response is defined as a doubling of baseline platelet count and ≥ 50 x 109/L; baseline platelet count is that at study entry in the previous study).
- -To discount the possible platelet effect associated with rescue medications, subjects were considered to have had no platelet response for 8 weeks after any administration of rescue medication, and those platelet counts were excluded from the efficacy analysis.
- -proportion of subjects able to reduce from baseline or discontinue their concurrent ITP therapies (for subjects that are receiving oral corticosteroids, azathioprine, and/or danazol at a constant dose and schedule at the screening visit)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -change from baseline in PRO endpoints at each time point (baseline PRO is obtained at day 1 predose)

The exploratory endpoints were PK parameters such as area under the concentration time curve (AUC) and maximum observed concentration (Cmax).

Subject subsets that may have been addressed in the analysis were defined by the following: splenectomy status (yes, no); concurrent ITP therapy (yes, no); previous study (20050162, 20060216)

## Results

## -Enrollment and Disposition of Subjects

A total of 44 subjects were enrolled in the study, of whom 42 (95.5%) completed the study. All subjects enrolled received romiplostim and 35 (79.5%) completed romiplostim treatment  Forty subjects completed 84 weeks, 23 subjects completed 144 weeks, 9 subjects completed 216 weeks, and 7 subjects completed at least 228 weeks on study

## -Investigational Product Discontinuations

All subjects received at least 1 dose of romiplostim. Thirty-five subjects (79.5%) completed romiplostim treatment, while the remainder discontinued treatment because of subject request (6 subjects [13.6%]), administrative decision (2 subjects [4.5%]), or other (1 subject [2.3%] whose platelet count was &gt; 200 x 109/L even after romiplostim was withheld for 3 weeks [Subject 113216083]).

-Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics

Of the 44 subjects enrolled, 11 (25%) had completed Study 20050162, and 33 (75%) had completed Study 20060216. All subjects were of Japanese ethnicity; 31 subjects (70.5%) were women and 13 (29.5%) were men. Subjects' ages ranged from 25 to 81 years, with an average (SD) age of 54.9 (12.9) years. Eight subjects (18.2%) were ≥ age 65 years, and 3 subjects (6.8%) were ≥ age 75 years. All of the subjects age 65  years  or  older  were  previously  enrolled  in  Study  20060216,  but  with  that  exception,  the  subject demographics from the 2 parent studies were similar.

Mean (SD) baseline weight (based on the pretreatment measurement closest to the study's first dose) was 58.5 (11.4) kg. Subjects had received a variety of other therapies for their ITP before this study, including corticosteroids  (43  subjects  [97.7%]),  IV  Ig  (25  subjects  [56.8%]); H  pylori eradication  (21  subjects [47.7%]), splenectomy (17 subjects [38.6%]), azathioprine (11 subjects [25.0%]), danazol (10 subjects [22.7%]), cyclophosphamide (5 subjects [11.4%]), vincristine/vinblastine (3 subjects [6.8%]), rituximab (3 subjects [6.8%]) and other therapies (25 subjects [56.8%]). In the interval between completing the previous romiplostim study and beginning this study, 29 subjects (65.9%) had received corticosteroids and 2 subjects (4.5%) had received azathioprine for their ITP

## Reduction of Concurrent ITP Therapy

Of the 25 subjects (56.8% of the safety analysis set) who were receiving concurrent ITP therapy at baseline 11 (44.0%) had a &gt; 25% reduction in at least 1 concurrent therapy, 6 (24.0%) had a &gt; 50% reduction in at least 1 concurrent therapy, and 9 (36.0%) discontinued all concurrent therapies.

The incidence of &gt; 25% reduction, &gt; 50% reduction, and discontinuation of concurrent ITP therapy was 55.6%, 33.3%, and 22.2% in splenectomized subjects, respectively, and 37.5%, 18.8%, and 43.8% in nonsplenectomized subjects, respectively

## -Bleeding Symptoms

During week 1, prior to treatment with romiplostim, 84.1% of subjects reported bleeding symptoms; the most common were purpura/petechiae (81.8%), epistaxis (25.0%), and oral bleeding (22.7%) Bleeding symptoms were reduced during every 4-week period after treatment with romiplostim (after week 1), excluding week 240 in which the single subject still on study reported a bleeding symptom; the maximum and minimum proportion of subjects that reported bleeding symptoms during any 4-week period was 36.6% (as observed at week 40) and 0 (as observed at weeks 164 and weeks 228 through 236), respectively. The incidence of bleeding symptoms at the end of study (3 weeks after the last dose of romiplostim) was

21.4%. The incidence of bleeding symptoms was similar during most 4-week periods in splenectomized subjects and nonsplenectomized subjects.

The incidence of bleeding symptoms was higher during most 4-week periods in subjects who were receiving concurrent ITP therapy at baseline than in those who were not

## Rescue Medication Use

Nine subjects (20.5% of the safety analysis set) received rescue medications at some point during the study. The  most  commonly  used  rescue  mediations  were  prednisolone  (7  subjects  [15.9%]),  concentrated platelets (4 subjects [9.1%]), platelets (2 subjects [4.5%]), and human normal immunoglobulin (2 subjects [4.5%])

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  percentage  of  subjects  using  rescue  medications  was  higher  among  splenectomized  subjects  than nonsplenectomized subjects (6 subjects [35.3%] and 3 subjects [11.1%], respectively)

## Pharmacokinetics Results

In total, 58 serum samples for romiplostim concentration measurement were collected from 15 subjects, of which 5 subjects had serial serum samples collected for PK parameter estimation.

After SC administration, the peak concentrations of romiplostim ranged from 39.5 to 501 pg/mL and were observed at 12 to 24 hours post-dose (See 10-1)

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The efficacy of romiplostim in non-splenectomised patients (second line treatment) was based on the results of  the  two  pivotal  double  blind  and  placebo  controlled  studies.  Study  20030212,  conducted  in non-splenectomised  subjects,  demonstrated  the  superiority  of  romiplostin  over  placebo  in  the  rate  of durable platelet responses (61% vs 4.8% in romiplostin and placebo, respectively), and Study 20030105 did so in patients refractory to splenectomy (38.1% of responders in romiplostim group and 0% in placebo). Interim  results  from  the  long  term  extension  Study  20030213,  showed  sustained  platelet  responses. However, due to the limited safety database at the time of the initial MAA (62 non-splenectomised and 63 splenectomized subjects), the uncertainties around safety and efficacy of romiplostin in the long term and given the well-established place in therapeutics of splenectomy, with positive results lifelong, the CHMP expressed concerns on the treatment of non-splenectomised patients, which led to a restricted wording of the indication to third line treatment, following splenectomy or, as a second line treatment option only in those cases where splenectomy is not an immediate reasonable option.

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

To support broadening of the current indication, a pooled analysis of a total of 9 clinical trials conducted up to date has been provided. This included a total of 1024 subjects (376 subjects with prior splenectomy and 648 with no prior splenectomy).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The data submitted by the MAH provides pooled safety and efficacy data for up to 284 weeks.  The pooled analysis provides long term efficacy in chronic ITP patients with and without prior splenectomy, this consists of a heterogeneous population with associated limitations. A comparison of efficacy for romiplostim with other  treatments  for  chronic  ITP,  including  splenectomy,  has  not  been  possible.    Further  information submitted by the Applicant provides detailed data from study 131 supporting reasonably the efficacy of romiplostim  in  comparison  to  standard  of  care  in  non-splenectomised  patients.  The  weaknesses  of comparing pharmaceutical interventions, such as romiplostim with surgical treatment (splenectomy) are acknowledged to some extent.

The pooled studies consisted of a different subgroups of subjects: patients refractory to splenectomy (study 20030105), a heterogeneous group of subjects with ITP (studies 20030213, 20040209, 20060113, 20060216, 200800009, 20080435), non-splenectomised subjects prior to splenectomy (study 20030212), and non-splenectomised subjects (study 20060131). Non-splenectomised patients consist of several subgroups, such as patients eligible for splenectomy awaiting or delaying surgery, patients using romiplostim as maintenance therapy replacing a splenectomy, patients not in need of splenectomy, patients with a contra-indication for surgery. Treatment of patients in these various situations may require different approaches.  By pooling within these two groups (non-splenectomised and splenectomized), the MAH assumes that the populations are similar. However within the non-splenectomised patients the group with a contra-indication might differ substantially from patients awaiting splenectomy with respect   to disease responsiveness, disease duration and previously received treatment. Moreover, the pooled data differ in follow-up time, baseline characteristics, study-set up, outcome measures etc. There were proportionately more Japanese subjects in the group of non-splenectomised subjects than in the group of splenectomized subjects in the pooled analysis. The additional analysis performed by the MAH has shown that the exclusion of the Japanese subjects did not lead to a different outcome of efficacy and safety between splenectomized and non- splenectomized patients, and therefore regional differences and/or race are not the explanation for the observed difference.

The pool included  results  from  Study  20060131,  which  was  conducted  in  non-splenectomised  subjects comparing the ability of romiplostim versus medical standard of care (SOC) to prevent splenectomy and to provide  a  durable  treatment  option  to  these  patients  for  at  least  a  52-week  period.  The  first  primary endpoint was the number of subjects undergoing splenectomy during the 52-week treatment period by randomized treatment group. The second primary endpoint was the number of subjects with a treatment failure during the 52-week treatment period by randomized treatment group. It should be highlighted that the study was designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of romiplostin self administration.

Patients were classified as chronic ITP patients, however according to the data submitted the 32% of the patients had a disease duration &lt; 6 months. In non-splenectomised subjects, the median number of years since  ITP  diagnosis  was  1.63  years  in  the  overall  non-splectomized  population,  more  than  3  prior  ITP therapies had been received by 11.4% of all non-splenectomised subjects. 14.9% of those with ITP for &gt; 6 months and 15.3% of those with ITP for &gt; 12 months. In splenectomized subjects, the median number of years since ITP diagnosis was 9.03 years in the overall splenectomized population, more than 3 prior ITP therapies had been received by 35.1% of all splenectomized subjects.  36.4% of those with ITP for &gt; 6 months and 36.5% of those with ITP for &gt; 12 months.

In  addition,  two  new  studies  completed  in  the  Japanese  population  were  presented  as  supportive information of the efficacy of romiplostin in non-splenectomised subjects. One small phase III (20060216) double-blind  and  placebo-controlled  study  (a  total  of  34  subjects  were  randomized,  22  subjects  to romiplostim and 12 subjects to placebo) and the open label extension 20060113 Study, where patients were followed in the long-term.  In Study 20060216, subjects were stratified according to splenectomy status at baseline and consisted of a double blind 12-week placebo controlled phase which tested a higher than recommended initial starting dose. Study 20060113 was a single arm study aimed to study the safety of romiplostin in the long term. In Study 20060113 a total of 44 subjects were enrolled of whom 42 (95.5%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

completed the study. All subjects enrolled received romiplostim and 35 (79.5%) completed romiplostim treatment. Forty subjects completed 84 weeks, 23 subjects completed 144 weeks, 9 subjects completed 216 weeks, and 7 subjects completed at least 228 weeks on study. Dose adjustments were allowed throughout the treatment period to allow subjects to maintain platelet counts in the targeted therapeutic range, similar to the studies presented in the initial MAA. These studies included cITP subjects that had received at least one previous ITP treatment and continued being thrombocytopenic, i.e. platelet counts ≤ 30 x 109/L was required for study entry.

All studies analysed the efficacy of romiplostin in terms of increments in platelet counts, while assessment of the maintenance of the effect in the long-term, use of rescue and concomitant medication to maintain the response and the proportion of clinical remissions after stopping romiplostin treatment was also performed.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

From the pooled analysis: the median time since ITP diagnosis was 1.63 years in subjects with no prior splenectomy and 9.03 years in subjects with prior splenectomy, and the median baseline platelet count was 19.4 x 109/L in subjects with no prior splenectomy and 15.0 x 109/L in subjects with prior splenectomy. Thus, in general, the subjects with prior splenectomy represented a more advanced ITP population.  The non-splenectomised  patients  are  represented  by  a  larger  proportion  of  Japanese  patients  than  the splenectomized patients. This difference can mainly be attributed to study 20060113 and 20060216. It is uncertain what the difference in race or perhaps regional treatment aspects has on the comparability of the studied population as a whole. The MAH was requested to elucidate on whether the Japanese patients are expected to respond differently than Caucasians in the studied population. Excluding Studies 20060113 and 20060216, led to the exclusion of 45 patients on a total of 1024 patients. Japanese patients did not have a discernible impact on the demographics and baseline characteristics of the Adult ITP efficacy set in the splenectomized  and  non-splenectomised  groups.    Excluding  the  Japanese  subjects  did  not  have  a remarkable effect on the efficacy and the adverse event profile of Romiplostim. There were proportionately more Japanese subjects in the group of non-splenectomised subjects than in the group of splenectomized subjects in the pooled analysis.

There  was  a  high  percentage  of  responders  with  incidence  of  platelet  count  between  50  x10 9 /L  and 200x10 9 /L  in  the  first  6  months  (276/376;  73.4%  and  554/648;  85.5%  in  splenectomized  and non-splenectomized), while later the percentages decrease over time in parallel to the number of patients accounting  for  the  analysis  (28/41;  (68.3%  and  14/22;  63.6%  respectively).  Independently  of  the splenectomy status,  the  time  necessary  to  reach  a  first  platelet  response  was  two  weeks  with  a  50th percentile similar in both subgroups (2.1 weeks and 2.0 weeks). The median (Q1, Q3) number of months with  platelet  counts  between  50  x  109/L  and  200  x  109/L  was  6.0  (1.0,  17.5)  in  subjects  with  prior splenectomy and 10.0 (3.0, 19.5) in subjects with no prior splenectomy. The median (Q1, Q3) percent time (months) with platelet counts between 50 x 109/L and 200 x 109/L was 50.0% (11.3%, 77.9%) in subjects with prior splenectomy and 69.0% (40.0%, 88.6%) in subjects with no prior splenectomy.

Sustained platelet response was defined as having at least 9 weeks with platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L in any 9- to12-week interval with no use of rescue medication during the 4 weeks prior to each qualifying platelet count. Among subjects with prior splenectomy, 67.6% (95% CI: 62.6%, 72.3%) had a sustained platelet response. Among subjects with no prior splenectomy, 79.9% (95% CI: 76.6%, 83.0%) had a sustained platelet response. Of the subjects with sustained platelet response, 7.9% (95% CI: 4.9, 11.9) with prior splenectomy and 6.9% (95% CI: 4.9, 9.5) with no prior splenectomy lost platelet response.

During treatment with romiplostim the median values of the total number of months with platelet counts between 50 x 109/L and 200 x 109/L was 6.0 months [subjects with prior splenectomy] and 10.0 months [subjects with no prior splenectomy]). The number of consecutive weeks with positive response was  7 from the non-imputed data vs 21 weeks in splenectomised and 34 in non-splenectomised from the imputed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

analyses.  Data  presented  are  useful  tools  to  know  the  maintenance  of  the  response  and  the  effect  of romiplostim in the long term, which can be expected despite fluctuations in platelet counts over time.

The rescue medication used is highly variable across the studies, ranging from 9% in study 20060219  to 47% in study 20040209. In general the use seems more frequent in placebo/SOC treated patients compared to  romiplostim  treated  arms,  regardless  of  the  splenectomy  status.  Duration-adjusted  use  of  rescue medications per 100P/Y in non-splenectomised patients at any time was 153.3 in romiplostim and 540.3 in placebo/SOC, and in splenectomized was 263.4  in romiplostim and 850.0  in placebo/SOC. Moreover the rate of rescue medication use in romiplostim-treated (splenectomized and non-splenectomized) subjects declined over time, which is reassuring.

The incidence of platelet response was sufficient (&gt; 87%) among the subgroups of non-splenectomised and splenectomized with subgroups with ≤ 3 prior ITP therapies or &gt; 3 prior ITP therapies. The incidence of platelet response during different treatment periods was consistent for the first treatment year between subgroups for both non-splenectomised and splenectomized subjects. With longer treatment years the platelet response gradually declined in all subgroups for both non-splenectomised and splenectomized, in the group of splenectomized patients ≤ 3 prior ITP therapies response declined from 88.9% in the first 6 months to 56,5% after 4 years of treatment.  The MAH concludes that this might be due to smaller numbers after longer disease duration. However, the loss of platelet response only occurred in a small portion of the subjects which is reassuring.

In the pooled analysis data regarding the previous lines of therapy was lacking for both splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients. It is therefore not possible to assess the previous lines of therapy and reason not to have undergone splenectomy in this patient group

32% of the patients had a disease duration &lt; 6 months, the short disease duration is likely a reason not to have had a splenectomy (yet). The data presented by the MAH has given no ground for any concern regarding the efficacy, which has shown a platelet response of &gt;87%, in patients with &lt; 3 or &gt; 3 lines of previous therapy or other subgroup analysis based on disease duration

The results of Study 20060131 are of interest. The study demonstrated the superiority of  romiplostim over medical SOC in terms of lower rates of splenectomy and treatment failure, but it is uncertain to what extent these medical intervention were standardized to allow firm conclusions. The overall subject incidence of splenectomy was 8.9% (14 of 157 subjects) in the romiplostim group compared with 36.4% (28 of 77 subjects) in the SOC group. The p-value for the treatment difference between groups was &lt; 0.0001, with an odds ratio (romiplostim vs SOC) of 0.17 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.35), indicating that the odds of undergoing a splenectomy was statistically significantly lower in the romiplostim group than the SOC group. For the co-primary endpoint, the overall subject incidence of treatment failure was 11.5% (18 of 157 subjects) in the romiplostim group compared with 29.9% (23 of 77 subjects) in the SOC group. The p-value for the treatment difference between groups was 0.0005, with an odds ratio (romiplostim vs SOC) of 0.31 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.61), indicating that the odds of experiencing treatment failure was statistically significantly lower in the romiplostim group than the SOC group. Platelet responses were also consistently achieved by a higher proportion of subjects in the romiplostim group compared with those in the SOC group starting from week 2. Poisson regression analyses indicated that romiplostim subjects were 2.3 times more likely to have a platelet response than subjects in the SOC group (p &lt; 0.0001).

Results  from  Studies  in  the  Japanese  population:  Romiplostim  was  statistically  significantly  superior  to placebo for the primary efficacy endpoint, number of weeks with weekly platelet response (platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L), with a median (Q1,Q3) of 0 (0,0) in placebo and 11(9,12) in romiplostim groups, (being 11 weeks and 10.5 weeks in splenectomized and non-splenectomised patients, respectively). All secondary efficacy endpoints support the efficacy of romiplostim. Romiplostim decreased the incidence of bleeding symptoms from 63.6% of subjects at baseline to 31.8% of subjects at weeks 5 and 9 and to 36.4% of subjects at week 13 (end of treatment). In the all postdose period, 100% of placebo subjects and 72.7% of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

romiplostim subjects had bleeding symptoms. From the 20060113 study, of the 17 subjects who underwent a splenectomy, 17 (100%) had a platelet response, and of the 27 subjects who had not had a splenectomy, 25 (92.6%) had a platelet response. The incidence of bleeding symptoms was similar during most 4-week periods in splenectomized subjects and nonsplenectomized subjects. Nine subjects (20.5% of the safety analysis set) received rescue medications at some point during the study. The percentage of subjects using rescue  medications  was  higher  among  splenectomized  subjects  than  nonsplenectomized  subjects  (6 subjects [35.3%] and 3 subjects [11.1%], respectively)

These results support the efficacy of romiplostim to increase platelet counts above a bleeding risk threshold for an individual patient. The effect appears to be maintained in the long-term, although beyond week 136 data show an important variability, what can be of concern for a treatment intended to be chronic. However, given that few patients were followed beyond week 136 (nearly half of the population enrolled), conclusions should be taken cautiously.  No  major  differences  were  seen  between  splenectomized  and  non splenectomized patients in terms of maintenance of the response in the long-term. It is noted that a higher portion of non-splectomized than splenectomized subjects were able to discontinue concurrent ITP therapy (43.8% vs 22.2%). The magnitude of the response tends to be in general superior in non-splenectomised patients, which is not unexpected given the less advanced status of the disease in these patients while splenectomized patients usually represent a more refractory population.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Romiplostim is efficient in terms of increasing platelet counts above a level, thus decreasing the risk of bleeding events in subjects with chronic ITP after failure to prior first line ITP treatment. The effect is seen regardless  of  whether  patients  had  undergone  prior  splenectomy  and  appears  to  be  maintained  in  the long-term with appropriate dose adjustments.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

Safety results from an analysis of pooled data from 13 studies (Studies 20000137A, 20000137B, 20010218, 20030105, 20030212, 20030213, 20040209, 20050162, 20060113, 20060131, 20060216, 20080009, and 20080435)  are  presented  in  this  summary;  results  are  shown  by  splenectomy  status  at  the  time  of enrolment. The data from the analysis of pooled data from the 13 clinical studies reported within this submission contain data on exposure to romiplostim for up to 283 weeks.

In addition, 2 integrated long-term safety analyses of romiplostim have been published (Rodeghiero et al, 2013 and Cines et al, 2012 [abstract only]); key results of these analyses are summarized within this document. Available data from 2 postauthorization observational studies (Study 20101323 and 20070225) are also summarized.

- New data that were not included in the original marketing application.

A subgroup analysis of prior splenectomy status (at the time of enrollment) was conducted on all safety endpoints. For subjects who enrolled in an extension study, the splenectomy status at the time of enrollment in the parent study was carried forward.

## Patient exposure

A  total  of  1111  subjects  (age  ≥  18  years  at  screening)  received  investigational  product  in  studies 20000137A, 20000137B, 20010218, 20030105, 20030212, 20030213, 20040209, 20050162, 20060113, 20060131, 20060216, 20080009, and 20080435 . Of these, 1046 subjects received ≥ 1 dose of romiplostim (391 subjects with prior splenectomy and 655 with no prior splenectomy) The median (25th percentile [Q1], 75th percentile [Q3]) average weekly dose was 3.769 (1.939, 6.538) μg/kg/week in subjects with prior splenectomy and 3.327 (1.969, 5.763) μg/kg/week in subjects with no prior splenectomy. Median duration of exposure was 63.0 weeks in subjects with prior splenectomy and 66.0 weeks in subjects with no prior splenectomy.

## Disposition

A total of 716 subjects with no prior splenectomy were enrolled in a parent study and 225 in an open-label extension study; 613 and 224 of these subjects, respectively, received at least 1 dose of romiplostim, and 469 (76.5%) and 168 (75.0%) completed romiplostim The most frequent (&gt; 3% of subjects) reasons for discontinuation  of  romiplostim  were  adverse  event  full  consent  withdrawn,  requirement  for  alternative therapy, and other in the parent study and full consent withdrawn, requirement for alternative therapy, and death in the extension study.

A total of 395 subjects with prior splenectomy were enrolled in a parent study and 111 in an open-label extension study; 368 and 111 of these subjects, respectively, received at least 1 dose of romiplostim, and 266 (72.3%) and 67 (60.4%) completed romiplostim. The most frequent (&gt; 3% of subjects) reasons for discontinuation  of  romiplostim  were  adverse  event  full  consent  withdrawn,  requirement  for  alternative therapy, and protocol-specified criteria in the parent study and adverse event, full consent withdrawn, requirement for alternative therapy, subject request, and other in the extension study.

## Baseline Demographics and Disease Characteristics

In the adult ITP safety set, 60.2% of the subjects with no prior splenectomy were women, 77.1% were white, and the median age was 53.0 years (range 18 to 93 years). The median (25th percentile [Q1], 75th percentile [Q3]) time since ITP diagnosis was 1.62 (0.33, 5.39) years , and the median baseline platelet count was 19.3 x 109/L (Table 1-6). Most (72.3%) of these subjects had prior ITP treatment history; the most frequent (&gt; 20% of subjects with available history) were corticosteroid (96.1%), intravenous (IV) immune gamma globulin (52.1%), rituximab (20.1%), and Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy (31.6%).

Among subjects with prior splenectomy, 64.3% were women, 85.6% were white, and the median age was 52.0 years (range 18 to 88 years) . The median (Q1, Q3) time since ITP diagnosis was 8.71 (3.55, 17.91) years , the median baseline platelet count was 14.0 x 109/L , and the median time since splenectomy was 6.38  years  .  Approximately  half  (47.3%)  of  these  subjects  had  prior  ITP  treatment  history;  the  most

As noted above, the median time since ITP diagnosis was 1.62 years in subjects with no prior splenectomy and 8.71 years in subjects with prior splenectomy, and the median baseline platelet count was 19.3 x 109/L in subjects with no prior splenectomy and 14.0 x 109/L in subjects with prior splenectomy. Thus, in general, the subjects with prior splenectomy represented a more advanced ITP population

## Adverse events

Among subjects administered romiplostim, adverse events were reported in 610 (93.1%) subjects with no prior splenectomy and 377 (96.4%) subjects with prior splenectomy; CTCAE grade ≥ 3 adverse events were reported in 251 (38.3%) and 182 (46.5%) subjects, respectively; serious adverse events were reported in 201 (30.7%) and 153 (39.1%) subjects; and fatal adverse events were reported in 31 (4.7%) and 11 (2.8%) subjects

Among subjects administered romiplostim, the total number of adverse events reported (duration-adjusted event  rate  per  100  subject-years)  was  9624  (851.9)  in  subjects  with  no  prior  splenectomy  and  8609 (1226.3) in subjects with prior splenectomy. The most frequently reported adverse events (duration-adjusted event rate ≥ 20 per 100 subject-years, descending order of frequency) were headache, contusion, nasopharyngitis, fatigue, and epistaxis in subjects with no prior splenectomy; and headache, contusion,  epistaxis,  nasopharyngitis,  fatigue,  arthralgia,  petechiae,  diarrhea,  upper  respiratory  tract infection, and nausea in subjects with prior splenectomy.

Among subjects administered  romiplostim,  the  total  number  of  investigational  product-related  adverse events reported (duration-adjusted event rate per 100 subject-years) was 928 (82.1) in subjects with no prior splenectomy and 864 (123.1) in subjects with prior splenectomy

The most frequently reported investigational product-related adverse events (duration-adjusted event rate ≥  5  per  100  subject-years,  descending  order  of  frequency)  were  headache  in  subjects  with  no  prior splenectomy and headache, fatigue, myalgia, and arthralgia in subjects with prior splenectomy.

Among subjects administered romiplostim, CTCAE grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported in 251 (38.3%) subjects with no prior splenectomy and 182 (46.5%) subjects with prior splenectomy

## Deaths

Among subjects administered romiplostim, fatal adverse events were reported in 31 (4.7%) subjects with no prior splenectomy and 11 (2.8%) subjects with prior splenectomy The fatal adverse events were deemed related to romiplostim by the investigator in 3 subjects with no prior splenectomy (intestinal ischemia, myocardial infarction, and angina unstable) and 2 subjects with prior splenectomy (hemolysis and aplastic anemia)

The 3 subjects with fatal outcomes due to intestinal ischemia, hemolysis and aplastic anemia were enrolled in Study 20040209. To be eligible for this study, subjects were to have received at least 1 prior therapy for ITP, and had a platelet count of ≤ 30 x 109/L and/or experienced bleeding that was uncontrolled with conventional therapies.

·  A  death  due  to  intestinal  ischemia  had  hepatopathy  (hepatitis  B  and  C)  at  baseline  with  portal  vein thrombosis prior to experiencing intestinal ischemia; a clinical picture of sepsis, along with a 50% decrease in  hematocrit  and  lower  gastrointestinal  bleeding;  low  platelet  count;  therefore,  underlying  ITP  was  a possible contributory factor for the event.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· Death due to hemolysis along with a urinary tract infection and failure of antibiotic therapy in the previous week.  The  subject  was  then  hospitalized  and  experienced  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation. Refractory ITP and exposure to antibiotic therapy were possible contributory factors for the reported event.

· Death due to aplastic anemia / macrocytic anemia at baseline and a low platelet count at the time of the reported event.

Fatal outcomes due to myocardial infarction and unstable angina in Study 20030213 (open-label, extension study evaluating the safety and efficacy of long-term dosing of romiplostim).

· Pre-existing risk factors identified for the subject with myocardial infarction included hypertension (not uncontrolled)  and  type  2  diabetes.  No  thrombocytosis  was  reported  3  weeks  prior  to  the  event,  and romiplostim dosing was stable.

· Pre-existing risk factors identified for the subject with angina unstable included stable angina for several years  prior  to  starting  romiplostim,  hypercholesterolemia,  atrial  fibrillation,  and  familial  cardiovascular history. Triple vessel disease (diagnosed during romiplostim therapy) was likely a significant contributory factor for the reported event. Thrombocytosis was not reported on the day of the fatal event, although elevated troponin was. It was not possible following 2 bypasses on that day to wean the patient from an artificial heart.

## Study 20080009

Study  20080009  was  a  prospective,  phase  4,  open-label,  multi-center  study  designed  to  evaluate  the changes in bone marrow reticulin and collagen in adult subjects receiving romiplostim once weekly for 3 years for the treatment of thrombocytopenia associated with ITP. Subjects were enrolled in 1 of 3 cohorts, with on-study bone marrow biopsies performed at baseline and at year 1 (Cohort 1), year 2 (Cohort 2), or

Page 2of2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

year 3 (Cohort 3). Thus, bone marrow abnormalities were collected in a more systematic manner in Study 20080009 compared with the other ITP studies included in the adult ITP safety set. Therefore, data from Study 20080009 were excluded from the analysis and are summarized separately below.

## Collagen

Of the 169 subjects enrolled in Study 20080009, 132 (78.1%) had evaluable bone marrow trichrome stain results to assess collagen during the study. Among subjects with evaluable bone marrow results, 0 of 35 subjects developed collagen within 1 year of romiplostim treatment (Cohort 1); 0 of 39 subjects developed collagen within 2 years of romiplostim treatment (Cohort 2), and 2 of 58 subjects (3.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.4%, 11.9%) developed collagen within 3 years of romiplostim treatment (Cohort 3). One of the 2 subjects who developed collagen had no evidence of collagen at the follow-up bone marrow biopsy 12 weeks after discontinuation of romiplostim. This subject is not believed to represent a typical ITP patient since this subject showed no response and remained thrombocytopenic after trials of multiple standard ITP therapies; this subject did not have prior splenectomy before enrollment in the study. The biopsy for the other subject was performed after the subject completed 3 years of romiplostim treatment, and the subject refused the follow-up bone marrow biopsy; this subject had prior splenectomy before enrollment in the study.

## Reticulin

Nine of 131 subjects showed an increase in modified Bauermeister grade by ≥ 2 severity grades or an increase to grade 4 by silver staining: 0 of 34 subjects within 1 year of romiplostim treatment (Cohort 1); 2 of 39 subjects (5.1%, 95% CI: 0.6%, 17.3%) within 2 years of romiplostim treatment (Cohort 2); and 7 of 58 subjects (12.1%, 95% CI: 5.0%, 23.3%) within 3 years of romiplostim treatment (Cohort 3). Three of the 9 subjects with an increase in modified Bauermeister grade by ≥ 2 severity grades or an increase to grade  4  had  prior  splenectomy  before  enrollment  in  this  study.  As  the  presence  of  collagen  defines  a modified Bauermeister grade of 4, the 2 subjects who met the primary collagen endpoint also met this secondary endpoint (ie, they comprise 2 of the 9 subjects). Two of the 7 subjects who met this endpoint on reticulin  alone  had  repeat  bone  marrow  biopsies;  both  subjects  showed  return  to  baseline  modified Bauermeister grade.

A higher percentage of subjects in the romiplostim arm compared with the  placebo/ standard of care (SOC) arm experienced predefined adverse events of hematopoietic erythropenia and leukocytosis (13% vs 6%). The median time to first occurrence of hematopoietic erythropenia and leukocytosis was 17 weeks (min: 1; max: 319) in the romiplostim arm and 10.5 weeks (min: 4; max: 55) in the placebo/SOC arm

## Anti-Romiplostim Antibody Analysis

Analysis of anti-romiplostim antibodies was not included as part of the analysis of pooled data from 13 studies conducted in support of this variation. However based on a previously conducted analysis with a data cut-off of 31 July 2014, 4 (0.4%) subjects in the ITP safety set were positive for neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim. Anti-romiplostim neutralizing antibodies were detected in samples from 2 subjects in Study 20030213,  1  subject  in  Study  20080009,  and  1  subject  in  Study  20080435.  None  of  the  4  subjects demonstrated cross-reactivity to TPO. Of these 4 subjects, 3 subjects (1 subject in Study 20030213, 1 subject in Study 20080009, and 1 subject in Study 20080435) had no prior splenectomy and 1 subject (Study  20030213)  had  prior  splenectomy.  In  the  postmarketing  immunogenicity  registry  study  (Study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

20080091),  2  subjects  tested  positive  for  binding  and  neutralizing  antibodies  to  romiplostim  with  no cross-reactive antibodies to TPO. Of these 2 subjects, 1 subject had no prior splenectomy 1 subject had prior splenectomy.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Among subjects administered romiplostim, adverse events leading to discontinuation of romiplostim were reported in 54 (8.2%) subjects with no prior splenectomy and 31 (7.9%) subjects with prior splenectomy

Among subjects administered romiplostim, the total number of adverse events leading to discontinuation of romiplostim reported (duration-adjusted event rate per 100 subject-years) was 66 (5.8) in subjects with no prior splenectomy and 36 (5.1) in subjects with prior splenectomy. The most frequently reported adverse events leading to discontinuation of romiplostim (duration-adjusted event rate ≥ 0.3 per 100 subject-years, descending  order  of  frequency)  were  myocardial  infarction,  pulmonary  embolism  and  renal  failure  in subjects  with  no  prior  splenectomy  and  bone  marrow  disorder,  arthralgia,  deep  vein  thrombosis,  and pulmonary embolism in subjects with prior splenectomy.

Study  20101323  (FOCUS)  was  a  retrospective  observational  postauthorizaton  study  to  evaluate  real prescribing conditions (therapeutic indications and prescription patterns) of romiplostim in thrombocytopenic patients in France. During this study, 3/108 (2.8%) subjects (2/44 [4.5%] splenectomized; 1/64 [1.6%] nonsplenectomized) experienced at least 1 concomitant event considered to be related to romiplostim as follows: 1/44 (2.3%) splenectomized subject experienced a concomitant event of antiphospholipid syndrome, 1/44 (2.3%) splenectomized subject experienced a concomitant event of renal vein thrombosis, and 1/64 (1.6%) nonsplenectomized subject experienced a concomitant event of alopecia.

Study 20070225 is an ongoing long-term observational postauthorization study (to be completed in 2015) of romiplostim use in European routine clinical practice. Based on an interim analysis conducted in September 2013, serious ADRs were reported in 4/116 (3%) splenectomized subjects and 9/196 (4%) nonsplenectomized subjects. A total of 2/116 (2%) splenectomized subjects reported thrombotic ADRs (myocardial infarction [1 subject] and  transient ischemic attack [1 subject]),  and  5/196  (3%) nonsplenectomized  subjects  reported  thrombotic  ADRs  (deep  vein  thrombosis  [2  subjects],  pulmonary embolism [2 subjects], embolism [1 subject], and retinal vein thrombosis [1 subject]). Bone marrow fibrosis ADRs were reported in 1/116 (1%) splenectomized subjects and 1/196 (1%) nonsplenectomized subjects. No fatal ADRs were reported (Papadaki et al, 2014).

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The main reason to restrict the therapeutic indication of romiplostin at the time of the initial MA to a third line of treatment after failure to splenectomy (unless this were contraindicated) was safety due to the limitations of the safety database and the uncertainties around a novel mechanism of action. In order to solve these gaps the Applicant has submitted a complete safety analysis that includes data from all adult patients who have received romiplostin in the context of any of the 13 clinical studies conducted so far.

In addition, two observational studies, Study 201001323 (a retrospective observational study conducted in France) and  a long term observational, Study 20070225, which is ongoing, have been conducted but these data  are  not  included  in  the  main  analysis.  Study  20101323  included  108  subjects;  44  subjects  were splenectomised and 64 subjects were nonsplenectomized. Study 20070225 is ongoing and includes 312 subjects as of September 2013; 116 subjects were splenectomized and 196 subjects were nonsplenectomized. Available data from a postmarketing immunogenicity registry study (Study 20080091) is also included.

A total of 1111 subjects have been included in these studies, 1046 received at least one dose of romiplostim (391 with prior splenectomy and 655 with no prior splenectomy). The duration of exposure was (median;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

IQR)  63  weeks  (24w,  154w)  and  66  weeks  (31w,  126w)  in  splenectomized  and  non-splenectomized, respectively.  Median  (IQR)  weekly  dose  (µg/Kg/week)  were  3.7  (1.9,  6.5)  and  3.3  (1.9,  5.7)  in splenectomized and non-splenectomized, respectively.

In general, a higher percentage of splenectomized patients discontinued investigational medication than non-splenectomised subjects, either in parent studies (28.9 vs 25.6%) or in open label extension studies (39.6% vs 25.0%). It is remarkable that more subjects discontinued the IP treatment due to death in non-splenectomised patients compared to splenectomized 2.4% vs 1.5% in parent studies and 5.4% vs 2.7% in open-label studies.

Overall,  baseline  demographic  and  disease  characteristics  were  rather  consistent  in  the  two  subset  of splectomized and non-splenectomised patients, although patients with prior splenectomy represented a more advanced cITP population, with a median time since ITP diagnosis of 8.71 years  longer than that of the non-splenectomised  population  (1.62  years  since  diagnosis).  At  baseline  the  splenectomized  and non-splenectomised group were comparable with respect to age and sex. The non-splenectomised group had a higher percentage of Japanese patients (14%) then the splenectomized group (4.6%). It is uncertain what the difference in race or local treatment guideline has on the comparability of the studied population as a whole.

The median baseline platelet count was 19.3 x 109/L in non-splenectomised subjects and 14.0 x 109/L in splenectomized subjects. The median time since splenectomy was 6.38 years and 47,3% had prior IPT treatment history which consisted of first line therapy.

Of the patients with a prior splenectomy only half of the group had received first line therapy, more details on the group that did not receive first line therapy is requested. Moreover,  it is remarkable that the patients with  splenectomy  had  more  different  types  of  second  line  treatment  options  whereas  the  nonsplenectomized patients only had rituximab and H.pylori eradication therapy as previous treatments.

Not all patients included in the analysis can be classified as chronic ITP patients, with a significant amount of patients having a disease duration of &lt; 6 months. The data provided indicate that romiplostim is well tolerated regardless of whether patients had undergone splenectomy or not . The safety profile does not appear to differ with disease duration or previous treatment lines, but is generally more favourable in non-splenectomised patients. Differences in favour of the non-splenectomised population are not totally unexpected given the generally more advanced status of splenectomised patients which, in addition,  are also more at risk of infections.

Therefore, information about adverse events by preferred term reported as duration-adjusted event rate per 100 subjects-years was requested in the following analysis: related adverse events, grade &gt;3 adverse events, serious adverse events and serious related adverse events with the reporting of all patients.While the incidence of treatment related adverse events is higher in the romiplostim treated patients, the analysis adjusted by exposure (per 100 subjects-years, n/Pt-yr*100) show more favourable results for romiplostim except for the non-splenectomised patients for the rate of drug related adverse events (82.1 vs 36.9 in romiplostim and placebo) and for splenectomized patients with regard to  related serious adverse events (9.3 vs 0.0 in romiplostim and placebo). Within splenectomized patients, the small number of subjects in the placebo  arm  /SOC  (only  27)  precludes  drawing  reliable  conclusions.  For  non-splenectomised  patients, despite the differences found in the overall incidence of related AE, the incidence of severe AE and &gt;G3 AEs was systematically higher in the placebo/SOC treatment arms, which it is reassuring.

Overall, data available show no major differences in the profile and frequency of adverse events among splenectomized  and  non-splenectomised  subjects,  although  splenectomized  patients  showed  higher frequencies of CTCAE grade 3 (46.5% vs 38.3%), product-related adverse events (123.1 vs 82.1 event rate per 100 subject -year), and the total number of serious adverse events reported (68.1 vs 44.1 SAE rate adjusted per 100 subject-years). This is not unexpected given the more advanced status of the disease in the splenectomized population. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of romiplostim were reported in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

8.2% of subjects with no prior splenectomy and 7.9% of subjects with prior splenectomy. Likewise, when adverse events leading to discontinuation were adjusted for duration of exposure, subjects with no prior splenectomy had a numerically higher duration-adjusted event rate per 100 subject-years compared with subjects with prior splenectomy (5.8 vs 5.1, respectively).

There were no major differences in the incidence of product related adverse events, except for \"myalgia\", reported in 2.7% vs 5.6% in non-splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients, respectively. Also, for the incidence of product related serious adverse events in bone marrow disorders 0% in non-splenectomised and 1.5% in splenectomized patients, this is not totally unexpected.

However, it is noted that more non-splenectomised patients had fatal adverse events (4.7% vs 2.8%). Nevertheless, the incidence of treatment related fatal adverse events was 0.5% in each group. The fatal adverse  events  were  deemed  related  to  romiplostim  by  the  investigator  in  3  subjects  with  no  prior splenectomy (intestinal ischemia, myocardial infarction, and angina unstable) and 2 subjects with prior splenectomy (hemolysis and aplastic anemia). A brief description in each patient has been given. Likewise, when fatal adverse events were adjusted for duration of exposure, subjects with no prior splenectomy had a numerically higher duration-adjusted event rate per 100 subject-years compared with subjects with prior splenectomy (2.7 vs 1.6, respectively)

Serious adverse events were reported in 30.7% subjects with no prior splenectomy and 39.1% subjects with prior splenectomy. Likewise, when serious adverse events were adjusted for duration of exposure, subjects with no prior splenectomy had a numerically lower duration-adjusted event rate per 100 subject-years compared with subjects with prior splenectomy (44.1 vs 68.1, respectively). Thrombocytopenia was the most frequently reported serious adverse event (5.2% and 6.4% of subjects, respectively). Duration-adjusted analyses showed similar results. The most frequently reported serious adverse events (duration-adjusted  event  rate  ≥  3  per  100  subject-years,  descending  order  of  frequency)  were thrombocytopenia in subjects with no prior splenectomy and thrombocytopenia and ITP in subjects with prior splenectomy.

With regard to the incidence of bone marrow reticulin/collagen, 7 (1.3%) non-splenectomised subjects and 11(3.3%) splenectomized subjects had bone marrow reticulin/collagen, being the adjusted rate per 100 patients years (95%IC)  2.0 (1.0,3.5) vs 0.8 (0.3, 1.7) in splenectomized and non-splenectomised subjects. Again, this is not totally unexpected given the more advanced status of splenectomized patients.

The  number  and  percentages  of  subjects  reporting  thrombocytopenia  after  cessation  of  romiplostim treatment was 24 (3.7%) in non-splenectomised and 10 (2.6%) in splenectomized.  Overall, 34 subjects (3%)  experienced  thrombocytopenia  after  cessation  of  romiplostim  treatment.  The  total  number  of thrombocytopenia events after cessation of romiplostim treatment (duration-adjusted event rate per 100 patient-years) was 37 (19.4).

In the non-splenectomised group, 655 subjects with ITP who received romiplostim (128.2 patient-years) were pooled and subject incidence rates and exposure-adjusted event rates (per 100 patient-years) were calculated  for  the  subjects  who  experienced  thrombocytopenia  events  after  cessation  of  romiplostim treatment.  A  total  of  24  subjects  (4%)  experienced  thrombocytopenia  after  cessation  of  romiplostim treatment.  The  total  number  of  thrombocytopenia  events  after  cessation  of  romiplostim  treatment (duration-adjusted event rate per 100 patient-years) was 25 (19.5).

In the splenectomized group, 391 subjects with ITP who received romiplostim (62.3 patient-years) were pooled  and  subject  incidence  rates  and  exposure-adjusted  event  rates  (per  100  patient-years)  were calculated  for  the  subjects  who  experienced  thrombocytopenia  events  after  cessation  of  romiplostim treatment.  A  total  of  10  subjects  (3%)  experienced  thrombocytopenia  after  cessation  of  romiplostim treatment.  The  total  number  of  thrombocytopenia  events  after  cessation  of  romiplostim  treatment (duration-adjusted event rate per 100 patient-years) was 12 (19.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Applicant has analyzed the subject incidence and study duration-adjusted rate of adverse events of interest, in splenectomized (702.0 pt-y) and non-splenectomised (1129.7 pt-yr) subjects. However in the analysis of myelofibrosis  other exposure-adjusted events rate were taken into account 560.0 pt-y and 866.7 pt-year in splenectomized and non-splenectomized. Bone marrow abnormalities were collected differently in Study 20080009  compared  with the other 12 clinical studies in adult subjects with  immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). More specifically, in Study 20080009, subjects were enrolled in 1 of 3 cohorts, with on-study bone marrow biopsies performed at baseline and at year 1 (cohort 1), year 2 (cohort 2), or year 3 (cohort  3).  Thus,  bone  marrow  abnormalities  were  collected  in  a  more  systematic  manner  in  Study 20080009 compared with the other studies. This approach is supported..

In addition, a greater rate of events (duration adjusted event rate per 100 subjects-years) in splenectomized patients than in non-splenectomised was reported for the following AEs: pulmonary disorders (220.5 vs 154.3),  hemorrhages  (266.1  vs  140.8),  hypersensitivity  /angioedema/  anaphylactic  reactions  (36.6  vs 28.8),  thombotic/thomboembolic  events  (6.3  vs  4.6),  thombocytosis  (2.6  vs  1.8)  and  hematologic malignancies (0.9 vs 0.7). By contrary the numbers of adverse events (duration adjusted event rate per 100 subjects-years) were greater in non-splenectomised patients than in splenectomized for the following:  renal and urinary disorders 118(10.4) vs 52(7.4), cardiac disorders 84(7.4) vs 48(6.8), myelofibrosis 5 (0.6) vs 2(0.4) and immunogenicity (0.1 vs 0.0).

Regardless of splenectomy status, a higher percentage of subjects in the romiplostim arm experienced predefined adverse events of hematopoietic erythropenia and leucocytosis compared with subjects in the placebo/SOC arm. Splenectomised subjects on Romiplostim treatment with at least a 2-grade shift in hematopoietic erythropenia or leucocytosis were investigated to search for a rationale. The majority had a clinical history of at least one risk factor/ possible alternative cause for either the hematopoietic erythropenia or leucocytosis component of the concurrent event.  Patients with events of hematopoietic erythropenia experienced previous bleeding manifestations of ITP or a variety of other aetiologies (e.g. anaemia). Regarding the leucocytosis, it is known that a splenectomy can result in increased susceptibility to infection. In section 4.4. of the SmPC it is added: 'Concurrent anaemia and leucocytosis (within a 4-week window) may occur in patients regardless of splenectomy status, but have been seen more often in patients who have had a prior splenectomy.'

Although the adjusted rate of bone marrow reticulin/collagen is highest in splenectomized, the adjusted rate of  myelofibrosis  is  greater  in  non-splenectomized.  In  any  case  the  incidence  is  small  to  draw  a  firm conclusion about this slight imbalance.

Five (0.8%) subjects with no prior splenectomy who received romiplostim had fatal hemorrhage adverse events (hemorrhage intracranial [2 subjects], cerebral hemorrhage, pulmonary hemorrhage, and subdural hematoma [1 subject, each]). No subject with prior splenectomy who received romiplostim had a fatal hemorrhage adverse event.

Among subjects administered romiplostim, serious adverse events of renal failure (3 events were fatal) and acute renal failure (1 event was fatal) were each reported in 5 subjects with no prior splenectomy. Serious adverse events of acute prerenal failure, anuria, renal colic, renal disorder, renal failure chronic, urinary bladder polyp and urinary retention were reported in 1 subject each with no prior splenectomy. Serious adverse events of calculus urethral, renal colic, renal failure, renal failure acute, and urogenital hemorrhage were reported in 1 subject each with prior splenectomy .

Seven (0.6%) subjects with no prior splenectomy who received romiplostim had fatal cardiac disorder event. No subject with prior splenectomy who received romiplostim had a fatal cardiac event.

Six (0.5%) subjects with no prior splenectomy who received romiplostim had fatal thrombotic  events. One (0.1%) subject with prior splenectomy who received romiplostim had a fatal thromboembolic  event.

Malignancy adverse events and hematologic /myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) events occurred similarly in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

both subgroups of patients ( 3.8 and 3.4  event per 100 subjects-years and  in 0.7 and 0.9 event per 100 subjects-years in  non-splenectomised and splenectomized patients).

Bone marrow reticulin fibrosis was reported in 5(0.6) and 2 (0.4) non-splenectomised and splenectomized subjects,  in the study 20080009  BM reticulin fibrosis was reported in 5 non-splenectomised patietns (3 bone marrow reticulin fibrosis, 1 myelofibrosis and 1 reticulin increased) and 2  in splenectomized patietns.

With regard to anti-romiplostim antibody, the incidence of binding antibodies and neutralising antibodies is in line with that reflected in the SmPC, which is reassuring.

In general, both the safety profile and the general incidence of AEs are in line with that currently reflected in Section  4.8  of  the  SmPC.  Further  revisions  included  information  on  hematopoietic  erythropenia  and leukocytosis  which  occurs  more  often  in  patients  with  prior  splenectomy.  In  addition  the  incidence  of 'anaemia' has been revised from 'uncommon' to 'common' under section 4.8 of the SmPC.

The imbalances observed in the description of some AEs of particular interest are taken cautiously given the above  mentioned  limitations  of  the  pooled  analysis  and  also  because  differences  in  favour  of  the non-splenectomised population would not be totally unexpected given the generally more advanced status of splenectomised patients. In fact, a higher incidence of grade &gt; 3 or serious adverse events had been reported in these patients. However, data provided allow concluding that treatment with romiplostin is generally well tolerated regardless of whether patients had undergone splenectomy or not. With regard to anti-romiplostim antibody formation, the incidence of binding antibodies and neutralising antibodies is in line with that reflected in the SmPC, which is reassuring.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The data presented do not raise any particular concern. The safety profile and the general incidence of AEs from this submission are in line with that reflected in Section 4.8 of the  SmPC. Hematopoietic erythropenia and leukocytosis occurs more often in patients with prior splenectomy; the SmPC was amended accordingly.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

CHMP agreed with the MAH that no RMP update is needed. The safety profile of patients treated with romiplostim does not appear to differ based on splenectomy status, providing physicians with more options for treatment. Also the benefit risk remains positive and the indication remains second line for patients refractory to other treatments. RMP submitted within variation II/0049, includes information on all the clinical studies used to support this change to the indication and therefore has not been updated for this submission.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the contact details of the local representatives in the Package Leaflet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

The amended indication for Nplate to include all non-splenectomised patients (including those without a contraindication  to  surgery)  does  not  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  Package  Leaflet.  The  minor amendments that have been implemented do not require carrying out further consultation with target patients groups.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The MAH has conducted a pooled analysis of the data obtained from 9 clinical trials (phase III, IV and II), which includes a total of 1024 subjects (376 with prior splenectomy and 648 with no prior splenectomy).

The  subject  incidence  of  platelet  count  between  50  x10 9 /L  and  200x10 9 /L  show  a  high  percentage  of responders in the first 6 months of treatment (276/376; 73.4% and 554/648; 85.5% in splenectomized and non-splenectomized).  During  treatment  with  romiplostim  the  number  of  months  with  platelet  counts between  50-200  x10 9 /L  was  (median  values)  6.0  months  and  10.0  months  in  splenectomized  and non-splenectomised patients. The subject's incidence of sustained platelet response was 67.6% and 79.9% in splenectomized and non-splenectomised sujects. Of these, few patients lost platelet responses during subsequent  treatment  (7.9%  in  splenectomized  and  6.9%  in  non-splenectomized).  Responses  were maintained in the long term, in some patients beyond fifth year, with a subject incidence of platelet count between 50 x10 9 /L and 200x10 9 /L which was 68.3% and 63.6%, in splenectomized and non-splenectomized, respectively.

In supportive Study 20060216 (Japanese population)  romiplostim was statistically significant superior to placebo for the primary efficacy endpoint, number of weeks with weekly platelet response (platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L): being median (Q1,Q3) of 0 (0,0) in placebo and 11(9,12) in romiplostim groups ( 11 weeks  and 10.5 weeks in splenectomized and non-splenectomised patietns). Secondary efficacy endpoints support the efficacy of romiplostim.

Eighty six percent (86.4%), 72.7% and 31.8% of the romiplostim treated patients achieved ≥ 100 x 10 9 /L, ≥ 200 x 10 9 /L, and ≥ 400 x 10 9 /L platelet counts. Romiplostim demonstrated an effect in decreasing the incidence of bleeding symptoms from 63.6% at baseline  to 36.4% at week 13. The effect appears to be maintained in the long-term, although beyond week 136 data show an important variability. No major differences were seen between splenectomized and non splenectomized patients in terms of maintenance of the  response  in  the  long-term.  Although  it  is  noted  that  a  higher  portion  of  non-splectomized  than splenectomized subjects was able to discontinue concurrent ITP therapy (43.8% vs 22.2%).

In phase II study 20060131 conducted in non-splenectomised patients, the overall subject incidence of splenectomy was 8.9% (14 of 157 subjects) in the romiplostim group compared with 36.4% (28 of 77 subjects) in the SOC (standard of care) group. The p-value for the treatment difference between groups was &lt; 0.0001.

The odd ratio of treatment failure was 0.17 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.35),  the overall subject incidence of treatment failure was 11.5% (18 of 157 subjects) in the romiplostim group compared with 29.9% (23 of 77 subjects) in the SOC group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Uncertainties around the limitations of pooling the controlled studies (with placebo 20030105, 20030212, 20060216,  with  standard  of  care  20060131)  and  non-comparative  studies  (20030213,  20040209, 20060113, 20080009 and 20080009) with a certain degree of heterogeneity, are acknowledged.

However the results obtained in the key endpoints assessed are robust and clinically relevant regardless the baseline characteristics mentioned, ensuring the efficacy is seen of romiplostim is seen in both non-splenectomised and splenectomised patients.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The safety profile shown in the pooled analysis does not highlight any new signals or an increase in the occurrence  or  severity  of  known  adverse  events.  The  description  of  adverse  event  and  the  frequency reported are in line with the safety profile reflected in Section 4.8 of the  SmPC. Further, no major differences were observed between splenectomized and non-splenectomised subjects in the safety profile, although splenectomized  patients  showed  a  higher  incidence  of  AE  grade  3  (46.5%  vs  38.3%),  product-related adverse events (duration-adjusted event rate per 100 subject -years) (123.1 vs 82.1), and the total number of serious adverse events reported (duration-adjusted event rate per 100 subject-years) (68.1 vs 44.1) compared to non-splenectomised patients.

Treatment with romiplostin appeared to be well tolerated, with an overall low rate of adverse events leading to discontinuation, which was balanced between non-splenectomised (8.2%, 5.8 rate per 100 subject-year) and splenectomized subjects (7.9%, 5.1 rate per 100 subject-year). Although there were more subjects that discontinued the IP treatment due to death in non-splenectomised patients compared with splenectomized 2.4% vs 1.5% in parent studies and 5.4% vs 2.7% in open-label studies, when accounting for romiplostin related deaths no differences were observed between these subsets of patients.

The incidence of bone marrow reticulin/collagen was 7 (1.3%) non-splenectomised subjects and 11(3.3%) splenectomized, being the adjusted rate per 100 patients years (95%IC)  2.0 (1.0,3.5) vs 0.8 (0.3, 1.7) in splenectomized and non-splenectomised subjects.

Some numerical imbalances have been reported in the incidence of adverse event and adverse event of special  interest,  which  were  higher  in  non-splenectomised  patients  than  in  splenectomized;  renal  and urinary disorders 118(10.4) vs 52(7.4), cardiac disorders 84(7.4) vs 48(6.8), myelofibrosis 5 (0.6) vs 2(0.4) and immunogenicity (0.1 vs 0.0). Data was adjusted by exposure time.

Malignancy adverse events and hematologic /MDS events occurred similarly in both subgroups of patients (3.8  and  3.4  event  per  100  subjects-years  and  in  0.7  and  0.9  event  per  100  subjects-years  in non-splenectomised and splenectomized patients).

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The consequence of a continuous treatment with romiplostin in the bone marrow remains to be established. Until further data become available from ongoing studies, a close monitoring of patients is required in line with current SmPC recommendations.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The benefits of romiplostim in terms of platelet count was initially demonstrated in the pooled analysis of submitted  trials  and  replicated  in  two  independent  randomised  clinical  trials  which  included  both splenectomized and non-splenectomised subjects with chronic ITP. Responses were durable and can be considered clinically relevant for both splenectomized and non-splenectomised patients. Additional evidence generated since the initial MAA provides further support to these results, which is considered a robust evidence for an uncommon orphan condition that may be life threatening and where limited therapeutic alternatives are available. Consistent favourable effects were also observed for the incidence of bleeding events (G1-4) and for the use of rescue medication which was generally low. However data on the reduction of severe bleeding events is lacking, therefore the relevance of the observed effect, though anticipated based on the effect on platelet counts, has not been unequivocally demonstrated.

The main safety concerns, potential and identified, are increased reticulin formation and bone marrow fibrosis,  thrombocythemia,  thromboembolic  events,  malignancies,  immunogenicity  and  effects  on  renal function. In the context of limited treatment options, benefits of the treatment are considered to overweigh the risks for patients with cITP.

## Benefit-risk balance

The benefit - risk balance in the indication as worded following the deletion of the restriction in non-splenectomised patients:

Nplate is indicated for adult chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins).

- is positive.

Relevant information is included in SmPC sections 5.1 and 4.2.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

Romiplostin is regarded as a suitable therapeutic option able to increase platelet counts above a level which reduces the risk of bleeding events in up to 70% of subjects (40% if splenectomised). Responses appear durable  and  consistent  regardless  of  whether  treatment  with  romiplostin  is  used  in  splenectomised  or non-splenectomised patients, although responses tend to be lower in splenectomised patients likely due to the more advanced status of the disease. The effect is considered clinically relevant, substantiated by a favourable  effect  observed  in  the  overall  incidence  of  bleeding  events.  However,  romiplostin  does  not provide a curative treatment option for cITP but rather a chronic palliative treatment; it is noted that, contrary  to  other  treatment  options  available,  romiplostin  does  not  interfere  with  the  underlying pathophysiological autoimmune disorder of the condition, but rather stimulates platelet production with the aim to compensate peripheral platelet destruction. Thus, remission is unlikely but has been observed in certain patients during romiplostin treatment. Although well tolerated, romiplostin may be associated to the risk of thromboembolic complications, bone marrow  fibrosis and progression to haematological malignancies.

Current guidelines indicate that surgery remains as an optimal treatment option for patients refractory to the  first  line  of  treatment,  however,  it  can  be  recognised  that  surgery  may  not  be  suitable  and/or  an immediate treatment option in all cases. Thus, based on the increased body of safety evidence, a positive benefit/risk balance for the use of Nplate in second line beyond those cases where surgery is contraindicated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

could  be  concluded.    In  non-splenectomised  patients,  the  option  of  splenectomy  should  be  regularly re-evaluated on an individual basis by the treating physician according to current treatment guidelines.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of Indication to include second line treatment of non-splenectomised patients; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the contact details of the local representatives in the Package Leaflet.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.
