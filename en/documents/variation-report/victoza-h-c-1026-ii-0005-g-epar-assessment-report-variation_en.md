## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Introduction

## About the product

Victoza  (liraglutide)  is  a  once-daily  human  glucagon-like  peptide-1  (GLP-1)  analogue.  Compared  to human GLP-1, liraglutide has a C16 fatty (palmitic) acid chain attached at position 26 (lysine) of the peptide, and has a lysine at position 34 replaced by an arginine. When administered subcutaneously (s.c.),  these  structural  modifications  result  in  PK  properties  of  the  compound  suitable  for  once  daily administration. Mode  of  action  trials  in  subjects  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  (T2DM)  have demonstrated  glucose  lowering,  increased  insulin  secretion,  restored  beta-cell  responsiveness  to increasing glucose concentrations and delayed gastric emptying after a single s.c. dose of liraglutide.

Victoza is administered as a once-daily s.c. injection, irrespective of meals, in either the upper arm, thigh or abdomen at therapeutic doses of 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg. The product is available in a 3 mL prefilled pen.

Victoza was approved throughout the European Union on 30 June 2009.

Victoza is indicated in adults who have type 2 diabetes to control their blood glucose level. Victoza is used together with:

-  metformin  or  a  sulphonylurea  (anti-diabetes  medicines)  in  patients  whose  glucose  levels  are  not satisfactorily controlled on metformin or a sulphonylurea used on their own at the maximum possible dose

-  metformin  and  a  sulphonylurea,  or  metformin  and  a  thiazolidinedione  in  patients  whose  glucose levels are not satisfactorily controlled despite treatment with two medicines.

## Problem statement

The  MAH  submitted  a  grouping  of  two  type  II  variations.  The  first  variation  application  was  an extension of the indication for Victoza for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with basal insulin in patients not achieving adequate glycaemic control with Victoza and metformin alone. The second variation was submitted by the MAH to include a warning in the Victoza SmPC that Victoza is not a substitute for insulin following spontaneous reported cases of ketoacidosis in patients switching from insulin to Victoza.

The variations submitted in the group are the following:

| Variation(s) requested   | Variation(s) requested                                                                                                                                                       | Type   |

| C.I.6.a                  | Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one                                                         | II     |
| C.I.4                    | Variations related to significant modifications of the Summary of Product Characteristics due in particular to new quality, pre-clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | II     |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## The scopes applied for by the MAH were as follows:

- -Extension of indication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in combination with basal insulin in patients not achieving adequate glycaemic control with Victoza and metformin alone: update to sections 4.1, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and consequential changes to sections 1 and 2 of the Package Leaflet.
- -Update to section 4.4 of the SmPC to include a warning that Victoza is not a substitute for insulin and  consequential  changes  to  section  2  of  the  Package  Leaflet,  following  post-marketing spontaneous reports of ketoacidosis in patients switching from insulin to Victoza. In addition the MAH has taken the opportunity to align the Annexes with version 7.3.1 of the QRD template and to  delete  the  DDPS  version  number  from  Annex IIB.  Minor  editorial  changes  have  been  made throughout  the  Annexes.  Finally  in  section  6  of  the  Package  Leaflet,  the  pictures  for  the instructions of using Victoza have been changed so that the fingers in the pictures are now white instead of yellow.

## Overall introduction

Two new clinical studies have been submitted by the MAH with this grouping of two type 2 variations:

- Clinical pharmacology trial NN2211-3673, to provide information on PK and PD of the basal insulin and liraglutide combination in patients with T2DM.
-  Clinical  study  NN2211-1842,  performed  in  T2DM  patients  to  investigate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of adding  basal  insulin  detemir  to  the  combination  therapy  of  liraglutide  and  metformin  when  these agents no longer provide adequate glycaemic control.

## Trials and Data Included in the Clinical Overview

## Confirmatory Phase 3b Efficacy and Safety Trial

Trial NN2211-1842 in insulin-naïve subjects with type 2 diabetes:

After a 12-week run-in period with metformin and liraglutide, two regimens were compared:

1: liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin

2: insulin detemir + liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin

## Supportive Phase 1 Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Trial

Trial NN2211-3673 in subjects with type 2 diabetes

Treatments:

-  liraglutide steady-state dose of 1.8 mg
-  insulin detemir 0.5 U/kg
-  liraglutide 1.8 mg + insulin detemir 0.5 U/kg

In  order  to  demonstrate  the  contribution  of  Victoza  in  the  efficacy  of  the  combination  metformin  + basal insulin + liraglutide therapy, the MAH identified comparable patient populations to provide data on  the  efficacy  and  the  safety  of  the  basal  insulin  and  metformin  combination.  The  following  three sources were used:

- Literature search
- An International Variability Evaluation (PREDICTIVE) search (PREDICTIVE™ is a global observational study including 30 countries following type 1 and type 2 patients initiated on Levemir. The primary objective of the study is to document the safety using Levemir)
- All available Levemir clinical trials were used to identify patients with comparable patient populations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## GCP

Both the clinical pharmacology and the confirmatory clinical trial were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and ICH Good Clinical Practice, as declared by the MAH.

## Information on Paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an EMA decision (P/288/2010) for the following condition(s):

-  Type 2 diabetes mellitus

on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## 1.2. Clinical aspects

## 1.2.1. Clinical Pharmacology

## Study NN2211-3673

This  clinical  pharmacology  study  was  an  open-label  phase  I  study  conducted  in  33  male  or  female, insulin-naïve subjects with type 2 diabetes. This study was designed to investigate whether the PK and PD  properties  of  insulin  detemir  and/or  liraglutide  would  be  affected  when  the  two  drugs  were  coadministered to subjects with type 2 diabetes. The objective of the trial was to compare the 24-hour concentration profile - the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-24h) - and the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) after administration of insulin detemir administered alone and when coadministered with liraglutide at a steady-state dose of 1.8 mg/day.

## Methods

Study NN2211-3673 was an open label phase I trial including a total of 33 men and women aged 18 years or more with type 2 diabetes.

## Study participants

According to the inclusion criteria the subjects were required to be insulin naïve subjects diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and treated with stable doses of OADs (one of which had to be metformin), body mass  index  (BMI)  of ≤ 45  kg/m2,  screening  glycosylated  haemoglobin  (HbA1c)  of  7-10%  on monotherapy and 7-9.5% on dual therapy, Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) ≤ 250 mg/dL at Visit 2, FPG ≥ 140 and ≤ 240 mg/dL at Visit 5.

## Study design (study NN2211-3673)

<!-- image -->

Following successful screening (Visit 1), subjects entered a 3-week washout period and discontinued oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs), other than metformin (subjects on metformin monotherapy preceded to the Visit 5 clamp). During the washout, weekly telephone contact visits and the glucose diary were reviewed. After the washout period (Visit 5-Day 1) all subjects had a 24 hr euglycaemic clamp (100 mg/dL)  following  dosing  with  0.5  U/kg  insulin  detemir  and  24  hour  serial  insulin  detemir  PK  was assessed. Following the detemir clamp, all subjects began a liraglutide titration (0.6 mg/day on days 28,  1.2  mg/day on days 9-15 and 1.8 mg/day on days 16-22). On Day 22, a 24 hour liraglutide PK profile  and euglycaemic clamp (following 1.8 mg liraglutide) was performed in all subjects. Subjects were  then  maintained  on  liraglutide  1.8  mg/day  for  another  14  days  with  a  telephone  contact visit/diary review on Day 29. At Visit 10 (Day 36), subjects had a third euglycaemic clamp following co-administration  of  liraglutide  (1.8  mg)  and  insulin  detemir  (0.5  U/kg).  The  liraglutide  and  insulin detemir PK profile was assessed. A final visit was scheduled at Day 42 ± 3 days (Visit 11).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

PK and PD properties were investigated in three euclycaemic clamp settings scheduled 2-3 weeks apart during an 11-week study period with metformin as the only background treatment.

For the assessment of the PK profile of Liraglutide plasma samples were collected at 0 min (pre-dose) and 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 24 hours post liraglutide dose.

For the assessment of the PK profile of insulin detemir samples (serum) were collected at 0 min (predose) and 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 24 hours post insulin detemir dose. The insulin detemir and liraglutide concentrations were determined with validated ELISA methods.

Information on the pharmacodynamic effects of the study medication was derived from the glucose infusion  rate  (GIR).  The  clamp  started  with  a  run  in  period  of  2  hours  before  start  of  medication, insulin was used in order to maintain blood glucose levels of 5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL). Basal insulin infusion was discontinued approximately 30 minutes prior to dosing. After administration of the study medication (insulin detemir, liraglutide or both) glucose infusion was used in order to obtain a blood glucose  level  of  5.5  mmol/L  (100  mg/dL)  ±  10%.  GIR  was  recorded.  The  clamp  procedure  was continued until blood glucose values reached &gt; 6.6 mmol/L (120 mg/dL) for at least two hours without glucose infusion. The Cmax of study drug should be achieved before glucose infusion can be stopped. When the clamp was discontinued prior to 24 hours, blood glucose concentrations were monitored for the remaining 24-hour post-dose period.

## Treatments

The treatments used in this study included insulin detemir (0.5 U/kg) and liraglutide 1.8mg. A single dose of insulin detemir was given at Visit 5, Day 1 and Visit 10, Day 36. Liraglutide was self-titrated to 1.8mg from Day 2 to Day 22 upon which it was administered at steady state for clamp procedural activity. Subjects then maintained the liraglutide 1.8mg dose for two weeks after which liraglutide and insulin detemir were co-administered for the final clamp procedure on Day 36.

Subjects were directed to administer insulin detemir in the abdomen and liraglutide consistently in one location throughout the trial (either in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm) once daily by subcutaneous injections with the pen-injector. Metformin was considered a background treatment and was regarded as a non-investigational product.

## Analytical methods

The analytical reports and method validation reports of the determination for liraglutide in plasma and the  determination  of  insulin  detemir  were  submitted.  The  insulin  detemir  concentrations  were determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. The liraglutide concentrations were determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method.

## Outcome/endpoints

## ▪ Efficacy

Primary  endpoint  was  the  ratio  of  insulin  detemir  AUC 0-24h and  Cmax  (from  liraglutide  and  insulin detemir co-administration clamp divided by insulin detemir alone clamp).

The secondary endpoints included:

-  tmax for insulin detemir
-  Liraglutide steady state AUC0-24h, Cssmax, Cssmin, Cssav and tmax
-  Clamp AUCGIR 0-24h, tGIRmax and GIRmax for three clamps

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  AUC, Cmax and Cmin for plasma insulin, C-peptide and glucagon concentrations (insulin detemir, liraglutide and liraglutide co-administered with insulin detemir)
- Safety

Safety was evaluated by monitoring of treatment-emergent adverse events, incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes, physical examination, vital signs, ECG, medical events of special interest and clinical laboratory tests (including liraglutide antibodies).

## Statistical Methods

## ▪ Efficacy

The summary statistics and statistical analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints were based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The FAS was defined as all treated subjects exposed to at least one dose of the trial product.

To compare insulin detemir (Levemir) AUC0-24h and Cmax (with vs. without liraglutide co-administration) the  ratio  of  the  AUC 0-24h and  C max of  both  treatments  were  compared  using  a  linear  mixed  effect model. Treatment (with or without liraglutide) was included as fixed factor and subject as a random factor. From this model, the geometric mean treatment ratio was estimated, and a 90% confidence interval  for  this  was  calculated.  If  the  90%  confidence  interval  lies  entirely  within  the  no  effect boundary interval 0.80-1.25, it was concluded that there is no PK interaction.

To  compare  liraglutide  steady  state  PK  parameters  AUC 0-24h and  Cssmax  (with  vs.  without  insulin detemir  co  administration),  the  analysis  was  performed  in  the  same  manner  as  for  the  primary endpoints.

To  compare  clamp  parameters  GIRmax  and  AUCGIR0-24h between insulin  detemir  and  insulin  detemir with co administration of liraglutide, the clamp parameters GIRmax and AUCGIR0-24h  were (after logtransformation) analysed separately using a linear mixed effect model with treatment (insulin detemir alone, liraglutide alone, and insulin detemir with co-administration of liraglutide) as fixed factor and subject  as  a  random  factor.  Pair  wise  comparisons  were  made  between  insulin  detemir  and  insulin detemir with co-administration of liraglutide and  between  liraglutide and  liraglutide with coadministration of insulin detemir.

- Safety

Safety endpoints included biochemistry, haematology with differential, urinalysis, physical examinations, vital signs, ECG, FPG and adverse event monitoring. Summary statistics for FPG in raw scale and change from baseline at each scheduled visit were provided. Hypoglycaemic episodes were classified according to ADA definition. Hypoglycaemic episodes were summarised on ADA definition and minor hypoglycaemic episodes definition.

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 33 male and female subjects ( ≥ 18 years of age) were randomised and enrolled in the study, 32 subjects  completed the study. One subject withdrew consent on Visit 5, Day 1 after receiving a dose of insulin detemir and partially completing the clamp procedure. This subject was included in the full analysis set (used for safety analyses), but not the PK or PD analysis set.

The  sum  of  the  mean  AUC GIR for  liraglutide  (1982  mg/kg)  and  insulin  detemir  (1058  mg/kg)  given individually was similar to that obtained when the two were given in combination (2947 mg/kg).

C-peptide average (AVG0-24hr) and maximum concentration (Cmax) was greatest when liraglutide was administered alone (950.3 pmol/L and 1348.0 pmol/L, respectively).

The plasma insulin data was inconclusive as the assay did not discriminate between endogenous insulin and insulin detemir

Glucagon  average  (AVG0-24hr)  and  C max were  greatest  when  insulin  detemir  was  given  alone  (65.1 pg/mL and 92.1 pg/mL, respectively).

## ▪ Safety

A  total  of  32  subjects  experienced  a  total  of  107  adverse  events  over  the  duration  of  the  trial.  On clamp procedure days, 14 (42.4%) subjects treated with insulin detemir, 17 (51.5%) subjects treated with  liraglutide,  and  13  (39.4%)  subjects  treated  with  both  insulin  detemir  and  liraglutide  had treatment emergent adverse events. Out of these 32 subjects, 15 (45.5%) subjects  experiencing a total  of  24adverse  events  which  were  potentially  treatment  related,  with  the  majority  of  subjects (39.4%)  having  adverse  events  following  liraglutide  administration  during  the  liraglutide  dose escalation period. The majority of adverse events were judged as 'unlikely' to be related to treatment.

The  most  frequently  occurring  TEAEs  (occurring  in  &gt;10%  of  subjects)  were  abdominal  discomfort, diarrhoea, nausea, weight decrease, and headache. In four subjects decreased weight was reported and 4 injection site reactions were reported during the study period. No adverse events led to study discontinuation. All adverse events were mild to moderate. No severe AEs were reported. No serious adverse events or deaths were reported. Three asymptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes in 2 subjects were reported.

## 1.2.2. Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology

The design of the study was considered suitable by the CHMP to assess the influence of liraglutide on the PK profile of insulin detemir and vice versa. The term 'basal insulin' as proposed by the MAH in section  4.1  of  the  SmPC  was  considered  too  broad  by  the  CHMP  as  other  long-acting  insulins  have different PK profile compared to insulin detemir. The MAH was requested to amend 'basal insulin' by 'insulin detemir' as only clinical pharmacology data on the combination liraglutide-insulin detemir has been provided with this application.

Information  derived  from  the  glucose  infusion  rate  (GIR)  is  an  acceptable  method  to  study pharmacodynamic interaction. The inclusion criteria for this study have been properly motivated by the MAH.  The  withdrawal  of  one  study  subject  was  sufficiently  justified  according  to  the  CHMP.  The analytical  methods  presented  by  the  MAH  were  considered  acceptable  and  properly  validated.  The primary and secondary endpoints and the statistical methods were considered acceptable for this type of  study.  No  pharmacokinetic  interaction  was  observed  during  this  PK/PD  study.  According  to  the predefined no  effect boundary  of  [0.8, 1.25], liraglutide at steady state did not affect the pharmacokinetic  endpoints  (AUC,  Cmax)  of  insulin  detemir  and  vice  versa.  No  pharmacokinetic interaction was observed in this study. The study treatments had an additive pharmacodynamic effect. Both treatments and the combination of the treatments were well tolerated.

## 1.2.3. Clinical efficacy

## Study NN2211-1842

Study  NN2211-1842,  performed  in  T2DM  patients,  to  investigate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  adding insulin detemir to the combination therapy liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin, was submitted by the MAH to support this extension of indication. The purpose of the trial was to determine whether the effect of insulin detemir in combination with liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin was superior to that of liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin alone.

## Methods

Study NN2211-1842 was a 26 week randomised, open label, parallel group multicentre, multinational trial,  that  investigated  the  effect  of  insulin  detemir  in  combination  with  liraglutide  and  metformin

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

compared to liraglutide and metformin in subjects with T2DM. The trial included a 26 week extension period; total duration of the trial was 52 weeks.

## Study participants

The study was performed in 202 centers in the following countries: United States (57), Germany (37), United  Kingdom  (32),  France  (19),  Italy  (18),  The  Netherlands  (16),  Spain  (14),  Canada  (7),  and Belgium (2).

Main inclusion criteria:

-  Subjects  diagnosed  with  type  2  diabetes,  insulin  naïve  and  treated  with  metformin  as monotherapy  for ≥ 3  months  prior  to  screening,  at  a  stable  dose  of ≥ 1500  mg/day  or metformin ( ≥ 1500 mg/day) and a sulphonylurea (less than or equal to ½ of the maximum approved  dose  according  to  local  label),  both  at  a  stable  dose  for ≥ 3  months  prior  to screening.  Previous  short  term  insulin  treatment  in  connection  with  inter-current  illness  was allowed, at the discretion of the investigator



-  HbA1c 7.0-10.0% (both inclusive) for subjects on metformin monotherapy, HbA1c 7.0-8.5% (both inclusive) for subjects on metformin in combination with a sulphonylurea
-  Age 18-80 years, both inclusive (or as allowed according to local guidelines)

Inclusion criteria at randomisation:

-  HbA1c measured at the randomisation visit (Visit 4a) greater than or equal to 7.0%

Main exclusion criteria included previous treatment with insulin and glucose-lowering agents other than those stated in the inclusion criteria, impaired liver and renal function, history of pancreatitis, cancer and known history of unstable angina, acute coronary event, other significant cardiac event.

The patients included in the trial were type 2 diabetic patients insufficiently controlled on metformin treatment  and  therefore  in  need  of  intensification of  treatment.  This  approach  is  considered appropriate; metformin is the recommended 1st line therapy according to current treatment guidelines (EASD/ADA). It is noticed however, that patients insufficiently controlled on metformin AND SU were also  included.  This  latter  sub-population  represents  a  switch  design  rather  than  an  add-on  design. Since SU treated subjects were only allowed to be on a dosage corresponding to less than or equal to ½ of the maximum approved dose this may be acceptable.

Patients  with  ischaemic  heart  disease,  heart  failure  NYHA  class  IV,  impaired  hepatic  function  and impaired kidney function were excluded from the trial.

## Treatments

Insulin-naïve  type  2  diabetic  subjects,  aged  18-80,  treated  with  metformin  monotherapy  ( ≥ 1500 mg/day  for ≥ 3  months)  and  HbA1c  between  7.0-10.0%  (both  inclusive);  or  metformin  ( ≥ 1500 mg/day) in combination with a sulphonylurea (less than or equal to ½ of the maximum approved dose) resulting in an HbA1c between 7.0-8.5% (both inclusive) underwent screening, and if eligible, entered the 12 week run-in period. During this run-in period, sulphonylurea (SU) treatment was discontinued, while  treatment  with  metformin  remained  unchanged  (same  dose  and  dosing  regimen).  Treatment with liraglutide was initiated in all patients in 0.6 mg/day weekly increments to allow a final dose of 1.8 mg/day.

Subjects with an HbA1c ≥ 7.0% after the 12-week run-in period were randomised 1:1 to intensification of  treatment  with  open-label  insulin  detemir  (starting  dose  of  10  U)  added  to  the  combination  of liraglutide (1.8 mg/day) and metformin ( ≥ 1500mg/day), or to continue with liraglutide (1.8 mg/day) and metformin ( ≥ 1500mg/day) treatment as control group (see Figure 1). The metformin + liraglutide

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1.8 mg/day + insulin detemir group is referred to as the 'detemir+lira group', while the randomised metformin + liraglutide 1.8 mg/day group is referred to as the 'lira-control group'. The randomisation of subjects to treatment groups was stratified by previous treatment with metformin or a combination of metformin and a SU.

Subjects with an adequate response to liraglutide, i.e. with an HbA1c less than 7.0% after the run-in period, were not randomised, but continued the metformin and liraglutide treatment as in the run-in period.

After the initial dose titration period, liraglutide was to be administered at a constant dose of 1.8 mg throughout the entire trial period. Insulin detemir was initiated at a dose of 10 U per day, with further titration depending on subjects' self-measured glucose values.

After the main  26  week  study,  subjects  could  participate in  the  26  week  extension  study. Intensification of treatment with insulin detemir was allowed for subjects both in the randomised and non-randomised liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin treatment groups with an HbA1c ≥ 8.0% at week 26 and week 38.

## Objectives

The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  and  compare  the  efficacy  (as  assessed  by  HbA1c)  of  insulin detemir in combination with liraglutide and metformin versus liraglutide and metformin in subjects with type 2 diabetes after 26 weeks of randomized treatment

The secondary objectives were to assess and compare the effects of insulin detemir in combination with  liraglutide  and  metformin  versus  liraglutide  and  metformin  on  other  descriptors  of  glycaemic control (FPG, 7-point self-monitored glucose profiles, proportion of subjects reaching target HbA1c), Cpeptide, proinsulin to C-peptide ratio, body weight, waist and hip circumference including the waist to hip ratio, lipids and blood pressure after 26 weeks treatment.

## Safety objectives

To  assess  and  compare  clinical  and  laboratory  safety  parameters  and  incidence  of  hypoglycaemic episodes after 26 weeks of treatment.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary endpoint:

-  Change in HbA1c (%) from baseline (randomisation and Week 0) to Week 26.

## Secondary endpoints:

-  Change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 52 for the two randomised treatment arms using LOCF (applicable for 26-week extension report only)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Proportion  of  subjects  reaching  HbA1c  targets  at  Week  26  (and  Week  52  in  26-week extension); American Diabetes Association (ADA) target &lt;7%; American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) target ≤ 6.5%
-  Change  in  glycaemic  control  parameters  from  baseline  to  Week  26  (and  Week  52  in extension):  Fasting  plasma  glucose  (FPG);  Self-measured  7-point  (meal-related)  glucose profiles,  taken  before  and  90  minutes  after  the  start  of  breakfast,  lunch  and  dinner,  and  at bedtime
-  Change in body weight from baseline to Week 26 (and Week 52 in 26-week extension)
-  Change in waist and hip circumference including waist to hip ratio from baseline to Week 26 (and Week 52 in 26-week extension)
-  Change in beta-cell function from baseline to Week 26 (and Week 52 of 26-week extension): Fasting insulin; Fasting pro-insulin; Fasting C-peptide; Pro-insulin to C-peptide ratio; HOMA-B; HOMA-IR
-  Change in lipid profile (cholesterol, LDL-C, VLDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides and FFA) from baseline to Week 26 (and Week 52 in 26-week extension)
-  Change in blood pressure (diastolic and systolic) from baseline to Week 26 (and Week 52 in 26-week extension)

## Sample size

The trial was powered to demonstrate superiority (delta of 0.5% with a two-sided significance level of 5% and power set to 90%) of insulin detemir + liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin randomised treatment over  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin  randomised  treatment  with  respect  to  change  in  HbA1c  from baseline (i.e. randomisation) to Week 26.

The variation in HbA1c was based on the liraglutide phase 3 trials, i.e. a standard deviation (SD) of approximately 1.2%. When using a 1:1 randomisation, the number of subjects required was 123 per group.

The  sample  size  calculations  were  based  on  the  aim  to  show  superiority  of  metformin  +  liraglutide 1.8mg+insulin detemir vs. metformin + liraglutide 1.8mg for the primary endpoint change in HbA1c (delta of 0.5%, a power of 90% and a standard deviation of 1.2%). The calculations also take into account a high drop-out rate in the run-in- as well as during the first 12 weeks of the treatment period. These  criteria  and  assumptions  are  in  line  with  previous  large  diabetes  trials  and  are  considered acceptable. The high drop-out rates in trials including this patient population are acknowledged.

## Randomisation

Patients  were  randomised  1:1  to  receive  Insulin  detemir  +  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin ≥ 1500 mg/day or liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin ≥ 1500 mg/day

The  randomisation  of  subjects  to  treatment  groups  was  stratified  by  previous  treatment  with metformin or a combination of metformin and a sulphonylurea.

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open-labeled trial design.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical methods

The full analysis set (FAS) was used for analyses of all efficacy endpoints and included all randomised subjects who had been exposed to at least one dose of trial products and who provided post-baseline HbA1c efficacy data.

The non-randomised analysis set included all subjects with an HbA1c &lt;7.0% after 12 weeks of run-in and  with  at  least  one  efficacy  value  after  the  randomisation  visit.  Only  descriptive  statistics  were provided for this group of subjects.

The safety analysis set included all exposed subjects. If a subject received a different treatment than he/she was randomised to, data for the subject was analysed, tabulated and/or listed according to the actual treatment received. All safety evaluations were based on the safety analysis set.

## Primary endpoint:

The primary endpoint was analysed using the full analysis set and an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  26  for  the  randomised  treatment  groups.  Treatment, previous  OAD  and  country  were  explanatory  variables  and  baseline  HbA1c  values  were  included  as covariates. Missing observations were considered missing at random in all analyses.

Missing values at post baseline visits were replaced using last observation carried forward (LOCF) for analysis purposes.

## Secondary endpoints:



FPG, 7-point SMPG profiles, body weight, hip and waist circumference, β -cell function, lipids and blood pressure were all analysed similar to the primary endpoint, i.e. by ANCOVA of change from baseline to week  26  for  the  randomised  treatment  groups  with  treatment,  previous  OAD  and  country  as explanatory variables, and baseline value as covariate. Proportion of subjects reaching target HbA1c &lt; 7%, or ≤ 6.5%; after 26 weeks of treatment was analysed using a logistic regression with treatment, previous OAD and country as fixed effect and baseline HbA1c value as covariate.

The secondary endpoints were supportive evidence to the primary endpoint and all tests were twosided on a significance level of 5%, i.e. no adjustment for multiplicity was applied

## ▪ Results

## Participant flow

A  total  of  1658  subjects  were  screened  for  this  trial  (see  Table  6).  Of  these,  670  subjects  were screening failures, where the majority (72.2%) failed to meet the HbA1c inclusion criterion. The second most  common  reason  for  screening  failure  was  'other',  at  7.8%,  with  most  being  withdrawal  of consent.

The Safety analysis set is based on the actual treatment the subjects received.

★ 39.3e of subjects entering main period were randomised and 6o.7t were non-randomised

A total of 988 subjects entered the run-in phase of the trial and all but one of these subjects were exposed to liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin. One subject withdrew before being exposed to randomised trial products. About 17% (167 of 988) of subjects withdrew early ('early withdrawals'), i.e. during the run-in  period  and  before  randomisation.  The  most  frequent  reasons  for  withdrawal  among  these subjects were adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal adverse events). Protocol deviations and noncompliance  were  also  common  withdrawal  reasons  in  this  group,  including  subjects  discovered  to violate in- and exclusion criteria after trial start.

A  total  of  60.7%  of  the  subjects  (N=498)  completing  the  run-in  phase  with  liraglutide  1.8 mg+metformin,  achieved  adequate  glycaemic  control  and  continued  the  trial  in  the  nonrandomised treatment arm. The remaining 39.3% of subjects who did not achieve adequate glycaemic control with an  HbA1c  below  7%  after  completing  the  run-in  phase,  were  randomised  to  receive  either  insulin detemir+liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin or continued liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin treatment (162 and 161 subjects, respectively).

A total of 25% of subjects withdrew during the entire period of the trial. The differences in withdrawal rates  between  the  two  randomised  treatment  groups  were  driven  by  ineffective  therapy  in  the  liracontrol group. Of the total subject withdrawals, most subjects left the trial during the first 2 months of the run-in phase (22% for both months).

Overall, 75% of subjects completed the 38-week main trial period (run-in and main 26-week treatment period), with 26-week main trial completion rates being 88.9%, 78.9% and 94.4% for subjects in the detemir+lira group, lira-control group, and the non-randomised liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin group, respectively.

For the extension study, 140 subjects (86.4%) in the detemir+lira group, 122 subjects (75.8%) in the lira-control  group  and  461  (92.6%)  in  the  non-randomised  group  continuated  treatment.  Seventeen

(10.6%)  of  the  subjects  in  the  liraglutide-control  group  received  insulin  detemir  intensification treatment, while in the non-randomized liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin group seven (1.4%) subjects received this intensification treatment.

Overall,  68%  of  subjects  completed  the  64-week  total  trial  period  (12-week  run-in,  26-week  main treatment  period  and  26-week  extension  period),  with  completion  rates  being  80.2%,  57.1%  and 85.5% for subjects in the detemir+liraglutide, liraglutide  control  and  the  non-randomised  liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin groups, respectively.

## Recruitment

Study NN2211-1842 was conducted from the 3 rd  of March 2009 until the  19 th of April 2010 (main period of 26 weeks).

## Conduct of the study

Most important substantial protocol amendments:

There were 2 global and 16 local substantial amendments to the final protocol, version 1, dated 30 September 2008.

The  substantial  protocol  amendments  listed  above  are  not  expected  to  have  had  clinically  relevant impact on the overall trial results.

## Baseline data

The  treatment  groups  were  overall  well  matched  with  respect  to  baseline  demographics  and characteristics (see

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 7).  A slightly higher proportion of randomised subjects receiving liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin were Black/African American (10.6%) compared to randomised subjects receiving insulin detemir+liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin (4.9%).

Mean run-in efficacy parameters for subjects previously treated with metformin alone or sulphonylurea and metformin therapy demonstrated comparable results to those presented for all exposed subjects, although  with  generally  lower  means  for  HbA1c  and  FPG  for  subjects  previously  treated  with sulphonylurea and metformin compared to with metformin alone.

The screening physical  examination findings  were comparable  across  treatment  groups  (randomised and non-randomised) and most (about 90%) observations were normal for all organ systems.

Diabetic complications included neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy and macroangiopathy. The most frequent diabetic complications were neuropathy and retinopathy (reported by about 15% and 7% of subjects, respectively),  while  the  overall  prevalence  of  complications  were  comparable  across treatment groups.

Nearly all subjects in all treatment groups reported concomitant illnesses (96.5%). The most frequent concomitant illnesses across treatment groups were disorders in the system organ class metabolism and nutrition disorders and related to hyperlipidaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, obesity and dyslipidaemia. The incidence of these events as well as the other events reported were comparable across treatment groups (both between randomised and for non-randomised).

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary Endpoint - Change in HbA1c

Figure 2 illustrates that the greatest change in HbA1c in all treatment groups was observed during the 12-week  run-in  period;  subjects  in  the  randomised  groups  had  a  mean  screening  HbA1c  of  8.3%, which decreased to 7.6% after the 12-week run-in period. A further significant decrease in HbA1c was observed from baseline to Week 12 for the detemir+lira group, after which HbA1c appeared to remain relatively  stable.  The  estimated  decrease  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  26  was  0.51%  in  the detemir+lira  group,  whereas  a  small  increase  of  0.02%  was  observed  in  the  lira-control  group (comparing Least square means).

Results  from  the  ANCOVA  analysis  demonstrates  that  treatment  with  insulin  detemir+liraglutide  1.8 mg+metformin was superior to treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin alone in terms of change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 (estimated treatment difference of -0.52%) (see Table 9). These results were further supported by a repeated measurements analysis of HbA1c levels after 12 and 26 weeks of randomised treatment.

The mean change in HbA1c from randomisation to Week 52 was also analysed using an ANCOVA model including  values  for  intensified  subjects  in  the  initial  treatment  group  (HbA1c  values  used  after intensification  with  detemir).  In  the  FAS,  using  LOCF,  the  estimated  mean  changes  in  HbA1c  from randomisation  to  Week  52  were  -0.51%  and  -0.10%  in  the  insulin  detemir  +  liraglutide  1.8  mg  + metformin and liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin treatment groups, respectively.

In order to elucidate the impact of the subjects who were exposed during the run-in period to less than 80 days before randomisation, both the summary tables showing the absolute values and changes in HbA1c by week and the planned ANCOVA on HbA1c was made for subjects with at least 80 days of exposure only.  The  mean  changes  over  time  were comparable  to  those  observed  for  the  treatment groups including the entire subject population, as were the ANCOVA estimated means and statistical significance levels. The inclusion of subjects with less than 80 days of exposure to liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin prior to randomisation was therefore considered to have no impact on the overall results. No statistically significant interaction effect between treatment and either baseline HbA1c or baseline FPG was observed.

## Secondary Endpoint - Proportion of Subjects Reaching HbA1c Targets

The proportion of subjects achieving pre-defined HbA1c targets (&lt;7% target; and ≤ 6.5% target) at Week 26 is summarised in Table 10.

The  proportions  of  subjects  achieving  HbA1c  &lt;7%  was  greater  with  insulin  detemir+liraglutide  1.8 mg+metformin compared to liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin alone. The same was true for the number of subjects achieving the HbA1c ≤ 6.5% target.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The proportion of subjects reaching targets was higher with insulin detemir+liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin  treatment  compared  to  liraglutide  1.8  mg+metformin  treatment,  irrespective  of baseline HbA1c level. Furthermore, the lower the baseline HbA1c level, the higher the proportion of subjects reaching targets.

The estimated proportions of subjects achieving HbA1c both &lt;7.0% and ≤ 6.5% at Week 52 were in line with the Week 26 data. A significantly greater proportion of subjects with insulin detemir+liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin treatment achieved these goals (51.9% and 22.4%) compared to  subjects  in  the  control  group  treated  with  liraglutide  1.8  mg+metformin  (21.5%  and  6.8%; including values before intensification as LOCF for intensified subjects) (p&lt;0.0001 for both analyses).

## Body weight

Mean body weight decreased by 3.5 to 4.3 kg during run-in. This weight loss was sustained throughout the  main  treatment  period  for  subjects  randomised  to  further  intensification  with  insulin  detemir (estimated mean change of -0.16 kg), whereas subjects continuing on liraglutide and metformin had a further estimated mean change of -0.95 kg (see Figure 3).

Figure 3: Mean change in body weight from run-in to Week 52 -No imputation - FAS

After  52  weeks,  the  difference  between  groups  became  slightly  greater  with  an  estimated  mean change in body weight of -0.05 kg for the detemir+liraglutide group, versus -1.02 kg in the lira-control group (see Table 12). Table 11 shows the absolute body weight values at baseline, week 26 and end of the study (Week 52) and change in body weight from baseline to Week 26, and to week 52 using the Full  Analysis  Set  without  imputations.  The  mean  body  weight  was  numerically  larger  in  the detemir+lira  group,  in  comparison  with  the  lira-control  group,  95.99  kg  vs  95.32  kg,  although  the median body weight shows the opposite, with values of 91.70 kg vs 93.10 kg, respectively. The SD of both the absolute value, and the difference in body weight from baseline, was rather large in the two treatment  groups.  Changes  in  body  weight  values,  during  this  52-week  study,  were  between decreasing 15.4 kg, and gaining 13.2 kg. These minimum and maximum values were widely spread.

## Other secondary endpoints

Statistically significant improvements were seen in the detemir+lira group, in comparison with the liracontrol group, during the 52 weeks of treatment for the following items:

-  There  was  an  estimated  mean  change  in  FPG  of  -2.12  mmol/L  and  -0.39  mmol/L,  in  the detemir+lira group and lira-control group, respectively (p&lt;0.0001) at Week 26.  At Week 52, the estimated mean change from baseline was -1.91 mmol/l and -0.14 mmol/l respectively, with an estimated treatment difference of (LS mean [95% CI]) -1.77 [-2.24; -1.30] mmol/L.
-  Estimated  mean  decreases  in  post-prandial  glucose  at  all  meal  times  at  Week  52,  (ranging from  -1.14  mmol/L  to  -2.43  mmol/L  and  -0.51  mmol/L  to  -0.96  mmol/L,  for  the  two randomised treatments, respectively).
-  Proportion of subjects (about 10% more) having post-prandial glucose measurements below 10  mmol/L  at  each  meal  at  Week  26.  At  Week  52,  only  breakfast  post-prandial  glucose measurements showed a statistically significant difference between treatment groups. Although

Detemir + Lira

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

no statistically significant treatment difference was observed for prandial glucose increments at either breakfast, lunch or dinner at either Week 26 or Week 52.

-  A small, but greater number, difference for change in free fatty acids was seen at Week 26, estimated  change  of  -0.11  mmol/L  and  -0.03  mmol/L  (p=0.0017).  However,  no  statistically significant difference was observed at Week 52.
-  From randomisation to Week 52, there was a small statistically significant treatment difference for change in HDL-cholesterol in favour of detemir+lira group, with increases observed for both treatment groups (including values before intensification as LOCF for intensified subjects).
-  At week 26, a greater proportion of subjects reaching the composite endpoint of HbA1c &lt;7%, systolic  blood  pressure  &lt;130  mmHg  and  change  in  body  weight ≤ 0kg,  10.5%  and  4.1%, respectively (p=0.0126). Data at Week 52 were not provided by the MAH.
-  At Week 26, a greater proportion of subjects reached the composite endpoint of HbA1c &lt;7%, change  in  body  weight ≤ 0kg  and  no  major  or  minor  hypoglycaemic  episodes:  21.7%  and 8.9%, respectively (p=0.0012). At Week 52, the proportions of subjects were 25.9% versus 16.8%.  This  difference  between  groups  was  at  the  end  of  the  study  no  longer  statistically significant (p=0.06).

No  statistically  significant  differences  were  seen  between  the  two  treatment  groups  in  fasting  lipid profiles or blood pressure at Week 26 or Week 52.

Data  on  fasting  insulin  and  hence  HOMA-B  and  HOMA-IR  could  not  be  obtained  for  the  insulin detemir+liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin treated subjects due to cross-reactivity between insulin detemir and  the  insulin  assay.  Therefore,  an  overall  effect  of  treatments  on  beta-cell  function  could  not  be established.  Both  pro-insulin  and  C-peptide  levels  decreased  over  time,  where  the  decreases  were statistically significantly greater for subjects in the detemir+lira group compared to subjects in the liracontrol group (P=0.0230 and p&lt;0.0001, respectively). Both mean baseline pro-insulin and baseline Cpeptide values were slightly higher for subjects in the detemir+lira group. No treatment difference was observed for pro-insulin to C-peptide ratio.

## 1.2.4. Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and metaanalysis)

To provide data on efficacy and safety of insulin detemir + metformin, the MAH submitted data from literature. Three sources were used:

## Literature search

- -An  International Variability  Evaluation  (PREDICTIVE)  search  (PREDICTIVE™  is  a  global observational study including 30 countries following type 1 and type 2 DM patients initiated on Levemir. The primary objective of the study is to document the safety of using Levemir)
- -All  available  Levemir  clinical  trials  were  used  to  identify  patients  with  comparable  patient populations.
- -The MAH identified comparable patient populations in the above mentioned studies/literature to provide data on efficacy and safety of the basal insulin and metformin combination.

Results from these searches are shown in Table 13.

The literature search provided two articles: Meneghimi et al. and Selam et al. Both articles described the  PREDICTIVE  study.  This  PREDICTIVE  303  Trial  included  5604  DM  type  2  patients  with  HbA1c ≤ 12%. Age (58.6 years), weight (97.8 kg) and diabetes duration (11.4 years) were comparable with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study  NN2211-1842,  but  HbA1c  levels  and  previous  diabetes  treatment  were  different  from  study NN2211-1842.

HbA1c levels in the PREDICTIVE study were up to 12% without cut off point for minimum value. A third of the population (30.6%) had an HbA1c level &gt;9.0%; and there was a group of patients (13.3%) with a baseline HbA1c level below 7%. The pre-treatment in this population included all possible varieties. A third of the patients (32%) used OADs only, while a large group (43%) was on insulin at baseline, and a small fraction (2.3%) did not receive any treatment at baseline (ref.: Meneghini et al).

A post hoc sub-analysis was performed in 1806 insulin-naïve patients participating in the PREDICTIVE study by Selam et al. On average patients were taking two OADs. Metformin was most commonly used (72%), followed by SU (70%) and TZD (55%). A third (33.4) of these subjects had an HbA1c above 9%, and a group of 10.9% had an HbA1c &lt;7%. The subjects participating in this PREDICTIVE trial were not on insulin detemir in combination with metformin.

The MAH selected 238 patients from the PREDICTIVE study who were on insulin detemir + metformin during the trial. Again, the age (58.5 years), weight (93.5 kg) and diabetes duration (10.3 years) were comparable with study NN2211-1842. However the mean baseline HbA1c, 8.85%, and the previous treatment were different from study NN2211-1842. A large proportion (60.50%) of the subjects was on metformin only, while 19.75% used the combination of metformin+SU (dosage not known). Eight subjects (3.4%) did not receive any treatment at baseline. About a third of this population used other forms of OAD medication, including triple therapy. Insulin dosage at baseline was 0.32U/kg, in contrast to study NN2211-1842 where only insulin naïve patients participated.

Furthermore,  the  MAH  gathered  76  subjects  on  detemir  +  metformin  treatment  from  three  pooled Levemir Trials. These patients had a higher mean HbA1c at baseline (8.72%), body weight was slightly lower (91.55 kg), while the previous diabetes treatment was not mentioned. During the trials, change in  HbA1c  was  -1.88%  and  mean  body  weight  increased  with  0.74kg.  Hypoglycaemic  episodes  were found in eight (10.5%) patients, with in total 20 events.

The  MAH  stated  that  all  the  data  presented  for  subjects  treated  with  basal  insulin  +  metformin illustrate  that  the  change  in  HbA1c  observed  in  these  populations  was  associated  with  a  net  weight gain  and  a  higher  incidence  of  hypoglycaemic  episodes  compared  to  what  was  observed  in  study NN2211-1842. Finally,  there  was  a  general  need  for  higher  doses  of  insulin  (0.41U/kg  versus  0.68 U/kg),  i.e.  up  to  40%  more  per  kg  body  weight  compared  to  both  Meneghini  et  al  and  the  pooled Levemir trials to achieve a clinically relevant reduction in HbA1c, compared to that used by subjects receiving insulin detemir + liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin in the study.

Therefore, these data support the efficacious combination of basal insulin, liraglutide and metformin, where liraglutide contributes to the efficacy with less basal insulin required (units/kg), a net weight loss or weight neutrality and a lower incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes.

## 1.2.5. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The MAH claimed an extension of the indication for Victoza in the treatment of T2DM in combination with basal insulin in patients not achieving glycaemic control with Victoza and metformin alone. This was not considered as acceptable by the CHMP, as this would be more an indication for insulin detemir. For  an  indication  for  Victoza,  it  should  be  demonstrated  that  liraglutide  has  a  value  in  efficacy  and safety  when  added  to  insulin.  The  design  of  study  NN2211-1842  only  gives  information  about  the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir when added to metformin + liraglutide. The design does not allow for a conclusion about the added value of liraglutide in this combination. In the study design, an extra treatment arm with the treatment combination of insulin detemir + metformin is missing. The MAH submitted a total of two trials, a pooled trial and a data set with type 2 diabetes patients using the combination of detemir insulin plus metformin. The idea behind this comparison with subjects included in  study  NN2211-1842  was  to  create  an  imaginary  treatment  arm  in  this  study.  In  this  way, assessment  of  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  liraglutide  itself  in  the  treatment  combination  with  insulin detemir  might  be  possible.  However,  the  study  populations  are  different  in  terms  of  pre-existing

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

metabolic control, severity of diabetes, and pre-study medication. Therefore, this additional data is not really helpful in the assessment  of  the  efficacy of liraglutide in  the  combination  treatment. Nevertheless,  the  CHMP  considered  it  important  for  the  prescribing  physicians  to  have  access  to information reflecting the trial results in the Victoza SmPC in section 5.1.

In the randomised groups, addition of insulin detemir on top of the combination therapy metformin + liraglutide showed a clinically relevant estimated mean change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 of 0.51%  in  this  study.  Mean  change  (SD)  of  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  26  without  imputations resulted  in  -0.04%  (0.68),  vs  -0.51%  (0.75),  for  lira-control  group  vs.  the  detemir+lira  group,  a difference of -0.47%. This is comparable to the difference measured with LOCF.

on study were in 52 Week data were provided by the MAH. The efficacy data of this 26-Week extensi line with the main 26-Week efficacy data. The effect on HbA1c was sustained. As expected, a larger proportion  of  subjects  in  the  detemir+lira  group  achieved  HbA1c  goals  of  &lt;7%  and ≤ 6.5%,  in comparison with the lira-control group. This difference was clinically relevant.

ween groups Body weight dropped in both treatment groups, with statistically significant difference bet in  favour of the lira-control group, indicating less reduction in body weight when insulin is added to liraglutide.  The  reduction  in  body  weight,  between  baseline  (Week  0),  Week  26  and  Week  52,  was however small, and the SD is quite large.

completed the study: 57.1%, versus 80.2% in the Lower number of patients in the lira-control group detemir+lira group. Half of the withdrawals in the randomised liraglutide+metformin arm were due to withdrawal criteria (pregnancy; confirmed fasting plasma glucose exceeding 11.1mmol/l (200 mg/dL) after  randomisation;  suspicion  of  acute  pancreatitis.  Though  a  higher  number  of  withdrawals  in  the randomised liraglutide+metformin arm based on poor glycaemic control would have been expected, no details  have  been  provided  regarding  the  distribution  of  withdrawal  criteria.  Data  was  provided regarding the withdrawals from all treatment groups. The number of withdrawals by reason and by week  since  randomisation  did  not  signal  a  specific  pattern  in  between  the  three  treatment  groups. Neither did the graphical presentations by withdrawal reason and by week since randomisation cause any concerns.

stically significant differences in systolic or diastolic blood pressure between the two There were no stati randomised treatment arms seen from randomisation to end of study. The MAH demonstrated that the reduction of systolic blood pressure seen in the original dossier of liraglutide was in line with the results from study NN2211-1842 when the run-in (start liraglutide) was taken into account. In study NN11221842, systolic blood pressure reductions were between 1.6 and 6.3 mmHg from run-in to 52 weeks treatment. In the interim 6-months data, blood pressure lowering effects of liraglutide between  2.3 and 6.7 mmHg were observed. However, the systolic blood pressure reduction was numerically larger in  patients  treated  with  liraglutide  +  metformin  compared  to  patients  treated  with  liraglutide  + metformin + insulin detemir.

re in the original dossier, liraglutide decreased the systolic blood numerically higher than that observed for the detemir+lira group. According to the data on blood pressu pressure  on  average  of  2.3  to  6.7  mmHg  from  baseline  and  compared  to  active  comparator  the decrease was 1.9 to 4.5 mmHg over the duration of studies. This effect is in contrast to the results obtained in study NN2211-1842; though a decrease of 1.34 mmHg was observed from run-in to end of treatment  (completers)  for  non-randomised  subjects.  An  increase  in  systolic  blood  pressure  was observed  for  the  same  period  for  the  randomised  lira-control  group,  an  increase  that  was  in  fact

Furthermore, metformin treatment was not provided by the sponsor. It was confirmed that appropriate actions were taken during the study to ensure compliance to metformin treatment. The mean dose of metformin was comparable between groups (2045.3 mg in the lira-control group, versus 2129.8 mg in the detemir+lira group).

## 1.2.6. Conclusions on clinical efficacy

This effect was further supported by a statistically significantly higher number of subjects reaching the predefined HbA1c targets of &lt; 7.0% and 6.5% respectively. However study NN2211-1842 was designed  to  determine  the  efficacy  of  adding  insulin  determir  to  the  therapy  of  T2DM  patients whose glucose levels are not sufficiently controlled on the combination treatment of liraglutide 1.8 mg and  metformin.  The  impact  of  liraglutide  in  this  triple  combination  is  not  known  and  therefore  the benefit of Victoza in this triple combination has not been demonstrated.

For  the  two randomised treatment groups, mean duration of liraglutide treatment was slightly longer (42 days) in subjects in the detemir+lira group (411 days) versus that for subjects in the lira-control group (369 days), as also reflected in the greater total subject exposure time. Mean duration of insulin detemir treatment  was  about  326  days  with  a  total  subject  exposure  time  of  145  years  for  subjects  in  the detemir+lira group.

For subjects randomised to insulin detemir+liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin, insulin detemir was initiated at  a  dose  of  10  U,  with  further  titration  at  visits  depending  on  the  subjects'  self-measured  plasma glucose levels. The mean prescribed dose was 0.41 U/kg and 0.45 U/kg for these subjects at Week 26 and Week 52 respectively.

## Adverse events

A  summary  of  adverse  events  by  treatment  is  presented  in  Table  15.  The  proportion  of  subjects reporting adverse events was comparable between the two randomised treatment groups and also for the  non-randomised  treatment  group.  The  incidence  of  adverse  events  with  probable,  possible  or unlikely relation to treatment was comparable across the two randomised treatment groups and the non-randomised treatment group, as were the incidences of mild, moderate and severe events. The majority of adverse events was mild in severity and thought to be unlikely related to trial products.

&amp;:Proportion of subjects in analysis set having adverse event

N: Number of subjects with adverse event

The most commonly reported adverse events in all treatment groups and for the entire trial period was nasopharyngitis  within  the  system  organ  class  infections  and  infestations:  20%,  25%  and  14%  of subjects  in  the  detemir+liraglutide,  liraglutide-control  and  the  non-randomised  treatment  groups, respectively (see  Table  16).  Gastrointestinal  disorders,  mostly  nausea,  diarrhoea  and  vomiting  were also common in all treatment groups. Increased lipase was reported by a higher proportion of subjects in the detemir+lira group versus both the randomised and non-randomised liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin  groups  (16.0%  versus  10.1%  and  11.0%).  Generally,  the  proportion  of  subjects reporting adverse events was comparable across the two randomised treatment groups and the nonrandomised treatment group.

During  the  extension  phase  of  study  NN2211-1842,  seven  (7)  cases  (4.3%)  of  neoplasms  were identified  in  the  detemir+lira  group,  while  one  (1)  was  reported  in  the  liraglutide-control  group  and twelve  (12)  neoplasms  (2.4%)  in  the  non-randomised  liraglutide  +  metformin  group.  There  was  no apparent clustering in the types of neoplasm seen in the detemir+lira group.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

There were no deaths reported during the main period of the trial. However, two deaths were reported during the 26-week extension trial, both within the system organ class neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified, and both were rated as unlikely to be related to treatment. One death was due to pulmonary  mass  and  metastases  to  the  central  nervous  system  (randomised  liraglutide  1.8  mg  + metformin) and the other death was due to gallbladder cancer and metastases to liver (nonrandomised liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin).

The  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  serious  adverse  events  during  the  52-Week  trial  was  overall comparable across treatment groups (10.4%, 6.9% and 12.4% for subjects in the detemir+liraglutide group,  liraglutide-control  group  and  non-randomised  liraglutide  1.8  mg+metformin,  respectively  see Table  17).  A  total  of  123  serious  adverse  events  were  reported  by  97  subjects  (including  'early withdrawals') in the entire trial period. For all treatments, most events were unlikely related to trial products and severe in nature. No pattern or clustering of events was observed during the main period of the trial (week 0-26), with most events being reported by single subjects only and spread across several  system  organ  classes.  During  the  26-week  extension  period,  the  most  frequently  reported adverse  events  were  within  the  system  organ  class  neoplasms,  benign,  malignant  and  unspecified (including cysts and polyps). These were reported by 4 subjects (2.5%) in the detemir+lira group and 3 subjects (0.6%) in the non-randomised liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin treatment group (see below under ' Neoplasm related adverse events' ).

## Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal of Subjects

In total, 127 out of 987 subjects (12.9%) exposed to liraglutide withdrew or were withdrawn from the trial  due  to  adverse  events.  A  total  of  92  subjects  withdrew  before  the  randomisation  visit  ('early withdrawals'), while 7 subjects (4.3%) of the detemir+liraglutide, 9 subjects (5.6%) of the liraglutidecontrol group, and 19 subjects (3.8%) in the non-randomised group withdrew after randomisation. No treatment difference or clustering in type of adverse event withdrawals were observed. The reasons for withdrawing for the seven subjects out of the detemir+lira group were (all items were mentioned for one  subject  only):  increased  lipase;  increased  pancreatic  enzymes;  abdominal  pain  with  diarrhoea; gastric carcinoma; convulsion; renal failure; and bronchopulmonary disease.

## Hypoglycaemia

One (1)  subject  experienced  24  episodes  of  minor  and  symptoms-only  hypoglycaemia;  this  subject was identified as an outlier prior to database lock for the 26-week main period of the trial and was excluded from the analyses.

The rate of minor and symptomatic only hypoglycaemic episodes reported during the main and the extension period was compared for the two randomised treatment groups in Table 18. Overall, the rate of  minor  hypoglycaemic  episodes  was  low  across  all  treatment  groups,  at  0.228,  0.034  and  0.115 events  per  subject  year  for  the  detemir+liraglutide,  liraglutide-control  and  the  non-randomised liraglutide  group,  respectively.  A  similar  pattern  was  evident  for  'symptoms  only'  hypoglycaemic episodes,  with  the  highest  rate  being  reported  for  subjects  in  the  detemir+liraglutide  group  (0.394 events per subject year), followed by subjects in the liraglutide-control (0.119) and non-randomised (0.091) treatment groups.

The rate of both all episodes and minor hypoglycaemic episodes was significantly higher in the insulin detemir  +  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin  treated  subjects  compared  to  the  liraglutide  1.8  mg  + metformin treated  subjects  (p=0.0012  and  p=0.0011,  respectively).  When  including  this  outlier,  no statistically significant treatment differences were observed. The number of subjects reporting both all hypoglycaemic  episodes  and  minor  episodes  was  significantly  higher  in  the  detemir+lira  group compared to the lira-control group (p=0.0009 and p=0.0017, respectively). No statistically significant treatment  difference  was  observed  for  the  number  of  subjects  reporting  hypoglycaemic  episodes classified as symptoms only.

* One subject, a 57-year-old female, reporting 24 minor and symptoms only hypoglycaemic episodes was identified as an outlier prior to database lock for the 26-week main period of the trial. The first episode  was  reported  prior  to  trial  drug  start  during  the  screening  phase  (symptoms  only,  blood glucose 3.3 mmol/L). The next event occurred after 16 days of liraglutide and metformin treatment. The subject had a history of hypoglycaemia since 2007, which was specified as ongoing at the time of screening. When including this outlier, no statistically significant treatment differences were observed.

## Neoplasm related adverse events

A summary of neoplasm adverse events reported during the 12-week run-in, 26-week main trial and 26-week extension period is presented in Table 19. Twenty-one (21) neoplasm adverse events were reported by 20 subjects. The number of events was small and most events were reported by single subjects  only.  No  clustering  in  the  types  of  neoplasms  reported  was  observed.  Of  the  21  events reported,  11  were  serious  and  3  led  to  trial  product  withdrawal.  Eleven  (11)  of  the  subjects  fully recovered or were recovering at time of reporting.

Following  the  reporting  of  7  cases  of  neoplasms  in  the  triple  combination  arm  (insulin  detemir  + liraglutide + metformin) during the extension phase of study NN2211-1842, the MAH was requested by the  CHMP  to  justify  that  that  the  triple  combination  can  be  used  safely  and  to  discuss  possible mechanisms and ways to further elucidate this concern. To address this concern the MAH provided the following:

-  An  exploration  of  study  NN2211-1842  data-set  for  any  indication  of  a  tumour  growth promoting effects in the triple combination arm by considering all treatment emergent AEs.
-  All  narratives  and  additional  clinical  information  as  well  as  follow-up  information  to  enable  a comprehensive overview of the potential additional risk factors identified for each event. For all the malignant neoplasms, further evaluation of confounding risk factors was done.
-  A  statistical  (post-hoc)  analysis  of  the  neoplasm  events  (total  and  malignant  cases  alone) including  several  sensitivity  analyses  for  evaluation  of  statistical  differences  between  the treatment groups.
-  In a separate statistical sub-analysis, the NN2211-1842 data have been investigated for any significant  difference  between the two treatments (insulin detemir + liraglutide + metformin and liraglutide  +  metformin) in  the  development of a new neoplasm among subjects with a previous  event  of  neoplasms  according  to  their  medical  history.  This  was  done  in  order  to further  disclose  any  potential  tumour  growth  promoting  effect  of  the  triple  combination therapy.
-  Based on non-clinical and clinical data, discussion on any possible mechanisms for tumourgenicity  and  a  tumour  growth  promoting  effect  of  insulin  and  liraglutide,  both individually and combined
-  Potential actions to further elucidate and ensure ongoing surveillance regarding this concern.

The MAH provided extensive narrative information. There were 6 patients with malignant neoplasms in the triple combination arm, of which one, however, had a wrong date of onset (event occurred before administration  of  insulin  detemir)  which  leaves  5  patients  with  malignant  event.  In  the  randomised lira+met arm there was 1 patient with a malignant neoplasm and in the non-randomised lira+met arm arm  there  were  5  malignant  events  in  4  patients.  The  proportion  of  malignant  events  was  thus distinctly higher in the triple combination arm (5/163; 3.1%) compared to the randomised control arm (1/159;  0.6%)  or  compared  to  the  pooled  lira+met  arms  (5/658;  0.8%).  The  MAH  stated  that  the larger  drop-out  rate  in  the  randomised  and  non-randomised  control  group  accounted  for  relatively higher numbers of neoplasms in the triple therapy group. Taking these withdrawals into account, the proportion of malignant neoplasms would be 3.85% (5/[162-32]) in the insulin detemir + liraglutide + metformin  group,  compared  to  0.79%  (1/[161-53])  in  the  randomised  control  group,  and  0.74% (4/[(161-53)+(498-66)])  in  the  pooled  liraglutide  +  metformin  group.  In  conclusion,  even  after correction  of  withdrawal  rates  and  removing  the  patient  who  developed  malignant  neoplasm  before starting  the  triple  therapy,  there  is  a  higher  proportion  of  malignant  cases  in  the  insulin  detemir  + liraglutide + metformin group compared to the control groups in study NN 2211-1842.

No contributing risk factors could be identified for the malignancy in the randomised liraglutide+metformin arm. Among the 4 subjects with malignant events in the non-randomised arm the MA identified 2 patients with potentially contributing/risk factors.

The majority of the malignant cases was confounded by strong risk factors and contributing factors for cancer and that there were few'un-explained' malignant neoplasms. However, an alternative explanation could still be the promotion of the malignant tumours by the detemir/liraglutide treatment in patients with risk factors. This can not be rule out at the moment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

None  of  the  conducted  post-hoc  statistical  analyses  supported  the  concern  regarding  a  growth promoting effect  of  the  triple  combination  treatment.  However,  the  most  important  test  showed  an estimated OR for reporting a malignant neoplasm related TEAE between the two randomised treatment arms of 5.0 with a 95% CI [0.58; 43.28], without taking the falsely included malignant case in the triple  group  into  account.  Since  the  CI  contained  the  '1',  no  statistically  significant  difference  was shown, but numbers are too low for any statistical conclusions.

The  growth  promoting  effect  was  also  not  suggested  by  the  non-clinical  data.  Long-term carcinogenicity studies with metformin have been performed in rats ( ≤ 900 mg/kg/day for 104 weeks) and in mice ( ≤ 1500 mg/kg/day for 91 weeks). No evidence of carcinogenicity was found in male or female mice or in male rats.

Standard  carcinogenicity  studies  were  not  performed  with  insulin  detemir.  Insulin  detemir  has  a slightly  lower  affinity  than  insulin  itself  for  the  insulin  receptors  (IR-A  and  IR-B)  and  the  insulin-like Growth  Factor-1  (IGF-1)  receptor.  Especially  the  IGF-1  receptor  has  been  linked  to  the  mitogenic effects of insulin and insulin analogues (Kazda et al., 2010). Insulin detemir has also been tested for mitogenic potency in vitro by the MAH (data are only submitted as preliminary data in the response document) and others (Weinstein et al., 2009). While Weinstein et al. (2009) showed slightly higher potencies  of  insulin  detemir  as  compared  to  insulin  in  several  cell  lines  (HCT-116,  PC-3  and  MCF-7 cancer cells), the MAH only observed lower potencies of insulin detemir as compared to insulin in a similar (MCF-7) and several different cell lines (Colo205, L6hIR and HMEC). The MAH is requested to submit the final study report has not been submitted. Following up to 26 weeks of treatment, insulin detemir was found to stimulate rat mammary gland cell proliferation in  vivo to  the  same  extent  as human insulin. Hence, the available in vitro and in vivo non-clinical data suggest that the mitogenic potential of levemir is similar to that of native human insulin.

In carcinogenicity studies conducted with liraglutide, C-cell tumours were observed in mice and rats. A NOAEL value for these findings was established in mice at 0.2 mg liraglutide/kg/day, which results in plasma exposure levels similar to what is obtained in the clinic. A NOAEL value was not established in rats. A number of exploratory studies have been conducted in order to evaluate the mechanism behind carcinogenic effect of liraglutide on rodent C-cells. The relevance for humans is likely to be low but cannot  be  completely  excluded.  Other  types  of  tumours  were  also  observed  in  the  carcinogenicity studies  especially  in  female  animals.  However,  the  relevance  of  these  tumour  findings  for  human safety  was  considered  limited  to  due  the  lack  of  an  apparent  dose-response  relationship,  sufficient safety  margins  and/or  the  experimental  conditions.  Both  insulin  and  GLP-1  receptors  are  known  to cause  cell  proliferation  upon  stimulation.  Based  on  the  current  understanding  of  the  molecular mechanisms  of  insulin  and  GLP-1  action,  these  hormones  and  their  analogues  activate  different intracellular  signalling  pathways.  Additive  and  synergic  interactions  are  therefore  not  considered unlikely. However, the proliferative effects of these pathways seem to be limited to specific types of cells. Hence, insulin and GLP-1 including their analogues are unlikely to be general growth promoters.

Both insulin and GLP-1 receptors are known to cause cell proliferation upon stimulation.

Additive and synergic interactions are therefore not considered unlikely. However, the proliferative effects of these pathways seem to be limited to specific types of cells. Hence, insulin and GLP-1 including their analogues are unlikely to be general growth promoters. On the contrary, it is expected that a potential proliferative response due to combination treatments with liraglutide and insulin detemir would depend on the responsiveness of the different  cell  types  to  both  pathways.  The  present  data  indicate  a  clear  distinction  in  the  cell  types responsive  to  either  insulin  or  GLP-1  receptor  activation  in  terms  of  cell  proliferation  and  tumour formation. Furthermore, the MAH has studied the combined effect of insulin detemir and liraglutide on cell  growth  in  a  colon  cancer  cell  line  (only  preliminary  data  were  submitted  by  the  MAH).  These

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

preliminary data showed that increasing concentrations of liraglutide had no apparent influence on the concentration-response relationship of insulin detemir.

Overall,  the  weight  of  evidence  for  an  additive  or  synergic  tumour  promotion  due  to  combination treatments with metformin, insulin detemir and liraglutide is currently considered sparse from a nonclinical perspective and the potential risk is presently only theoretical.

Regarding the clinical data, MAH referred to the well-known association of type 2 diabetes and obesity with certain types of cancer. However, there are controversial publications from several predominantly epidemiological  studies  on  the  association  between  insulin,  in  particular  insulin  glargin,  and  cancer (Yang, Diabetes 2010, Hemkens, Diabetologia 2009, Jonasson, Diabetologia 2009, Colhoun, Diabetologia  2009,  Rosenstock,  Diabetologia  2009).  The  MAH  also  referred  to  an  individual  patient data meta-analysis of randomised  trials  sponsored  by  the  MAH  in  8693  patients  (Dejgaard, Diabetologia  2009)  where  patients  with  insulin  detemir  had  a  lower  or  similar  occurrence  of  cancer compared  to  patients  treated  with  NPH  insulin  or  insulin  glargine,  respectively.  However,  the  trials were of limited duration, without post trial follow-up and not designed to assess the risk of cancer.

Accordingly, it is self-evident that final conclusions on a potential risk of detemir and liraglutide cannot be drawn from study NN2211-1842.

According to the CHMP, the signal of a tumour promoting risk is not as strong as to advice against updating  the  Victoza  SmPC  with  the  results  of  study  NN2211-1842.  It  is,  however,  considered  to important to follow up on this potential concern.

Without  large  randomised  long  term  studies  with  cancer  endpoints  the  issue  of  a  potential  growth promoting effect of the combination of insulin detemir and liraglutide cannot be answered. Based on the  overall  evidence  currently  available,  however,  the  signal  of  a  potential  tumour  promoting  effect seems not as strong as to advise against the use of this combination treatment. In this respect the devastating effects of insufficiently  controlled  diabetes  should also  be  weighed  against this  potential risk.  The  Pharmacovigilance  measures  proposed  by  the  MAH  are  supported  by  the  CHMP,  and  have been implemented in the RMP.

## Pancreas related adverse events

Pancreas related adverse events were to be reported as MESIs to establish if there were indications of pancreatitis.  The  pancreas  related  adverse  events  reported  during  both  run-in,  main  and  extension period are presented in Table 20. The overall proportion of subjects reporting pancreas related adverse events was higher for the detemir+lira group compared to the lira-control group and non-randomised liraglutide group, 11.0% vs. 8.8% and 7.8%, respectively.

The  most  commonly  reported  pancreas  related  adverse  events  were  increased  lipase,  reported  by similar  proportions  of  subjects  within  treatment  groups  and  at  9.8%,  7.5%  and  7.4%  of  subjects treated  with  insulin  detemir  +  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin,  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin  and nonrandomised liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin, respectively.

Four (4) cases of pancreatitis were reported by four subjects during the trial period. One subject with acute  pancreatitis  withdrew  early.  One  (1)  case  of  acute  pancreatitis  and  one  (1)  case  of  chronic pancreatitis were diagnosed in the lira-control group, whereas one case of unspecified pancreatitis was diagnosed in the non-randomised liraglutide group.

## Thyroid related adverse events

The overall proportion of subjects reporting thyroid related adverse events was 1.2%, 2.5% and 4.2% of subjects reporting an event in the detemir+lira group, lira-control group and the non-randomised liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin treatment group, respectively. The most frequently reported thyroid related adverse event in all treatment groups was increased calcitonin, which was reported by single or few subjects in each treatment group. For the entire trial period, including follow-up information on adverse events reported in the 26-week main trial period, 3 thyroid neoplasms were reported (all in the non-randomised liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin treatment group). No malignancy was suspected in any of these cases.

## Cardiovascular safety

In  line  with  previous  experience  from  liraglutide  trials  and  as  reported  in  the  original  MAA,  a  slight increase  in  pulse  was  observed  across  treatment  groups  in  all  treatment  groups  during  the  run-in period. There was no difference seen between treatment groups.

## Laboratory findings

The  most  common  clinical  laboratory  adverse  event  in  all  treatment  groups  were  increased  lipase, reported by 16.0%, 10.1% and 11.0% for subjects in the detemir+lira group, lira-control group and the non-randomised liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin group, respectively. Fluctuations in lipase values over time were observed for all subjects, with no apparent or consistent trends. A total of 124 subjects reported lipase values above 2x UNR in the main period of the trial (15.1%). Of these, 23 subjects had lipase values above 2x UNR at run-in. The increase in lipase did not appear to be associated with an increased reporting of gastrointestinal adverse events. One of the clinical laboratory adverse events was serious: increased lipase, reported by a subject treated with liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin, and classified as severe. The subject recovered, without change in dose. It was clarified by the MAH that this  difference  in  increased  lipase  was  evident  also  before  patients  were  randomised  to  study treatment. Serum lipase did not seem to increase over time in any of the treatment groups and most importantly,  in  study  NN2211-1842  elevated  serum  lipase  was  not  associated  with  increases  in amylase or the observed events of pancreatitis.

Overall, the clinical laboratory evaluations observed in the trial are in line with those reported in the original MAA.

## Immunological events

Between  Week  0  (randomisation)  and  Weeks  52  and  53,  only  single  subjects  tested  positive  for liraglutide  antibodies.  No  treatment  group  difference  in  terms  of  numbers  of  subjects  being  positive over time was apparent. At Week 53, where only subjects who were off drug between Weeks 52 and 53 were included, 4 (3.7%), 2 (2.1%) and 15 (4.0%) subjects were positive for liraglutide antibodies in  the  insulin  detemir  +  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin,  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin  and  nonrandomised  liraglutide  1.8  mg  +  metformin  treatment  groups,  respectively.  All  but  one  of  these subjects had antibodies exhibiting cross-reactivity, whereas 7 subjects had antibodies demonstrating neutralising effects (1 subject treated with insulin detemir and 6 subjects treated with non-randomised liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin).

Overall, levels of antibodies specific to insulin detemir remained low during the trial (mean 1.68 %B/T at Week 0 and mean 4.30 %B/T at Week 53 for subjects off drug between Weeks 52 and 53). A slight increase was observed from Week 0 (randomisation) to Week 53 (subjects off drug between Weeks 52 and 53) in antibodies with cross-reacting effect (mean -0.08 %B/T at Week 0 and mean 11.74 %B/T at Week 53).

## Post-marketing reports of ketoacidosis

Since the PSUR submission in August 2010, a few spontaneous case reports of diabetic ketoacidosis, due to switch from insulin to Victoza in insulin dependent patients, were identified during routine safety surveillance of Victoza. Following the Japanese launch of Victoza, a cluster of cases was identified in Japan. Two of the cases had a fatal outcome. The product label in Japan was updated immediately following these incidences. The MAH proposed to update the Victoza SmPC to ensure correct use of the product and to prevent this inappropriate and off-label use.

A  total  of  334  cases  of  hyperglycaemia  have  been  reported  by  the  MAH.  Of  these  cases,  26  were reported  as  serious  adverse  events  and  308  as  non-serious  adverse  events.  Information  on  either current concomitant use of insulin (n=37/334) or switch from insulin (n=28/334) was available in 65 cases (50 non-serious cases; 15 serious cases).

From the total of 26 serious cases, 2 cases were confirmed type 1 diabetes mellitus patients (cases 292059; 312067). A total of 16 cases were reported as type 2 diabetes mellitus. From these cases, cases 309592 and 314183 were later suspected of having type 1 diabetes mellitus and case 314183 also was reported as having a positive anti-GAD antibody test; case 306877 was later diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.

A  total  of  8  cases  were  reported  as  either  'drug  used  for  unknown  indication'  or  'diabetes  mellitus' without specification of subtype of disease. Among the 308 cases reported as non-serious, information on insulin treatment was available in 50 cases; 15 cases had information confirming a switch from an insulin-containing regimen, 35 cases had information confirming concomitant use of insulin.

It is not unusual for diabetic patients to experience bouts of hyperglycaemia even when they are on adequate  therapy  as  glycaemic  control  depends  on  several  factors  apart  from  the  therapy.  This  is acceptable  as  long  as  the  hyperglycaemic  episodes  are  transient  and  not  serious.  The  non  serious cases belong to that category.

In  the  complete  data  set  of  334  hyperglycaemia  cases,  information  confirming  a  switch  from  an insulin-containing regimen was available in 28/333 (8.4%). There was no pattern in the type of insulincontaining  regimen  to  be  switched  from,  as  both  basal-bolus  regimens  and  premix  regimens  were reported.  Of  the  10  cases  reported  as  diabetic  ketoacidosis  or  ketoacidosis,  9  occurred  after discontinuation of an insulin-containing regimen.

Duration of treatment of Victoza in the 26 serious cases ranged from 1 day to 175 days with a median of 16.5 days.

Upon identification of the Japanese cases, the MAH initiated actions to ensure appropriate use of the product.  These  actions  are  all  described  in  the  revised  Risk  Management  Plan  submitted  with  this application (please refer to the RMP section below).

Based on the described cases of hyperglycaemia the MAH proposed to amend section 4.4 of the SmPC and section 2 of the Package Leaflet (refer to section Changes to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package below).

## 1.2.8. Discussion on clinical safety

In study NN2211-1842, the mean duration of liraglutide treatment was 411 days for subjects in the detemir+lira group and 369 days for subjects in the lira-control group. The mean duration of insulin detemir  treatment  was  about  326  days  and  with  a  total  subject  exposure  time  of  145  years  for subjects in the detemir+lira group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The overall pattern and frequencies of the most common adverse events in study NN2211-1842 when insulin  detemir  was  added  to  the  combination  of  liraglutide  1.8mg  +  metfomin  was  similar  to  the overall safety profile observed for liraglutide therapy + metformin therapy. The overall safety profile was further confirmed by week 52 safety data submitted by the MAH during the evaluation.

The AE-profile was initially only presented for AEs occurring in &gt;5% of patients. Following a request from the CHMP, tables presenting TEAES with incidences &gt;1% of subjects were provided by the MAH during  the  evaluation.  No  new  safety  concerns,  besides  the  earlier  mentioned  malignancies,  were identified.

Several adverse events were pre-specified as medical events of special interest (MESIs) most of them originating  from  the  original  MAA  for  liraglutide:  pancreas  related  events,  thyroid  related  events, injection site reactions and neoplasms. A potential signal of an increased lipase was noticed in 11% in the  insulin  detemir  +  liraglutide  group  compared  to  the  other  groups  (3.4%  and  3.8%).  There  was even  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  with  increased  lipase  who  were  not  specified  as  'pancreas related'  lipase  increases,  with  16.0%  subjects  in  the  detemir+lira  group,  10.1%  in  the  lira-control group, and 11.0% in the non-randomised group. It was clarified that the difference between treatment groups was evident also before patients were randomised to study treatment. Serum lipase did not seem to increase over time in any of the treatment groups and most importantly, in study NN22111842 elevated serum lipase was not associated with increases in amylase or the observed events of pancreatitis.

Also  of  note  is  the  frequency  of  neoplasms  reported  during  study  NN  2211-1842.  During  the  main study period (26W) 0%, 0.6% and 2.0% were observed in the detemir+lira group, lira-control group and the non-randomised group, respectively. 52 Weeks safety data were submitted by the MAH during the evaluation in which it became apparent that 7 new cases (4.3%, 6 of them were malignant) of neoplasms were identified in the detemir+lira group during the 26 Week extension period of which one malignant  case  turned  out  to  have  a  wrong  date  of  onset  (event  occurred  before  administration  of insulin detemir). No additional neoplasms were identified in the liraglutide-control group whereas two neoplasms (2.4%), of which one malignant, were observed in the non-randomised liraglutide+metformin group. There was no apparent clustering in the types of neoplasm seen in any of the  detemir+liraglutide+metformin  group.  The  number  of  malignant  neoplasms  was  5  in  the  triple combination arm. In the randomised lira-control group there was one malignant event. Whereas in the non-randomised  lira+met  arm;  there  were  5  malignant  events  in  4  patients.  The  percentage  of malignant events was thus higher in the triple combination arm (5/163; 3.1%) compared to the pooled liraglutide + metformin arms (5/658; 0.8%). The MAH addressed this safety concern by providing nonclinical and clinical information, by conducting further statistical analyses and by providing narratives of all neoplasm cases. The majority of the malignant cases seems confounded by strong risk factors and contributing factors for cancer. None of the conducted post-hoc statistical analyses supported the concern regarding a growth promoting effect of the triple combination treatment. Based on the nonclinical data, the weight of evidence for an additive or synergic tumour promotion due to combination treatments  with  metformin,  insulin  detemir  and  liraglutide  is  currently  considered  sparse  and inconclusive.  Regarding  the  clinical  data,  the  MAH  referred  to  the  well-known  association  of  type  2 diabetes and obesity with certain types of cancer. With respect to the association between insulin, in particular insulin glargin (Lantus) there are controversial data and further data of ongoing observational  studies  are  awaited.  In  summary,  final  conclusions  on  a  potential  risk  of  detemir  and liraglutide cannot be drawn from the current study.

There were no major hypoglycaemic events during the main period. The rate of minor hypoglycaemic episodes was low, but as expected the highest rate for the detemir+lira group: 0.228, 0.034 and 0.115 events  per  subject  years  for  patients  in  the  detemir+lira  group,  lira-control  group  and  the  nonrandomised  liraglutide  1.8  mg+metformin,  respectively.  This  difference  in  minor  hypoglycaemic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

episodes reported between  the two randomised  treatment  groups was  statistically significant (p=0.0011).

## Conclusions on clinical safety

Overall, based on the safety data from this 52 Week study, the overall safety profile observed with insulin detemir in combination with liraglutide is comparable to what is already known for liraglutide and insulin detemir separately. However, more neoplasms were noted in the metformin + liraglutide + detemir  group  but  the  data  are  inconclusive.  The  MAH  has  updated  their  RMP  with  further pharmacovigilance  activities  to  address  this  safety  concern.  This  was  considered  acceptable  by  the CHMP.

## 1.2.9. Risk Management Plan

As  part  of  this  grouping  of  two  type  II  variations,  the  MAH  submitted  an  update  of  the  Risk Management Plan (RMP) (version 13, dated 22 September 2011).

| Details                                            | Spontaneous reports of diabetic ketoacidosis due to discontinuation of insulin in insulin dependent patients were identified during routine safety surveillance of Victoza. Victoza was started in these patients subsequent to insulin discontinuation. Following the Japanese launch of Victoza, a cluster of cases was identified from Japan. Two of the cases had a fatal outcome. The product label in Japan was updated immediately following these incidences. Victoza is the first product of its class (GLP-1 analogue) on the market in Japan, which most likely contributed to the observed cluster of cases as other region have not had similar rates of discontinuation of insulin Based on these findings, the MAH decided to include hyperglycaemia due to discontinuation of insulin as an identified risk in the RMP. |

## Adverse Events/Adverse Reactions

## Important identified risks

Hyperglycaemia due to discontinuation of insulin has been added as an important identified risks:

During routine post-marketing safety surveillance of spontaneous reports, the MAH identified reports containing  events  related  to  hyperglycaemia  due  to  discontinuation  of  insulin  in  insulin-dependent patients. Victoza was started in these patients subsequent to insulin discontinuation. Hyperglycaemia is a known risk in patients who are dependent on insulin to maintain blood glucose homeostasis. When these individual discontinue insulin treatment they develop severe hyperglycaemia, which may lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycaemic coma. The risk of hyperglycaemia is not related to Victoza, but is a consequence of the inappropriate discontinuation of insulin therapy. Therefore, the MAH decided to update the CCDS, 'hyperglycaemia due to discontinuation of insulin' was included as an identified risk in order to closely monitor these reports and follow-up questions have been developed.

| Hypoglycaemia    | Routine and targeted pharmacovigilance Analyses of ongoing and planned climical trials | Labelling -- SmPC: ·Sec. 4.2 Posology and method of administration. Patients receiving Victoza in combination with a sulphonylurea may have an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The risk ofhypoglycaemia can be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea Sec. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use. Victoza should not be used in patients with type 1 口 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis Sec. 4.8 Undesirable effects Most episodes of confirmed hypoglycaemia in clinical studies were minor. No episodes of major hypoglycaemia were observed in the study with Victoza used as monotherapy. Major hypoglycaemia may occur when Victoza is combined with a sulphonylurea (uncommon) or oral anti-diabetics other than sulphonylureas (rare). |

## 1.2.10. Changes to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet

Following the assessment of this grouping of two type II variations, the CHMP endorsed the following changes  to  the  SmPC  and  to  the  Package  Leaflet  (underlined  =  new  text,  strikethrough  =  deleted text):

## Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use of the SmPC

Victoza is not a substitute for insulin.

The addition of liraglutide in patients already treated with insulin has not been evaluated and is therefore not recommended.

## Section 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction of the SmPC

## Insulin

No pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed between liraglutide and insulin detemir when administering a single dose of insulin detemir 0.5 U/kg with liraglutide 1.8 mg at steady state in patients with type 2 diabetes.

## Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties of the SmPC

In a 52 week clinical trial, the addition of insulin detemir to Victoza ®  1.8 mg and metformin in patients not achieving glycemic targets on Victoza ®  and metformin alone, resulted in a HbA1c decrease from baseline of 0.54%, compared to 0.20% in the Victoza ®  1.8 mg and metformin control group. Weight loss was sustained. There was a small increase in the rate of minor hypoglycaemic episodes (0.23 versus 0.03 events per subject years. The addition of liraglutide in patients already treated with insulin has not been evaluated (see section 4.4).

## Section 2 Before you use Victoza of the Package Leaflet

Victoza should not be used if you have type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis. Victoza is not an insulin. Victoza should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years.

In particular, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are using medicines for diabetes containing any of the following active substances:

- insulin. Victoza is not recommended if you are already using insulin.

In  addition  the  MAH  has  taken  the  opportunity  to  align  the  Annexes  with  version  7.3.1  of  the  QRD template, to delete the DDPS version number and to update the RMP version number from Annex IIB. Minor editorial changes have been made throughout the Annexes. Finally in section 6 of the Package Leaflet , the pictures for the instructions of using Victoza have been changed so that the fingers in the pictures are now white instead of yellow.

The CHMP agreed with the changes to the Annexes requested by the MAH listed above.

## 2. Benefit Risk Balance

## Benefits

Initially, the MAH claimed an extension of the indication for Victoza: 'In combination with basal insulin in  patients  not  achieving  adequate  glycaemic  control  with  Victoza  and  metformin'.  This  was  not considered acceptable by the CHMP, as this is an indication for insulin detemir and not for Victoza. To get  an  extension  of  indication  for  Victoza,  the  added  value  of  adding  Victoza  to  insulin  detemir  + metformin should be demonstrated in terms of efficacy and safety. The design of study NN2211-1842 only  gives  information  about  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  insulin  detemir  when  added  to  metformin  + liraglutide. The shortcomings of study NN2211-1842 were acknowledged by the MAH who proposed to include instead only some efficacy and safety data regarding study NN2211-1842 in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

The MAH submitted two clinical trials: one PK/PD trial (study NN2211-3673)and one clinical efficacy and safety study (study NN2211-1842).

During  the  PK/PD  study  (study  NN2211-3673),  no  pharmacokinetic  interaction  between  insulin  and liraglutide was observed. According to the predefined no effect boundary of [0.8, 1.25], liraglutide at steady  state  did  not  affect  the  pharmacokinetic  endpoints  (AUC,  C max )  of  insulin  detemir  and  vice versa. No pharmacodynamic interaction was observed; the treatments had an additive effect. The sum of the mean AUCGIR for liraglutide and insulin detemir given individually was similar to that obtained when the two were given in combination.

In  the  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  trial  NN221-1842  patients  included  were  a  relatively  healthy subgroup of type 2 DM patients. Furthermore, the trial design was open-label. The study duration was 52 weeks, and the number of patients participating in the study was limited (total study population 323  patients).  Patients  inadequately  controlled  by  Metformin  ( ≥ 1500 mg daily) or Metformin + low dose SU ( ≤ half maximum dose) were switched to Metformin (same dose) + Liraglutide 1.8 mg daily. Subjects not adequately controlled after 12 weeks were randomised to receive insulin detemir as addon to Metformin + Liraglutide or continued on Metformin + Liraglutide. Addition of insulin to liraglutide + metformin demonstrated a favourable, clinically relevant effect on the blood glucose control in terms of HbA1c reduction. The change from baseline in HbA1c in the triple therapy group at week 26 was (LS mean changes) -0.51%, vs. +0.02% in the metformin + liraglutide group (difference -0.52 [CI: -0.68; -0.36]).  The  estimated  proportions  of  subjects  achieving  HbA1c  both  &lt;7%  and ≤ 6.5%  were significantly greater with insulin detemir + liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin (44% and 19%) compared to liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin (20% and 7%).

Improvements in other endpoints of glucose control were observed, including mean change in FPG and changes  in  post-prandial  glucose  levels.  The  glucose  lowering  effects  were  sustained  during  the extension period up to week 52.

After 52 weeks, a mean reduction in body weight was observed in all treatment groups. However, the reduction in body weight was less when insulin was added to the metformin + liraglutide treatment. The estimated mean reductions in body weight were 0.05 kg and 1.02 kg in the detemir+lira group and lira-control group, respectively, with an estimated mean difference (95% CI) between groups of 0.97 (0.04; 1.91), p=0.0416.

The  overall  pattern  and  frequencies  of  the  most  common  adverse  events  in  study  NN2211-1842 corresponds to what was observed during the original MAA for liraglutide and insulin detemir, except for  the  frequency  of  nasopharyngitis which was considerably higher in the lira-control group vs. the other  two  treatment  groups  after  26  weeks  as  well  as  vs.  the  original  dossier  for  liraglutide  1.8% (20.8% vs. 11.0-14.7% vs. 8.8%).

The most commonly reported adverse events during the 52-Week study (run-in, 26-week main and 26-week extension period) were nasopharyngitis, nausea and, diarrhoea reported by 20.2%, 18.4% and 17.8% in the detemir+lira group versus and 25.2%, 23.3% and 16.4% of subjects in the liracontrol group. Thyroid related adverse events were reported in all treatment groups, with 1.2% and 2.5% of subjects reporting an event in the detemir+lira group and the lira-control group respectively.

The  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  serious  adverse  events  during  the  52-Week  trial  period  was 10.4% in the detemir+lira group, versus 6.9% in the lira-control group. Most of the serious adverse events were evaluated as unlikely related to trial product and no clustering of events was observed.

No  major  hypoglycaemic  events  were  seen  during  the  main  period  of  the  trial.  The  rate  of  minor hypoglycaemic episodes was higher in the detemir+lira group, compared with the lira-control group, with  0.228  and  0.034  events  per  subject  years  respectively.  The  estimated  rate  ratio  (detemir+lira group/lira-control group) in minor hypoglycaemic episodes was 6.80 (2.14; 21.60), p=0.0011 .



After submission of the safety data from the 26 weeks extension study it became apparent that the number  of  patients  with  a  neoplasm  was  highest  in  the  triple  combination  arm  (insulin  detemir  + liraglutide + metformin). The number of malignant neoplasms was 6 in the triple combination arm, of which  one,  however,  had  a  wrong  date  of  onset  (event  occurred  before  administration  of  insulin detemir) which leaves 5 patients with malignant event. In the randomised liraglutide + metformin arm, there was 1 patient with a malignant neoplasm and in the non-randomised lira+met arm arm there were 5 malignant events in 4 patients. The percentage of malignant events was thus higher in the triple  combination arm (5/163; 3.1%) compared to the pooled liraglutide + meformin arms (5/658; 0.8%).

The overall incidence of pancreas-related TEAEs was higher in the detemir+lira group (11.0%) when compared the randomised and non-randomised liraglutide + metformin groups (7.5% and 5.4%). The increased incidence was mainly related to increases in blood lipase.

Thyroid  related  AEs  were  comparable  across  treatment  groups  and  was  overall  comparable  to  the frequency observed in the original MAA for Liraglutide. The most frequently reported thyroid related adverse event in all treatment groups was increased calcitonin, which was reported by single or few subjects in each treatment group.

Liraglutide and insulin detemir antibodies were observed, however, the duration of the study seems too short to determine the relevance of the observed antibodies for long term efficacy and safety.

Based on the original dossier cardiac events represent a possible concern for liraglutide and is included in the RMP for liraglutide as a potential risk. In addition, long-term follow up data on cardiac safety is being  collected  in  the  5  year  cardiovascular  outcome  study.  Study  NN2211-1842  did  not  show increased cardiac safety issues in the liraglutide + insulin detemir + metformin group compared to the liarglutide control group.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

In  clinical  study  NN2211-1842,  the  addition  of  insulin  to  patients  insufficiently  controlled  with metformin and liraglutide demonstrated a favourable, clinically relevant effect on blood glucose control in  terms  of  HbA1c  reduction,  including  an  increased  proportion  of  patients  achieving  the  clinically relevant goal of HbA1c &lt; 7%. This is supported by the effect on FPG, and post-prandial glucose levels seen during the study. No unexpected effects occurred; an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia was observed, but not unexpectedly high and low in severity.

However, this study raised some major issues.

Firstly, this study design only gives information about the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir when added to metformin + liraglutide and not about the efficacy and safety of liraglutide added to insulin. Triple therapy might have an advantage over combination treatment with metformin and insulin alone in terms of lower insulin dosage, fewer hypoglycaemic episodes and less weight gain, while achieving the same level of glucose control. However, this was not studied in this trial and currently, literature to address this possible advantage is lacking. Thus, the combination cannot be accepted as a separate indication. However, information on the addition of insulin to liraglutide is considered relevant for daily practice and therefore information on this combination has been added in the relevant sections of the SmPC.

The  excess  incidence  of  malignant  neoplasms  in  the  triple  combination  arm  (insulin  detemir  + liraglutide  +  metformin)  is  a  major  safety  concern.  Despite  the  fact  that  the  neoplasms  represent different  locations  and  types/histology,  a  general  tumour  promoting  effect  cannot  be  excluded.  The MAH  addressed  this  issue  by  providing  non-clinical  and  clinical  information,  by  conducting  further statistical analyses and by providing narratives of all neoplasm cases. The majority of the malignant cases  seem  confounded  by  strong  risk  factors  and  contributing  factors  for  cancer.  None  of  the conducted post-hoc statistical analyses supported the concern regarding a growth promoting effect of the triple combination treatment. Based on the non-clinical data, the weight of evidence for an additive or  synergic  tumour  promotion  due  to  combination  treatments  with  metformin,  insulin  detemir  and liraglutide  is  currently  considered  sparse  and  inconclusive.  Regarding  the  clinical  data,  the  MAH referred to the well-known association of type 2 diabetes and obesity with certain types of cancer. With respect  to  the  association  between  insulin,  in  particular  insulin  glargin  (Lantus)  and  cancer,  the currently available data are controversial and further data from the ongoing observational studies are awaited. In summary, final conclusions on a potential increased risk of cancer with the combination of insulin detemir and liraglutide cannot be drawn from study NN2211-1842. This issue is addressed by the MAH in the RMP. Further data will be obtained both from observational data and data from the liraglutide randomised clinical CV outcome study.

Pancreatitis  related  events  were  reported,  but  the  incidence  was  very  low,  allowing  no  conclusions. None of the 2 cases of pancreatitis occurred in the triple therapy group, but the overall incidence of pancreas-related  TEAEs  was  higher  in  this  group.  The  increased  incidence  was  mainly  related  to increases in blood lipase. This was the first trial with regular lipase and amylase measurements. It is acknowledged that although serum lipase  and  amylase  elevations  may  be  diagnostic  of  pancreatitis (levels usually above three times the UNL) the prevalence in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is not well characterised. Already at run-in, patients had relatively high lipase levels and these levels did not seem to increase over time in any of the treatment groups. Most importantly, in study NN22111842 elevated serum lipase was not associated with increases in amylase or the observed events of pancreatitis. A placebo arm would have been necessary in order to get a clearer picture on the clinical relevance of increases of lipase levels.

Thyroid  related  AEs  were  comparable  across  treatment  groups  and  was  overall  comparable  to  the frequency observed in the original MAA for Liraglutide. The most frequently reported thyroid related

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adverse event in all treatment groups was increased calcitonin, which was reported by single or few subjects in each treatment group.

Liraglutide and insulin detemir antibodies were observed, however, the duration of the study seems too short to determine the relevance of the observed antibodies for long term efficacy and safety.

Altogether,  combination  therapy  of  metformin  +  liraglutide  +  basal  insulin  might  be  useful  in  a selective patient population for the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2.

## Conclusions on the Benefit-Risk Balance

The indication for the combination of liraglutide + metformin with basal insulin has not been accepted by the CHMP as information on the addition of liraglutide to insulin detemir + metformin is lacking. However, information on the addition of insulin detemir to liraglutide is considered relevant for daily practice  and  therefore  information  on  this  combination  in  the  SmPC  is  considered  acceptable  in  the relevant sections.

| C.I.6.a                  | Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one                                                         | II     |
| C.I.4                    | Variations related to significant modifications of the Summary of Product Characteristics due in particular to new quality, pre-clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | II     |

- -Extension of indication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in combination with basal insulin in patients not achieving adequate glycaemic control with Victoza and metformin alone: update to sections 4.1, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and consequential changes to sections 1 and 2 of the Package Leaflet
- -Update to section 4.4 of the SmPC to include a warning that Victoza is not a substitute for insulin and  consequential  changes  to  section  2  of  the  Package  Leaflet,  following  post-marketing spontaneous reports of ketoacidosis in patients switching from insulin to Victoza. In addition the MAH has taken the opportunity to align the Annexes with version 7.3.1 of the QRD template and to  delete  the  DDPS  version  number  from  Annex IIB.  Minor  editorial  changes  have  been  made throughout  the  Annexes.  Finally  in  section  6  of  the  Package  Leaflet,  the  pictures  for  the instructions of using Victoza have been changed so that the fingers in the pictures are now white instead of yellow.

Due to the major objections raised by the CHMP on the design of study NN2211-1842, the MAH did not pursue  anymore  an  extension  of  indication  for  Victoza  for  the  treatment  of  type  2  diabetes  in combination with basal insulin in patients not achieving adequate glycaemic control with Victoza and metformin alone but instead proposed to update the Victoza SmPC with the results of study NN22111842.

On 22 September 2011 the CHMP considered this group of two type II variations:

- -Update to sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 of the SmPC and consequential changes to section 2 of the Package Leaflet based on the results of study NN2211-3673 (combination of insulin deternir +

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Victoza pharmacology study) and study NN2211-1842 (phase III study investigating the efficacy and safety of adding insulin detemir to the combination Victoza + metformin).

- -Update to section 4.4 of the SmPC to include a warning that Victoza is not a substitute for insulin and  consequential  changes  to  section  2  of  the  Package  Leaflet,  following  post-marketing spontaneous reports of ketoacidosis in patients switching from insulin to Victoza. In addition the MAH has taken the opportunity to align the Annexes with version 7.3.1 of the QRD template, to delete the DDPS version number and to update the RMP version number from Annex IIB. Minor editorial changes have been made throughout the Annexes. Finally in section 6 of the Package Leaflet, the pictures for the instructions of using Victoza have been changed so that the fingers in the pictures are now white instead of yellow.

to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the  amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet.
