## 1.1 Introduction

Reyataz  (atazanavir/ATV),  in  combination  with  low  dose  ritonavir  (RTV),  is  indicated  for  the treatment of HIV-1 in antiretroviral (ARV) treatment-experienced patients. The recommended dose for ATV/RTV is 300/100 mg once daily with food.

The Marketing Authorisation (MA) of this protease inhibitor was granted on 2 March 2004 on the basis of a pivotal study (AI424045 or 045) in ARV-experienced patients where RTV-boosted ATV was  compared  to  the  fixed  combination  of  lopinavir  and  ritonavir  (Kaletra,  LPV/RTV).  Given  the limited efficacy/safety data derived from study 045 (circa 100 treated patients per arm) the MA was granted under exceptional circumstances.

As part of the post approval commitments, the MAH was requested 'to provide clinical data from the use  of  atazanavir  boosted  with  ritonavir  within  triple  once  daily  combination  expected  to  be increasingly  used  in  clinical  practice  with  the  arrival  of  the  once  daily  ATV/RTV  association' (specific obligation clinical number 3).

The MAH had provided within the initial MA application (MAA) the results of a study performed in antiretroviral  naïve  patients  with  atazanavir  unboosted  (400  mg  once  daily,  QD)  compared  to efavirenz  (EFV).  Due  to  the  fact  that  this  study  was  flawed  by  methodological  problems,  no  MA could  be  granted  in  antiretroviral  naïve  patients  at  the  time  of  the  original  approval.  In  the  USA, contrarily to Europe, Reyataz was approved in ARV-naïve and in ARV-experienced patients with the following dose recommendation: 400 mg QD with food and 300 mg QD with RTV 100 mg QD with food, respectively.

Within this procedure, the MAH applies for an extension of the therapeutic indication of ATV/RTV 300/100  mg  QD  to  include  ARV-naïve  patients.  This  indication  is  supported  by  the  48-week  data from a randomised open-label study (AI424138 or 138) conducted in ARV-naïve patients to assess the efficacy  of  ATV/RTV  compared  to  LPV/RTV, in combination with a NRTI fixed-association [i.e. Tenofovir DF (TDF) + Emtricitabine (FTC)].

In support of the ATV/RTV 300/100 mg QD regimen safety profile in ARV-naïve patients, the MAH also included in this submission data obtained from a previous study (AI424089 or 089).

The  96-week  data  of  study  089  were  previously  assessed  by  the  CHMP  (Reyataz  FUM  057).  The study was judged open to criticism as regards the efficacy demonstration given that it consisted in the comparison  of  two  non  validated  arms  in  antiretroviral  naïve  patients.  This  study  confirmed  the CHMP's concern that the unboosted regimen of Reyataz (400 mg QD) might not offer an optimal therapeutic  management  to  antiretroviral  naïve  patients  as  compared  to  the  boosted  regimen (substantiated  by  the  efficacy  as  well  as  by  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  sub  analysis).  Within  this submission, however, this study is rather aimed at completing the safety database.

Moreover, to support proposed changes in the SPC regarding the interaction of ATV/RTV with TDF, the MAH has performed a PK substudy within study 138 and a combined statistical analyses of ATV PK available data from patients in the current (138) and previous studies (074, 089 and 137). It was previously  observed  that  TDF  decreases  the  ATV  plasma  concentrations  through  an  unknown mechanism. Therefore, this issue was further explored by the MAH within this submission.

In addition, the food effect on ATV PK was assessed in study 172, with ATV co-administered with RTV. So far, only food effect on unboosted ATV had been assessed. Subsequent to results of study 172, an updated wording is proposed for the SPC.

The MAH also submitted updated versions of the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) and of the Pharmacovigilance  System.  Version  1.0  the  Risk  Management  Plan  (RMP)  had  already  been submitted and assessed in the framework of the Annex II application EMEA/H/C/494/X/33.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH proposed to update sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SPC. The PL was updated accordingly; in addition, the MAH took this opportunity to update the contact details for their local representatives in Denmark and Romania.

## 1.2 Toxico-pharmacological aspects - Environmental Risk Analysis

Within  this  extension  of  indication  variation,  the  potential  environmental  risks  from  the  use  and excretion of the active substance ATV were evaluated to support the addition of naïve patients to the treatment population.

This  assessment  has  been  conducted  under  the  EMEA  2006 Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use .

## Conclusion

The  Phase  I  Predicted  Environmental  Concentration  of  ATV  in  surface  water  (PECsurface  water ) was calculated to be = 0.0015 mg/L or 1.5 µg/L. The estimated PEC exceeded the proposed action limit of 0.01 µg/L. Therefore a Phase II assessment was needed. Regarding the phase II-Tier A, the evaluation of  PEC/PNEC  (Predicted  No  Effect  Concentration  in  surface  water)  ratios  for  surface  water  and groundwater all gave ratios below 1 and for microorganisms well below 0.1, indicating that there are no specific concerns for the environment.

However  ATV  appears  to  be  very  slowly  transformed  in  aerobic  and  anaerobic  sediments.  A complementary  Chironomid  emergence  study  (OECD  218)  will  be  undertaken  by  the  MAH  and results will be provided as soon as possible in order to give a final conclusion on the environmental risk assessment for ATV.

The log Kow 1 (between 3.47 and 3.17 depending of pH) did not exceed the limit value (4.5). However, it showed that ATV was moderately lipophilic. In addition, ATV was stable in the environment. This could have triggered a study to evaluate bio-concentration factor in fish, but as the elimination halflife of ATV was short (7 hours) and as it is not requested by the guideline, the lack of this study is acceptable.

## 1.3 Clinical aspects - Pharmacology

## PK substudy 138

## Study Design

This study was designed as a Week 4 Intensive PK Sub-Study of the 96 week Study Comparing the Antiviral Efficacy and Safety of ATV/RTV with LPV/RTV, Each in Combination with Fixed Dose TDF-FTC in  HIV-1  Infected  Treatment  Naïve  Subjects.  Its  objectives  were  the  assessment  of  the steady  state  pharmacokinetics  of  ATV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV  in  the  presence  of  an  ARV  regimen including TDF at week 4 and to compare the differential effect of ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV on the pharmacokinetics of TDF at week 4. In addition the comparison of the differential effect of ATV and LPV on the pharmacokinetics of RTV at week 4 was done as well as the assessment of the inhibitory quotients (IQ) of ATV and LPV at week 4 (when dosed with RTV).

For this intensive PK substudy, at the week 4 visit, blood for plasma was to be drawn at predose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 h post dosing with ATV/RTV and TDF all given once daily and at predose, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 h post dosing with LPV/RTV given twice daily and TDF given once daily. Plasma samples were analysed for ATV,  LPV,  RTV,  and  TDF  (according to treatment regimen) concentrations by validated assay methods. 40 subjects were planned of which 39 were analysed. The treatment groups were as follows:

1 Octanol-water  partition  coefficient  (K ow):  A  measurement  of  how  a  chemical  is  distributed  at  equilibrium between octanol and water. It is an important parameter and is used often in the assessment of environmental fate and transport for organic chemicals. Additionally, Kow is a key variable used in the estimation of other properties.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatment Group A (test product):

ATV: 2 x 150 mg capsules once daily (QD) with food (meal or snack) RTV: 1 x 100 mg capsule once daily with food (meal or snack)

TDF/FTC: 1 x 300/200 mg fixed dose combination tablet once daily (meal or snack)

## Treatment Group B (reference therapy):

LPV/RTV: 3 x 133/33.3 mg capsules twice daily (BID) (meal or snack)

TDF/FTC: 1 x 300/200 mg fixed dose combination tablet once daily (meal or snack)

The following PK parameters were evaluated for ATV, LPV, RTV and TDF:

- Cmax: Maximum observed concentration at week 4
- Cmin: Plasma concentration at the end of the intensive PK dosing interval at week 4
- Tmax: Time to reach Cmax at week 4
- AUC(TAU): Area under the concentration-time curve, in one dosing interval [AUC(TAU)] from time
- o 0 to 12 hours for LPV and RTV in the LPV/RPV regimen,
- o 0-24 hours for ATV and RTV in the ATV/RTV regimen, and
- o 0-24 hours for tenofovir in both regimens at week 4.
- T-HALF: Dosing interval terminal half-life at week 4.

For RTV in the LPV/RTV regimen, the following parameter was also estimated:

- AUC(0-24): Estimated as 2 times the AUC(TAU) based on 12-hour PK.

Inhibitory quotient (IQ) was determined, calculated as the concentration at plasma trough concentration (Cmin) divided by the protein binding adjusted EC90 for each individual subject HIV-1 strain  for  either  ATV  or  LPV.  The  IQ  of  ATV  was  compared  to the IQ of LPV using analyses of variance performed on log (IQ).

## Outcome

## Pharmacokinetic Population

Among the 883 subjects randomised in study 138, a total of 39 subjects were enrolled in the intensive PK substudy (18 patients in the ATV/RTV arm and 21 patients in the LPV/RTV arm).

Because  of  extremely  high  values  of  AUC(TAU),  Cmax  and  Cmin  of  TDF  for  one  subject  in  the LPV/RTV  group  (pneumonia,  dehydration,  transient  decrease  in  renal  function),  summary  and statistical analysis with and without this subject were performed.

## Pharmacokinetic Results for ATV and LPV

The PK parameters obtained for ATV and LPV are given in the following tables.

Results from table 3 suggest an approximately 24% difference between ATV IQ and LPV IQ when co-administered with RTV and TDF.

Except for one subject in the LPV/RTV treatment group with a considerably higher IQ (IQ = 129), there  was  considerable  overlap  in  individual  IQ  values  and  distribution  between  ATV/RTV  and LPV/RTV groups. Fifteen (15) of 17 (88%) patients in the ATV group and all patients in the LPV group achieved IQ &gt; 10. There were no subjects from either group with an IQ &lt; 4. The lowest two IQ values in the ATV group were 4 and 7; the lowest IQ in the LPV group was 11.

## Conclusions regarding PK substudy 138

The intensive PK assessment at week 4 indicated that when both ATV and LPV were co-administered with RTV and TDF, both regimens achieved a comparable IQ. The geometric mean IQ was estimated to be 27 for ATV and 36 for LPV, suggesting similar in vivo activity for the two regimens in these HIV-treatment naïve patients; no individual subject had an IQ &lt;4.

Although the difference between the ATV and LPV IQ was calculated to be approximately 24%, the 90% CI for the ratio of the geometric mean values for ATV vs. LPV included 1.00 (with a wide CI). The median IQ (interquantile range) was also similar between both regimens (ATV 35 [20, 50]; LPV 34 [21, 60]). The lowest IQ in the ATV regimen was 4 (vs. 11 with LPV). Therefore these differences were not considered to be relevant.

TDF exposures were similar in both regimens, suggesting ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV increase TDF exposures to a similar extent.

As expected, this study showed that ATV concentrations were somewhat lower when combined with TDF. Nevertheless, as demonstrated by the efficacy results (discussed below), no detrimental clinical effect of this lower exposure in combination with TDF was observed.

## Study 172 - Effect of food

## Study Design

This  was  an  open-label,  randomized,  three-period,  three-treatment,  crossover  study  in  healthy subjects.  Subjects  underwent  screening  evaluations  to  determine  eligibility  within  21  days  prior  to first study dose. Subjects were admitted to the clinical facility the evening prior to dosing (Day -1) for each  period.  Prior  to  Period  1,  42  subjects  were  randomized  to  receive  1  of  6  sequences  of  3 treatments including:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatment A

A single oral dose of ATV 300 mg (2 x 150 mg capsules) with RTV 100 mg (1 x 100 mg capsule) in a fasted condition,

## Treatment B

A single oral dose of ATV 300 mg with RTV 100 mg after consuming a standard light breakfast

## Treatment C

A single oral dose of ATV 300 mg with RTV 100 mg after consuming a standard high fat breakfast.

There was a ≥ 7  day  washout  period  between  each  dose.  For each treatment period, subjects were confined to the clinical facility until at least 72 hours post-dose. Blood samples were collected for PK analysis up to 72 hours post-dose. Physical examinations,  vital  sign  measurements,  12-lead electrocardiograms  (ECG),  and  clinical  laboratory  evaluations  were  performed  at  selected  times throughout the study. Subjects were closely monitored for adverse events (AEs) throughout the study.

A  total  of  60  subjects  were  enrolled  and  42  were  treated  in  this  study.    Thirty-nine  (39)  subjects completed the study.

## Pharmacokinetic Results

Study  AI424172  showed that  a  standard  light  meal  intake  (Treatment  B)  improved  ATV  exposure after ATV/RTV dosing, as indicated by 40%, 33%, and 40% increases in Cmax, AUC(INF), and C24, respectively. A standard light meal is more representative of patients' typical daily meals than a highfat,  high-calorie  meal  being used in a standard food-effect assessment, thus is more relevant to the clinical setting. The increased bioavailability of ATV administered after a light meal was observed in the  majority  of  the  subjects  (67%),  and  especially  in  all  10  subjects  who  had  relatively  low  ATV exposures  (defined  as  AUC[INF]  below  20,000  ng*h/ml,  and  C24  below  200  ng/ml)  when  dosed under fasted condition.

When ATV/RTV was administered with a high-fat meal (Treatment C), C24 increased by about 33%, even though the Cmax and AUC were similar to the fasted condition.

As the observed difference could have been driven by two outlier results, the analysis was redone, excluding  the  2  patients  who  had  substantially  higher  C24.  This  re-analysis  showed  a  positive

geometric  mean  ratio  of  1.28  (90%  CI  =  [1.14,  1.44])  with  a  high-fat  meals  vs.  fasted  condition, confirming an improvement for C24 in the majority of subjects when ATV/RTV was administered with food (see also table 6).

## Conclusions regarding study 172

When considering the mean PK results but also the individual data, food intake improves the ATV exposure after  ATV/RTV dosing, especially in the  area  of  lower  AUC and Cmin values. Whereas food  does  not  reduce  the  variability  of  ATV  PK  parameters  when  co-administered  with  RTV,  it favourably impacts the ATV critical C24 values.

Higher values of Cmin and AUC seemed to be driven by two outlier individuals. The re-analysis for the high fat meal showed that, even when excluding the two outlier patients with higher C24 values, food still increases the mean C24 value by 28%.

Taking these results into consideration, the fact that ATV/RTV was administered with food in study 138,  that  taking  ATV/RTV  in  fasted  state  might  expose  some  patients  to  sub-optimal  ATV concentrations, and that the poor gastro-intestinal tolerance of RTV generally drives an intake with food, the recommendation to take ATV/RTV with food should be maintained.

## 1.4 Clinical aspects - Efficacy

## Main study - AI424138

## Design

Study  138  is  an  ongoing  open-label,  randomised,  multicentre  study  comparing  ATV/RTV  vs. LPV/RTV at weeks 48 and 96.  The primary objective was to determine the proportion of patients who achieved HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/ml at week 48. Important secondary efficacy objectives were to assess the proportion of patients who achieved HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/ml at week 96, the proportion of patients with HIV RNA &lt; 400 copies/ml (c/ml), the change from baseline in HIV RNA, and the change from baseline in CD4 cell count, all at weeks 48 and 96. The resistance profiles of patients experiencing virologic failure were also assessed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study population comprised 883 antiretroviral-naïve patients with screening HIV RNA ≥ 5000 c/ml.  Patients  who  received  any  antiretroviral  therapy  within  30  days  prior  to  screening,  or  prior antiretroviral  therapy ≥ 1  week  were  excluded,  with  exceptions  granted  for  prior  antiretroviral exposure in specific settings, as described by the protocol. Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive ATV/RTV or LPV/RTV, each co-administered with TDF/FTC. Randomisation was stratified by qualifying HIV RNA (&lt; 100,000 or ≥ 100,000 c/ml) and geographic region. Treatment continued through week 96.

## Statistics

Study 138 was designed as a non-inferiority study. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/ml at week 48. The principal analysis of the primary endpoint was based  on  the  Confirmed  Virologic  Response  (CVR)  Non-Completer  =  Failure  (NC  =  F)  response definition.

Supportive  analyses  used  CVR  Non-Completer  =  Missing  (NC  =  M),  time  to  loss  of  virologic response  (TLOVR),  and  Virologic  Response  -  Observed  Cases  (VR-OC)  definitions.  The  efficacy endpoints HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/ml and HIV RNA &lt; 400 c/ml at week 48 were both analysed using the CVR definition.

Efficacy analyses were stratified as randomised by qualifying HIV RNA and region. Treatments were compared using the difference in proportions (ATV/RTV - comparator) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)  based  on  a  stratified  normal  approximation.  ATV/RTV  was  determined  to  be  similar  (noninferior) to the comparator if the lower confidence limit (CL) for the difference in proportions was greater than -10%.

## Outcome Definitions for HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/ml

## Confirmed Virologic Response (CVR)

CVR defines  response  as  confirmed  HIV  RNA  &lt; 50 c/ml  at  week  48  for  NC  =  F.  CVR  uses  the TLOVR definition  of  response  and  failure  but  allows  for  re-suppression  (i.e.,  patients  could  have confirmed HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/ml at week 48 having previously experienced virologic rebound).

The supportive  analysis  CVR  Non-Completers  =  Missing (NC = M) excludes patients who do not have minimum follow-up (i.e., who discontinued prior to obtaining week 48 HIV RNA). Minimum follow-up was based on the lower boundary of the week 48 visit window, and was defined as at least 42 weeks of study therapy with HIV RNA on or after 42 weeks.

## Time to loss of virologic response (TLOVR)



TLOVR defines response at week 48 as confirmed HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/ml through week 48 without intervening  virologic  rebound  or  treatment  discontinuation.  Virologic  rebound  was  defined  as confirmed on-treatment HIV RNA ≥ 50 c/ml or last on-treatment HIV RNA ≥ 50 c/ml followed by discontinuation. Patients were considered failures if they experienced virologic rebound at or before week 48, discontinued before week 48, never responded by week 48, never received study therapy, or had  missing  HIV  RNA  at  week  48  and  beyond.  Patients  were  classified  as  completers  if  they  had minimum follow-up, as defined above. Completers could fail based only on their HIV RNA results without regard to discontinuation.

## Virologic Response - Observed Cases (VR-OC)

VR-OC classifies patients who remained on study therapy as responders according to a single HIV RNA measurement  &lt;  50  c/ml  closest  to  the  planned  week  48  visit  and  within  a  pre-defined  visit window. The denominator was based on patients who remained on study therapy through week 48. Patients with HIV RNA ≥ 50 c/ml were considered failures. Patients who remain on study therapy and were  missing  their  week  48  measurement  were  responders  only  if  the  previous  and  subsequent measurements were &lt; 50 c/ml.

## Treatment Outcomes

Treatment outcomes at week 48 for HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/ml were tabulated by treatment based on CVR (NC  =  F).  Outcome  categories  were  responder  (responder  without  rebound,  or  re-suppressed  after



<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rebound),  virologic  failure  (virologic  rebound,  never  suppressed  through  week  48  and  on  study  at week 48, or discontinued due to insufficient viral load response [as determined by the investigator]), discontinued  before  achieving  confirmed  suppression,  discontinued  while  suppressed,  and  never treated. Tabulations also included reasons for discontinuation before achieving confirmed suppression, and reasons for discontinuation while suppressed. Treatment outcomes were based on the primary reason for failure through week 48.

## HIV RNA &lt; 400 c/ml at week 48

The  proportion  of  patients  with  HIV  RNA  &lt;  400  c/ml  at  week  48  was  assessed  using  methods analogous to those used for analysis of HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/ml, including treatment outcomes.

## CD4 Cell Count Changes

Regimens were compared using the difference (ATV/RTV - LPV/RTV) in mean CD4 changes from baseline at Weeks 24 and 48.

Comparisons  used  difference  estimates  and  95%  CIs  based  on  normal  approximations  stratified  as randomised  by  qualifying  HIV  RNA  level  (&lt;  100,000  and ≥ 100,000  c/ml)  and  geographic  region (Africa,  Asia,  Europe,  North  America,  South  America).  The difference estimate and standard error were  computed  within  the  10  randomisation  strata  and  combined  using  a  weighted  average  with weights proportional to stratum size (CMH weighting).

Principal  analyses  used  observed  values,  while  sensitivity  analyses  used  LOCF  to  address  missing values due to missed visits or discontinuation. Missing values were replaced with the last available measurement in the previous visit window. Baseline was carried forward for randomised subjects who had no on-treatment measurements.

## HIV RNA Changes

HIV  RNA  levels  and  changes  from  baseline  were  summarised  through  week  48  using  observed values. Treatment regimens were compared using the difference between ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV in mean  HIV  RNA  changes  from  baseline  (log10  c/ml)  at  weeks  24  and  48,  using  the  methodology described above for CD4 changes.

## Efficacy Subgroup Analyses and Subpopulation Analyses

The following key efficacy endpoints at week 48 were tabulated by efficacy subgroups:

- Proportions of patients with HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/ml using CVR (NC = F and NC = M)
- CD4 cell count change from baseline.
- Proportions of patients with HIV RNA &lt; 400 c/ml using CVR (NC = F and NC = M)

The efficacy subgroups were defined by categories of HIV RNA and CD4 cell count:

- Qualifying HIV RNA &lt; 100,000 and ≥ 100,000 c/ml
- Baseline HIV RNA &lt; 100,000, 100,000 to &lt; 500,000 and ≥ 500,000 c/ml
- Baseline CD4 cell count &lt; 50, 50 to &lt; 100, 100 to &lt; 200, and ≥ 200 cells/mm 3
- Baseline HIV RNA (c/ml) and CD4 cell count (cells/mm 3 ): &lt; 100,000 and &lt; 100; &lt; 100,000 and ≥ 100; ≥ 100,000 and &lt; 100; ≥ 100,000 and ≥ 100

Patient disposition, demographics, baseline characteristics and the 3 key efficacy endpoints at week 48 were tabulated by the subpopulations of gender, race, region, and baseline HBV/HCV co-infection. In  addition,  proportions  with  HIV  RNA  &lt;  50  c/ml  and  HIV  RNA  &lt;  400  c/ml  were  tabulated  by baseline  HIV  subtype.  Subpopulations  were  gender,  race,  region,  baseline  HBV/HCV co-infection, and baseline HIV subtype.

## Resistance Profiles

Genotypic  and  phenotypic  resistance  profiles  were  tabulated  for  patients  who  met  criteria  for virologic failure through week 48 for HIV RNA ≥ 400 c/ml. Virologic failure was defined using CVR (NC = F) as virologic rebound without re-suppression, never suppressed and on study through week 48, or discontinued due to insufficient viral load response before week 48.

## Outcomes

## Patient Disposition

A  total  of  883  patients  were  randomised  (440  ATV/RTV,  443  LPV/RTV);  878  were  treated  (438 ATV/RTV, 440 LPV/RTV); 753 (385 ATV/RTV, 368 LPV/RTV) were continuing on treatment at data  cut-off  (48  weeks)  for  this  analysis  (11  June  2007).  Three  patients  were  randomised  to  the LPV/RTV regimen but received ATV/RTV during the entire treatment period. These were grouped as-randomised  to  LPV/RTV  in  all  efficacy  analyses,  including  VR-OC.  Ninety-seven  patients discontinued through week 48 (39 ATV/RTV, 58 LPV/RTV). As of data cut-off for this analysis, 28 discontinued on or after week 48 (14 on each regimen). The most common ( ≥ 2% total) reasons for discontinuation  through  week  48  were  adverse  event,  poor/non-compliance,  and  withdrawal  of consent.

## Demographics and Baseline Disease Characteristics

Overall,  demographic  characteristics  were  balanced  between  regimens.    The  median  baseline  HIV RNA and the  proportions  with  baseline  HIV  RNA  &gt;  100,000  c/ml  and  the  proportions  with  CD4 &lt; 50 cells/mm 3 at baseline were balanced. Most patients had baseline CD4 cell counts in the range of 100 to &lt; 350 cells/mm 3 . Across treatment groups, 66% of patients had subtype B, including 80% of patients  in  Europe,  100%  in  North  America,  and  78%  in  South  America.  Subtype  C  was  more frequent in Africa (89%) but infrequent (&lt; 5%) in all other regions. The rates of hepatitis B and C co infection were balanced, though only very few cases were present.

## Results

## Summary

ATV/RTV was non-inferior to LPV/RTV, as assessed by the primary efficacy endpoint at week 48 using CVR (NC = F). The lower CL of the difference estimate was greater than the boundary of -10%, supporting  non-inferiority.  Non-inferiority  was  confirmed  by  supportive  analyses  for  the  primary endpoint (CVR NC = M, VR-OC, and TLOVR) and by analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoint. The mean changes from baseline at week 48 in CD4 cell count were comparable.

a Principal analysis of the primary endpoint b Hazard ratio  estimates  (ATV/RTV:LPV/RTV) and 95% CIs are 0.93 (0.71, 1.23) for HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/ml, and 0.78 (0.56, 1.09) for HIV RNA &lt; 400 c/ml

## Primary Endpoint

## HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/ml

Most subjects achieved HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/ml by Week 24. Response rates at Week 48 ranged from 76% to 89% across regimens, depending on the analysis (see table 7 above). The response rates were similar  in  both  groups  and  the  pre-specified  definition  for  non-inferiority  was  achieved,  with  the lower bound of the CI being 3.8%. (for CVR (NC=F)).

When the results were stratified by baseline subgroups, it became evident that for both treatment arms the  response  rates  were  lower  (10%)  in  patients  with  a  higher  viral  load  (above  100  000  c/ml)  as compared  to  those  with  a  viral  load  below  100  000  c/ml  (see  table  8).  The  effect  of  ATV/RTV compared to LPV/RTV was consistent across sub-groups.

The primary efficacy endpoint (HIV RNA &lt;50 c/ml at Week 48) was reassessed using CVR on the evaluable  per  protocol  cohort  that  excluded  non-completers  and  patients  with  major  protocol deviations.  The  conclusion  of  non-inferiority  of  ATV/RTV  to  LPV/RTV  was  maintained  in  this analysis. Response rates were 338/392 (86%) on ATV/RTV and 332/372 (89%) on LPV/RTV, with a difference estimate (95% CI 3.0 (-7.6, 1.5) (Table 9).

## Treatment outcomes

Treatment outcomes were based on the primary reason for failure through week 48. Virologic failure for HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/ml using CVR (NC = F) was the most frequent reason for not being a responder on both regimens. Most patients with virologic failure were never suppressed through week 48, while 4% on each regimen experienced rebound. Few patients on either regimen discontinued due to death or  adverse events. Fewer patients on ATV/RTV discontinued before achieving confirmed virologic suppression or discontinued while suppressed, primarily due to patients' withdrawal of consent.

a Includes discontinued due to insufficient viral load response, lost to follow-up, other, poor/non compliance, pregnancy, patient no longer meets study criteria, patient withdrew consent, and other.

## Secondary Endpoints

## HIV RNA &lt; 400 c/ml

Most subjects achieved HIV RNA &lt; 400 c/ml by Week 12. Response rates at week 48 ranged from 82% to 96% across regimens, depending on the analysis (see table 7 above). Difference estimates were ≤ 3.8% in magnitude. The treatment outcome of virologic failure using CVR (NC = F) was 6% on both regimens. The 3 subjects who were randomised to LPV/RTV but actually received ATV/RTV were all responders. Two subjects on LPV/RTV achieved re-suppression after rebound. More subjects on LPV/RTV had treatment outcomes of discontinued before achieving confirmed suppression and discontinued  while  suppressed,  which  was  primarily  due  to  subject's  withdrawal  of  consent. Treatment outcomes were consistent using TLOVR.

As was the case for the primary endpoint, the non-inferiority margin of 10% was satisfied. The trend favoured the LPV/RTV group.

## Reduction in log10 HIV RNA from Baseline

Both regimens resulted in HIV RNA mean decreases from baseline of ≥ 2.0 log10 c/ml at weeks 4 and 12, and ≥ 3.0 log10 c/ml at week 24, and this was sustained through week 48. At week 48, the mean  decreases  in  HIV  RNA  were  3.09  and  3.13  log10  c/ml  for  ATV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV, respectively.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  HIV  RNA &lt; 50 c/ml across regimens was 86% (VROC); the limit of quantification (LOQ) of the HIV RNA assay censored the measurement of the actual decline in viral load.

The trend seemed to favour the LPV/RTV group. However, as this was an observed case analysis, it is likely  to  be  biased  against  ATV/RTV,  as  there  were  fewer  drop-outs  in  that  group.  The  primary analysis  of  responders,  where  all  patients  are  included,  was  less  likely  to  be  biased,  and  there  the trend favoured ATV/RTV.

The statistical analysis of the change from baseline at weeks 24 and 48, providing both observed case and  ITT  analysis  is  given  in  table  12.  All  of  the  95%  CIs  contained  0,  supporting  the  comparable effect of the regimens. 2

Difference estimates are stratified by qualifying HIV RNA and region.

2 Note that statistical comparisons of HIV RNA changes from baseline were not pre-planned for Study 138.

1. Unlike CD4 cell count increases, the limit of quantification of the HIV RNA assay censors the measurement of the actual decline in viral load. This 'floor effect' biases results towards patients with higher baseline values.

2. HIV RNA change from baseline is a less clinically relevant endpoint for treatment-naive patients, 70% of whom achieved HIV RNA &lt;50 c/ml by Week 24.

3. The study is overpowered to assess HIV RNA changes, and may identify statistically significant differences between regimens that are not clinically relevant

## CD4 Cell Count Changes from Baseline

The  change  from  baseline  was  calculated  for  each  treatment  group  at  each  time-point.  Statistical analysis was carried out on the change from baseline at weeks 24 and 48 using both the observed data only  as  well  as  using  LOCF  to  impute  data  to  replace  missing  values.    No  formal  test  for  noninferiority was carried out and so no non-inferiority margin was defined.

Difference estimates are stratified by qualifying HIV RNA and region

The  trend  did  not  favour  ATV/RTV  when  considering  change  from  baseline  in  CD4  count.  The analysis  of  observed  data  shows  the  larger  differences,  but  this  is  likely  to  be  biased  as  patients withdrawing before week 48, many due to virologic failure, were not included. The analysis using LOCF which accounts for all patients shows smaller differences. The differences in CD4 counts were not considered to be of an important magnitude.

## Resistance

No  patient  on  ATV/RTV  who  had  wild-type  virus  at  baseline  and  who  subsequently  experienced virologic failure developed resistance. Among patients with virologic failure on ATV/RTV, emerging PI substitutions were observed only in those who entered the study with pre-existing PI substitutions.

Genotypic and phenotypic resistance profiles were determined for patients who had virologic failure through week 48 for HIV RNA ≥ 400 c/ml. Virologic failure was defined using CVR (NC = F) as virologic  rebound  without  re-suppression,  never  suppressed  and  on  study  through  week  48,  or discontinuation due to insufficient viral load response before week 48.

Six  percent  of  patients  had  virologic  failure  through  48  weeks  on  both  regimens  (27/440  on ATV/RTV, 26/443 on LPV/RTV). Baseline genotypes were available for 25/27 ATV/RTV patients and  22/26  LPV/RTV  patients.  International  AIDS  Society  (IAS)-defined  minor  substitutions  were present in 25/25 and 22/22 baseline isolates of ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV virologic failure patients, respectively.

IAS-defined major PI substitutions M46I, V82A, I84V, and L90M were observed in baseline isolates of  only  2  patients  with  virologic  failure.  Both  were  randomised  to  ATV/RTV.  One  of  these  had  2 major PI substitutions at baseline, V82A and L90M; the other had 3 major PI substitutions at baseline, M46I,  I84V  and  L90M.  Both  had ≥ 5  additional  minor  substitutions  associated  with  ATV/RTV resistance,  and  phenotypic  resistance  to  multiple  PIs,  including  ATV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV,  plus phenotypic resistance to FTC, and in one case, TDF.

No patient on either regimen with virologic failure who had a wild-type isolate at baseline developed resistance.  The  ATV-related  major  PI  resistance  substitution,  I50L,  emerged  in  1  patient  on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ATV/RTV. This patient had a baseline isolate that was phenotypically resistant to ATV/RTV (fold change  [FC]  =  19),  LPV/RTV  (FC  =  39),  FTC  (FC  &gt;  43.75)  and  TDF  (FC  =  1.74).  The  baseline isolate had 2 major and 6 minor PI substitutions, 2 thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs), and the M184V substitution.

Phenotypic resistance to ATV/RTV emerged in an isolate from 1 patient treated with ATV/RTV. This isolate  had  5  minor  PI  substitutions  at  baseline,  including  4  associated  with  ATV/RTV  resistance (M36I, I62V, A71A/T, and I93L), plus 4 other polymorphisms. Phenotypic resistance to LPV/RTV did not emerge in isolates from any ATV/RTV patient with virologic failure; however resistance to other PIs emerged in isolates from 4/18 patients. Phenotypic resistance to LPV/RTV or ATV/RTV

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was not observed in the on-study isolates from patients with virologic failure on LPV/RTV; however, resistance to other PIs did emerge in isolates from 4/16 LPV/RTV virologic failure patients.

## Conclusion and Discussion on Clinical Efficacy

This  study  was  an  open  label  study  because  a  double  blind,  double  dummy  design  would  have imposed  a  high  pill  burden  that  might  have  altered  the  study  enrolment.  A  stringent  10%  non inferiority margin (in terms of percentage of patients with undetectable viral load (&lt;50 copies/ml) was used, which is appropriate.  The chosen endpoint of proportions of patients with HIV RNA levels &lt; 50  c/ml  is  the  currently  recommended  endpoint  in  HIV-1  trials  evaluating  compounds  for  the treatment of treatment-naïve patients infected with HIV-1. In addition, this study will provide long term data at 96 weeks as recommended in the guideline. The MAH has committed to submit the 96 weeks study report in the first quarter of 2009.

In line with the pivotal study 45 in antiretroviral experienced patients, TDF was part of the backbone therapy.  As  tenofovir  has  been shown to reduce ATV AUC (25%) and Cmin (40%), the choice of backbone  could  mitigate  the  efficacy  of  ATV.  Nevertheless,  this  backbone  is  attractive  in  clinical practice as a once daily combination for combination ARV treatment.

The per protocol population (PPP) analysis taking into account protocol deviations, in underlined the demonstrated non inferiority result in the 'as randomised' population.

The results for the MAH's selected populations were compatible with the predefined non inferiority margin (-10%). The most borderline situation is observed with the VR-OC, which is expected to be a close  to  a  per  protocol  population  (patients  truly  receiving  the  randomised  treatment  during  48 weeks).

It  is  noteworthy  that  2  antiretroviral  naïve  patients  in  the  ATV/RTV  arm  were  apparently  infected with  circulating  resistant  strains.  These  patients  had  major  PI  substitutions  at  baseline,  including M46I, V82A, I84V, and L90M. Both also had baseline phenotypic resistance to the study PIs and FTC, and in one case TDF. Both of these patients were randomised to ATV/RTV.

## 1.5 Clinical aspects - Safety

The safety information presented by the MAH to support the use of ATV/RTV as part of HAART regimens in a patient population with no or minimal exposure to prior antiretroviral treatment was based primarily on 2 studies:

- -AI424138 (138): Study 138 compared safety of ATV/RTV to a standard-of-care boosted PI, LPV/RTV in treatment-naïve patients through 48 weeks.
- -AI424089 (089):  Study  089  was  a  supportive  study  that  compared  safety  of  ATV/RTV  to unboosted ATV and provided long-term safety data on the use of ATV/RTV in treatmentnaïve patients through 96 weeks.

Different  backbone  drugs  were  used  in  these  2  studies,  a  fixed-dose  combination  of  tenofovir  and emtricitabine in 138, and stavudine-extended release (XR) and lamivudine in 089.

## Patient exposure

In  138,  a  total  of  878  patients  were  treated;  441  in  ATV/RTV  and  437  in  LPV/RTV.  In  138,  97 patients discontinued through week 48 (39 ATV/RTV, 58 LPV/RTV). Adverse Events (AEs) were the most common reason for discontinuation on both treatment regimens (10 ATV/RTV, 14 LPV/RTV). More patients on ATV/RTV discontinued due to jaundice/hyperbilirubinemia (3 [&lt;1%] vs. 0), while more patients on LPV/RTV discontinued due to diarrhoea (4 [&lt;1%] vs. 0).

In  089,  200 patients  were  randomised;  199  patients  were  treated  (95 ATV/RTV,  104  ATV400). Twenty-one (21) patients discontinued through week 48, in addition, 14 patients discontinued on or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

after week 48 visit and prior to week 96 visit. Discontinuation due to AEs through week 96 was more common for patients in the ATV/RTV than ATV400 regimen (8 patients vs. 3 patients); 5 of these discontinuations in ATV/RTV regimen were protocol mandated (for persistent Grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia and abnormal blood bilirubin).

## Characteristics of study population

In  the  pooled  ATV/RTV  population,  median  age  of  all  randomised  patients  was  34  years,  and majority  of  patients  were  males  (69%).  The  most  common  race  was  white  (48%),  and  the  most common region was South America (43%). Patients' gender, age, race, and region were consistent between studies.

Co-infection :  In  138,  60  (14%)  patients  in  ATV/RTV  and  51  (12%)  in  LPV/RTV  and  in  089,  17 (18%) in ATV/RTV and 20 (19%) in ATV400 regimen were HBV and/or HCV positive at baseline.

Most patients in both studies had normal liver function tests at baseline. In the ATV/RTV regimen, Grade 1 to 2 elevations  in  ALT  were observed in 14% (138) and 16% (089) of patients and AST elevations were observed in 18% (138) and 12% (089) of patients at baseline. In 138, &lt; 1% patients and in 089 no patients had Grade 3 to 4 ALT/AST abnormalities at baseline. In 089, 100% and in 138, &gt; 99% patients had normal total bilirubin at baseline.

In both studies, fasting lipids at baseline were categorised by NCEP (National Cholesterol Education Program) guidelines as desirable or optimal.

The median fasting glucose values at baseline in both studies were consistent between regimens (138: 84 mg/dl, ATV/RTV; 86 mg/dl, LPV/RTV and in 089, 86 mg/dl ATV/RTV; 86 mg/dl, ATV400).

## Adverse events

## All adverse events

In 138, the overall incidence of AEs of any grade through week 48 was 91% on both ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV  regimens.  The  majority  of  AEs  of  any  grade  occurred  in  &lt;  1%  of  patients  in  either regimen. Treatment-related AEs through week 48 were 61% and 70% in ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV, respectively. Treatment-related AEs that were reported with a higher frequency ( ≥ 5% difference) on the ATV/RTV than LPV/RTV regimen were jaundice (15% vs. &lt; 1%), hyperbilirubinemia (10% vs. 0), and ocular icterus (8% vs. 0).

Treatment-related  AEs  that  occurred  with  a  lower  frequency  on  the  ATV/RTV  than  LPV/RTV regimen included diarrhoea (11% vs. 46%), nausea (15% vs. 22%), and hypertriglyceridaemia (2% vs. 8%).  Renal toxicity was 2% on each regimen.

In  the  pooled  ATV/RTV  population  from  138  and  089  (N  =  536),  through  week  48,  most  (91%) patients reported at least 1 AE regardless of relationship to ATV/RTV or the comparator regimens. The most frequently reported ( ≥ 10%) treatment-related AEs (all grades) were jaundice (16%), nausea (15%), diarrhoea (12%), ocular icterus (11%), and hyperbilirubinemia (10%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Grade 2 to Grade 4 adverse events

In 138, through week 48, the overall incidence of Grade 2 to 4 AEs was 57% for ATV/RTV, and 59% for LPV/RTV, and 26% and 30%, respectively for Grade 2 to 4 treatment-related AEs.

- Hepatobiliary AEs: Hyperbilirubinemia was the only Grade 2 to 4 treatment-related AE (6% and 0%) that occurred with a higher frequency ( ≥ 5 % difference) on the ATV/RTV than LPV/RTV regimen,
- Gastrointestinal AEs: Diarrhoea was the only Grade 2 to 4 treatment-related AE (2% and 11%) that  occurred  with  a  lower  frequency  ( ≥ 5  %  difference)  on  the  ATV/RTV  than  LPV/RTV regimen,
- Metabolism and nutrition AEs: Grade 2 to 4 treatment-related hypertriglyceridaemia was higher in the LPV/RTV (4% vs. &lt; 1%),
- Rash  AEs:  The  incidence  of  these  Grade  2  to  4  AEs  was  consistent  in  the  ATV/RTV  and LPV/RTV regimens (3% and 2%, respectively).

In  089,  the  overall  incidence  of  treatment-related  Grade  2  to  4  AEs  through  week  48  for  the ATV/RTV regimen, was 43% versus 36% for the ATV400 regimen. Treatment-related Grade 2 to 4 AEs reported with higher frequency ( ≥ 5% difference) in the ATV/RTV than ATV400 regimen were hyperbilirubinemia  and  increased  blood  bilirubin.  Through  week  96  in  089,  the  incidence  rate  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment-related Grade 2 to 4 AEs for the ATV/RTV regimen was 48% and for ATV400 was 39%. Hyperbilirubinemia was the only Grade 2 to 4 AE and treatment-related AE (15% vs. 7%) reported more frequently in the ATV/RTV than ATV400 regimen.

Overall, the pattern of AEs seen in 138 and 089 was as expected and consistent with the known safety profile of ATV/RTV. No unexpected Grade 2 to 4 AEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, were apparent from the two studies submitted by the MAH.

## Deaths and Discontinuations due to adverse events

## Deaths

In 138, 13 deaths were reported: 6 on ATV/RTV; 6 on LPV/RTV; 1 additional enrolled patient was hospitalised  prior  to  randomisation  and  subsequently  died.  One  (1)  death  on  LPV/RTV  (case  of mesenteric thrombosis) was considered 'possibly related' to study drug; all others were considered 'unrelated' or 'not likely' related to study drug.

There  were  2  deaths  in  089,  both  in  patients  on  the  ATV400  regimen  and  were  judged  by  the investigators to be not related to study drug. One (1) patient died of head injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident and the other patient died of metastatic lung cancer after discontinuation from the study prior to week 96.

## Discontinuations due to adverse events

In  138  through  week  48,  11  (2%)  patients  in  ATV/RTV  and  15  (3%)  in  LPV/RTV  discontinued therapy because of AEs. All individual AEs leading to discontinuation occurred with an incidence of &lt; 1%. Events leading to discontinuation in both regimens were consistent with the known side effect profiles  of  the  study  drugs  and  comparison/backbone  treatments.  More  patients  on  ATV/RTV discontinued due to jaundice/hyperbilirubinemia (3 [&lt;1%] vs. 0), while more patients on LPV/RTV discontinued due to diarrhoea (4 [&lt;1%] vs. 0). The proportion of patients who discontinued due to rash  (&lt;  1%  and  &lt;  1%)  and  rash  generalised  (&lt;  1%  and  0)  was  consistent  between  the  treatment regimens.

In 089, 8 (8%) patients discontinued in ATV/RTV and 3 (3%) discontinued in the ATV400 regimen because  of  AEs.  Five  (5)  of  these  discontinuations  from  the  ATV/RTV  regimen  were  protocol mandated due to persistent bilirubin elevations.

## Analysis of Safety by Organ System

## Hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice

In  138  through  week  48,  AEs  of  ocular  icterus, hyperbilirubinemia, and jaundice (all grades) were more common on ATV/RTV than LPV/RTV (31% vs. 1%) ; the most frequently reported Grade 2 to 4 treatment-related AEs that were higher in ATV/RTV than LPV/RTV were hyperbilirubinemia (7% vs. &lt; 1%) and jaundice (4% vs. 0%).

Similar to 138, in 089 through week 48, more patients in ATV/RTV than in ATV400 (52% vs. 31%, respectively)  experienced  1  or  more  AEs  (all  grades)  of  ocular  icterus,  hyperbilirubinemia,  and jaundice.  In  138,  mean  total  bilirubin  levels  at  week  48  in  ATV/RTV  were  1.9  mg/dl  and  in LPV/RTV were 0.5 mg/dl. Mean changes from baseline in total bilirubin levels through week 48 were higher in ATV/RTV than in LPV/RTV (1.5 mg/dl and 0.1 mg/dl, respectively).

For all cohorts and for all grades (i.e. Grade 3 to 4 and Grade 4), the majority of cases of bilirubin elevation were total bilirubin measures (predominantly unconjugated bilirubin). This observation, in combination  with  the  lack  of  reported  clinical  sequelae  (i.e.,  liver  failure)  for  those  patients  with concurrent bilirubin and transaminase elevations are consistent with previous safety analyses of ATV.

## Adverse Events by Hepatitis B or C Co-infection

In  138,  60  (14%)  patients  in  ATV/RTV  and  51  (12%)  in  LPV/RTV  and  in  089,  17  (18%)  in ATV/RTV and 20 (19%) in ATV400 regimen were HBV and/or HCV positive at baseline.

The Grade 3 to 4 AST/ALT and total bilirubin abnormalities in both 138 and 089 through week 48 are summarised in the table below:

| Total Bilirubin | 38%                 | 33%                      | 0%                  | < 1%                     | 53%                 | 60%                     | 25%                 | 19%                     |

As expected, co-infected patients experienced higher baseline and on-treatment hepatic transaminase levels than those not co-infected. In 138, patients on both ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV who had HBV and/or HCV co-infection had higher rates of liver enzyme elevations than the not co-infected patients.

Higher rates of Grade 3-4 ALT and AST elevations were observed in the ATV/RTV arm compared to the LPV/RTV one in the combined group. Randomisation was not stratified by HBV/HCV status in the study, making results within these subgroups susceptible to bias.

To determine whether a specific co-infection subgroup might provide further insight into the clinical relevance  of  the  observed  differences,  Grade  3-4  liver  function  elevations  through  Week  48  were determined by regimen separately for baseline HBV and HCV co infected patients:

- Grade  3-4  AST  elevations  were  higher  on  ATV/RTV  than  LPV/RTV  for  both  HBV  and  HCV patients. On ATV/RTV, rates were 3/24 (13%) for HBV patients and 3/39 (8%) for HCV patients. Rates were 0% on LPV/RTV for both subgroups.
- Grade  3-4  ALT  elevations  were  higher  on  ATV/RTV  than  LPV/RTV  for  HBV  patients:  4/24 (17%) versus 1/19 (5%). Rates were consistent between regimens for HCV patients: 2/39 (5%) versus 2/33 (6%).

This variety of potential causes (inflammation as a result of immune reconstitution and inflammatory syndrome, drug-induced hepatocellular toxicity, or 'flares' due to the antiviral effect of tenofovir and emtricitabine), in addition to the susceptibility to bias noted above, makes it difficult to assess, in the small  numbers  of  co-infected  patients  seen  in  study  138,  if  the  differences  observed  between  the regimens, particularly for AST, are of any clinical relevance.

## Lipodystrophy related adverse events

In 138, few (&lt; 1% in both regimens) lipodystrophy-related AEs were reported through week 48. Only acquired lipodystrophy was reported in the ATV/RTV regimens (1 patient); acquired lipodystrophy, lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy were reported in the LPV/RTV regimen (1 patient for each event). All  lipodystrophy-related  AEs  were  non-serious AEs. One (1) AE of acquired lipodystrophy in the LPV/RTV  regimen  resulted  in  discontinuation  after  333  days  of  dosing;  this  Grade  2  AE  was considered certainly related to study drug by the investigator.

In 089, 2% and 3% of patients on ATV/RTV and ATV400, respectively had lipodystrophy-acquired reported  as  an  AE;  3%  and  2%  respectively  had  lipoatrophy  reported  through  week  48.  The  most common lipodystrophy-related AEs through both week 48 and week 96 were lipoatrophy (3% to 6%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and 2% to 4%, respectively) and acquired lipodystrophy (2% to 3% and 3% to 5%, respectively). All lipodystrophy-related AEs were non-serious AEs and none resulted in treatment discontinuation.

A lipodystrophy substudy was planned in study 138 to compare the changes in body fat redistribution between ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV treatment regimens, as assessed by the change from baseline in trunk-to-limb  fat  ratio  measured  by  Dual  Energy  Xray  Absorptiometry  (DEXA)  at  week  96.  This substudy report will be submitted 3 rd quarter 2009.

Immune reconstitution syndrome adverse events

In  138,  immune reconstitution syndrome AEs were uncommon (27/878), fourteen (14) events (3%) were reported in the ATV/RTV and 13 (3%) in the LPV/RTV regimen. The most frequently reported events  were  hepatitis  flare  (6  events),  Kaposi  Sarcoma  (5  events)  and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (3 events). Among the 27 patients with an immune reconstitution syndrome event, 5 patients discontinued therapy on or before week 48 and 3 patients discontinued after week 48. Six (6) of the 8 discontinuations occurred among patients on the LPV/RTV regimen and the remaining 2 occurred in the ATV/RTV regimen. In 138, there was only 1 spontaneous investigator reported serious adverse event  (SAE)  of  immune  reconstitution  syndrome.  This  SAE  was  reported  for  1  patient  in  the LPV/RTV regimen.

In 089, immune reconstitution syndrome was not reported as an AE for any patients.

## Renal toxicity adverse events

Renal  toxicity  AEs  were  uncommon  ( ≤ 2%)  and  consistent  between  ATV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV regimen. All renal toxicity AEs occurred with an incidence of &lt; 1%. One (1) patient on each regimen discontinued due to a renal AE, Fanconi syndrome on ATV/RTV and proteinuria on LPV/RTV. There were  2  cases  (&lt;  1%)  of  nephrolithiasis  on  ATV/RTV  and  1  (&lt;  1%)  on  LPV/RTV;  all  3  were considered non-serious AEs.

Grade 3 to Grade 4 creatinine was reported in only 1 subject on each regimen. Only 1 subject on ATV/RTV and 3 subjects on LPV/RTV required substitution using alternative NRTIs for TDF-FTC through Week 48. Renal function was stable overall with no change from baseline in the mean serum creatinine  at  Week  48  on  either  regimen.  The  overall  calculated  creatinine  clearance  appeared  to fluctuate over time: the median percent changes were -6% and -7% at Week 4 on the ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV regimens, respectively, and returned toward baseline values by Week 48, at -1% for both regimens.

Currently, the ATV SPC mentions that when TDF 300mg is co-administered with ATV 300mg and ritonavir 100mg, an increase in concentrations of TDF was observed (increase in AUC of 37% with 90%  confidence  interval  (30-45%)).  Higher  TDF  concentrations  could  potentiate  TDF-associated adverse events, including renal disorders. Patients receiving ATV and TDF should be monitored for TDF associated adverse events.

## Fasting lipid abnormalities

In clinical studies, ATV (with or without RTV), has been shown to induce dyslipidaemia to a lesser extent  than  LPV/RTV.  The  data  available  from  study  138  on  the  lipid  profile  (mean  change  from baseline) are described  in treatment-naïve  subjects  (Table  19);  historical  data  for  treatmentexperienced subjects (study 045) are reflected in Table 20.

Overall,  these  data  suggest  that  ATV/RTV  is  associated  with  a  less  negative  lipid  profile  than LPV/RTV. However, a clinical study to prove the benefit of these laboratory parameter findings in a cardiovascular  outcome  was  found  to  be  too  extensive  to  perform  (forecasted  duration  ca.  8 years, enrolment ca. 8,000 patients). As such, the potential clinical benefit remains unproven.

## Fasting glucose abnormalities

In both studies, through week 48, Grade 3 to 4 fasting glucose abnormalities were infrequent ( ≤ 1%) among treatment regimens. week 96 results in 089 were consistent with those for week 48.

## Other observations related to safety

Collection of ECGs was not required in either 138 or 089; however, there were no episodes of PR interval  or  QT  prolongation  reported  as  AEs.  Patients  with  known  cardiac  abnormalities  were excluded from both studies.

## Conclusion on safety:

The safety profile with the addition of data for treatment-naïve patients available from 138 and 089 to the integrated safety database for the proposed SPC is consistent with the current SPC. No new safety signals were identified for ATV/RTV than previously observed. The pattern of adverse events was consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  ATV/RTV,  LPV/RTV  and  the  backbone  medicines, TDF/FTC. The overall discontinuation numbers and reasons for discontinuation were consistent with previous studies.

Overall, discontinuations due to adverse events prior to week 48 were 2% and 3% on ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV, respectively. The majority of liver function test abnormalities were mild to moderate, with an incidence of 2% and 1% Grade 3 to Grade 4 ALT for ATV/RTV and LPV/RTV, respectively. As expected, the incidence of abnormal bilirubin was greater on ATV/RTV than LPV/RTV (Grade 1 to Grade 4: 84% and 4%; Grade 3 to Grade 4: 34% and &lt;1%).

The higher frequency of liver enzyme elevations for co-infected patients in the ATV/RTV arm vs. LPV/RTV: 8% vs. 6% for ALT elevation and 8% vs. 0% for AST elevation was most likely due to the small  number  of  co-infected  patients  in  the  study,  which  do  not  allow  for  a  relevant  statistical comparison between both arms for this population.

Renal  toxicity  AEs  were  uncommon  ( ≤ 2%)  and  consistent  between  ATV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV regimen. All renal toxicity AEs occurred with an incidence of &lt; 1%. One (1) patient on each regimen discontinued due to a renal AE, Fanconi syndrome on ATV/RTV and proteinuria on LPV/RTV. There were  2  cases  (&lt;  1%)  of  nephrolithiasis  on  ATV/RTV  and  1  (&lt;  1%)  on  LPV/RTV;  all  3  were considered non-serious AEs.

The use of PI-based highly active ARV treatment has been associated with dyslipidaemia. Clinical data suggest that ATV/RTV is associated with a less negative lipid profile than LPV/RTV. However, a  clinical  study  to  prove  the  benefit  of  these  laboratory  parameter  findings  in  a  cardiovascular outcome  was  found  to  be  too  extensive  to  perform  (forecasted  duration  ca.  8 years,  enrolment  ca. 8,000 patients). As such, the potential clinical benefit remains unproven.

## 1.6 Risk Management Plan

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  MAH  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

The  CHMP did  not  require  the  MAH  to  submit  an  updated  risk  management  plan  because  it  had recently  been  assessed  in  the  framework  of  the  line  extension  for  ATV  300  mg  hard  capsule (EMEA/H/C/494/X/33) and was judged acceptable. No further changes were deemed necessary.

## 1.7 Changes to the Product Information

## Summary of Product Characteristics

## Section 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3

Changes to reflect the new patient populations were introduced in sections 4.1 and 4.2. In section 4.3 'should' was exchanged for 'must' in order to avoid translation ambiguity.

## Section 4.4 'Special warnings and precautions for use'

A  statement  underling  the  risk  of  developing  dyslipidaemia  under  HAART,  including  ATV  was added.

## Section 4.5 'Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction'

This section was updated with data from study 138 in relation to the co-administration of both RTV and TDF with ATV.

## Section 4.8 'Undesirable Effects'

This section was updated in the light of safety finding from study 138 and 089, which led to some changes in frequency categories for listed ADRs.

## Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

This section was extensively updated in order to reflect both the findings relating to clinical outcome as well as resistance in treatment naïve patients. In addition, the section on lipid parameters was taken out,  as  the  clinical  benefit  in  terms  of  cardiovascular  outcome  for  patients  cannot  be  proven. Therefore, these data might be falsely reassuring.

## Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The  paragraphs  on  absorption,  food  effect  and  elimination  were  updated  in  order  to  include  the findings in the treatment naïve population.

## Package Leaflet

The section on possible side effects was updated in line with the update in section 4.8.

Generally, the Product Information was revised in an effort to consistently use British spelling.

## 1.8 Discussion and Benefit Risk Assessment

Given the once daily dosing possibility of ATV, the extension of indication to include the treatment of  antiretroviral  naïve  patients  is  of  interest,  especially  in  view  of  potential  benefit  in  terms  of adherence to long-term treatment.

ATV was originally (2004) developed as an unboosted regimen (400 mg QD) in antiretroviral naïve patients in a study where it was compared to efavirenz.  Due to methodological problems this study failed to provide a convincing non inferiority demonstration of ATV unboosted to efavirenz (with an ultra-sensitive  test  of  50  copies/ml  (secondary  endpoint  in  the  study)  it  was  even  shown  as  being inferior).    From  the  beginning of the assessment it was identified that an unboosted regimen might provide suboptimal PK exposure in some patients. The MAH has performed a study AI424 089 that consisted of a comparison between the unboosted and boosted regimen of ATV (two non validated arms in the target population for an EU perspective). This study confirmed the CHMP concerns that, from a clinical and PK point of view, the unboosted regimen might be suboptimal.

The MAH subsequently performed study 138 to support the extension of indication in antiretroviral naïve patients in the EU with ATV boosted with ritonavir 300/100 mg QD, this treatment is currently recommended for treatment experienced patients.

This study was an open label study, which is regretful. However, it has to be recognised that a double blind,  double  dummy  would  have  imposed  a  high  pill  burden  (5  BID)  that  might  have  altered  the study  enrolment.  The  stringent  10%  non  inferiority  margin  in  terms  of  percentage  of  patients  with undetectable  viral  load  (&lt;50  copies/ml)  was  used,  which  is  appreciated.    Its  long  term  data  at  96 weeks will be submitted in the first quarter of 2009.

In line with the pivotal study 45 in antiretroviral experienced patients, TDF was part of the backbone therapy. To some extent this might somewhat mitigate the efficacy of ATV. Indeed, TDF has been shown to reduce the ATV AUC (25%) and Cmin (40%) whereas no significant influence has been observed  on  lopinavir  exposure.    Nevertheless  this  backbone  is  attractive  in  clinical  practice  and allows the MAH to fulfil the specific obligation consisting of exploring the use of ATV in a once daily HAART combination.

As a main finding,  the  results  observed  are  well  in  accordance  with  the  predefined  non  inferiority margin for this study.

For both treatment arms the response rate was lower (10%) in patients with a higher viral load (&gt;100 000 copies/ml) as compared to patients with viral load &lt;100 000 copies/ml.  A similar 3 log copies/ml viral load decrease was observed in both treatment arms.  No major concern was raised as regards the emergence of resistance.

No  major  safety  issue  was  raised  in  this  population  of  patients  as  compared  to  the  antiretroviral experienced patients.  A trend for a lower rate of dyslipidaemia was observed, however the translation of  this  laboratory  parameter  effect  into  a  clinical  benefit  (i.e.  cardiovascular  outcome)  will  remain unproven, as a study in support of such an outcome would be unrealistically long and large.

Hyperbilirubinemia was observed but not perceived as a significant limiting factor of the use of the medicinal product (accounts for &lt;1 % of adverse events leading discontinuation). A higher rate of hyperbilirubinemia and a lower rate of diarrhoea as compared to lopinavir/ritonavir were observed.

## CONCLUSION

On 24 April 2008 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.
