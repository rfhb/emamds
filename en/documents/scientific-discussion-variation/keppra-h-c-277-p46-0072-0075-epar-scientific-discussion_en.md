## I. RECOMMENDATION

The CHMP noted the submission of two paediatric studies  in  accordance  with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, hereafter referred to as Paediatric Regulation,  and  confirmeds  that  there  was  no  impact  on  either  the  Product Information  or  on  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  the  EU  authorised  formulations  of Keppra.

## II. INTRODUCTION

This assessment report concerns two study reports submitted under Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation. Both studies are open-label, single-arm, multi-centre studies  which  investigated  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  adjunctive  treatment  with levetiracetam in Japanese paediatric patients ≥ 4 to &lt;16 years) with uncontrolled generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures despite treatment with 1 or 2 antiepileptic drug(s).

Levetiracetam (LEV) dry syrup, a formulation (approved for use in Japan in June 2013) developed for use in Japan for children and in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets, is not a registered formulation in the EU, so no changes to the  approved  EU  Product  Information  for  Keppra  are  proposed  following  the completion  of  this  study.  At  this  time,  the  MAH  considers  that  the  standard immediate  release  formulations  of  Keppra  allow  for  appropriate  use  of  LEV  in paediatric patients in the EU.

## III. STUDIES

## III.1 Study N01223

## III.1.1  Introduction

Study N01223 was an open label multicentre trial, using but a single arm, with the goal of investigating the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam used as adjunctive therapy in Japanese paediatric patients equal to  or  older  than  4  and  younger  than  16  years  of  age  whom  have  uncontrolled partial seizures despite treatment with 1 or 2 anti-epileptic drug(s).

A total 30 investigators in 30 centres participated, all located in Japan.

The study consisted of two periods, the first one taking 28 weeks to complete, including an 8 week baseline period, and 4 week up-titration period, a 10 week evaluation period and a 6 week withdrawal period. Patients whom had finished the  first  period  were  eligible  to  participate  in  the  second  in  order  to  continue receiving Keppra until market approval.

## III.1.2  Objectives

## First Period

- Primary: To evaluate the efficacy of Levetiracetam (LEV) dry syrup at doses up to a maximum of 60mg/kg/day (or 3000mg/day if ≥ 50 kilograms) if used as  an  adjunctive  therapy  in  Japanese  paediatric  subjects ≥ 4  to  &lt;16

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

years old with uncontrolled partial seizures despitetreatment with 1 or 2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

- Secondary: To evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of LEV dry syrup (up to 60mg/kg/day or 3000mg/day if ≥ 50 kgs).

## Second Period

- Primary:  Provide  LEV  to  willing  subjects  deemed  to  benefit  from  long-term treatment.

Continuous evaluation of the safety of long-term LEV administration at doses  from  20mg/kg/day  (1000mg/day  if ≥ 50  kgs)  to  60mg/kg/day (3000mg/day if ≥ 50 kgs).

- Secondary: Continuous evaluation of the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of longterm  administration  of  LEV  at  doses  ranging  from  20mg/kg/day  to 60mg/kg/day or 1000mg/day to 3000mg/day if ≥ 50 kgs.

## III.1.3  Study Methodology

The  study  was  an  open-label,  single-arm,  multi-center  study  consisting  of  2 periods  in  Japanese  children ≥ 4  to  &lt;16  years  old  with  uncontrolled  partial seizures despite treatment with 1 or 2 concomitant AED(s). The study consisted of  two  periods,  the  first  one  of  which  took  28  weeks  and  had  4  sub-periods: Baseline, Up-Titration, Evaluation and Withdrawal. This was then followed by a second  period  in  which  participants  of  the  first  period  could  enter  in  order  to continue receiving Keppra until market approval in Japan.

The first period consisted of obtaining the patient's informed consent, checking her/his eligibility, starting the patient on a dose of  20  mg  LEV/KG/day (1000mg/day), followed by a four week up-titration (20mg/kg/day or 1000mg/day for  2  weeks  and  40mg/kg/day or 2000mg/day for 2 weeks). They then entered the Evaluation Period, during which the subjects received LEV 60mg/kg/day or 3000mg/day for 10 weeks, and the investigators were permitted to decrease the dose  to  40mg/kg/day  or  2000mg/day  once  if  any  issues  in  tolerability  were confirmed When the subject or investigator decided to stop treatment, the dose was gradually decreased at rate of 20mg/kg/day (1000mg/day if over 50kg) every two weeks. Two weeks after the last dose a final visit was to take place, where it would also be decided if continuing treatment in period 2 would be beneficial of not.

After patients were admitted to the second period they began individualized LEV treatment based on the dose they had received at the end of the evaluation subperiod of the first treatment period. Those subjects with a body weight over 20 kilograms were allowed to change their received formulation to tablets or back again  at  any  time  during  this  period.  As  long  as  concomitant  AED  had  been stable for at least 4 weeks, the investigators were allowed to change dose and mode of administration of LEV and AED administered to patients. Introduction of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AEDs  other  than  those  taken  already  during  the  first  period  was  forbidden. Discontinuation  during  this  period  was  done  at  a  rate  of  10mg/kg/day  to 20mg/kg/day or 500mg/day to 1000mg/day (if bodyweight ≥ 50kg) every 2 weeks.

In the protocol a total of 70 subjects was planned to be randomized (As this study was aimed to confirm the clinical efficacy of LEV in Japanese paediatric patients and seeing that study N159 demonstrated the superiority of LEV against placebo treatment, the latter's  estimate  methodology was used to establish the  needed sample size for this study), with a total of 73 patients being entered into the first period and receiving at least one dose of LEV in practice. Of these 73 subjects 62  completed  the  first  period  and  eventually  55  of  these  entered  the  second period.

## III.1.4  Exclusion and Inclusion Criteria

Only subjects between 4 and 16 years of age, with a bodyweight of 11 kilograms or above, but below 82 kilograms, with uncontrolled partial seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized which had been diagnosed and confirmed at least 6 months before the first visit could participate. In addition, subjects had to have been experiencing at least 4 partial seizures during the 4 weeks prior to visit 1, and  have  at  least  4  partial  seizures  during  the  first  and  last  4  weeks  of  the baseline period. The subject had to be on a stable AED treatment consisting of no more than 2 AEDs during the 4 weeks prior to visit 1 and AED treatments could  not  be  changed  during  baseline,  up-titration  and  evaluation  sub-periods, while outright deletion or addition of AEDs were forbidden during the entire study.

In order to be eligible for the second study period, the subject in question had to have completed the first period and deemed needing to be continuously treated with LEV by the investigators.

A history of status epilepticus in the 3 months preceding visit 1, having treatable seizure etiology, having epilepsy secondary to a progressive cerebral disease or any other progressively neurodegenerative disease, uncountable seizures due to clustering, pseudo seizures, having Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, progressive CNS or  psychiatric  disorders,  clinically  significant  acute/chronic/terminal  illnesses, conditions  that  might  interfere  with  study  protocol  adherence  or  medicine metabolisation,  being  on  a  ketogenic  diet  and  having  a  known  allergy  to pyrrolidone derivatives or a history of multiple drug allergies were all reasons to be denied entry into the study population.

## III.1.5  Endpoints

## First period

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  percentage  reduction  from  baseline  in partial seizure frequencies per week during the treatment period (up-titration and evaluation).

The most important secondary efficacy variables were:

- The  percentage  reduction  in  partial  seizure  frequency  per  week  from Baseline over the Evaluation Period

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Partial seizure frequency per week over the Treatment Period
- Partial seizure frequency per week over the Evaluation Period
- Partial seizures 50% responder rate (the proportion of subjects with 50% or more reduction from Baseline in the frequency of partial epileptic seizures) over the Treatment Period
- Partial seizures 50% responder rate (the proportion of subjects with 50% or more reduction from Baseline in the frequency of partial epileptic seizures) over the Evaluation Period
- Seizure freedom over the Treatment Period
- Seizure freedom over the Evaluation Period
- Levetiracetam plasma concentrations throughout the study
- Adverse events (AEs)
- Laboratory assessments, including blood chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis
- Electrocardiograms (ECGs)
- Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature)
- Body weight and height

## Second period

The primary variable was the incidence of AEs over the Second Period.

The most important secondary variables collected were:

- The incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) over the Second Period
- The  percentage  reduction  from  Baseline  in  partial  seizure  frequency  per week by 3-month windows over the evaluation period in the second period (excluding the withdrawal period)

Important deviations, which led to exclusion from the efficacy analysis, were reported by 3 subjects (4.1%). Of the 3 subjects, 1 subject was partially excluded from the PPS and 2 subjects were totally excluded. The former reported a deviation for the use for restricted concomitant medication and rescue medications at Visit 7, which led to the data for this subject after Visit 7 to be excluded from the efficacy analysis in the PPS. One subject used restricted concomitant medications Prior to the first dose of LEV treatment at Visit 3, and another used the rescue medications at Visit 3. Therefore, the data for these 2 subjects were totally excluded from the PPS. No subjects reported protocol deviations for subject eligibility in efficacy.

## III.1.7  Efficacy Results

The primary efficacy endpoint, the median percentage reduction from baseline in partial seizures per week during the 14-week treatment period attained 43.21% (26.19  &lt;  95%CI  &lt;  52.14%),  which  meant  that  the  predefined  criterion  for  a positive efficacy result (the lower limit of the 95% CI at greater than 16.3%, the median percentage reduction of the seizure frequency per week of the subjects in  the  placebo  group  of  a  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter  study (N159)) was met.

During the Up-Titration Period, the subjects received LEV 20mg/kg/day (1000mg/day if over 50 kgs) for 2 weeks, 40mg/kg/day (2000mg/day if over 50 kgs) for 2 weeks, and then started 60mg/kg/day (3000mg/day) if tolerability was confirmed.  The  median  percentage  reduction  in  seizure  frequency  during  this sub-period was 32.87%. The median percentage reduction at each visit from visit 4 until  visit  8  ranged  between  37.05  and 44.39%, with the reduction in seizure frequency appearing to be sustained over time.

The seizure  frequency  per  week  was  3.50  at  Visit  4  when  LEV  treatment  had started,  compared  to  6.25  at  Visit  3  prior  to  LEV  treatment.  The  reduction  in seizure frequency was seen at the time of the initial LEV dose of 20mg/kg/day and the percentage reduction appeared to be sustained over time.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The median percentage reduction in seizure frequency during the second period was  41.32%,  closely  mirroring  the  percentage  seen  in  the  first  period.  The efficacy of LEV treatment was shown to be sustained over time as an adjunctive therapy in a long term use.

The  percentage  reduction  in  seizure  frequency  per  week  and  actual  seizure frequency seen in period 2 is summarized in table 14. There were no subjects who were seizure free during the Second Period

## III.1.8  Pharmacokinetics/-dynamics - Results

The fact that  all  subjects  received  the  protocol-defined  LEV  dosage  during  the first  period  and  second  period  was  reflected  in  the  observed  LEV  plasma concentrations. During the second period, the doses administered to the subjects were higher than those during the first period, leading to very limited number of concentrations  for  the  10  mg/kg/bid  target  dose  group.  Although  23  subjects (41.8%)  switched  from the dry syrup to the tablets and  the  number  of concentrations  is  lower  during  the  second  period,  the  concentrations  vs  time points  profile  observed  during  the  second  period  was  overall  similar  to  that observed during the first period.

Overall,  the  concentrations  for  both  the  first  period  and  second  period  were below 30μg/mL for the target dose of 10mg/kg/bid, below 50μg/mL for the target dose of 20mg/kg/bid, and below 80μg/mL for the target dose of 30mg/kg/bid. The increase of concentrations seemed to be in proportion to the dose with maximal concentrations  reached  between  1  and  4  hours  post  dose.  The  concentrations subsequently decreased and remained quantifiable for at least 16 hours for each dose.  The  resulting  concentrations  were  within  the  levels  seen  in  previous studies.

## III.1.9  Safety Results

Safety evaluations for periods of +3 years in this study indicated that LEV at the doses provided throughout (20 to 60 mg/kg/day or 1000 to 3000 mg/day if over 50 kilos) was well-tolerated in the subject group studied.

During the whole of the study the mean duration of exposure to LEV was 714.25 (SD = 448.93) days with a mean dose of 47.37mg/kg (SD = 11.42) in 73 subjects. The  total  exposure  to  LEV  throughout  the  study  (expressed  in  days)  and  the mean LEV daily doses are summarised in tables 6 and 7.

- E ADRs are defined as TEAEs except the AEs judged as not related.
- b n=number of subjects reporting at least 1 TEAE in that category.
- This Table covers Treatment Period + Down-Titration Period + Follow-Up Period.

Before treatment start (visit 3), 72 pretreatment adverse events (AEs) were noted in  40  subjects  (54,8%  of  participants)  with  the  most  frequently  reported  ones being nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection (respectively 23.3 and 6.8 percent of subjects), while all other pretreatment AEs had an incidence lower than  2.7%.  Three  pretreatment  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  were  noted, pneumonia, tibia fracture, and convulsion, all which resolved without sequelae.

The most frequently reported ADR was somnolence in 31 subjects (42.5%), that is to say 30 subjects (41.1%) in the first and 2 subjects (3.6%) during the second period. The majority of the ADRs were mild or moderate in intensity. There was only  1  severe  ADR  of  somnolence  during  the  first  period.  The  event  did  not resolve; however, it did not lead to study discontinuation. There was 1 serious ADR of acetonaemic vomiting during the second period. The event was judged

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

by the investigator as unlikely related to LEV and resolved 3 days after the event onset.

The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  nasopharyngitis  in  54  subjects (74.0%), followed by somnolence in 34 subjects (46.6%). The former showed a consistent occurrence pattern across periods with 39.7% and 76.4% of subjects developing this AE during the first and second periods respectively. Somnolence showed  a  marked  drop  off  going  from  the  first  to  second  period,  with  the incidence dropping from 43.8% to 12.7%.

As  stated  earlier,  3  severe  TEAEs  occurred  during  the  study,  a  case  of somnolence during the first period (considered related to LEV, unresolved but the subject continued  study  participation),  and  one  case  of  status  epilepticus (considered  not  related  to  LEV  treatment  and  resolved)  and  another  of  (fatal) near drowning in the second (considered not related to study treatment).

In regards to the fatal near drowning, the cause was considered to be the onset of a seizure while taking a bath, which led to a cardiopulmonary arrest. On the day following the event onset the subject's symptom did not improve despite the treatment and he died.

Over both periods  there  were  14  SEAs  in  8  subjects  (11.0%).  Of  these  1,  the near  drowning,  was  fatal,  as  expounded  upon  earlier,  but  all  other  resolved during the study.

Overall, age and body weight did not appear to influence the incidence of AEs and no trends were noted. All SAEs, other than the status epilepticus and near drowning (TE)AEs, were mild to moderate in intensity. Only one event, namely conversion  disorder,  led  to  study  discontinuation  while  all  other  SAEs  did  not require changes in LEV doses.

A total of 7 subjects (9.6%) discontinued LEV treatment due to 8 TEAEs, with 4 subjects (5.5%) leaving the study during the first period and 3 subjects (5.5%) doing so during the second.

The  clinical  laboratory  evaluations  did  not  indicate  any  clinically  significant changes,  though  there  were  parameters  in  hematology,  blood  chemistry,  and vital signs that indicated possibly clinically significant (PCS) values. Nevertheless, the incidence of each parameter was relatively low and no trends to increase or decrease from the baseline values were noted.

The high incidences of treatment-emergent PCS values in body weight (too low) were reported as 24.7% in the first and 34.5% in the second period. Nevertheless, the mean change from the baseline in the actual value at Visit 8 and Last Visit was an increase of 0.7kg and 6.0kg  respectively, with there being no clinically meaningful decreases in mean body weight. Weight decrease is recognized as an  ADR  for  LEV  in  the  approved  product  labeling,  and  the  observed  changes from  the  Baseline  weight  in  this  study  did  not  constitute  an  additional  safety concern.

## III.1.10  Conclusions by the MAH

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  efficacy  results  showed  a  reduction  in  the  median  percentage  of  partial seizures from Baseline across all time intervals and subsequent maintenance of efficacy throughout the study periods. The results on the PPS were positive and very similar to the results of the FAS analyses. This confirmed the robustness of the FAS analyses.

The  efficacy  of  LEV  treatment  was  verified  and  deemed  clinically  relevant because  the  median  percentage  reduction  from  baseline  in  partial  seizure frequency per week over the 14-week Treatment Period in the FAS was 43.21% and the 95% CI was between 26.19% and 52.14%. The lower limit of the 95% CI, 26.19%, was greater than the predefined value of 16.3%, which was the median percentage reduction  of  the  seizure  frequency  per  week  of  the  subjects  in  the placebo group of a 28-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study (N159).

Similar  to  the  First  Period,  there  was  a  reduction  in  the  median  percentage  of seizures during the Second Period. The median percentage reduction in seizure frequency  over  the  Evaluation  Period  during  the  Second  Period  was  41.32% compared to the First Period; 43.21% over the 14-week Treatment Period during the First  Period.  The  efficacy  of  LEV  treatment  was  sustained  over  time as  an adjunctive therapy in a long term use.

The safety profile showed that long-term treatment with LEV was generally well tolerated in the subjects in this study. Levetiracetam was safe and well tolerated, as  evaluated  by  the  safety  data,  which  covered  longer  than  3  years  for  the subjects with exposure to LEV.

Nasopharyngitis and somnolence were reported as distinctive TEAEs throughout the  study.  Nasopharyngitis  was  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  with  the incidence of 74.0% during the All Periods, and consistently occurred across the study  periods.  An  increase  in  the  incidence  of  nasopharyngitis  was  observed during the Second Period. This was considered due to the influence of the study duration that was longer in the second period.

Somnolence appeared to be related to LEV treatment. After the first dose of LEV 20mg/kg/day, 32.9% of the subjects reported somnolence during the Up-Titration Period. The onset of this event was increased to 43.8% during the First Period and was markedly decreased to 1.9% at the first 6 months of the Second Period. The  subjects  who  experienced  somnolence  appeared  to  adapt  the  LEV  dose, which led to the decrease in the number of the subjects who reported the event later in the course of study. Somnolence assessed as an ADR was reported by 42.5% of subjects during the All Periods with an exception of 1 event that was severe,  while  all  events  were  mild  in  intensity.  The  severe  somnolence  was  a result  of  aggravation  of  a  mild  somnolence  that  occurred  2  days  after  the initiation  of  LEV  treatment.  Worsening  of  the  intensity  was  associated  with  an increase of LEV dose during the Evaluation Period. Although the somnolence did not resolve, the subject who experienced the severe somnolence continued the study participation with a decreased LEV dose, which was also indicative that the subject could adapt the LEV dose and continue LEV treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The only ADR assessed as serious was an event of acetonaemic vomiting, which was judged by the investigator as unlikely related to LEV and resolved 3 days after  the  event  onset.  With  an  exception  of  a  fatal  SAE  of  near  drowning (considered  not  related  to  the  treatment),  all  other  SAEs  resolved  during  the study.

There  were  parameters  in  hematology,  blood  chemistry,  and  vital  signs  that indicated PCS values; however, the incidence of each parameter was relatively low and no trends in shifts from Baseline were noted.

The high incidences of treatment-emergent PCS values (too low) in body weight were reported as 24.7% in the First Period and 34.5% in the Second Period. In spite of this, the incidences of treatment-emergent PCS values in body weight did not suggest that the body weight became notably low after LEV treatment. The mean change in weight at Visit 8 from the Baseline was an increase of 0.7kg and there were no clinically meaningful decreases in mean body weight.

In conclusion, long-term adjunctive treatment with LEV  at the doses of 20mg/kg/day  or  1000mg/day  to  60mg/kg/day  or  3000mg/day  was  effective  in Japanese children aged ≥4 to &lt;16 years with partial onset seizures. Levetiracetam  plasma  concentrations  were  within  the  ranges  seen  in  previous studies. The results of efficacy measures demonstrated a reduction in seizures from  Baseline  and  maintenance  of  efficacy.  Levetiracetam  was  safe  and  well tolerated, as evaluated by the safety data which covered longer than 3 years for the subjects with exposure to LEV.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## III.2 Study N01363

## III.2.1  Introduction

Study N01363 was an n open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy  and  safety  of  adjunctive  treatment  with  levetiracetam  in  Japanese paediatric  patients  (≥4  to  &lt;16  years)  with  uncontrolled  generalized  tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures despite treatment with 1 or 2 antiepileptic drug(s).

## III.2.2  Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of LEV dry syrup at doses up to 60mg/kg/day or 3000mg/day used as adjunctive therapy in Japanese paediatric subjects aged ≥4 to &lt;16 years with uncontrolled GTC seizures, despite treatment with 1 or antiepileptic drugs (AED[s]).

No other objectives, secondary or primary were planned.

## III.2.3  Study Methodology

This study was designed as an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study taking 34 weeks, excluding a 4-week Retrospective Baseline, divided in 4 periods:

- -Combined Baseline  Period  (8  weeks:  4-week  Retrospective  Baseline  +  4week  Prospective  Baseline):  During  this  period,  informed  consent  was obtained  and  eligibility  assessed.  A  daily  record  card  was  dispensed  and samples for laboratory assessments were collected for the blood chemistry, hematology,  urinalysis,  and  pregnancy  test  (if  applicable).  For  subjects without Retrospective Baseline  documentation,  an  8-week  Prospective Baseline Period was scheduled.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Prospective 8weeks:

(NoRetrospectiveBaseline documentation)

<!-- image -->

V=visit;W=week

- -Up-Titration Period (4 weeks): During this period, subjects started the LEV treatment at 20mg/kg/day (subject weighing ≥50kg started at 1000mg/day) that was up-titrated to 60mg/kg/day (subject weighing ≥50kg was up-titrated to  3000mg/day).  The  LEV  dose  was  increased  by  20mg/kg/day  every  2 weeks (subject weighing ≥50kg was increased by 1000mg/day).
- -Evaluation Period (20 weeks): During this period, subjects were administered LEV at 60mg/kg/day or 3000mg/day.
- -Withdrawal Period (6 weeks including the 2-week follow up after the last LEV intake):  During  this  period,  the  LEV  dose  was  reduced  as  gradually  as possible  to  protect  subjects  from  aggravation  of  seizures,  considering  the subject's safety. All of the subjects in this period were required to attend a Follow-Up Visit 2 weeks after the last dosing of the treatment with LEV.

At the end of the evaluation period, if the Investigator decided to continue LEV treatment and the subject agreed, the latter continued the treatment with openlabel LEV in the long-term follow-up study, N01361. If the Investigator decided to discontinue LEV treatment, the subject entered the Withdrawal Period.

It was planned for least 15 subjects to enroll in this study, but even if this number was reached, further subject recruitment was to be continued until the time when the last subject first visit was completed in N01159, a different study to evaluate the  efficacy  and  safety  of  adjunctive  treatment  with  LEV  in  subjects  aged  ≥16 years  with  GTC  seizures.  In  reality,  enrollment  ended  after  13  subjects  were enrolled  in  the  study  due  to  difficulties in enrolling eligible  subjects  (with permission of the Japanese Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency).

## III.2.6  Subject Disposition

In total 13 subjects were screened and enrolled; there were no screen failures. Eleven subjects (84.6%) completed the study and entered the follow-up study, N01361. Two subjects (15.4%) discontinued the study.

<!-- image -->

Note: N01361 was an open-label, long-term, follow-up study for subjects ≥4 years of age.

Note: Subject 306-01807 discontinued the study for reason of other; the subject was administered an additional antiepileptic drug.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One subject (7.7%) discontinued the study due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of headache and somnolence. The ADRs were moderate in intensity, not serious, and were resolved upon follow up.

The other discontinuation was due to reasons classified as 'other'.

One subject (7.7%) had 1 important protocol deviation whereby the Up-Titration Period was not started with administration of LEV 20mg/kg/day as described in the Protocol, but instead with LEV 40mg/kg/day. No action was taken in regards to this deviation.

## III.2.7  Efficacy Results

The primary efficacy variable, the median percentage reduction in GTC seizure frequency  per  week  from  the  Combined  Baseline  Period  over  the  Treatment Period, was 56.52% with a CI as shown in table 1.

The  percentage  of  GTC  seizures  per  week  was  reduced  from  the  Combined Baseline Period over the Treatment Period across all subgroups by age, gender, epileptic  syndrome,  Baseline  seizure  frequency,  and  concomitant  AEDs  at Baseline.  Although  some  differences  in  percentage  reduction  of  GTC  seizures were  observed  between  subgroups,  there  were  too  few  subjects  to  permit meaningful comparisons.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects were 75% responders for the Treatment Period (30.8%) and Evaluation Period (33.3%).

Generalized  tonic-clonic  seizure  freedom  in  subjects  was  also  similar  between the  Treatment  Period  and  Evaluation  Period.  Two  subjects  were  seizure  free during the former and 2 were likewise during the latter.

The time to the first GTC seizure during the Treatment Period ranged from Day 1 (the  first  day  of  LEV  treatment)  for  1  subject,  to  Day  169  and  Day  173  of  the Treatment Period for the 2 subjects who remained seizure free.

There was no worsening of GTC seizure frequency during the Up-Titration Period and overall improvement in GTC seizure frequency was seen at each visit after starting treatment with LEV.

## III.2.8  Safety Results

In  total  41  treatment-emergent  AEs  (TEAEs)  that  were  mild  or  moderate  in severity were reported and no treatment-emergent serious AEs (SAEs) or deaths occurred.

As  mentioned  earlier,  one  subject  discontinued  the  study  due  to  adverse  drug reactions (ADRs).

The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  nasopharyngitis,  convulsion,  and somnolence,  each  reported by 3 subjects  (23.1%) overall.  Adverse  drug reactions  were  reported  by  5  subjects  (38.5%)  overall.  The  most  frequently reported ADR was somnolence, reported by 3 subjects (23.1%) overall.

In  general,  ≤2  subjects  reported  post-baseline  values  that  were  considered possibly  clinically  significant  (PCS)  for  any  hematology  or  blood  chemistry variable; no urinalysis results were PCS. Shifts from not PCS at Baseline to PCS post  Baseline  were  reported  for  hematocrit  (too  high),  leukocytes  (too  high), neutrophils (too low), triglycerides (too high), and urate (too high).

The  most  frequently  reported  vital  sign  measurement  with  a  PCS  shift  from Baseline was diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Six subjects (46.2%) reported DBP measurement  shifts  from  not  PCS  at  Baseline  to  too  low  or  too  high  post Baseline.  Systolic  blood  pressure  measurements  also  showed  PCS  shifts  from Baseline  for  2  subjects  and  pulse  rate  measurements  shifted  for  1  subject (7.7%). These changes were not considered clinically significant by the Investigator.

One subject (9.1%) reported an abnormal ECG finding of prolonged QT interval at  Visit  9.  The  event  was  considered  a  clinically  significant  ADR  that  was  not serious, mild in intensity, and was resolved after entering the long-term follow-up study.

None  of  the  observed  laboratory  values  or  physical  examination  presented findings that were of concern.

## III.2.9  Conclusions by the MAH

Overall, the efficacy results demonstrated improvement in GTC  seizure frequency  with  adjunctive  LEV  treatment  across  all  population  subgroups  and over all study periods and visits. The primary efficacy variable was the reduction in GTC  seizure  frequency  from  the Combined  Baseline  Period  over  the Treatment Period. There were some differences in the median reduction when analyzed  by  subgroup,  but  given  the  small  sample  size,  any  interpretation  of these  results  is  difficult.  Nonetheless,  improvement  in  GTC  seizure  frequency was observed in all subgroups.

The secondary efficacy variables were the reduction in GTC seizure frequency from  the  Combined  Baseline  Period  over  the  Evaluation  Period  and  the  GTC seizure  50%  responder  rates  and  seizure  freedom  over  the  Treatment  Period and  Evaluation  Period,  whereby  the  median  percentage  reduction  over  the Evaluation Period was 64.70%. The majority of subjects were 50% responders for  the  Treatment  Period  (53.8%)  and  the  Evaluation  Period  (58.3%)  and  2 subjects remained seizure free during these study periods.

From the Combined Baseline Period over the Treatment Period, there was also a 25% reduction in the number of any type of seizure per week. Levetiracetam is a treatment  for  other  seizure  types;  thus,  these  results,  while  limited,  are  not unexpected.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety profile suggests LEV was generally well tolerated at this exposure in the paediatric subjects in this study and the AEs reported were consistent with the known safety profile for LEV.

Overall, there were no clinically relevant trends in TEAE incidence across study periods, gender, or age categories.

The evaluation of clinical laboratories and vital signs did not indicate any clinically significant trends in changes from Baseline across study periods.

The following overall conclusions for N01363 were drawn:

Levetiracetam  at  doses  up  to  60mg/kg/day  or  3000mg/day  was  effective  in reducing  GTC  seizure  frequency  when  used  as  adjunctive  therapy  with  1  or  2 other AEDs in Japanese paediatric subjects aged ≥4 to &lt;16 years. Furthermore, Levetiracetam was safe and well tolerated as evaluated by the safety data and there were no new safety concerns for LEV identified in this study.

However, due to the small size  of  N01363,  drawing  conclusions  based  on  the limited results presented should obviously be cautioned.

## IV. CHMP OVERALL CONCLUSIONS

In these studies, the efficacy and safety of adjunctive treatment with levetiracetam in Japanese paediatric patients ( ≥ 4 to &lt;16 years) with uncontrolled generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures despite treatment with 1 or 2 antiepileptic drug(s) was confirmed. Keppra was shown to be effective and safe in long-term treatment of these subjects.

As Keppra dry syrup, the formulation mainly used throughout these studies, is not  a  registered  formulation  in  the  EU,  no  changes  to  the  approved  Product Information  for  Keppra  in  the  EU  were  proposed  following  completion  of  these studies. The MAH considered that the standard immediate release formulations of Keppra allow for appropriate use of levetiracetam in paediatric patients in the EU. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

These studies were solely submitted to comply with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulations.
