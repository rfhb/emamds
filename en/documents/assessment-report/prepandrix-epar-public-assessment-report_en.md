## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1. Introduction

An influenza pandemic is a global outbreak of influenza disease that occurs when a type A influenza strain to which most or all humans are immunologically naïve emerges to cause clinically apparent illness, and then spreads easily from person to person worldwide. Pandemics are different from seasonal outbreaks of influenza, as the latter are caused by subtypes of influenza viruses that are already circulating in the world whereas pandemics are caused by new subtypes or by subtypes that have not circulated among people for a long time.

The marketing authorisation application for Prepandrix was filed in accordance with the Guideline on influenza vaccines prepared from viruses with the potential to cause a pandemic and intended for use outside of the core dossier context (CHMP/VWP/263499/2006). This guideline was developed to cover the possibility that influenza vaccines containing or derived from strains with a pandemic potential (such as H5N1 avian influenza strains) might be used from WHO Phase 3 onwards in an attempt to provide some protection against clinically apparent disease when an actual pandemic commenced. Prepandrix is a split virion inactivated influenza vaccine. The final formulation contains 3.75 µg haemagglutinin (HA) of A/VietNam/1194/2004 NIBRG-14 (H5N1) per 0.5 ml dose adjuvanted by AS03. Prepandrix is indicated for active immunisation against H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus. This indication is based on immunogenicity data from healthy subjects aged 18-60 years following administration of two doses of vaccine prepared from A/VietNam/1194/2004 NIBRG-14 (H5N1). Prepandrix should be used in accordance with official guidance. It is intended for use in adults from the age of 18 years onwards and from WHO Pandemic phase 3 onwards. 2.2. Quality aspects Introduction Prepandrix is a split virion inactivated influenza vaccine. The final formulation contains 3.75 µg haemagglutinin (HA) of A/VietNam/1194/2004 NIBRG-14 (H5N1) per 0.5 ml dose adjuvanted by AS03. The reference virus described in the current MAA is A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) NIBRG-14 which was developed using reverse genetics. The reassortment strain combines the H5 and N1 segments to the PR8 strain backbone.  In addition the H5 was engineered to eliminate the polybasic stretch of amino-acids at the HA cleavage site that is responsible for high virulence of the original strains.The virus is propagated in fertilised hens' eggs. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The vaccine consists of a suspension vial with the H5N1 antigen and an oil-in-water emulsion vial with the AS03 adjuvant, which are mixed extemporaneously. Thiomersal, 10 μ g/ml (5 μ g per dose), is added because of the multi-dose presentation.

Each 0.5 ml dose of vaccine has the following composition:

Active Ingredient: Purified antigen fractions of inactivated split virion A/Vietnam/1194/2004 NIBRG-14 (H5N1)

3.75 µg HA

Adjuvant: Squalene Alpha-tocopherol Polysorbate 80

10.68 mg 11.86 mg 4.86 mg

Other Ingredients: Octoxynol 10 Sodium chloride Disodium phosphate Potassium dihydrogen phosphate Potassium chloride Magnesium chloride Thiomersal Water for injections

Inactivation  studies  performed  on  different  H5N1  strains  have  demonstrated  that  the  proposed inactivation method (Sodium deoxycholate and formaldehyde) results in complete inactivation. Based on experience with Fluarix, the ability of the manufacturing process to inactivate avian leucosis and

Drug Substance · Manufacture A  master  and  working  seed  were  prepared  from  the  NIBRG-14  reference  virus  received  from  the WHO Reference Centre (NIBSC, UK). The manufacturing process for the monovalent bulks is similar to  the  manufacturing  process  for  the  monovalent  bulks  of  the  licensed  product  Fluarix  (seasonal influenza virus) and can be divided into four main parts: · Propagation of the working seed in fertilised hen's eggs, harvesting and pooling of infected allantoic fluids · Purification of the whole virus bulk · Splitting of the monovalent with sodium deoxycholate · Inactivation  of  the  monovalent  split  virus  using  sodium  deoxycholate  and  formaldehyde, followed by ultrafiltration and sterile filtration The process parameters are generally derived from the Fluarix process. Where needed these have been specifically determined for this H5N1 strain. · Control of Materials The  following  starting  materials  used  in  the  production  of  the  monovalent  bulk  are  of  biological origin:  influenza  seed  virus,  eggs  and  sodium  deoxycholate  (derived  from  bovine  bile).  The  H5N1 working seed is derived from the A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 (H5N1) NIBRG-14 vaccine virus strain. The testing of the virus and the eggs is the same as for Fluarix.  Sufficient detailed information has been  provided  on  the  control  and  source  of  these  starting  materials.  The  genetic  stability  of  the A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) NIBRG-14 obtained through Reverse Genetics has been satisfactorily addressed. · Process validation Critical  steps  of  the  drug  substance  production  process  have  been  identified  and  are  sufficiently controlled.  Process consistency has been demonstrated on three commercial scale batches. Medicinal Product no longer authorised mycoplasma has been demonstrated.

## · Characterisation and specifications

The  structure  of  the  inactivated  split  monovalent  bulks  was  studied  by  transmission  electron microscopy and confirmed the predominance of disrupted particles after splitting.

Controls  include  HA  content,  neuraminidase  identity,  sterility  tests,  tests  for  residual  infectious viruses, residual sodium deoxycholate and test for disrupted virus particles (not routine) and are in line with Ph.Eur. monograph &lt;0158&gt;.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All analytical methods have been appropriately validated.

The  monovalent  bulks  are  filled  and  stored  in  10  l  glass  Type  I  containers  with  polypropylene closures.

## · Stability

Eighteen months of stability data at 2-8°C has been generated for three relevant batches.

## Drug Product

The drug product is described in three parts: The drug product containing H5N1 antigen, the AS03 adjuvant  and  the  mixed  AS03  adjuvanted  H5N1  influenza  vaccine  which  is  the  preparation  to  be administered within 24 hours. Drug Product (H5N1 vial) · Pharmaceutical Development Developmental  changes  implemented  since  the  first  clinical  studies  have  been  stated  and  clinical studies have provided reassurance of product remaining comparable. · Manufacture of the Product Manufacture for the antigen component consists of formulation of the final bulk with the excipients at SSW (Germany), transport from SSW (Germany) to GSK Biols (Belgium: Rixensart or Wavre sites) for filling into final containers and then finally labelling and packaging at GSK Biols (Wavre). Antigen  bulk  received  is  sterile.  Bioburden  is  adequately  controlled  throughout  the  manufacturing process. The sterile filtered H5N1 monovalent bulk (SSW, Dresden) and non-sterile excipients, are sterilised in-line, just prior to entering the mixing tank (SSW, Dresden).  The resultant bulk is then transported in HDPE containers, initially to GSK Wavre for cold storage, and then for filling at GSK Rixensart or GSK Wavre.  Formulation of final formulated bulk and subsequent filling into HDPE containers, and later, pooling of transported HDPE containers into the filling tank and subsequent filling is conducted under aseptic conditions.  Stability data have been submitted to support the maximum storage period of the formulated bulk filling into bulk HDPE containers (30 days) and in the filling tanks (14days). · Product Specification Compliance with the product specifications has been shown on three batches representative of the final formulation and commercial scale manufacture Specifications for excipients and analytical procedures are in line with the Ph.Eur.  Controls of final bulks (sterility, HA, total protein, residual ovalbumin, thiomersal, residual formaldehyde and residual sucrose) and final containers (sterility, bacterial endotoxins, pH, volume, thiomersal and HA) of the antigen vial are acceptable (Ph.Eur. or in line with Fluarix).  Methods are either in line with Ph.Eur. or are validated.  Specificity in presence of thiomersal has been demonstrated. HA  content,  sterility,  thiomersal  content,  endotoxin  content,  pH  and  description,  formaldehyde, ovalbumin  and  protein  content  are  measured  as  part  of  the  stability  studies.    Test  methods  and specifications are identical to those at release. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The Company proposes an 18 months expiry date - The proposed shelf life is accepted on basis of the commitment to provide updated stability results.

An overage of 10 % HA will be applied at formulation of the commercials lots and supporting data and satisfactory justification have been provided.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Drug Product (AS03 adjuvant vial)

## · Pharmaceutical Development

Developmental changes implemented since the first clinical studies have been stated and non-clinical and clinical studies have provided reassurance of product remaining comparable.

## · Manufacture of the AS03 adjuvant vial

Formulation of the AS03 adjuvant consists of the preparation of the bulk (formation of O/W emulsion using high shear and pressure homogenisation) followed by filling into glass vials.  Process parameters are  identified.    No  routine  in-process  tests  are  conducted.    Bioburden  is  adequately  controlled throughout the manufacturing process.

In addition, non-clinical studies have shown similar immune responses were observed when antigen and adjuvant were administered separately (one hour apart at the same site, or simultaneously in 2 separate syringes in the same area) or after administration of pre-mixed antigen and adjuvant.

· Specifications of the AS03 adjuvant With the exception of squalene, all excipients are described and controlled in line with the Ph.Eur. Adequate  quality  control  of  squalene  is  performed  by  the  supplier  and  by  GSK  (according  to  an internal GSK monograph which is in line with the Ph.Eur. monograph for squalane). Emulsion bulk and AS03 final containers are tested at release for Description, Identity and Content of adjuvant components (polysorbate 80, α -tocopherol and squalene), pH, Endotoxin content, Sterility, Particle size, Polydispersity index and Volume (final containers only). Tests  for  sterility  and  bacterial  endotoxins  are  performed  in  line  with  the  Ph.Eur.  and  tests  for polysorbate 80, α -tocopherol and squalene are validated.  The method used for particle size analysis and associated system suitability measurements is acceptable. · Stability of the AS03 adjuvant Data  provided  from  the  stability  studies  for  the  bulk  emulsion  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  of  2 years.  For final AS03 container lots a shelf-life of 18 months has been approved. Drug Product (mixed H5N1 and AS03 vial) At the time of extemporaneous dispensing, adjuvant is added to antigen vial. Data from 'withdrawable'  volume  studies  conducted  to  support  the  required  overfill  for  both  antigen  and adjuvant  vials  is  provided.    Information  on  long  term  storage  (1  week)  of  mixed  AS03  adjuvanted H5N1 is also provided. Preservative  efficacy  of  thiomersal  concentration  after  mixing  the  content  of  the  antigen  container with AS03 adjuvant has been shown in line with Ph.Eur. Sufficient compatibility/stability data has been provided in the dossier. SDS PAGE and Western blot analysis performed show that profiles of the adjuvanted formulation are comparable to the non-adjuvanted  formulation  and  remain  unchanged  after  a  period  of  24  hours  at 25°C.  Interaction between antigen and adjuvant has been shown to be limited by various biophysical methods. Uniformity of dose has been demonstrated for the 10-dose product. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Therefore, it is accepted that there is no need to control antigen/adjuvant interaction for this product. Sufficient  evidence  has  been  provided  that  there  is  little/no  effect  of  the  reconstitution  conditions (mixing time and conditions) on the essential characteristics of the antigen/adjuvant combination. The proposed in-use shelf life of 24 hours is considered justified based on stability/characterisation data provided.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Prepandrix is a split virion inactivated influenza vaccine. The final formulation is an emulsion for injection and contains 3.8 µg haemagglutinin (HA) of A/VietNam/1194/2004 NIBRG-14 (H5N1) per 0.5 ml dose adjuvanted by AS03. AS03 consists of the oil-in-water emulsion containing DLα -tocopherol, squalene and tween 80. Thiomersal, 10 μ g/ml (5 μ g per dose), is added because of the multi-dose presentation.

Prepandrix is presented in multidose vials. After reconstitution prior to use (extemporaneous mixing of the antigen vial (suspension) with the adjuvant vial (emulsion)), the vial contains 10 vaccine doses.

Drug Substance The reference virus is A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) NIBRG-14 which was developed using reverse genetics. The virus is propagated in fertilised hens' eggs. The manufacture of the drug substance, the monovalent antigen bulk, is almost identical to that  of the licensed split  antigen  seasonal  influenza vaccine (Fluarix) and is adequately described. The process parameters are generally derived from the Fluarix process. Where needed these have been specifically determined for this H5N1 strain. The testing of the virus and the eggs is the same as for Fluarix. Critical steps of the drug substance production process have been identified and are generally sufficiently controlled.  Process consistency has been demonstrated on three commercial scale batches. Release specifications are in line with the currently approved specification for Fluarix and include HA content, neuraminidase identity, sterility tests, tests for residual infectious viruses, residual sodium deoxycholate and test for disrupted virus particles (not routine) and are in line with Ph.Eur. monograph &lt;0158&gt;. Eighteen months of stability data at 2-8°C has been generated for three relevant batches of monovalent bulk. Drug Product Manufacture  for  the  H5N1  antigen  component  consists  of  formulation  of  the  final  bulk  with  the excipients  at  SSW  (Germany),  transport  from  SSW  (Germany)  to  GSK  Biologicals  (Belgium: Rixensart or Wavre sites) for filling into final containers and then finally labelling and packaging at GSK Biologicals (Wavre). The H5N1 antigen vial is appropriately controlled. 18 month stability data at 2-8 °C have been generated. The manufacture and control of the adjuvant vial is adequately controlled. Stability data with the AS03 final containers is available to 18 months at 2-8 °C. At the time of extemporaneous dispensing, adjuvant is added to antigen vial.  It is accepted that there is no need to control antigen/adjuvant interaction for this product: sufficient evidence has been provided that there is little/no effect of the mixing time and conditions on the essential characteristics of the antigen/adjuvant combination.  The proposed in-use shelf life of 24 hours is considered justified based on stability/characterisation data provided. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Preclinical  development  of  Prepandrix  was  generally  in  agreement  with  current  guidelines.  The antigen is produced in hen's eggs using the same process as that is applied to the Applicant's own Fluarix brand of seasonal influenza vaccine.  This was approved in 1992 and over 200 million doses have  been  manufactured.    As  advised  in  regulatory  guidance  documents,  preclinical  testing  with Fluarix can be used to support this application, based on the similarity of manufacture.

The safety studies included in the dossier were compliant with GLP.

<!-- image -->

Pharmacology · Primary pharmacodynamics Primary pharmacodynamic properties were investigated in mice, pigs and ferrets. The  studies  demonstrate  the  ability  of  the  AS03  adjuvant  to  augment  immunological  responses  to  the vaccine in mice and pigs.  The data from the pig study show a statistically significant effect of dose of adjuvant  in  one  of  the  three  tested  influenza  strains,  the  B/Shangdong  strain.  A  non-significant  doseresponse effect might be suggested with the A/Panama strain. Efficacy of the vaccine was tested in a challenge test in ferrets.  Survival data are compelling in that, where a sufficient dose of antigen was used, protection from a lethal challenge was obtained. Consistent changes in serological and pathological parameters were detected and it can be concluded that the vaccine provided protection from virus-associated pathological changes. · Secondary pharmacodynamics Secondary pharmacodynamic studies were not performed. This approach is in accordance with the relevant guidelines, note for guidance on preclinical pharmacological and toxicological testing of vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95) and the guideline on dossier structure and content for pandemic influenza vaccine marketing authorisation application, CPMP/VEG/4717/03. · Safety pharmacology programme No safety  pharmacology  studies  were  performed  with  Prepandrix  vaccine.  A  study  was  reported  in  the anaesthetised rat, using trivalent influenza vaccine, adjuvanted with AS03, or saline.  Single intramuscular injection of 0.1 ml of this vaccine administered to anaesthetised male Wistar rats (n = 4) did not produce any effects on cardiovascular or respiratory parameters in the 2 hour period following dosing.  The vaccine used in this study contains 15 μ g HA per strain and AS03.  The dose represents 63 fold higher than the human exposure, on a μ g/kg bodyweight comparison. · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions No studies were performed. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Pharmacokinetics

Experimental studies to demonstrate absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the active ingredients in Prepandrix have not been performed. This is in line with the relevant guidelines CPMP/SWP/465/95 and CPMP/VEG/4717/03.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

The Applicant refers to the local tolerance study for consideration of single-dose toxicity.

- Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Two studies in the rabbit using intramuscular injection have been performed.  One used four doses of the adjuvanted vaccine and the second used two doses of a trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine, with the AS03 adjuvant. Pandemic influenza vaccine:  toxicity study in the rabbit after 4 injections 10 male and 10 female New Zealand White rabbits were injected with test item by the intramuscular route on Days 1, 15, 29 and 43 and were killed for pathological examination on either Day 46 or Day 71. Periodical assessments included mortality, clinical observations, injection site reactions, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmological examination, body temperature, haematology, clinical chemistry, organ weights and macro- and microscopic examination of tissues, including evaluation of spermatogenesis. Very  slight  erythema  and/or  oedema  occurred  commonly  but  abated  within  48  hours.    On  subsequent injections this was no more marked than the control group.  There were no other clinical signs noted. There  was  evidence  of  an  inflammatory  response  in  haematology,  clinical  chemistry  and  pathological parameters.  Increases in fibrinogen and white blood cell counts were noted in temporal association with the erythema and oedema noted on observing the rabbits.  Relative to body weight, the spleen weight was increased in all groups compared to the control (7 - 41%).  This difference was much less marked from rabbits killed on Day 71, 28 days after the last injection, indicating reversibility. Frequency  and  severity  of  fasciitis  was  higher  in  rabbits  from  the  vaccine  group.  This  toxicity  was attributed to the adjuvant. Seasonal influenza vaccine:  toxicity study in the rabbit after 2 injections 10 male and 10 female New Zealand White rabbits were injected with 0.5 ml of test item by the intramuscular route on Days 1 and 24 and were killed for pathological examination on either Day 27 or Day 52. There  were  no  deaths  and  no  clinical  signs  detected  in  this  study,  except  one  instance  of  very  mild erythema  shortly  after  injection  of  the  seasonal  vaccine  Fluarix.    Minor  changes  indicative  of  an inflammatory response were noted in clinical chemistry and haematology in rabbits dosed with AS03 or with the trivalent influenza vaccine.  These changes reduced over time, indicating recovery. · Genotoxicity Genotoxicity of the adjuvant alone was assessed in two in vitro tests (reverse mutation test in bacteria; gene mutation in mouse cells) and one in vivo test (micronucleus test in the rat after intravenous administration). The vaccine was not tested. No indication of genotoxicity was evident. · Carcinogenicity Medicinal Product no longer authorised

No carcinogenicity studies were conducted which is in line with the Note for Guidance on Preclinical pharmacological and toxicological testing of vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95)

## · Reproduction Toxicity

Preliminary immunogenicity studies were performed in the rat in which the immunogenic responses of the  dams,  foetuses  and  pups  were  confirmed,  demonstrating  that  the  rat  is  a  suitable  species  for assessing toxicity of the vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  this  study,  six  groups  of  48  female  rats  were  given  a  single  intramuscular  dose  on  Day  -30  and paired with males and 44 rats with a positive indication of mating were treated on Days 6, 8, 11 and 15 after mating.  22 were killed at Day 20 and 22 were allowed to deliver and rear their young to Day 25 of age.  Measures of reproductive toxicity and maternal health were assessed.  The six groups were dosed with:

- 1 saline, 200 μ l
- 2 AS03 adjuvant, 200 μ l
- 3 saline / split H5N1/AS03, 200 μ l
- 4 split H5N1 / AS03, 200 μ l
- 5 saline /whole H5N1/A1, 100 μ l
- 6 whole H5N1/A1, 100 μ l

There was one unexpected death in a maternal rat: however, this was judged unrelated to the vaccine. Treatment  of  maternal  rats  did  not  adversely  affect  their  clinical  condition,  bodyweight  or  food consumption  throughout  the  study.    Mating  performance,  fertility  of  maternal  rats,  and  length  of gestation or ability to give birth to a live litter were unaffected.  Embryo-foetal survival, growth and development were not affected by vaccination.  In neonates, the reflex development was unimpaired, but  among offspring from dams treated with AS03 13 offspring from 7 litters did not show the air righting reflect before day 21 of age and this effect may be related to treatment.  However, AS03 did not affect the attainment of the surface righting reflex or the ability of the offspring to show startle response  reflexes  or  the  pupil  reflex.    No  abnormalities  were  evident  on  macro  pathological examination of the offspring.  This is considered a suitable study to assess the reproductive toxicity of the vaccine. · Local tolerance The test items in this study were the adjuvant, AS03, a candidate trivalent influenza vaccine adjuvanted with AS03, and Fluarix, which is the Applicant's approved inactivated influenza vaccine and which is not adjuvanted.  Thus, the vaccine intended to be marketed was not used in this test.  This study also served as the assessment of single dose toxicity. Single intramuscular injection of the test items (n = 3) or of saline (n = 2) into the thigh muscle of New Zealand White rabbits was followed by clinical observation for dermal reactions (erythema and oedema were each graded separately on 5 point scales) and clinical signs until Day 4 when rabbits were killed and subject to microscopic examination of the injection sites. Dose volumes of 0.5 ml were used, injected into the  upper  and  the  lower  thigh.    7.5  and  15 μ g  of  trivalent  influenza  was  used  (the  clinical  dose  of  the monovalent vaccine is 3.75 μ g). There  were  no  deaths  or  clinical  signs  in  the  study.    On  visual  examination,  dermal  reactions  were unremarkable, with very slight oedema noted in one rabbit 3 hours after injection of the adjuvant AS03, and also in another rabbit injected with the trivalent vaccine. Very slight erythema was noted commonly in all groups.  On microscopic examination, the adjuvant was associated with multifocal or diffuse infiltrating low grade sub-acute fasciitis with macrophage infiltration.  Fasciitis of the skin was also evident.  These effects were more evident than in tissues from rabbits injected with either saline or Fluarix.  Such changes were also noted in tissue from rabbits injected with the trivalent vaccine, to a similar degree. · Other toxicity studies Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Pharmacokinetic studies were not performed in accordance with the note for guidance on clinical evaluation of new vaccines (CPMP/EWP/463/97) and the Guideline on influenza vaccines prepared from viruses with the potential to cause a pandemic and intended for use outside of the core dossier context (CHMP/VWP/263499/2006). Pharmacodynamics In relation to vaccines, pharmacodynamic studies are essentially compromised of the immunogenicity studies that characterise the immune response to vaccines. The detailed characterisation of the immunological response to the vaccines is discussed below. Clinical efficacy Clinical trials on protective efficacy for the influenza vaccine cannot be performed. Therefore, the assessment of the potential protective efficacy of Prepandrix has been based on the detailed characterisation of the immunological response to the vaccine. The available data at the time of the initial filing pertained solely to first series production lots and to administration of 1 ml volumes with a range of HA doses from 3.8 to 30 µg (007) or with 15 μ g HA (008). Immunogenicity data were available to D42 i.e. 3 weeks after the second dose. N safety = Total vaccinated cohort; N immuno = ATP cohort for immunogenicity *:  Vaccine doses were expressed using only one digit throughout the clinical documentation, i.e. 3.75 μ g Haemagglutinin [HA] was rounded up to 3.8 μ g HA in the dossier.

Assays Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay Anti-haemagglutinin antibody titres were measured using the method described by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Influenza, Centres for Disease Control, Atlanta, USA (1991). The following parameters were assessed: · Seropositivity rate defined as the percentage of vaccinees with a minimum titre of 1:10. · Seroconversion  factor  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  post-vaccination  GMT  divided  by  the  prevaccination GMT. · Seroconversion rate defined as the proportion which were either seronegative prior to vaccination and had a post-vaccination titre ≥ 1:40 or who were seropositive prior to vaccination and had at least a 4-fold increase in titre post-vaccination. · Seroprotection rate defined as the proportion in each group with post-vaccination titres ≥ 1:40. Virus Neutralisation (NA) Assay Virus  neutralisation  was  determined  in  a  micro-neutralisation  assay.  Each  serum  was  tested  in triplicate. A standardised amount of virus was mixed with serial dilutions of serum and incubated to allow binding of the antibodies to the virus. Results of neutralising serum antibodies were expressed as follows: o Seropositivity rate defined as the percentage of vaccinees with a minimum titre of 28 (1/dil). o Seroconversion rate (with 95% CI) defined as the percentage of vaccinees with a minimum 4fold increase in titre from pre- to post-vaccination o GMTs of serum neutralising antibodies pre- and post-vaccination (with 95%CI) Influenza-specific cellular responses: intracellular cytokine staining assay (Study 007 only) The assay involved stimulation of peripheral blood antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in vitro to produce cytokines on incubation with corresponding antigen. Antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells were enumerated by flow cytometry following conventional immunofluorescence labelling of cellular phenotype (using anti CD8 APC Cy7 / anti CD4 PerCP) as well as intracellular cytokine production Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Results were expressed as a frequency of cytokine(s)-positive CD4 or CD8 T cells within the CD4 or CD8 T cell population..

## Dose response studies

The dose-finding study 007 employed first series vaccine and compared four dose groups, each with and without adjuvant. Although study 008 was not a dose-finding study the data on immune responses to 15 μ g doses of the H5 haemagglutinin (HA) could be considered to add to the rationale for the final choice of dose.

## Main studies

Studies H5N1- 002, H5N1-007 and H5N1-008 (extention -011) are described together.

## METHODS

Study Participants

Studies H5N1-002 and -007 enrolled healthy males and females aged 18 to 60 years while study 008 also enrolled subjects aged &gt; 60 years. Study groups were as in the tables above.

Treatments Study groups were as in the tables above. Objectives In study 007 immunogenicity (HI) and safety were co-primary objectives. In study 008 the primary objective was to evaluate the safety of a 15 μ g/AS03 candidate vaccine but immunogenicity was evaluated in a subset. In study 002 the primary objective was to demonstrate the consistency of the HI immune response elicited by four lot groups derived from mixing of 2 lots of HA and 2 lots of AS03. Outcomes/endpoints In study  H5N1-007 the  primary  endpoints  were  related  to  the  HI  titres  at  days  0,  21,  42.  The neutralising antibody (NA) titres were secondary. In study H5N1-008 t he primary endpoints regarding safety were percentage, intensity and relationship to vaccination of solicited and unsolicited local and general signs and symptoms, occurrence of serious adverse events up to Day 51 and occurrence of new onset chronic diseases up to Day 51 in each group. The secondary endpoints included GMTs at days 0, 21 and 42 and seroconversion rates at days 21 and 42 (with 95% confidence intervals) were calculated for HI and SNA data. In study H5N1-002 , lot consistency, based on HI GMTs was the primary endpoint. Sample size and Randomisation In H5N1-007 the randomisation algorithm used a minimisation procedure accounting for centre and age and subjects were stratified according to age (18-30 years old or 31 to 60 years old). The target sample size was 400 (i.e. 50 for each of the eight groups) to provide 360 evaluable subjects. In H5N1-008 the randomisation algorithm used a minimisation procedure accounting for centre and age  and  employed  three  strata  (18-30,  31-60  and  &gt;  60  years).  There  was  a  3:1  allocation  ratio  in favour  of  the  candidate  vaccine.  The  sample  size  was  calculated  at  5052  subjects  to  provide  4800 evaluable  taking  into  account  a  5%  dropout  rate.  This  number  was  to  include  4526  subjects  aged between 18-60 years and 526 aged 61 years or above. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## In H5N1-002

The target sample size was 1090 enrolled subjects (four groups of 218 subjects, two control groups of 109 subjects) in order to reach 980 evaluable subjects.

## Blinding (masking)

Studies  were  observer-blinded  due  to  differences  in  the  appearances  of  the  vaccines.  In  order  to maintain the blinding study personnel who vaccinated the subjects were not involved in the evaluation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of  endpoints  and  access  to  the  vaccines  was  restricted  to  the  person(s)  in  charge  of  accountability, preparation and administration.

## Statistical methods

In study H5N1-007 the analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was used to test 'haemagglutinin-dose' (3.8, 7.5, 15 or 30 µg HA) effect and 'adjuvantation' effect (with or without AS03).

In study H5N1-008 the main analysis was performed when all data on the humoral immune response and safety, up to D42 and were available.

In study H5N1-002 it was considered that lot consistency was demonstrated if, for all pairs of lots, the two-sided 95% CIs for the ratio of anti-HA GMT at D42 were within [0.5, 2.0].

Pre-vaccination, nine subjects were seropositive for antibody to A/Vietnam/1194/2004 but only three were seroprotected (i.e. HI titre ≥ 1:40).  The  70%  threshold  for  seroprotection  rates  (SPR)  was  not reached  in  any  group  after  one  dose.  After  two  doses  the  70%  threshold  was  exceeded  in  all  four adjuvanted formulation groups (range 84 - 96 %) but in none of the non-adjuvanted vaccine groups.

Study populations The following populations were defined: Total Vaccinated cohort: all vaccinated subjects for whom data were available. According-To-Protocol (ATP) for safety: all vaccinated with sufficient safety data for analysis. ATP for immunogenicity: all evaluable subjects with immunogenicity data available. RESULTS Recruitment The H5N1-007 study was initiated at a single site in Belgium (Ghent) in March 2006. The H5N1-008 study was initiated at 41 sites in seven countries (6 EU MS plus Russia) in May 2006. The current study report refers to a data lock point in October 2006. Study H5N1-002 was initiated on 24 March 2007 in 4 SE Asian countries. Numbers analysed  / Baseline data / Conduct of the study In  study H5N1-002 1206  subjects  were  enrolled  into  the  study  and  1190  completed  primary immunisation. In study H5N1-007 400 subjects were enrolled, with 49-51 randomised to each dose/adjuvant group. Of these  400,  399  were  evaluable  for  safety  and  394  met  the  criteria  for  the  ATP  immunogenicity analysis. H5N1-008 enrolled in total 5075 subjects of which 5071 subjects were vaccinated and 4904 completed to D51. Immunogenicity was assessed up to D180 in a subset of the total enrolled.

After the second vaccination with all adjuvanted formulations and with non-adjuvanted formulations containing 30 or 15 µg HA the seroconversion factors (SCFs) exceeded 2.5 but ranged from 27.9 to 60.5  for  adjuvanted  vaccines  compared  to  a  maximum  value  of  only  3.9  among  non-adjuvanted formulations. After both the first and second vaccinations the percentage of seroconverted subjects was significantly superior in groups vaccinated with adjuvanted formulations. There was no significant difference in the post-vaccination anti-HA antibody titre between the four groups that received adjuvanted formulations. For each dose of HA, a significant difference was detected between the adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted groups. Seroprotection rates to A/Vietnam/1194/2004 for the adjuvanted vaccine groups at D180 ranged from 54 - 64 %. In the 3.8 μ g HA +AS03 group the seroprotection rates were 84% at D42 and 54% at D180.

Seroconversion  factors  against  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  were  reduced  compared  to  values  obtained  at Day 42 in both adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccine groups. In the 3.8 μ g/AS03 vaccine group the SCFs were 27.9 at D42 but 4.4 at D180. NA titres against the vaccine strain Pre-vaccination, between one fifth and one third per group already had NA titres of at least 1:28 while 10 to 25% per group had titres ≥ 1:40 and 2 to 10% had titres ≥ 1:80. GMTs increased significantly after  the  first  and  second  vaccinations  with  adjuvanted  formulations.  At  D42  most  subjects  in  the adjuvanted groups had titres above the two cut-offs (i.e. 97.9% - 100% at 1:40 and 91.5% - 100% at 1:80). Similarly, seroconversion rates were higher in groups vaccinated with adjuvanted formulations. An HA dose effect was detected in non-adjuvanted groups only.

HI and NA titres against heterologous H5N1 strains Pre-vaccination, no subject was seropositive (HI titre ≥ 10) for A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) i.e. a clade 2 sub-clade 1 strain. o By D42 GMTs approximately doubled in the adjuvanted formulation groups and the number of seropositive subjects increased significantly to reach 26.5 to 48% per group. D42 SCFs ranged from  2.0  to  2.8.  The  percentage  of  vaccinees  that  seroconverted  after  the  second  vaccination ranged from 20% to 32% per group. o After both the first and second vaccinations with non-adjuvanted formulations, the seroconversion factors were equal to 1.0 and no subjects seroconverted. o At D180 seropositivity rates for anti-HA against the A/Indonesia/5/2005 strain were ≤ 10% for both adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccine groups and seroprotection rates were all ≤ 6%. Cross-reactivity was assessed against two additional H5N1 drifted clade 2 strains -A/Anhui/01/2005/subclade  3  and  A/Turkey/Turkey/1/2005  -  NIBRG23/subclade  2.  Assays  were performed on sera from a subset of 40 subjects who received 3.8 μ g HA with or without AS03.  No subject was seropositive for either strain before the first dose. Adjuvanted vaccine mediated a significant increase in GMT at D42 against both strains, although the absolute titres were low, and 55% - 65% were seropositive at this time point.  At D42, seroconversion and seroprotection rates in the adjuvanted group were both 35% against A/Anhui/01/2005 and 60% against A/Turkey/Turkey/1/2005 but rates were ≤ 5% by D180. In the adjuvanted vaccine group the D42 seroconversion factors were 3.4 and 4.7 for respective strains. For NA against A/Indonesia/5/05 (H5N1) 0-8.3% in 7/8 groups were seropositive with respect to this strain  pre-vaccination  but  the  rate  was  21.3%  (10/47)  in  the  7.5/AS03  group.  At  least  88%  were seropositive  after  two  doses  and  79  -  83%  had  a  titre ≥ 1:40  while  46  -  58%  had ≥ 1:80. Seroconversion rates increased significantly (up to 63-77%) after the second vaccination.

At D180 the NA seropositivity rates against the A/Indonesia/5/2005 strain in the adjuvanted groups were 82% to 92% compared to 6 - 49% in the non-adjuvanted groups. For the 3.8 μ g HA + AS03 vaccine  the  rates  were  87.5%  at  D42  and  82%  at  D180.  There  was  no  antigen  dose  effect  in  the adjuvanted groups for seropositivity rates, GMTs or seroconversion rates.

NA assays performed against A/Anhui/01/2005/subclade 3 and A/Turkey/Turkey/1/2005 -NIBRG23/subclade 2 showed that 0-4 subjects per group had detectable antibody before vaccination. By D42 1-2 subjects in the non-adjuvanted groups had become seropositive but none met the criteria for  seroconversion  and  there  was  no  change  in  GMTs.  The  adjuvanted  vaccine  elicited  significant increases  in  GMTs  after  the  first  and  second  doses.  At  D42  all  subjects  were  seropositive  for  NA against these strains and 75% and 85% had seroconverted against A/Anhui/01/2005 and A/Turkey/Turkey/1/2005,  respectively.  At  D180  all  except  one  subject  in  the  adjuvanted  groups remained  seropositive  for  both  strains  and  60%  and  70%  still  met  the  seroconversion  criterion although GMTs had declined by about one third. Influenza-specific T-cells Pre-vaccination  frequencies  of  influenza-specific  CD4  T-cells  were  similar  across  groups.  On stimulation with split A/Vietnam/1194/2004 frequencies of influenza-specific CD4 T-cells significantly increased in all groups after the first vaccination but essentially remained unchanged after the second dose. This lack of detectable increment after the second dose might have occurred because the sample was taken after the peak response occurred. The frequencies of influenza-specific CD4 Tcells  were  higher  in  adjuvanted  compared  with  non-adjuvanted  formulation  groups.  No  significant effect of antigen dose was detected.

T-cell cross-reactivity was also examined using pools of peptides derived from the HA of the vaccine strain,  the  H5N1  drifted  clade  2  subclade1  A/Indonesia/5/2005  and  the  Anhui  clade  2  subclade  3 (A/Anhui/01/2005) strain. Data were generated for D0 and D42 in the 3.8 µg HA non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted groups. There was only a weak response with respect to each strain in the non-adjuvanted group. The adjuvanted vaccine elicited a significant increase in the response against HA peptides from A/Vietnam, A/Indonesia and A/Anhui.

Values were higher after vaccination with the AS03 adjuvanted compared to non-adjuvanted formulations. Individual differences between D180 and D0 in CD4 responses showed a statistically significant  difference  between  adjuvanted  and  non-adjuvanted  groups  for  both  3.8 μ g  and  7.5 μ g formulations for all types of cytokines except IFN γ . The pre-vaccination frequency of influenza-specific CD8 T-cells was essentially similar in all groups. No significant effect of vaccination was observed on the frequency of influenza-specific CD8 T-cells at D42 or at D180 whatever the formulation received. T-cell cross-reactivity was examined against the clade 2 subclade 1 A/Indonesia/5/2005 strain for D0 and  D42  in  the  3.8  µg  HA  non-adjuvanted  and  adjuvanted  groups  from  study  007.  The  3.8  µg HA/AS03  formulation  induced  a  cross-reactive  CD4+  T  cell  response  to  the  heterologous  clade  2 H5N1 A/Indonesia/05/05 strain that was similar to that against the vaccine strain. The response to both strains was higher in the adjuvanted vaccine group. There was also a limited CD4+ T cell response to the heterologous split virions H3N2 New-York (NY) and H1N1 New Caledonia (NC). It is not known whether  the  cross-recognised  domains  belong  to  the  split  virion  backbone  (PR8)  and/or  represent conserved T cell epitopes on haemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase proteins.

## StudyH5N1- 008 (and extension to D180 as study 011)

## HI titres against the vaccine strain

Pre-vaccination  0-2.5%  of  subjects  aged  &lt;  60  years  but  10-18%  aged  &gt;  60  years  were  already seropositive. Due to the baseline seropositivity rates the data shown below refer only to subjects who were  initially  seronegative  and,  therefore,  the  seroprotection  rates  and  seroconversion  rates  are  the same.

In  adults  aged  between  18  and  60  years,  the  seroprotection  rate  exceeded  the  70%  seroprotection threshold after the second vaccination. In adults aged above 60 years, the 60% threshold was exceeded after the first vaccination (61.4%). In both age-strata, the seroprotection rates reached 91.4% at D42.

In both age-strata, the SCFs exceeded the relevant CHMP thresholds after the first dose of 15µg/AS03. After the second dose the SCFs significantly increased in both age-strata but the increment and the final GMT were higher in adults aged between 18 and 60 years than in those aged &gt; 60 years. There were no appreciable changes in GMTs after Fluarix was given in either age group. Initially seronegative subjects: Seroprotection rates for anti-HA (ATP cohort) At  D180  58%  of  those  aged  &lt;  60  years  and  79%  aged  &gt;  60  years  in  the  group  that  had  received 15µg/AS03 were seroprotected. The seroprotection rate at D180 was the same (58%) for the 18-30 and 31-60 years groups. In contrast only 2% of those aged &lt; 60 and 18% of those &gt;60 years who had been primed with Fluarix were seroprotected at D180. The seroconversion rates were 57% and 74% for the younger and older age groups, respectively, who had received 15µg/AS03 compared to 2% and 9% in the control group.

## NA titres against the vaccine strain

NA data were provided for subjects aged &gt; 60 years. Data in younger subjects are awaited.

-  The majority  of  these  older  subjects  (82%  and  91%  per  group)  were  already  seropositive  (i.e. titres  at  least  1:28)  for  NA  to  the  vaccine  strain  before  vaccination.  The  percentages  with  prevaccination  titres ≥ 1:40  or ≥ 1:80  were  similar  between  the  15  µg  HA/AS03  and  the  Fluarix control group (i.e. 69.5% and 67.3% at 1:40, with 44.6% and 40.0% at 1:80).
-  After a single dose of the adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine all except one subject was seropositive. After a second dose there were further and significant increments in GMT and SCR.

## HI titres

Consistency among the four adjuvanted vaccine lots based on pre-defined criteria applied to D42 data was demonstrated. GMTs for anti-HA antibody were very similar between the four adjuvanted groups on  D0,  D21 and  D42  for  the  homologous  vaccine  strain  and  were  also  similar  between  groups  but much lower against A/Indonesia/5/2005 (next table). Results for the two non-adjuvanted groups were similar  to  each  other  but  showed  a  very  small  anti-HA  response  to  the  vaccine  strain  and  no discernible response to the heterologous strain.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The SCF threshold of ≥ 2.5 was reached in the pooled H5N1 adjuvanted AS03 vaccine group after the first  dose  (4.1)  and  the  second  dose  (39.8)  for  the  A/Vietnam  strain  but  only  after  the  second  dose (4.9) for the A/Indonesia strain.

Similar findings applied to the seroconversion rates for anti-HA antibody for each vaccine group and for pooled adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted groups. The SCR in the pooled adjuvanted group at D42 was 94% for the vaccine strain and 50% for the heterologous strain and the required 40% threshold was reached after a single dose.

## NA titres

Before vaccination 17 - 20% of subjects were seropositive for NA against the vaccine strain while 5 11% of subjects were seropositive for NA against A/Indonesia/2005.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the individual adjuvanted groups the percentages with titres ≥ 1:28 at D42 ranged from 98-100% for the vaccine strain and 92-100% for the heterologous strain (next table). In contrast, percentages with titres ≥ 1:28 at D42 in the two non-adjuvanted groups were 42% and 54% for the vaccine strain and 17% and 11% for the heterologous strain.

For the pooled adjuvanted vaccine groups the seroconversion rate was 96% for the H5N1 A/Vietnam strain and 91.4% for A/Indonesia/2005.

The  seroprotection  rates  in  subjects  aged  18-60  years  at  D180  were  54%  after  priming  with  3.8 µg/AS03 in study 007 compared to 58% primed with 15 μ g/AS03 in study 008. The respective HI GMTs at D180 were 23.3 and 27.2.

Ancillary analyses Comparison of results with adjuvanted vaccine in studies 002, 007 and 008 On comparing D42 data for the 3.8 µg/AS03 vaccine the HI titres against the vaccine strain tended to be  higher  for  the  924  subjects  tested  in  study  002  compared  to  the  50  tested  in  study  007.  On comparing study 002 with the results for the 15 µg HA/AS03 vaccine used in study 008 the GMT and SCF were higher (95% CI do not overlap) with the higher dose vaccine but the seroconversion rates and seroprotection rates were similar between the two doses of adjuvanted HA. There is clearly a need for two doses of Prepandrix to meet all three CHMP criteria with respect to HI against the vaccine strain in healthy adults aged 18-60 years. D42 HI against vaccine strain in adults aged 18-60 years from H5N1-007, H5N1-008 and H5N1-002 (ATP immunogenicity cohort) compared to CHMP criteria Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Based on these comparisons of D42 data between studies the D180 immunogenicity data from studies 007 and 008 (i.e. 3.8 μ g/AS03 or 15 µg/AS03) should be indicative of the D180 status of subjects who have received two doses of the final production process 3.8 μ g/AS03 vaccine in study 002. Thus the CHMP  requirement  for  provision  of  6-month  post-primary  vaccination  immunogenicity  data  was considered to be fulfilled.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  D42  NA  response  against  the  vaccine  strain  was  similar  between  002  and  007  (all  95%  CI overlap). At least 98% were seropositive with respect to the vaccine strain while the seropositivity rate with respect to the heterologous strain was numerically higher in 002. The seroconversion rates were numerically or (borderline) significantly greater with respect to homologous and heterologous strains, respectively,  in  study  002.  However,  the  GMTs  were  the  same  between  studies  for  each  of  the homologous and heterologous strains and about 4-fold higher for the former than for the latter strain.

At D180 in 007 all except one subject was seropositive for NA against the vaccine strain in the 3.8 μ g HA/AS03  vaccine  group  with  a  seropositivity  rate  of  98%  and  seroconversion  rate  of  72%.  The corresponding rates for the heterologous strain were 82% and 40%.

Overall,  4,002  healthy  subjects  (minimum  age  18  years)  were  exposed  to  H5N1  AS03  adjuvanted vaccine in studies 007 and 008 i.e. total across all doses. More than 3800 of these subjects received an HA dose ≥ 15 µg i.e. at least 4-fold the HA dose in the intended marketed formulation. Another 961 subjects aged 18-60 years received at least one dose of Third series 3.8 μ g/AS03 vaccine in study 002 and were included in the safety evaluation.

NA against vaccine strain and H5N1 A/Indonesia/5/2005 in adults aged 18-60 years in H5N1-002 and H5N1-007 (ATP immunogenicity cohort) NA data in the age group 18-60 years are not yet available from study 008 but in subjects aged &gt; 60 years the D42 NA data for the vaccine strain showed that all those tested were seropositive and 67% had seroconverted with a GMT of 384, which compares well with the value of 308 in the younger subjects in study 002 despite the difference in pre-vaccination seropositivity rates. These data strongly suggest that most or all subjects in study 002 will still be seropositive for NA with respect  to  the  vaccine  strain  at  D180  and  probably  around  80%  will  be  seropositive  for  the heterologous strain. However proportions with titres of at least 1:40 or 1:80 will be lower. As for HI, it is not known how having NA titres at these levels may correlate with protection against a pandemic strain at or beyond D180. Clinical safety Solicited symptoms were recorded during the 7-day follow-up period after each dose together with any analgesics  and/or  antipyretics  taken.  Unsolicited  symptoms  occurring  during  a  21-day  follow-up period after the first vaccination and 30 days after the second one were also recorded in the CRF.

## AEs in study H5N1-007

The incidence of symptoms, and in particular local symptoms, was higher in the groups vaccinated with adjuvanted formulations. No significant effect of the antigen dose or consistent trend by dose was observed on the overall incidence of symptoms among the adjuvanted vaccines.

Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local symptom in all groups (e.g. 86% in the 3.8 µg/AS03 group). The incidence was significantly higher in groups given adjuvanted vaccines (8692% after dose 1 and 69-80% after dose 2 compared to 28-50% and 22-40% after respective doses in the groups given non-adjuvanted vaccines). There was also a trend for higher incidences of swelling and redness in groups with adjuvanted vaccines and the rate of induration was significantly higher in adjuvanted groups. However, severe swelling, redness and induration were all reported at low rates.

The most frequently reported general symptoms were fatigue and headache. For all of the solicited general symptoms there was at least a trend for higher incidence in groups that received adjuvanted vaccines. For example, myalgia reported as being vaccine-related was reported for 10-20% in the nonadjuvanted vaccine groups but 36-44.9% with adjuvanted vaccines. Fever was reported with a very low incidence in all groups and no fever above 39°C was reported. Lymphadenopathy followed administration of 7.5 µg HA (3 cases), 15 µg HA (3 cases) and 30 µg HA (1 case) adjuvanted vaccines. Six of these 7 cases were considered to be related to vaccination. No reports  of  local  lymph  node  swelling  were  of  grade  3  severity  and  all  subjects  recovered  without sequelae. AEs in study H5N1-008 The highest incidence of any severe symptom after vaccination with 15 µg/AS03 vaccine (16.3%) was reported by subjects aged 18 to 60 years after the first dose. After the first injection, severe symptoms were  reported  more  frequently  in  subjects  aged  18-60  years  than  in  those  &gt;  60  years  but  after  the second injection  there  was  little  difference  between  the  age  strata.  Severe  symptoms  were  reported with a significantly lower incidence in subjects vaccinated with Fluarix and placebo. Among solicited local symptoms pain was the most frequently reported AE in both treatment groups and age strata but was reported with a significantly higher incidence in subjects vaccinated with 15 µg/AS03 than  in  subjects  vaccinated  with  Fluarix  or  placebo.  Pain  was  predominantly  reported  by subjects aged between 18 and 60 years. In the 15 µg/AS03 group general symptoms were reported more frequently in those aged 18-60 years than in those aged &gt; 60 years. The most common symptoms were fatigue, headache and myalgia in both treatment groups and age strata.

In  both  vaccine  groups  subjects  aged  18  -  60  years  more  frequently  reported  unsolicited  symptoms than  those  aged  &gt;  60  years.  The  most  common  symptoms  were  injection  site  pruritus  and  warmth, influenza like illness and related symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhoea, nausea). There were 95 AE reports coded as the MedDRA preferred terms lymphadenopathy, lymph node pain or lymphadenitis,  of  which  84/95  occurred  in  the  15µg/AS03  group.  These  subjects  were  more  likely than others to report other general symptoms.

Based  on  the  applicant's  assessment  from  D51  to  D180  there  were  16  subjects  in  the  15µg/AS03 group  and  three  in  the  Fluarix  group  who  reported  17  and  3  unsolicited  symptoms,  respectively, classified as new onset chronic diseases (NOCD). There was no clear disease pattern identified. Summary of new onset chronic diseases (GSK assessment) reported (Total vaccinated cohort) HN AS03 = H5N1 15µg HA + AS03, Fluarix = Fluarix/ (Placebo at the 2 nd  dose) s18     = 18-60 years, s61     = 61-120 years * Symptoms reported by a subject after a given dose and classified by the same Preferred Term are counted once Also, 64 subjects in the 15µg/AS03 group and 14 in the Fluarix group reported 75 and 17 unsolicited symptoms, respectively, classified as medically significant conditions. Summary of medically significant conditions (GSK assessment) reported (Total vaccinated cohort) AEs in study H5N1-002 These are  the  safety  data  most  relevant  to  the  use  of  the  commercial  product  in  adults  aged  18-60 years. However, there were no consistent differences in AEs reported in this study compared to those reported with the 3.8 µg/AS03 vaccine used in study 007. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The next table shows the incidence of solicited local symptoms over the 7-day follow-up period after vaccination overall by subject. Subjects in the adjuvanted groups frequently reported pain, swelling and redness with generally similar rates across the four groups. Rates were much lower in the nonadjuvanted vaccine groups in which no grade 3 local symptoms were reported.

In study  H5N1-007 there  were  no  deaths  or  non-fatal  SAEs  up  to  D51.  From  D51  to  D180  seven subjects reported a SAE, ranging from 0-2 per dose group but none was considered to be related to vaccination.

For  solicited  general  symptoms  myalgia  and  fatigue  were  reported  frequently  by  subjects  in  the adjuvanted vaccine groups (myalgia in &gt; 60% in adjuvanted groups but 20-30% in non-adjuvanted; fatigue in 50-60% compared to 30-40%). Unsolicited symptoms were reported by 383 subjects with rates across all six groups in the range 2835%.  The  most  frequently  reported  unsolicited  symptoms  tended  to  be  associated  with  likely intercurrent  illnesses  affecting  the  respiratory  and  gastrointestinal  tracts  and  so  were  very  varied  in nature. · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events Medicinal Product no longer authorised

In study H5N1-008 there were 11/3802 (0.3%) subjects in the 15µg/AS03 vaccine group and 6/1269 (0.5%) in the Fluarix/placebo group who reported SAEs. All SAEs were considered as not related to vaccination by the investigator and all resolved. There were no deaths.

Between  D51  and  D180  3.8%  of  those  aged  &gt;  60  years  in  the  15µg/AS03  group  reported  a  SAE compared to 3.9% in this age group from the Fluarix group. Rates in subjects aged 18-60 years were 0.8% and 0.9% in the two vaccine groups. There was no discernible pattern in SAEs observed. In the 15µg/AS03 vaccine group none of the SAEs seemed likely to be in any way related to vaccination based on nature or date of onset.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In study H5N1-002 there were seven subjects who reported SAEs during the study. Review of these SAEs indicates that none was related to vaccine. One subject died while on duty as a fireman.

- Safety in special populations

There is no experience in children. For further information, see SPC section 5.1.

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

There are no data on co-administration of Prepandrix with other vaccines.

The manufacture of the H5N1 antigen, the H5N1 formulated vial and the AS03 (adjuvant) vial are appropriately controlled. Adequate release and shelf life specifications have been set. Commitments are made by the applicant to update some missing information, which does not impact on the risk/benefit assessment of this vaccine.

· Discontinuation due to adverse events There were no discontinuations due to AEs in study 007. In 008 three subjects who received 15µg/AS03 vaccine dropped out due to a SAEs assessed as not related  to  vaccination.  In  addition,  22  subjects  reported  non  serious  AEs  that  led  to  premature discontinuation from the study. Of these 21 were from the 15µg/AS03 group (9 by day 21) and there was only one withdrawal from the Fluarix group (by Day 42). After review the applicant concluded that there was an excess of AEs associated with withdrawal in the adjuvanted vaccine group but no pattern of AEs associated with withdrawals could be discerned. In 002 the only early discontinuation was due to the death that was unrelated to the vaccine. · Post marketing experience There is no post-marketing experience at present. 2.5. Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfilled the legislative requirements. Risk Management Plan The MAA submitted a risk management plan that was drafted in accordance with the CHMP core RMP for vaccines intended for use from WHO Phase 3 onwards. 2.6.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The ability  to  induce  protection  against  homologous  and  heterologous  vaccine  strains  was  assessed non-clinically using ferret challenge models.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of animals receiving adjuvanted vaccine 87% and 96% were protected against the lethal homologous or  heterologous  challenge,  respectively.  Viral  shedding  into  the  upper  respiratory  tract  was  also reduced in vaccinated animals relative to controls, suggesting a reduced risk of viral transmission.  In the unadjuvanted control group, as well as in the adjuvant control group, all animals died or had to be euthanized as they were moribund, three to four days after the start of challenge.

Non-clinical safety data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, embryo-foetal and postnatal toxicity (up to the end of the lactation period).

## Efficacy

Clinical trials to assess protective efficacy are not possible and so a detailed characterisation of the immunological response has been performed. Study 007 supported the choice of an adjuvanted formulation and the use of the lowest tested dose of HA antigen for further assessment. The immunogenicity data in subjects aged 18-60 years were similar between studies 007 (using vaccine from a preliminary production process) and 002 (using vaccine from the final production process). The CHMP criteria for HI responses are fulfilled following administration of two doses of  Prepandrix administered 21 days apart to subjects aged 18-60 years. Based on the data from study 008 and the lack of a significant effect of dose on responses to the adjuvanted formulations tested in 007 it is anticipated that responses in subjects aged &gt; 60 years would be at least as good as those in younger subjects. The NA data are supportive of the HI data. The available data at D180 indicate as expected a waning of antibody titres. However, more than half were still seroprotected based on HI titres and almost all were seropositive based on NA. The influenza-specific T-cell data are supportive of the immunogenicity of the vaccine. Antibody and T-cell responses to clade 2 strains were lower than to the vaccine strain. The applicant has committed to continue to assess the cross-reactivity and cross-protection elicited by Prepandrix against newly drifted strains of H5N1. Safety In study 007 addition of the AS03 adjuvant clearly increased the reactogenicity of the various HA doses tested but there was no significant effect of the antigen dose on the overall incidence of symptoms among the adjuvanted vaccines. Across the studies pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local symptom. There was also a trend for higher incidences of swelling and redness in groups with adjuvanted vaccines and the  rate  of  induration  was  significantly  higher  in  adjuvanted  groups.  However,  severe  swelling, redness and induration were all reported at low rates. Regional lymphadenopathy may also occur. The most frequently reported general symptoms were fatigue and headache. All SAEs were considered as not related to vaccination by the investigator. There was one unrelated death across all studies. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

The applicant has committed to perform a further round of user testing with the final approved PL in the post-authorisation period.

## Risk-benefit assessment

## Clinical context

Prepandrix is intended for use before the onset of the next declared pandemic. Therefore it is intended for use in a non-emergency situation and as such should be evaluated in the same framework as other vaccines intended for the prevention of clinically apparent infections following post-vaccination exposure. Benefits The real benefit of Prepandrix vaccine will only be demonstrated once data can be collected during a pandemic situation. At present the benefit of Prepandrix can only be assumed from the data on the immunological  responses  elicited  following  a  primary  series  against  the  vaccine  strain  and  against antigenically drifted strains of influenza A/H5N1 virus.. The expected benefit of Prepandrix is to provide some protection against clinically apparent infection and/or severe disease in case of an influenza pandemic. This is based on an assumption that vaccination with Prepandrix containing antigens derived from A/Vietnam /1194/2004 will provide a clinically useful degree of cross-protection against the strain that causes the next pandemic. To a great extent it is also based on the assumption that the next pandemic will be triggered by influenza A og H5N1, which may not be the case. For these reasons the applicant has committed to continue to evaluate cross-reactivity and cross-protection in the post-authorisation period against emerging strains considered to have some potential to cause a pandemic. Risks Prepandrix is commonly or very commonly associated with a range of local and systemic adverse reactions but these are not often of severe intensity and the safety profile would not preclude the use of the vaccine in healthy adults aged 18-60 years or &gt; 60 years. The  current  safety  database  is  considered  to  be  sufficient  to  describe  adverse  reactions  that  occur uncommonly and to give an indication of any rare events. However, there are some adverse reactions known to be very rarely associated with influenza vaccines and it is currently not possible to predict if higher  rates  might  be  observed  with  Prepandrix  compared  with,  for  example,  seasonal  influenza vaccines. Balance Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Taking into consideration the anticipated mode of use and subject to appropriate amendments of the SPC the benefit to risk relationship is considered to be favourable. However, this conclusion is fundamentally based on the assumption that the HI and NA data indicate the likelihood that some degree of protection would be afforded against an ultimate pandemic strain.

## Conclusions

The overall B/R of  Prepandrix is positive.

A risk management plan was submitted in accordance with the CHMP-recommended core RMP for these types of vaccines when intended for use in the pre-pandemic period.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Prepandrix  for  the  active  immunisation  against  H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
