## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Olanzapine,  a  thienobenzodiazepine  derivative  (selective  monoaminergic  antagonist),  is  an  atypical antipsychotic  developed  by  Eli  Lilly  and  Company  (Lilly).  Oral  olanzapine  for  the  treatment  of schizophrenia  received  United  States  (US)  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  approval  30 September 1996 and European Union (EU) approval on 27 September 1996. Oral olanzapine is also indicated  for  the  treatment  of  acute  mixed  or  manic  episodes  associated  with  bipolar  I  disorder. Additionally, a rapid-acting intramuscular (RAIM) injection formulation of olanzapine, indicated for agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar I mania, received approval in the US on 29 March 2004 and in the EU on 2 July 2001. The current application is for a depot formulation of olanzapine: olanzapine  pamoate  monohydrate  (the  salt  of  pamoic  acid  and  olanzapine),  suitable  for  deep intramuscular  (IM)  injection.  Olanzapine  Pamoate  (OP)  Depot  consists  of  olanzapine  pamoate monohydrate  powder,  which  is  suspended  in  an  aqueous  vehicle  immediately  prior  to  use.  Non compliance is an important issue with schizophrenic patients, and abrupt withdrawal of treatment can lead to dramatic consequences. The Depot formulation has been developed to improve compliance in schizophrenic patients.

## The initially sought indication was

Treatment of schizophrenia. ZYPADHERA is effective in the treatment of patients who have previously been exposed to oral olanzapine.

Maintenance  treatment  of  schizophrenia.  ZYPADHERA  is  effective  in  maintaining  the  clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response to oral olanzapine.

However, further to discussion with the CHMP (see Discussion on Efficacy), the applicant agreed to change the indication to

Maintenance treatment of adult patients with schizophrenia sufficiently stabilised during acute treatment with oral olanzapine.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

This  product  has  been  developed  as  a  sterile  powder  with  viscous  vehicle  and  is  intended  for intramuscular injection.

## Active Substance

Olanzapine  pamoate  monohydrate  (INN:  olanzapine)  exists  as  a  yellow  solid.  Physico-chemical properties  such  as  solubility  (very  low  in  most  solvents),  pKa,  melting  point  have  been  adequately detailed.

Several hydrated forms of olanzapine pamoate have been identified including the monohydrate crystal form (commercial form) and two different non- stoichiometric hydrates.

Thermogravimetric analysis and solid-state NMR spectroscopy were used to determine the presence of water  or  solvent,  and  to  calculate  the  hydrate  or  solvate  stoichiometry.  X-ray  analysis  allowed  to differentiate the monohydrate from the non-stoichiometric hydrate and dehydrate forms and to confirm that the active substance is only found as the monohydrate crystal form. Based on thermal analysis, the dehydration of olanzapine pamoate occurred at high temperature (above 100C) indicating the water of crystallisation is strongly bonded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Manufacture

The synthesis of the active substance consists of the formation of the salt, starting from olanzapine and pamoic acid, followed by crystallisation, drying and milling to the desired particle size, and mixing in a blender to achieve the active substance, olanzapine pamoate monohydrate.

Suitable  specifications  are  presented  for  starting  materials,  solvents  and  reagents  as  well  as  critical process parameters (CPPs) and in-process controls. Critical process parameters (CPPs), are parameters which are known or expected to affect the critical quality attributes of the active substance.

The proven acceptable ranges (PAR) have been determined using development experience. Since the crystallization is a one-step process, there are no intermediates.

During manufacturing process development, the following quality attributes for the active substance were studied: crystal form, particle size distribution, purity/impurity profile.

A Quality by Design Approach for the development program was retained and the development was focused on the robustness and control of the method of manufacturing.

The chemical structure has been fully elucidated using adequate methods including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), mass spectroscopy (MS), elemental analysis, X-ray crystallography, and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The structure of the active substance was also based on the route of synthesis.

The proposed approach to control and qualify the impurities was considered adequate.  A comprehensive impurity profile was described. Origin of the synthesis related impurities and reaction pathways  of  the  major  degradation  products  were  properly  discussed.  The  level  of  impurities  was satisfactorily controlled.

## · Specification

Satisfactory specification for the active substance included parameters such as identification (IR and HPLC), identification of the crystal form (X-Ray), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents  (GC),  sulphated  ash  (Ph.Eur.),  appearance,  water  content  (Karl-Fisher),  particle  size  (laser method), specific surface area (Nitrogen Adsorption), bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur.), microbial quality (Ph.Eur.),  and  particulate  matter.  Limits  set  up  for  the  impurities  and  the  residual  solvents  are acceptable and in line with ICH guidelines.

Analytical methods have been appropriately described and non-compendial analytical methods such as methods  for  identity,  assay,  determination  of  related  substances  and  residual  solvents  have  been satisfactorily  validated  in  accordance  with  ICH  requirements.  The  proposed  analytical  methods  are considered adequate for their intended use.

Batch  analysis  results  have  been  provided  for  nine  production-scale  batches  of  olanzapine  pamoate monohydrate . Additionally,  nine  pilot-scale  batches  were  also  tested.  All  results  met  the  proposed specifications.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Container closure: The active substance is kept in a container made of stainless steel and a bottom valve with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) diaphragm. Certificates of Analysis have been provided for the  packaging  materials.  The  container  closure  system  is  considered  adequate  and  is  supported  by stability data.

## · Stability

Stability  studies  have  been  conducted  on  three  commercial  batches  under  ICH  conditions  (up  to  24 months  at  25 ° C/65%  RH  and  6  months  at  40 ° C/75%  RH).  The  following  parameters  were  studied: appearance, crystal form, assay, related substances, water content, particle size, bacterial endotoxins, and microbial quality. The analytical methods are considered as adequate.

In  addition,  stress  testing  studies  were  performed  to  understand  the  intrinsic  stability  of  the  active substance under various conditions (heat, light, humidity, and different pH conditions). These studies showed that olanzapine is sensitive and degradation was observed under acid and basic conditions, light exposure, and oxidative conditions.

The active substance was shown to be stable when kept in the commercial container under long-term and accelerated conditions. No significant trend was observed for any of the tested parameters. All physicochemical and pharmaceutical parameters remained within the authorised limits. Stability data support the proposed re-test period.when stored in the commercial stainless steel container closure system.

## Medicinal Product

The primary packaging consists of: a vial containing olanzapine pamoate salt (no excipient), as yellow powder (equivalent to 210 mg, 300 mg, or 405 mg of olanzapine base), and a vial of single-use sterile, viscous liquid.

Immediately prior to administration, the aqueous vehicle is combined with the olanzapine powder to form a suspension for intramuscular injection (olanzapine pamoate depot). The olanzapine pamoate suspension has a target concentration of 150 mg/ml olanzapine base for all dosage strengths.

## · Pharmaceutical Development

## Olanzapine pamoate powder:

The pharmaceutical development of the powder has been appropriately detailed and the choice of the olanzapine  pamoate  salt  was  justified  based  on  its  low  aqueous  solubility  for  drug  release,  low hygroscopicity, chemical and physical stability a well as from manufacturing and terminal sterilization point of view.

No excipient was used with the active substance powder.

The formulation development aimed to be a parenteral suspension product that would optimize the suspension concentration and minimize the injection volume for the three strengths, namely 210 mg, 300 mg, and 405 mg. The volume of injection was determined to be between 0.5 ml to 3 ml, which is relevant to intramuscular injection. The viscosity of suspension was taken into account to allow the suspension to be easily drawn into a syringe and injected.

To achieve the same concentration,  a  different  amount  of  vehicle  was  used  to  suspend  each  of  the three doses. The suspension and dosing strategy has been confirmed in clinical studies.

Overage has been applied and justified: an excess of the active substance was included to ensure the targeted dose to be administered.

The manufacturing development has been sufficiently detailed and a real-time control approach was selected. The proposed technology provides real-time dose control of the commercial filling process. A Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) was performed on the technology application in order to minimize or control manufacturing process factors that could affect the drug product filling process controls. The FMEA analysis provided commercial filling line improvements

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Also, electron beam terminal sterilisation was selected since the container closure system was unstable under dry heat processing conditions and moist heat sterilization was inappropriate for a dry powder formulation.  Furthermore,  in  relation  to  the  microbiological  attributes,  the  sterilization  method  is justified for the proposed pharmaceutical form.

In  summary,  it  has  been  confirmed  that  the  composition  of  manufactured  drug  product  batches  for toxicology and clinical studies has remained the same for all dosages of the present medicinal product.

In  conclusion,  the  manufacturing  process  development  was  adequately  described  and  the  proposed final commercial process involving crystallisation, dry-powder filling and terminal sterilisation leads to a finished product of consistent quality.

## Vehicle

The formulation development of the vehicle was aimed to a stable solution that would allow the drug product to be easily suspended and injected.

All excipients comply with their respective Ph.Eur. monographs. The following excipients were used: carboxymethylcellulose  sodium  (carmellose  sodium),  mannitol,  polysorbate  80,  water  for  injection, sodium hydroxide solution 10%, hydrochloric acid solution 10%.

Development  studies  have  demonstrated  that  all  manufacturing  processes  of  the  drug  product formulation  have  provided  comparable  chemical,  physical,  and  microbiological  control  during manufacturing and throughout the drug product shelf life. Batches used in the clinical studies and for the stability studies were obtained by the final manufacturing process

An overfill has been retained for the vehicle to ensure withdrawal of the correct amount of vehicle.

The  manufacturing  process  development  has  been  adequately  detailed  In  addition,  the  choice  of sterilization  method  (terminal  sterilisation  under  moist  heat  conditions)  is  justified  for  the  present vehicle and parenteral injection.

The choice of containers for the powder and the vehicle (5 ml, type I glass vials closed by butyl rubber stoppers) has been discussed. The glass vial complies with Ph.Eur. monograph 3.2.1 Glass Containers for  Pharmaceutical  Use  and  the  stopper  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  monograph  3.2.9,  Rubber  Closures  for Containers for Aqueous Parenteral Preparations for Powders and Freeze-Dried Powders.

## · Adventitious Agents

No excipients of animal or human origin have been used in the manufacture of the vehicle.

## · Manufacture of the Product

Appropriate in-process controls have been applied.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Process Validation and/or Evaluation

Process validation has been performed on three production-scale batches of powder (one batch for each strength,  manufactured  according  to  the  commercial  process.  All  batches  were  conform  to  the specifications at all tested time points and sampling positions. Prior to the release of the drug product to  the  marketplace,  the  manufacturing  process  will  be  validated  which  is  acceptable  for  a  terminal sterilisation process.

The  process  validation  of  the  proposed  terminal  sterilization  for  the  powder  has  been  described  in detail. Sterility for all manufacturing batches at release has been demonstrated. In addition, the drug product has been shown to remain sterile through 24 months. Furthermore, based on the results, no degradation  products  are  found  as  a  result  of  irradiation  and  the  total  degradation  products  do  not increase with repeat doses of radiation. Therefore the drug product terminally sterilized using electron beam irradiation is proven to be stable during storage.

The process validation of the terminal sterilization (for the vehicle) has been satisfactorily detailed.

- Stability of the Product

## Stability of the powder

Stability studies have been carried out on 10 pilot batches kept in the commercial packaging under ICH conditions (results available until 12 months at 30 C/65%RH and 6 months at 40 C/75%RH).

° ° The  physical  and  chemical  properties  of  the  drug  product  demonstrated  in  the  solid  state  stability studies afford similar drug product stability when suspended in the vehicle. The data provided indicate that  minimal  stability  changes  are  expected  as  a  drug  product  in  the  suspension  state  intended  for immediate  use  for  up  to  24  hours.  The  observed  physical  changes  (suspension  state  particle  size, injection  efficiency)  in  the  suspension  are  minimal  and  seem  to  have  no  impact  on  clinical performance. In summary, stability of the drug product has been studied in the solid state (powder) and in the suspension state and the stability protocol agreed.

Parameters studied included physical appearance (description), assay, degradation product content, in vitro dissolution, injectability, bacterial endotoxins, particulate matter and sterility.

Supporting stability studies on twelve batches (obtained by an earlier development process for clinical trials) are also available after 24 months at 30 ° C/65%RH and up to 36 months at 25 ° C/60%RH.

Stability results showed that no significant degradation trend could be observed and the results remain within the specification. Results support the shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC for the powder and the final suspension.

## Stability of the drug product vehicle (solvent)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Separate stability studies have been conducted on the vehicle on three commercial batches kept in the commercial packaging under ICH conditions (results available until 12 months at 30 ° C/65%RH and 6 months at 40 ° C/75%RH).

Parameters studied included physical appearance, colour and clarity, pH, viscosity, particulate matter, bacterial endotoxin, and sterility.

No significant change could be observed during the stability studies.

Results support the shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC for the vehicle.

Photostability  studies  conducted  under  ICH  conditions  have  demonstrated  that  the  drug  product  is stable in the solid and suspension states when kept in the commercial packaging.

## Discussion on chemical and pharmaceutical aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance olanzapine pamoate and the drug product olanzapine depot formulation has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of the important product quality characteristics and in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

As the pharmacology of olanzapine is not expected to be altered by the method of administration, the pharmacology dossier submitted to support the MAA of Zypadhera is mainly based on the findings reported  in  the  dossier  for  oral  olanzapine.  Some  secondary  pharmacodynamics  studies  were conducted  to  investigate  the  effect  of  olanzapine  treatment  on  body  weight  and  development  of diabetes. The set of safety pharmacology studies was completed to include data relative to the ability of olanzapine to block cardiac ion channels.

## Pharmacology

- Primary pharmacodynamics

The  applicant  refers  to  the  primary  pharmacodynamics  findings  reported  in  the  MAA  for  oral olanzapine. It is indicated that the receptor binding profile of olanzapine has been expanded to include additional receptor subtypes.

Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic with a broad binding and pharmacological profile. In  vitro , olanzapine showed medium-to-high affinity (Ki &lt;100 nM) for dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4.2, D5, serotonin 5-HT2A,  5-HT2C,  5-HT3,  5-HT6, α 1 -adrenergic,  histamine  H1,  and  5  muscarinic  receptor  subtypes. Olanzapine  had  lower  affinity  for α 2 -adrenergic  receptors  and  relatively  low  affinity  for  5-HT1 subtypes,  GABAA, β -adrenergic,  and  benzodiazepine  binding  sites.  Overall,  the  binding  profile  of olanzapine  is  very  similar  to  that  produced  by  clozapine,  although  the  affinity  of  olanzapine  is somewhat higher at dopamine receptors and lower at α 2-adrenergic receptors.

Additional in vitro and in vivo biochemical pharmacology studies with olanzapine confirmed potent 5HT2A/2C,  dopamine  D1,  D2,  and  muscarinic  antagonist  activity.  Of  particular  interest  were  studies demonstrating that olanzapine antagonized quipazine-induced (5-HT receptor agonist) and pergolideinduced (dopamine D2 agonist) increases in corticosterone in rats. These results show that olanzapine has more potent activity at 5-HT receptors than at dopamine D2 receptors in vivo.

In  electrophysiological  tests,  when rats  were  dosed  orally  with olanzapine  for  21  days,  there  was a decrease in the firing rate of mesolimbic dopamine neurons (A10 cells), whereas the activity of the neurons  of  the  striatal  system  (A9  cells)  was  either  unaffected  or  increased  (see  figure  2).  Thus, olanzapine  preferentially  modified  the  brain  mesolimbic  dopaminergic  system  suggesting  that  this compound could be less likely to produce extrapyramidal side effects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  vivo ,  olanzapine  blocked  conditioned  avoidance  in  rats  at  lower  oral  doses  than  those  which produced catalepsy, increased punished responding in conflict models, and substituted for clozapine in a drug discrimination assay.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

Literature reports suggest that long term use of atypical antipsychotic drugs is involved in the risk for development of adverse metabolic effects including glucose intolerance/diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia,  hyperleptinemia,  and  weight  gain  (Melkersson  et  al,  2004,  Newcomer  2007).  The underlying  mechanisms  are  not  yet  fully  understood  but  some  authors  showed  that  atypical antipsychotics  directly  modulate  insulin  action  and  metabolic  processes  in  insulin  target  tissues including  insulin-stimulated  glucose  transport  in  adipocytes  and  skeletal  muscle  cells  (Vestri  et  al. 2007, Engl et al. 2005).

From  2001  to  2007,  the  applicant  studied  the  effect  of  olanzapine  treatment  on  body  weight  and development of diabetes.

Subcutaneous administration of olanzapine to female rats with osmotic mini-pumps for 10 to 19 days produced  a  significant  compound-associated  increase  in  weight  gain  over  vehicle-treated  animals (studies CNS590 and CNS371). However, male rats treated the same way, did not show increases in weight gain.

In another study (no. PsD32), oral administration of olanzapine to female rats (0.2 mg/kg, 31 days) also produced a significant compound-associated increase in weight gain which was due to a specific increase in fat mass as opposed to fat-free mass. Concomitant oral treatment of rats with olanzapine and 2.5 mg/kg cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptor antagonist for 12 days caused a reduction in fat mass, but did not modify body weight or food intake.

Another study (no. PsD33) determined if a CB1 receptor antagonist could prevent treatment-emergent weight gain associated with olanzapine. The CB1 receptor antagonist, when dosed orally together with olanzapine, was able to attenuate olanzapine treatment-emergent weight gain although this effect was not  significantly  different  compared  to  olanzapine  treatment  alone.  Similarly,  concomitant  oral treatment of rats with olanzapine and a pan-opiate antagonist for 15 days (following 15 days of oral treatment with olanzapine alone) reversed the body fat gain to vehicle treated levels (study PsD36).

To  determine  if  olanzapine  treatment  would  potentiate  development  of  diabetes,  7  week  old  male Zucker  diabetic  fatty  rats  were  treated  with  olanzapine  before  these  animals  became  diabetic. Olanzapine  did  not  accelerate  development  of  hyperglycemia  and  hypoinsulinemia  in  this  model (study CNS378).

Two final studies were done to examine potential causes of the olanzapine treatment emergent weight gain. The first used female Sprague Dawley rats treated with subcutaneous olanzapine in a pamoatesustained delivery system, and plasma ghrelin levels were examined. These results demonstrated that olanzapine-induced increases  in  food  consumption and  body  weight  are  not  secondary  to  increased plasma ghrelin levels (study no. ALW01). The final study was done because it has been demonstrated that antipsychotic drugs which produce weight gain increase Fos expression in a high percentage of orexin-containing neurons of the lateral hypothalamus. Olanzapine produced a significant increase in the percentage of orexin cells that also expressed Fos relative to vehicle (study CNS562).

## · Safety pharmacology programme

In earlier studies safety pharmacology of olanzapine has been well characterized. The main findings regarding  the  cardiovascular  system  showed  that  olanzapine,  as  other  antipsychotic  agents,  dosedependently blocks the cloned equivalent of the delayed rectifier potassium current IKr with an IC50 amounting to 0.231 µM. Other ionic currents were blocked at higher concentrations. The risk of QTc prolongation  is  adequately  reported  in  SPC  section  4.4.  In  addition,  hypotension  was  observed  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

anaesthetized rats and dogs administered an IV bolus (0.1 mg/kg), but not in conscious rats treated orally at 10 mg/kg. The risk of hypotension is addressed in various sections of the SmPC.

Other studies conducted by the oral route were already evaluated; among other CNS effects reported in mice, some findings suggest a proconvulsive activity of olanzapine.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No  specific  pharmacodynamic  studies  to  evaluate  drug  interactions  have  been  conducted.  This  is acceptable as the results of clinical drug interaction studies performed with oral and RAIM olanzapine are a sufficient reliable characterization of what to expect with OP Depot in similar situations.

## Pharmacokinetics

Olanzapine  has  been  extensively  evaluated  as  an  oral  agent  and  as  a  rapid  acting  IM  agent.  The absorption and exposure of olanzapine and/or pamoic acid following administration of OP Depot in rats,  rabbits  and  dogs  were  conducted  in  support  of  current  application.  The  primary  evaluation  of olanzapine pamoate has focused on the absorption of the salt form, as other aspects of the disposition (distribution, metabolism, excretion, etc) would be expected to remain unchanged once the compound is absorbed.

## Absorption

In  rat,  dog,  and  rabbit,  OP  Depot  produced  initial  peak  plasma  concentrations  of  olanzapine  and pamoate  followed  by  a  gradual  decline  in  concentrations  for  up  to  28  days  postdose.  Plasma concentrations of olanzapine following the administration of OP Depot increased with increasing dose. Plasma concentrations of pamoic acid were greater following the administration of pamoic acid alone compared  to  the  administration  of  OP  Depot.  The  plasma  profiles  of  pamoic  acid  following administration of OP Depot were qualitatively similar to those obtained following administration of pamoic  acid  alone.  Studies  compared  the  maximum  exposure  to  olanzapine  in  rats  and  dogs respectively, following administration of oral olanzapine (daily) or OP Depot either once/4 weeks in rats or once/2 weeks in dogs. During an 8-week period, male rats given oral olanzapine were exposed to 9.1 times more olanzapine and female rats were exposed to 13.4 times more olanzapine than rats given 3 IM injections of the highest feasible dose of OP Depot. Additionally, male dogs in the oral study following 6 months of treatment were exposed to 9.9 times more olanzapine and female dogs were  exposed  to  6.4  times  more  olanzapine  than  the  dogs  in  the  6-month  olanzapine  pamoate monohydrate study following 13 injections of IM OP Depot.

Thus,  the  relative  lack  of  systemic  toxicity  in  the  nonclinical  toxicology  studies  with  olanzapine pamoate monohydrate is to be expected based on lower levels of exposure.

Comparison of olanzapine plasma exposure in rat and dog following administration of oral olanzapine versus intramuscular administration of OP Depot showed slower absorption of olanzapine (a single dose of OP Depot) in dogs (Tmax approximately 3 to 6 days) compared with absorption in rats and rabbits (Tmax under 24 hr).  The Applicant was invited by the CHMP to comment the reasons for this interspecies variation in absorption rate. The argumentation was that this variability is likely due to multiple physiological and physical factors including differences in the placement of the injection, the size  of  the  muscle  mass  being  injected  (larger  in  dog  than  in  rat),  the  blood  flow  to  the  region  of injection,  and  the  different  species  themselves,  all  of  which  could  contribute  to  variable  absorption from the site. Regardless of this variability, the overall pharmacokinetic pattern is however predictable in  all  species,  with  absorption  to  Tmax  in  a  comparatively  short  period  of  time  (hours  or  days), followed by sustained exposure over weeks, which is expected of an IM depot administration. The CHMP accepted the reasoning of the applicant.

## Distribution

The distribution of orally administered olanzapine in laboratory animals has been well characterized. Olanzapine is widely distributed throughout the body, with a Tmax of 2 hours for the majority of tissues in the single-dose study and is cleared relatively quickly; by 96 hours after dosing, most tissues had  non  detectable  levels  of  radioactivity.  Olanzapine  half-lives  ranged  from  approximately  3  to  9

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hours. Olanzapine was shown to have a fairly high degree of binding to plasma proteins in each of the species examined. The mean plasma protein binding of 14C-olanzapine ranged from 58% to 63% in the cynomolgus monkey, 72% to 77% in the dog, 71% to 81% in the mouse, 80% to 85% in the rhesus monkey, and 84% to 91% in the rat. Pregnant rats given oral doses of 14C-olanzapine on Gestation Day 12 or 18 had high levels of radioactivity in most maternal tissues, but very low levels ( ≤ 0.04% of the dose) were detected in fetal tissues.

No distribution studies were conducted with olanzapine pamoate monohydrate as the distribution of olanzapine  following  i.m.  administration  would  be  substantially  identical  to  that  observed  for  oral olanzapine following absorption.

Standard  distribution,  protein  binding,  or  placental  transfer  studies  for  pamoic  acid  were  not conducted, as these studies were not needed to support toxicology or clinical endpoints. However, a 14C-pamoic acid distribution study was conducted in mice to support genetic toxicology studies. This study demonstrated pamoic acid distribution to bone marrow.

## Metabolism

Metabolism  of  oral  olanzapine  has  been  thoroughly  characterised  in  various  animal  species  and  in human.  Each  species  produced  a  different  major  urinary  metabolite;  in  human  it  was  the  10-N glucuronide. Metabolites of olanzapine were detected also in the plasma of mice, rats and dogs, but the single  largest  entity  was  olanzapine  itself.  In  humans,  olanzapine,  N-10-glucuronide,  N-desmethylolanzapine, the 4'-N-oxide analogue, and the 2-hydroxymethylmetabolite were found. No 7-hydroxyolanzapine was detected in the plasma of humans receiving an oral dose of olanzapine.

In vitro studies have shown that the formation of various metabolites is linked to cytochrome P450 isoform CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and the flavin-containing enzyme known as FMO3.

A non-clinical evaluation of the metabolism of olanzapine following administration of OP Depot was not  conducted,  but  the  metabolic  profile  was  assessed  in  humans.  Overall,  the  olanzapine-related metabolic profiles for human urine and plasma after administration of oral olanzapine and OP Depot were similar.

The metabolism of pamoic acid was assessed both in vivo and in vitro , and the findings showed that there is no metabolism of pamoic acid in rats.

## Excretion

The  excretion  of  14C-labeled  olanzapine  had  been  previously  determined  in  mice,  rats,  dogs, monkeys,  and  humans  and  the  excretion  of  olanzapine  into  the  milk  of  lactating  rats  was  also previously evaluated. Further the excretion of 14C-labeled olanzapine was evaluated in dogs following both  IM  and  intravenous  administration.  Mice,  rats,  and  dogs  eliminated  the  majority  of  the radioactivity  associated  with  a  single  oral  dose  of  14C-olanzapine  into  the  feces.  On  the  contrary, monkeys (and humans) excreted most of the radioactivity from an oral dose via the kidneys. Following a single IM administration of 14C-olanzapine, dogs excreted 46.1% and 42.2% of the radioactivity in the  urine  and  feces,  respectively.  The  majority  of  the  radioactivity  in  the  feces  of  rats  was  due  to extensive biliary excretion. Rats also demonstrated a considerable first-pass effect, as shown by portalversus-systemic plasma measurements, as well as a noteworthy enterohepatic recirculation of biliaryexcreted metabolites.

In a study evaluating the plasma pharmacokinetics of pamoic acid, after a single IM injection of 14Cpamoic  acid  to  male  rats,  residual  radioactivity  in  urine,  faeces,  cage  wash,  and  carcass  was determined by liquid scintillation counting (study 007R02). The mean total recovery of radioactivity was 98.2 % of the administered dose after 168 hours with 97.8 % of the dose recovered after 72 hours. The majority of radioactivity was recovered in faeces, 97.5 % of the dose after 72 hours. Urine, cage wash,  and  carcass  accounted  for  only  approximately  0.3%,  0.11%  and  0.11%,  respectively,  of  the administered radioactivity.

## Toxicology

The  toxicology  development  program  for  olanzapine  pamoate  monohydrate  is  based  on  studies previously  conducted  with  olanzapine.  The  applicant  performed  bridging  studies  in  rats  (3  months) and  dogs  (6  months)  by  the  intramuscular  route  with  OP  Depot,  as  no  qualitative  differences  in metabolites  between  oral  and  depot  forms  is  expected  in  humans.  In  addition,  genotoxicity  studies were performed with pamoic acid, as well as a carcinogenicity study in rats and reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits.

## · Single dose toxicity

Single dose toxicity studies were performed with OP Depot in rats and dogs at doses up to 10 mg and 20  mg/kg.  No  sign  of  systemic  toxicity  was  noted  in  both  species;  the  findings  were  limited  to injection site reactions.

In rats, a chronic inflammation was observed at the injection site, and was consistent with a foreign body reaction. The severity of the lesion decreased post-dosing but remained evident 42 days after the injection.  Similar  findings  were  observed  in  pamoic  acid-treated  rats,  but  the  inflammation  was  of lesser duration.

In  dogs,  chronic  inflammation  with  fibrosis  was  reported  at  the  injection  site.  Both  incidence  and severity of the lesion did not depend on the dose level (5, 10, 20 mg/kg).

## · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Repeat-dose toxicity studies performed with OP Depot were conducted in rats (0, 20, 50, 100 mg/kg/4 weeks, plus a group dosed with pamoic acid at 125 mg/kg/4 weeks, a dose corresponding to that given in the 100 mg/kg/4 weeks OP Depot group, three month duration) and in dogs (0, 5, 10, 20 mg/kg/2 weeks, plus a group dosed with pamoic acid at 25 mg/kg/2 weeks, a dose corresponding to that given in the 20 mg/kg/2 weeks OP Depot group, six month duration).

In rats, a decrease in body weight was noted at 50 and 100 mg/kg (-26% to -39% at 100 mg/kg). This finding  was  already  reported  in  studies  with  oral  olanzapine.  Injection  site  reactions  were  also observed in all treated groups, and consisted of dose-dependent granulomatous inflammation due to the presence of olanzapine and foreign bodies. The atrophy of myocytes, the fibroplasia and increased collagen deposition were graded minimal in severity. From this study, the NOAEL for systemic effects is  20  mg/kg/4  weeks  (decreased  body  weight).  No  NOAEL  could  be  determined  for  injection  site reactions.

In  dogs,  no  systemic  effect  was  noted.  At  the  injection  site,  redness,  swelling  and  ulceration  were reported. At the histopathological level, it corresponded to chronic inflammation. These lesions were dose-dependent  and  generally  resolved  within  2  weeks.  From  this  study,  the  NOAEL  for  systemic effects is 20 mg/kg/2 weeks. No NOAEL could be determined for injection site reactions.

AUC-based exposure multiples ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 in rats,  and  from  0.12 to  0.6 in dogs  at  the NOAEL for systemic toxicity. At the same dose levels, Cmax-based exposure multiples range from 1.8 to 2.7 in rats, and from 0.6 to 1.1 in dogs. As indicated by the applicant, the high-dose levels used in  these  studies  were  limited  by  the  suspension  volume  that  could  be  humanely  injected  and  the maximum suspendable concentration.

## · Genotoxicity

Carcinogenic potential  of  olanzapine  has  been  evaluated  previously  for  the  oral  form  development, and it showed not to be of concern for humans.

Pamoic acid did not show any genotoxic activity in the Ames test, in the mouse lymphoma assay, in a chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes, and in an in vivo micronucleus test in mice. The latter  test  was  conducted  by  IM  route,  at  doses  up  to  586.2  mg/kg  in  males,  and  684.2  mg/kg  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

females.  A  pharmacokinetic  study  adequately  showed  that  pamoic  acid  distributed  to  the  bone marrow.

A positive result was obtained in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay conducted with CHO cells. The incidence of cells with aberrations is increased at 1750 µg/mL, and amounted to 3.5% excluding gaps  and  4.5%  including  gaps  (non  significant  in  the  latter  case).  The  incidence  of  cells  with diplochromosomes reached 13.5%. In a second experiment, the only finding was an increase of the percentage of cells with diplochromosomes (10%, vs. 0% in control group) at 1750 µg/mL. In another study with  extended  cell exposure,  positive  results  are  obtained  from  1250  µg/mL.  At  this concentration level, the percentage of cells with aberrations amounted to 4% excluding gaps (8.5% at 1400 µg/mL). With metabolic activation, positive results are obtained from 900 µg/mL (15.5% cells with aberrations, excluding gaps). Pamoic acid is not metabolized in rats.

Taking account the negative results in 3 other genetic toxicology assays and in the 2-year rat bioassay with olanzapine pamoate monohydrated and pamoic acid, it was concluded that the compound does not constitute a genotoxic or carcinogenic risk to patients.

## · Carcinogenicity

A  study  in  mice  could  not  be  performed  for  technical  reasons  (insufficient  muscle  mass,  needle required was too large).

In rats, no effect of treatment on survival was observed. There were no increases in tumour incidence in  treated  versus  vehicle-control  animals.  Dose-related  increases  in  injection  site  irritation  were observed although the effect was no worse than what was observed in the 3-month study (that is, there was no progression of inflammation). Injection site irritation was generally mild and consistent with what would be expected for a normal inflammatory reaction to a depot injection.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

Two  embryo-fetal  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  with  OP  Depot  and  pamoic  acid.  The  effects observed were limited to injection site reactions in dams. No embryotoxic or teratogenic effect was reported in either rat or rabbit. In both species, the NOELs for maternal systemic toxicity and embryofetal development amounted to 75 mg/kg. In a pre/postnatal toxicity study performed in rats, a lack of habituation to the startle response in the F1 males with a reduced performance on memory trials in the Biel Maze at 75 mg/kg were observed. As indicated by the applicant, these findings were also found in studies  with  oral  olanzapine.  The  NOAEL  for  maternal  systemic  toxicity  reached  amounted  to  75 mg/kg, and the NOAEL for F1 development was 25 mg/kg. As mentioned previously, the high-dose levels used in these studies were limited by the suspension volume that could be humanely injected and the maximum suspendable concentration.

## · Local tolerance

Separate  studies  on  local  tolerance  have  not  been  performed.  However,  injection  sites  of  animals included  in  single  and  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  were  both  clinically  and  histopathologically examined. The primary toxicity of OP Depot in laboratory animals was injection site irritation.

## · Other toxicity studies

No other toxicity studies were performed by the applicant for OP Depot.

The EPAR for Zyprexa mentions that immunotoxicity studies were carried out in a small number of mice  at  dose  of  3  to  45  mg/kg.  Lymphopenia  and  neutropenia  were  seen  at  high  doses.  Overall, immune function was relatively unaltered although an increase in B lymphocyte count and decrease in NK activity in the spleen was shown. It is also indicated that no dependency potential was found with olanzapine in rats and monkeys at doses of 0.05 to 32 mg/kg and 0.06 to 8 mg/kg, respectively, as shown by evaluation of self-administration and physical dependence on olanzapine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  addition,  an  antigenicity  study  was  conducted  in  guinea  pigs.  Active  systemic  anaphylaxis  or passive cutaneous anaphylaxis were not elicited, and olanzapine was judged to have neither antigenic or hapten properties.

No dependency studies were conducted with OP Depot. In studies conducted with oral olanzapine no evidence of olanzapine drug dependence was demonstrated in rats or rhesus monkeys.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Log Kow and Koc values were determined by the applicant. They show that olanzapine has a low potential  for  bioaccumulation  and  is  weakly  adsorbed  in  the  sediment.  In  a  28-day  biodegradation assay in sludge, the half-life of olanzapine was short (DT50 = 7.4 days), whereas it underwent a slow hydrolysis in surface water (&gt; 50 days).

It  can  be  concluded  that  olanzapine  has  no  bioaccumulation  potential.  In  addition,  it  is  rapidly degraded  in  sewage  treatment  plants  (half-life  =  7.4  days)  and  also  in  aquatic  sediments  either  in aerobic or anaerobic conditions (DT90 = 2.6 days, and 14.6 - 17.2 days, respectively). Ecotoxicity studies  were  conducted  with  various  aquatic  species  (microorganisms,  algae,  daphnids,  fishes). PEC/PNEC  ratios  calculated  for  surface  water,  groundwater,  and  sewage  treatment  plant  do  not exceed the value of 1.

Therefore, it is considered that Zypadhera does not present a significant risk to the environment.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

Olanzapine has been extensively evaluated as an oral agent and as a rapid acting IM agent. The current application  concerns  a  sustained  release  salt  form  of  olanzapine  with  pamoic  acid,  creating  an  IM injection that allows long-term exposure to olanzapine over a period of weeks. The primary evaluation of  olanzapine  pamoate  has  focused  on  the  absorption  of  the  salt  form,  as  other  aspects  of  the disposition (distribution, metabolism, excretion, etc) would be expected to remain unchanged once the compound is absorbed.

Comparison of olanzapine plasma exposure in rat and dog following administration of oral olanzapine versus intramuscular administration of OP Depot showed slower absorption of olanzapine (a single dose of OP Depot) in dogs (Tmax approximately 3 to 6 days) compared with absorption in rats and rabbits (Tmax under 24 hr). The Applicant was invited by the CHMP to comment the reasons for this interspecies variation in absorption rate. The argumentation was that this variability is likely due to multiple physiological and physical factors including differences in the placement of the injection, the size  of  the  muscle  mass  being  injected  (larger  in  dog  than  in  rat),  the  blood  flow  to  the  region  of injection,  and  the  different  species  themselves,  all  of  which  could  contribute  to  variable  absorption from the site. Regardless of this variability, the overall pharmacokinetic pattern is however predictable in  all  species,  with  absorption  to  Tmax  in  a  comparatively  short  period  of  time  (hours  or  days), followed by sustained exposure over weeks, which is expected of an IM depot administration. The CHMP accepted the reasoning of the applicant.

Pamoic acid is well absorbed in mice and rats following IM administration of pamoic acid alone or with olanzapine in the OP Depot formulation. Pamoic acid is rapidly excreted in rats via the feces. Plasma exposures and pharmacokinetic profiles of pamoic acid and radioactivity derived from 14Cpamoic acid were similar in rats, suggesting that pamoic acid is no metabolized. Thus pamoic acid, derived from the pamoate salt, is absorbed and rapidly excreted unchanged in non clinical species.

The  salient  features  of  olanzapine  oral  toxicity  were  sedation  and  systemic  toxicity  secondary  to elevated prolactin concentrations. Leukopenias were observed in all 3 nonclinical models: lymphopenia  predominantly  occurred  in  mice  and  an  idiosyncratic,  but  dose-related  incidence  of neutropenia  occurred  in  dogs.  Rats  given  16  mg/kg/day  had  decreased  lymphocyte  and  neutrophil counts  and  atrophy  of  bone  marrow  consistent  with  the  marked  reduction  in  body  weight  gain.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Notwithstanding these earlier observations for oral olanzapine in nonclinical models, olanzapine has been well tolerated in patients and hematologically related observations have been infrequent

Inflammation at the injection site was extensive in dogs treated with OP Depot. Dogs developed acute inflammatory responses, and the duration of the responses appeared to be dose related. Rats given OP Depot intramuscularly appeared to have less severe reactions than dogs.

No increases  in  fetal  toxicity  or  malformation  were  observed  in  the  embryo-fetal  studies  in  rats  or rabbits with OP Depot. Minor changes in behavioral development of offspring were observed at the highest dose employed in the perinatal/postnatal development study.

None of the nonclinical studies conducted with olanzapine pamoate monohydrate identified any new toxicity due to systemic exposure to olanzapine. The high dose used in both rat and dog studies were limited  by  the  suspension  volume  that  could  be  humanely  injected  and  the  maximum  suspendable concentration. Injection site reactions occurred in both rats and dogs precluding identification of noeffect doses; however, these laboratory animals appear to react more readily than humans studied to date. As addressed above, systemic concentrations in these studies were generally less than that seen at effect levels in the oral studies; thus, the lack of systemic toxicity is not surprising.

The compound does not constitute a genotoxic or carcinogenic risk to patients.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

Olanzapine is a well-known medicinal product, already approved for oral and immediate-release intramuscular  use.  The  applicant  has  developed  a  new  sustained-release  depot  for  IM  route  using  a practically insoluble salt (pamoate monohydrate).

The depot formulations are to be administrated once every two or four weeks and aimed to provide a consistent exposure to olanzapine comparable to that observed with the once daily oral administration of Olanzapine.

Three  strengths  are  claimed:  210-  300  and  405  mg  (equivalent  olanzapine  free  base).  When reconstituted adequately with solvent, all these strengths lead to the formation of a high solids contents aqueous suspension exhibiting the same potency (150 mg/ ml olanzapine free-base).

The phase III program of Zypadhera submitted by the Applicant is based on two main studies, HGJZ (8-week  randomized  placebo  controlled  superiority  study)  and  HGKA  24-week  randomized  active controlled  versus  oral  olanzapine  non  inferiority  study.  No  formal  dose-finding  studies  were performed and doses were selected according to pharmacokinetic data. A long-term, open label study (HGKB) having safety, effectiveness and PK as objective was ongoing at the time of the opinion.

## The initially sought indication was

Treatment of schizophrenia. ZYPADHERA is effective in the treatment of patients who have previously been exposed to oral olanzapine.

Maintenance  treatment  of  schizophrenia.  ZYPADHERA  is  effective  in  maintaining  the  clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response to oral olanzapine.

However, further to discussion with the CHMP (see Discussion on Efficacy), the applicant agreed to change the indication to

Maintenance  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  schizophrenia  sufficiently  stabilised  during  acute treatment with oral olanzapine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

Taking into account the nature of the application under consideration, the applicant has conducted PK studies in order to elucidate the PK behaviour of Zypadhera and to make comparison with the already approved and well characterised oral and RAIM (Rapid Acting Intra Muscular) routes.

The  clinical  pharmacokinetics  development  program  conducted  by  the  applicant  has  taken  into account the ethical constraints imposed by the pharmacological profile of olanzapine. Consequently only a pilot phase I study has been conducted in healthy volunteers. All PK pivotal studies have been conducted in patients.

A total  of  18  healthy  volunteers  and  412  patients  were  enrolled  in  five  formal  PK  studies,  LOBS, LOAZ, LOBE, LOBO, and LOBQ that are described in the table below.

## · Absorption

## Absolute Bioavailability :

No investigation of the absolute bioavailability of OP Depot has been conducted by the applicant.

## Characterization of the sustained release profile of OP Depot:

The OP Depot is designed to provide a sustained systemic absorption of olanzapine after IM injection. Findings from study LOBO show that a single injection of OP Depot produces a sustained olanzapine delivery into the systemic circulation. Plasma concentrations peak occurs approximately 3 days after injection and steady concentrations are maintained for more than two weeks.

Pilot  study  LOAZ  led  to  similar  results.  The  apparent  half-life  was  also  substantially  prolonged compared to the oral or fast-acting IM administration. The apparent elimination half-life was estimated to  be  approximately  232  hours  (about  10  days).  Taking  into  account  the  terminal  half-life  of olanzapine by oral route (about 30 hours), it appears clearly that the rate of absorption of OP Depot is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the limiting factor of the elimination. Thus the apparent half-life of elimination is the reflection of the apparent half-life of absorption (flip-flop phenomena).

## Relative Bioavailability: Intramuscular OP Depot versus oral and RAIM form:

No  formal  cross-over  designed  studies  have  been  conducted.  However,  Study  LOAZ  brought  few information regarding this aspect as limited number of subjects were investigated with each OP Depot dose (n= 3 for the 10 mg dose). The findings of this study showed a lower bioavailability with the OP Depot, with a 38% decrease of AUC0-∞ observed at comparable administered oral dose (10 mg). The CHMP requested the applicant to comment on the difference in the AUC measurements. The response was  that, given the  fundamental  differences in  pharmacokinetics  between  a  sustained-release administration versus an oral administration, and given that the aim of the study was to establish if these  two  dosage  forms  would  produce  a  similar  magnitude  of  drug  exposure  and  the  variability around the exposure, they did not include the relative bioavailability assessment in the analysis.  Study LOAZ was not designed or expected to provide a robust comparison of the relative bioavailability between OP Depot and oral olanzapine.  Nevertheless, the resulting pharmacokinetic data from LOAZ showed a high degree of correlation between the oral and OP Depot administrations.  The clearance values  were  nearly  identical  as  well  as  the  intersubject  variability  of  the  clearance  results,  and  the AUC values were also highly correlated between the two treatments. The CHMP considered this point resolved.

Interpretation of relative BA versus RAIM formulation was hampered by a flaw in the design of study LOBS. In the sequence of periods, the OP Depot period preceded the RAIM period with a possible carry-over effect.

## Systemic exposure to olanzapine: OP Depot versus oral route:

Study LOBE provided a picture of the systemic exposure to Olanzapine after repeated-dose of OP Depot following the claimed dosing scheme: dose range 150 up to 405 mg and administration intervals of  two  and  four  weeks.  The  plasma  sampling  was  not  optimal  to  allow  an  accurate  estimation  of relevant PK parameters AUC τ , Cmax and Cmin. However, useful information could be obtained. For instance approximate estimation of systemic exposure after repeated administration allows comparison with  the  oral  route.  Systemic  exposure  (AUC τ ,  Cmax,  Cmin)  achieved  after  IM  OP  Depot administration should be compared to that observed with the oral route at the claimed correspondent dose.  Multiple-dose  group  subjects  were  dosed  for  up  to  6  months,  and  two  dosing  intervals  were tested: two weeks and four weeks (main PK parameters are summarised in the tables below).

## Bioequivalence:

Considering  that  particles  size  of  the  active  substance  could  potentially  impact  the  release  and therefore the BA of olanzapine from the IM Depot, the applicant has conducted a study (study LOBS) designed for the investigation the impact of PSD (Particle Size Distribution) on the BA of OP Depot. Four different lots with different particles size were used in the study.

When  AUC  ratio  was  considered,  the  relative  bioavailability  observed  with  each  OP  Depot  Lot (single-dose) was quite lower (70-50 %) to that observed with the oral route (steady-state). However, these conclusions should be regarded cautiously as data from steady-state situation (oral route) was compared to data obtained after single-dose (IM Depot). Nevertheless, the comparison made by the applicant could not address the concern regarding the comparability of the BA obtained with different Lots. The  CHMP  therefore  asked  the  applicant  to  conduct  inter  batches  comparison  and  to  better present study LOBS results in order to clarify the possible impact of PSD and particles shape on the variability of BA. One problem the applicant identified was that the group of patients that was given four different lots in Study LOBS had a different proportion of patients who smoked.  After the model was  adjusted  for  this  variable  (smoking  habit),  the  four  lots  tested  in  LOBS  were  shown  to  be substantially equivalent with respect to Cmax and AUC.

## Influence of application site on the bioavailability:

No specific investigation of the influence of the site of injection on the BA of olanzapine has been conducted. Nevertheless, comparison of limited data in patients observed after deltoid injection (study LOBE) suggested that  no  substantial  impact  of  the  injection  into  the  deltoid  on  the  bioavailability characteristics of OP Depot may occur compared to the injection into the buttocks.

- Distribution

Distribution pattern of olanzapine has been extensively investigated by oral route. Thus, no specific studies  were  conducted  with  the  OP-Depot  IM  formulation.  In  plasma,  olanzapine  is  highly (approximately  93  %)  bound  to  plasma  proteins  (albumin  and  Acid-Alpha1-Glycoprotein).  Protein plasma binding is not saturable at therapeutic plasma concentrations level. No significant change in protein binding has been observed in pathologic situation such as sever renal insufficiency.

- Elimination

The metabolism pathway and excretion route of olanzapine and related metabolites has been clearly elucidated with the oral route as well as when olanzapine is administered by IM route (Fast-Acting IM solution).  For  instance,  no  new  metabolite  has  been  identified  with  the  IM  fast-acting  solution  as compared  to  the  oral  route.  The  overall  metabolism  profile  was  similar  with  both  routes  of administration.

Considering that a new salt (pamoate) of olanzapine is used in the Depot formulation, the applicant has performed two new studies with OP Depot, study LOBO and study LOBQ, in order to elucidate the  metabolite  profile  of  olanzapine  and  pamoic  acid  (the  counter  ion  of  olanzapine  in  the  new pamoate salt used in the OP Depot as compared to the oral route).

The findings of these studies regarding the metabolite profile of Olanzapine Pamoate as compared to the oral route are summarized below:

## Olanzapine:

The  primary  metabolites  of  olanzapine  (4-N-Desmethyl  olanzapine  and  glucuronide  of  olanzapine) were present at exposure levels 3-fold to 10-fold lower than unchanged olanzapine following the first and the fourth  300 mg IM dose and after repeated oral olanzapine doses. The PK characteristics of the metabolites following the fourth injection of OP Depot were consistent with the estimates following the first injection, indicating no metabolic unforeseen shift after repeated injection of OP Depot. Based on the metabolic ratios (a comparison of the AUC τ ss for each metabolite to the oral olanzapine AUC τ ), it appears that metabolism of olanzapine is not affected by the route of administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Analysis of urine samples from patients receiving oral olanzapine and OP Depot show the presence of Olanzapine, N-Desmethyl olanzapine and 4-N-Oxyde Olanzapine, 2-Hydroxy-methyl Olanzapine and the  4-N-Glucuronide  and  10-N-Glucuronide  diasteromers  of  olanzapine.  Therefore,  Olanzapinerelated metabolite profiles for urine and plasma after oral olanzapine and after OP Depot were similar.

## Pamoic acid:

Data from study LOBO showed that pamoic acid concentrations were reflecting those of olanzapine and demonstrated the sustained release of the olanzapine pamoate salt from the intramuscular site of injection. Concentrations were similar between the clinical trial material lots. In general, the sustained release  of  the  olanzapine pamoate  salt from  the intramuscular site  of  injection  yields  a later Tmax, lower  Cmax,  and  extended  half-life  for  pamoic  acid.  No  related-acid  pamoic  derivative  has  been detected in plasma and only traces of pamoic acid were detected in faeces.

The main PK measures for pamoic acid following the first 300 mg of OP Depot dose are summarised in the table below.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

## Single Dose:

Information  regarding  dose  proportionality  after  single  dose  administration  of  OP  Depot  could  be obtained from study LOAZ. The dose range of 10 to 40 mg was investigated in a small number of healthy  volunteers.  Also  some  information  regarding  higher  doses  (50  up  to  450  mg)  could  be obtained from study LOBE.

In  study  LOAZ  a  dose  proportional  increase  of  AUC0-inf was  achieved.  However,  the  CHMP considered that the estimation of AUC0-inf was not optimal and that the dose range tested was far below the dose range of clinical interest (150-405mg).

## Repeated Dose:

In study LOBE using clinically relevant OP Depot doses up to 405 mg suggested T½ to be comparable to that in study LOAZ after 100 mg injection, but increasingly higher T½ values were observed after higher doses (2-week data: 210 mg - T½ 561 hours; 300 mg - T½ 751 hours; 4-week data: 405 mg 995 hours).

Given the above results, the CHMP asked the applicant to discuss upon the non-linearity of absorption kinetics and its clinical implications. The applicant performed a new statistical analysis that confirmed that it is not possible to assert that the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine after single or multiple doses of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

OP  Depot  are  dose  proportional  and  linear  across  the  full  range  of  doses.  Nonetheless,  no  major aspects  of  nonlinearity  were  revealed  in  these  analyses.  Further,  the  applicant  argued  that  the calculated value of olanzapine clearance remains similar for both OP Depot and orally administered olanzapine.  Hence, a longer half-life should not be assumed to be associated with a greater degree of accumulation upon multiple-dose administration, but should be properly associated with a prolonged and sustained concentration profile for olanzapine associated with a rate-limited absorption process. The CHMP agreed that the dose-proportionality was not demonstrated after single and multiple-dose administration  of  the  OP-Depot,  with  no  major  deviation  being  evidenced.  No  definite  conclusions could be drawn regarding the dose-proportionality due to the high inter-subjects variability and the overlapping between doses.

## Time dependency:

Use  of the practically insoluble pamoate  salt of olanzapine may  potentially lead to higher accumulation than expected in the site of injection. Useful information regarding this aspect could be obtained from the findings of studies LOBO and LOBE as plasma concentrations profiles has been established in the same patients after a first-dose and repeated-dose.

The accumulation ratio was estimated to be approximately 2.9 (study LOBO). As at last dose (fourth dose after two months treatment), the steady-state was not reached, the accumulation ratio reported is considered  to  be  an  underestimation  of  the  actual  accumulation  coefficient  at  steady-state.  Better estimation of accumulation ratio could be obtained from data of study LOBE. However, no suitable presentation  of  the  data  allowing  the  evaluation  of  accumulation  coefficient  was  provided  by  the applicant.  Visual  analysis  of  mean  plasma  profiles  in  patients  treated  with  the  highest  doses  300 mg/2q-weeks  and  300-405  mg/q4-weeks  showed  that  steady-state  was  not  reached  after  24  weeks treatment. Therefore, higher accumulation may occur after long term use of OP Depot rising safety concern. The CHMP asked the applicant to address these concerns. The requested estimation of the accumulation ratio from LOBE study data was not provided by the applicant. No further discussion of the findings of this study with regard to the drug accumulation (such as analysis of residual plasma concentrations after long term use) was made by the applicant. However, the applicant asserted that no additional accumulation may occur with repeated injections for 24 weeks (6 months) and 100 weeks (two years). This assertion is based on the evaluation performed by the population pharmacokinetic modelling.

This assertion could not be endorsed by the CHMP. Indeed, few long-term data were available and thus included in the database used in the population pharmacokinetic analysis and the validation of the model by external data was lacking. As a consequence, the validity of the predicted systemic exposure after long term use (up to 2 years) was not assured. Therefore, no robust conclusions could be drawn from  this  analysis  with  regard  to  systemic  exposure  after  long-term  use.  This  lack  of  information should be sought from the perspective that inflammatory reactions and subsequent encapsulation may retain the particles in the tissue much longer than expected. As stated by the applicant, this aspect has not  been  investigated  specifically  in  the  clinical  studies.  Moreover,  when  preclinical  data  are considered, the relatively short-term (8 weeks) investigation in animal models (rats and beagle dogs) after single-dose administration showed some degree of an inflammatory response and encapsulation. No long-term investigations have been conducted in animals.

As a response to CHMP objections, additional data (Olanzapine plasma concentrations after long-term use) from Study HGKB obtained after the initial submission population pharmacokinetic datalock, as well  as  with  a  new  population  dataset  from  Study  LOBE  (not  available  at  the  time  of  the  initial submission) are submitted. In these additional data, Olanzapine plasma concentrations were obtained for 191 patients (228 concentrations) after 1 year of treatment, for 155 patients (182 concentrations) after 2 years and for 57 patients (59 concentrations) after 2.75 years (33 months).

Neither  of  these  datasets  was  used  in  the  original  population  pharmacokinetic  model  development which included data from Studies HGJZ, LOBS, HGKA and HGKB.  The additional long term HGKB data have been used to obtain the Bayesian estimates of the concentrations, and the LOBE data have been used for both Bayesian estimates and model parameters estimation. A good fit between the model estimated and the observed long-term exposure is obtained. The olanzapine plasma concentrations do not increase with time and thus there is no trend suggesting the potential for long-term accumulation. Furthermore, there was no new safety pattern emerging with long-term use of OP Depot.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Intra- and inter-individual variability:

The intrasubject variability was examined in several studies. In Study LOBE, more than 300 profiles for  multiple  doses  of  OP  Depot  were  examined  for  each  patient's  olanzapine  plasma-concentration profile. The results showed a high intersubject and intrasubject variability. The CHMP requested the applicant  to  discuss  the  impact  of  the  higher  variability  on  the  management  of  patients  during  the treatment  by  IM  Depot.  The  applicant  showed  that  the  large  intra  subject  variability  was  mainly  a reflection of inter-occasion variability due to variability in dissolution and absorption from the site of intramuscular injection. On the basis of the applicant's arguments, the CHMP considered this point resolved.

## · Special populations

No  formal  studies  were  conducted  in  subjects  with  renal  impairment,  hepatic  impairment,  and  in different  races  since  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  in  these  sub-groups  could  reasonably  be  inferred from that resulting from the oral route. No formal studies were conducted in children as OP Depot is not recommended in children and adolescents below 18 years.

## Gender:

A gender difference in olanzapine pharmacokinetics is attributed to differences in CYP1A2 enzyme activity. Typical plasma concentrations of olanzapine will likely be higher in females. However small difference is observed and no dosage adjustment is required.

## Elderly:

No  specific  study  has  been  conducted  in  order  to  compare  the  pharmacokinetics  of  OP  Depot  in elderly subjects comparatively to young subjects. The applicant states that the different PK behaviour in the elderly (a trend toward lower plasma clearance and a longer mean elimination half-life as shown with  oral  administration)  is  attributed  to  decreased  function  of  organ  system  responsible  for metabolism or excretion. Consequently,  the recommendation  of use of  OP  Depot in this  sub-group could  be  inferred  from  those  stated  for  oral  route.  Nevertheless,  the  CHMP  asked  the  applicant  to further elaborate on the possible dosing recommendation and on the impact of the reduction and of the biological  modifications  of  the  muscular  mass  in  the  elderly  population.  In  response,  the  applicant agreed to include the following information into the SPC section 4.2, Elderly patients

ZYPADHERA has not been systematically studied in elderly patients (&gt; 65 years). ZYPADHERA is not recommended for treatment in the elderly population unless a well-tolerated and effective dosage regimen using oral olanzapine has been established. A lower starting dose (150 mg/4 weeks) is not routinely indicated, but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4). ZYPADHERA is not recommended to be started in patients &gt;75 years.

And the following information appear in section 4.4, Use in elderly patients (&gt;75 years)

No information on the use of ZYPADHERA in patients &gt;75 years is available. Due to biochemical and physiological modification and reduction of muscular mass, this formulation is not recommended to be started in this sub-group of patients.

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

No  new in  vitro or in  vivo studies  were  provided.  Potential  for  interaction  of  olanzapine  was extensively investigated and related data were submitted in the oral file.

## Pharmacodynamics

Pharmacodynamic properties of olanzapine were previously well described.

In preclinical studies, olanzapine exhibited a range of receptor affinities (Ki; &lt; 100 nM) for serotonin 5 HT2A/2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6; dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, D5; cholinergic muscarinic receptors m1-m5; α -1  adrenergic;  and  histamine  H1  receptors.    In  a  single  oral  dose  (10  mg)  Positron  Emission tomography (PET) study in healthy volunteers, olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy. In addition, a SPECT imaging study in schizophrenic patients revealed that

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

olanzapine-responsive patients had lower striatal D2 occupancy than some other antipsychotic- and risperidone-responsive patients, while being comparable to clozapine-responsive patients.

In the only pharmacodynamic study performed with OP Depot (HGJW), it was shown that D2 receptor occupancy correlates well with the olanzapine plasma concentration reaching mean levels of receptor oocupancy  about  60  %  during  the  course  of  the  study.  This  study  is  accepted  as  a  bridging  study showing that olanzapine plasma concentrations delivered by the intra muscular administration of OP Depot can be expected to produce pharmacodynamic characteristics that can be predicted by plasma concentrations  of  olanzapine.  No  further  pharmacodynamic  studies  are  needed  to  support  this application.

## Clinical efficacy

No formal dose-finding studies were performed. For efficacy studies, doses were selected based on pharmacokinetic results. The applicant has submitted one phase Ib study (LOBE), in which secondary objectives included a determination of acceptable doses of Zypadhera for use in Phase III studies.

To support the efficacy two primary efficacy and safety studies were performed.

Study HGJZ assessed the efficacy and safety of three doses (300 mg/2 weeks, 405 mg/4 weeks, and 210  mg/2  weeks)  of  Zypadhera  in  the  acute  treatment  (8  weeks)  of  schizophrenia.  This  was  a randomized and placebo-controlled study in 404 patients with schizophrenia.

Study HGKA assessed the efficacy and safety of four doses (45 mg/4 weeks, 150 mg/2 weeks, 300 mg/2  weeks,  and  405  mg/4  weeks)  of  Zypadhera  relative  to  oral  olanzapine  (10  to  20  mg)  in  the maintenance  treatment  (24  weeks)  of  schizophrenia.  This  was  a  randomized  active  comparator controlled noninferiority study without a placebo arm in 1065 stabilised outpatients with schizophrenia.

For  Studies  HGJZ  and  HGKA,  supplementation  of  Zypadhera  with  oral  antipsychotic  medication (including oral olanzapine) was not allowed per the protocols.

In addition, to support the long-term safety and efficacy of Zypadhera, an interim analysis of Study F1D-MC-HGKB has been submitted.

## · Dose response study

F1D-EW-LOBE(d) (LOBE): to assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Single and Multiple  Doses  of  an  Intramuscular  Formulation  of  Depot  Olanzapine  (Pamoate  Salt)  in  Stable Schizophrenic  Subjects.  Secondary  objectives  of  this  phase  Ib  study  included  a  determination  of acceptable doses of Zypadhera for use in Phase 3 studies.

## METHODS

This was a multicenter, open-label study in subjects who met the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition [DSM-IV] and who were stable for the last 4 weeks with olanzapine oral treatment.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerance of a depot olanzapine formulation after single and multiple doses in subjects with stabilised schizophrenia.

## The secondary objectives were:

- -To  assess  the  pharmacokinetics  of  an  olanzapine  depot  formulation  following  single  and multiple administrations in subjects with stabilised schizophrenia.
- -To attempt to define acceptable doses for an olanzapine depot formulation for use in phase III studies.
- -To evaluate the maintenance of psychiatric control following depot injections of olanzapine; change of scores from baseline on the BPRS and the CGI-S will be monitored and summarised.

## Study periods

Study Period I was the baseline assessment period (Visit 1) for all subjects in the study.

Subjects who completed Study Period I and continued to meet the entry criteria at Visit 2 could enter Study Period II. This period was approximately 28 days.

Subjects who completed Study Period I and who continued to meet the entry criteria at Visit 2 could be entered into Study Period III. Study Period III was between 3 and 6 months in length. The dosing intervals were 14, 21, or 28 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study Participants

The main inclusion criteria were:

- -Male or female in-subjects or out-subjects at least 18 and no more than 70 years of age.
- -Subjects must have schizophrenia (disease diagnostic criteria as defined in DSM-IV)

-Subjects must have been stable for the last 4 weeks (patients must be receiving the same dose of oral olanzapine for the last 4 weeks)

- -Subjects must have tolerated oral olanzapine

-An electrocardiogram (ECG) considered within the normal limits, with a QTc interval less than 500 ms, as read from ECG printout.

## Treatments

## Period I:

The  assessment  period  lasted  4  to  21  days.  Subjects  continued  taking  their  current  oral  olanzapine therapy until the last day of the assessment period.

## Period II: Single dose

At Visit 2, the first day of Study Period II, subjects had their oral olanzapine discontinued. Subjects received only one injection ranged from 50 to 450 mg.

## Period III: Multiple dose

At Visit 2, the first day of Study Period III, subjects had their oral olanzapine discontinued.

Subjects received injections of 100 to 405 mg, every 2, 3, or 4 weeks for 3 or 6 months.

Once  this  interval  had  been  determined,  it  was  intended  that  it  remain  fixed  for  each  subject throughout Study Period III.

The dose of the subsequent injections could vary depending upon the tolerability and preliminary PK data  of  the  previous  injections  and  new  data  coming  from  the  ongoing  study,  as  well  as  from  the clinical status of the subject.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Safety assessment: vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiograms (ECGs).

Pharmacokinetic assessment: PK assessment blood samples were collected during the oral lead-in and after  administering  IM  olanzapine  depot  to  measure  plasma  olanzapine  concentrations  for  PK analyses.

## Results

## Participant flow

Three  hundred  fourteen  subjects  entered,  and  281  enrolled.  Of  these  281  enrolled  subjects,  202 subjects completed the study according to the protocol. Data from all subjects enrolled are included in the pharmacokinetic (PK) and statistical analyses.

The most common reason for discontinuation from the study was due to subject decision (22 subjects). A total of 11 unique subjects discontinued the study due to an adverse event (AE).

Thirty-four  subjects  enrolled  in  the  single  dose  study  (study  period  II),  and  30  subjects  completed according to the protocol. Two subjects discontinued due to adverse events (AEs).

Two hundred  twenty-three  subjects  enrolled  in  the  multiple-dose  study  (study  period  III),  and  153 subjects completed according to the protocol. Seven subjects discontinued due to AEs.

## Outcomes and estimation

Following single and multiple doses of IM olanzapine depot, plasma olanzapine concentrations were sustained for at least 28 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

IM olanzapine depot doses of 150 to 300 mg/2 weeks and 210 to 405 mg/4 weeks were projected to provide  average  steady-state  olanzapine  concentrations  similar  to  those  obtained  following  oral administration of 5 to 20 mg/day. Mean plasma olanzapine concentration profiles following repeated administration of IM olanzapine depot showed the steady state was achieved in 2 to 3 months. Details of  mean  olanzapine  concentrations  following  doses  of  150  mg/2  weeks  and  405  mg/4  weeks  are provided in the two figures below.

- Main study(ies)

## HGJZ, 8-week treatment study

## METHODS

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and parallel-design study conducted at 42 centers in 3 countries (United States, Croatia, and Russia).

Study periods

Figure HGJZ.9.1. Illustration of study design for Study F1D-MC-HGJZ.

<!-- image -->

Study  period  I: washout  period,  with  duration  of  2  to  7  days.  Patients  were  inpatients  and  were expected to meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria and complete all examinations prior to entering Visit 2.

Study period II : 8-week double-blind treatment, during which patients received one of four treatment injections every 2 weeks (300 mg/2 weeks, 405 mg/4 weeks, 210 mg/2 weeks, and placebo). Patients who  were  randomized  to  405  mg/4weeks  Zypadhera  received  a  placebo  injection  at  every  other injection  visit.  During  the  first  2  weeks  following  randomization,  patients  were  expected  to  be inpatients and were assessed daily.

## Study Participants

The main inclusion criteria were:

- -Male or female patients at least 18 and no more than 75 years of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Patients must have schizophrenia that meets disease diagnostic criteria as defined in DSM-IV or DSM-IV-TR.
- -Patients receiving treatment with an injectable depot antipsychotic must have received the last injection at least 2 weeks or one injection interval, whichever is longer, prior to Visit 2.
- -Patients must have a PANSS-derived BPRS score of ≥ 48 (1 to 7 scale).

## Main exclusion criteria:

Patients who were previously treated with olanzapine and were considered to be treatment resistant to olanzapine were excluded from participating in the study.

## Treatments

Doses  evaluated  in  this  study  were  300  mg/2  weeks,  405  mg/4  weeks,  and  210  mg/  2  weeks Zypadhera in comparison to placebo/2 weeks.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of the 3 doses of Zypadhera (210 mg/2 weeks, 405 mg/4 weeks, and 300 mg/2 weeks) compared with placebo in change from baseline to endpoint in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total score in the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia.

The secondary objectives were to  assess  the  efficacy,  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  the  3  doses  of Zypadhera,  to  determine  the  earliest  time  point  at  which  each  doses  of  Zypadhera  show  superior clinical improvement, and to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of olanzapine following multiple dosing with Zypadhera.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary  endpoint:  change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  in  the  Positive  and  Negative  Syndrome  Scale (PANSS) Total score (range from 30 to 210, i.e. from symptom not present to symptom extremely severe).

## Secondary endpoints:

Efficacy variables:

- -PANSS Positive (range from 7 to 49), PANSS Negative (range from 7 to 49), and PANSS General Psychopathology subscales (range from 16 to 112)
- -Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) (range from 1 to 7, i.e. from normal to extremely ill)
- -Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (24 items scale, each to be rated in a 7-point scale of severity ranging from 'not present' to 'extremely severe'
- -PANSS Total score response rate defined by a 40% or greater decrease in PANSS Total score from baseline to the last value postbaseline

## Health outcome/quality of life measures:

- -Heinrichs-Carpenter  quality  of  life  scale  (QLS):  The  QLS  total  score  is  the  sum  of  the  21 items  (rate  on  a  7-point  scale  with  scores  0  and  1  reflect  severe  impairment).  The  four  categories contained  in  the  QLS  are  Intrapsychic  Foundations  (items  13  to  17  plus  20  and  21);  Interpersonal Relations (items 1 to 8); Instrumental Role (items 9 to 12); and Common Objects and Activities (items 18 and 19).
- -Medical outcomes study 36-items short form health survey (SF-36): this scale (0-100 scale with  higher  scores  representing  better  health  status  and  functioning)  is  composed  by  36  questions covering 8 areas (physical function, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical problems, vitality, general  health  perceptions,  role  limitations  due  to  emotional  problems,  mental  health,  and  social function)

Safety assessment: Adverse events, Concomitant therapies, Laboratory data, Vital signs, Electrocardiograms  (ECGs),  Extrapyramidal  symptoms  (EPS)  measured  with  Simpson-Angus  scale (SAS)  from  0  complete  absence  of  the  Parkinsonian  symptoms  to  40  presence  in  extreme  form,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Abnormal  involuntary  movement  scale  (AIMS)  from  0  no  dyskinetic  movements  to  40  severe dyskinetic movements, and Barnes Akathisia scale (Barnes) from 0 no akathisia to 3 severe akathisia.

## Sample size

A total of approximately 400 patients had been planned to be randomized, 100 per treatment group. This sample size had approximately 90% power to detect a difference in means of 10, assuming that the common standard deviation is 21.6 using a two-group t-test with a two-sided α level of 0.05.

## Randomisation

Patient numbers were assigned at Visit 1. Randomization of patients to treatment groups was applied within each study site at Visit 2 by a computer-generated random sequence using the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio into the three Zypadhera groups, and one placebo group.

## Blinding (masking)

Study Period I (2-7 days from visit 1 to visit 2) was an open-label washout period. Study Period II (8 weeks from visit 2 to visit 22) was the double-blind treatment period.

## Statistical methods

An intent-to-treat (ITT) principle was applied in the efficacy, safety, and health outcomes analyses. Efficacy analyses included all randomized patients (N=404) with baseline and postbaseline observations. Efficacy data were analyzed using the last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) method.

Continuous data were analyzed using ANOVA models; the models generally included the terms for treatment and investigator study site. For analysis of proportions, Fisher's exact test was used.

Subgroup analyses were conducted using ANOVA models. All tests of hypotheses were tested at a twosided α level of 0.05. In order to assess longitudinal effects, a likelihood-based repeated measures analysis was conducted on the postbaseline PANSS Total score and associated subscales.

## RESULTS

## Participant flow

A total of 404 patients began double-blind treatment, and of these, 267 (66.1%) patients completed. The most common reasons for discontinuing the study during this period were lack of efficacy (n=59) and  patient  decision  (n=45).  There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  (p=0.167)  across treatment groups for overall reasons for discontinuation.

For the details of the participants flow, see the chart below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

Statistically  significant  differences  in time  to  discontinuation  for  lack  of  efficacy  (overall,  p=.0154; Zypadhera  310  mg/2  weeks  versus  placebo,  p=.0446;  Zypadhera  405  mg/4  weeks  versus  placebo, p=.0082;  Zypadhera  210  mg/2  weeks  versus  placebo,  p=.0161)  were  seen.  Differences  in  time  to discontinuation for any reason and differences in time to discontinuation for AEs were not statistically significant.

The rates of discontinuation were 33% in OPD 300mg/2w group, 28% in OPD 405mg/4w group, 32% in OPD 210 mg/2w group, and 43% in placebo group.

405o4W =405mg/4weeks olanzapine Pamoate Depot,PLA =Placebo,n=All randomized patients Type 3 sum of squares was used in the following ANovA model: Full model: (Therapy) + (Inv) Program LoCation:RMP.FIDSHGJZ.SASPGM(LOPANA1) OutputLocation:RHP.F1DO.HGJZ(LOPANAl1)

At baseline, the PANSS Total scores in all groups were approximately 100 points, corresponding to patients very symptomatic.

The differences in PANSS Total scale between baseline and endpoint in the three treatment groups (300Q2W,  405Q4W,  and  210  Q2W)  were  respectively  -26.32,  -22.57,  and  -22.49  versus  -8.51  in placebo group. A mean decrease of 23.8 shows a clinically relevant and important improvement.

The  differences  were  statistically  significant  from  week  0.43  in  300Q2W  and  405Q4W  treatment groups (respectively -8.64, and -8.22) and from week 1 in 210Q2W treatment group (-13.68).

## Analysis of the PANSS Total score response rate

Response was defined as an improvement ≥ 40% of the PANSS Total score at endpoint.

The  overall  difference  in  response  rate  across  the  four  treatment  groups  (300Q2W,  405Q4W, 210Q2W, and placebo) was not statistically significant different (respectively 25.5%, 20.0, 17.9, and 11.2; p=.075).

In  a  post  hoc  analysis  using  the  decrease  of  20%  or  greater  of  the  PANSS  Total  score  as  new definition  of  response,  all  3  Zypadhera  dosages  again  had  higher  rates  of  response  compared  to placebo (60.2%, 56.0%, and 58.5% respectively, compared to 28.6%), and in this analysis the rates were statistically significantly different (p&lt;0.001).

## Analyses of secondary variables

The  differences  of  score  in  CGI-I,  CGI-S,  PANSS  Positive,  PANSS  Negative,  PANSS  General Psychopathology score, and BPRS were all statistically significant in favour the 3 treatment groups versus placebo.

## Health outcomes/quality of life evaluation

Across  subscale  score  mean  change,  there  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between Zypadhera and placebo in the analysis of Common Objects and Activities or Instrumental Role.

There  were  statistically  significant  differences  between  Zypadhera  and  placebo  in  the  analysis  of Intrapsychic Foundation and Interpersonal Relations.

## SF-36:

All  three  Zypadhera  treatment  groups  demonstrated  statistically  significant  improvement  over  the placebo group in the Summary Score-Mental (all three p-values &lt;0.05). There were no statistically significant differences across the treatment groups in the Summary Score- Physical.

## HGKA, maintenance treatment study

## METHODS

This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel, 24-week outpatient study comparing the efficacy and safety of Zypadhera (150 mg/2 weeks, 405 mg/4 weeks, and 300 mg/2 weeks) with oral olanzapine (10,  15,  and  20  mg/day)  and  with  low  dose  Zypadhera  (45  mg/4  weeks).  Patients  were  clinically stabilized  with  schizophrenia  for  a  minimum  of  4  weeks.  This  study  was  conducted  at  112  study centers in 26 countries (United States, South America, Europe, Turkey, Israel, Taiwan, Australia and Russian Federation).

## Study period I:

Study Period I was the lead-in period and consisted of a minimum of 2 days and a maximum of 9 days.

Patients  must  continue  current  oral  antipsychotic  medication  (other  than  clozapine)  during  Study Period I.

Patients receiving treatment with an injectable antipsychotic must have received the last injection at least 2 weeks or one injection interval, whichever is longer, prior to Visit 2. Patients taking risperidone long-acting injections must have received their last injection at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 2.

To enter Study Period II, patients must demonstrate clinical stability by the following:

- -Outpatient status (long-term residential and chronic care facilities are acceptable)
- -A Clinical  Global  Impression-Improvement  of  Illness  (CGI-I)  score  of  1,  2,  3,  or  4  (when compared with Visit 1 Clinical Global Impression- Severity of Illness [CGI-S] score)
- -Brief  Psychiatric  Rating  Scale  (BPRS)  Positive  score ≤ 4  (1  to  7  scale)  on  each  of  the following  items:  conceptual  disorganization,  suspiciousness,  hallucinatory  behaviour,  and  unusual thought content.

## Study period II:

Study Period II is the conversion and stabilization period of the study, during which patients must be discontinued from their current antipsychotic medication and converted to oral olanzapine monotherapy at 10, 15, or 20 mg/day.

Patients  who  are  receiving  oral  olanzapine  monotherapy  upon  entry  into  the  study  must  remain  in Study Period II for a minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum of 8 weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients who are receiving an antipsychotic other than, or in addition to, oral olanzapine upon entry to the study must remain in Study Period II for a minimum of 6 weeks (Visit 8) and a maximum of 8 weeks (Visit 10). This study period will be used as follows:

- -2  to  4  weeks  for  conversion  from  current  antipsychotic  medication  to  oral  olanzapine monotherapy at the discretion of the investigator
- -4 consecutive weeks to meet stabilization criteria as outlined above.

To  enter  Study  Period  III,  patients  must  demonstrate  stability  for  4  weeks  (5  consecutive  visits), during Study Period II, by meeting the following stabilization criteria:

- -No dose change of oral olanzapine monotherapy (fixed at 10, 15, or 20mg/day)
- -CGI-I score equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4 (when compared with Visit 1 CGI-S score)
- -BPRS  Positive  score ≤ 4  (1  to  7  scale)  on  each  of  the  following  items:  conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behaviour, and unusual thought content.

## Study Period III:

Study  Period  III  is  the  maintenance  period  consisting  of  24  weeks  of  double-blind  maintenance therapy.

## Study Period IV:

Study Period IV is the open-label restabilization period for those patients who are discontinued from double-blind therapy in  Study Period III due to exacerbation of symptoms  associated with schizophrenia.

## Study Participants

The main inclusion criteria were:

- -Male or female patients at least 18 and no more than 75 years of age.
- -Patients must have schizophrenia that meets disease diagnostic criteria as defined in DSM-IV or DSM-IV-TR at the time of study entry.

-Patients receiving treatment with an injectable depot antipsychotic must have received the last injection at least 2 weeks or one injection interval, whichever is longer, prior to Visit 2.

-Stability is present at Visit 1 defined as outpatient status for at least 4 weeks preceding Visit 1, and with BPRS Positive items ≤ 4  (1  to  7  scale).  Positive  items  include conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behaviour, and unusual thought content.

Patients  must  not  have  been  previously  treated  with  olanzapine  and  considered  to  be  treatmentresistant to olanzapine.

## Treatments

Doses evaluated in this study were 405 mg/4 weeks, 300 mg/2 weeks, 150 mg/2 weeks, and 45 mg/4 weeks Zypadhera, or oral olanzapine 10 mg/day, 15 mg/day, or 20 mg/day.

Patients randomized to oral olanzapine received the same olanzapine dose that they were stabilized on during Study Period II.

The 45 mg/4 weeks Zypadhera arm (low dose close to placebo) ensured assay sensitivity. This is in line with Appendix to Note for Guidance (CPMP/EWP/49/01, 2003).

## Objectives

The first primary objective was to  demonstrate noninferior efficacy of Pooled 2-Week Zypadhera (300 mg/2 weeks pooled with 150 mg/2 weeks) as compared with 10, 15, and 20 mg oral olanzapine in terms of exacerbation rates after 24 weeks of maintenance treatment.

The second primary objective was to  demonstrate superior efficacy of 300 mg/2 weeks, 405 mg/4 weeks,  and  150  mg/2  weeks  as  compared  to  45  mg/4  weeks  in  terms  of  time  to  exacerbation  of symptoms of schizophrenia.

## The main secondary objectives were :

- -To  demonstrate  noninferior  efficacy  in  terms  of  exacerbation  rates  of  Pooled  2-Week Zypadhera (300 mg/2 weeks pooled with 150 mg/2 weeks) compared with 405 mg/4 weeks

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -To provide information on transition of patients stabilized on oral olanzapine at 10, 15, or 20 mg/day to therapeutic doses of Zypadhera
- -To  demonstrate  superiority  of  300  mg/2  weeks,  150  mg/2  weeks,  and  405  mg/4  weeks Zypadhera compared with 45 mg/4 weeks Zypadhera in change from baseline to endpoint in Positive  and  Negative  Syndrome  Scale  (PANSS)  Total  score,  PANSS  Positive,  PANSS Negative, and PANSS General subscales
- -To assess safety

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoint: Time to exacerbation of symptoms along with the estimated 24 week exacerbation rate.

Exacerbation of symptoms of schizophrenia was defined in this study as follows:

1. An  increase  on  any  of  the  BPRS  Positive  items  (conceptual  disorganization,  hallucinatory behaviour, suspiciousness, unusual thought content) to a score &gt; 4 and an absolute increase of ≥ 2 on that specific item since randomization at Visit 10, or
2. An  increase  of  any  of  the  BPRS  Positive  items  (conceptual  disorganization,  hallucinatory behaviour, suspiciousness, unusual thought content) to a score &gt; 4 and an absolute increase of ≥ 4 on the BPRS Positive subscale (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behaviour, suspiciousness, unusual thought content) since randomization at Visit 10, or
3. Hospitalization due to worsening of positive psychotic symptoms.

## Secondary endpoints:

Efficacy variables: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and CGI-Improvement (CGI-I).

Health outcome/quality of life measures: Heinrichs-Carpenter quality of life scale (QLS) and Medical outcomes study 36-items short form health survey (SF-36).

Safety assessment: adverse events, concomitant therapies, laboratory data, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), extrapyramidal symptoms (Simpson-Angus scale (SAS) from 0 complete absence  of  the  Parkinsonian  symptoms  to  40  presence  in  extreme  form;  Abnormal  involuntary movement scale (AIMS) from 0 no dyskinetic movements to 40 severe dyskinetic movements; Barnes Akathisia scale (Barnes) from 0 no akathisia to 3 severe akathisia).

## Sample size

The  total  number  of  randomized  patients  was  expected  to  be  approximately  1050  patients  at  a 2:1:1:1:2 ratio in 5 treatment groups: 405 mg/4 weeks, 300 mg/2 weeks, 150 mg/2 weeks, 45 mg/4 weeks, or oral olanzapine.

The sample size of 300 patients in the Pooled 2-Week Zypadhera (300 mg/2 weeks pooled with 150 mg/2 weeks) and 300 patients in the oral olanzapine treatment groups ensured with 90% probability that  the  2  groups  would  be  declared  noninferior  under  the  assumptions  that:  1)  the  true  6-month exacerbation rate of oral olanzapine is 0.15 and the true 6-month exacerbation rate of Pooled 2-Week Zypadhera was no worse than 0.20; and 2) the discontinuation rate for reasons other than exacerbation is &lt;0.35 for both treatment groups up through 24 weeks on study drug.

For the superiority analyses, the sample size of 150 patients in individual Zypadhera treatment groups had approximately 90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.45 between 2 groups, assuming that the discontinuation  rate  for  reasons  other  than  exacerbation  was  &lt;0.35  for  both  treatment  groups  up through 24 weeks on study drug.

## Randomisation

Randomization  was  performed  at a 2:1:1:1:2 ratio into 5 treatment groups:  405mg/4weeks, 300mg/2weeks, 150mg/2weeks, 45mg/4weeks, or oral olanzapine.

Patient identification numbers were assigned at Visit 1. Randomization to treatment group was applied within each study site, stratified by oral olanzapine dose at the time of stabilization (10 mg or 15/20

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mg/day). Assignment to treatment group at Visit 10 was determined by a computer-generated random sequence using an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS).

## Blinding (masking)

Study Periods I and II were not blinded. Study Period III was the randomized, double-blind portion of the study.

## Statistical methods

All  analyses  were  conducted  on  an  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  basis.  Efficacy  analyses  included  all randomized patients (N=1065) with baseline and postbaseline observations unless otherwise stated.

Non-inferiority  analyses  were  based  on  Kaplan-Meier  estimated  24-week  (168  days)  cumulative exacerbation rates.

Exacerbation was defined as a BPRS Positive item score &gt; 4 (1-7 scale) either with an increase of ≥ 2 points  since  randomization  or  with  a  BPRS  Positive  subscale  increase  of ≥ 4 points since randomization, or as hospitalization due to worsening of positive symptoms.

Non-inferiority  was  assessed  using  the  upper  limit  of  a  two-sided  95%  confidence  limit  for  the difference between estimated exacerbation rates, with non-inferiority declared if the absolute value of the upper limit was &lt; 0.20.

The  delta  of  0.20  was  based  on  results  of  Study  F1D-MC-HGGI  (Olanzapine  Relapse  Prevention Versus  Placebo  in  the  Treatment  of  Schizophrenia)  and  also  on  comments  received  from  the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) during scientific advice.

The  CPMP  suggested  that  the  true  placebo  versus  oral  olanzapine  difference  in  exacerbation  rates should be conservatively estimated by the lower limit of an 80% confidence limit on the difference observed in Study HGGI. In this study, the Kaplan-Meier estimated exacerbation rate at Day 182 for placebo was 0.552 and for oral olanzapine was 0.055.

The  associated  standard  errors  for  these  estimated  exacerbation  rates  were  0.106  and  0.019, respectively,  for  placebo  and  oral  olanzapine.  Assuming  that  the  difference  between  estimated exacerbation  rates  is  approximately  normally  distributed,  this  leads  to  a  one-sided  80%  lower confidence limit of 0.406 for the difference in exacerbation rates at Day 182.

For time-to analyses, Kaplan-Meier curves were compared using a log-rank test.

Baseline  to  endpoint  analyses  used  last-observation-carried-forward  (LOCF)  methodology  unless otherwise specified.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) models were used to evaluate continuous data and generally included terms for treatment and investigator or geographic region.

The  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  on  the  LOCF  mean  change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  in PANSS Total score included baseline PANSS Total score as a continuous covariate as well as terms for treatment and investigator.

Type III sums of squares were used to test for significant effects for all ANOVA/ANCOVA models. For analysis of proportions, the Fisher's exact test was used unless otherwise specified. All hypotheses were tested at a two-sided α level of 0.05.

## RESULTS

## Participant flow

Of  the  1205  patients  entering  the  Conversion/Stabilization  Phase,  1065  eligible  patients  were randomized  in  a  2:1:1:1:2  ratio  to  receive  double-blind  Zypadhera  (405  mg/4  weeks  [n=318],  300 mg/2 weeks [n=141], 150 mg/2 weeks [n=140], 45 mg/4 weeks [n=144]) or oral olanzapine (n=322), respectively, during the Double-Blind Maintenance Phase (Study Period III). A total 753 of the 1065 eligible patients (70.7%) completed Study HGKA.

During  the  Conversion/Stabilization  Phase,  the  most  common  reason  for  discontinuing  was  patient decision (n=53).

## Discontinuation for clinical relapse during double-blind maintenance phase

The rates of discontinuation were 30 % in OPD405 group (p=.003, versus oral olanzapine), 24 % in OPD300 group, 36% in OPD150 group (p&lt;0.001, versus oral olanzapine), 47% in OPD45 group and 20% in oral olanzapine group.

According to the Rate of patients who discontinued study for clinical relapse, oral olanzapine (7.1%) treatment shows statistical difference with OPD150 group (15.7%) and OPD405 group (12.3%); and OPD300 group (5.0%) shows statistical difference with OPD150 group (15.7%) and with OPD405 group (12.3%).

Approximately 45% of patients were stabilized on an oral olanzapine dose of 10 mg/day, 22% on a dose of 15 mg/day, and 33% on a dose of 20 mg/day. For patients subsequently randomized to the double-blind maintenance phase, the mean duration of treatment in the conversion/stabilization phase was approximately 4 weeks. It should be noted that 23.3% of these patients in period I entered the study period II already on oral olanzapine therapy.

## Study period III

The patient population was predominantly male (65.4%) and Caucasian (71.8%), and included patients aged 18 to 71 years with a mean age of 38.96 years at baseline of the double-blind maintenance phase (study period III) and a mean BMI of 26.89 (14.33-56.49).

There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  across  treatment  groups  with  respect  to  baseline physical characteristics.

No statistically significant differences were observed between the Pooled 2-Week Zypadhera and the oral olanzapine treatment groups with respect to baseline physical characteristics.

The  mean  PANSS  Total  score  for  all  randomized  patients  was  55.87.  Statistically  significant differences across treatment groups were observed for the PANSS Total (p=.048), PANSS Negative Total  (p=.027),  and  BPRS  Negative  (p=.014).  On  each  of  these  measures,  the  45  mg/4  weeks Zypadhera group had the highest mean scores, while the 150 mg/2 weeks group had the lowest mean scores. Baseline CGI-S of Illness scores for all randomized patients were also statistically significantly different across treatment groups (p=.016), again with the 45 mg/4 weeks group having the highest mean score, but with the 300 mg/2 weeks group having the lowest mean score.

These baseline differences between groups were within a range of 3.42 points on the PANSS Total, 1.06 points on the PANSS Negative, 0.62 on the BPRS Negative, and 0.19 on the CGI-S and were therefore not considered clinically meaningful by the applicant.

## Numbers analysed

A total of 1065 patients met stabilization criteria and were randomized in a 2:1:1:1:2 ratio to receive Zypadhera  at  fixes  doses  of  405  mg/4  weeks  (n=318),  300  mg/2  weeks  (n=141),  150  mg/2  weeks (n=140), 45 mg/4 weeks (n=144) or to remain on their stabilization dose of oral olanzapine (n=322) for up to 24 weeks of double-blind maintenance therapy.

All  analyses  were  conducted  on  an  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  basis.  Efficacy  analyses  included  all randomized patients (N=1065) with baseline and postbaseline observations unless otherwise stated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Superiority analyses: comparisons of time to exacerbation of symptoms for each of the higher Zypadhera doses (300 mg/2 weeks, 405 mg/4 weeks, and 150 mg/2 weeks) versus the low Zypadhera dose (45 mg/4 weeks).

<!-- image -->

Non-inferiority  between  the  pooled  2-  week  Zypadhera  group  and  the  oral  olanzapine  group  was observed on the exacerbation rates (respectively, 90, and 93%, 95% CI [-0.02, 0.08]).

Analysis of time to exacerbation (p=0.167) (Table HGKA.11.24 and Figure. HGKA.11.1.) shows noninferiority between the pooled 2- week Zypadhera group and the oral olanzapine group.

The analysis of the time to exacerbation shows superiority of the OPD405, OPD300 and OPD150 on the OPD45 group (Figure HGKA.11.2.).

Thus, the two primary objectives of the maintenance study were reached.

## Secondary efficacy results

Analysis  of  exacerbation  rates  shows  non-inferiority  between  the  pooled  2-  week  Zypadhera  and OPD405, and between OPD405 and oral olanzapine group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  oral  olanzapine  treatment  group  was  statistically  significantly  superior  to  the  Pooled  2-Week Zypadhera treatment group on the mean change of the PANSS Total scores (p=0.019) after 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, the mean PANSS Total score was 55.82 (+ 0.24) on the Pooled 2-Week Zypadhera treatment group and 53.57 (-2.52) on the oral olanzapine. This difference could be considered as nonclinically significant as a score of 55.82 after 24 weeks confirms maintenance of treatment.

Considering the mean change of the PANSS Total scores for each group of treatment, OPD300 (-2.19) and oral olanzapine (-2.52) treatment groups are superior to Zypadhera 150mg (+2.66) (respectively, p=0.014  and  p  &lt;  0.001)  and  oral  olanzapine  treatment  group  is  superior  to  Zypadhera  405  (-0.09) (p=0.008).

- Ancillary analyses

## Analyses of Relative Risk of Exacerbation

The risk of exacerbation of symptoms for patients stabilized at 10 mg oral olanzapine is 2.08 times higher  for  patients  in  Zypadhera  150mg/2weeks  group,  and  seems  maintained  for  patients  in Zypadhera  405mg/4weeks  group  (HR=1.03).  The  risk  of  exacerbation  of  symptoms  for  patients stabilized at 15 or 20 mg oral olanzapine seems maintained for patients in Zypadhera 300mg/2weeks group (HR=1.01).

## Analyses of Switch from Oral Olanzapine Treatment to Zypadhera Treatment

A statistically  significant  difference  was  observed  in  the  log-rank  test  comparison  across  treatment groups (p-value=0.017). For patients stabilized on 10 mg/day oral olanzapine, approximately 98% of those  randomized  to  the  300  mg/2  weeks  Zypadhera  treatment  group  completed  the  double-blind maintenance phase without experiencing an exacerbation event, compared to 93% of patients in the 405 mg/4 weeks Zypadhera and oral olanzapine treatment groups, 86% of patients in the 150 mg/2 weeks Zypadhera treatment group, and 82% of patients in the 45 mg/4 weeks Zypadhera treatment group.

Data from patients stabilized on 10 mg/day oral olanzapine during the conversion/ stabilization phase suggest that switching patients from 10 mg/day oral olanzapine to 300 mg/2 weeks, 405 mg/4 weeks, or  150  mg/2  weeks  Zypadhera  has  no  statistically  significant  effect  with  respect  to  relative  risk  of exacerbation compared to remaining on oral olanzapine.

For patients stabilized on 15 or 20 mg/day oral olanzapine during the conversion/stabilization phase, the  relative  risk  of  exacerbation  was  2.5  times  higher  in  the  150  mg/2  weeks  Zypadhera  treatment group  versus  the  oral  olanzapine  treatment  group,  suggesting  that  patients  stabilized  on  15  or  20 mg/day  oral  olanzapine  should  be  switched  to  an  Zypadhera  dose  higher  than  150  mg/2  weeks. However, switching patients from 15 or 20 mg/day oral olanzapine to 300 mg/2 weeks or 405 mg/4 weeks Zypadhera showed no statistically significant effect with respect to relative risk of exacerbation compared to remaining on oral olanzapine.

The plasma concentration of the depot-preparation is build up rather slowly i.e. steady state is only reached  after  several  months  with  the  risk  of  under-dosing  and  as  a  consequence  early  treatment failure.  The  rate  of  discontinuation  was  20%  in  the  oral  olanzapine  arm,  24  %  in  the  Zypadhera 300mg/2weeks  group,  30  %  in  the  Zypadhera  405mg/4weeks  group,  36%  in  the  Zypadhera 150mg/2weeks group and 47% in the Zypadhera 45mg/2weeks arm.

In the higher Zypadhera group most exacerbations occurred early, during the first 50 days, suggesting that  even  the  highest  dose  405  mg/4weeks  injection  may  not  be  as  effective  as  oral  olanzapine  in maintaining good response.

The hazard ratios for exacerbations depot versus oral olanzapine were in favour of the oral comparator (except for the Zypadhera 300mg/weeks where responses are inconsistent).

On the basis of the above concerns, the CHMP asked the applicant to discuss upon the increased risk of exacerbation with Zypadhera 150mg/2weeks and on the proposed dose correspondence scheme for the switch from oral olanzapine to Zypadhera.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  applicant  argued  that  the  study  design  of  HGKA  favoured  the  oral  olanzapine  group  because subjects  who  were  stabilised,  and  therefore  responding,  on  a  certain  oral  dose  where  randomly switched to an Zypadhera dose that could be less or greater than the preceding oral dose. As requested by the CHMP, analyses examining hazard ratios indicating relative risk of exacerbation in comparison to oral olanzapine and to 45 mg/4 weeks Zypadhera at 2 months time were also conducted.

The analyses indicated that patients were at greater risk of exacerbation during the first 2 months of treatment with Zypadhera. The initial period of switching to a depot is therefore an important juncture in treatment that inherently carries a greater risk of exacerbation than does any subsequent period of treatment. For this reason, the applicant suggested that for patients whose target oral olanzapine dose would  be  10  or  15  mg/day,  clinicians  should  initiate  Zypadhera  treatment  at  a  dose  higher  than 150mg/2 weeks As a consequence, an appropriate dosing scheme is included in section 4.2 of the SPC. The CHMP accepted as valid the argumentation of the applicant.

F1D-MC-HGKA SPIV: A Double- Blind Randomized Study Comparing Intramuscular Olanzapine Depot  to  Oral  Olanzapine  and  Low-Dose  Intramuscular  Olanzapine  Depot  in  the  Maintenance Therapy of Patients with Schizophrenia: Study Period IV

A total of 133 patients with schizophrenia who were discontinued from double-blind therapy in Study Period  III  due  to  exacerbation  of  symptoms  were  entered  into  the  24-week  restabilization  period (Study Period IV). Patients were predominantly male (66.2%) and Caucasian (74.4%), with a mean age  of  40  years.  Mean  body  mass  index  (BMI)  was  26.95,  and  mean  weight  was  76.88  kg. Concomitant medication was used by 95 (71.4%) patients, with the most common medications being lorazepam (n=27, [20.3%]), clonazepam (n=23 [17.3%]), and biperiden (n=14 [10.5%]).

The  modal  dose  of  open-label  oral  olanzapine  for  the  restabilization  period  for  most  patients  (89 [66.9%])  was  20  mg/day.  The  most  common  reasons  for  discontinuation  for  the  80  patients  who discontinued  Study  Period  IV  were  physician  decision  (n=30  [22.6%)])  and  lack  of  efficacy  (n=20 [15.0%]). A total of 53 (39.8%) patients completed Study Period IV, with completion defined as 24 weeks of treatment  or restabilization,  whichever  came  first.  The  mean  time  patients  participated  in Study Period IV was 116 days.

Improvement was seen in mean CGI-I scores over the course of the study period, decreasing from a mean of 4.81 (n=128) at Visit 301 to a mean of 3.53 at Visit 312 (n=57), indicating mild improvement on average. For CGI-S scores, statistically significant improvements from baseline were observed at each visit (Visit 301, p=.037; all other visits, p&lt;.001).

## Figure HGKB.5.1. Illustration of study design for Protocol F1D-Mc-HGKB.

A total of 133 patients with schizophrenia who were discontinued from double-blind therapy in Study Period  III  due  to  exacerbation  of  symptoms  were  entered  into  the  24-week  restabilization  period (Study Period IV). Patients were predominantly male (66.2%) and Caucasian (74.4%), with a mean age  of  40  years.  Mean  body  mass  index  (BMI)  was  26.95,  and  mean  weight  was  76.88  kg. Concomitant medication was used by 95 (71.4%) patients, with the most common medications being lorazepam (n=27, [20.3%]), clonazepam (n=23 [17.3%]), and biperiden (n=14 [10.5%]). The modal dose of open-label oral olanzapine for the restabilization period for most patients (89 [66.9%]) was 20 mg/day. The most common reasons for discontinuation for the 80 patients who discontinued Study Period IV were physician decision (n=30 [22.6%)]) and lack of efficacy (n=20 [15.0%]). A total of 53 (39.8%) patients completed Study Period IV, with completion defined as 24 weeks of treatment or restabilization, whichever came first. The mean time patients participated in Study Period IV was 116 days.

Improvement was seen in mean CGI-I scores over the course of the study period, decreasing from a mean of 4.81 (n=128) at Visit 301 to a mean of 3.53 at Visit 312 (n=57), indicating mild improvement on average. For CGI-S scores, statistically significant improvements from baseline were observed at each visit (Visit 301, p=.037; all other visits, p&lt;.001).

Treatment  emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  were  reported  in  42  (31.6%)  patients.  The  most frequently reported TEAEs were depression (n=5 [3.8%]), hypertension (n=4 [3.0%]), acute psychosis (n=3 [2.3%]), headache (n=3 [2.3%]), psychotic disorder (n=3 [2.3%]), and thinking abnormal (n=3 [2.3%]). Nine (6.8%) patients discontinued Study Period IV because of AEs. No deaths were reported during this study period. Thirty-two patients (24.1%) experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) in Study  Period  IV.  The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  were  psychotic  disorder  (n=9  [6.8%]), schizophrenia (n=8 [6.0%]), acute psychosis (n=4 [3.0%]), delusion (n=2 [1.5%]), hallucination (n=2 [1.5%]), and suicidal ideation (n=2 [1.5%]).

During Study Period IV, potentially clinically significant (PCS) weight gain, defined as an increase of ≥ 7% over baseline weight, was observed in 6.6% of patients; a statistically significant mean increase

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2.6  kg)  from  baseline  to  LOCF  endpoint  was  observed  for  weight  (p=.002).  Treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory values at any time observed in &gt;10% of patients were low mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC [14.7%]), high LDL cholesterol (33.3%), and high prolactin (28.6%). Medical conditions or adverse events in Study Period IV resulted in hospitalization of 18% of patients, with a mean  of  2.4  days  spent  in  hospital.  Primary  study  conditions  or  psychiatric  conditions  resulted  in hospitalization of 47% of patients, with a mean of 1.1 days spent in hospital. Overall, oral olanzapine at a daily dose of 10, 15, or 20 mg for up to 24 weeks was well tolerated by patients who experienced exacerbation  of  their  schizophrenia  symptoms  during  Study  Period  III.  Overall  improvement  from baseline in both mean CGI-I and mean CGI-S scores was observed throughout the study period.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

Characterisation of the pharmacokinetic profile of Zypadhera represented one of the main issues of this application.

Zypadhera showed a lower bioavailability with respect to the oral route, whereas one would expect to have lower bioavailability with the oral administration due to first-pass effect. The applicant argued that interpretation of those data should take into account that study LOAZ was not designed to provide a  robust  comparison  between  the  bioavailability  of  oral  olanzapine  and  Zypadhera.  Nevertheless,  a high degree of correlation between the two formulations was detected. Comparison with the RAIM form was hindered because of a shortcoming in the design of study LOBS. In fact, in the sequence of periods, the OP Depot period preceded the RAIM period with a possible carry-over effect.

Another  concern  of  the  CHMP  was  the  non  linearity  of  the  absorption  kinetics  and  its  clinical implications.  In  fact,  repeated  administration  of  clinically  relevant  Zypadhera  doses  resulted  in increasingly higher T1/2 values. The applicant argued that the calculated clearance remained similar for both  oral  olanzapine  and  Zypadhera,  thus  the  prolonged  half  lives  should  not  be  assumed  to  be associated  with  a  greater  degree  of  accumulation  upon  multiple-dose  administration,  but  should  be properly  associated  with  a  prolonged  and  sustained  concentration  profile  for  olanzapine  associated with a rate-limited absorption process.

The CHMP concluded that despite the claim of the applicant that the increase of observed T1/2 is not in relation with a decrease in the clearance of olanzapine, a local accumulation in the site of injection could not be excluded. Also the findings of the population PK analysis as initially presented by the applicant couldn't lead to a robust conclusion with regard to the systemic exposure after long-term use. At the end of the procedure, the applicant submitted new PK long-term data from the ongoing study HGKB. Olanzapine plasma concentrations were obtained for 191 patients (228 concentrations) after 1 year of treatment, for 155 patients (182 concentrations) after 2 years and for 57 patients (59 concentrations) after 2.75 years (33 months). The olanzapine plasma concentrations do not increase with  time  and  there  is  no  trend  suggesting  the  potential  for  long-term  accumulation  reflected. Furthermore, there was no new safety pattern emerging with time. The CHMP concluded that concern on accumulation risk was solved.

No  specific  study  has  been  conducted  in  order  to  compare  the  pharmacokinetics  of  Zypadhera  in elderly subjects comparatively to young subjects. However, the CHMP asked the applicant to further elaborate  on  the  possible  dosing  recommendation  and  on  the  impact  of  the  reduction  and  of  the biological  modifications  of  the  muscular  mass  in  the  elderly  population.  In  response,  the  applicant agreed to include specific recommendation for the dosing regimen in elderly patients into section 4.2 of the SPC.

Two primary efficacy and safety studies were performed.

In study HGJZ (8-week randomized placebo controlled superiority study ), three doses were evaluated, 300  mg/2weeks,  405  mg/4weeks  and  210  mg/2weeks,  whereas  the  150  mg/2weeks  dose  was  not assessed although it was included in the dosing scheme as initiation treatment corresponding to 10mg oral olanzapine. Further to a request of the CHMP to discuss the initiation treatment schedule in view of  the  missing  data,  the  applicant  agreed  to  remove  the  150  mg/2  weeks  dose  from  the  initiation schedule.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At the end of the study LOCF analysis showed that all treatments (including placebo) had resulted a statistically significant decrease in PANSS total score from baseline. Mean decreases in PANSS total scores compared to placebo arm were as follows:

Zypadhera 300 mg/2 weeks: 17.81 points (p&lt;0.001)

Zypadhera 405 mg/4 weeks: 14.06 points (p&lt;0.001)

Zypadhera 210 mg/2 weeks: 13.98 points (p&lt;0.001)

All Zypadhera treatments were superior to placebo from week 1 visit on and continued to be more effective through-out the study period. None of the Zypadhera treatments were superior to any one of two  other  Zypadhera  treatments.    In  Zypadhera  arms,  mean  total  PANSS  score  reduction  (LOCF) ranged from 22.3% (405 mg/4 weeks) to 25.7% (300 mg/2 weeks).

After 1 week (Visit 9) of double-blind treatment, patients randomized to the three Zypadhera doses had sustained lower PANSS Total scores than patients randomized to placebo and LS mean change remained  significantly  superior  for  all  three  Zypadhera  groups  compared  with  placebo  through  the completion of the study. At Visit 22 (week 8), Zypadhera 300 mg/2 weeks was superior to Zypadhera 405 mg/4 weeks and 210 mg/2 weeks.

The overall difference in response rate in the study period II across the four treatment groups was not significantly different (p=.075).

All three Zypadhera treatment groups showed statistically significant improvement demonstrated on the CGI-I score compared with placebo at Visit 5 (day 3) and throughout the rest of Study Period II. All  three  Zypadhera  treatment  groups  were  statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo  in  OC visitwise  comparisons  of  the  CGI-I  score  at  Visit  5  (day  3)  and  thereafter.  All  three  Zypadhera treatment groups were statistically superior to placebo in mean change of the PANSS Positive score by Visit 5 (Day 3) and maintained significance through the remainder of the study.

Overall study HGJZ demonstrated superiority over placebo of Zypadhera 300 mg/2 weeks,  405 mg/4 weeks and  210 mg/2 weeks in terms of decreased total PANSS from baseline after 8 weeks treatment in patients with schizophrenia and a PANSS-derived BPRS score of ≥ 48 (1 to 7 scale) at baseline not previously  considered to be treatment-resistant to olanzapine.

Study HGKA, a non-inferiority study versus oral olanzapine with placebo arm (45 mg/4 weeks low dose close to placebo, which ensure sensitive assay), assessed the efficacy and safety of three doses (150 mg/2 weeks, 300 mg/2 weeks, and 405 mg/4 weeks) of Zypadhera relative to oral olanzapine (10 to 20 mg) in the maintenance treatment (24 weeks) of schizophrenia.

Patients  treated  with  10  mg,  15  mg  or  20  mg  oral  olanzapine  were  then  randomized  in  45mg/4w, 150mg/2w, 405mg/4w or 300mg/2w OPD group or kept the same oral dose of olanzapine.

The randomization is necessary but introduces a bias into the double-blind comparison by creating an advantage for the randomly assigned oral olanzapine group that remained on its previous dose before and  after  randomization.  Actually,  patients  stabilized  by  oral  olanzapine  at  20  mg/day  may  be randomized in the OPD 150mg/2 weeks group, while patients randomized in oral olanzapine group would continue to receive the same efficacious and well tolerated dose.

The  primary  noninferiority  analysis  in  Study  F1D-MC-HGKA  was  a  comparison  of the  Pooled  2Week Zypadhera and the oral  olanzapine  treatment  groups  with  respect  to  exacerbation  rates.  The analysis showed Zypadhera in the pooled 2-week group analysis to be noninferior to oral olanzapine (10-20 mg).

Non-inferiority between the pooled 2- week Zypadhera group (300 mg/2 weeks and 150 mg/2 weeks) and the oral olanzapine group was observed on the exacerbation rates (respectively, 90 and 93%; 95% CI [-0.02, 0.08]).

Analysis  of  time  to  exacerbation  (p=0.167)  showed  non-inferiority  between  the  pooled  2-  week Zypadhera group and the oral olanzapine group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The analysis of the time to exacerbation shows superiority of the Zypadhera 405 mg/4 weeks, 300 mg/2  weeks  and  150  mg/2  weeks  (OPD405,  OPD300  and  OPD150)  versus  the  45  mg/4  weeks (OPD45) group, thus the two primary objectives of the maintenance study were reached.

No difference was observed between the Pooled 2-Week Zypadhera treatment group and the 405 mg/4 weeks Zypadhera treatment group with respect to survival (from exacerbation) rate, which was 90% for each group (95% CI for ∆ : -0.05, 0.05;). Therefore, the Pooled 2-Week Zypadhera treatment group was noninferior to the 405 mg/4 weeks Zypadhera treatment group with respect to exacerbation rates at 24 weeks after randomization.

Taking into account the principle of zero difference in risk (that is, clinically non significant) between a given oral dose and a given OP Depot dose as opposed to a statistically nonsignificant difference and in order to assess relative risk of relapse in Study HGKA, hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for each OP  Depot  dose  group  relative  to  the  patients  who  were  randomized  to  remain  on  their  oral  dose. Hazard ratios provide the likelihood of an event happening in a test group relative to the likelihood of it  happening  in  a  reference  group.  In  this  case,  the  event  is  relapse,  the  reference  group  is  the  oral olanzapine group (that is, those patients randomized to stay on their oral dose), and the test group is an OP Depot dose group. If the likelihood of relapse in an OP Depot dose group is the same as the oral olanzapine  group, the  HR will be  1.0.  However, if the  likelihood  of  relapse  in  the  OP  Depot  dose group is greater than that for oral olanzapine, the HR will be greater than 1, with the value reflecting how many times more likely the event is to occur in a given time frame. If the likelihood of relapse in the OP Depot dose group is lower than that for olanzapine, the HR will be less than 1. Therefore, a hazard ratio sufficiently close to 1.0 represents a dose which best approximates the efficacy of the oral dose in question and which is therefore the best starting dose when switching from that oral dose. Zypadhera treatment groups were statistically significantly superior to the 45 mg/4 weeks Zypadhera treatment  group  with  respect  to  hazard  ratios  of  exacerbation.  With  a  loading  dose  of  150  mg/  2 weeks, patients have a 2 times higher risk to relapse than with 10 mg oral olanzapine, while with a loading dose of 405 mg/4 weeks, patients have the same risk to relapse (HR=1.08 at 2 months and 1.03 at 6 months) than with 10 mg oral olanzapine. Furthermore, patients with a loading dose of 300 mg/2 weeks have the lower risk to relapse at 6 months when switching from 15 mg oral olanzapine.

Switching from oral treatment without a need to supplement with oral dosing would require sufficient (and comparable to oral dosing) efficacy starting from the first injection. For this reason, the CHMP asked the applicant to argue on the possible increased risk of exacerbation during the first months of treatment. The applicant suggested that for patients whose target oral olanzapine dose would be 10 or 15 mg/day, clinicians should initiate Zypadhera treatment at a dose higher than 150mg/2 weeks. As a consequence, an appropriate dosing scheme is included in section 4.2 of the SPC. This dosing scheme also  prevents  that  higher  doses  than  the  currently  approved  might  be  administered.  In  fact,  it  is indicated that  the combined total  dose  of  olanzapine  from  both  formulations should  not  exceed  the corresponding maximum oral olanzapine dose of 20 mg/day.

## The applied indication for Zypadhera initially was,

Treatment of schizophrenia. ZYPADHERA is effective in the treatment of patients who have previously been exposed to oral olanzapine.

Maintenance  treatment  of  schizophrenia.  ZYPADHERA  is  effective  in  maintaining  the  clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response to oral olanzapine.

According to the Appendix to Note for Guidance on the clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of schizophrenia - Methodology of clinical trials concerning the development of depot preparations  of  approved  medicinal  products  in  schizophrenia  (CPMP/EWP/49/01,  2003),  'Depot preparations are meant for maintenance treatment, once a patient is stabilised satisfactorily on an oral preparation.  Therefore  a  patient  usually  will  continue  on  the  product  that  has  been  shown  to  be effective for him. It would be very rare to start a patient on a depot preparation, as e.g. dose titration is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

not  possible,  an  acute  effect  may  be  needed  or  undesirable  effects  may  occur,  in  which  case  the preparation cannot be withdrawn'.

Results of study HKJZ (8-week randomized placebo controlled superiority study) are consistent with the  above  statement,  as  they  demonstrate  that  Zypadhera  starts  to  be  effective  in  the  treatment  of schizophrenia episodes from week 1, after the acute phase, and the steady state is reached not before 8 weeks.

Based on the above reasons, the CHMP considered that the indication proposed was not adequate, and further to additional discussion with the applicant the following indication was eventually agreed,

Maintenance  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  schizophrenia sufficiently  stabilised  during  acute treatment with oral olanzapine.

In addition, the below changes to the SPC sections 4.2 and 4.4 were agreed to ensure that the use of Zypadhera be limited to eligible patients only (patients already treated with oral olanzapine; no acute exacerbation treatment).

## Section 4.2:

'Patients  should  be  treated  initially  with  oral  olanzapine  before  administering  ZYPADHERA,  to establish tolerability and response'.

## Section 4.4:

\"ZYPADHERA should not be used to treat patients with schizophrenia who are in an acutely agitated or severely psychotic state such that immediate symptom control is warranted'.

## Clinical safety

- Patient exposure

In the analysis of exposure data (see table below), the total number of patients is 1778, whereas in the analysis of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), the total number of patients is 1779. This difference is due to 1 patient (HGJZ-47-5037) who was randomized to Zypadhera (Placebo-Controlled Database [HGJZ]), but discontinued study participation prior to the first injection. All available data (for example, AEs, vitals, etc.) for this patient are included in the safety analyses as applicable. The total number of patient exposures (1778) and the unique number of patient exposures (1719) presented in  this  summary  are  sufficient  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  ICH  E1  guidelines  on  the  extent  of population exposures to assess clinical safety (ICH 1994). At the time of datalock for this application, 445 patients had received at least 1 continuous year of treatment with Zypadhera. Among these 445 patients, 98.1% of the doses received by patients were equal to or greater than 150 mg.

- Adverse events

Sedation was the only AE reported statistically significantly (p=.036) more often in Zypadhera-treated patients  (8.2%)  than  in  placebo-treated  patients  (2.0%).  Sedation  is  a  common  TEAE  reported historically with oral olanzapine. The incidence of sedation seen in patients treated with Zypadhera in the  Placebo-Controlled  Database  was  lower  than  that  typically  seen  with  oral  olanzapine  and  most likely reflects the fact that 37.9% of the patients in study HGJZ had previous exposure to olanzapine and that the  vast  majority  (94.1%)  had  previous  exposure  to  1  or  more  antipsychotic  agents.  Note, sedation reported as a TEAE does not include IAIV injection events described elsewhere (special topic report for IAIV injection events (see later on).  In all other events for which a statistically significant between-group  difference  was  observed,  the  reported  incidence  was  higher  in  the  placebo  group compared with Zypadhera.

In  the  Olanzapine-Controlled Database no statistically significant overall difference between groups was  observed  in  the  incidence  of  patients  with  1  or  more  TEAE  (p=.147).  There  were  statistically significant  differences  between  groups  in  the  incidence  of  chest  pain  (p=.005),  menstrual  disorder (p=.043), parkinsonism (p=.042), and rhinitis (p=.042); although all of these events were reported only by  patients  receiving  oral  olanzapine.  These  findings  appear  to  be  spurious  and  do  not  imply  a substantial difference in the safety profile of the 2 olanzapine formulations.

In the Overall Integrated Database the most frequently reported TEAEs in 5% or more of patients were insomnia  (10.8%),  weight  increased  (8.4%),  anxiety  (7.8%),  headache  (7.3%),  somnolence  (6.7%), and  injection  site  pain  (5.5%).  All  of  these  events,  except  injection-site  pain  (expected  with  an injectable  product)  and  headache  (common  in  clinical  trials),  are  consistent  with  events  observed historically in patients treated with oral olanzapine or with symptoms of the disease state.

The incidence and severity of treatment-emergent injection-site-related AEs were compared between patients treated with Zypadhera and patients treated with placebo in the Placebo-Controlled Database. Incidence  and  severity  of  treatment-emergent  injection-site-related  AEs  were  also  summarized  for Zypadhera patients in the Overall Integrated Database. The key findings from these analyses were as follows: 1) The 11 injection-site-related AEs in the Placebo-Controlled Database were all reported by Zypadhera-treated patients. Of these events, 7 were reported to be related to injection-site pain, with 6 reported to have a maximum severity of 'mild' and 1 reported to be 'moderate.' 2) In the Overall Integrated Database, 8.5% of Zypadhera-treated patients reported 1 or more injection-site-related AEs. Injection-site pain was the most frequently reported event (5.5%). All other injection-site-related AEs occurred  in  &lt;1%  of  patients.  Overall,  injection-site-related  AEs  occurred  at  a  low  rate  and  the majority were reported to be of 'mild' severity. The rate of these events was generally consistent with rates  reported  in  other  products  intended  for  IM  administration.  The  most  common  injection-siterelated AE in either database was injection-site pain, which was reported by most patients as 'mild' in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

severity.  Four  patients  (4/1779,  0.2%)  discontinued  study  participation  because  of  injection-siterelated AEs.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

One  death  was  reported  across  all  Zypadhera  studies  (1/1779,  0.056%)  in  the  Overall  Integrated Database.  This  death  was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  unrelated  to  study  drug  or  to  study procedures.  Additional    2  deaths  have  occurred  in  the  ongoing  studies  Study  HGKB  and  1  death occurred in Study HGLQ (Patient HGLQ-300 3022). These 3 deaths occurred after the data cut-off date  for  this  application  (30  June  2006),  precluding  written  narratives.  Two  of  the  deaths  were  in patients receiving Zypadhera, whereas the other death occurred in a patient receiving oral olanzapine. According to the Lilly Safety System (LSS) report, 2 of the deaths were unrelated to study drug or study procedures (1 death due to sepsis, 1 death due to leptospirosis). The third death was due to heart failure but relatedness to treatment is unknown.

## Serious AEs

In  Placebo-Controlled  Database  nineteen  patients  reported  one  or  more  SAEs.  Most  events  were reported only once. Events reported in 2 or more patients in either treatment group included 4 reports of psychotic disorder in the Zypadhera group and 2 reports of schizophrenia (1 in Zypadhera and 1 in placebo).  There  was  an  additional  report  of  schizophrenia,  paranoid  type,  in  an  Zypadhera-treated patient.  By  event,  none  of  the  SAEs  were  reported  statistically  significantly  more  often  in  the Zypadhera group compared with the placebo group. Forty-two patients in the Olanzapine-Controlled Database reported 1 or more SAEs.  Most events were reported only once. Serious AEs reported in 2 or  more  patients  in  either  treatment  group  included  schizophrenia  (n=8),  acute  psychosis  (n=5), psychotic disorder (n=4), aggression (n=2), and paranoid type schizophrenia (n=2); all events that are consistent  with  symptoms  of  the  underlying  disease.  None  of  the  SAEs  were  reported  statistically significantly  more  often  in  the  Zypadhera  group  than  in  the  oral  olanzapine  group.  A  total  of  159 (8.9%)  patients  experienced  1  or  more  SAEs.  Most  events  were  reported  only  once.  Serious  AEs reported in 5 or more patients included psychotic disorder (n=34; 1.9%), schizophrenia (n=31; 1.7%), agitation (n=7; 0.4%), suicidal ideation (n=7; 0.4%), anxiety (n=6; 0.3%), auditory hallucination (n=6; 0.3%), paranoia (n=6; 0.3%), paranoid schizophrenia (n=5; 0.3%), and suicide attempt (n=6; 0.3%). Consistent  with  the  controlled  databases,  all  of  these  events  are  associated  with  symptoms  of  the underlying disease.

## IAIV events

Cases of inadvertent intravascular injection (IAIV) were reported by the applicant within the initial submission. The new cases that occurred after the submission of the application were also submitted and discussed.

The events presented with signs and symptoms consistent with olanzapine overdose which included dizziness,  confusion,  disorientation,  slurred  speech,  altered  gait,  weakness  or  reduced  level  of consciousness ranging from mild sedation to coma.

For the cases submitted initially, based on an estimated 25,716 injections, the inadvertent intravascular ( IAIV) injection events (16) have occurred in 0.06% of injections. For the 11 events in which time to onset  of  symptoms  was  specified,  the  onset  was  within  the  first  hour  for  10  events,  ranging  from immediately after an injection to 45 minutes. The time to onset for the 11th event was 90 minutes. None  of  the  IAIV  injection  events  involved  sudden  onset  of  profound  sedation  or  incapacitation; instead, all began with milder symptoms, which progressed to more severe symptoms in some events. In general, the later the onset of symptoms, the slower their progression. All patients fully recovered from the events, and the majority continued to receive further injections of Zypadhera.

Lists of all IAIV injection events occurring up to 30 April 2007 were presented. A total of 19 events were listed of which 5 were classified as definite, 8 as probable, 5 as possible and 1 as unlikely. Time of onset after the injection ranged from immediate to within 60 min in those events that were listed as definite. In other 14 cases time of onset ranged from 5 min to 2 hours 45 min.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In an event of IAIV, one would expect the onset of symptoms to be from immediate to a few minutes. The fact that e.g. in a well documented case the onset of symptoms was 45 min after the injection and coincided with a high peak concentration is concerning. Upon request of the CHMP the applicant has discussed other possible mechanism than IAIV that may explain the delay in symptoms. They include mechanisms  by  which  the  suspension  comes  into  contact  with  blood.  These  other  imaginable mechanisms (other than IAIV) discussed in the response represent conditions that can explain dose dumping with certain amount of delay after the injection. It is however reassuring that the incidence of these  events  reported  in  the  studies  was  roughly  similar  to  that  that  has  been  reported  for  IAIV  of penicillin G procaine and that the root cause seems not to be within the quality of the manufactured product. However, these mechanisms are only assumptions, gathering information from future IAIV injection and other related events leading to very high peak concentrations is essential.

New IAIV cases: On 28 th February 2008, the applicant informed the CHMP of 3 further cases reports of patient with an inadvertent intravascular event (IAIV). One of this IAIV was with onset occurring &gt;3  hours  post-injection.  This  new  case  which  originated  in  Mexico  has  been  investigated  by  the applicant's clinicians and it would appear that the onset of the IAIV did occur later than 3 hours postinjection and before 5 hours, but a more precise timing was not possible.

As of 30 May 2008, a total of 29 IAIV injection events have been identified in 28 patients during OP Depot  clinical  trials.    Based  on  more  than  40,000  OP  Depot  injections  given  to  2054  patients  in clinical trials through 30 May 2008, IAIV injection events have occurred in approximately 0.07% of injections, or 1.4% of patients.

According  to  these  findings,  the  onset  of  signs  and  symptoms  may  be  between  5  minutes  and  &lt;5 hours, and the symptomatology very likely might represent a medical emergency. As a consequence, the CHMP requested the applicant to adopt adequate measures for monitoring the patients after the administration of Zypadhera.

The following measures were agreed:

- After  each  injection,  patients  should  be  observed  in  a  healthcare  facility  by  appropriately qualified personnel for at least 3 hours.
- Patients should be accompanied to their destination after the observation period.
- Patients should be informed that they should not drive or operate machinery for the remainder of the day of the injection.
- Patients should pay attention for signs and symptoms of an IAIV injection event and be able to obtain assistance if needed for the remainder of the day of the injection.

The risk of IAIV events will also be addressed by the RMP.

The  CHMP also  recommended that  the  term  IAIV  should  be  replaced  by  the  term  'Post  injection syndrome' in future materials, as this terminology would maybe draw more efficiently the attention of the prescribers on the risks associated with these administrations.

## · Laboratory findings

In the Placebo-Controlled Database statistically significant differences in mean changes were observed between treatment groups for  the  following laboratory  analytes:  monocytes,  eosinophils,  creatinine, sodium, albumin, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin. For each analyte, the absolute mean change was generally very small. Though the difference  between  groups  was  not  statistically  significant,  Zypadhera-treated  patients  showed  a significant within-group decrease of -5.80 µg/L and placebo treated patients showed a non-significant within-group decrease of -4.11 µg/L in prolactin. With respect to prolactin level, this decrease was not unexpected because many patients in this group received previous antipsychotic medications (39.4% with risperidone and 25.7% with haloperidol prior to randomization to Zypadhera or placebo, and as some of these medications have a greater effect on prolactin (David et al. 2000).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A statistically significant between-treatment group difference was observed for low leukocyte count (p=.003); 4/94 (4.3%) placebo-treated patients had low leukocyte counts compared with 0/293 (0.0%) of Zypadhera-treated patients. Although not statistically significant between groups, 35/160 (21.9%) Zypadhera-treated patients had high prolactin levels at endpoint compared with 7/47 (14.9%) placebotreated  patients.  This  finding  was  not  unexpected  and  is  consistent  with  the  Olanzapine  Core  Data Sheet,  which  states  that  increases  in  prolactin  are  very  common  and  have  been  seen  in  34%  of olanzapine treated patients in historical placebo-controlled studies.

In  the  Olanzapine-Controlled  Database  statistically  significant  differences  were  observed  between treatment groups for eosinophils, GGT, and sodium; although none of these differences were clinically meaningful. With respect to prolactin, small and clinically insignificant mean decreases were observed at endpoint in both treatment groups (Zypadhera [-1.90 µg/L] and oral olanzapine [-1.79 µg/L]).

In  the  Overall  Integrated  Database  statistically  significant  within-treatment  group  changes  were observed  for  hemoglobin,  mean  cell  hemoglobin  (MCH),  leukocyte  count,  segmented  neutrophils, monocytes, MCV, ALKPH, creatinine, calcium, potassium, fasting glucose, nonfasting glucose, total bilirubin,  and  prolactin.  These  changes  were  very  small  increases  or  decreases,  and  not  clinically meaningful.  A  statistically  significant  mean  decrease  in  prolactin  (-.09  µg/L)  was  observed  at endpoint.

The  incidence  of  patients  with  abnormal  high  or  low  ALT/SGPT  values  and  potentially  clinically significant  changes  (PCS)  in  ALT/SGPT  values  was  examined  for  all  3  databases.  An  additional analysis  of  the  incidence  of  patients  with  ALT/SGPT  elevations  3  or  more  times  the  ULN  was evaluated  for  the  Placebo-Controlled  Database.  In  this  analysis,  changes  &gt;3  x  ULN  in  ALT/SGPT values were observed in 2.7% (8/291) of patients treated with Zypadhera compared with 3.2% (3/94) of patients treated with placebo. None of these patients experienced jaundice. Review of case report form  data  revealed  that  in  3  of  these  patients,  liver  enzymes  reverted  to  the  normal  range  despite continued treatment, and in 5 patients enzyme values decreased but were still above the normal range at  the  end  of  therapy.  In  the  analysis  of  clinically  significant  changes  in  the  Overall  Integrated Database,  1614  patients  had  baseline  ALT/SGPT  levels ≤ 90  U/L.  The  incidence  of  ALT/SGPT elevations to &gt;200 U/L was 0.7% (12/1614). Again, none of these 12 patients experienced jaundice or other  symptoms  attributable  to  liver  impairment,  and  most  had  transient  changes  that  tended  to normalize  while  olanzapine  treatment  was  continued.  Among  the  1778  exposures  in  Zypadhera clinical trials, about 0.4% (7/1778) of patients who discontinued study participation did so because of transaminase increases. None of these 7 patients had jaundice.

In the analysis of PCS changes in CPK levels, 39/1618 (2.4%) of Zypadhera-treated patients met the criteria for high CPK levels. Ten of these patients had CPK levels greater than 5000 U/L. Although some elevation of CPK levels would be expected as a result of the trauma caused by an IM injection, the  case  report  forms  for  these  10  patients  with  very  high  levels  of  CPK  were  carefully  reviewed. Three had documented possible causes for the elevated CPK level (seizure, exercise, and a fall), while the remaining 7 cases had no easily identified cause. Most very high elevations in CPK were transient and later returned to lower levels. There were no reports of rhabdomyolysis or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in any of the patients in Zypadhera studies.

In  the  mean  change  analyses,  prolactin  levels  in  both  the  Placebo-  and  Olanzapine-  Controlled Databases showed a small mean decrease for Zypadhera-treated patients. This finding may have been driven  by  previous  antipsychotic  treatments  prior  to  study  enrolment.  However,  despite  this  small mean decrease, 20.0% of Zypadhera-treated patients with normal baseline prolactin levels and at least one  postbaseline  value  (N=679)  had  abnormally  high  prolactin  levels  as  seen  in  the  analysis  of abnormally high laboratory analytes in the Overall Integrated Database. Notably, a large number of patients (512 of 1478, 34.6%) had high prolactin levels at baseline, which supports the argument that this  was  due  to  previous  antipsychotic  treatment.  Patients  with  high  baseline  prolactin  levels  were excluded  from  the  analysis.  The  distribution  of  maximum  postbaseline  high  values  was  further evaluated  for  most  patients  with  abnormally  high  values  postbaseline,  the  maximum  postbaseline value was &lt;30 µg/L (64%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Changes in weight, prolactin, and fasting triglyceride levels were reviewed by dose in the 24-week double-blind maintenance of effect study (HGKA). Weight, prolactin, and fasting triglycerides showed significant differences in the Zypadhera doses. Patients treated with 300 mg/2 weeks Zypadhera had statistically  significantly  higher  mean  changes  in  prolactin  and  a  higher  incidence  of  high  fasting triglycerides postbaseline compared with the 405 mg/4 weeks and 150 mg/2 weeks Zypadhera doses. Similarly, patients treated with 300 mg/2 weeks Zypadhera also had a statistically significantly higher mean increase in weight than patients treated with 150 mg/2 weeks Zypadhera.

Olanzapine use in general is commonly associated with metabolic adverse effects and metabolic risks associated with Zypadhera are considered to be similar than those with oral olanzapine. The applicant has been asked to reinforce the monitoring measures by emphasising these aspects in the SPC and with the RMP.

## · Safety in special populations

No  clinically  meaningful  differences  were  observed  in  any  subgroup  of  interest  with  respect  to TEAEs, laboratory measurements, vital signs and weight, and ECGs.

Information about intrinsic factor pharmacokinetic studies (such as renal and hepatic) has also been analyzed.    Specifically,  the  results  of  the  historical  special  population  and  drug  interaction  studies performed  with  olanzapine  are  reliable  characterizations  of  what  to  expect  with  Zypadhera  use  in similar  clinical  circumstances.  Zypadhera  product  should  be  administered  to  patients  with  the  clear understanding that continuous stable treatment with olanzapine over the next few weeks to months is foreseen as clinically appropriate. Once the Zypadhera dose has been administered intramuscularly, the  sustained  release  and  absorption  of  olanzapine  will  be  continuous  for  some  time.  In  general, however,  it  is  anticipated  that  use  of  Zypadhera  may  not  be  suitable  for  patients  with  clinically significant hepatic or renal impairment, especially if dosage requirements are likely to change in the near term. As a result of the intended similarities of drug exposure, currently approved labelling with regard to this special population will be useful. The SPC recommendation will be that unless a welltolerated  and  effective  dosage  regimen  using  oral  olanzapine  has  been  established  in  such  patients, Zypadhera should not be used. When switching patients using an oral dose of olanzapine less than 10 mg/day, a corresponding dose of Zypadhera should be recommended. For example, for patients using an oral dose of 5 mg olanzapine per day, a dose of 150 mg every 4 weeks is the recommended starting dose for Zypadhera.

Extrinsic  factors  such as  alcohol  or tobacco  use  and  food  habits  were  not specifically  collected  for analysis  with  clinical  trial  data.  A  population  pharmacokinetics  analysis  was  performed  to  evaluate whether gender and smoking status significantly influence olanzapine pharmacokinetics. The analysis revealed that gender and smoking status significantly influence olanzapine pharmacokinetics. Existing oral  olanzapine labelling addresses safety outcomes as they relate to smoking status, as well as use with alcohol, and other central nervous system depressants. Thus, Zypadhera product labelling with respect to extrinsic factors will reflect the information, where relevant and appropriate, from currently approved labels for the oral olanzapine formulation.

## · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with Zypadhera. Due to similarities in metabolism and elimination, the results of the drug interaction studies performed with oral and RAIM olanzapine are a reliable characterization of what to expect with Zypadhera in a similar situation. Consequently, the product labelling for Zypadhera will reflect the information, where relevant and appropriate, from the currently approved labels for the oral and RAIM formulations.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

A total of 404 patients began double-blind treatment, and of these, 267 (66.1%) patients completed. The most common reasons for discontinuing the study during this period were lack of efficacy (n=59) and  patient  decision  (n=45).  There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  (p=.167)  across treatment groups for overall reasons for discontinuation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall,  the  numbers  of  patient  exposure  are  low  to  allow  firm  conclusions  based  on  the  safety  of olanzapine pamoate formulations only. On the other hand, patient exposure to olanzapine from other olanzapine formulations is extensive. Generally, all potential or identified safety issues that have been observed  based  on  oral  olanzapine  data  are  relevant  to  olanzapine  pamoate  as  well.  Potential  new safety issues that would be unique to olanzapine pamoate formulation should be considered based on characteristics of this formulation and its IM dosing include the following:

- Possible local irritation at injection site
- Possible  safety  issues  relating  to  highly  variable  absorption  of  olanzapine  pamoate  both between patients and within a patient (under-dosing, over-dosing)
- Possible local irritation in the muscle tissue
- Possibility of dose dumping
- Possible safety issues related to pamoic acid exposure (systemic and local)
- Safety in case of inadvertent intravascular injection or injection into adipose tissue
- Possibilities  of  absorption  kinetics  to  be  affected  by  variability  in  injection  technique  (e.g. injection pressure)
- Discussion on clinical safety

Overall, the safety profile of Zypadhera is consistent with the one of the oral form. Occurrence and profile of adverse events and laboratory findings are consistent with events observed in patients treated with oral olanzapine or with symptoms of the disease state.

Increase in weight and impairment of glucose and lipids metabolism are frequently reported with the use  of  olanzapine,  and  the  same  is  expected  to  happen  with  Zypadhera.  The  metabolic  aspect  of olanzapine represents a main concern for the CHMP who therefore asked the applicant to reinforce the monitoring  measures  already  in  place.  The  applicant  agreed  to  revise  the  SPC  of  Zypadhera  to improve  monitoring  of  hyperglycaemia,  and  weight.  Instead  of  suggesting  in  the  SPC  a  particular scheme  for  the  baseline  and  follow-up  monitoring  of  weight,  glucose  and  lipids,  it  was  agreed  to determine,  on  a  national  basis,  the  most  appropriate  guidelines  for  metabolic  monitoring  and  to provide the prescribers with a copy of these guidelines. The applicant will address this through the RMP.

However, specific aspects related to the different formulation were identified.

In  particular, the  IAIV events (or post-injection syndrome) deserve the utmost consideration. These events occurred in about 1.4% of the patients during the clinical development, and this figure - which is  already  relevant  considering  the  controlled  setting  of  a  clinical  trial  -  is  likely  to  increase  in  the clinical practice once the product is put on the market.

The proposed methods to monitor patients after the injection (mainly based on adequate post-injection observation of the patient before and after permanence in the healthcare facility, accurate information to  the  patient  and  caregivers  of  possible  signs  and  symptoms  of  IAIV)  appear  to  be  a  reasonable measure to grant adequate safety, for the time being. When switching from oral olanzapine treatment there is a risk of post injection syndrome (IAIV event) when using Zypadhera, but it must be taken into account that there is also a decreased possibility for intentional overdose (suicidality is common in patients with schizophrenia) when compared to oral olanzapine. However, more details on future IAIV  events  need  to  be  collected  to  further  clarify  and  monitor  the  issue,  and  the  healthcare professionals and patients should be thoroughly informed by specific programs that will be part of the RMP.

Another  aspect  specific  for  Zypadhera  was  represented  by  the  treatment-emergent  injection-siterelated AEs. The analysis of all these events demonstrated that injection-site pain is the most common event  (5.5%  in  the  Overall  Integrated  Database)  and  that  most  patients  reported  it  as  'mild'  in severity. It can be concluded that, injection-site pain is an expected event with the use of an IM drug and the reported incidence is not of particular concern.

There are no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The nonclinical profile of olanzapine has been extensively evaluated for the oral and the rapid acting intramuscular  forms.  The  new  data  provided  with  this  submission  were  mainly  intended  for characterization  of  the  absorption  of  the  salt  form  and  the  possible  toxicological  impact  due  to  the different  extent  of  the  exposure.  Pamoic  acid  is  also  well  absorbed,  therefore  specific  studies  were performed to evaluate the fate of this compound.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  rat,  dog,  and  rabbit,  OP  Depot  produced  initial  peak  plasma  concentrations  of  olanzapine  and pamoate  followed  by  a  gradual  decline  in  concentrations  for  up  to  28  days  postdose.  Plasma concentrations of olanzapine following the administration of OP Depot increased with increasing dose. Plasma concentrations of pamoic acid were greater following the administration of pamoic acid alone compared  to  the  administration  of  OP  Depot.  The  plasma  profiles  of  pamoic  acid  following administration of OP Depot were qualitatively similar to those obtained following administration of pamoic acid alone. The above results support the claim for a sustained release of OP Depot.

It  was  also  concluded  that  pamoic  acid,  derived  from  the  pamoate  salt,  is  absorbed  and  rapidly excreted unchanged in nonclinical species. Injection site reaction were common.

No  other  specific  toxicological  concerns  were  associated  with  use  of  OP  Depot  in  the  nonclinical setting.

## Efficacy

Olanzapine (oral) is an antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder, maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder, and agitation associated with schizophrenia  and  bipolar  I  mania.  Preclinical  pharmacology  studies  indicate  that  olanzapine  has significant  activity  in  dopaminergic,  serotonergic,  muscarinic,  alpha1-adrenergic,  and  histaminergic systems. Olanzapine is suitable for both oral and parenteral administration. Oral (coated tablets and orodispersible tablets) and rapid-acting intramuscular (RAIM) olanzapine formulations are approved for  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia,  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  manic  episodes,  and  the prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in patients with bipolar disorder in the European Union. The availability of new depot formulation may provide a new tool to increase patient compliance to treatment is some patients suffering from schizophrenia.

The  data  provided  with  study  HGKZ,  a  8-week  randomized  placebo  controlled  superiority  study, showed  that  mean  decreases  in  PANSS  total  scores  compared  to  placebo  arm  from  baseline  to endpoint (week 8) were as follows: Zypadhera 300 mg/2 weeks: 17.81 points (p&lt;0.001), Zypadhera 405 mg/4 weeks: 14.06 points (p&lt;0.001), Zypadhera 210 mg/2 weeks: 13.98 points (p&lt;0.001). All Zypadhera  treatments  were  superior  to  placebo  from  week  1  visit  on  and  continued  to  be  more effective through-out the study period. None of the Zypadhera treatments were superior to any one of two  other  Zypadhera  treatments  over  8  weeks.  Based  on  these  findings  it  can  be  concluded  that Zypadhera is superior to placebo in the treatment of schizophrenia.

The  maintenance  treatment  study  HGKA,  a 24-week  randomized  active  controlled  versus  oral olanzapine non inferiority study, was meant to give support to the long-term efficacy claimed by the indication. The objectives were to demonstrate non inferior efficacy of Zypadhera as compared to oral olanzapine in terms of exacerbation rates after 24 weeks, and superior efficacy of 300 mg/ 2weeks, 405 mg/4 weeks, and 15 mg/2weeks as compared to 45 mg/2 weeks (low dose close to placebo) in terms of time to exacerbation of symptoms of schizophrenia. Analysis of the first primary variable showed that Zypadhera in the pooled 2-week group analysis was no inferior to oral olanzapine (10-20 mg). However, analysis of the distribution of time to exacerbation indicated an earlier appearance of events  in  the  Zypadhera  group  compared  to  the  oral  group.  This  is  explicable  due  to  the  slow absorption  of  Zypadhera.  Since  the  prescribers  must  be  aware  of  the  possible  implications  when switching from oral treatment, a recommended dosing scheme is proposed in the SPC.

## Safety

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in table 5.1 adequately addressed these.

Overall, the safety profile of the product seems to be consistent to oral olanzapine. It is of note that the use of depot olanzapine formulation does not provide any further advantage in the overall exposure on olanzapine when compared to the use of traditional formulation. The main safety concern related to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Zypadhera  compared  to  oral  olanzapine  is  the  possibility  of  the  so  called  inadvertent  intravascular injections (IAIV, term to be replaced by 'Post injection syndrome'). These events have occurred in &lt;0.1%  of  injections  and  approximately  1.4%  of  patients.  Most  of  these  patients  have  developed symptoms  of  sedation  (ranging  from  mild  in  severity  up  to  coma)  and/or  delirium  (including confusion,  disorientation,  agitation,  anxiety  and  other  cognitive  impairment).  In  most  cases,  initial signs and symptoms related to this event have appeared within 1-5 hours following injection, and in all cases full recovery was reported to have occurred within 24 - 72 hours after injection.

The CHMP considers Post injection syndrome as a major safety issue, for this reason has requested the applicant to analyse all the events and submit all relevant details either during the assessment of the application and through postmarketing measures.

Other  symptoms  noted  include  extrapyramidal  symptoms,  dysarthria,  ataxia,  aggression,  dizziness, weakness, hypertension and convulsion.

Olanzapine  use  in  general  is  commonly  associated  with  metabolic  adverse  effects.  Metabolic  risks associated with Zypadhera are considered to be similar than those with oral olanzapine. The applicant will however reinforce the monitoring measures by emphasising these aspects in the SPC and with the RMP.

## · User consultation

The user test consultation provided is satisfactory.

## Risk-benefit assessment

Overall  benefit-risk  assessment  in  the maintenance  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  schizophrenia sufficiently stabilised during acute treatment with oral olanzapine is considered to be positive. When switching from oral olanzapine treatment there is a risk of post injection syndrome (IAIV event) when using  Zypadhera,  but  it  must  be  taken  into  account  that  there  is  also  a  decreased  possibility  for intentional  overdose  (suicidality  is  common  in  patients  with  schizophrenia)  when  compared  to  oral olanzapine. Risks for metabolic adverse effects do not change when switching from oral olanzapine. However,  upon  request  of  the  CHMP  the  applicant  committed  to  put  in  place  measures  to  further improve monitoring of metabolic changes. Switching from oral olanzapine Zypadhera offers a way to increase  compliance  to  olanzapine  treatment  which  is  a  major  benefit  in  patients  that  respond favourably to olanzapine but have poor compliance to the treatment.

The  CHMP  granted  Zypadhera  access  to  the  centralised  procedure  under  'automatic  access'  as  a substance already approved via the centralised procedure (olanzapine), based on the assumption that the  pamoate  salt  form  does  not  differ  from  olanzapine  with  respect  to  safety  and  efficacy.  The assessment of Zypadhera dossier confirmed that conclusion

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

-  pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns

plus the following additional risk minimisation activities were required: see as detailed in section 2.3

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  ZYPADHERA  in  the maintenance  treatment  of  adult patients  with  schizophrenia  sufficiently  stabilised  during  acute  treatment  with  oral  olanzapine was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
