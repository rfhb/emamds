Therefore the MAH submitted in November 2011 the second renewal application of Ketek. During the 5-year period several actions has been taken such as scrutinising several safety issues, restriction in 2 of the 3 indications, termination of the paediatric development programme and survey of off-label prescription. Based on the above actions, followed by a decrease in the prescription of telithromycin, the benefit risk profile of Ketek remains positive. No additional safety issues have been identified that require further action. The CHMP was of the opinion that the renewal can be granted with unlimited validity. authorised   |

Following a CHMP request for revision of the information on concomitant use of statins, the MAH conducted a re-evaluation by means of literature research. Use of simvastatin, lovastatin or atorvastatin was already classified as a contraindication due to evidence for pharmacokinetic interaction resulting in high statin blood levels which are connected with risk of adverse reactions. The information was updated for other statins and patients should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when co-treated with pravastatin, authorised                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| II/0047   | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet To update the SPC sections 4.4 and 4.5 on monitoring rhabdomyolysis with statins, 4.7 to include confusion and hallucination and 4.8 to add the reported adverse reactions anosmia, agueusia, hypersensitivity, arthralgia, myalgia, confusion and hallucination following CHMP request after evaluation of PSUR 12. Section 2 of the PL was updated accordingly. The PL was amended in line with the User Testing and the contact list for the MAH Representatives in Belgian, Spain, France, Ireland, Latvia and Norway was updated. Furthermore, the annex II was revised to update the PSUR submission from every 6 month to once a year as agreed by the CHMP following assessment of PSUR 12. product | 25/09/2008   | 28/10/2008 no | SmPC, Annex II and PL longer | Following spontaneous reports of anosmia, agueusia, hypersensitivity, arthralgia, myalgia, confusion and hallucination, section 4.8 of the SPC was updated to include these adverse reactions. Two cases of rhabdomyolysis associated with concomitant HMG CoA reductase inhibitor were reported. This co-administration has the potential for interaction via CYP3A4 inhibition by telithromycin leading to increased statin levels. Therefore, the paragraph on statins on section 4.5 was revised and patients should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis. Furthermore, a cross-reference to section 4.5 was included in section 4.4 on the paragraph concerning treatment with other products that are metabolised by CYP3A4. Section 4.7 was update to warn about potential confusion or hallucination. Patients should attempt to minimize activities such as driving a motor vehicle, operating heavy machinery or engaging in other hazardous activities during treatment |

| II/0040 | To update sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8 of Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to strengthen the information on hepatic safety and to include fatalities in patients with myasthenia gravis. This follows a complete review of available safety data. The Package Leaflet (PL) was updated accordingly. In addition, following CHMP request the PL was revised to better reflect the information included in the SPC. Furthermore, the MAH completed the list of local representatives in the PL to include the two new Member States (Bulgaria and Romania) and to update the format of the PL according to the latest EMEA/QRD template. The MAH also took the opportunity to update the contact details for Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Portugal, Finland and Sweden. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet product | 16/11/2006 | 04/01/2007 no | SmPC and PL | A total of 364 spontaneous case reports of hepatic adverse events have been received up to 20 April 2006. The majority represented mild-moderate and reversible hepatic injury. Worldwide a total of 104 reports of acute severe liver injury were identified. This corresponds to a global reporting rate of 4 reports of acute severe liver injury per million exposures. Based on the review of these hepatic reactions, section 4.3 \"Contraindications\", was revised to include a contraindication in patients with a previous history of hepatitis and/or jaundice associated with the use of telithromycin. Furthermore, in section 4.4 \"Special warnings and precautions for use\" the sentence concerning hepatic safety was updated adding that the post-marketing cases of severe hepatitis and liver failure have generally been associated with serious underlying diseases or concomitant medications. Additionally following CHMP request this warning was updated to include the reporting of fatal cases of severe hepatitis and liver failure as with some of the 7 fatal cases worldwide related to liver injury a causal relationship to telithromycin is at least possible. Based on a review of cases of fatal myasthenia gravis and the potentially life-threatening nature inherent in aggravating myasthenia gravis, an association of fatal myasthenic crisis with telithromycin can not be ruled out. Five cases of fatal aggravation of myasthenia gravis and plausible temporal relationship to telithromycin treatment were identified.

| II/0037 | To update section 4.2 \"Posology and method of administration\" and 5.2 \"Pharmacokinetic properties\" of the Summary of Product Characteristics to introduce pharmacokinetic information related to patients with severe renal impairment and correspondent dose recommendations. Furthermore, in section 4.3 \"Contraindications\" a new contraindication was introduced in patients with severely impaired renal and/or hepatic function and taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as protease inhibitors or ketokonazole. These changes are reflected in section 2 \"Before you take Ketek\" and 3 \"How to take Ketek\" of the Package Leaflet. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet product | 21/09/2006 | 26/10/2006 no | SmPC and PL | The MAH has submitted this variation to update the pharmacokinetic information related to patients with severe renal impairment and corresponding dose recommendation (to treated patients with alternating daily doses of 800 mg and 400 mg). This update is based on an additional study to assess pharmacokinetics and the safety of telithromycin in patients with renal impairment after multiple oral administration of 400, 600, and 800 mg once a day for 5 days. In order to support a dosage recommendation in patients with severe renal impairment, additional analysis was conducted using population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and simulation. The results of the pharmacokinetic study clearly showed that a daily dose of 400 mg resulted in too low exposure. The results showed a 1.4 fold increase in Cmax,ss and a 2 fold increase in AUC(0-24)ss at the 800 mg dose in the severe renal impaired group (CLcr <30ml/min) compared to healthy subjects. The MAH was requested to discuss the increased exposure in relation to safety data at higher exposures and concludes that telithromycin was well tolerated during these aforementioned PK studies. No specific safety concerns have arisen. However, the CHMP considered that the interpretation of these results may be complicated by small sample size and that patients with severe renal impairment could be inherently more sensitive for side effects of telithromycin. Therefore, it may be necessary to be more cautious and conservative for the dosing in the subjects with severe renal impairment than that for the healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetic study showed that a daily dose of 600 longer authorised |

mg resulted in approximately the same AUC(0-24)ss in the severe renal impaired group (CLcr &lt; 30 ml/min) compared to 800 mg in healthy subjects.

Based on simulated data an alternating daily dosing regimen of 800 mg and 400 mg in patients with severe renal impairment would give approximately the same AUC(0-48h) as 800 mg daily in healthy subjects. Due to compliance concerns on the alternating daily dosing regimen, the MAH had been repeatedly asked during this assessment to further explore the possibilities to formulate dividable 400 mg tablets or a lower strength. According to the MAH 400 mg tablets are film-coated to mask the strong bitter taste of telithromycin and therefore he decided not to formulate dividable 400 mg tablets and expose the patients to the drug bitterness. The MAH is also not in favour of a lower strength because of the claimed difficulties in provision of the 300 mg formulation of Ketek in the EU. As the CHMP did not consider the alternate 400/800 mg optimal, Ketek cannot be considered as first choice treatment in patients with severe renal impairment.

There is limited pharmacokinetic and safety data in patients with impaired renal and liver function, and taking CYP3A inhibitors, increasing exposure. Therefore, a conservative approach indicating that telithromycin should not be used in patients with severely impaired renal and/or hepatic function and receiving concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors was considered appropriate until relevant data are available.

Based on the CHMP review of the available information and on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit/risk balance, the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considered that

Higher renal elimination was observed in the hepatically impaired patients. This data suggests that no dose adjustments are required, but because of the limited number of subjects included and because there are very few subjects with possible decreased metabolic capacity of the liver, telithromycin should still be used with caution in this group of patients. |

| II/0036 | To update section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC in order to introduce stronger warnings related to liver disorders and to reflect this change in section 2 and 4 of the PL. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 23/02/2006 | 22/03/2006 no | SmPC and PL | Following the evaluation of data of hepatotoxicity from published cases, clinical trials and reported cases in PSURs the CHMP considered necessary to update the SPC introducing stronger warnings related to liver disorders. Alterations in hepatic enzymes have been commonly observed in clinical studies with telithromycin. Postmarketing cases of severe hepatitis and liver failure have been reported. These hepatic reactions were observed during or immediately after treatment and in most cases were reversible after discontinuation of telithromycin.
