The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) applied for a new restricted indication in children eight years and older for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections.

Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC.

The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance.

In addition, an updated RMP is proposed.

The variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0292/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0292/2014 was completed.

The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0292/2014.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Tigecycline is a semisynthetic derivative of minocycline with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including inhibition of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, atypical, and anaerobic bacteria. It is active against multidrug-resistant  (MDR)  Gram-positive  and  Gram-negative  bacteria,  including  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus  aureus (MRSA),  penicillin-resistant Streptococcus  pneumoniae (PRSP),  vancomycinresistant Enterococcus species (VRE), and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae . Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Proteeae ( Proteus species and related organisms) are notable exceptions to the broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline. In addition, some species such as Bacteroides fragilis and Acinetobacter baumannii show a wide distribution of their susceptibility to tigecycline.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tygacil  is  indicated  in  adults  for  the  treatment  of  complicated  skin  and  soft  tissue  infections  (cSSTI), excluding  diabetic  foot  infections,  and  for  complicated  intra-abdominal  infections  (cIAI).  Tygacil  was approved  for  these  indications  in  the  EU  on  24  April  2006.  After  the  last  renewal  in  February  2011 (EMA/CHMP/100477/2011), the indications were restricted and Tygacil was approved to be used only in situations where it is known or suspected that other alternatives are not suitable.

The MAH is submitting an extension of indication for the restricted use of Tygacil in paediatric patients ≥8 years to &lt;18 years of age. The proposed indications for tigecycline in children are the same as those for adults. Similarly to adults, the labelling will specify that tigecycline is only to be used in children only in situations where other alternatives are not suitable.

The  use  of  tigecycline  in  children  younger  than  8  years  old  may  be  associated  with  permanent  tooth discolouration if used during tooth development. A waiver was granted by the Paediatric Committee in children &lt;8 years of age in December 2008. In the frame of modification 04 (M04) of the initially agreed PIP  (EMEA-000120-PIP01-07),  the  MAH  requested  that  the  paediatric  PIP  safety  and  efficacy  phase  3 studies in children aged 8 years to less than 18 years with complicated skin and soft tissue infections and with  complicated  intra-abdominal  infections  should  not  be  conducted,  due  to  the  safety  concerns identified in adults. In addition, the MAH anticipated that some changes will need to be implemented in the SmPC, but none of them would allow the inclusion of dosing recommendations in section 4.2, as there was no paediatric indication in section 4.1.

However, as tigecycline may constitute the only alternative for children with infections produced by multiresistant (mainly Gram-negative) microorganisms, the MAH proposed this extension of indication in which the  CHMP  should  assess  whether,  based  on  the  current  available  data,  a  very  restricted  (last  line) indication in children can be granted, accompanied by the inclusion of dosing recommendations and of all necessary cautionary warnings in the SmPC. Currently, the approved Tygacil SmPC reflects paediatric PK data from studies 110 and 2207 (see section on pharmacokinetics in this report), but in section 4.2 it is stated  that a recommendations on a posology cannot be made. The PIP modification 04 was withdrawn and the MAH submitted a further modification on an agreed PIP (M05) proposing a last line indication for the approved adult indications in children aged 8 years and older.

According  to  the  'Addendum  to  the  guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  medicinal  products  indicated  for treatment  of  bacterial  infections'  (EMA/CHMP/351889/2013),  limited  evidence  of  clinical  safety  and efficacy  could  be  accepted  to  support  an  initial  approval  for  the  treatment  of  infections  caused  by multidrug-resistant  (MDR)  organisms  for  which  there  are  few  therapeutic  options.  Assuming  that  the PK/PD analyses strongly support an expectation of clinical efficacy against problematic MDR pathogens, the  clinical  programme  should  take  into  account  the  properties  of  the  test  antibacterial  agent  (e.g. spectrum of activity) and the unmet need it may be able to address.

As  a  consequence,  this  report  addresses  whether  the  current  data  allow  granting  such  a  restricted indication.  Within M05 it was also agreed with the PDCO that the safety and efficacy studies previously mentioned would not be performed, as it was highly unlikely that enrolment in these studies was feasible due to the safety concerns identified in adult patients that had already resulted in the reassessment of the benefit-risk of Tygacil and in the restriction of the adult indication.

The proposed indications for tigecycline in  children,  and  the  proposed labelling  language  (Summary  of Product Characteristics, Section 4.1 Therapeutic indications) are as follows:

'Tygacil  is  indicated  in  adults  and  in  children  eight  years  and  older  for  the  treatment  of  the  following infections:

- Complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI), excluding diabetic foot infections
- Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tygacil should be used in adults only in situations where it is known or suspected that other alternatives are not suitable.

Due  to  limited  safety  and  efficacy  data  in  children,  Tygacil  is  only  to  be  used  in  children  when  no alternative antibacterial drugs are available.

Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.'

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new nonclinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

In accordance with the CHMP guidance EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 \"Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use\", an evaluation of the environmental impact should be made if  there  is  an  increase  in  the  environmental  exposure.  CHMP  agreed  that  the  additional  use  of tigecycline in a hospital based setting, within the small patient population of paediatric patients from 8 years  to  less  than  18  years  of  age  when  no  alternative  antibacterial  drugs  are  suitable  and  after consultation  with  a  physician  with  appropriate  experience  in  the  management  of  infectious  diseases  is expected  to  be  insignificant.  An  environmental  risk  assessment  is  not  considered  necessary  in  this application.

## 2.2.2. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

No new nonclinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  The  updated  data  submitted  in  this  application  do  not  lead  to  a  significant  increase  in environmental exposure further to the use of tigecycline. CHMP agreed that tigecycline is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetics  of  tigecycline  in  the  paediatric  population  has  been  evaluated  in  2  paediatric studies: an ascending single-dose study in subjects 8 to 16 years of age recovering from infections (study 110),  and  a  multiple-dose  study  in  patients  8  to  11  years  with  cSSTI,  cIAI,  or  community-acquired pneumonia (study 2207).  No loading dose was administered in these paediatric PK studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two  approaches  were  used  to  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetics  of  tigecycline:  an  individual  noncompartmental analysis, and a population pharmacokinetic approach.

Standard  non-compartmental  analysis  methods  were  used  to  determine  individually  the  following parameters:  Cmax,  tmax,  AUC,  t1/2,  CL,  V,  Clss  and  Vss.  Weight-normalized  clearance  (CLW)  and weight-normalized volume of distribution (VssW) were also calculated for study 2207 as the ratio of the parameter/weight.

PK parameters were calculated for all participants in study 110 and for all but 7 in study 2207.

The calculated individual parameters for study 110 are listed in the following table:

a.Dose noimalized to l mg/kg.

The estimated PK parameters when data were individually analysed by non-compartmental methods in study 2207 showed that the pharmacokinetics of tigecycline in the paediatric population differs from that in adults.

The mean Vss (3.6 and 2.84 L/kg for the 1 mg/kg and 1.25 mg/kg dosing groups, respectively) was half the value observed in adults (7.9 L/kg). Conversely, weight adjusted plasma clearance (0.50 and 0.52 L/h/kg  for  the  1  mg/kg  and  1.25  mg/kg  dosing  groups,  respectively)  was  higher  than  in  adults  (0.31 L/h/kg). These results translated in higher Cmax in children (1.5 and 2.6 mg/L for the 1 mg/kg and 1.25

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mg/kg dosing groups, respectively) than in adults (1.45 mg/L) but in lower AUC values for children (2.5 and  3.1  mg/L/h  for  the  1  mg/kg  or  1.25  mg/kg  doses  respectively)  than  in  adults  (5.19  mg/L/h  for adults).

In  study  110,  several  children  had  very  high  Cmax  values  (up  to  90  mg/L,  30  minutes  after  the administration of the dose). In study 2207 the maximum Cmax value seen was 12.9 mg/L in the highest dosing group. Such high values had not been seen in adult studies.

A  population  pharmacokinetic  model  was  developed  using  pooled  PK  data  from  the  two  PK  paediatric studies. The data were best described by a two compartmental model with first-order elimination from the central compartment. Body weight was found to be a covariate of tigecycline plasma clearance. The interindividual  variability  was  high.  The  estimated  parameters  describing  the  pharmacokinetics  of tigecycline in children are listed in the following table:

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

## PK/PD modelling

Exposure-response  analyses  of  tigecycline  in  adults  with  cSSTI  and  cIAI  previously  determined  that AUC/MIC  ratios  of  17.9  and  6.96  were  most  predictive  of  therapeutic  efficacy  in  cSSTI  and  cIAI, respectively. Thus, these ratios were selected for target attainment in simulations that compared various paediatric doses of tigecycline with the approved adult dose of 50 mg IV q12h.

Two approaches were used to simulate AUC0-24 and MIC values for comparison of target attainment and dose selection:

- Monte Carlo  simulations  using  individual  clearance  values  determined  from  non-compartmental analysis of the PK data from children aged 8 to 11 (data from study 3074K4-2207-WW) and from adults (phase 2 and 3 studies); and
- Nonlinear  mixed  effects  (NLME)  model-based  simulations  using  the  paediatric  population  PK model for children ages 8 to &lt;18 years and the population PK model for adults.

Both  approaches  used  a  range  of  weight-based  doses  in  children  from  0.75  to  1.25  mg/kg  q12h  to  a maximum dose of 50 mg q12h. In addition, a 50 mg q12h dose was simulated in children 12 to &lt;18 years of age.

a. Maximumdoseof50mgq12h

A tigecycline regimen of 1.2 mg/kg q12h, with a maximum dose of 50 mg, is predicted to achieve the target AUC/MIC ratio in a percentage of paediatric patients similar to the percentage of adults receiving 50 mg q12h.

Since the Monte Carlo simulations were performed using clearance values from younger children (8 to 11 years), model-based simulations were carried out to confirm the suitability of extrapolating the dosing based on Monte Carlo simulations to children 12 to &lt;18 years of age. Target attainment for the modelbased simulations  using  the  paediatric  population  PK  model  for  children  ages  8  to  &lt;18  years  and  the adult population PK model is presented in the following table:

For children 8 to &lt;12 years of age, doses of ≥1.0 mg/kg q12h were predicted to attain target AUC/MIC values  for  both  indications  in  a  percentage  of  paediatric  patients  similar  to  adults.  Although  all  of  the simulated doses for the 12 to &lt;18 year olds attained target in a percentage of patients comparable to adults, a plateau seemed to be reached at doses greater than 1.0 mg/kg q12h. This is consistent with a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

higher percentage of patients in this age group reaching the maximum dose of 50 mg q12h based on body weight at doses &gt;1.0 mg/kg q12h.

## 2.3.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

## Pharmacokinetics

The approved dose regimen for adults with cSSTI or cIAI is an initial loading dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours for 5 to 14 days. The AUC0-24h observed in adults is approximately 5.0 mg·h/L; thus, for AUC 0-12h, the target would be 2.5 mg·h/L. Dose reduction is considered necessary only for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C), who receive 25 mg every 12 hours following the 100 mg loading dose.

No loading dose was administered in the above paediatric PK studies. The MAH's reasoning proposal was found  acceptable  by  CHMP,  in  particular  taking  into  account  the  tolerability  issues  associated  to tigecycline administration.

Two  approaches  have  been  used  to  describe  the  pharmacokinetics  of  tigecycline:  an  individual  noncompartmental PK analysis and a population PK analysis.

The estimated PK parameters when data were individually analysed by non-compartmental methods in study 2207 showed that the pharmacokinetics of tigecycline in the paediatric population differs from that in adults. The volume of distribution in children is lower than that observed in adults, whereas clearance is higher.  These results translate in higher mean values of Cmax and smaller values of AUC for doses of 1 mg/kg or 1.25 mg/kg.

In  study  110,  several  children  had  very  high  Cmax  values  (up  to  90  mg/L,  30  minutes  after  the administration of the dose). In study 2207 the maximum Cmax value seen was 12.9 mg/L in the highest dosing group. As nausea and vomiting occur more frequently in the paediatric population and seem to be dose-dependent,  it  is  suggested  that  the  infusion  time  is  prolonged  to  60  minutes  in  the  paediatric patients. Section 4.2 of the SmPC states that Tygacil should be administered only by intravenous infusion over 30 to 60 minutes. CHMP agreed to recommend a length of infusion of 60 minutes for the paediatric population; the SmPC was updated accordingly.

Regarding the population pharmacokinetic model, a two compartmental model with weight as a covariate of  clearance best described the data, as it occurred for adults. The process followed during the model development seems reasonable although the residual error of the model was high (43.8%) and it could have  an  impact  in  the  results  of  the  simulated  individual  concentrations  used  for  percent  of  target attainment (see below).  No issues were raised in this respect given that the non-compartmental analysis of study 2207 followed by simulations was in reasonable agreement with the conclusions of the modelbased analysis.

The  effect  of  weight  on  clearance  is  sufficiently  high  as  to  suggest  that  tigecycline  should  be  dosed according to weight in children 8 to 16 years old.

During the procedure, the MAH has clarified that no data was available on tigecycline pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients with hepatic impairment.  Despite the fact that weight-adjusted tigecycline clearance is  somewhat  higher  in  children  compared  to  adults,  CHMP  agreed  that  the  excretion  pathways  are predicted  to  be  affected  to  a  similar  extent  by  severe  hepatic  impairment  in  paediatric  patients. Therefore CHMP agreed that, as in adults, a 50% reduction in tigecycline dose should be considered in children  and  adolescents  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  C).  The  SmPC  was  amended accordingly.

## Population PK-PD

The proposed dosing recommendations for tigecycline in children aged 8 to less than 18 years are as follows:

- Children aged 8 to &lt;12 years: 1.2 mg/kg every 12 hours intravenously to a maximum dose of 50 mg of tigecycline every 12 hours for 5 to 14 days.
- Adolescents aged 12 to &lt;18 years: 50 mg of tigecycline every 12 hours for 5 to 14 days.

Two approaches were used to simulate AUC0-24  and MIC values for comparison of target attainment and dose selection:

- Monte Carlo  simulations  using  individual  clearance  values  determined  from  non-compartmental analysis of the PK data from children aged 8 to 11 (data from study 2207) and from adults (phase 2 and 3 studies); and
- Nonlinear  mixed  effects  (NLME)  model-based  simulations  using  the  paediatric  population  PK model for children ages 8 to &lt;18 years and the population PK model for adults.

Both  approaches  used  a  range  of  weight-based  doses  in  children  from  0.75  to  1.25  mg/kg  q12h  to  a maximum dose of 50 mg q12h (i.e., if the bodyweight of the subject met or exceeded a 50 mg dose based upon a mg/kg dose, the dose was set to 50 mg).  In addition, a 50 mg q12h dose was simulated in children 12 to &lt;18 years of age. MIC distribution values obtained from the T.E.S.T. program during the time period from 2007 to 2009 have been used for simulations of percent of target attainment.  Both approaches are discussed given that the first one (Monte Carlo simulation) was based on results of study 2207 that enrolled only children in the age range from 8 to less than 12 years old while simulations were also  performed  for  the  older  age  range.  The  MAH  was  of  the  opinion  that  for  assessment  of  target attainment of different dosing strategies in children, Monte Carlo simulation performed as part of study 2207 was reasonable. AUC is determined by clearance alone when dosing is defined, and because weight was  the  only  covariate  found  to  significantly  influence  clearance  in  the  population  pharmacokinetic analysis,  the  2207  Monte  Carlo  simulation  explored  the  same  weight-based  dosing  possibilities  as  a simulation based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis.  In both cases the maximum dose allowed was 50 mg every 12 hours.

The distribution of body weights used for each dosing scenario in the Monte Carlo simulation was (mean ± SD) 34.8 ± 11.7 kg, based on values from children with PK in study 2207.  The weight at which the dose reached the adult maximum of 50 mg was lower as the weight-based dosing level increased; e.g. a weight of 67 kg for the lowest dose simulated (0.75 mg/kg) and 40 kg for the highest dose simulated (1.25  mg/kg).  The  distribution  of  clearance  values  used  in  the  simulation  was  (mean  ±  SD)  0.503  ± 0.293 L/h/kg, which covered the range estimated by the population pharmacokinetic analysis of 10.04 L/h for the 20 kg minimum weight (0.502 L/h/kg) to 17.49 L/h for the 120 kg maximum weight (0.146 L/h/kg).

In adult patients the following targets were identified: AUC0-24/MIC ratios of ≥ 17.9 for cSSTI and ≥ 6.96 for cIAI. The percentage of adult patients expected to meet or exceed the target AUC(0-24h)/MIC ratios is 82.4% for complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) and 57.0% for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI).

The estimated percent of target attainment in paediatric patients based on the Monte-Carlo simulation are 81.6% and 54.5% for cIAI and cSSTI, respectively for the proposed dose of 1.2 mg/kg every 12 hours. These figures for model-based simulation of the same dose are 86.5% and 62.0% for children aged 8 to less than 12 years. For children aged 12 to less than 18 years, the percent of target attainment according

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to model-based simulations for the proposed dose of 50 mg every 12 hours were 87.4% and 64.1% for cIAI and cSSTIs, respectively.

Therefore, pop-PK-PD model-based simulations of percent of target attainment lead to higher estimates of paediatric patients at or above the adult predefined target. It can be discussed whether the proposed dose of 1.2 mg/kg for children aged 8 to less than 12 years is appropriate or whether a lower dose such as 1 mg/kg may be more appropriate. In this respect the CHMP agreed with the MAH's proposal, due to the fact that tigecycline is expected to be used in serious infections in children when no other alternatives are  suitable.  As  a  consequence,  it  was  agreed  that  a  higher  dose  will  maximize  efficacy.    In  addition, safety of tigecycline can be easily monitored in clinical practice. Second, because the residual error of the pop  PK  model  was  estimated  to  be  43.3%.  Such  a  high  value  may  have  an  impact  in  model-based predictions.

In conclusion, CHMP agreed that the proposed dosing regimen of 1.2 mg/kg every 12 h for children 8 to &lt;12 years old and 50 mg every 12h for children 12 to less than 18 years old seemed reasonable. CHMP also agreed that a 50% dose reduction was equally appropriate for both adult patients and children and adolescents with severe hepatic impairment.

## 2.3.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

CHMP agreed with the proposed dosing regimen of 1.2 mg/kg every 12 h for children 8 to &lt;12 years old and  50  mg  every  12h  for  children  12  to  less  than  18  years  old.  CHMP  also  agreed  that  a  50%  dose reduction was also appropriate for children and adolescents with severe hepatic impairment.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

Tigecycline has not been fully investigated in the paediatric population for treatment of cSSTI and cIAI, pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and  safety  data  are  available  from  2  studies  in  paediatric  subjects:  single-dose study 3074A1-110-US (hereafter referred to as study 110) and multiple-dose study 3074K4-2207-WW (hereafter  referred  to  as  study  2207),  and  limited  efficacy  data  are  available  from  the  latter.  These results,  together  with  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling are used for extrapolating the efficacy of tigecycline from adults to support the approval in children 8 years of age and older for the treatment of cSSTI and cIAI.

Support for the efficacy of tigecycline in paediatric patients is provided by:

- Data  for  clinical  response  from  Study  2207,  conducted  in  58  children  8-11  years  of  age  with cSSTI, cIAI, or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP);
- Efficacy  outcomes  from  12  patients  less  than  18  years  of  age  who  received  tigecycline  on  a compassionate use basis.
- Information from the medical literature regarding efficacy outcomes in patients &lt;18 years of age treated with tigecycline; and
- Microbiology data from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST): A summary of the in vitro antibacterial activity of tigecycline against pathogens isolated from children 8 to &lt;18 years of age globally and in the EU from January 2004 to October 2014.

## 2.4.1. Dose response studies

## Efficacy of Tigecycline in Paediatric Clinical Trials (Study 3074K4-2207-WW)

This was a phase 2, multicentre, open-label, ascending multiple-dose study to determine the PK profile and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ascending multiple doses of tigecycline in paediatric subjects aged  from  8  to  11  years  with  cIAI,  cSSSI,  or  CAP  requiring  hospitalisation  and  administration  of intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. It is part of the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) agreed with the PDCO and for which a positive opinion was issued by the EMA in May 2009 (date of last modification of the agreed PIP).

Eligible  subjects  received  intravenous  (IV)  tigecycline  at  a  dosage  of  0.75,  1,  or  1.25  mg/kg  (up  to  a maximum dose of 50 mg) every 12 hours infused over approximately 30 minutes. Omitting the loading dose for the paediatric population was considered acceptable by the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) at the time  of  the  PIP  agreement,  mainly  due  to  tolerability  issues.  All  subjects  received  IV  tigecycline  for  a minimum of 3 days to a maximum of 14 consecutive days. On or after day 4, it was possible to switch to oral antibiotics (IV plus oral switch). Escalation to the next dose cohort occurred only after the following: 1) safety and tolerability data at the preceding dose through the last day of therapy (tigecycline LDOT) had been reviewed by the sponsor, 2) at least 5 of the 6 properly processed PK samples were received by the central laboratory from at least 12 subjects ('PK evaluable'), and 3) all available efficacy data were reviewed.

The objectives of this study were to determine the PK profile and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ascending multiple doses of tigecycline in subjects aged 8 to 11 years with selected serious infections (cIAI, cSSSI, CAP). Because of the descriptive nature of the study, no formal statistical analyses were planned for the efficacy data. Evaluation of efficacy data consisted primarily of summary displays (i.e., descriptive statistics) by treatment group.

The  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  consisted  of  59  subjects  who  were  screened  and  randomized  to treatment. Of these subjects, 58 subjects received at least 1 dose of tigecycline and were included in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population. The disposition of subjects by treatment group and diagnosis in the mITT population is provided in the following table:

For all  tigecycline-treated  subjects,  the  cure  rates  at  the  LDOT  were  82.4%  in  the  0.75  mg/kg  group, 52.4% in the 1 mg/kg group, and 30.0% in the 1.25 mg/kg group. At the TOC assessment, 94.1% of subjects in the 0.75 mg/kg group, 76.2% of subjects in the 1 mg/kg group, and 75.0% of subjects in the 1.25 mg/kg group were considered cured.

For  subjects  with  CAP,  the  cure  rates  at  LDOT  were  100%  in  the  0.75  mg/kg  group,  75.0%  in  the  1 mg/kg group, and 0% in the 1.25 mg/kg group. At the TOC assessment, 100% of subjects in the 0.75 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg groups were considered cured, and 75.0% of subjects in the 1.25 mg/kg group were considered cured.

For subjects with cIAI, the cure rates at LDOT were 100% in the 0.75-mg/kg group, 33.3% in the 1mg/kg group, and 50.0% in the 1.25-mg/kg group. At the TOC assessment, 100% of subjects in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

0.75-mg/kg group, 50.0% of subjects in the 1-mg/kg group, and 83.3% of subjects in the 1.25-mg/kg group were considered cured.

For subjects with cSSTI, the cure rates at LDOT were 25.0% in the 0.75-mg/kg group, 42.9% in the 1mg/kg group, and 0% in the 1.25-mg/kg group. At the TOC assessment, 75.0% of subjects in the 0.75mg/kg, 71.4% of subjects in the 1-mg/kg group, and 50.0% of subjects in the 1.25-mg/kg group were considered cured. The individual unbound exposure (fuAUC0-24h) values and clinical outcomes were used to explore a potential exposure effect. Logistic regression analysis of fuAUC0-24h versus clinical outcome failed to demonstrate a contribution of fuAUC0-24h to clinical success.

CAP=community-acquired pneumonia; CI=confidence interval; cIAI=complicated intra-abdominal infections; cSSSI=complicated skin and skin structure infections; LDOT=last day of therapy; mITT=modified intent-to-treat; TOC=test-of-cure.

a. Treatment group confidence intervals are unweighted and calculated by using the method of Clopper and Pearson.

b. No failure was observed at the LDOT visit.

Of the 4 subjects whose response was reported as failure at TOC, the clinical course of 2 suggested a lack of  efficacy:  1  had  recurrent  infection  after  incomplete  debridement  (0.75  mg/kg,  subject  2207-030000118) and 1 received a prolonged course of oral antibiotics (1.25 mg/kg, subject 2207-007-000019). The other 2 subjects whose response was reported as failure were due to protocol deviations.

A total of 7 subjects had a clinical response that was reported as 'indeterminate' (LDOT/TOC) for reasons that were unrelated to efficacy.

Taking  into  account  the  limitations  of  the  small  sample  size,  CHMP  acknowledged  that  the  observed clinical cure rates for cSSTI and cIAI in paediatric patients across the dose range were generally similar to clinical cure rates observed in adults who received the standard approved dosage regimen of tigecycline.

## Efficacy outcomes from 12 patients less than 18 years of age who received tigecycline on a compassionate use basis

During the clinical development of tigecycline, patients were treated with tigecycline on an emergency use/compassionate  use  basis  under  single  patient  INDs  or  as  named  patients.  Information  for  104  of these subjects was collected, which included data for 12 patients less than 18 years of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Eleven patients were in the 12 to 17 year age range, and one patient was approximately 3 years old. Body weight was 24 to 30 kg for 3 patients, 36 to 45 kg for 3 patients, and 15 kg for the 3 year-old patient. Weight information was not available for 5 of the patients.

Among  the  12  patients,  9  were  patients  with  cystic  fibrosis  who  had  rapidly  growing  mycobacterial infections  ( M.  abscessus or M.  chelonae ).  Among  the  remaining  3  patients,  1  had  disseminated  skin lesions  with M.  chelonae ,  1  had  a  sternal  soft  tissue  and  bone A.  baumannii infection,  and  1  had A. baumannii bacteraemia (the last was the 3 year-old patient).

Among the patients between 12 and 17 years of age, 4 patients received 25 to 80 mg tigecycline (with dosing of 25 to 40 mg once or twice daily); 3 received 50 mg twice daily, 1 received 100 mg once daily, 1 received 0.5 mg/kg twice daily, and the dose was unknown in 2 patients. The 3 year-old patient received tigecycline 40 mg x 2 (units not specified), 20 mg x 2 (units not specified), and then 0.5 mg/kg. Duration of dosing was up to 3 months in 7 patients, 3-6 months in 1 patient, 6-12 months in 1 patient, and more than 12 months in 2 patients (just over 12 months in one and approximately 19 months in the other), and of unknown duration in one patient.

Seven patients were considered to have improved, 1 was indeterminate, and the others had little or no improvement  in  their  signs/symptoms.  CHMP  agreed  that,  similar  to  adults,  the  results  of  the compassionate use of tigecycline in 11 children aged 12 to 17 years and one patient who was 3 years old suggest that tigecycline may be useful for the treatment of serious infections in children.

## Information from the medical literature regarding efficacy outcomes in patients &lt;18 years of age treated with tigecycline

A search of the medical literature to identify  publications  reporting the  use  of  tigecycline  in  paediatric patients was conducted in the biomedical literature databases. Literature reports that only investigated in vitro activity  of  tigecycline  or  antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  pathogens  isolated  from  paediatric patients and  that  did  not  include  clinical  use  or  safety  data  were  excluded.  In  addition,  literature  reports  that summarised clinical  trials  with  adult  and  paediatric  patients  were  excluded  if  paediatric  data  were  not summarised  separately.  Literature  reports  that  summarised  multiple  individual  case  reports  were excluded if the cases had already been summarised individually. Based on these criteria, a total of 14 articles that reported efficacy outcomes and/or safety information in paediatric subjects were selected. The 14 articles discussed the use of tigecycline for the treatment of a variety of infection types, with the following distribution: 2 articles concerned cIAI, and 3 concerned  cSSTI; 2 articles reported on cystic fibrosis-related infections, 3 reported leukaemia-related infections, 2 concerned central nervous system infections,  and  2  reported  on  lung  infections  treated  with  tigecycline.  CHMP  agreed  that  overall,  the information reported in these 14 publications suggests that tigecycline may be useful for the treatment of infections in paediatric patients.

## Microbiology data from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST): A summary of the in vitro antibacterial activity of tigecycline against pathogens isolated from children 8 to &lt;18 years of age globally and in the EU from January 2004 to October 2014.

Data from the TEST program have been summarised for the in vitro antibacterial activity of tigecycline and comparators against pathogens obtained from infections in paediatric patients ≥8 to &lt;18 years of age between January 2004 and October 2014.

Isolates were recovered from clinical infections from both community- and hospital associated sources. In all  cases,  only  one  isolate  per  patient  was  allowed.  The  minimum  inhibitory  concentrations  (MICs)  of tigecycline  and  the  comparators  were  determined  by  broth  microdilution  (aerobes)  and  agar  dilution (anaerobes)  according  to  methodologies  and  guidelines  approved  by  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the European Committee  on  Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST).

The general report (adults and children) includes data for 10,142 isolates collected globally from 1,907 study centres in 66 countries; these included 4,090 European isolates from 903 sites in 26 countries.

Summaries are provided for isolates obtained from global sources and from European populations; and data are summarised for isolates from all indications, as well as isolates from intra-abdominal and skin and skin structure sources.

Tigecycline  showed in  vitro activity  against  a  broad  spectrum  of  Gram-negative  and  Gram-positive species including many with common resistant phenotypes such as ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter species, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae .

Global and European data demonstrated the same tigecycline in vitro activity, with inhibition of 100% of the S. aureus (n=1,902) and 99.8% of the enterococci (n=447) in the global collection at their respective breakpoints without regard to methicillinor vancomycin-resistant phenotypes. Activity against Enterobacteriaceae (n=3,373) from the global population was high, with 98% of all isolates and 97.9% of all  extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing isolates (n=290) tested in this study inhibited at the current FDA susceptibility breakpoint of 2 mg/L. European data showed 92.5% of all Enterobacteriaceae (n=1,154) and 86.0% of all ESBLs (n=121) inhibited at the EUCAST breakpoint of 1 mg/L.

Tigecycline was also active against Acinetobacter spp. (n=560), including A. baumannii and A. lwoffii , and Stenotrophomonas  maltophilia (n=32),  with  MIC90  values  of  1  mg/L,  although  it  had  limited  activity against Pseudomonas  aeruginosa .  Tigecycline  showed  MIC90  values  of  2  and  1  mg/L,  respectively, against gram-negative anaerobes Bacteroides spp. (n=97) and Prevotella spp. (n=44), and had activity against the gram-positive anaerobes Clostridium spp. (n=24), Parvimonas micra (n=14), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n=13), with MIC90 values of 0.12, ≤0.06, and 0.12 mg/L, respectively.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

PK and safety data are available from two PK studies in paediatric subjects: single-dose study 110 and multiple-dose  study  2207  (which  included  descriptive  efficacy  data).  Study  2207  was  submitted  in accordance with article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, as amended. As the study was primarily a PK study and at that time two paediatric safety and efficacy studies were planned, limited analysis of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

efficacy  and  safety  was  done.  In  addition,  the  MAH  has  submitted  data  from  children  who  received tigecycline in the setting of compassionate use (12 patients), paediatric use reported in the literature (14 articles reporting efficacy and/or safety in a total of 33 patients aged &lt;18 years). Finally, a summary of the microbiology data from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) of pathogens isolated from children 8 to &lt;18 years of age has been submitted.

## Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy

Efficacy results from study 2207 are provided descriptively. Clinical cure at TOC is higher for the lower dose (0.75 mg/kg) than for the highest doses. However, the limited number of patients and the lack of standardisation  regarding  concomitant  antibiotic  therapy  (other  than  tigecycline)  may  have  influenced (among others) the results and do not permit to draw appropriate conclusions.

For subjects with cIAI, the cure rates at LDOT were 100% in the 0.75-mg/kg group, 33.3% in the 1mg/kg group, and 50.0% in the 1.25-mg/kg group. At the TOC assessment, 100% of subjects in the 0.75-mg/kg group, 50.0% of subjects in the 1-mg/kg group, and 83.3% of subjects in the 1.25-mg/kg group were considered cured.

For subjects with cSSTI, the cure rates at LDOT were 25.0% in the 0.75-mg/kg group, 42.9% in the 1mg/kg group, and 0% in the 1.25-mg/kg group. At the TOC assessment, 75.0% of subjects in the 0.75mg/kg, 71.4% of subjects in the 1-mg/kg group, and 50.0% of subjects in the 1.25-mg/kg group were considered cured.

Among children who received tigecycline on a compassionate use basis, 9 out of 12 were patients with cystic fibrosis. Among the remaining 3 patients, 1 had disseminated skin lesions, 1 had a soft tissue and bone infection, and 1 had A. baumannii bacteraemia. Eleven cases are children aged 12 years and older; one case treated with tigecycline was 3 years old. After tigecycline therapy, 7 of the 12 patients were considered  to  have  improved,  in  one  patient  the  outcome  was  indeterminate,  and  the  remaining  4 patients had little or no improvement in their signs/symptoms.

Based on the data presented by the MAH concerning the compassionate use and use reported on the literature,  it  appears  that  most  of  the  paediatric  use  is  outside  of  the  approved  indications  in  adults (bacteraemia, cystic fibrosis, meningitis, pneumonia) and across all paediatric age subsets (the youngest 2.5  months  old).  The  outcomes  differ  according  to  the  indication  in  which  tigecycline  is  used  but  are indicative that tigecycline has the potential for treating serious infections where other alternatives are not available or have failed. The review of these data also shows that tigecycline is usually administered in combination with other antibiotics.

Data  from  the  ongoing  TEST  surveillance  program  from  patients  in  the  age  range  of  the  proposed paediatric indications show no major differences among all indications, and specifically isolates from intraabdominal and skin and skin structure sources. Tigecycline also showed in vitro activity against a broad spectrum  of  gram  negative  and  gram-positive  resistant  bacteria  such  as  ESBL-producing E.  coli and Klebsiella spp,  multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp,  methicillin-resistant S.aureus  and vancomycinresistant enterococci.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Overall, the efficacy of tigecycline has not been fully investigated in the paediatric population. Mainly the PK/PD modelling is used for extrapolating the efficacy of tigecycline from adults to support the approval in children aged 8 to less than 18 years for the treatment of cSSTI and cIAI with limited therapeutic options.

According  to  the  'Addendum  to  the  guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  medicinal  products  indicated  for treatment of  bacterial  infections',  limited  evidence  of  clinical  safety  and  efficacy  could  be  accepted  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

support  an  approval  for  the  treatment  of  infections  caused  by  MDR  organism  for  which  there  are  few therapeutic  options.  Considering  that  the  use  of  tygecicline  will  be  limited  to  the  treatment  of  serious infections caused by multidrug resistant microorganisms to available alternatives, CHMP considered that the limited evidence submitted, together with the microbiological data presented and the extrapolation approach  based  on  PK/PD  modelling  were  sufficient  to  support  such  a  restricted  paediatric  indication, given that the microorganisms involved in these infections are similar in both the adult and the paediatric populations.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

While tigecycline has not been fully investigated in the paediatric population for treatment of cSSTI and cIAI,  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and  safety  data  are  available  from  2  clinical  pharmacology  studies  in paediatric subjects:

- Study 3074A1-110-US: single-dose study in 25 children 8 to 16 years of age; and
- Study 3074K4-2207-WW: multiple-dose study in 58 children 8 to 11 years of age.

Information  supporting  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  tigecycline  in  children  &lt;18  years  of  age  is  also derived from 12 subjects &lt;18 years of age who were treated on a compassionate use basis and were included in a summary report of compassionate use experience.

Safety information is  also  available  from  cases  for  children  &lt;18  years  of  age  that  are  reported  in  the MAH's safety database.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, the number of treatment doses received was generally similar across treatment groups. Subjects in  the  1.25-mg/kg  group  received  fewer  doses  of  tigecycline  than  subjects  in  the  0.75-mg/kg  and  1mg/kg groups, but the overall difference was not statistically significant (p=0.209). Subjects received a mean  of  13.0  doses  of  tigecycline  in  the  0.75-mg/kg  treatment  group,  12.6  doses  in  the  1-mg/kg treatment group, and 9.8 doses in the 1.25-mg/kg group.

A  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  1-mg/kg  (28.6%)  and  1.25-mg/kg  (55.0%)  treatment  groups switched to oral antibiotic therapy compared with subjects in the 0.75-mg/kg treatment group (17.7%) but  the  difference  was  not  statistically  significant  (p=0.060).  For  subjects  who  were  switched  to  oral antibiotic therapy, the mean duration of therapy was 5.7 days in the 0.75-mg/kg treatment group, 7.7 days in the 1-mg/kg treatment group, and 4.2 days in the 1.25-mg/kg treatment group (p=0.185). All but 1 subject in the mITT population (98.3%) received at least 80% and not more than 120% of the expected dosage of tigecycline.

## Compassionate use

In addition, 12 subjects &lt;18 years of age received various doses of tigecycline on a compassionate use basis. Among the patients between 12 and 17 years of age, 4 patients received 25 to 80 mg tigecycline (with dosing of 25 to 40 mg once or twice daily); 3 received 50 mg twice daily, 1 received 100 mg once daily, 1 received 0.5 mg/kg twice daily, and the dose was unknown in 2 patients. The 3 year-old patient received tigecycline 40 mg x 2 (units not specified), 20 mg x 2 (units not specified), and then 0.5 mg/kg. Duration of dosing was up to 3 months in 7 patients, 3-6 months in 1 patient, 6-12 months in 1 patient, and more than 12 months in 2 patients (just over 12 months in one and approximately 19 months in the other), and of unknown duration in one patient.

## Adverse events

Study  110 -  Among  the  25  subjects  who  received  a  single  administration  of  tigecycline  and  were included in the safety analysis, 8 subjects (32%) had TEAEs. The most frequent AEs were vomiting (4 subjects,  16%),  nausea  (3  subjects,  12%),  and  headache  (2  subjects,  8%),  with  the  nausea  and vomiting occurring in the higher dose groups (1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg), but not in children who received 0.5  mg/kg.  Three  subjects  in  the  higher  dose  groups  (1  mg/kg  and  2  mg/kg)  had  both  nausea  and vomiting, which were considered to be mild in 2 subjects and moderate in one subject. One subject in the 1  mg/kg  group  had  severe  vomiting  and  associated  dehydration  (moderate),  for  which  he  was hospitalised.  While  one  child  who  had  very  high  serum  concentrations  of  tigecycline  (as  measured  by area-under-the concentration-time curve [AUC]) experienced nausea and/or vomiting, the AUC values for children who experienced nausea and/or vomiting usually fell within the range of AUC values for children who did not experience nausea and/or vomiting.

Study 2207 - Among the 58 subjects who received at least 1 dose of tigecycline, 44 subjects (75.9%) experienced  one  or  more  treatment-emergent-adverse-events  (TEAEs).  The  most  frequently  reported TEAEs  were  related  to  the  gastrointestinal  system.  The  most  frequently  occurring  TEAEs  overall  were nausea and vomiting. Nausea was reported in significantly higher percentages of subjects in the 1.25mg/kg  group  (60.0%)  and  1.0-mg/kg  group  (61.9%)  compared  with  the  0.75-mg/kg  group  (17.6%) (p=0.018 and p=0.009, respectively).

The majority of nausea and vomiting events were reported as mild to moderate in severity (grades 1 or 2). Two (2) subjects with cIAI receiving 1.25 mg/kg of tigecycline had TEAEs of vomiting with grade 3 toxicity.  The  investigators  assessed  the  TEAEs  as  related  to  treatment  in  1  subject  and  not  related  to treatment in the other subject.

In the System Organ Class (SOC) 'Investigations' 15 (25.9%) subjects reported some adverse events. In the  SOC  Infections  and  Infestations,  9  (15.5%)  subjects  reported  the  following  adverse  events:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

candidiasis  (a  subject  in  the  0.75-mg/kg  dosing  group),  oral  candidiasis  (a  subject  in  the  1.25-mg/kg dosing  group),  post  procedural  infection  (a  subject  in  the  0.75-mg/kg  dosing  group),  postoperative wound infection (2 patients in the 0.75-mg/kg dosing group), superinfection (a subject in the 0.75-mg/kg dosing group), Tinea capitis (a subject in the 1-mg/kg dosing group) and viral upper respiratory infection (a subject in the 0.75-mg/kg dosing group). Two (3.4%) subjects reported convulsions in the 1-mg/kg dosing group. A subject (1.7%) reported dysgeusia and other headache (1.7%).

Nausea and vomiting were considered treatment-related in most cases, i.e. in 22/58 (37.9%) of patients and in 19/58 (32.8%) of patients respectively. This was also the case of anorexia, dysgeusia and pruritus that were reported by a single subject each. Lab abnormalities were considered treatment-related for 7 patients (12.1%) as follows:

Seven (12.1%) of these patients reported adverse events that were considered drug-related as follows:

- -Activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  prolonged:  1  (1.7%)  subject,  in  the  1.25-  mg/kg  dosing groups.
- -Alanine  aminotransferase  increased:  2  (3.4%)  subjects,  one  on  0.75  mg/kg  and  other  on  1 mg/kg.
- -Bilirubin conjugated increased: 1 (1.7%) subject in the 1.25-mg/kg dosing group.
- -Blood amylase increased: 2 (3.4%) subjects (1 on 0.75 mg/kg and 1 on 1.25 mg/kg).
- -Blood bilirubin increased: 1 (1.7%) subject in the 1.25-mg/kg dosing group.
- -Blood phosphorus increased: 1 (1.7%) subject in the 1.25-mg/kg dosing group.
- -Electrocardiogram QT prolonged: 1 (1.7%) subject in the 1-mg/kg dosing group.
- -International normalised ratio increased: 1 (1.7%) subject in the 1.25-mg/kg dosing group.
- -Lipase increased: 2 (3.4) subjects in 1.25-mg/kg dosing group.
- -Platelet count increased: 1 (1.7%) in the 1.25-mg/kg dosing group.
- -Prothrombin time prolonged: 1 (1.7%) in the 1.25-mg/kg dosing group.

Compassionate  Use -  Among  the  12  subjects  &lt;18  years  of  age  who  received  tigecycline  on  a compassionate  use  basis,  10  (83.3%)  were  reported  to  have  experienced  1  or  more  AEs.  The  most frequently  reported  AEs  were  related  to  the  digestive  system:  nausea  was  reported  for  8  subjects (66.7%), and vomiting was reported for 5 subjects (41.7%).

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

No deaths occurred during study 110 or study 2207, and none of the 12 paediatric patients died during compassionate use treatment.

## Other Serious Adverse Events

Study 110 - One subject (4.0%) experienced an SAE of vomiting associated with dehydration. This 11year-old male subject in the 1.0 mg/kg group was hospitalised for treatment, and the events resolved. The vomiting was considered to be severe, and dehydration was considered to be moderate in severity. Both events were considered to be definitely related to tigecycline.

Study 2207 - SAEs were reported for 3 subjects (5.2%). One subject with cIAI receiving 0.75 mg/kg of tigecycline had an SAE of postoperative wound infection. Two subjects with cSSTI had SAEs: 1 subject in the 1.0 mg/kg group had an SAE of anal fistula and 1 subject in the 1.25 mg/kg group had an SAE of abdominal pain.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Laboratory findings

Study 110 - Four subjects had abnormal laboratory values of potential clinical importance, including low phosphorus, high blood urea nitrogen, low neutrophils, and high eosinophils. These abnormal values were considered not clinically important by the medical monitor.

## Study 2207

Overall, 45 of 57 (78.9%) subjects had 1 or more potentially clinically important (PCI) laboratory test results  while  on  therapy.  Decreased  sodium  was  reported  for  5.9%  of  subjects  in  the  0.75  mg/kg treatment group, 23.8% of subjects in the 1.0 mg/kg treatment group, and in no subjects in the 1.25 mg/kg  treatment  group.  This  finding,  while  statistically  significant  (p=0.031),  did  not  correlate  with increasing doses of tigecycline and was not believed to be clinically significant.

The most frequently occurring PCI results while on therapy were high platelet count, occurring in 21 of 57 (36.8%) subjects, and low or decreased albumin, occurring in 15 of 48 (31.3%) subjects in the mITT population.

## Electrocardiograms

In study 2207, ECG recordings were read and interpreted at the investigative site and were then sent to a central laboratory. Corrected QT (QTc) intervals were calculated using the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Overall, no meaningful differences were noted among the treatment groups in the incidence of PCI ECG results.

## Safety in special populations

The number of subjects &lt;18 years of age who received tigecycline in the 2 clinical pharmacology studies was  too  small  to  permit  a  meaningful  assessment  of  the  effect  of  intrinsic  factors  on  the  safety  of tigecycline.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No  studies  were  conducted  in  paediatric  subjects  regarding  the  potential  of  drug-drug  or  drug-food interactions.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Study 110 One subject was withdrawn from the study because of an adverse event. A 12-year-old male subject in the 2.0 mg/kg group had an injection site reaction (infiltration at the IV site) and was withdrawn from the study. This AE was considered mild in severity and not related to tigecycline.

Study 2207 - Two subjects (3.4%) discontinued tigecycline and were withdrawn from the study because of adverse events. One subject in the 1 mg/kg group discontinued tigecycline because of an AE of lipase increased, and was withdrawn from the study because of AEs of pancreatitis, blood amylase increased, and lipase increased. One subject in the 1.25 mg/kg group discontinued tigecycline because of an AE of blood amylase increased and was withdrawn from the study because of an AE of lipase increased.

## Post marketing experience

As of 30 September 2014, 64 paediatric cases (&lt;18 years of age), including 125 AEs, have been received worldwide  by  the  sponsor;  these  include  54  spontaneous  reports  and  10  literature  reports.  These  64 cases  do  not  include  SAE  reports  in  the  safety  database  that  are  derived  from  clinical  studies  or compassionate  use,  which  have  already  been  discussed.  Of  the  64  total  reported  cases,  21  patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(32.8%) were female, 27 (42.2%) were male, and for 16 (25.0%) the gender was not reported or was unknown. For the 56 cases in which age was reported, the minimum age was preterm infant and the maximum age was 17 years (mean of 10.3 years, median of 12.0 years). The cases were mostly from the United Kingdom (10; 15.6%), United States (10; 15.6%), France (6; 9.4%), Germany (4; 6.3%), Israel (4; 6.3%), Russian Federation (4; 6.3%), China (3; 4.7%) and Greece (3; 4.7%), with 2 cases (3.1%) each from Croatia, Finland, Italy,  South  Korea,  South  Africa,  Sweden,  and  Turkey.  Case  outcome  was reported as fatal in 6 cases (9.4%), not recovered/not resolved in 6 (9.4%), recovered/resolved in 20 (31.3%), recovering/resolving in 2 (3.1%) and unknown in 30 (46.9%). Twenty-five (25; 39.1%) of the cases were serious and 39 (60.9%) non serious.

The  majority  of  the  reported  indications  would  be  considered  off-label  use  based  on  approved  adult indications.

Adverse events were summarised using MedDRA (version 17.0). Among the 64 paediatric cases, the most frequently reported adverse events (Preferred Terms) were off-label use (19 cases; 29.7%), vomiting (10 cases; 15.6%), nausea (9 cases; 14.1%), oedematous pancreatic /pancreatitis/pancreatitis acute (1/3/3 cases  respectively;  total  11.0%),  and  sepsis  (4  cases;  6.3%).  Seven  cases  (11.0%)  reported  a  term consistent  with  elevated  hepatic  transaminases  (i.e.  alanine  aminotransferase  increased,  aspartate aminotransferase  increased,  hepatic  enzymes  increased,  transaminases  increased).  Of  the  19  cases reporting off-label use as an adverse event, 11 cases reported no additional AE and 8 cases reported an AE in addition  to  off-label  use.  While  only  some  of  the  cases  were  coded  to  off-label  use,  all  of  these cases are off-label use, based on the current lack of an approved indication in paediatric patients.

## Post-Authorisation Safety Study (Study B1811184)

Study  B1811184  was  a  non-interventional,  retrospective,  chart  abstraction,  post-authorisation  safety study,  conducted  in  the  EU  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  the  risk  minimisation  measures  (RMM) implemented for the newly identified risk of superinfection, and the safety concerns of potential for offlabel  use  and  potential  for  lack  of  efficacy  (Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  update,  Direct  to Healthcare  Professional  Communication,  and  a  healthcare  provider  educational  program).  The  study described indications for tigecycline use and clinical outcomes among adult patients with cIAI or cSSTI treated with approved doses of tigecycline in the EU before and after implementation of the RMM. As one of  the  objectives  of  the  study  was  to  investigate  off-label  use  of  tigecycline,  any  cases  describing paediatric patients were included. Out of a total of 777 subjects included in the study, 7 patients younger than 18 years of age at hospital admission were identified; 2 were treated before the RMM and 5 after the RMM. The paediatric patients ranged in age from 12 to 17 years.

Indications  for  tigecycline  use  in  the  paediatric  patients  included  one  cIAI  (intestinal  perforation),  two cSSTI (wound infection, chronic mycobacterium abscess infection) and 4 other indications (bacteraemia, exacerbation of cystic fibrosis, cystic fibrosis with Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas colonisation, and infective  exacerbation  of  bronchiectasis).  AEs  with  explicit  attribution  ('related')  to  any  Pfizer  medicine that were documented in the charts for abstraction had to be reported. None of the paediatric subjects had an AE reported, and all 7 patients were discharged alive.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

## Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety

The  main  set  of  data  contributing  to  the  assessment  of  the  safety  of  tigecycline  in  the  paediatric population derived from the multiple-dose PK study 2207. These are the results highlighted below. Useful information can also be derived from the single-dose study 110 and from data on the compassionate use of tigecycline in 12 adolescents. Additional data are discussed for 64 subjects under 18 years of age that

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

are reported in the MAH's safety database (post-marketing). In study 2207, 44/58 (75.9%) subjects were reported  with  1  or  more  treatment-emergent-adverse  events  (TEAEs).  The  most  frequently  occurring TEAEs overall were nausea and vomiting, with higher percentages of subjects in the 1.25-mg/kg group (65.0%) and 1-mg/kg group (61.9%) reporting events of nausea compared with the 0.75-mg/kg group (17.6% each). Similarly, higher rates of vomiting were noted in subjects receiving 1 mg/kg (52.4%) or 1.25 mg/kg (55.0%) of tigecycline compared with subjects receiving 0.75 mg/kg (29.4%) of tigecycline, The majority of nausea and vomiting events were reported as mild to moderate in toxicity (grades 1 or 2). Two (2) TEAEs of vomiting in subjects with complicated intra-abdominal infection were reported as grade 3 toxicity.

Nausea and vomiting were considered treatment-related in most cases, i.e. in 22/58 (37.9%) of patients and in 19/58 (32.8%) of patients respectively. This was also the case of anorexia, dysgeusia and pruritus that were reported by a single subject each. Lab abnormalities were considered treatment-related for 7 patients (12.1%).

Three (3, 5.2%) subjects had serious adverse events (SAEs) during the study. One (1; 4.2%) subject with  cIAI  receiving  0.75  mg/kg  of  tigecycline  had  an  SAE  of  postoperative  wound  infection.  Two  (2; 13.3%) subjects with cSSSI had SAEs: 1 subject in the 1-mg/kg group had an SAE of anal fistula and 1 subject in the 1.25-mg/kg group had an SAE of abdominal pain.

Two (2, 3.4%) subjects discontinued tigecycline because of adverse events (AEs). Among subjects with cIAI, 1 subject in the 1-mg/kg group discontinued tigecycline because of an AE of lipase increased, and 1 subject in the 1.25-mg/kg group discontinued tigecycline because of an AE of blood amylase increased.

Although it is stated that in most instances no significant differences among treatment groups exist, the data suggest that indeed the incidence of adverse events is dose-dependent when the two dosing groups of 1-mg/kg and 1.25-mg/kg are compared to the 0.75-mg/kg dosing group. In particular, for nausea and vomiting an analysis was performed showing that there is an overlap in AUC values between patients having nausea or vomiting or both and those who had not such adverse events. However, Cmax (rather than AUC) may be most relevant in this respect. As part of the assessment of study 2207 in accordance with  article  46  of  the  paediatric  regulation  it  was  clarified  that  Cmax  was  the  highest  concentration observed of those collected from individual patients, regardless of the time of the collection. The study design called  for  an  infusion  over  approximately  30  minutes  but  the  end of  the  infusion  time  was  not collected as part of the study. Although it cannot be clearly ascertained whether there is a relationship between  higher  Cmax  and  shorter  times  of  infusion  or  between  higher  Cmax  and  higher  incidence  of nausea and/or vomiting it should be considered, as a precaution, whether a warning should be included in section 4.2 or 4.4 recommending a 60-minute length of infusion for children, in particular for children presenting  with  nausea  and/or  vomiting  since  the  infusion  rate  is  not  expected  to  modify  the  total exposure to tigecycline.

The MAH concluded that no new or unexpected safety concerns were observed with tigecycline in the patient  population  of  study  2207.  The  CHMP  agreed  with  this  conclusion.  The  AEs  reported  in  the spontaneous and literature cases from paediatric patients are generally consistent with identified adverse reactions reported in adult patients and included in section 4.8 of the approved SmPC of Tygacil.

Regarding the information to be provided in section 4.8, the SmPC guideline states (in relation to the paediatric population) that 'any clinically relevant differences (i.e. in nature, frequency, seriousness or reversibility of adverse reactions) between the safety profiles in adult and paediatric populations, or in any relevant age groups, should be described and presented by age group. If there is a need for specific monitoring,  this  should  be  highlighted  by  cross-referencing  to  section  4.4.  For  clinically  relevant differences, a separate table listing such adverse reactions by frequency can be added and presented by relevant age groups if appropriate.'

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

SmPC section 4.8 has been amended by the MAH to provide the frequency of nausea and vomiting. This is  endorsed, as it appears that these adverse reactions are more frequent in the paediatric population than  in  adults.  For  the  remaining  adverse  reactions  listed  in  section  4.8  for  adults,  in  order  to  clarify whether this was or was not the case, the MAH provided a comparative table showing the frequency of adverse  events  for  which  the  relationship  to  tigecycline  could  not  be  excluded  between  adult  patients included in the pivotal studies in cIAI and cSSTI and children included in study 2207 (as three doses have been used the frequencies corresponding to the worst case should be used). Based on the provided data, the final MAH proposal was to additionally include in section 4.8 lipase elevation. This was agreed by the CHMP.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The use of tigecycline is expected to be limited to children for whom no alternative antibacterial drugs are available. Overall, from a safety perspective, no new safety signals have arisen. Section 4.8 of the SmPC was  updated  to  include  nausea,  vomiting  and  lipase  elevation,  which  have  different  frequencies  of appearance in adults and children.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC considered that the risk management plan could be acceptable if the applicant implements the changes to the RMP as described in the PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report.

The applicant implemented the changes in the RMP as requested by PRAC. Two minor revisions are required with the next RMP update:

- Paediatric studies 3074A1-110-US (B1811108) and 3074K4-2207-WW (B1811001) should also be included in the table of Completed Studies /Activities from the Pharmacovigilance Plan.
- According to the GVP Module V- RMP part VII (Annexes to the risk management), the RMP should contain the annexes in part VII. Therefore the annexes should be included in part VII of the RMP as part of the document.

The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 12.1 with the following content:

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

The MAH submitted an extension of indication application for the restricted use of Tygacil (tigecycline) in paediatric patients ≥8 years to &lt;18 years of age. The proposed indications for tigecycline in children are the  same  as  those  approved  for  adult  patients.  This  proposal  is  mainly  based  on  two  PK  paediatric studies.  In addition, the MAH has submitted data from children who received tigecycline in the setting of compassionate  use  (12  patients),  and  paediatric  use  reported  on  the  literature  (14  articles  reporting efficacy and/or safety in a total of 33 patients aged &lt;18 years). Finally, a summary of the microbiology data from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) of pathogens isolated from children 8 to &lt;18 years of age has been submitted.

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The  efficacy  of  tigecycline  has  not  been  fully  investigated  in  the  paediatric  population.  Mainly  PK/PD modelling  is  used  for  extrapolating  the  efficacy  of  tigecycline  from  adults  to  support  the  approval  in children (aged 8 to &lt;18 years).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

When data were individually analysed by non-compartmental methods in study 2207, the estimated PK parameters  showed that  the  pharmacokinetics  of  tigecycline  in  the  paediatric  population  differed  from that in adults. The mean Vss was half the value observed in adults. Conversely, weight adjusted plasma clearance was higher than in adults. These results translated in higher Cmax in children than in adults but in lower AUC values for children than in adults for doses of 1 or 1.25 mg/kg.

The AUC0-24h observed in adults at the approved dose is approximately 5.0 mg·h/L; thus, for AUC 012h, the target would be 2.5 mg·h/L. The value of the AUC(0-24)/MIC ratios that have been identified in adult  patients  are  ≥17.9  for  cSSTI  and  ≥6.96  for  cIAI.  For  cSSTI,  the  target  attainment  in  adults receiving the approved tigecycline dosing regimen of 100 mg followed by 50 mg q12h was estimated at 57.0% of patients while for cIAI the percent of attainment was 82.4% of patients. The estimated percent of  target  attainment for children aged 8 to less than 18 years based on the Monte-Carlo simulation is 81.6% for complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) and 54.5% for complicated skin and soft tissue infections  (cSSTI) for the proposed dose of 1.2 mg/kg every 12 hours. These figures for model-based simulation of the same dose are 86.5% and 62.0% for children aged 8 to less than 12 years. For children aged 12 to less than 18 years, the percent of target attainment according to model-based simulations for the proposed dose of 50 mg every 12 hours were 87.4% and 64.1% for cIAI and cSSTIs, respectively. The  pop-PK-PD  model-based  simulations  of  percent  of  target  attainment  lead  to  higher  estimates  of paediatric patients at or above the adult predefined target.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The main uncertainty is the lack of robust evidence of efficacy while the current application is supported by PK/PD and safety data to extrapolate from adults to children. Given the safety profile of tigecycline and the expected restricted use in clinical  practice  in  situations  where  no  other  treatment  options  are available, CHMP agreed that this was sufficient.

Regarding the population pharmacokinetic model, a two compartmental model with weight as a covariate of  clearance  best  described  the  data,  as  it  occurred  for  adults.  The  process  followed  during  model development seems reasonable although the residual error  of  the  model  was  high  (43.8%)  and  could have  an  impact  in  the  results  of  the  simulated  individual  concentrations  used  for  percent  of  target attainment.

The  pop-PK-PD  model-based  simulations  of  percent  of  target  attainment  lead  to  higher  estimates  of paediatric patients at or above the adult predefined target. It could be discussed whether the proposed dose of 1.2 mg/kg for children aged 8 to less than 12 years is appropriate or whether a lower dose such as 1 mg/kg may be more appropriate. CHMP nevertheless agreed with the MAH's proposed dose, due to the fact that tigecycline is expected to be used for the treatment of serious infections in children when no other alternatives can be used.

Only descriptive efficacy data from PK studies as well as from compassionate use and literature reports have been provided. The low number of patients and the lack of standardisation regarding concomitant antibiotic therapy (other than tigecycline) may have influenced the results (among others) and drawing conclusions from the PK studies had some limitations. Data from clinical practice use were also of little support  for  the  claimed  indications,  but  CHMP  agreed  that  they  were  suggestive  of  the  fact  that tigecycline has the potential for treating serious infections where other alternatives are not available or have  failed.  In  the  absence  of  formal  clinical  studies,  the  magnitude  of  the  benefit  in  the  claimed indications could however not be fully elucidated.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The  main  set  of  data  contributing  to  the  assessment  of  the  safety  of  tigecycline  in  the  paediatric population derived from the multiple-dose PK study 2207.

In  study  2207,  44/58  (75.9%)  subjects  were  reported  with  1  or  more  treatment-emergent-adverse events  (TEAEs).  The  most  frequently  occurring  TEAEs  overall  were  nausea  and  vomiting,  with  higher percentages of subjects in the 1.25-mg/kg group (65.0%) and 1-mg/kg group (61.9%) reporting events of nausea compared with the 0.75-mg/kg group (17.6% each). Similarly, higher rates of vomiting were noted  in  subjects  receiving  1  mg/kg  (52.4%)  or  1.25  mg/kg  (55.0%)  of  tigecycline  compared  with subjects receiving 0.75 mg/kg (29.4%) of tigecycline, The majority of nausea and vomiting events were reported  as  mild  to  moderate  in  toxicity  (grades  1  or  2).  Two  (2)  TEAEs  of  vomiting  in  subjects  with complicated intra-abdominal infection were reported as grade 3 toxicity.

Nausea and vomiting were considered treatment-related in most cases, i.e. in 22/58 (37.9%) of patients and in 19/58 (32.8%) of patients respectively. This was also the case of anorexia, dysgeusia and pruritus that were reported by a single subject each. Lab abnormalities were considered treatment-related for 7 patients (12.1%).

Three (3, 5.2%) subjects had serious adverse events (SAEs) during the study. One (1; 4.2%) subject with  cIAI  receiving  0.75  mg/kg  of  tigecycline  had  an  SAE  of  postoperative  wound  infection.  Two  (2; 13.3%) subjects with cSSSI had SAEs: 1 subject in the 1-mg/kg group had an SAE of anal fistula and 1 subject in the 1.25-mg/kg group had an SAE of abdominal pain.

Two (2, 3.4%) subjects discontinued tigecycline because of adverse events (AEs). Among subjects with cIAI, 1 subject in the 1-mg/kg group discontinued tigecycline because of an AE of lipase increased, and 1 subject in the 1.25-mg/kg group discontinued tigecycline because of an AE of blood amylase increased.

No new or unexpected safety concerns were observed with tigecycline in the patient population of study 2207. The AEs reported in these spontaneous and literature cases from paediatric patients were generally consistent with the identified adverse reactions reported in adult patients and were included in section 4.8 of the Tygacil SmPC.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The main uncertainties are based on the overall limited paediatric safety database. However, given the current restricted use in adults and the limited use expected in children restricted to patients with serious infectious were no other treatment alternatives are available, CHMP agreed that this would be considered acceptable.

Data suggest that the incidence of adverse events is dose-dependent when the two dosing groups of 1mg/kg and 1.25-mg/kg are  compared to  the 0.75-mg/kg  dosing  group.  As  part  of  the  assessment  of study 2207 in accordance with article 46 of the paediatric regulation it was clarified that Cmax was the highest concentration observed of those collected from individual patients, regardless of the time of the collection.  The  study  design  called  for  an  infusion  over  approximately  30  minutes  but  the  end  of  the infusion time was not collected as part of the study. Although it could not be clearly ascertained whether there was a relationship between the higher Cmax and shorter times of infusion or between higher Cmax and  higher  incidence  of  nausea  and/or  vomiting,  CHMP  agreed  to  include  an  appropriate  wording  in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the Tygacil SmPC, recommending a 60-minute length of infusion for children, in particular for children presenting with nausea and/or vomiting since the infusion rate is not expected to modify the total exposure to tigecycline.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

Tigecycline  is  a  semisynthetic  derivative  of  minocycline  with  a  broad  spectrum  of  antibacterial  activity that includes microorganisms that are resistant to other more commonly used antibiotics. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and  the Proteeae (Proteus  species  and  related  organisms)  are  exceptions  to  this  broadspectrum activity of tigecycline. In addition, some species such as Bacteroides fragilis and Acinetobacter baumannii show a wide distribution of susceptibilities to tigecycline.

Tygacil (tigecycline) is indicated in adults for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI), excluding diabetic foot infections, and for complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) only in situations  where  it  is  known  or  suspected  that  other  alternatives  are  not  suitable.  This  restricted indication was the consequence of a re-assessment of the benefit-risk profile of Tygacil during the 2011 renewal of the product.

The MAH submitted an extension of indication for the restricted use of Tygacil in paediatric patients ≥8 years to &lt;18 years of age. The proposed indications for tigecycline in children are the same as those approved for adult patients. Similarly to adults, the labelling will specify that tigecycline is only to be used in children when no alternative antibacterial drugs are suitable. The submission is mainly based on two PK paediatric  studies:  an  ascending  single-dose  study  in  subjects  8  to  16  years  of  age  recovering  from infections  (Study  110),  and  a  multiple-dose  study  in  patients  8  to  11  years  with  cSSTI,  cIAI,  or community-acquired pneumonia (Study 2207).  In addition, the MAH has submitted data from children who received tigecycline in the setting of compassionate use (12 patients), and paediatric use reported on the  literature  (14  articles  reporting  efficacy  and/or  safety  in  a  total  of  33  patients  aged  &lt;18  years). Finally, a summary of the microbiology data from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) of pathogens isolated from children 8 to &lt;18 years of age has been submitted.

The  use  of  tigecycline  in  children  younger  than  8  years  old  may  be  associated  with  permanent  tooth discolouration if used during tooth development and a waiver was granted for studies in children &lt;8 years of age in December 2008. Nevertheless tigecycline may constitute the only alternative for children with infections produced by multi-resistant (mainly Gram-negative) microorganisms, and during this procedure CHMP assessed the appropriateness of granting a last line indication in children and whether of dosing recommendations for children aged 8 to 18 years could be made.

Extrapolation  of  efficacy  from  adult  patients  to  the  paediatric  population  within  the  approved  adult indications was considered feasible by the CHMP, as:

- -The  microorganisms  involved  in  the  infections  covered  by  the  claimed  indication  are  similar  in adults and children.  Gram-positive microorganisms such as S. aureus and streptococci are the main cause of skin and soft tissue infections in children and adults. Gram-negative microorganisms and anaerobes are the main pathogens involved in complicated intra-abdominal infection in both populations also.
- -The proposed dosing recommendations for the paediatric population result in a systemic exposure that is similar to that achieved by adult patients with a similar percent of target attainment.

In these circumstances, CHMP agreed that only PK and safety studies would be sufficient for granted a restricted indication for this subgroup of the paediatric population.

The dosing regimen proposed by the MAH (1.2 mg/kg every 12 h for children aged 8 to less than 12 years and 50 mg every 12h for children 12 to less than 18 years old) was considered adequate by the CHMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Extrapolation  of  efficacy  is  based  in  this  particular  case  on  two  approaches:  a  non-compartmental  PK analysis  of  the  data  of  study  2207  and  on  a  pop-PK  analysis  of  both  PK  paediatric  studies.  Both approaches were followed by simulations of several dosing regimens in the age range of interest (8 to less than 18) to identify the dose that would provide a similar percent of target attainment as compared to adult patients.

The AUC0-24h observed in adults at the approved dose is approximately 5.0 mg·h/L; thus, for AUC 012h, the target would be 2.5 mg·h/L. The value of the AUC(0-24)/MIC ratios that have been identified in adult  patients  are  ≥17.9  for  cSSTI  and  ≥6.96  for  cIAI.  For  cSSTI,  the  target  attainment  in  adults receiving the approved tigecycline dosing regimen of 100 mg followed by 50 mg q12h was estimated at 57.0% of patients while for cIAI the percent of attainment was 82.4% of patients. The estimated percent of  target  attainment for children aged 8 to less than 18 years based on the Monte-Carlo simulation is 81.6% for complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) and 54.5% for complicated skin and soft tissue infections  (cSSTI) for the proposed dose of 1.2 mg/kg every 12 hours. These figures for model-based simulation of the same dose are 86.5% and 62.0% for children aged 8 to less than 12 years. For children aged 12 to less than 18 years, the percent of target attainment according to model-based simulations for the proposed dose of 50 mg every 12 hours were 87.4% and 64.1% for cIAI and cSSTIs, respectively.

Therefore, pop-PK-PD model-based simulations of percent of target attainment led to higher estimates of paediatric  patients  at  or  above  the  adult  predefined  target.  It  can  be  discussed  whether  the  proposed dose of 1.2 mg/kg for children aged 8 to less than 12 years is appropriate or whether a lower dose such as 1 mg/kg may be more appropriate. In this respect CHMP agreed with the MAH's proposal due to the fact that tigecycline is expected to be used for the treatment of serious infections in children when no other  alternatives  can  be  used.  In  addition,  safety  of  tigecycline  can  be  easily  monitored  in  clinical practice. Second, because the residual error of the pop PK model was estimated to be 43.3%. Such a high value may have an impact in based-model simulations.

The main set of efficacy data is that from study 2207 which included children with cIAI, cSSTI and with community acquired pneumonia. Efficacy results are provided descriptively. Clinical cure at TOC is higher for the lowest dose (0.75 mg/kg) than for the other two. However, the low number of patients and the lack  of  standardisation  regarding  concomitant  antibiotic  therapy  (other  than  tigecycline)  may  have influenced the results (among others) and do not permit to draw appropriate conclusions.

Based  on  the  data  presented  concerning  the  compassionate  use  and  use  reported  in  the  literature,  it appears that most of the paediatric use is outside of the approved indications in adults (bacteraemia, cystic fibrosis, meningitis, pneumonia) and across all paediatric age subsets (the youngest child treated with  tigecycline  was  a  2.5-month-old  child).  The  outcomes  differ  according  to  the  indication  in  which tigecycline  is  used  but  are  indicative  that  tigecycline  has  the  potential  for  treating  serious  infections where  other  alternatives  are  not  available  or  have  failed.  The  review  of  these  data  also  shows  that tigecycline is usually administered in combination with other antibiotics.

From a safety perspective, the review of the data does not raise concern in the sense that the safety profile  seems  to  be  similar  to  that  of  adult  patients  in  terms  of  the  type  of  adverse  events  reported. However, it is unclear whether some adverse reactions have been more frequently reported by children. The wording of section 4.8 has been amended by the MAH and the frequency of nausea and vomiting is provided suggesting that this is the only relevant difference in safety between adults and children.

The main uncertainties related to the present submission refer to the PK-PD model assumptions that may affect the accuracy of model-based simulations and to the fact that the proposed doses have not been tested  in  a  sufficient  number  of  paediatric  patients  with  the  infections  of  interest.  CHMP  agreed  that, despite the fact that efficacy and safety data were limited, the proposed dose was in the range of those studied in study 2207 and has been shown to produce a number of adverse events (in particular, nausea

and vomiting) in a high percentage of the treated patients. Nausea and vomiting were, however, of mild to moderate severity in most cases.

It  was  also  acknowledged  that  Tygacil  was  expected  to  be  used  only  in  children  for  the  treatment  of serious infections caused by microorganisms resistant to other, more commonly used antibiotics.  CHMP agreed that in these cases it was highly desirable that dosing recommendations were made available to guide the prescriber. CHMP also agreed to update other sections of the Tygacil SmPC with information relevant to the use of tigecycline in the paediatric population.

CHMP considered that the overall benefit-risk of tigecycline for children aged 8 to less than 18 years is positive for the indications claimed.

## 4. Recommendations

## Final Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of Indication to include the restricted use of Tygacil in paediatric patients ≥8 years to &lt;18 years of age for Tygacil.

As a consequence, update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.

## Paediatric data

Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0292/2014 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

## 5. EPAR changes

The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 8 \" steps after the authorisation \" will be updated as follows:

## Scope

Extension of Indication to include the restricted use of Tygacil in paediatric patients ≥8 years to &lt;18 years of age for Tygacil.

As a consequence, update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Summary

This is an extension of indication for the restricted use of Tygacil (tigecycline) in paediatric patients ≥8 years  to  &lt;18  years  of  age.  The  agreed  indications  for  tigecycline  in  children  are  the  same  as  those approved for  adult  patients.  This  decision  was  based  on  data  two  paediatric  PK  studies,  an  ascending single-dose study in subjects 8 to 16 years of age recovering from infections (study 110), and a multipledose study in patients 8 to 11 years with cSSTI, cIAI, or community-acquired pneumonia (study 2207) supported by data from children who received tigecycline in the setting of compassionate use, data on the paediatric  use  reported  in  the  literature  and  data  from  a  summary  of  the  microbiology  data  from  the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) of pathogens isolated from children 8 to &lt;18 years of age.
