- Occurrence of new onset of chronic illness (e.g. autoimmune disorders, asthma, type I diabetes and allergies) during the 31-day period (Days 0-30) following the booster vaccination.

Statistical methods: The statistical analyses were performed using the SAS® software version 9.2 and Proc StatXact 8.1.

Analyses were performed as per the study Reporting and Analysis Plan (RAP). Only the statistical methods pertaining to the Month 32 persistence time-point are described.

## Analysis of demographics/baseline characteristics:

- Demographic characteristics of each study cohort were tabulated: age at Month 32 and months since the primary vaccination (Month 0 for the ACWY-TT and MenCCRM groups in the primary vaccination study MENACWY-TT-081 PRI [111414]) at each persistence time-point, gender, and geographic ancestry.
- The mean age (at the persistence time-point (in years) [with the range and standard deviation]) as well as the proportion of males and females were calculated and presented by group.
- The distribution of subjects enrolled at Month 32 among the study sites was tabulated as a whole and per group and reason for not attending a visit at Month 32 among all subjects who participated in the primary vaccination study MENACWY-TT-081 PRI (111414) were summarized.

## Analysis of persistence

For Month 32 : The analysis of antibody persistence was based on the According to Protocol (ATP) cohort for antibody persistence at Month 32. If, for any vaccine group, the percentage of subjects who came back for the Month 32 follow-up with serological results excluded from the ATP cohort was higher than 5%, a second analysis based on the Total Vaccinated Cohort Month 32 was to be performed to complement the ATP analysis.

For each treatment group, at each blood sampling time-point, for each antigen assessed:

- Geometric mean titres (GMTs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were tabulated.
- Percentages of subjects with titres above the proposed cut-offs with exact 95% CIs were calculated.
- The distribution of antibody titres was presented using reverse cumulative curves.

## Summary:

Immunogenicity: The analysis of antibody persistence was based on the ATP cohort for antibody persistence at Month 32. Since, for any vaccine group, the percentage of subjects who came back for the Month 32 follow-up with serological results excluded from the ATP cohort was not higher than 5%, a second analysis based on the Total cohort at Month 32 was not performed to complement the ATP analysis.

Note that since the rSBA serological testing at pre-vaccination and one month post-vaccination in study MENACWY-TT-081 PRI (11141) were performed at GSK laboratories, and whereas the rSBA testing at Month 32 post-vaccination were performed at Health Protection Agency (HPA) laboratories in the United Kingdom, these data are presented in separate tables and the antibody kinetics and decay from pre-vaccination and one month postvaccination in study MENACWY-TT-081 PRI (11141) to the Month 32 time-point cannot be directly assessed.

Assessor's comment: The switch from GSK to HPA testing for rSBA was previously communicated during the MAA application.  This change in methodology precludes direct assessment of the antibody kinetics and decay from pre-vaccination and one month post-vaccination to the month 32 time-point.  Such a direct comparison of month 32 with later time points; namely the planned analyses at months 44, 56 and 68 after primary vaccination will be possible when further data is available from the ongoing study.

## At Month 32 after primary vaccination,

- The percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenA titres ≥1:8 were 86.5% in the ACWY-TT group and 21.7% in the MenCCRM group.
- The percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenC titres ≥1:8 were 64.6% in the ACWY-TT group and 76.8% in the MenCCRM group.
- The percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenW-135 titres ≥1:8 were 77.2% in the ACWY-TT group and 7.2% in the MenCCRM group.
- The percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenY titres ≥1:8 were 81.3% in the ACWY-TT group and 14.5% in the MenCCRM group.

GMT = geometric mean antibody titre calculated on all subjects

N = number of subjects with results available n/% = number/percentage of subjects with titre equal to or above specified value

95% Cl = 95% confidence interval; LL = Lower Limit, UL = Upper Limit

PI(M32) = Month 32, 32 months post-primary vaccination

One finding of the vaccination study MenACWY-TT-081 was that the GSK rSBA MenC-GMT elicited by Menjugate was higher than the one observed for the MenACWY-TT vaccine (5292.6 vs. 2794.8; 95% CI of the GMT ratio excluded the value of 1).  It has been concluded that the clinical relevance of this finding is limited given that GMTs were high in both groups and no statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of percentage of subjects with rSBA titres titres ≥ 8 and ≥ 128 (the percentage of subjects with GSK rSBAMenC titre ≥128 was 99.3% in the ACWY-TT group versus 100% in the MenCCRM group).

Assessor's comment: What is noted in the table above is the low percentage of the ACWY-TT group with titres equal to or above the cut-off values of 1:4 and 1:8 for hSBA-MenA GSK assay.

However the results for rSBA-MenA (synopsis Table 3) show a high percentage of subjects with titres equal to or above the cut-off values of 1:4 and 1:8 and a clear difference between the two vaccination groups.  It is also noted that larger numbers contributed to the rSBA tests performed by HPA.

The rapid waning of serum bactericidal antibody titres against MenA when using human complement in the assay is already highlighted in the SmPC.

## Safety:

No analysis of safety was performed in this study at the Month 32 persistence time-point. All reported SAEs considered related to study procedures were to be described in detail. SAEs related to a concomitant GSK drug or vaccine were to be collected and reported to regulatory authorities.

No SAEs related to study participation or related to concurrent GSK medication were reported from the end of the six-month Extended Safety Follow-up period following vaccination in study MENACWY-TT-081 PRI (11141) until the Month 32 persistence time-point.

## MAH Conclusions:

- The percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenA titres ≥1:8 at Month 32 were 86.5% in the ACWYTT group and 21.7% in the MenCCRM group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenC titres ≥1:8 at Month 32 were 64.6% in the ACWY-TT group and 76.8% in the MenCCRM group.
- The percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenW-135 titres ≥1:8 at Month 32 were 77.2% in the ACWY-TT group and 7.2% in the MenCCRM group.
- The percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenY titres ≥1:8 at Month 32 were 81.3% in the ACWYTT group and 14.5% in the MenCCRM group.
- No SAEs considered to be possibly related to vaccination by the investigator or considered related to study participation were reported from the end of the six-month Extended Safety Follow-up period following vaccination in study MENACWY-TT-081 PRI (111414) until the Month 32 persistence time-point.

## V. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

##  Overall conclusion

For P46 017 the data consisted of Month 32 follow-up data on immunogenicity and safety from Study MenACWYTT-088 EXT081.

In view of the changes in rSBA testing from GSK to HPA,  it is not possible to assess the antibody kinetics and decay from pre-vaccination and one month post-vaccination to the month 32 time-point.  Such a direct comparison of month 32 with later time points; namely the planned analyses at months 44, 56 and 68 after primary vaccination will be possible when further data is available from the ongoing study.

No SAEs occurred during this follow-up period.

The MAH is planning a variation application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e containing several studies to update the labelling with available persistence data) and expects to submit this by the beginning of 2013.

No SmPC changes are required following from this article 46 procedure.

##  Recommendation

No further action required.
