## 1. Introduction

On 25 September 2024, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Paxlovid, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

It has to be underlined that these data from study C4671018 are expected to be submitted and assessed as part of a post-authorisation measure . This current P46 procedure will only focus on paediatric data from this study (i.e. 13 subjects).

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

This study is being submitted in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation (European Commission [EC] No 1901/2006). The MAH is submitting the final clinical study report (CSR) for study C4671018. The Marketing Authorisation Holder is not proposing any amendments to the Paxlovid EU Summary of Product Characteristics to add data from Study C4671018.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Study C4671018 was a post-marketing study conducted under real clinical settings. Thus, participants were prescribed the commercial nirmatrelvir/ritonavir product (Paxlovid pack: nirmatrelvir tablet 150 mg + ritonavir tablet 100 mg).

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for study C4671018 (PAXLOVID PACK General Investigation). This study was conducted in patients treated with Paxlovid to assess the safety and efficacy of this drug under post-marketing actual status of use. As of July 2024, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir has received regulatory approval or authorisation in over 82 countries. Of note, Paxlovid is indicated in US for the treatment of paediatric patients (12 years of age and older, weighing at least 40 kg). Therefore, of the 2948 participants who have completed the study, 13 of them were paediatric participants.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## C4671018, PAXLOVID PACK General Investigation

## Description

This is a post-marketing open-label study assessing the efficacy and safety of Paxlovid administered under real clinical settings.

## Methods

## Study participants

Participants treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to assess the safety and efficacy of this drug under postmarketing actual status of use. The sample size goal was 3000 participants to be included via continuous registration system. A total of 2829 participants were assigned to treatment, 13 of which were paediatric participants.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

The usual dosage for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for adults and paediatric participants aged 12 years or older with body weight of 40 kg or more was 300 mg nirmatrelvir and 100 mg ritonavir administered orally at the same time twice daily for 5 days. nirmatrelvir and 100 mg of ritonavir was administered orally at the same time twice daily for 5 days.

For patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 mL/min to &lt;60 mL/min), 150 mg of Administration of this drug to patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt;30 mL/min) was not recommended.

## Objective

This study was conducted in patients treated with this drug to assess the safety and efficacy of this drug under post-marketing actual status of use.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The following efficacy endpoints were examined: - Presence or absence of the worsening of severity and highest severity of infection caused by SARSCoV-2, - Death from any cause, and

- Hospitalisation for treatment of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 or death from any cause.

## Sample size

The sample size goal was 3000 participants to be included via continuous registration system.

## Statistical Methods

The Safety Analysis Set was defined as a population of registered or reported participants excluding of registration, no information on administration, or no information on AEs (reinvested but no description irrespective of re-visit).

those who met any one of the following conditions: CRF not collected, contract violation/flaw, violation The Efficacy Analysis Set 1 (participants evaluable for efficacy) consisted of the population excluding participants who met any one of the following: CRF not collected, contract violation/flaw, violation of registration, no information on administration, no information on AEs (reinvested but no description or no re-visit) and the following conditions 1 to 3: 1. Efficacy cannot be evaluated appropriately because the condition for assessing efficacy is not met (description in the report, 'efficacy not evaluable') Condition: No AEs are reported, the status of hospitalization is not reported, and both the presence or absence of worsening of severity after the start of administration of this drug and the presence or absence of symptoms on the end date of the observation period are not reported. 2. Disease not subject to the study (description in the report, 'disease not subject to the study')

Condition: The disease name is other than infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3. Inadequate treatment period or dose (description in the report, 'inadequate administration') Condition: Nirmatrelvir has not been administered.

In addition, efficacy was also analysed in a subset of participants in the Efficacy Analysis Set 2 (patients in Efficacy Analysis Set 1 who were outpatient) and Efficacy Analysis Set 3 (patients in Efficacy Analysis Set 2 who had risk factors for increased severity).

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 3346 participants were enrolled at 169 sites, and CRFs of 3345 participants were collected (CRFs could not be collected for 1 participant because the participant refused to provide data). All the 3345 participants whose CRFs were collected completed the study. Of the 3345 participants, 397 participants did not provide the consent, and 2948 participants excluding these participants completed the study.

Safety Analysis Set: 2829 participants were included, and 13 participants without information on administration and 106 participants without information on AEs (no re-visit) were excluded.

Efficacy Analysis Set 1: 2828 participants were included, and 13 participants without information on administration, 106 participants without information on AEs (no re-visit), and 1 participant with disease not subject to the study (false-positive and negative result after the second test) were excluded.

The Efficacy Analysis Set 2 consisted of 1965 participants in the Efficacy Analysis Set 1, excluding 863 participants who were not outpatients at the start of administration. The Efficacy Analysis Set 3 consisted of 1905 participants in the Efficacy Analysis Set 2, excluding 60 participants without any risk factors for aggravation.

Of the 2829 participants who were assigned to treatment, 13 were paediatric participants.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Baseline data

Of the 2829 participants in the Safety Analysis Set, 53.20% (1505/2829 participants) were male and 46.80% (1324/2829 participants) were female. The participants' ages were &lt;15 years in 0.07% (2/2829 participants), &lt;18 years in 0.46% (13/2829 participants), ≥18 years in 99.54% (2816/2829 participants), ≥65 years in 50.30% (1423/2829 participants), and ≥75 years in 30.01% (849/2829 participants). The mean age was 63.1±18.0 years. At the start of administration of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, 69.49% (1966/2829 participants) were outpatients and 30.51% (863/2829 participants) were inpatients. The severity of the symptoms of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 (assessed by the investigators in reference to the 'Clinical Management of Patients with COVID-19. A guide for front-line healthcare workers Version 6.21.') was mild in 80.81% (2286/2829 participants), moderate I in 12.30% (348/2829 participants), and moderate II in 2.79% (79/2829 participants). No participants were assessed as severe.

## Rapporteur's comment:

Baseline characteristics only for paediatric subjects were not available, but such a request does not appear to be relevant considering the small size of this group.

## Number analysed

Of the 2829 participants in the Safety Analysis Set, the observation period up to Day 28 after the completion of administration (the day following the completion of administration was defined as Day 1) was completed in 2173 participants (76.81%) and discontinued in 656 participants (23.19%). Reasons for termination/discontinuation of observation during the observation period are as follows:

## Efficacy results

Presence or Absence of the Worsening of Severity and Highest Severity of Infection Caused by SARSCoV-2

Of the participants in the Efficacy Analysis Sets 1, 2, and 3 (2828, 1965, and 1905 participants, respectively), the severity worsened in 62 participants (2.19%; 95% CI, 1.68% to 2.80%), 32 participants (1.63%; 95% CI, 1.12% to 2.29%), and 32 participants (1.68%; 95% CI, 1.15% to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2.36%), respectively, and the severity did not worsen in 2680 participants (94.77%), 1860 participants (94.66%), and 1802 participants (94.59%), respectively.

No paediatric patient experienced worsening disease severity. Death From Any Cause In the Efficacy Analysis Set 1 (2828 participants), 15 participants (cumulative incidence, 0.60%; 95% CI, 0.36% to 0.99%) died by Day 28 after the start of administration. Among the deaths from any cause reported in Study C4671018, none were from participants in the paediatric age group (&lt;18 years). Hospitalisation for Treatment of Infection Caused by SARS-CoV-2 or Death From Any Cause In the Efficacy Analysis Set 2 (1965 participants), 94 participants (cumulative incidence, 4.82%; 95% CI, 3.96% to 5.87%) were hospitalised for the treatment of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 or died from any cause by Day 28 after the start of administration. One participant was hospitalised for the treatment of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 after Day 29 (admitted to the hospital on Day 32). The mean period of exposure to risk of events after the start of administration was 29.5 days. In the Efficacy Analysis Set 3 (1905 participants), 93 participants (cumulative incidence, 4.92%; 95% CI, 4.03% to 6.00%) were hospitalised for the treatment of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 or died from any cause by Day 28 after the start of administration. One participant was hospitalised for the treatment of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 after Day 29 (admitted to the hospital on Day 32). The mean period of exposure to risk of events after the start of administration was 29.6 days. Among paediatric patients in the Efficacy Analysis Set 3 (n=7), 1 participant was hospitalized for the treatment of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.

## Rapporteur's comment:

As regards paediatric patients, the efficacy data on 13 subjects &lt;18 years old treated with Paxlovid did not report worsening disease severity or death. Among the 7 paediatric subjects who were not hospitalized at baseline, only 1 subject was hospitalized for the treatment of infection. Overall, these very limited data did not highlight any efficacy concern in paediatric subjects (12 to &lt;18 years old).

## Safety results

Of the 2829 participants in the Safety Analysis Set, adverse reactions occurred in 423 participants, and the incidence of adverse reactions was 14.95% (423/2829 participants). The most common adverse reactions (incidences ≥1%) were dysgeusia in 188 partici pants (6.65%), diarrhoea in 73 participants (2.58%), taste disorder in 42 participants (1.48%), and nausea in 33 participants (1.17%). The incidence of adverse reactions in the study is as expected and similar to the frequency reported in the core datasheet for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. The outcome of the majority of adverse reactions was resolved/recovered or improved; adverse reaction outcomes were not resolved in 7 participants (2 cases each of diarrhoea and nausea, and 1 case each of steroid diabetes, hypokalaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, dizziness, vertigo, coronary artery stenosis, peripheral artery thrombosis, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, hypertension, dysphagia, dyspepsia, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, aspartate aminotransferase increased, and alanine aminotransferase increased) and unknown in 12 participants. Of the 2829 participants in the Safety Analysis Set, serious adverse reactions occurred in 6 participants, and the incidence of serious adverse reactions was 0.21% (6/2829 participants).

lymphoma, decreased appetite, respiration abnormal, cholangitis acute, and acute kidney injury in 1 participant (0.04%) each. The outcomes were improved for acute kidney injury, cholangitis acute, and B-cell lymphoma; resolved/recovered for nausea (2 cases), decreased appetite, and Escherichia bacteraemia; and unknown for respiration abnormal.

Of the 2829 participants in the Safety Analysis Set, 13 were paediatric participants (&lt;18 years). The incidence of adverse reactions was 7.69% (1/13 participants), which was lower than the incidence in participants aged ≥18 years (14.99% [422/2816 particip ants]). The adverse reactions that occurred were diarrhoea and vomiting (both nonserious).

## Rapporteur's comment:

As regards paediatric patients, these very limited data did not highlight any new safety concern.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Overall, this open-label study performed in real clinical settings did not identify any efficacy or safety issues with the use of Paxlovid, notably in the limited paediatric population included.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Fulfilled:

No regulatory action required. Of note, the Applicant has already informed the EMA/Rapporteur on its intention to apply for an extension of indication in adolescents during Q1 2025.
