## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for nusinersen, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Three cases of aseptic meningitis were reported (in children aged 3, 11 and 13) who experienced clinical signs and symptoms consistent with meningitis shortly after receiving nusinersen treatment. Routine bacterial cultures and viral polymerase chain reaction studies (reported in 2 cases) were negative. Management included symptomatic treatment as well as treatment with antibiotics or steroids. The events resolved without reported sequalae and treatment with nusinersen continued for all 3 children. Among a total of 439 person years of nusinersen exposure in the post-marketing setting, the 3 cases of meningitis reported is more than expected based on comparisons with children in the general population (6 to 70 cases per 100,000 among young children and 3 to 5 cases per 100,000 among older children). Although the underlying mechanism of drug-induced aseptic meningitis (DIAM) remains unclear, it has been hypothesized that it may reflect a hypersensitivity reaction (although no reported history of allergies or hypersensitivity reactions in the 3 children) or that DIAM may result from direct irritation of the meninges with intrathecal drug administration. Considering the temporal relationship, absence of any other explanation for the meningitis, as well as the epidemiological evidence, the causality should be a reasonable possibility. Thus, the update of the product information as proposed by the MAH is agreed.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for nusinersen the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing nusinersen is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
