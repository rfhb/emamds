## 1. Background information on the procedure

Pursuant  to  Article  16  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  1234/2008,  Roche  Registration  GmbH submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 20 June 2024 an application for a variation.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                                           | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.13                | C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | Type II | None               |

Submission of the final report from study BP39056 (FIREFISH) listed as a category 3 study in the RMP; this  is  a  two-part  seamless,  open-label,  multi-center  study  to  investigate  the  safety,  tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of risdiplam in infants with type 1 spinal muscular atrophy.

The requested variation proposed no amendments to the Product Information.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

The MAH has presented the final report for study BP39056 (FIREFISH). This was a two-part, operationally seamless, open-label, multi-center study designed to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of risdiplam in infants with Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

The Part 2 primary efficacy objective was to assess the efficacy of risdiplam measured as the proportion of infants sitting      without support after 12 months of treatment, as assessed in the gross motor scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development - Third Edition (BSID-III), defined as sitting without support for 5 seconds.

The primary endpoint was met. The clinical value of this primary endpoint has been thoroughly discussed as limited. Notwithstanding, the other endpoints globally support the primary endpoint results, and some have significant clinical meaning, such as the ability to swallow, keep sitting for 30 seconds and ability to stand.

Regarding safety, and although seven deaths have been reported in the early part of the study, these are expected in the natural history of the disease and did not seem related to the treatment.

In conclusion, both the efficacy and safety data observed support the persistent effect of risdiplam up to 5 years of follow-up, with some milestones being acquired after three years of treatment.

No update to SmPC is considered needed at this point.

The benefit-risk balance of Evrysdi, remains positive.

## 5. Introduction

The objective of this variation is to provide the final results from study BP39056 (FIREFISH), a two-part seamless,  open-label,  multi-center  study  to  investigate  the  safety,  tolerability,  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics  and  efficacy  of  risdiplam  (RO7034067)  in  infants  with  Type  1  Spinal  Muscular Atrophy. As an additional pharmacovigilance activity in the RMP (category 3 study), this study was to address the below safety concerns for risdiplam: long-term safety and effect on epithelial tissues. Given that the MAH foresees a minimal impact on the content of the RMP and the benefit/risk profile of risdiplam remains favourable, the MAH proposes to update the RMP as part of a submission at a later date, hence an updated RMP (module 1.8.2) has not been submitted. The updated CSR of Study BP39056, was submitted as a type II, C.I.4 variation in August 2021.

## 6. Clinical Pharmacology aspects

## 6.1  Methods - analysis of data submitted

The PK and PD data in the current submission is based on the final data from Study BP39056 at the clinical cutoff date of 22 December 2023, which corresponds to the last patient last visit after 5 years in the  study.  Study  results  are  presented  in  the  Population  Pharmacokinetic,  Pharmacokinetic  and Pharmacodynamic Analyses Report for Risdiplam (code 1131437, dated May 2024).

The objective of report 1131437 was to describe risdiplam PK of the 62 patients with Type 1 SMA of Study BP39056 at Year 5 Visit, until a clinical cutoff date (CCOD) of 22 December 2023. A PPK model previously  developed  using  the  pooled  data  set  of  Studies  BP29840,  BP39054,  BP39055,  BP39056, BN40703 and BP41361 served as the reference PPK model in the present analysis.

Specifically, the analysis was performed to:

- Evaluate the previously developed population PK model against the updated data collected from Study BP39056 up to Year 5 Visit.
- Derive secondary PK parameters (AUC0-24h and Cav) of 62 SMA patients to evaluate risdiplam exposure.
- Investigate relationships between risdiplam exposure and pharmacodynamic (PD) markers SMN protein and SMN2 mRNA.

Concentrations of risdiplam were quantified in human plasma using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LS-MS/MS) method. The calibration  range  was  0.250  to  250  ng/mL  in plasma. For samples with a concentration higher than the upper limit of the calibration range, the sample was re-analyzed after dilution, and the dilution factor applied for calculation of the concentration.

The PPK analyses and all simulations were performed using NONMEM version 7.4. The estimation method First Order Conditional Estimation (FOCE) with interaction implemented in NONMEM was used in PPK modelling.  Perl-speaks-NONMEM  (PsN)  version  4.9.3  was  used  for  bootstrap  analyses.  All  graphical analyses were performed using R version 4.0.3 with RStudio version 1.2.1335.

The reference PPK model was performed for a total of 13,030 observations of 551 subjects (61 healthy subjects  and  490  SMA  patients)  of  either  of  the  six  clinical  studies  BP29840,  BP39054,  BP39055, BP39056, BN40703 or BP41361. The PPK model comprises a three transit compartment absorption model connected  to  a  systemic  linear  two-compartmental  PK  model.  Inter-individual  variability  (IIV)  was estimated for the absorption transit rate (ktr), the apparent clearance (CL/F) and the apparent central volume of distribution (Vc/F). Proportional residual errors were separately estimated for venous and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

capillary  samples.  Time-varying  body  weight  (power  model  structure  with  estimated  allometric exponents) and a factor of CL/F for healthy adults were included as covariates of the model. In addition, a maturation function with time-varying age consists of a sigmoidal model with Fracbirth, a fraction of CL/F  at  birth,  was  also  implemented  to  CL/F.  Time-varying  body  weight  effect  with  fixed  allometric coefficient of 1.0 was included for Vc/F and Vp/F. The summary of the population PK parameter estimates are summarized in Table 1. This model was used as the reference PPK model to initiate the present PK analysis.

The reference PPK model was fitted to the combined data set without parameter estimation step. The objective function value (OFV), precision of parameter estimates, goodness-of-fit (GOF) plots, predictioncorrected visual predictive check (pc-VPC) were examined to evaluate adequacy of the reference PPK model and necessity to adapt the model for the updated risdiplam PK data set.

Individual secondary PK parameters such as AUC0-24h and average concentration from the first dose to the Year 5 Visit (Cav) were derived using the post-hoc PK parameters of the PPK model, patients actual demographics and risdiplam dosing records. The cumulative AUC was calculated within NONMEM for each subject and AUC0-24h was extracted at specific time points for evaluation of exposure. The Cav was derived by dividing the cumulative AUC from the first dose until up to the Year 5 Visit.

## Plasma Concentrations

A total of 15,654 plasma samples for measurement of risdiplam concentrations were collected from 552 subjects who participated in Studies BP29840, BP39054, BP39055, BP39056, BN40703 and BP41361. There were additional 278 samples available from Study BP39056 as of CCOD of 22 December 2023 since the PPK modelling of risdiplam conducted in 2021. After excluding 424 samples, the remaining 15,230 observations including 476 capillary blood samples (3.1%) were available for the analysis.

The  maximum plasma concentration  and  trough  concentration  at  around  Year  5  visit  per  individual patient of Study BP39056 is summarized in Table 3. The individual plasma concentration time profiles included in the PPK analysis are shown in Figure 1 (linear scale) and Figure 2 (semi-log scale).

The reference PPK model (Table 1) was fitted to the updated data set including newly collected data of Study BP39056 up to Year 5 Visit. Adequacy of the reference PPK model to predict risdiplam PK, focusing on the SMA patients of Study BP39056, was examined.

The GOFs and pc-VPC of the reference PPK model for Study BP39056 data are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively. These plots for Study BP39056 showed a tendency for slight under prediction of risdiplam concentrations of the patients with Type 1 SMA.

pc-VPC with time after the first dose (top) and time after last dose (bottom) are shown. Individual observations corrected by the respective prediction are shown with solid circles. Blue areas are prediction intervals of the 2.5th, median and 97.5th percentiles of predictions. Dotted and solid lines show 2.5th and 97.5th, and median of the observations, respectively.

In order to improve model predictions, inclusion of covariate effect of Type 1 SMA on clearance and volume of distribution was examined. Addition of the covariate effect on CL/F and Vc/F for the patients with Type 1 SMA significantly reduced OFV, and inclusion of the same covariate effects of CL/F on Q/F, and the covariate effect of Vc/F on Vp/F further decreased OFV. The estimated effect for Type 1 SMA was 18.4% lower CL/F and Q/F, and 20.4% lower Vc/F and Vp/F compared to subjects without Type 1 SMA (Table 4). The model parameters were well estimated with RSE &lt;28% and good consistency with the bootstrap analysis supported robustness of the parameter estimates. Shrinkage for CL/F, ktr and Vc/F were 2.44, 25.5 and 9.45%, respectively, indicating an ability to reliably estimate individual posthoc parameters.

GOF plots of the updated PPK model for all subjects and for Study BP39056 patients are shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6, respectively. Good consistency between DV and PRED, as well as IPRED was shown with most of them being homogeneously distributed around the identity line. Improvement in PRED and CWRES distributions for Study BP39056 data compared to the reference PPK model (Figure 3) was shown in Figure 6. The pc-VPC showed the ability of the model to adequately predict central tendency and interindividual variability of all subjects as well as the patients with Type 1 SMA as shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8, respectively. The individual secondary PK parameters of the patients with Type 1 SMA of Study BP39056 were estimated using the post-hoc parameters of the updated PPK model.

## Exploratory PKPD analyses of pharmacodynamic markers

The pharmacodynamics (PD) of risdiplam was evaluated by quantifying SMN protein and SMN2 mRNA in blood collected from SMA patients who participated in Studies BP39054, BP39055, and BP39056. In total 3912 SMN protein and 7047 mRNA samples from 466 SMA patients were available as of 22 December 2023. For SMN protein, the PKPD relationship was explored using estimated AUC0-24h derived using the post-hoc PK parameters of the updated PPK model, patient's actual demographics and risdiplam dosing records.  Time-matched  plasma  concentrations  of  risdiplam  were  used  for  investigating  the  PKPD relationship with SMN2 mRNA.

## SMN Protein

The SMN protein data at baseline and Year 5 Visit of the SMA patients of Study BP39056 are summarized in Table 6. The SMN protein as absolute values and fold change from baseline on Day 28 or later was plotted against the time-matched risdiplam AUC0-24h as shown in Figure 10. The PKPD relationship of Study BP39056 patients was compared with the SMA patients of Studies BP39054 and BP39055. Large variability was noted in the risdiplam AUC and SMN protein relationships. Overall, there was no obvious difference in risdiplam AUC and SMN protein relationships between SMA patients of Study BP39056 and two other studies.

Table 6. Summary of SMN protein at Baseline and Year 5 Visit of Study BP39056

| Values         | Absolutevalueat baseline (n=60)   | Absolutevalue atYear 5 Visit (n=46)   | Fold-change from baseline (n=44)   |

| Median [range] | 2.78 [0.423, 6.40]                | 4.96 [1.22, 12.9]                     | 1.88 [0.678, 9.87]                 |

Patients who withdrew from the study before 4 years of treatment were not included in the summary. SMN protein &lt;0.4 ng/mL were not included in the analysis [1]

## SMN2 mRNA

The relationship between plasma risdiplam concentration and fold-change from the baseline for SMN2 mRNA fulllength (SMN2FL mRNA), SMNΔ7 mRNA and the ratio of SMN2FL/ SMNΔ7 mRNA are graphically shown in Figure 11. The observed increase in full-length SMN2 mRNA, and the corresponding decrease in Δ7mRNA, were both well correlated with the time -matched plasma concentration of risdiplam, and no obvious  difference  in  the  relationship  was  seen  between  BP39056  vs.  BP39054  and  BP39055  SMA patients.

## 6.3 Discussion

A total of 2431 plasma risdiplam concentration data were available from 62 patients with Type 1 SMA of Study BP39056 by Year 5 Visit until CCOD of 22 nd  December 2023, which included 278 samples collected after the PPK modelling of risdiplam conducted in 2021. The reference PPK model developed previously generally well predicted the plasma concentrations of risdiplam obtained from all 525 subjects, however a  trend  to  under-predict  plasma  risdiplam  concentrations  in  the  patients  with  Type  1  SMA  in  Study BP39056 was noted. The objective of the analyses was to estimate individual secondary PK parameters and the minor bias shown for the patients with Type 1 SMA by the reference PPK model was not expected to have impact on the estimation.

Nevertheless, covariate effects  of  Type  1  SMA  was  explored  to  correct  the  minor  bias  in  population predictions. Inclusion of covariate effect of Type 1 SMA estimated 18.4% lower CL/F and Q/F, and 20.4% lower Vc/F and Vp/F than the subjects without Type 1 SMA which improved the predictions. Clinical relevance of these covariate effects was considered marginal. The median of estimated risdiplam AUC024h of 2530 ng▪h/mL and C av of 92.9 ng/mL at Year 5 Visit by the updated PPK model were comparable with the  estimates  by  the  reference  PPK  model  (AUC0-24h of  2380  ng▪h/mL  and  Cav  of  90.3  ng/mL),  indicating negligible impact of these covariates on estimation of individual secondary PK parameters.

The patients with Type 1 SMA of Study BP39056 switched from 0.2 mg/kg to 0.25 mg/kg before Year 2 Visit and four of the patients started receiving 5 mg before Year 5 Visit. The adaption of risdiplam dose along  with  increase  in  age  and  body  weight  according  to  the  approved  dosing  algorithm  sustained consistent risdiplam exposure between Year 2 to Year 5 Visits. The median AUC0-24h and Cav from Year 2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and Year 5 Visits were 2230 to 2530 ng▪h/mL, and 80.1 to 92.9 ng/mL, respectively, which were maintained within 20% difference in the 3 years of treatment duration.

The  relationship  between  risdiplam  AUC0-24h  and  SMN  protein  were  highly  variable,  and  an  obvious correlation was not seen within the exposure range with AUC0-24h values being mostly between 10003000 ng.h/mL. Risdiplam concentration-dependent shift in SMN2 mRNA splicing was observed. Neither relationship between risdiplam concentration - SMN protein or - SMN2 mRNA were different between the patients with Type 1 SMA of Study BP39056 vs. BP39054 and BP39055 patients.

## 7. Clinical Efficacy aspects

## 7.1 Methods - analysis of data submitted

This variation focusses on the analysis of efficacy results after 5 years of risdiplam treatment from Study BP39056  (FIREFISH),  which  was  a  two-part,  operationally  seamless,  open-label,  multi-center  study designed to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of risdiplam in infants with Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

The efficacy evaluation presented in this SCE is based on final results from Study BP39056 at the clinical cutoff date (CCOD) of 22 December 2023, which corresponds to the date the last patient completed their last study assessment after 5 years in the study.  The key features of this study are summarized in Table 7.

## Overview of Study Design

This  is  a  seamless  open-label,  single-arm,  multi-center  clinical  study  to  investigate  the  safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of risdiplam in Type 1 SMA infants. The study was conducted in two parts and followed by an open-label extension phase:

Exploratory Part 1: Part 1 is an open-label, dose escalation study in infants with Type 1 SMA aged 1 to 7 months (at time of enrollment). This exploratory part consists of at least 8 infants and up to 24 infants (if required) to assess the safety, PK and PD profile of risdiplam in infants and determine the dose for Part 2.

Confirmatory Part 2: Part 2 is an open-label, single-arm study in 40 infants with Type 1 SMA aged 1 to 7 months (at time of enrollment) to assess the efficacy of risdiplam at the dose selected in Part 1 over a 24-month treatment period, with the primary endpoint analyzed at 12 months of treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In both Part 1 and Part 2, after 24 months of treatment patients enter an open-label extension phase.

In both Part 1 and Part 2, after a patient completes Week 104 it may be possible for the patient to be allocated  to  another  site,  following  discussion  and  agreement  by  the  Sponsor.  If  this  occurs,  the reallocation will not be considered a new enrollment in the study.

The study will progress in an operationally seamless manner from Part 1 into Part 2 after the dose selection decision has been taken.

## End of Study

The EOS is defined as the date when the last patient last visit (LPLV) occurs. LPLV is expected to occur at the latest when the last patient enrolled in the study has completed 24 months in the treatment phase and 3 years in the open label extension.

The study will continue until the EOS, or as per local regulation, or per the Sponsor's decision to terminate risdiplam development. The length of the study will not exceed 5 years after the last patient is enrolled in the study.

After completion of 24 months of treatment, each patient enters the open-label extension phase for an additional 3 years. After a patient has completed 3 years in the open-label extension, the patient may continue in the study until EOS, provided that risdiplam is not commercially available in the patient's country.

## Number of study centers and countries

Part 1: 7 investigational sites across 5 countries (United States [2], Belgium [1], France [1], Italy [2], Switzerland [1]).

Part 2: 14 investigational sites across 10 countries (Italy [4], China [2], Brazil [1], Croatia [1], France [1], Japan [1], Poland [1], Russian Federation [1], Turkey [1], and United States [1]).

## Main inclusion / exclusion criteria

SMA, including:

- Genetic confirmation of homozygous deletion or compound heterozygosity predictive of loss of function of the SMN1 gene.
- Clinical history, signs or symptoms attributable to Type 1 SMA.

This study included infants with Type 1 SMA aged between      1 month and           7 months (inclusive) at the time of enrollment. For the first 3 patients enrolled in Part 1, required age was between 5 and 7 months inclusive, and a minimum body weight of 7 kg was required for the first patient only.

Doses and study treatment has been described in the Clinical Pharmacology section.

## Independent Review Committees

The  roles  of  the  external  independent  Data  Monitoring  Committee  and  Permanent  Ventilation Adjudication Committee have been previously reported and understood in interim analyses.

## Part 2

In Part 2, 52 patients were screened for enrollment, of whom 11 patients were screen failures. Reasons for  screening  failure  have  been  outlined  in  the  Primary  CSR  (1100385).  A  total  of  41  patients  were enrolled at 14 sites in 10 countries, described in the Primary CSR (1100385). Before Month 12 of the study, 3 patients in Part 2 died of SMA-related complications.

These deaths have been described in the Primary CSR (1100385).

A  total  of  38  patients  entered  the  open-label  extension  (OLE)  phase  and  36  patients  completed  60 months of risdiplam treatment. By the end of the study, 21 patients had completed the SFU period, and 17 patients had opted for continued access to risdiplam.

## Baseline disease characteristics

The baseline characteristics of patients (pooled Parts 1 and 2) were typical of a symptomatic Type 1 SMA population, with a median age of 1.5 months (range: 0.9-3.0 months) at symptom onset. The disease duration (time between onset of symptoms and first treatment) was &gt;3 months in 42 patients (67.7%) and &lt;=3 months in 20 patients (32.3%), for a median disease duration of 3.7 months (range: 1.0-6.0 months).

All patients had two SMN2 copies, as required by the study inclusion criteria. Median baseline scores for CHOP-INTEND (23.0), BSID-III (2.0), HINE-2 (1.0), and CMAP amplitude (0.2 mV) were low, as expected for this symptomatic patient population. Patients' levels of motor function at screening were also typical of this patient population, confirming that all patients had well-established disease by the time of study enrollment. The majority of patients (45/62; 72.6%) were receiving no pulmonary care at baseline; 13 patients  (21.0%)  were  receiving  non-invasive  ventilation  (bilevel  positive  airway  pressure;  BiPAP) support for &lt;     16 hours/day, and 5 patients were receiving cough assistance (4 patients [6.5%] received it daily as a prophylactic therapy [not acute-illness related] and 1 patient [1.6%] received it because of an ongoing illness). There were no patients requiring awake assisted ventilation. It is not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

possible to confirm if patients were receiving adequate standard of care for respiratory support in SMA (Finkel et al. 2018) at the time of the screening visit and baseline assessments.

Almost all patients (59/62; 95.2%) were able to swallow at baseline. The majority of patients (39/62; 62.9%) were fed exclusively by mouth, 2 patients (3.2%) were fed via a combination of oral and tube feeding, and 4 patients (6.5%) were fed via a feeding tube at baseline; information about feeding route at baseline was missing for 17 patients (27.4%).

## Prior Medication

Prior and ongoing medications (i.e., those that were started prior to onset of risdiplam treatment and that were ongoing at the date of first dose) for Part 1 and Part 2 have been reported in the Primary CSR (1100385).

## Concomitant Medication

In Part 1 and Part 2 combined, 61 of 62 patients (98.4%) received at least one concomitant medication for AEs, and 54 patients (87.1%) received concomitant medications that were not taken for AEs.

All 21 patients (100.0%) in Part 1 received concomitant medications for AEs on or after the date of the first dose of risdiplam. A total of 20 patients (95.2%) received concomitant medications on or after the date of the first dose of risdiplam that were not taken for AEs. The most common medications (taken by 4  patients  [19.0%]  or  more),  by  medication  class,  were:  ophthalmologicals  (13  patients;  61.9%); vaccines (12 patients; 57.1%); vitamins (10 patients; 47.6%); nasal preparations (6 patients, 28.6%); all  other  therapeutic  products,  drugs  for  constipation,  homeopathic  preparation,  immune  sera  and immunoglobulins,  stomatologicals  preparations,  and  antidiarrheals,  intestinal  anti-inflammatory/antiinfective agents (5 patients each; 23.8%); all other non-therapeutic products, cardiac therapy (included medications are also captured under other ATC classes that may reflect better the indication for which they were used), other dermatological preparations, otologicals, vasoprotectives, and cough and cold preparations (4 patients each; 19.0%).

A total of 40 patients (97.6%) in Part 2 received concomitant medications for AEs on or after the date of the first dose of risdiplam. These medications are discussed where relevant in the safety section. A summary of concomitant medications for AEs by PT is provided. A total of 34 patients (82.9%) received concomitant medications on or after the date of the first dose of risdiplam that were not taken for AEs. The most common medications (taken by &gt;= 10% of patients), by medication class, were: vaccines (25 patients,  61.0%);  ophthalmologicals  (23  patients,  56.1%);  vitamins  (15  patients,  36.6%);  other gynecologicals (8 patients, 19.5%, included medications are also captured under other ATC classes that reflect  better  the  indication  for  which  they  were  used);  immune  sera  and  immunoglobulins,  other dermatological preparations (6 patients each, 14.6%); and urologicals (5 patients, 12.2%).

## SMA-Related Surgeries and Procedures

After the date of first risdiplam dose, a total of 153 SMA-related surgeries or procedures have been performed in 34 patients (54.8%). This included 38 surgeries/procedures in 12 patients (57.1%) in Part 1 and 115 surgeries/procedures in 22 patients (53.7%) in Part 2.

## Exposure to Study Treatment

All 62 enrolled patients received at least one dose of risdiplam.

In pooled Parts 1 and 2 (62 patients), the median exposure duration was 60.0 months (range: 0.6-61.7 months). Dose intensity was defined as the number of doses actually received divided by the expected number of doses, expressed as a percentage. The median dose intensity was 100.0% (range: 96.4%100.0%). A total of 24 patients missed a maximum of 65 doses (median: 1.0).

## Summary of Efficacy

Baseline in CHOP-INTEND Score and 90% CI by Visit (ITT Population, Part 2 Patients)

## Time to Death

At 60 months following the start of risdiplam treatment, most patients in Part 2 were alive.

## EFFICACY- POOLED PARTS 1 AND 2

In the pivotal dose population, the efficacy data up to 24 months of risdiplam treatment demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements in complex motor function. These improvements demonstrated at 24 months  were  generally  sustained  through  the  60-month  study  duration,  with  some  patients  having further improvements, indicating long-term benefit for patients receiving risdiplam treatment.

An overview of efficacy findings from the Pivotal Dose ITT Population (n=58) after 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months of treatment, and survival and ventilation-free survival in the All Patients ITT Population (n = 62), are presented in Table 22.

## 7.3 Discussion

Efficacy  analyses  evaluating  the  proportions  of  patients  achieving  motor  function  and  development milestones  (as  assessed  by  the  BSID-III,  CHOP  INTEND,  and  HINE  2),  survival  and  ventilation-free survival, nutrition and swallowing, and healthcare utilization show moderate clinical improvements up to the first 24 months of risdiplam treatment.

The observed efficacy is in line with what is known from the short to medium term studies and the clinical practice that has been followed meanwhile.

The  improvements  demonstrated  at  24  months  were  generally  sustained  through  the  5-year  study duration, with some patients having further small improvements.

Of note, only 3 children in 41 have gained the ability to stand independently, and this ability to walk independently has occurred after the year 3 of treatment.

The PRO endpoints show that there is a benefit which is sustained, but the quality of life of both parents / caregivers and child is still significantly affected by the disease. (On the ITQOL the median score for the Global behavior item at Month 60 was 60.0 (range: 0-100)).

In  conclusion,  these  longer-term  efficacy  data  provide  relevant  evidence  of  the  continued  benefit  of risdiplam in patients with infantile-onset (Type 1) SMA.

## 8. Clinical Safety aspects

## 8.1 Methods - analysis of data submitted

The cumulative safety data is retrieved from Study BP39056 (FIREFISH). The FIREFISH study was a twopart, multicenter study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of risdiplam in infants with infantile-onset (Type 1) spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

The study was conducted in two parts and followed by a 3-year open-label extension phase.

- Exploratory Part 1: Part 1 was an open-label, dose escalation study in infants with Type 1 SMA aged  1  to  7  months  (at  time  of  enrollment).  This  dose-finding  part  assessed  the  safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profile of risdiplam and determined the dose for Part 2.

Once the dose for Part 2 was selected, all infants (including the first 4 infants enrolled at Dose Level 1) were given the possibility to continue receiving risdiplam at the dose selected for Part 2 as part of an extension phase until Month 24. Thereafter, the open-label extension (OLE) phase, beginning after 24 months of treatment, included regular monitoring of safety, tolerability and efficacy, and continued for an additional 3 years for each patient, as outlined below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Confirmatory Part 2: Part 2 was an open-label, single arm study in infants with Type 1 SMA aged 1 to 7 months (at time of enrollment) to assess the efficacy and safety of risdiplam at the dose selected in Part 1 over a 24-month treatment period, with the primary endpoint analyzed at 12 months of treatment.

The Part 1 comprised 7 investigational sites across 5 countries (United States [2], Belgium [1], France [1], Italy [2], Switzerland [1]) and Part 2 14 investigational sites across 10 countries (Italy [4], China [2], Brazil [1], Croatia [1], France [1], Japan [1], Poland [1], Russian Federation [1], Turkey [1], and United States [1]).

The administration of risdiplam was oral, once daily. The dose was adjusted throughout Part 1 based on the emerging PK data. Data from Part 1 were used to determine the starting dose levels for Part 2 [for infants &gt;1 month old and &lt;3 months old at enrollment: 0.04 mg/kg. For infants &gt;=3 months old and &lt;5 months old at enrollment: 0.08 mg/kg. For infants &gt;=5 months old at enrollment: 0.2 mg/kg]. The dose was adjusted to 0.2 mg/kg for all patients (based on review of individual PK data for each infant enrolled in Part 1 and Part 2), in order to reach the target exposure defined in the protocol as a mean AUC of &lt;=2000 ng.h/mL.

The duration of the study for each patient enrolled in Part 1 (not including the open-label extension [OLE]) was divided as follows:

- Treatment period: 24 months

The duration of the study for each patient enrolled in Part 2 (not including the OLE phase) was divided as follows:

- Treatment period: 24 months

The patient's treatment in the OLE continued for an additional 3 years, after completion of 24 months of treatment for a total of 5 years. After a patient had completed 3 years in the OLE, the patient could continue to receive study drug until the end of study (EOS), provided that risdiplam was not commercially available for the patient.

After the study completion or early withdrawal visit, patients had to complete a period of 52 weeks of follow-up.  In version 6 of the protocol, this follow-up was replaced with a phone call 30 days after this visit.

After study completion, patients who were going to continue with risdiplam treatment and did not have access to commercial drug remained on study treatment until they gained access, or until the last patient last visit.

The results from the FIREFISH Study up to the clinical cutoff date (CCOD) of 22 December 2023, which corresponds to the date the last patient completed their last study assessment after 5 years in the study are  presented.  Full  safety  information  from  this  study,  which  enrolled  21 patients  in  Part 1  and 41 patients in Part 2, is provided in the Final CSR, Study BP39056, Report 1126881.

By the end of the study, all patients were &gt;=2 years of age and most weighed &lt;20 kg and therefore received a dose of 0.25 mg/kg.

The overall key features of this study are summarized in the Table below.

## Assessment of Safety

Safety assessments consisted of monitoring and recording adverse events, including serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest; measurement of protocol-specified safety laboratory  assessments;  measurement  of  protocol-specified  vital  signs,  ECGs;  and  other  protocolspecified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study.

## Safety Plan

The  Safety  Plan  considers  observations  made  in  nonclinical  investigations,  including  Good Laboratory  Practice  (GLP)  toxicology  studies  in  rats  and  cynomolgus  monkeys,  and  the observations made in clinical trials. Hypothetical considerations are included in the interpretation of nonclinical and clinical data. The exposure cap of a mean AUC0-24h,ss 2000 ng.h/mL corresponds to the NOAEL in the 39-week toxicology study in cynomolgus monkey, i.e., the exposure level at which no adverse events were observed.

Only effects on the testes were observed at those exposure levels in another study in rats (effects on testes could not be assessed in cynomolgus monkey due to sexual immaturity of the animals (Risdiplam Investigator's Brochure)); parents of male subjects will be informed accordingly. In humans, the pachytene stage of meiosis is completed towards the end of fetal development. In this study, effects on the oocyte are not expected because premature infants will not be included. In juvenile and adult rat toxicity studies and in monkey toxicity studies, there was no effect on female reproductive organs or female fertility. Any effects on meiosis and oocyte maturation will be  further  investigated  in  a  pre-postnatal  toxicity  study  in  rats  (Risdiplam  Investigator's Brochure).

## Safety Monitoring

Based  on  observed  toxicity  in  nonclinical  studies  (see  Risdiplam  Investigator's  Brochure  for details), the following safety monitoring plan has been compiled:

-  Specialty medical doctors (ophthalmologist) will be identified who will be trained in risdiplam  observed  nonclinical  toxicological  findings  prior  to  study  start  to  follow-up quickly in case of any suspicious or actual adverse toxicity event.

- Ophthalmological assessments (see Section 4.6.1.8 for details)

-  Stopping  rules  for  individual  patients  have  been  defined  that  include  criteria  for treatment discontinuation in case of ophthalmic events (Section 5.2.4).

- Follow-up phone calls (as per the time-points in the SoA; Appendix 1, Appendix 2): parents or caregiver will be called by the Investigator or designee to monitor safety and tolerability  when  not  attending  the  clinic.  Assessments  will  include  adverse  events, concomitant medication review and significant life events.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Methods  and  Timing  for  Capturing  and  Assessing  Safety  Parameters:  The  Investigator  is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported  to  the  Sponsor  in  accordance  with  instructions  provided.  For  each  adverse  event recorded  on  the  Adverse  Event  eCRF,  the  Investigator  made  an  assessment  of  seriousness, severity, and causality.

## 8.2 Results

- A total of 950 AEs were reported in 62 patients (100.0%). In pooled Parts 1 and 2, the most frequently reported AEs (.10% of patients), by SOC, were the following:

●

Infections and infestations (98.4% [61 patients])

General disorders and administration site conditions (69.4% [43 patients])

Gastrointestinal disorders (66.1% [41 patients])

Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (59.7% [37 patients])

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (48.4% [30 patients])

Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications (25.8% [16 patients])

Metabolism and nutrition disorders (22.6% [14 patients])

Nervous system disorders (17.7% [11 patients])

Blood and lymphatic system disorders (14.5% [9 patients])

Eye disorders, investigations (12.9% [8 patients] each)

Congenital, familial, and genetic disorders, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (11.3% [7 patients] each)

- The majority of AEs (906 of 950 AEs) resolved. By the end of the study, 35 AEs were not resolved, and the  outcome  of  2  AEs  was  unknown.  The  unresolved  AEs,  by  SOC,  were  the  following: gastrointestinal disorders (10 AEs); musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (9 AEs); renal and urinary disorders (4 AEs); injury, poisoning, and procedural complications, nervous system  disorders  (3  AEs  each),  congenital,  familial  and  genetic  disorders  (2  AEs);  cardiac disorders, eye disorders, respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (1 AE each).
- The proportion of patients with Grade 3.5 AEs was 69.4% (43 patients with a total of 131 AEs). The proportion of patients with Grade 5 (fatal) AEs was 9.7% (6 patients with 7 AEs). The most common Grade 3.5 AEs by PT (. 5% of patients) were: pneumonia (40.3% [25 patients]), viral pneumonia (8.1% [5 patients]), respiratory distress (6.5% [4 patients]), and respiratory failure (6.5% [4 patients]).
- 6 patients (9.7%) died due to progressive disease and 1 patient (1.6%) died due to an AE of pneumonia.
- The  SAE  rate  per  100  patient-years  decreased  over  time.  Rates  of  SAEs  of  pneumonia  also decreased more than 2.fold between the first and second years of treatment. The most common SAEs  by  SOC  (.  5%  of  patients)  were:  Infections  and  infestations  (66.1%  [41  patients]),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (29.0% [18 patients]), Metabolism and nutrition disorders  (11.3%  [7  patients]),  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (9.7%  [6  patients]).  The  most common SAEs by PT (. 5% of patients) were: Pneumonia (45.2% [28 patients]) Respiratory distress (9.7% [6 patients]), Viral pneumonia (8.1% [5 patients]), Respiratory failure (8.1% [5 patients],  Respiratory  tract  infection  (6.5%  [4  patients]),  Acute  respiratory  failure  (6.5%  [4 patients]).

- 1  patient  (1.6%)  experienced  a  Grade  5  AE  of  viral  respiratory  tract  infection  that  led  to discontinuation of study treatment.
- 5  patients  (8.1%)  experienced  5  AEs  that  led  to  dose  modification  or  interruption  of  study treatment. Occurring in 1 patient for each, they were: Grade 4 hypoxia, Grade 3 diarrhea, Grade 3 pneumonia, Grade 1 vomiting, and Grade 1 pyrexia. All events resolved.
- There were no AEs of special interest.
- In the SOC Eye disorders, 9 AEs were reported in 8 patients (12.9%): conjunctival hyperaemia in 2 patients (3.2%); and macular cyst, retinal exudates, strabismus, heterophoria, subretinal fluid, eye movement disorder and astigmatism in 1 patient (1.6%) each. There was no change of risdiplam therapy due to the AEs. All AEs were assessed by the investigator as not related to risdiplam therapy. All AEs were mild except 2 moderate AEs (strabismus and heterophoria, both described in the Update CSR). All except 2 AEs resolved (heterophoria resolved with sequelae, described in the Update CSR), and astigmatism which did not resolve, new after the cutoff date of the Update CSR).
- 30  patients  (48.4%)  had  at  least  one  AE  coding  to  the  SOC  Skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue disorders. None of the 49 AEs were serious or led to a change in study medication.
- 41 patients (66.1%) had at least one AE coding to the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders. Most of the 120 AEs were non-serious and did not lead to a change in study medication. Analysis of the SOCs which include AEs representing possible effects on epithelial tissues showed that events were not suggestive of any effects of risdiplam on epithelial tissues.
- Hematological parameters were generally stable over time. High baseline eosinophil, lymphocyte,  and  platelet  counts  were  observed  in  some  patients  that  continued  to  be  high throughout  the  study.  None  of  the  values  were  assessed  as  clinically  significant  by  the investigator.
- Isolated shifts in laboratory parameters were observed, however these were not sustained over time  and  generally  were  not  clinically  significant.  As  expected  for  patients  with  SMA,  most patients had creatinine values below the LLN throughout the study, including at baseline
- Shifts in vital signs were observed; however, there was no trend and the percentage of patients with shifts toward higher values and shifts toward lower values was similar and did not increase over time.
- The percentage of patients with shifts from baseline in ECG parameters did not increase over time.
- Fifty-eight of 62 patients (93.5%) had at least one post-baseline ophthalmology assessment. Fifty-seven patients (100%) were followed up with an SD-OCT assessment at 12 months, 48

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients (87.3%) at 24 months, 45 patients (83.3%) at 36 months, 50 patients (94.3%) at 48 months, and 46 patients (86.8%) at 60 months which was the longest follow-up.

- During the safety follow-up period, 2 patients reported 8 AEs. One patient experienced nasal congestion, pyrexia (Grade 1 each; resolved), salivary hypersecretion (Grade 3; did not resolve), and 3 SAEs of cardiac arrest, hypoxia, and obstructive airways disorder, which were fatal. The other patient experienced one Grade 3 AE of pneumonia and one Grade 1 AE of diarrhea; both of which resolved. No events were assessed as related to the study treatment by the investigator.
- During the continued access period, 4 patients reported a total of 8 AEs. All AEs were Grade 1.2 except for 1 AE of oesophagitis (Grade 3). All cases resolved. There were 3 patients who reported a total of 5 SAEs, including 2 SAEs of respiratory failure, and 1 SAE each of acute respiratory failure  (these  3  SAEs  were  assessed  as  not  related  to  study  treatment  by  the  investigator), oesophagitis, and oesophageal stenosis (both assessed as related to study treatment by the investigator). All SAEs were Grade 1.2 except for 1 SAE of oesophagitis (Grade 3). All cases either resolved, were resolving, or resolved with sequelae.

## 1.1.1.

## Post marketing data

Risdiplam is currently approved in over 100 international markets (including the U.S. and E.U.) for the treatment of SMA. Since the International Birth Date (7 August 2020) through 6 February 2024 (data lock  point  for  the  PBRER  1128869), an estimated cumulative total of 14,341 patients have received risdiplam from marketing experience (European Economic Area [EEA] n = 4475; Rest of the World [RoW] n = 5402; U.S. n = 3773; Japan n = 691). Exposure was similar between the sexes (male n = 6716; female n = 6933 for EEA, RoW, and U.S.). The information that became available did not alter the known benefitrisk profile of risdiplam, and the benefit-risk profile of risdiplam in the authorized indication remains favorable. Refer to the PBRER 1128869, submitted on 12 April 2024 (procedure no: EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010925/202402) for more details.

## 8.3 Discussion

The results of the final analysis for Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) (which includes all efficacy and safety results for Part 1 and Part 2 from enrollment to the end of study after 5 years of treatment) was submitted by the MAH to fulfil the requirements of Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. As an additional pharmacovigilance activity in the RMP (category 3 study), this study was to address the following safety concerns for risdiplam: long-term safety and effect on epithelial tissues. The MAH proposed to update the RMP as part of a submission at a later date, hence an updated RMP (module 1.8.2) has not been submitted. This will be further assessed by the PRAC.

Overall,  results  from  the  FIREFISH  study  show  that  risdiplam  treatment  for  up  to  5  years  in symptomatic Type 1 SMA patients (the severe form of the disease), was well tolerated, and the safety remains consistent with its known safety profile. No new safety signals were identified.

In brief, results retrieved from 'All Patients Safety Population' show that all patients enrolled experienced at least 1 AE and there was a total of 950 AEs reported. AEs occurring in more than 10% of patients were pyrexia (64.5%), upper respiratory tract infection  (62.9%),  pneumonia  (50.0%),  constipation,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

diarrhea, nasopharyngitis (25.8% each), COVID-19, rhinitis, vomiting (21.0% each), bronchitis, cough, influenza, respiratory tract infection (19.4% each), urinary tract infection (17.7%), teething (12.9%), and respiratory failure (11.3%). Overall, 131 Grade =&gt;3 AEs were reported by 43 (69.4%) patients. For the majority of patients, Grade =&gt;3 AEs were reported in SOCs infections and infestations (58.1%), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (27.4%), and gastrointestinal disorders (11.3%).

The majority of AEs (909/950 AEs) were not considered by the investigator to be related to risdiplam. The most frequently reported treatment-related AE was hematuria (3 patients [4.8%]).

There were 7 deaths (11.3%) during the study; the cause of death was assessed as progressive disease for 6 patients and AE of pneumonia for 1 patient by the investigator.

There  were  51  patients  (82.3%)  who  experienced  a  total  of  150  SAEs.  All  but  7  SAEs  had resolved/improved (2 SAEs of pneumonia, 1 SAE of acute respiratory failure, 1 SAE of cardiac arrest, 1 SAE of respiratory failure, 1 SAE of respiratory tract infection, 1 SAE of respiratory tract infection viral. All were fatal and none were assessed as related to the study drug by the investigator). There were no new deaths reported in the study since the Primary CSR (1100385), after the 24-month clinical cutoff. One patient experienced an AE of respiratory tract infection viral (1.6%) which led to discontinuation of study treatment.

No events or findings suggestive of the non-clinical safety findings (risdiplam induced effects on epithelial tissues, retinal toxicity and hematological effects) were observed in these patients with infantile-onset (Type 1) SMA.

A review of all available safety laboratory results, vital signs, ECGs, and ophthalmological assessments did not show any clinically significant adverse findings compared with baseline.

According to the MAH post-marketing data, where an estimated cumulative total of 14,341 patients have received risdiplam did not alter the known benefit-risk profile of risdiplam, and the benefit-risk profile of risdiplam in the authorized indication remains favorable.
