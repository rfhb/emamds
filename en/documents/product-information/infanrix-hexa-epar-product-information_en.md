## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Powder and suspension for suspension for injection.

The diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, inactivated poliomyelitis (DTPa-HBV-IPV) component is a turbid white suspension.

The lyophilised Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) component is a white powder.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Infanrix hexa is indicated for primary and booster vaccination of infants from the age of 6 weeks and toddlers against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b.

The use of Infanrix hexa should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

## Primary vaccination

The primary vaccination schedule consists of two or three doses (of 0.5 ml) which should be administered according to official recommendations (see the table below in this section and section 5.1 for schedules evaluated in clinical trials).

The Expanded Program on Immunisation schedule (at 6, 10, 14 weeks of age) may only be used if a dose of hepatitis B vaccine has been given at birth.

Where a dose of hepatitis B vaccine is given at birth:

- Infanrix hexa can be used as a replacement for supplementary doses of hepatitis B vaccine from the age of six weeks. If a second dose of hepatitis B vaccine is required before this age, monovalent hepatitis B vaccine should be used.
- Infanrix hexa can be used for a mixed pentavalent/hexavelent vaccine primary immunisation schedule in accordance with official recommendations.

Locally established immunoprophylactic measures against hepatitis B should be maintained.

Infanrix hexa can be replaced by the adminstration of a pentavalent vaccine co-adminsitered with hepatitis B vaccine.

## Booster vaccination

After a 2-dose or a 3-dose primary series vaccination with Infanrix hexa, a booster dose with Infanrix hexa should be given at least 6 months after the last priming dose (see the table below in this section and section 5.1 for schedules evaluated in clinical trials).

Infanrix hexa may be used as a booster in individuals who have previously been vaccinated with another hexavalent vaccine or a pentavalent DTPa-IPV+Hib vaccine associated with a monovalent hepatitis B vaccine for their primary series.

When a booster dose with a hexavalent DTPa (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis) containing vaccine is not available, a dose of Hib vaccine must be administered, as a minimum.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Infanrix hexa in children over 36 months of age have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Infanrix hexa is for deep intramuscular injection, preferably at alternating sites for subsequent injections.

For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or formaldehyde, neomycin and polymyxin.

Hypersensitivity after previous administration of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, polio or Hib vaccines.

Infanrix hexa is contraindicated if the infant or toddlers has experienced an encephalopathy of unknown aetiology, occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine. In these circumstances pertussis vaccination should be discontinued, and the vaccination course should be continued with diphtheria-tetanus, hepatitis B, polio and Hib vaccines.

As with other vaccines, administration of Infanrix hexa should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe febrile illness. The presence of a minor infection is not a contraindication.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Vaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to previous vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable events) and a clinical examination.

As with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1).

Infanrix hexa will not prevent disease caused by pathogens other than Corynebacterium diphtheriae , Clostridium tetani , Bordetella pertussis , hepatitis B virus, poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b. However, it can be expected that hepatitis D will be prevented by immunisation as hepatitis D (caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection.

If any of the following events are known to have occurred in temporal relation to receipt of pertussiscontaining vaccine, the decision to give further doses of pertussis-containing vaccines should be carefully considered:

-  Temperature of ≥ 40.0°C within 48 hours of vaccination, not due to another identifiable cause;
-  Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours of vaccination;
-  Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting ≥ 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination;
-  Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination.

There may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits outweigh possible risks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.

As for any vaccination, the risk-benefit of immunising with Infanrix hexa or deferring this vaccination should be weighed carefully in an infant or in a child suffering from a new onset or progression of a severe neurological disorder.

Infanrix hexa should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects.

Do not administer the vaccine intravascularly or intradermally.

A history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) do not constitute a contraindication for the use of Infanrix hexa. Vaccinees with a history of febrile convulsions should be closely followed up as such adverse events may occur within 2 to 3 days post vaccination.

The physician should be aware that the rate of febrile reactions is higher when Infanrix hexa is coadministered with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7, PCV10, PCV13), or with a measlesmumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine, compared to that occurring following the administration of Infanrix hexa alone. These reactions were mostly moderate (less than or equal to 39°C) and transient (see sections 4.5 and 4.8).

Increased reporting rates of convulsions (with or without fever) and hypotonic hyporesponsive episode (HHE) were observed with concomitant administration of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 (see section 4.8).

Prophylactic administration of antipyretics before or immediately after vaccine administration can reduce the incidence and intensity of post-vaccination febrile reactions. Clinical data generated with paracetamol and ibuprofen suggest that the prophylactic use of paracetamol might reduce the fever rate, while prophylactic use of ibuprofen showed a limited effect in reducing fever rate. The use of prophylactic antipyretic medicinal products is recommended for children with seizure disorders or with a prior history of febrile seizures.

Antipyretic treatment should be initiated according to local treatment guidelines.

## Special populations

HIV infection is not considered as a contraindication. The expected immunological response may not be obtained after vaccination of immunosuppressed patients.

Clinical data indicate that Infanrix hexa can be given to preterm infants, however, as expected in this population, a lower immune response has been observed for some antigens (see section 4.8 and section 5.1).

The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered when administering the primary immunisation series to very preterm infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the benefit of the vaccination is high in these infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed.

## Interference with laboratory testing

Since the Hib capsular polysaccharide antigen is excreted in the urine, a positive urine test can be observed within 1-2 weeks following vaccination. Other tests should be performed in order to confirm Hib infection during this period.

## Excipients with known effect

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Infanrix hexa contains para-aminobenzoic acid. It may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed), and exceptionally, bronchospasm.

The vaccine contains 0.0298 microgram phenylalanine in each dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful if you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the body cannot remove it properly.

The vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'. The vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'potassium-free'.

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Infanrix hexa can be given concomitantly with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7, PCV10 and PCV13), meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine (CRM197 and TT conjugates), meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccine (TT conjugate), meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (MenB), oral rotavirus vaccine and measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine.

Data have shown no clinically relevant interference in the antibody response to each of the individual antigens, although inconsistent antibody response to poliovirus type 2 in co-administration with Synflorix was observed (seroprotection ranging from 78% to 100%) and the immune response rates to the PRP (Hib) antigen of Infanrix hexa after 2 doses given at 2 and 4 months of age were higher if coadministered with a tetanus toxoid conjugate pneumococcal or meningococcal vaccine (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of these observations remains unknown.

When Infanrix hexa was co-administered with MenB and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, inconsistent results were seen across studies for responses to inactivated poliovirus type 2, pneumococcal conjugate serotype 6B antigen and to the pertussis pertactin antigen but these data do not suggest clinically significant interference.

Data from clinical studies indicate that, when Infanrix hexa is co-administered with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, the rate of febrile reactions is higher compared to that occurring following the administration of Infanrix hexa alone. Data from one clinical study indicate that when Infanrix hexa is co-administered with MMRV vaccine, the rate of febrile reactions is higher compared to that occurring following the administration of Infanrix hexa alone and similar to that occurring following the administration of MMRV vaccine alone (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The immune responses were unaffected.

Due to an increased risk of fever, pain at the injection site, loss of appetite and irritability when Infanrix hexa was co-administered with MenB vaccine and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, separate vaccinations can be considered when possible.

As with other vaccines it may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, an adequate response may not be achieved.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

As Infanrix hexa is not intended for use in adults, adequate human data on use during pregnancy or lactation and adequate animal reproduction studies are not available.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Not relevant.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

As has been observed for DTPa and DTPa-containing combinations, an increase in local reactogenicity and fever was reported after booster vaccination with Infanrix hexa with respect to the primary course.

## Tabulated summary of adverse reactions

1 Children primed with acellular pertussis vaccines are more likely to experience swelling reactions after booster administration in comparison with children primed with whole cell vaccines. These reactions resolve over an average of 4 days.

2 Adverse reactions from spontaneous reporting.

## · Experience in co-administration:

Analysis of postmarketing reporting rates suggests a potential increased risk of convulsions (with or without fever) and HHE when comparing groups which reported use of Infanrix hexa with Prevenar 13 to those which reported use of Infanrix hexa alone.

In clinical studies in which some of the vaccinees received Infanrix hexa concomitantly with Prevenar (PCV7) as a booster (4th) dose of both vaccines, fever ≥ 38.0°C was reported in 43.4% of infants receiving Prevenar and Infanrix hexa at the same time as compared to 30.5% of infants receiving the hexavalent vaccine alone. Fever ≥ 39.5°C was observed in 2.6% and 1.5% of infants receiving Infanrix hexa with or without Prevenar, respectively (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). The incidence and severity of fever following co-administration of the two vaccines in the primary series was lower than that observed after the booster dose.

Data from clinical studies show similar incidences of fever when Infanrix hexa is co-administered with other pneumococcal saccharide conjugated vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a clinical study in which some of the vaccinees received a booster dose of Infanrix hexa concomitantly with measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine, fever ≥ 38.0°C was reported in 76.6% of children receiving MMRV vaccine and Infanrix hexa at the same time, as compared to 48% of children receiving Infanrix hexa alone and 74.7% of children receiving MMRV vaccine alone. Fever of greater than 39.5°C was reported in 18% of children receiving Infanrix hexa with MMRV vaccine, as compared to 3.3% of children receiving Infanrix hexa alone and 19.3% of children receiving MMRV alone (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

## · Safety in preterm infants:

Infanrix hexa has been administered to more than 1000 preterm infants (born after a gestation period of 24 to 36 weeks) in primary vaccination studies and in more than 200 preterm infants as a booster dose in the second year of life. In comparative clinical studies, similar rates of symptoms were observed in preterm and full-term infants (refer to section 4.4 for information on apnoea).

## · Safety in infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with dTpa during pregnancy

In two clinical studies, Infanrix hexa has been administered to more than 500 subjects born to mothers vaccinated with dTpa (n=341) or placebo (n=346) during the third trimester of pregnancy (see section 5.1). The safety profile of Infanrix hexa was similar regardless of exposure/non-exposure to dTpa during pregnancy.

## · Experience with hepatitis B vaccine:

In extremely rare cases, allergic reactions mimicking serum sickness, paralysis, neuropathy, neuritis, hypotension, vasculitis, lichen planus, erythema multiforme, arthritis, muscular weakness, GuillainBarré syndrome, encephalopathy, encephalitis and meningitis have been reported. The causal relationship to the vaccine has not been established.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No case of overdose has been reported.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Bacterial and viral vaccines combined, ATC code: J07CA09

## Immunogenicity

The immunogenicity of Infanrix hexa has been evaluated in clinical studies from 6 weeks of age. The vaccine was assessed in 2-dose and 3-dose priming schedules, including the schedule for the Expanded Program on Immunisation, and as a booster dose. The results of these clinical studies are summarised in the tables below.

After a 3-dose primary vaccination schedule, at least 95.7% of infants had developed seroprotective or seropositive antibody levels against each of the vaccine antigens. After booster vaccination (post-dose 4), at least 98.4% of children had developed seroprotective or seropositive antibody levels against each of the vaccine antigens.

N = number of subjects

* in a subgroup of infants not administered hepatitis B vaccine at birth, 77.7% of subjects had anti-HBs titres ≥ 10 mIU/ml

** Post booster, 98.4% of subjects had antiPRP concentration ≥ 1 µ g/ml indicative of long-term protection

† cut-off accepted as indicative of protection

After a 2-dose primary vaccination schedule, at least 84.3% of infants had developed seroprotective or seropositive antibody levels against each of the vaccine antigens. After a complete vaccination according to a 2-dose primary and booster schedule with Infanrix hexa, at least 97.9% of the subjects had developed seroprotective or seropositive antibody levels against each of the vaccine antigens.

According to different studies, immune response to the PRP antigen of Infanrix hexa after 2 doses given at 2 and 4 months of age will vary if co-administered with a tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine. Infanrix hexa will confer an anti-PRP immune response (cutoff ≥ 0.15µg/ml) in at least 84% of the infants. This rises to 88% in case of concomitant use of pneumococcal vaccine containing tetanus toxoid as carrier and to 98% when Infanrix hexa is co-administered with a TT conjugated meningococcal vaccine (see section 4.5).

† cut-off accepted as indicative of protection

* Post booster, 94.4% of subjects in the 2-4-12 months schedule and 97.0% of subjects in the 3-5-11 months schedule had antiPRP concentration ≥ 1 µ g/ml indicative of long-term protection.

Serological correlates of protection have been established for diphtheria, tetanus, polio, hepatitis B and Hib. For pertussis there is no serological correlate of protection. However, as the immune response to pertussis antigens following Infanrix hexa administration is equivalent to that of Infanrix (DTPa), the protective efficacy of the two vaccines is expected to be equivalent.

## Efficacy in protecting against pertussis

The clinical protection of the pertussis component of Infanrix (DTPa), against WHO-defined typical pertussis ( ≥ 21 days of paroxysmal cough) was demonstrated after 3-dose primary immunisation in the studies tabulated below:

| Study                                         | Country   | Schedule     | Vaccine efficacy   | Considerations                                                                                                                                                 |

| Household contact study (prospective blinded) | Germany   | 3,4,5 months | 88.7%              | Based on data collected from secondary contacts in households where there was an index case with typical pertussis                                             |
| Efficacy study (NIH sponsored)                | Italy     | 2,4,6 months | 84%                | In a follow-up of the same cohort, the efficacy was confirmed up to 60 months after completion of primary vaccination without administration of a booster dose |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Persistence of the immune response

The persistence of the immune response to a 3-dose primary (at 2-3-4, 3-4-5 or 2-4-6 months of age) and booster (in the second year of life) schedule with Infanrix hexa was evaluated in children 4-8 years of age. Protective immunity against the three poliovirus types and PRP was observed in at least 91.0% of children and against diphtheria and tetanus in at least 64.7% of children. At least 25.4% (anti-PT), 97.5% (anti-FHA) and 87.0% (anti-PRN) of children were seropositive against the pertussis components.

N = number of subjects

* Samples tested by ELISA to have antidiphtheria antibody concentrations &lt; 0.1 IU/ml were re -tested using Vero-cell neutralisation assay (seroprotection cutoff ≥ 0.016 IU/ml) : 96.5% of the subjects were seroprotected

§ Number of subjects from 2 clinical studies

With regards to hepatitis B, seroprotective antibody concentrations (≥10 mIU/ml) following a 3-dose primary and booster schedule with Infanrix hexa have been shown to persist in ≥ 8 5% of subjects 4-5 years of age, in ≥7 2% of subjects 7-8 years of age, in ≥60% of subjects 12 -13 years of age and in 53.7% of subjects 14-15 years of age. Additionally, following a 2-dose primary and booster schedule, seroprotective antibody concentrations against hepatitis B persisted in ≥ 48% of subjects 11-12 years of age.

Hepatitis B immunological memory was confirmed in children 4 to 15 years of age. These children had received Infanrix hexa as primary and booster vaccination in infancy, and when an additional dose of monovalent HBV vaccine was administered, protective immunity was observed in at least 93% of subjects.

Immunogenicity in infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with dTpa during pregnancy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The immunogenicity of Infanrix hexa in infants and toddlers born to healthy mothers vaccinated with dTpa at 27-36 weeks of pregnancy was evaluated in two clinical studies. Infanrix hexa was co-administered with a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to infants at 2, 4 and 6 months or 2, 3 and 4 months in three-dose primary vaccination schedules (n=241), or at 3 and 5 months or 2 and 4 months in two-dose primary vaccination schedules (n=27); and to the same infants/toddlers from 11 to 18 months as booster dose (n=229).

Post-primary and post-booster vaccination, immunological data did not show clinically relevant interference of maternal vaccination with dTpa on the infant's and toddler's responses to diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, inactivated poliovirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b or pneumococcal antigens.

Lower antibody concentrations against pertussis antigens post-primary (PT, FHA and PRN) and postbooster (PT, FHA) vaccination were observed in infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with dTpa during pregnancy. The fold-increases of anti-pertussis antibody concentrations from the prebooster to the 1-month post-booster time point were in the same range for infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with dTpa or with placebo, demonstrating effective priming of the immune system. In the absence of correlates of protection for pertussis, the clinical relevance of these observations remains to be fully understood. However, current epidemiological data on pertussis disease following the implementation of dTpa maternal immunisation do not suggest any clinical relevance of this immune interference.

## Immunogenicity in preterm infants

The immunogenicity of Infanrix hexa was evaluated across three studies including approximately 300 preterm infants (born after a gestation period of 24 to 36 weeks) following a 3-dose primary vaccination course at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. The immunogenicity of a booster dose at 18 to 24 months of age was evaluated in approximately 200 preterm infants.

One month after primary vaccination at least 98.7% of subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria, tetanus and poliovirus types 1 and 2; at least 90.9% had seroprotective antibody levels against the hepatitis B, PRP and poliovirus type 3 antigens; and all subjects were seropositive for antibodies against FHA and PRN while 94.9% were seropositive for anti-PT antibodies.

One month after the booster dose at least 98.4% of subjects had seroprotective or seropositive antibody levels against each of the antigens except against PT (at least 96.8%) and hepatitis B (at least 88.7%). The response to the booster dose in terms of fold increases in antibody concentrations (15- to 235-fold), indicate that preterm infants were adequately primed for all the antigens of Infanrix hexa.

In a follow-up study conducted in 74 children, approximately 2.5 to 3 years after the booster dose, 85.3% of the children were still seroprotected against hepatitis B and at least 95.7% were seroprotected against the three poliovirus types and PRP.

## Post marketing experience

Results of long-term follow-up in Sweden demonstrate that acellular pertussis vaccines are efficacious in infants when administered according to the 3 and 5 months primary vaccination schedule, with a booster dose administered at approximately 12 months. However, data indicate that protection against pertussis may be waning at 7-8 years of age with this 3-5-12 month's schedule. This suggests that a second booster dose of pertussis vaccine is warranted in children aged 5-7 years who have previously been vaccinated following this particular schedule.

The effectiveness of the Hib component of Infanrix hexa was investigated via an extensive postmarketing surveillance study conducted in Germany. Over a seven-year follow-up period, the effectiveness of the Hib components of two hexavalent vaccines, of which one was Infanrix hexa, was 89.6% for a full primary series and 100% for a full primary series plus booster dose (irrespective of the Hib vaccine used for priming).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results of ongoing routine national surveillance in Italy demonstrate that Infanrix hexa is effective in controlling Hib disease in infants when the vaccine is administered according to the 3 and 5 months primary vaccination schedule, with a booster dose administered at approximately 11 months. Over a six year period starting in 2006, where Infanrix hexa was the principal Hib-containing vaccine in use with vaccination coverage exceeding 95%, Hib invasive disease continued to be well controlled, with four confirmed Hib cases reported in Italian children aged less than 5 years through passive surveillance.

Not all pack sizes may be marketed.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

Upon storage, a clear liquid and white deposit may be observed in the pre-filled syringe containing the DTPa-HBV-IPV suspension. This is a normal observation.

The pre-filled syringe should be well shaken in order to obtain a homogeneous turbid white suspension.

The vaccine is reconstituted by adding the entire contents of the pre-filled syringe to the vial containing the powder. The mixture should be well shaken until the powder is completely dissolved prior to administration.

The reconstituted vaccine appears as a slightly more cloudy suspension than the liquid component alone. This is a normal observation.

The vaccine suspension should be inspected visually before and after reconstitution for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. If either is observed, do not administer the vaccine.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before your child receives this vaccine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
- This vaccine has been prescribed for your child only. Do not pass it on to others.
- If your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Infanrix hexa is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before your child receives Infanrix hexa
3. How Infanrix hexa is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Infanrix hexa
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Infanrix hexa is and what it is used for

Infanrix hexa is a vaccine used to protect your child against six diseases:

- Diphtheria: a serious bacterial infection that mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin, causing serious breathing problems, sometimes suffocation. The bacteria also release a poison. This can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and even death.
- Tetanus : tetanus bacteria commonly found in soil, dust, horse manure and wood splinters enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds in the skin, and release a poison. This can cause muscle stiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and even death.
- Whooping cough (Pertussis) : a highly contagious bacterial infection that affects the airways, causing a long-lasting cough, which often has a 'whooping' sound. It can also cause ear infections, chest infections (bronchitis), lung infections (pneumonia), fits, brain damage and even death.
- Hepatitis B: is caused by the hepatitis B virus, which attacks the liver. The virus can cause lifelong infection and may lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer.
- Polio: a viral infection, sometimes causing nerve injury and permanent damage, which can make the muscles unable to move (paralysis), including the muscles needed for breathing and walking. It can cause permanent damage or even death.
- Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) : a bacterial infection. It can cause meningitis (brain inflammation), which can lead to mental slowness (retardation), cerebral palsy, deafness, epilepsy or partial blindness. It can also cause swelling of the throat causing death by suffocation. It can also infect the blood, heart, lungs, bones, joints and tissues of the eyes and mouth.

## How Infanrix hexa works

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Infanrix hexa helps your child's body make its own protection (antibodies). This will protect your child against these diseases.
- As with all vaccines, Infanrix hexa may not fully protect all children who are vaccinated.
- The vaccine cannot cause the diseases that it protects your child from.

## 2. What you need to know before your child receives Infanrix hexa

## Infanrix hexa should not be given

- if your child is allergic to:
- Infanrix hexa or any of the ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6).
- formaldehyde.
- neomycin or polymyxin (antibiotics).

Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin, rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue.

- if your child has had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis B, polio or Haemophilus influenzae type b.
- if your child has had problems of the nervous system within 7 days after previous vaccination with a vaccine against whooping cough
- if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C).

A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first.

Infanrix hexa should not be given if any of the above apply to your child. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before your child is given Infanrix hexa.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before your child is given Infanrix hexa:

- if after previously having Infanrix hexa or another vaccine against whooping cough, your child had any problems, especially:
- a high temperature (over 40°C) within 48 hours of vaccination
- a collapse or 'shock-like' state within 48 hours of vaccination
- persistent crying lasting 3 hours or more within 48 hours of vaccination
- fits with or without a high temperature within 3 days of vaccination
- if your child has an undiagnosed or progressive disease of the brain or epilepsy which is not controlled. After control of the disease the vaccine can be given.
- if your child has a bleeding problem or bruises easily
- if your child tends to have fits when they have a fever, or if there is a history of this in the family.
- if your child should become unresponsive or experience seizures (fits) after the vaccination, please contact your doctor immediately. See also section 4 Possible side effects.
- if your baby was born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal between breaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination. These babies may require respiratory monitoring for 48-72 h following the administration of the first two or three doses of Infanrix hexa.

If any of the above apply to your child (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before your child is given Infanrix hexa.

## Other medicines and Infanrix hexa

Your doctor may ask you to give your child a medicine that lowers fever (such as paracetamol) before or immediately after Infanrix hexa is given. This can help to lower some of the side effects (febrile reactions) of Infanrix hexa.

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken, might take any other medicines or has recently received any other vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Infanrix hexa contains neomycin, polymyxin, para-aminobenzoic acid, phenylalanine, sodium and potassium

This vaccine contains neomycin and polymyxin (antibiotics). Tell your doctor if your child has had an allergic reaction to these ingredients.

Infanrix hexa contains para-aminobenzoic acid. It may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed), and exceptionally, bronchospasm.

The vaccine contains 0.0298 microgram phenylalanine in each dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful if you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the body cannot remove it properly.

The vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'. The vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'potassium-free'.

## 3. How Infanrix hexa is given

## How much is given

- Your child will have a total of two or three injections with respectively at least 2 or 1 month(s) between each injection.
- You will be told by the doctor or nurse when your child should come back for their next injections.
- If additional injections (boosters) are necessary, the doctor will tell you.

## How the vaccine is given

- Infanrix hexa will be given as an injection into a muscle.
- The vaccine should never be given into a blood vessel or into the skin.

## If your child misses a dose

- If your child misses an injection which is due, it is important that you make another appointment.
- Make sure your child finishes the complete vaccination course. If not, your child may not be fully protected against the diseases.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The following side effects may happen with this vaccine:

## Allergic reactions

If your child has an allergic reaction, see your doctor straight away. The signs may include:

- rashes that may be itchy or blistering
- swelling of the eyes and face
- difficulty in breathing or swallowing
- a sudden drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness.

These signs usually start very soon after the injection has been given. Talk to a doctor straight away if they happen after leaving the doctor's surgery.

## See your doctor straight away if your child has any of the following serious side effects:

- collapse
- times when they lose consciousness or have a lack of awareness
- fits - with or without fever

These side effects have happened very rarely with Infanrix hexa as with other vaccines against whooping cough. They usually happen within 2 to 3 days after vaccination.

## Other side effects include:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Very common (these may occur with more than 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine): sleepiness, loss of appetite, high temperature of 38°C or higher, swelling, pain, redness where the injection was given, unusual crying, feeling irritable or restless.

Common (these may occur with up to 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine): diarrhoea, being sick (vomiting), high temperature of more than 39.5°C, swelling larger than 5 cm or hard lump where the injection was given, feeling nervous.

Uncommon (these may occur with up to 1 in 100 doses of the vaccine): upper respiratory tract infection, tiredness, cough, large swelling at the injected limb.

Rare (these may occur with up to 1 in 1,000 doses of the vaccine): bronchitis, rash, swollen glands in the neck, armpit or groin (lymphadenopathy), bleeding or bruising more easily than normal (thrombocytopenia), in babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal between breaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination, temporarily stopping breathing (apnoea), swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing (angioedema), swelling of the whole injected limb, blisters.

Very rare (these may happen with up to 1 in 10,000 doses of the vaccine): itching (dermatitis).

## Experience with hepatitis B vaccine

In extremely rare cases the following side effects have been reported with hepatitis B vaccine: paralysis, numbness or weakness of the arms and legs (neuropathy), inflammation of some nerves, possibly with pins and needles or loss of feeling or normal movement (Guillain-Barré syndrome), swelling or infection of the brain (encephalopathy, encephalitis), infection around the brain (meningitis). The causal relationship to the vaccine has not been established.

Bleeding or bruising more easily than normal (thrombocytopenia) has been reported with hepatitis B vaccines.

## Reporting of side effects

If your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.

## 5. How to store Infanrix hexa

- Keep this vaccine out of the sight and reach of children.
- Do not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.
- Store in a refrigerator (2 ° C - 8 ° C).
- Store in the original package in order to protect from light.
- Do not freeze. Freezing destroys the vaccine.
- Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines your child no longer uses. These measures will help protect the environment.

## The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

Upon storage, a clear liquid and white deposit may be observed in the pre-filled syringe containing the DTPa-HBV-IPV suspension. This is a normal observation.

The pre-filled syringe should be well shaken in order to obtain a homogeneous turbid white suspension.

The vaccine is reconstituted by adding the entire contents of the pre-filled syringe to the vial containing the powder. The mixture should then be well shaken until the powder is completely dissolved prior to administration.

The reconstituted vaccine appears as a slightly more cloudy suspension than the liquid component alone. This is a normal observation.

The vaccine suspension should be inspected visually before and after reconstitution for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. If either is observed, do not administer the vaccine.
