## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Theralugand 40 GBq/mL radiopharmaceutical precursor, solution

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

1 mL solution contains 40 GBq lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride on activity reference time (ART), corresponding to maximum 10 micrograms of lutetium ( 177 Lu) (as chloride).

The ART is set on the scheduled day of radiolabelling as indicated by the customer and can be up to 10 days starting from the day of manufacture.

Each 3 mL vial contains an activity ranging from 4 to 120 GBq at ART. The volume is 0.1 to 3 mL.

Each 10 mL vial contains an activity ranging from 12 to 200 GBq at ART. The volume is 0.3 to 5 mL.

The specific activity of the radiopharmaceutical precursor solution at ART is greater than 3 000 GBq/mg.

The non carrier added (n.c.a.) radionuclide lutetium ( 177 Lu) is produced by neutron irradiation of highly enriched ( ≥ 99%) ytterbium ( 176 Yb) leading to the following nuclear reaction:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) is then chemically separated from the irradiated target material in a chromatographic process.

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) has a half-life of 6.647 days. It decays by emission of beta radiation to stable hafnium ( 177 Hf). Besides medium-energy beta (β -) particles, imageable low-energy gamma photons are also emitted thereby. The main radiation emissions of lutetium ( 177 Lu) are shown in Table 1.

Table 1: Lutetium ( 177 Lu) principal radiation emission data

| Radiation   |   Energy (keV)* |   Abundance (%) |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Beta (β - ) |           47.23 |           11.66 |
| Beta (β - ) |          111.2  |            8.89 |
| Beta (β - ) |          148.84 |           79.44 |

Clear colourless solution.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Theralugand is a radiopharmaceutical precursor, and it is not intended for direct use in patients. It is to be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules that have been specifically developed and authorised for radiolabelling with lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Theralugand is only to be used by specialists experienced with in vitro radiolabelling.

## Posology

The quantity of Theralugand required for radiolabelling and the quantity of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal product that is subsequently administered will depend on the medicinal product to be radiolabelled and its intended use. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

## Paediatric population

For more information concerning paediatric use of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

## Method of administration

Theralugand is intended for in vitro radiolabelling of medicinal products which are subsequently administered by the approved route.

Theralugand should not be administered directly to the patient.

For instructions on preparation of the radiopharmaceutical precursor solution before administration, see section 12.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.6).

For information on contraindications to particular lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with Theralugand, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Individual benefit/risk justification

For each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity administered should in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required therapeutic effect.

Theralugand is not to be administered directly to the patient but must be used for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides, vitamins, or other substrates.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment and haematological disorders

Careful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation exposure is possible. It is recommended to perform individual radiation dosimetry assessments of specific organs, which may not be the target organ of therapy.

## Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) have been observed after treatment with lutetium ( 177 Lu)-based peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours (see section 4.8). This should be taken into account when considering the benefit/risk, especially in patients with possible risk factors like prior exposure to chemotherapeutic agents (such as alkylating agents).

## Myelosuppression

Anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, lymphopenia, and less commonly neutropenia may occur during radioligand therapy with lutetium ( 177 Lu). Most events are mild and transient, but in some cases, patients have required blood and platelet transfusions. In some patients more than one cell line may be affected and pancytopenia requiring treatment discontinuation has been described. A blood count should be taken at baseline and monitored regularly during treatment, in accordance with clinical guidance.

## Renal irradiation

Radiolabelled somatostatin analogues are excreted by the kidney. Radiation nephropathy has been reported following peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours using other radioisotopes. Renal function including glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should be assessed at baseline and during treatment and renal protection should be considered, in accordance with clinical guidance of the radiolabelled medicinal product.

## Hepatotoxicity

Cases of hepatotoxicity have been reported in the post-marketing setting and in the literature in patients with liver metastases undergoing treatment with lutetium ( 177 Lu)-based peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours. Liver function should be monitored regularly during treatment. Dose reduction may be necessary in affected patients.

## Hormone release syndromes

There have been reports of carcinoid crisis and other syndromes associated with release of hormones from functional neuroendocrine tumours following lutetium ( 177 Lu)-based peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, which may be related to irradiation of tumour cells. Reported symptoms include flushing and diarrhoea associated with hypotension. Observation of patients by overnight hospitalisation should be considered in some cases (e.g., patients with poor pharmacologic control of symptoms). In case of hormonal crises, treatments may include: intravenous high dose somatostatin analogues, intravenous fluids, corticosteroids, and correction of electrolyte disturbances in patients with diarrhoea and/or vomiting.

## Tumour lysis syndrome

Tumour lysis syndrome has been reported following lutetium ( 177 Lu) radioligand therapy. Patients with a history of renal insufficiency and high tumour burden may be at greater risk and should be treated with increased caution. Renal function as well as electrolyte balance should be assessed at baseline and during treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Extravasation

There have been reports of extravasation of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled ligands in the post-marketing setting. In case of extravasation, infusion of the lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal product should be immediately ceased, and the nuclear medicine physician and the radiopharmacist should be promptly informed. Management should be in accordance with local protocols.

## Radiation protection

Point-source approximation shows that the average dose rate experienced 20 hours after administration of a 7.4 GBq dose of a lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal product (residual radioactivity 1.5 GBq) by a person at 1 meter distance from the patient's body centre with an abdominal radius of 15 cm is 3.5 µSv/h. Doubling the distance to the patient to 2 meters reduces the dose rate by a factor of 4 to 0.9 µSv/h. The same dose in a patient with an abdominal radius of 25 cm yields a dose rate at 1 meter of 2.6 µSv/h. The generally accepted threshold for discharge of the treated patient from the hospital is 20 µSv/h. In most countries, the exposure limit for hospital staff is set the same as for the general public at 1 mSv/year. When taking the 3.5 µSv/h dose rate as an average, this would allow hospital staff to work approx. 300 hours/year in close vicinity of patients treated with lutetium ( 177 Lu)labelled medicinal products without wearing radiation protection. Of course, the nuclear medicine staff is expected to wear standard radiation protection.

Any other person in close vicinity of the treated patient should be informed about possibilities to reduce his/her exposure due to radiation emitted from the patient.

## Specific warnings

For information concerning special warnings and special precautions for use of lutetium ( 177 Lu)labelled medicinal products refer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

Further precautions with respect to relatives, carers and hospital staff are provided in section 6.6.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies of lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride with other medicinal products have been performed.

For information concerning interactions associated with the use of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

When an administration of radiopharmaceuticals to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is important to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should be assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the woman has missed a period, if the period is very irregular, etc.), alternative techniques not using ionising radiation (if there are any) should be offered to the patient. Before the use of lutetium ( 177 Lu)labelled medicinal products, pregnancy should be excluded using an adequate/validated test.

## Pregnancy

The use of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products is contraindicated during established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded due to the risk of ionising radiation to the foetus (see section 4.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

Before administering radiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breast-feeding, consideration should be given to the possibility of delaying the administration of radionuclide until the mother has ceased breast-feeding, and to what is the most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind the secretion of activity in breast milk. If the administration is considered necessary, breast-feeding should be interrupted and the expressed feeds discarded.

## Fertility

Effects of lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride on male and female fertility have not been studied in animals. Low exposures could be demonstrated for male and female sexual organs. It cannot be excluded that lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products lead to reproductive toxicity including spermatogenetic damage in male testes or genetic damage in male testes or female ovaries.

Further information concerning fertility as well as the use of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products in women of childbearing potential, during pregnancy and breast-feeding will be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Effects on ability to drive and to use machines following treatment by lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products will be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Adverse reactions following the administration of a lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal product prepared by radiolabelling with Theralugand will be dependent on the specific medicinal product being used. Such information will be supplied in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of hereditary defects. The radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer and mutations. In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation are less than from the disease itself.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions are divided into groups according to the MedDRA convention frequencies: Very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000), very rare (&lt; 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Dry mouth

Transient dryness of the mouth has been reported among patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer receiving PSMA-targeting lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products.

## Alopecia

Alopecia, described as mild and temporary, has been observed among patients receiving lutetium ( 177 Lu)-based peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

The presence of free lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride in the body after an inadvertent administration of Theralugand will lead to increased bone marrow toxicity and haematopoietic stem cell damage. Therefore, in case of an inadvertent administration of Theralugand, the radiotoxicity for the patient must be reduced by immediate (i.e., within 1 hour) administration of preparations containing chelators like Ca-DTPA or Ca-EDTA in order to increase the elimination of the radionuclide from the body.

The following preparations must be available in medical institutions, which use Theralugand for labelling of carrier molecules for therapeutic purposes:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Ca-DTPA (trisodium calcium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) or
- Ca-EDTA (calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate)

These chelating agents help with the elimination of lutetium ( 177 Lu) radiotoxicity by an exchange between the calcium ion in the complex and the lutetium ( 177 Lu) ion. Due to the capacity of the chelating ligands (DTPA, EDTA) of forming water soluble complexes, the complexes and bound lutetium ( 177 Lu) are rapidly eliminated by the kidneys.

One gram of the chelating agents should be administered by slow intravenous injection over 3 4 minutes or by infusion (1 g in 100 - 250 mL of glucose, or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection).

The chelating efficacy is greatest immediately or within one hour of exposure when the radionuclide is circulating in or available to tissue fluids and plasma. However, a post-exposure interval &gt; 1 hour does not preclude the administration and effective action of chelator with reduced efficiency. Intravenous administration should not be protracted over more than 2 hours.

In any case, the blood parameters of the patient have to be monitored and the appropriate actions immediately taken if there is evidence of radiotoxicity.

The toxicity of free lutetium ( 177 Lu) due to in vivo release from the labelled biomolecule in the body during therapy could be reduced by post-administration of chelating agents.

## 5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, other therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, ATC code: V10X

The pharmacodynamic properties of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) emits beta (β -) particles of moderate maximum energy (0.498 MeV) with a maximum tissue penetration of approximately 2 mm. Lutetium ( 177 Lu) also emits low-energy gamma-rays which allow scintigraphic, biodistribution and dosimetry studies with the same lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of the studies with Theralugand in all subsets of the paediatric population on grounds that the specific medicinal product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for paediatric patients. This waiver does however not extend to any therapeutic uses of the medicinal product when linked to a carrier molecule (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetic properties of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Distribution after inadvertent intravenous administration of lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride

Rapid absorption was observed upon intravenous administration of 30 MBq lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride to rats, with the peak of lutetium ( 177 Lu) concentration in blood plasma reached within 12 min postinjection. Overall, the highest lutetium ( 177 Lu) uptake was detected in spleen, liver, and bone. In particular, at 1-hour post-injection, lutetium ( 177 Lu) predominantly accumulated in spleen and liver, reaching the highest values in these organs at day 2 in male and day 7 in female rats. Prominent accumulation in bone occurred at 12-hours post-injection and further increased unsteadily up to day 35, obviously partly counteracted by the radioactive decay. Distribution of lutetium ( 177 Lu) to reproductive organs was rather low at all analysed post-injection time points.

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) excretion occurred mainly via urine, with some faecal excretion observed.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

The toxicological properties of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride prior to administration will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

The toxicity of non-radioactive lutetium chloride has been studied in different mammalian species and using different administration routes. The intraperitoneal LD50 in mice was found to be approximately 315 mg/kg. In cats, no pharmacological effects on respiration and cardiovascular function were observed up to a cumulative intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg. A high dose of 10 GBq of lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride contains 2.4 μg lutetium, corresponding to a human dose of 0.034 μg/kg. This dose is approximately 7 orders of magnitude lower than the intraperitoneal LD50 in mice and more than 5 orders of magnitude lower than the NOEL observed in cats. Therefore, lutetium metal-ion toxicity of Theralugand-labelled medicinal products can be excluded.

## 6.  PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS

## 6.1 List of excipients

Diluted hydrochloric acid

## 6.2 Incompatibilities

Radiolabelling of medicinal products, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides, vitamins or other substrates, with lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride is very sensitive to the presence of trace metal impurities.

It is important that all glassware, syringe needles etc., used for the preparation of the lutetium ( 177 Lu)labelled medicinal product are thoroughly cleaned to ensure freedom from such trace metal impurities. Only syringe needles (for example, non-metallic) with proven resistance to dilute acid should be used to minimise trace metal impurity levels.

In the absence of compatibility studies, this radiopharmaceutical precursor solution must not be mixed with medicinal products other than the medicinal products to be radiolabelled.

## 6.3 Shelf life

Up to 10 days from the date of manufacture.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Shelf life after first opening

From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of withdrawal from the vial or any insertion into the vial preclude the risk of microbial contamination, the radiopharmaceutical precursor solution should be used immediately.

If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user.

## 6.4 Special precautions for storage

Store in the original package in order to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure.

Storage of radiopharmaceutical precursor solution should be in accordance with national regulation on radioactive materials.

This radiopharmaceutical precursor solution does not require any special temperature storage conditions.

## 6.5 Nature and contents of container

Colourless type I glass 3 mL vial with a V-shaped bottom or a colourless type I glass 10 mL vial with a flat bottom, closed with bromobutyl rubber stopper and aluminium crimp cap.

The vials are placed into a lead container with acrylic insert for protective shielding and packed in a metallic can and an outer carton.

Pack size: 1 vial.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

Theralugand is not intended for direct use in patients.

## General warning

Radiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in designated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and/or appropriate licences of the competent official organisation.

Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken.

For instructions on extemporary preparation of the radiopharmaceutical precursor solution before administration, see section 12.

If at any time in the preparation of this radiopharmaceutical precursor solution the integrity of this container is compromised it should not be used.

Administration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the radiopharmaceutical precursor solution and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory.

The surface dose rates and the accumulated dose depend on many factors. Measurements on the location and during work are critical and should be practiced for more precise and instructive determination of overall radiation dose to the staff. Healthcare personnel are advised to limit the time of close contact with patients injected with lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled radiopharmaceuticals. The use of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

television monitor systems to monitor the patients is recommended. Given the long half-life of lutetium ( 177 Lu), it is specially recommended to avoid internal contamination. For this reason, it is mandatory to use protective high quality (latex/nitrile) gloves in any direct contact with the radiopharmaceutical (vial/syringe) and with the patient. For minimising radiation exposure resulting from repeated exposition there is no recommendation except the strict observance of the above ones.

The administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or contamination from spill of urine, vomiting, etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with national regulations must therefore be taken.

Any unused radiopharmaceutical precursor solution or waste material must be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## 11. DOSIMETRY

The radiation dose received by various organs following intravenous administration of a lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled radiopharmaceutical is dependent on the specific molecule being radiolabelled.

Information on radiation dosimetry of each different lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal product following administration of the radiolabelled preparation is available in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

The dosimetry tables below are presented in order to evaluate the contribution of non-conjugated lutetium ( 177 Lu) to the radiation dose following the administration of a lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal product or resulting from an accidental intravenous injection of Theralugand.

The dosimetry estimates are extrapolated from a rat distribution study. Single dose of 30 MBq Theralugand was used in the study. Post-injection time points for measurements were 5 min, 1 h, 12 h, 2 days, 7 days, and 35 days. Organ absorbed radiation doses (mGy/MBq) listed below for adult, 15year, 10-year, 5-year, 1-year and newborn male and female human models are derived from the distribution data in rats using IDAC-Dose 2.1 v1.01 (for adults) and OLINDA/EXM v1.0 (for children and adolescents) software. Sex-specific effective dose coefficients (mSv/MBq) were calculated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

according to ICRP 60 (International Commission on Radiological Protection) provisions. The adult sex-averaged effective dose coefficient for accidentally injected lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride, calculated according to ICRP 103 provisions, lays at 0.19 mSv/MBq.

In case of an accidental direct injection of lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride, the organs with the highest absorbed doses based on rat data would be liver, spleen, bone, and kidneys.

## 12. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS

Before use, packaging and radioactivity should be checked. Activity may be measured using an ionisation chamber.

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) is a beta ( β )/gamma emitter. Activity measurements using an ionisation chamber are very sensitive to geometric factors and therefore should be performed only under geometric conditions which have been appropriately validated.

Usual precautions regarding sterility and radioactivity should be respected.

Withdrawals should be performed under aseptic conditions. The vials must not be opened before disinfecting the stopper, the radiopharmaceutical precursor solution should be withdrawn via the stopper using a single dose syringe fitted with suitable protective shielding and a disposable sterile needle or using an authorised automated application system.

If the integrity of the vial is compromised, the radiopharmaceutical precursor solution should not be used.

The complexing agent and other reagents should be added to the vial with lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride.

Free lutetium ( 177 Lu) is taken up and accumulates in the bones. This could potentially result in osteosarcomas. It is recommended to add a chelating agent such as DTPA prior to intravenous administration of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled radiopharmaceuticals in order to form a complex with free lutetium ( 177 Lu), if such is present, leading to its rapid renal clearance.

Adequate quality control of the radiochemical purity of ready to use radiopharmaceuticals gained after radiolabelling with Theralugand should be assured. Limits for radiochemical impurities should be set recognising the radiotoxicological potential of lutetium ( 177 Lu). Free non-bound lutetium ( 177 Lu) should be consequently minimised.

6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Theralugand is and what it is used for

This medicine is a type of product called a radiopharmaceutical precursor. It contains the active substance lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride which gives off beta-minus radiation.

Theralugand is not intended to be used on its own, but has to be combined with other medicines (so called carrier medicines) before it can be used. This process, where a carrier medicine is tagged with a radioactive compound, is called radiolabelling.

Carrier medicines are used with a specific compound, in this case lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride, to achieve a specific goal. They may be substances that have been designed to recognise a particular type of cell in the body. When such a lutetium ( 177 Lu)-radiolabelled carrier medicine is given to the patient, it carries the radiation to where these cells are located, to treat a disease or to obtain images on a screen that are used to diagnose or locate an illness.

The use of a 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicine does involve exposure to radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit of using a 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicine outweighs the risk due to radiation.

For more information, refer to the package leaflet of the 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicine.

## 2. What you need to know before Theralugand is used

## Theralugand must not be used

- -if you are allergic to lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6);
- -if you are pregnant or believe you may be pregnant.

For more information, refer to the package leaflet of the 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride is not to be administered directly to patients. Of course, the hospital staff is expected to wear standard radiation protection. Any other person in close contact of the treated patient should be informed about possibilities to reduce their exposure due to radiation coming from the patient.

Take special care with the 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicines:

- -if you have kidney problems or a haematological condition (problems with your blood or blood-forming tissue, such as bone marrow). Increased exposure to radiation is possible in patients with these conditions leading to a greater risk of certain side effects (see section 4. Possible side effects). Your doctor will consider the expected benefits of the medicine against the possible risks and may stop treatment if certain side effects occur.
- -a reduced number of red blood cells (anaemia);
- -a reduced number of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia), which are important to stop bleeding;
- -a reduced number of white blood cells (leucopenia, lymphopenia or neutropenia) which are important for protecting the body against infection.

Most of these events are mild and temporary. A reduced number of all 3 types of blood cells (red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells - pancytopenia) has been described in some patients. Treatment has to be stopped in patients with pancytopenia.

Because lutetium ( 177 Lu) can sometimes affect your blood cells, your doctor will do blood tests before you start and at regular intervals during treatment. Talk to your doctor if you experience shortness of breath, bruising, nose bleeds, bleeding from your gums, or if you develop a fever.

When lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride is used to radiolabel carrier medicines called somatostatin analogues applied to treat cancers called neuroendocrine tumours, the radiolabelled carrier medicine is excreted by the kidneys. Your doctor will therefore take a blood test to measure your kidney function before you start and during treatment.

Treatment with 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicines may affect the way your liver works. In this case, you may experience some of the following symptoms: yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), belly (abdominal) pain (especially in the upper right side of your abdomen), feeling sick / nauseous, vomiting, tiredness, loss of appetite, dark urine, and bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. Your doctor will take a blood test to check your liver function during treatment.

Lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled carrier medicines may be given directly into a vein through a tube known as a cannula. There have been reports of leakage of the fluid into the surrounding tissue (extravasation). Tell your doctor if you get any swelling or pain in your arm.

After neuroendocrine tumours are treated with 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicines, you may get symptoms associated with release of hormones from the tumour cells, known as a carcinoid crisis. Tell your doctor if you feel faint or dizzy or have flushing (sudden reddening of the skin, usually on the face or neck) or diarrhoea following your treatment.

Treatment with 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicines may cause tumour lysis syndrome, a condition resulting from the rapid breakdown of tumour cells. This may lead to abnormal blood test results, irregular heartbeat, kidney failure or seizures within a week of treatment. Your doctor will carry out blood tests to monitor you for this syndrome. Tell your doctor if you have muscle cramping, muscle weakness, confusion, or shortness of breath.

Please refer to the package leaflet of the 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicine for additional warnings and precautions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Children and adolescents

Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor if you are under 18 years old.

177 Lu-radiolabelled medicine may be used in children and adolescents under 18 years old. Please refer to the package leaflet of that medicine.

## Other medicines and medicines radiolabelled with Theralugand

Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines since they may interfere with the procedure.

It is not known whether lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride may interact with other medicines as specific studies have not been carried out.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

You must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before you are given 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicines if there is a possibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breastfeeding.

When in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.

If you are pregnant

177 Lu-radiolabelled medicines must not be administered if you are pregnant.

## If you are breast-feeding

You will be asked to stop breast-feeding during treatment with 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicines. Please ask your nuclear medicine doctor when you can resume breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

There could be effects on your ability to drive and to use machines due to the 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicine. Please read the package leaflet of that medicine carefully.

## 3. How the medicine radiolabelled with Theralugand is used

There are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceuticals. 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicines will only be used in special controlled areas. This medicine will only be handled and given to you by people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special care for the safe use of this medicine and will keep you informed of their actions.

The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of a 177 Luradiolabelled medicine to be used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to achieve the appropriate outcome, depending on the 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicine you will be given and what it is used for.

## Administration of the medicine radiolabelled with Theralugand and conduct of the procedure

Theralugand must be used only in combination with another medicine (carrier medicine), which has been specifically developed and authorised for being combined (radiolabelled) with lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride. The way this is given to you will depend on the type of the carrier medicine. Please read the package leaflet of that medicine.

## Duration of the procedure

Your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure.

## After administration of the medicine radiolabelled with Theralugand

The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after receiving the 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you have been given more medicine radiolabelled with Theralugand than you should

Since the 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicine is handled by a nuclear medicine doctor under strictly controlled conditions, there is only a very small chance of possible overdose. However, in the case of an overdose, you will receive appropriate treatment as necessary.

Should you have any further questions on the use of the 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicine, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who supervises the procedure.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, the 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

## Some side effects could be serious.

If you experience any of the following serious side effects, tell your doctor right away.

## Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):

- -Decreased levels of red blood cells (anaemia)
- -Decreased levels of white blood cells (leucopenia)
- -Decreased levels of lymphocytes, another type of white blood cell (lymphopenia)
- -Decreased levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia)

## Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):

- -A type of cancer where the bone marrow does not make enough healthy blood cells or platelets (myelodysplastic syndrome)
- -Decreased levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cells (neutropenia)

## Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):

- -A fast-growing cancer in which too many myeloblasts (a type of immature white blood cell) are found in the bone marrow and blood (acute myeloid leukaemia)

## Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data):

- -Carcinoid crisis
- Carcinoid crisis is a combination of symptoms caused by the release of serotonin and other substances from carcinoid tumours. Symptoms may include flushing of the face, flat angiomas (small collections of dilated blood vessels) of the skin, diarrhoea, difficulty breathing, rapid pulse, and sudden drops in blood pressure causing dizziness and light headedness.
- -Tumour lysis syndrome
- Tumour lysis syndrome is a condition when tumour cells break down and release their contents into the bloodstream, which can damage organs such as the heart, kidneys and liver. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, weakness, tiredness, muscle cramps, seizures, or changes in urine output.
- -A reduced number of red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells (pancytopenia)

Bone marrow cancers (myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia) have been reported in patients several years after treatment with lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled carrier medicines for neuroendocrine tumours.

## Other possible side effects

## Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):

- -Feeling sick (nausea)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Vomiting
- -Mild temporary hair loss (alopecia)

Alopecia has been reported among patients receiving lutetium ( 177 Lu)-based peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours (tumours that form from cells that release hormones into the blood in response to a signal from the nervous system)

## Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data):

- -Dry mouth (reported among patients with prostate cancer receiving treatment with lutetium ( 177 Lu) and has been temporary)

After a 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicine is given, it will deliver certain amounts of ionising radiation (radioactivity), which means there is a risk of cancer and development of hereditary defects. In all cases, the risk of the radiation is outweighed by the potential benefit of receiving the radiolabelled medicine.

For more information, refer to the package leaflet of the 177 Lu-radiolabelled medicine.

## Reporting of side effects

If you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.
