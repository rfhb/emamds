## Introduction

Adalimumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody containing human peptide  sequences  that  binds  to  human  Tumor  Necrosis  Factor  (TNF)  alpha  and  neutralises  the biological  function  of  TNF α by  blocking  its  interaction  with  the  p55  and  p75  cell  surface  TNF α receptors.

Adalimumab is currently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and Crohn's disease (CD).

The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) applied for an extension of the therapeutic indication to include treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), in children and adolescents aged  4  to  17  years  who  had  had  an  inadequate  response  to  one  or  more  disease  modifying  antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The MAH presented the results of the JIA clinical trial to demonstrate adalimumab's safety and efficacy in this population.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an autoimmune disease with a complex genetic predisposition that has been  observed  in  children  under  the  age  of  16  years.  It  is  the  most  common  rheumatic  disease  of childhood and a cause of disability in children with an incidence of 15 per 100,000, 2.5 times more common in females (North America and European populations).

In the progression of inflammatory synovitis (an inflammation of the synovial membrane, a layer of tissue that lines a joint) and articular matrix degradation the two cytokines (molecules produced by the immune system, e.g.  during  an  inflammatory  reaction),  TNFα and  interleukin  (IL)-1  are  involved. When TNFα is  inhibited,  the  levels  of  other  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  are  also  reduced,  such  as IL-1 and IL-6. TNFα is elevated in serum, synovial fluid, and synovial tissue of children with JIA.

The MAH proposed to amend the text of the summary of product characteristics (SPC) sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, and to update the package leaflet (PL) accordingly.

## Clinical aspects

To support the variation application the MAH presented one pivotal study; DE038; where adalimumab was  studied  in  paediatric  subjects  with  polyarticular  JIA,  who  were  either  MTX-naïve,  inadequate responders or intolerant to MTX.

## Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics 1

The pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of adalimumab were evaluated in paediatric (4 - 17 years) subjects with polyarticular JIA in study DE038. In the 16-week open-label lead-in (OL LI) phase and the  32-week  double-blind  (DB)  phase  the  dosing  regimen  was  24  mg  per  m 2 (max  40  mg) sc (subcutaneously) eow, with or without concomitant methotrexate (MTX). The open-label extension comprised the same dosing based on body surface area (OLE BSA) and a period with fixed dosing (OLE FD) treatment (20 mg for subjects with body weights &lt; 30 kg and 40 mg for subjects with body weights &gt;30 kg).

The average (SD) serum concentrations observed in the OL LI and DB phases (average from all time points  measured  during  weeks  20  to  48)  in  adalimumab  treated  patients  were  10.9 (5.2) μ g/ml  and 5.5 (5.6) μ g/ml in patients with and without MTX, respectively. The inter-individual variability was very  large,  in  particular  in  patients  without  concomitant  MTX  treatment.  Comparative  data  (adult versus  juvenile)  on  drug  exposure  was  provided  and  it  appeared  that  the  serum  concentrations  in subjects with JIA were within the range of those previously observed in adult subjects, both during monotherapy  and  concomitant  MTX  treatment.  There  was  a  tendency  for  a  higher  inter-individual

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

variability  and  higher  immunogenicity rate in juvenile subjects compared with. During concomitant MTX treatment the serum levels were on average higher and the variability was lower.

One-hundred and six patients completed the OLE BSA phase and entered the OLE FD phase, in which serum  concentrations  of  adalimumab  were  measured  only  in  patients  who  had  their  dose  changed (N=56). When the dose was increased based on the fixed dose regimen serum concentrations increased (as expected) with individual values ranging from 0 to 30.7 μ g/ml. For the patients where the dose was decreased it was not possible to draw any conclusions based on the very sparse data.

A population pharmacokinetic model was developed on the basis of data from juvenile (DE038) and adult (DE011 and DE009) patients with RA, with the purpose to assess pharmacokinetic differences between  adults  and  children.  However,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  at  present  a  conclusion  of  no difference  in  the  pharmacokinetics  between  adults  and  juvenile  subjects  cannot  be  drawn,  due  to deficiencies  in  the  analysis.  Further,  on  the  basis  of  juvenile  data  only  (DE038),  a  population pharmacokinetic analysis and clinical trial simulations were conducted to support the appropriateness of the proposed fixed dose regimen, since the controlled part of the study was conducted with BSA dosing.  Several  deficiencies  were  identified  in  the  modelling  and  simulation  activities  and  the pharmacokinetic documentation did not contribute in the assessment of safety and efficacy of the fixed dosing strategy. The quantitative assessment of the simulations, e.g. 5 th , median and 95 th percentiles of various age groups, was not considered appropriate as the population model did not appear to fit to the data and the predictiveness of the model was not assessed properly.

## Immunogenicity

Only  samples with low adalimumab  concentrations (&lt;2 microg/ml) were analysed for antiadalimumab antibodies (AAA).

Twenty-seven subjects (16%) had at least one AAA positive observation during the OL LI and DB phases,  whereof  5  (6%)  and  22  (26%)  with  and  without  MTX,  respectively.  The  incidence  of antibodies  was  higher  in  juvenile  subjects  on  monotherapy,  compared  with  adults  on  monotherapy, while there was no obvious difference in the antibody incidence between juvenile and adult subjects on concomitant MTX.

In  all  phases,  the  overall  proportion  of  patients  treated  with  adalimumab  achieving  a  PedACR30 2 response was lower in AAA positive patients compared with AAA negative patients. In the OL LI, the overall proportion of patients treated with adalimumab achieving a PedACR30 response at week 16 was lower in AAA positive patients (12 of 19, 63%) compared with AAA negative patients (132 of 152, 87%). Also in the DB phase, the overall proportion of patients treated with adalimumab achieving a PedACR30 response at week 48 was lower in AAA positive patients (6 of 14, 43%) compared with AAA negative patients (35 of 54, 65%). In the OLE FD phase at week 16, the overall proportion of patients treated with adalimumab achieving a PedACR30 response in AAA positive patients (12 of 17, 71%) compared with AAA negative patients (79/89, 89%). Overall, presence of AAA did not affect safety.

The  high  number  of  anti-adalimumab  antibodies  in  children  without  MTX  is  of  concern  and  the incidence  appears  considerably  higher  than  observed  in  adults.  Furthermore,  the  data  show  that presence of AAA was associated with reduced effect.

2 PedACR30  (American  College  of  Rheumatology  Paediatric  30)  is  a  standardised  outcome  measure  to  assess  relative efficacy in clinical trials, i.e., a measure of disease activity in JIA. It is defined as a 30% improvement in a minimum of three variables in the core set with worsening of one variable by no more than 30%. The ACR Paediatric 20, ACR Paediatric 50, ACR Paediatric 70, and ACR Paediatric 90 measures are also used as outcome measures in paediatric trials, and are defined as 20%, 50%, 70%, 90% improvement respectively in a minimum of three variables in the core set with worsening of one variable by no more than 30%.

## Clinical efficacy

## Study DE038

Study DE038 was a multicentre, phase III, randomised withdrawal, double-blind, stratified, parallelgroup study in children and adolescents (4 to 17 years old) with polyarticular JIA. Stratification into two groups, MTX-treated or non-MTX-treated, was made prior to study enrollment. Subjects in the MTX stratum were treated concomitantly with MTX during the study and the current dose of MTX was to have been stable for at least 3 months prior to screening. Subjects who were in the non-MTX stratum were either naïve to MTX or had been withdrawn from MTX at least two weeks prior to study drug administration and were not treated concomitantly with MTX during the study.

The  study  had  four  phases.  During  the  first  three  of  these,  adalimumab  was  given  at  a  dose  of 24 mg/m 2 of BSA (up to a maximum total body dose of 40 mg) sc eow. The phases are listed below and table 1 presents the number of subjects in each phase of the study:

1. a 16-week open-label lead-in ( OL LI ) phase, (24 mg/m 2 BSA eow sc. N: 171)
2. a 32-week double blind ( DB ) phase, (24 mg/m 2 BSA eow sc - or - placebo. N: 133)
3. an open-label extension BSA dose ( OLE BSA ) phase. (24 mg/m 2 BSA eow sc. N: 128).
4. an open label extension fixed dose ( OLE FD ) phase in which subjects had their dose changed from a regimen based on BSA to a fixed dose regimen. (20 mg or 40 mg FD eow sc. N: 106).

The randomised withdrawal from study drug occurred at week 16 of the OL LI phase. Patients with a PedACR30 response were randomised within their stratum in a 1:1 ratio to placebo or adalimumab during the 32-week DB phase of the study. Subjects, who experienced disease flare during the DB phase,  and  those  who  completed,  were  eligible  to  immediately  enroll  into  the  open  label  extension BSA (OLE BSA) phase.

Subjects in the OLE BSA phase at the time of approval of the OLE FD protocol amendment were eligible to receive a fixed dose of either 20 mg or 40 mg eow adalimumab based on their body weight. Duration of participation in the OLE BSA phase varied for each subject.

The OLE FD phase was implemented to gather safety and efficacy data on a fixed dosing regimen based  on  body  weight.  In  this  phase,  subjects  with  a  body  weight  below  30  kg  received  20  mg adalimumab eow and subjects with a body weight equal or above 30 kg received 40 mg adalimumab eow. Subjects may continue the OLE FD phase for a maximum of five years or up to sixty days post marketing approval of the JIA indication in their respective country.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP considered the design of the pivotal study as acceptable, although complicated. For ethical reasons,  a  withdrawal  design  is  acceptable  and  has  also  been  previously  recognised  in  JIA  trials. Inclusion  of  both  MTX-  and  a  non-MTX  strata,  allows  for  a  comparison  of  monotherapy  and combination  therapy  with  MTX;  which  is  of  clinical  value.  The  CHMP  noted  that  the  efficacy evaluation was undertaken when subjects were treated with the BSA dose regimen, although the MAH applied for a fixed dose, based on body weight. The fixed dose was only studied during a 16 weeks open phase.

## Subject Population

The main inclusion criteria were subjects between 4 and 17 years with a diagnosis of polyarticular course  JIA  as  defined  by  the  ACR  criteria.  Subjects  were  to  have  had  continuing  active  disease defined  as ≥ 5  swollen  joints  and ≥ 3  joints  with  limitation  of  passive  motion  joint  count  (LOM). Disease onset may have been systemic, polyarticular, or pauciarticular.  If  the disease  was  systemic onset, subjects were to be free of any systemic JIA manifestations for at least three months before the time of qualification. Subjects were to have been either naïve to MTX, inadequate responders to MTX, or intolerant to MTX. Subjects who were refractory to MTX after 3 months of treatment were to have active disease after 3 months prior to enrollment. The duration of disease was to have been at least long enough for a subject to be given an adequate test of NSAIDs. Subjects were not to have received other DMARDs for at least four weeks prior to receiving the 1 st dose of study drug and were to have demonstrated  active  disease  prior  to  a  minimum  four  weeks  (28  days)  washout  of  all  DMARDs. Subjects were not to have received an intra-articular glucocorticoid injection within four weeks (28 days) prior to enrollment into the study. Overall, the CHMP considered the inclusion and exclusion criteria as acceptable.

## Efficacy Variables

The primary efficacy  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  adalimumab-treated  subjects  in  the  non-MTX stratum  who  experienced  disease  flare  in  the  DB  phase.  The  criteria  for  disease  flare  were  both  a ≥ 30% worsening in at least 3 out of 6 JIA core set criteria and also a minimum of two active joints and ≥ 30% improvement in not more than one of the six JIA core set criteria. The DB baseline was used as the reference point for the disease flare calculation.

The following JIA core set of variables were used to determine disease flare:

- Physician's Global Assessment of subject's disease severity by VAS (Visual analog scales)
- Parent's Global Assessment of subject's overall well-being by VAS
- Number of active joints (joints with swelling not due to deformity or joints with LOM and with pain, tenderness or both)
- Number of joints with LOM
- DICHAQ (disability Index of the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire)
- CRP (C-reactive protein) - Change in CRP from baseline was evaluated for clinical improvement or worsening only if at least one of the CRP values, baseline value, or the visit value was outside the normal reference range.

Among  secondary  efficacy  variables,  there  were  a  number  related  to  disease  flare,  as  well  as assessment of PedACR30/50/70/90 responses. The PedACR30 response in OL LI phase and DB phase was defined as ≥ 30% improvement in at least 3 of the JIA core set of criteria and ≥ 30% worsening in not more than one of the JIA core set. The PedACR50/70/90 in the DB phase were defined similarly to the PedACR30 using improvement percentages of 50, 70, and 90, respectively, while the worsening percentage criteria was kept unchanged at 30%.

## Baseline disease characteristics

In the OL LI and the OLE BSA phases, there were no statistically significant differences in baseline disease characteristics between treatment groups or within the respective strata. Different ages were reasonably  well  represented  in  the  two  groups.  For  all  parameters  describing  disease  activity,  there was  a  tendency  towards  more  active  disease  in  the  non-MTX  treated  group.  This  was  not  found surprising  as  a  non-treated  population  is  more  likely  to  have  more  active  disease  than  a  population with active disease despite MTX.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical Methods

The statistical methods used were considered appropriate.

## Dose selection

The controlled part of study was undertaken with a dose of 24 mg/m 2 BSA. The MAH justified the proposed fixed dose regimens since individualised dosing based on BSA could be disadvantageous because: 1) patients/parents may attempt to re-use a dosage unit intended for single use and thereby increase the potential for infection; 2) additional efforts are needed to calculate the individualised dose and administer the correct volume from the single use dosage unit.

## Results

## Main efficacy endpoints

## Open label lead in phase (OLE LI)

The response rate, defined as PedACR30, during this phase was high in both groups, 80/85 (94%) with MTX and 64/86 (74%) without MTX. There were more responders among the patients with \"active disease  despite  MTX\"  compared  with  patients  without  MTX,  which  indicate  an  increased  efficacy with combination therapy. Six patients in the non-MTX stratum discontinued treatment due to lack of efficacy, but none in the MTX group. Of those who completed the OLE LI, 8 (9%) from the MTX group and 19 (22%) from the non-MTX group did not continue into the DB phase. This indicates that monotherapy was insufficient to achieve adequate response in certain individuals.

There were 27 subjects, who were PedACR responders at the end of the OL LI phase but who were not enrolled into the DB phase. The submitted LOCF analysis was questioned when considering the long-term treatment, the chronic disease intended and the paediatric contest.

Due to the low threshold for flare and the use of imputation (drop out for any reason, missing values and LOCF), the results of the primary efficacy analysis were questioned. It was considered that in the DB phase, a proportion of patients who were in the placebo arm may improve, also after a flare. The imputation assumes there will be no further improvement and could weaken the control arm. Because more patients  drop  out  of  the  placebo  condition  than  the  adalimumab  arm,  imputation  (particularly LOCF) results  in  a  bias  in  favour  of  the  alternative  hypothesis.  After  further  to  discussions  it  was concluded that short term efficacy was demonstrated for adalimumab, but due to the trial design, the superiority  of  adalimumab  over  placebo  in  the  treatment  of  JIA  may  be  overestimated.  It  was considered of importance to collect efficacy data in the 'real-world' practice. The MAH agreed to set up a registry in JIA patients (see Attachment 10, letter of undertaking). The secondary objective of this registry will be to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of Humira in JIA patients who are treated as recommended in the approved product information. Patients treated with MTX will be considered a reference group. Additionally, section 4.2 of the SPC contains the statement ' Available data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment.  Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. ' which should reduce the risk that patients not responding receive continued treatment.

## Double blind phase - primary efficacy analysis

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with disease flare in the non-MTX population in the DB  phase. A  statistically significantly lower proportion of adalimumab-treated subjects demonstrated disease flare  compared to  placebo-treated  subjects  in  the  non-MTX  stratum  (43%  for adalimumab vs. 71% for placebo; p = 0.031) as well as in the MTX stratum (37% for adalimumab vs 65% for placebo; p= 0.015). The CHMP noted that in both strata, the numbers of patients with flares in  these  enriched  populations  given  continuous  active  treatment  during  the  treatment  period  of 32 weeks, was rather high, 43% in the adalimumab group and 37% in the MTX + adalimumab group. Long-term efficacy may thus be questioned. The rather high number of flares may also suggest that there  was  a  considerable  placebo  response  with  the  defined  response  criteria  during  the  LI  phase. Logistic regression analyses showed no influence of prior use of NSAIDs or corticosteroids on disease flare.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Among  the  secondary  endpoints,  time  to  disease  flare  was  statistically  different  in  favour  of  the adalimumab treated groups in both strata. It was more than 32 weeks in both adalimumab groups, and 14 - 20 weeks for subjects who received placebo (both strata). Further, it was noted that there were at least 21/65 patients in the placebo-treated groups without disease flare during the 32-week treatment period, in addition to the patients on placebo who flared after a treatment free period of several weeks. In the group of patients who had a treatment free period, the safety profile following reintroduction of adalimumab was presented in detail. Among patients with no flare during the DB phase, a tendency towards more injection site reactions was found, but also a lower number of infections. These data are however, very limited due to a low number of patients. More knowledge on the risks and/or loss of efficacy in patients who interrupt treatment and restart again was considered important and should be collected in e.g. the registry. Clarifications that data from week 36 to week 48 in the adalimumab arm were not based on LOCF were provided.

In  the  analysis  of  PedACR30  responders  at  week  48,  the  result  for  the  non-MTX  group  was  not statistically  significant.  The  endpoint  PedACR30  responders  in  the  MTX  strata  reached  statistical significance in favour of adalimumab, the observed difference between placebo and active in the two strata  was  the  same;  25%. PedACR30 values tended to decrease over time, relatively parallel in all four  groups,  with  a  slightly  higher  decline  in  the  placebo  groups.  For  the  measures  PedACR50/70 (indicating a higher degree of improvement), the CHMP noted that there appeared to be a tendency towards a better effect with the MTX+adalimumab combination.

## Long-term efficacy

All subjects who completed 32 weeks of DB phase or experienced a flare were eligible to receive OL adalimumab during the OLE BSA phase. Due to the study design, subjects had different durations of exposure during the OLE BSA phase. There were only five subjects with exposure of 136 weeks. The CHMP noted this limited amount of data following longer term treatment, and that the numbers of treated patients decreased over time in the open BSA phase, partly due to recruitment of patients into the FD regimen.

Initially only 16 weeks data from the FD phase was included. It was concluded that, since individuals were treated in an open setting with the fixed dose, evaluation of efficacy of the fixed dose was not possible. Further to answers to outstanding issues data for the fixed dose period up to week 64 was submitted. However, given the few subjects included, and the open design, these data were considered of limited value.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

One  pivotal  trial  was  performed  to  study  efficacy  and  safety  in  children  aged  4-17  years,  with polyarticular  JIA.  The  table  2  below  shows  an  overview  of  the  study.  An  open  initial  phase  study design, including two strata (non-MTX and MTX), followed by a double-blind withdrawal phase was chosen  mainly  from  the  ethical  point  of  view.  However,  this  design  may  not  be  optimal  to  prove efficacy. The study population was adequate as well as the chosen clinical endpoints.

In the open initial phase of the study, the response rate, according to the predefined 30% improvement criteria, was 94% with MTX + adalimumab and 74% in the group given adalimumab without MTX. There  were  more  responders  among  the  patients  with  \"active  disease  despite  MTX\"  (i.e.  the  group given combination therapy) compared with patients without MTX, and more patients without MTX discontinued the open phase, which indicates an increased efficacy with combination therapy.

The primary endpoint, proportion of subjects with disease flare in the non-MTX stratum during the DB phase, was statistically significantly in favour of adalimumab. The same result was shown in the MTX stratum. However, due to the low threshold for flare and the use of imputation the results of the primary efficacy analysis were questionable. It was accepted that adalimumab prevents disease flares compared to placebo but due to the trial design, the superiority of adalimumab over placebo in the treatment of JIA may be overestimated. The current measures should reduce the risk of patients not responding: the product information advises caution if a patient does not respond within 12 weeks of treatment; furthermore, a registry aiming to collect more data in this regard will be set up.

The MAH applied for two fixed doses, with a weight cut off of 30 kg, despite that the controlled phase of the study was undertaken with BSA dosing. It was concluded that the available data with the fixed doses was insufficient, both in terms of efficacy and safety (see section 3.24 on clinical safety), due to the open label treatment in a limited number of subjects. Following assessment of the responses to the first set of questions raised, it remains evident that only BSA dosing has been adequately documented. The MAH provided a justification for use of a fixed dose of 40 mg from the age of 13 years, which was  endorsed.  For  younger  children,  the  CHMP  did  not  agree  that  there  is  sufficient  evidence  to support a fixed dose regimen. Consequently, there was a need for a syringe that can reassure accurate dosing for younger children. The MAH did not find it possible to currently provide such syringe, and therefore  withdrew  a  claim  (section  4.1  and  4.2)  for  children  below  13  years  of  age.  The  CHMP considered  it  disappointing  that  younger  children  would  not  be  addressed  in  the  indication  and posology, due to such reason, but the approach was accepted. The CHMP agreed on describing the clinical study in section 5.1 of the SPC, including the age of the patients studied and dose regimens used.

There  were  tendencies  of  better  efficacy  in  the  combination  group  compared  with  the  group  given adalimumab monotherapy. In the initial OL LI phase a higher percentage of responders were found in the MTX-group, 94 %, versus 74% in non-MTX group. In addition, the number of discontinuations was higher in the non-MTX during the initial phase, and there was a higher number of responders achieving  the  more  stricter  Ped  ARC50/70  criteria  in  the  combination  group.  Anti-adalimumab antibodies developed in a higher number in the non-MTX group, 26% versus 6%, which also raised concerns regarding long term efficacy. Further, the pharmacokinetic data indicate a higher adalimumab plasma level in the combination group. Overall, these data support combination therapy with MTX, and therefore combination therapy is the primary recommendation for this indication.

## Clinical safety

The  safety  of  adalimumab  was  determined  through  evaluation  of  AEs  (adverse  events),  clinical laboratory  evaluations,  physical  examinations,  and  vital  signs.  In  addition,  TNF -inhibitor  related AEs of interest were evaluated: infections, serious infections, malignancies, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis  (TB),  demyelinating  disorders,  lupus -like  syndrome,  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF), allergic reactions, injection site reactions, haematologic events, and hepatic events.

## Patient exposure

In the OL LI phase and the DB phase, there were 55 subjects exposed to adalimumab, corresponding the  44  patients  years  (PYs).  During  the  subsequent  open  label  phases,  exposure  corresponded  to 118 PYs. The table 3 below shows an overview of the safety analysis set for the FD phase.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

There were no deaths, malignancies, congestive heart failure (CHF), central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating  diseases,  opportunistic  infections,  serious  blood  dyscrasias,  or  lupus-like  reactions reported in the study DE038.

Overall, 35 subjects reported 55 SAEs of which most were mild to moderate in severity. There were 9 SAEs that  were  reported  as  severe  of  which  3  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  at  least possibly related to study drug. Pneumonia was reported during the OL LI phase and bronchopneumonia was reported during the OLE BSA phase; both events were reported for subjects in the non- MTX stratum. The third event, herpes zoster was reported for a subject in the MTX stratum during the OLE BSA phase. These events were resolved and the subjects continued in the study. Eight events were related to infections and three cases of appendicitis were reported.

## Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug

Twelve subjects reported AEs that lead to the discontinuation of study drug. Nine AEs were reported in  the  OL  LI  phase.  Disease  flare  occurred  in  7/12  (whereof  5  in  non-MTX,  OL  LI),  one  had leucopenia, two infections (pneumoniae) and one dizziness. One individual in the MTX stratum was discontinued  from  the  study  due  to  elevated  transaminases  approximately  2  months  after  first  drug administration.

## Laboratory findings

No new safety signals  were  found  from  changes  in  laboratory  parameters  during  the  phases  of  the study.

## Discussion on clinical safety

The  CHMP  concluded  that  there  were  no  new  safety  signals  in  the  treated  children/adolescents compared  with  the  already  well  known  safety  profile  in  adults.  Infections  were  the  most  common events, as for adults. No  cases of death, malignancies, CHF,  CNS  demyelinating  diseases, opportunistic infections, serious blood dyscrasias, or lupus-like reactions were reported. However, it was noted that the database is very small, and long-term safety cannot be assessed. In this regard, the main concerns are the development of malignancies. Regarding the fixed dose regimens applied for there is very limited safety data to assess possible implications of the dose changes, particularly in the younger children. In the FD phase of the study, a substantial number of patients, mainly in the lower age groups (and early Tanner stages) received an increased dose of ≥ 10 mg with the FD regimen. This is of concern, since no data are available to properly assess whether an increased dose is of any benefit to  the  young  child,  or  to  assess  neither  short-term  nor  long-term  safety,  in  the  younger  children. Further,  it  appears  that  the  number  of  subjects  with  any  AE  was  higher  (67.9%)  in  the  group  who received  an  increased  adalimumab  dose  vs.  those  who  stayed  on  the  same  or  decreased  the  dose (47.2%). The difference was particularly evident for infectious AEs irrespective to the MTX stratum.

The MAH provided some further comparisons on the safety profile in patients with or without disease flare  during  the  double-blind  phase.  There  was  a  tendency  towards  more  injection  site  reactions  in subjects  without  flare,  but  also  a  lower  number  of  infections.  These  data  are  very  limited.  More knowledge on risks and/or loss of efficacy from patients who interrupt treatment and restart again is of importance, and should be followed in the registry.

## Risk management plan

The MAH submitted a risk management plan (RMP), which covered all approved indications as well as the indication which was under evaluation (JIA).

The risk minimisation activities for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product as defined in the annex II are applicable to this new indication. The new version (4.0) of the risk management plan was reflected in the annex II.

A  summary  of  the  RMP  for  adalimumab  highlighting  the  safety  concerns  with  adalimumab  is presented below:

| Children < 4 years of age for JIA indications | Incidence of JIA in children below 4 years is low. However, data for children from age 2 onwards will be collected in a compassionate use study (Study M10-444) followed by data from the JIA registry (P10-262).                                            | Section 4.2 of the SPC addresses the lack of information in paediatric patients. As data in this paediatric populations (less than 4 years) are collected and submitted this information will be included in the SPC once available. A planned clinical trial for these paediatric patients will provide safety and efficacy information for this group. Routine pharmacovigilance combined with the results of clinical trials will characterize the overall safety of paediatric patients and adalimumab use. Safety findings will be communicated in future PSURs and updates will be made to the CCDS and SPC as necessary. |

## Benefit risk assessment

One  pivotal  study  was  performed  with  adalimumab  in  children/adolescents  aged  4-17  years  with polyarticular  JIA.  Subjects  were  stratified  according  to  MTX  use  or  no  MTX  (either  naïve  or intolerant).  Initially,  there  was  an  open  label  lead-in  phase  where  all  patients  received  adalimumab, 24 mg/m 2 BSA.  Week  16,  responders  were  randomised  into  a  double-blind  withdrawal  phase  of 32 weeks,  where  the  primary  endpoint  (the  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  non-MTX  stratum  with  a disease flare) was assessed. In this phase, 58 subjects were enrolled into the non-MTX stratum and 75 into the MTX-stratum. The design was chosen from ethical reasons, but disadvantages in proving efficacy were noted. The study population and clinical endpoints were adequate.

After the blinded phase, patients could continue on open label BSA dosing. Thereafter, patients were switched to open label fixed dosing of 20 mg (subjects up to 30 kg body weight) or 40 mg (&gt; 30 kg) eow. The MAH initially proposed fixed dosing across the indication but this was not agreed with by the CHMP. The data presented allowed fixed dose of 40 mg from the age of 13 years. For younger

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

children,  dosing  based  on  BSA  was  recommended.  However,  the  MAH  has  not  yet  developed  a presentation which allows for the accurate dosing according to BSA, and therefore the indication was restricted to adolescents 13-17 years of age.

## Pharmacokinetics

Overall,  following  the  BSA-based  dosing  in  juvenile  subjects  (24  mg/m 2 with  a  maximum  dose  of 40 mg eow) steady-state serum concentrations obtained in subjects with JIA appeared to be within the range of those previously observed in adult subjects (40 mg eow in RA, AS and PsA patients), both during monotherapy and concomitant methotrexate treatment. There was a tendency for a higher interindividual variability in juvenile subjects compared with adults. In addition, during monotherapy the immunogenicity  rate  was  higher  in  juvenile  subjects  than  in  adults,  which  may  explain  the  larger variability. During concomitant methotrexate treatment the serum levels were on average higher and the  variability  was  lower.  Furthermore,  the  number  of  subjects  developing  AAA  was  lower  when MTX was given concomitantly compared with monotherapy (5.9 vs. 25.6%).

On  the  basis  of  data  from  study  DE038  PK  modelling  was  undertaken  to  support  the  fixed  dose regimens applied for. However, due to deficiencies in the model building and also in assessing how well the model simulates data, the pharmacokinetic documentation did not at present contribute in the assessment of safety and efficacy of the fixed dosing strategy. The conclusions made on the basis of the  simulations  can  only  be  qualitative  and  those  made  could  have  been  foreseen  by  predicting  the dose change in various weight groups on the basis of correlation between BSA and weight as follows: a)  increased  exposure  for  children  weighing  15-20  kg,  30-40  kg  and  40-50  kg  with  the  largest difference for children weighing 30-40 kg, b) decreased exposure for children weighing 20-30 kg. The quantitative assessment was not considered appropriate as the population model did not fit to the data and the predictive properties of the model were not assessed properly.

## Benefit

In the open initial phase, the response rate, according to the predefined 30% improvement criteria, was 94% with  MTX + adalimumab and 74% in the  adalimimab  monotherapy  group.  There  were  more responders among the patients with \"active disease despite MTX\" (i.e. the group given combination therapy) compared with patients without MTX, and more patients without MTX discontinued the open phase,  which  indicate  an  increased  efficacy  with  combination  therapy.  Therefore  it  was  considered that combination  therapy is the primary recommendation,  but  in case of  MTX  intolerance, monotherapy might be an option.

During the blinded withdrawal phase, the primary endpoint, proportion of subjects with disease flare in  the  non-MTX  stratum,  as  well  as  the  same  endpoint  in  the  MTX  stratum,  was  statistically significantly in favour of adalimumab, but due to the low threshold for flare and the use of imputation the  results  of  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  were  questionable.  It  was  accepted  that  adalimumab prevents disease flares compared to placebo in the non-MTX stratum. However, due to the trial design, the  superiority  of  adalimumab  over  placebo  in  the  treatment  of  JIA  may  be  overestimated.  It  was considered  of  importance  to  collect  efficacy  data  in  the  registry  setting,  which  the  MAH  agreed  to undertake (see Attachment 10, letter of undertaking).

The  MAH  applied  for  two  fixed  doses,  with  a  weight  cut  off  of  30  kg,  despite  the  fact  that  the controlled phase of the study was undertaken with BSA dosing. It was concluded that the available data with the fixed doses was insufficient, both in terms of efficacy and safety, due to the open label treatment in a limited number of subjects. A justification for use of a fixed dose of 40 mg from the age of 13 years was agreed with. However, due to lack of a syringe that can reassure accurate dosing for younger children, where BSA dosing needs to be applied, the use in children less than 13 years cannot be recommended for approval. The indication was revised accordingly.

There  are  tendencies  of  better  efficacy  in  the  combination  group  compared  with  the  group  given adalimumab monotherapy. In the initial open lead-in phase a higher percentage of responders were found  in  the  MTX-group,  94  %,  versus  74%  in  non-MTX  group.  In  addition,  the  number  of discontinuations was higher in the non-MTX during the initial phase, and there was a higher number of  responders  achieving  the  more  stricter  Ped  ARC50/70  criteria  in  the  combination  group.  Anti-

adalimumab antibodies developed in a higher number in the non-MTX group, 26% versus 6%, which also raises concerns regarding long term efficacy. Finally, the pharmacokinetic data indicate a higher adalimumab plasma level in the combination group. Overall, these data support combination therapy with MTX. This is resolved by adequate descriptions in the SPC, including that combination therapy is the primary recommendation in the indication.

## Risk

No alarming safety signals were found in the performed study. No cases of death, malignancies, CHF, CNS demyelinating diseases, opportunistic infections, serious blood dyscrasias, or lupus-like reactions were reported. However, the data base is very small, and long-term safety cannot be assessed; main concerns being development of malignancies. In terms of the fixed dose regimens applied for, there is very limited safety data to assess possible implications of the dose changes, particularly in the younger children.  The  additional  data  from  open  label  fixed  dose  use  up  to  64  weeks  are  still  insufficient, particularly  for  the  smallest  and  youngest  population.  Thus,  in  terms  of  safety,  there  is  insufficient support for the fixed dose regimens applied for.

Overall,  the  RMP  is  acceptable.  The  MAH  agreed  to  develop  a  registry  where  both  safety  and effectiveness data will be collected, which is endorsed. The MAH will follow subjects for 5 years for all  events  specified  in  the  Registry  protocol  and an  additional  5-years  on  an  annual  basis  to  collect events of Congestive Heart Failure and Malignancies.

## Benefit / Risk Balance

Efficacy has been sufficiently demonstrated with the body surface area dosing of 24 mg/m 2 . There are tendencies of better efficacy with a combination of adalimumab and MTX. The indication was revised and combination therapy with MTX is the primary option. A fixed dose of 40 mg from the age of 13 years  was  agreed.  Due  to  lack  of  an  appropriate  dosing  device,  no  claim  for  children  less  than 13 years of age is made.

The  safety  profile  demonstrated  in  the  study  shows  no  unexpected  findings,  but  long-term  safety remains a concerns. To conclude, the benefit / risk balance for the treatment of subjects aged 13-17 years, with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who have inadequate response to one or more DMARDs, was considered positive.

The changes to the product information were agreed with, including the update of the annexes in line with the latest QRD template.

The conditions as detailed before remained unchanged. However, the annex II was updated to clearly mention  the  new  indication  (JIA)  and  to  include  the  new  version  of  the  RMP  approved  with  this indication.

## CONCLUSION

On 24  July  2008  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the amendments to be introduced in the summary of product characteristics and package leaflet.
