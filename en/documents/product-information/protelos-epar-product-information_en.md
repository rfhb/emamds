<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

PROTELOS 2 g granules for oral suspension

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Due to the nature of the treated disease, strontium ranelate is intended for long-term use.

3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Granules for oral suspension Yellow granules 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Treatment of severe osteoporosis: -in postmenopausal women, -in adult men, at high risk of fracture, for whom treatment with other medicinal products approved for the treatment of osteoporosis is not possible due to, for example, contraindications or intolerance. In postmenopausal women, strontium ranelate reduces the risk of vertebral and hip fractures (see section 5.1). The decision to prescribe strontium ranelate  should be based on an assessment of the individual patient's overall risks (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment should  only be initiated by a physician with experience in the treatment of osteoporosis. Posology The recommended dose is one 2 g sachet once daily by oral administration. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The absorption of strontium ranelate is reduced by food, milk and derivative products and therefore, PROTELOS should be administered in-between meals. Given the slow absorption, PROTELOS should be taken at bedtime, preferably at least two hours after eating (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).

Patients treated with strontium ranelate should receive vitamin D and calcium supplements if dietary intake is inadequate.

## Elderly

The efficacy and safety of strontium ranelate have been established in a broad age range (up to 100 years at inclusion) of adult men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. No dose adjustment is required in relation to age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

Strontium ranelate is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (30-70 ml/min creatinine clearance) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of PROTELOS in children aged below 18 years have not been established. No data are available.

Treatment should be stopped if the patient develops ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease or if hypertension is uncontrolled (see section 4.3).

Method of administration For oral use. The granules in the sachets must be taken as a suspension in a glass containing a minimum of 30 ml (approximately one third of a standard glass) of water. Although in-use studies have demonstrated that strontium ranelate is stable in suspension for 24 hours after preparation, the suspension should be drunk immediately after being prepared. 4.3 Contraindications - Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. - Current or previous venous thromboembolic events (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. - Temporary or permanent immobilisation due to e.g. post-surgical recovery or prolonged bed rest. - Established, current or past history of ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease and/or cerebrovascular disease. - Uncontrolled hypertension. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Cardiac ischaemic events In pooled randomised placebo-controlled studies of post-menopausal osteoporotic patients, a significant increase in myocardial infarction has been observed in PROTELOS treated patients compared to placebo (see section 4.8). Before starting treatment, patients should be evaluated with respect to cardiovascular risk. Patients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking) should only be treated with strontium ranelate after careful consideration (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). During PROTELOS treatment, these cardiovascular risks should be monitored on a regular basis generally every 6 to 12 months. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Venous thromboembolism

In phase III placebo-controlled studies, strontium ranelate treatment was associated with an increase in the annual incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including pulmonary embolism (see section 4.8). The cause of this finding is unknown. PROTELOS is contra-indicated in patients with a past history of venous thromboembolic events (see section 4.3) and should be used with caution in patients at risk of VTE.

When treating patients over 80 years at risk of VTE, the need for continued treatment with PROTELOS should be re-evaluated. PROTELOS should be discontinued as soon as possible in the event of an illness or a condition leading to immobilisation (see section 4.3) and adequate preventive

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

measures taken. Therapy should not be restarted until the initiating condition has resolved and the patient is fully mobile. When a VTE occurs, PROTELOS should be stopped .

## Use in patients with renal impairment

In the absence of bone safety data in patients with severe renal impairment treated with strontium ranelate, PROTELOS is not recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min (see section 5.2). In accordance with good medical practice, periodic assessment of renal function is recommended in patients with chronic renal impairment. Continuation of treatment with PROTELOS in patients developing severe renal impairment should be considered on an individual basis.

## Skin reactions

Life-threatening cutaneous reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)) have been reported with the use of PROTELOS.

Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin reactions. The highest risk for occurrence of SJS or TEN is within the first weeks of treatment and usually around 3-6 weeks for DRESS. If symptoms or signs of SJS or TEN (e.g. progressive skin rash often with blisters or mucosal lesions) or DRESS (e.g. rash, fever, eosinophilia and systemic involvement (e.g. adenopathy, hepatitis, interstitial nephropathy, interstitial lung disease) are present, PROTELOS treatment should be discontinued immediately. The best results in managing SJS, TEN or DRESS come from early diagnosis and immediate discontinuation of any suspect drug. Early withdrawal is associated with a better prognosis. The outcome of DRESS is favorable in most cases upon discontinuation of PROTELOS and after initiation of corticosteroid therapy when necessary. Recovery could be slow and recurrences of the syndrome have been reported in some cases after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. If the patient has developed SJS, TEN or DRESS with the use of PROTELOS, PROTELOS must not be re-started in this patient at any time. A higher incidence, although still rare, of hypersensitivity reactions including skin rash, SJS or TEN in patients of Asian origin has been reported (see section 4.8). HLA-A*33:03 and HLA-B*58:01 alleles have been identified as potential genetic risk factors for strontium ranelate-associated SJS/TEN in Han Chinese patients from a retrospective, case-control, pharmacogenetic study. Where possible, screening for HLA-A*33:03 and HLA-B*58:01 alleles could be considered before starting treatment with PROTELOS in patients of Han Chinese origin. If tests are positive for one or both alleles, PROTELOS should not be started. However, absence of these alleles upon genotyping does not exclude that SJS/TEN can still occur. Interaction with laboratory test Strontium interferes with colorimetric methods for the determination of blood and urinary calcium concentrations. Therefore, in medical practice, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry or atomic absorption spectrometry methods should be used to ensure an accurate assessment of blood and urinary calcium concentrations.

## Excipient

PROTELOS contains aspartame, a source of phenylalanine, which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Food, milk and derivative products, and medicinal products containing calcium may reduce the bioavailability of strontium ranelate by approximately 60-70%. Therefore, administration of PROTELOS and such products should be separated by at least two hours (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

As divalent cations can form complexes with oral tetracycline (e.g. doxycycline) and quinolone antibiotics (e.g. ciprofloxacin) at the gastro-intestinal level and thereby reduce their absorption,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

simultaneous administration of strontium ranelate with these medicinal products is not recommended. As a precautionary measure, PROTELOS treatment should be suspended during treatment with oral tetracycline or quinolone antibiotics.

An in vivo clinical interaction study showed that the administration of aluminium and magnesium hydroxides either two hours before or together with strontium ranelate caused a slight decrease in the absorption of strontium ranelate (20-25% AUC decrease), while absorption was almost unaffected when the antacid was given two hours after strontium ranelate. It is therefore preferable to take antacids at least two hours after PROTELOS. However, when this dosing regimen is impractical due to the recommended administration of PROTELOS at bedtime, concomitant intake remains acceptable.

No interaction was observed with oral supplementation of vitamin D.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

No evidence of clinical interactions or relevant increase of blood strontium levels with medicinal products expected to be commonly prescribed concomitantly with PROTELOS in the target population were found during clinical trials. These included: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (including acetylsalicylic acid), anilides (such as paracetamol), H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors, diuretics, digoxin and cardiac glycosides, organic nitrates and other vasodilators for cardiac diseases, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, selective beta-2 adrenoceptor agonists, oral anticoagulants, platelet aggregation inhibitors, statins, fibrates and benzodiazepine derivatives. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy There are no data from the use of strontium ranelate in pregnant women. At high doses, animal studies have shown reversible bone effects in the offspring of rats and rabbits treated during pregnancy (see section 5.3). If PROTELOS is used inadvertently during pregnancy, treatment must be stopped. Breast-feeding Physico-chemical data suggest excretion of Strontium ranelate in human milk. PROTELOS should not be used during breast-feeding. Fertility No effects were observed on males and females fertility in animal studies. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Strontium ranelate has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Summary of the safety profile

PROTELOS has been studied in clinical trials involving nearly 8,000 participants. Long-term safety has been evaluated in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis treated for up to 60 months with strontium ranelate 2 g/day (n=3,352) or placebo (n=3,317) in phase III studies. Mean age was 75 years at inclusion and 23% of the patients enrolled were 80 to 100 years of age.

In a pooled analysis of randomised placebo-controlled studies in post-menopausal osteoporotic patients , the most common adverse reactions consisted of nausea and diarrhoea, which were generally reported at the beginning of treatment with no noticeable difference between groups afterwards. Discontinuation of therapy was mainly due to nausea.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were no differences in the nature of adverse reactions between treatment groups regardless of whether patients were aged below or above 80 at inclusion.

In most cases, these values spontaneously reverted to normal without change in treatment. Description of selected adverse reactions Venous thromboembolism In phase III studies, the annual incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) observed over 5 years was approximately 0.7%, with a relative risk of 1.4 (95% CI = [1.0 ; 2.0]) in strontium ranelate treated patients as compared to placebo (see section 4.4). Myocardial infarction In pooled randomised placebo-controlled studies of post-menopausal osteoporotic patients, a significant increase of myocardial infarction has been observed in strontium ranelate treated patients as compared to placebo (1.7% versus 1.1 %), with a relative risk of 1.6 (95% CI = [1.07 ; 2.38]). Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose Symptoms Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Management

Following episodes of overdoses during clinical trials (up to 4 g/day for a maximal duration of 147 days), no clinically relevant events were observed.

Administration of milk or antacids may be helpful to reduce the absorption of the active substance. In the event of substantial overdose, vomiting may be considered to remove unabsorbed active substance.

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for the treatment of bone diseases - Other drugs affecting bone structure and mineralisation, ATC code: M05BX03.

## Mechanism of action

In vitro , strontium ranelate:

- -increases bone formation in bone tissue culture as well as osteoblast precursor replication and collagen synthesis in bone cell culture.
- -reduces bone resorption by decreasing osteoclast differentiation and resorbing activity.

This results in a rebalance of bone turnover in favour of bone formation.

The activity of strontium ranelate was studied in various non-clinical models. In particular, in intact rats, strontium ranelate increases trabecular bone mass, trabeculae number and thickness; this results in an improvement of bone strength. In bone tissue of treated animals and humans, strontium is mainly adsorbed onto the crystal surface and only slightly substitutes for calcium in the apatite crystal of newly formed bone. Strontium ranelate does not modify the bone crystal characteristics. In iliac crest bone biopsies obtained after up to 60 months of treatment with strontium ranelate 2 g/day in phase III trials, no deleterious effects on bone quality or mineralisation were observed. The combined effects of strontium distribution in bone (see section 5.2) and increased X-ray absorption of strontium as compared to calcium, leads to an amplification of bone mineral density (BMD) measurement by dual-photon X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Available data indicate that these factors account for approximately 50% of the measured change in BMD over 3 years of treatment with PROTELOS 2 g/day. This should be taken into account when interpreting BMD changes during treatment with PROTELOS. In phase III studies, which demonstrated the anti-fracture efficacy of PROTELOS treatment, measured mean BMD increased from baseline with PROTELOS by approximately 4% per year at the lumbar spine and 2% per year at the femoral neck, reaching 13% to 15% and 5% to 6% respectively after 3 years, depending on the study. In phase III studies, as compared to placebo, biochemical markers of bone formation (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen) increased and those of bone resorption (serum C-telopeptide and urinary N-telopeptide cross links) decreased from the third month of treatment up to 3 years. Secondary to the pharmacological effects of strontium ranelate, slight decreases in calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) serum concentrations, increases in blood phosphorus concentrations and in total alkaline phosphatase activity were observed, with no observed clinical consequences.

## Clinical efficacy

Osteoporosis is defined as BMD of the spine or hip 2.5 SD or more below the mean value of a normal young population. A number of risk factors are associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis including low bone mass, low bone mineral density, early menopause, a history of smoking and a family history of osteoporosis. The clinical consequence of osteoporosis is fractures. The risk of fractures is increased with the number of risk factors.

## Treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis:

The anti-fracture studies program of PROTELOS was made up of two placebo-controlled phase III studies: SOTI study and TROPOS study. SOTI involved 1,649 postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis (low lumbar BMD and prevalent vertebral fracture) and a mean age of 70 years. TROPOS involved 5,091 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (low femoral neck BMD and prevalent fracture in more than half of them) and a mean age of 77 years. Together, SOTI

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and TROPOS enrolled 1,556 patients over 80 years at inclusion (23.1% of the study population). In addition to their treatment (2 g/day strontium ranelate or placebo), the patients received adapted calcium and vitamin D supplements throughout both studies.

PROTELOS reduced the relative risk of new vertebral fracture by 41% over 3 years in the SOTI study (table 1). The effect was significant from the first year. Similar benefits were demonstrated in women with multiple fractures at baseline. With respect to clinical vertebral fractures (defined as fractures associated with back pain and/or a body height loss of at least 1 cm), the relative risk was reduced by 38%. PROTELOS also decreased the number of patients with a body height loss of at least 1 cm as compared to placebo. Quality of life assessment on the QUALIOST specific scale as well as the General Health perception score of the SF-36 general scale indicated benefit of PROTELOS, compared with placebo.

Efficacy of PROTELOS to reduce the risk of new vertebral fracture was confirmed in the TROPOS study, including for osteoporotic patients without fragility fracture at baseline.

An a-posteriori analysis was performed on a subgroup of patients from the TROPOS study of particular medical interest and at high-risk of fracture [defined by a femoral neck BMD T-score ≤ 3 SD (manufacturer's range corresponding to -2.4 SD using NHANES III) and an age ≥ 74 years (n=1,977, i.e. 40% of the TROPOS study population)]. In this group, over 3 years of treatment, PROTELOS reduced the risk of hip fracture by 36% relative to the placebo group (table 2).

Table 1: Incidence of patients with vertebral fracture and relative risk reduction In patients over 80 years of age at inclusion, a pooled analysis of SOTI and TROPOS studies showed that PROTELOS reduced the relative risk of experiencing new vertebral fractures by 32% over 3 years (incidence of 19.1% with strontium ranelate vs. 26.5% with placebo). In an a-posteriori analysis of patients from the pooled SOTI and TROPOS studies with baseline lumbar spine and / or femoral neck BMD in the osteopenic range and without prevalent fracture but with at least one additional risk factor for fracture (N=176), PROTELOS reduced the risk of a first vertebral fracture by 72% over 3 years (incidence of vertebral fracture 3.6% with strontium ranelate vs. 12.0% with placebo).

## Treatment of Osteoporosis in men:

The efficacy of PROTELOS was demonstrated in men with osteoporosis in a 2-year, doubleblind,placebo-controlled study with a main analysis after one year in 243 patients (Intention to years; mean lumbar BMD T-score value of -2.6; 28% of prevalent vertebral fracture).

treatpopulation, 161 patients received strontium ranelate) at high risk of fracture (mean age 72,7 All patients received daily supplemental calcium (1000 mg) and vitamin D (800 UI).

Statistically significant increases in BMD were observed as early as 6 months following initiation of PROTELOS treatment versus placebo.

Over 12 months, a statistically significant increase in mean lumbar spine BMD, main efficacy criteria (E (SE) = 5.32% (0.75); 95%CI = [3.86 ; 6.79]; p&lt;0,001), similar to that observed in the pivotal antifracture phase III studies carried-out inpostmenopausal women, was observed.

Statistically significant increases in femoral neck BMD and total hip BMD (p&lt;0,001) were observed after 12 months.

## Distribution

Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with PROTELOS in all subsets of the paediatric population in osteoporosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Strontium ranelate is made up of 2 atoms of stable strontium and 1 molecule of ranelic acid, the organic part permitting the best compromise in terms of molecular weight, pharmacokinetics and acceptability of the medicinal product. The pharmacokinetics of strontium and ranelic acid have been assessed in healthy young men and healthy postmenopausal women, as well as during long-term exposure in men with osteoporosis and postmenopausal osteoporotic women including elderly women. Due to its high polarity, the absorption, distribution and binding to plasma proteins of ranelic acid are low. There is no accumulation of ranelic acid and no evidence of metabolism in animals and humans. Absorbed ranelic acid is rapidly eliminated unchanged via the kidneys. Absorption The absolute bioavailability of strontium is about 25% (range 19-27%) after an oral dose of 2 g strontium ranelate. Maximum plasma concentrations are reached 3-5 hours after a single dose of 2 g. Steady state is reached after 2 weeks of treatment. Intake of strontium ranelate with calcium or food reduces the bioavailability of strontium by approximately 60-70%, compared with administration 3 hours after a meal. Due to the relatively slow absorption of strontium, food and calcium intake should be avoided both before and after administration of PROTELOS. Oral supplementation with vitamin D has no effect on strontium exposure. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Strontium has a volume of distribution of about 1 l/kg. The binding of strontium to human plasma proteins is low (25%) and strontium has a high affinity for bone tissue. Measurement of strontium concentration in iliac crest bone biopsies from patients treated for up to 60 months with strontium ranelate 2 g/day indicate that bone strontium concentrations may reach a plateau after about 3 years of treatment. There are no data in patients to demonstrate elimination kinetics of strontium from bone off-therapy.

## Biotransformation

As a divalent cation, strontium is not metabolised. Strontium ranelate does not inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes.

## Elimination

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The elimination of strontium is time and dose independent. The effective half-life of strontium is about 60 hours. Strontium excretion occurs via the kidneys and the gastrointestinal tract. Its plasma clearance is about 12 ml/min (CV 22%) and its renal clearance about 7 ml/min (CV 28%).

## Pharmacokinetics in special populations

Elderly Population pharmacokinetic data showed no relationship between age and apparent clearance of strontium in the target population.

## Renal impairment

In patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (30-70 ml/min creatinine clearance), strontium clearance decreases as creatinine clearance decreases (approximately 30% decrease over the creatinine clearance range 30 to 70 ml/min) and thereby induces an increase in strontium plasma levels. In phase III studies, 85% of the patients had a creatinine clearance between 30 and 70 ml/min and 6% below 30 ml/min at inclusion, and the mean creatinine clearance was about 50 ml/min. No dosage adjustment is therefore required in patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment. There is no pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min).

Hepatic impairment There is no pharmacokinetic data in patients with hepatic impairment. Due to the pharmacokinetic properties of strontium, no effect is expected. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. Chronic oral administration of strontium ranelate at high doses in rodents induced bone and tooth abnormalities, mainly consisting of spontaneous fractures and delayed mineralisation that were reversible after cessation of treatment. These effects were reported at bone strontium levels 2-3 times higher than bone strontium levels in humans up to 3 years of treatment. The data on skeletal strontium ranelate accumulation in longer term exposure is limited. Developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits resulted in bone and tooth abnormalities (e.g. bent long bones and wavy ribs) in the offspring. In rats, these effects were reversible 8 weeks after cessation of treatment. Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) The environmental risk assessment of strontium ranelate has been conducted in accordance European guidelines on ERA. Strontium ranelate does not present a risk for the environment. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Contents of the pack and other information 1. What PROTELOS is and what it is used for PROTELOS is a medicine used to treat severe osteoporosis: -in postmenopausal women, -in adult men, at high risk of fracture, for whom other alternative treatments are not possible. In postmenopausal women, strontium ranelate reduces the risk of  fracture at the spine and at the hip. About osteoporosis Your body is constantly breaking down old bone and making new bone tissue. If you have osteoporosis, your body breaks down more bone than it forms so that gradually bone loss occurs and your bones become thinner and fragile. This is especially common in women after the menopause. Many people with osteoporosis have no symptoms and you may not even know that you have it. However, osteoporosis makes you more likely to have fractures (break bones), especially in your spine, hips and wrists. How PROTELOS works Medicinal product no longer authorised

PROTELOS works by reducing bone breakdown and stimulating rebuilding of bone and therefore reduces the risk of fracture. The newly formed bone is of normal quality.

## 2. What you need to know before you take PROTELOS

## Do not take PROTELOS:

- -if you are allergic  to strontium ranelate or any of the other ingredients of PROTELOS (listed in section 6).
- -if you have or have had a blood clot (for example, in the blood vessels in your legs or lungs).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -if you are immobilised permanently or for some time such as being wheel-chair bound, or confined to bed or if you are to undergo an operation or recovering from an operation. The risk of vein thrombosis (blood clots in the leg or lungs) may be increased in the event of lengthy immobilisation.
- -if  you have established ischaemic heart disease, or cerebrovascular disease, e.g. you have been diagnosed  with  a  h eart  attack, stroke,  or  transient  ischaemic  attack (temporary  reduction  of blood flow to the brain; also know n as 'mini-stroke'), angina, or blockages of blood vessels to the heart or brain.
- -if you have or have had problems with your blood circulation (peripheral arterial disease) or if you have had surgery on the arteries of your legs.
- -if you have high blood pressure not controlled by treatment.

## Warnings and precautions:

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking PROTELOS: -if you are at risk of heart disease, this includes  high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking. -if you are at risk of blood clots. -if you have severe kidney disease. Your doctor will evaluate the conditions of your heart and blood vessels regularly, generally every 6 to 12 months for as long you are taking PROTELOS. During treatment, if you experience an allergic reaction (such as swelling of the face, tongue or throat, difficulty in breathing or swallowing, skin rash), you must immediately stop taking PROTELOS and seek medical advice (see section 4). Potentially life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and severe hypersensitivity reactions (DRESS)) have been reported with the use of PROTELOS. The highest risk of occurrence of serious skin reactions is within the first weeks of treatment for Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis and usually around 3-6 weeks for DRESS. If you develop a rash or serious skin symptoms (see section 4), stop taking PROTELOS, seek urgent advice from a doctor and tell him that you are taking this medicine. If you have developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis or DRESS with the use of PROTELOS, you must not be re-started on PROTELOS at any time If you are of Asian origin, you may be at higher risk of skin reactions. The risk of these skin reactions in patients of Asian origin, particularly Han Chinese, may be predicted. Patients who have the HLA-A*33:03 and/or the HLA-B*58:01 genes are more likely to develop a serious skin reaction than those who do not have the genes. Your doctor should be able to advise if a blood test is necessary before taking PROTELOS. Children and adolescents PROTELOS is not intended for use in children and adolescents (below the age of 18). Other medicines and PROTELOS: Medicinal product no longer authorised

You should stop taking PROTELOS if you have to take oral tetracyclines such as doxycycline or quinolones such as ciprofloxacin (two types of antibiotics). You can take PROTELOS again when you have finished taking these antibiotics. If you are unsure about this ask your doctor or pharmacist. If you are taking medicines containing calcium, you should leave at least 2 hours before you take PROTELOS.

If you take antacids (medicines to relieve heartburn) you should take them at least 2 hours after PROTELOS. If this is not possible, it is acceptable to take the two medicines at the same time. If you need to have blood or urine tests to check your level of calcium, you should tell the laboratory that you are taking PROTELOS as it may interfere with some testing methods.

## PROTELOS with food and drink:
