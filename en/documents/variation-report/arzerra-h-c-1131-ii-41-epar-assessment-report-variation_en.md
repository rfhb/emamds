## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (also referred to as B-CLL) is the most common type of leukaemia in the western  world.  The  incidence  increases  with  age,  is  higher  in  men  than  in  women  and  higher  in Caucasians than in other racial groups.  The median age at presentation is 71 years and 11% of patients are diagnosed under the age of 55 years (Howlader, 2014).

CLL is a haematological neoplasm of unknown aetiology in which peripheral, clonal B-cells progressively accumulate.  The disease is characterized by monomorphic, small, round B-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood,  bone  marrow,  and  lymph  nodes  that  aberrantly  co-express  T-cell  (CD5 + )  and  B-cell  (CD19 + , CD23 + ) cell surface markers, with a low expression of CD20. CLL follows a variable clinical course with overall survival (OS) times ranging from months to decades. Median survival from diagnosis is approximately 10 years in the overall CLL population, but is only 18 months for patients with advanced disease (Nabhan, 2004) and 9 to 13 months for cases refractory to fludarabine (Byrd, 2004). Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is still the only potentially curative treatment for CLL; however it is feasible in only a small minority of CLL patients. Current treatment guidelines from the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) indicate the choice of treatment for previously untreated patients with CLL is based on stage of disease, whether a patient is considered 'fit' and presence or absence of del17p or TP53 mutation (Figure 1).

a Efficacy in CLL relative to first-line therapies other than chlorambucil has not been established. b Used for first- and second-line treatment of CLL. c Information from approved FLUDARA UK SmPC, revision date 14 October 2015

Data from uncontrolled studies using MRD assessment support the concept of maintenance with an antiCD20 antibody (mainly rituximab) for up to 2 years in responding patients with CLL.

Although maintenance therapy in CLL has not been authorized as such, prolonged therapy (until progression or intolerance) with small molecules such as ibrutinib or idelalisib has been approved in a comparable population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Ofatumumab  is  a  human  monoclonal  antibody  (IgG1)  that  binds  specifically  to  a  distinct  epitope encompassing both the small and large extracellular loops of the CD20 molecule. The CD20 molecule is a transmembrane phosphoprotein  expressed on  B  lymphocytes  from  the  pre  B  to  mature  B  lymphocyte stage and on B cell tumours. The B cell tumours include CLL (generally associated with lower levels of CD20  expression)  and  non  Hodgkin's  lymphomas  (where  &gt;90%  tumours  have  high  levels  of  CD20 expression).  The  CD20  molecule  is  not  shed  from  the  cell  surface  and  is  not  internalised  following antibody binding.

The binding of ofatumumab to the membrane proximal epitope of the CD20 molecule induces recruitment and  activation  of  the  complement  pathway  at  the  cell  surface,  leading  to  complement  dependent cytotoxicity and resultant lysis of tumour cells. Ofatumumab has been shown to induce appreciable lysis of cells with high expression levels of complement defence molecules. Ofatumumab has also been shown to induce cell lysis in both high and low CD20 expressing cells and in rituximab resistant cells. In addition, the  binding  of  ofatumumab  allows  the  recruitment  of  natural  killer  cells  allowing  the  induction  of  cell death through antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (SmPC section 5.1).

The current indication for Arzerra is as follows: Previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL): Arzerra in combination with chlorambucil or bendamustine is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have not received prior therapy and who are not eligible for fludarabine based therapy. Refractory CLL: Arzerra  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  CLL  in  adult  patients  who  are  refractory  to  fludarabine  and alemtuzumab. The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) applied for the following indication: Maintenance therapy in CLL Arzerra is indicated as maintenance treatment for adult patients with CLL who are in complete or partial response after at least two lines of induction therapy. 2.2. Non-clinical aspects No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 2.3. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment An updated environmental risk assessment, consisting of a justification for not submitting ERA studies, has  been  provided.  This  is  in  accordance  with  the  'Guideline  on  environmental  risk  assessment  of medicinal  products  for  human  use'  (EMEA/EHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr  2 1 * ),  as  proteins  are  unlikely  to result in a significant risk to the environment.

Pharmacokinetics The MAH did not submit new phase II dose finding PK/PD studies for the current application. The PK data supporting the dose selection is based on clinical experience with the 1000 mg dose in prior and ongoing clinical trials as well as in PK modelling and simulation. The initial dose of 300 mg was used to minimize infusion reactions. A 1000 mg dose was administered 1 week later to increase ofatumumab concentrations further during the first 8-week cycle. Modelling and simulation of the proposed dosing regimen based on early PK data in subjects with CLL indicated that the dosing regimen was expected to achieve prolonged exposure to plasma concentrations above the target level (&gt;10 μg/mL) in a high proportion of patients with CLL who were in response after induction therapy. The target level was based on preclinical studies to identify the OFA concentrations sufficient to suppress peripheral B-cell recovery in cynomolgus monkey as well as suppress tumour cell growth in Daudi tumour-bearing SCID mice (Bleeker, 2008).

Figure 2. Mean ofatumumab plasma concentration-time curves (Study OMB112517) Ofatumumab PK results from a phase I study (OMB112758) in Japanese and South Korean subjects with CLL were consistent with those seen in Western subjects with CLL. A trend of longer PFS was observed with higher ofatumumab AUC and was also noted with Cmax and Ctrough at certain time points. Univariate analyses found that higher Cmax at Cycle 1 Week 1; AUC at Cycle  1  Week  1,  Cycle  1  Week  2,  and  Cycle  4;  and  Ctrough  at  Cycle  1  Week  2  and  Cycle  4  were associated with longer PFS. In multivariate analyses, ofatumumab AUC values at Cycle 1 Week 1, Cycle 1 Week 2, and Cycle 4 were significantly associated with PFS after adjustment for disease factors that are known to affect clinical outcome. Ofatumumab  had  a  small  volume  of  distribution,  consistent  with  distribution  largely  in  the  systemic circulation. In Study OMB112517, the geometric mean Vss value was 6.0 L at Cycle 4 (1000 mg), which is consistent with Vss values observed in other studies in CLL. Population pharmacokinetics A population PK model has been used to characterize the PK of ofatumumab after intravenous infusion in subjects  with  CLL  receiving  maintenance  ofatumumab  every  two  months  after  responding  to induction therapy. The model was revised based on studies in refractory CLL (Study OMB111773/Hx-CD20-406), rheumatoid arthritis  (RA,  Study  Hx-CD20-403),  relapsed/refractory  follicular  lymphoma  (FL,  Study  HxCD20- 001), and relapsed/refractory CLL (Study Hx-CD20-402).

The population PK dataset from Study OMB112517 included 2192 observations from 224 subjects after exclusions.  A  total  of  30  observations  out  of  2222  results  were  excluded  from  the  final  analysis  as anomalous values or due to missing dosing records.

Individual PK parameter values were determined for each subject. Cmax, Ctrough, and tmax values were based on the observed concentration-time data for each dose in each cycle. AUC(0-τ) values were calculated for each subject by integrating the predicted concentrations over the dosing interval until the next dose using NONMEM (planned: AUC(0-168 hr) for Cycle 1 Week 1; AUC(0-1176 hr) for Cycle 1 Week

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2; and AUC(0-1344 hr) for Cycle 2 and later). Total clearance (CLtot) for Cycle 4 and later was calculated based on the AUC(0-τ). Steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) was determined by individual post hoc parameters. Half-life (t½) values were determined based on the individual post hoc parameters and CLtot values using standard equations.

## Results and evaluation

The parameter estimates for the previously developed OFA PPK model is given in Table 5. Individual post hoc parameter estimates are provided in Table 6.

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

PD has been assessed in terms of CD5+, CD19+, CD20+ and CD23+ counts:

Study OMB112517: In subjects receiving ofatumumab maintenance treatment, the median decreases in CD5 + CD19 + cell counts after the first cycle and prior to the sixth eight-week cycle were 61% and 80%; in the observation arm, the median changes in CD5 + CD19 +  cell counts at the same time points were increases of 32% and 1328%.

Figure 5: CD5+CD19+ B-Cell Counts over Time by Subject (Study OMB112758)

Study OMB111827/GEN416: In the total group, the median percent reduction in peripheral blood CD5 + CD19 +  cells was 91% one week after the eighth weekly infusion (Week 8) and 90% before the second monthly infusion (Month 4).  In the double refractory group, the median percent reduction was 97% and 94% at Week 8 and Month 4, respectively, while, in the bulky fludarabine-refractory group, the median percent reduction was 67% and 73% at the same timepoints.

## Primary and secondary pharmacology

## Immunogenicity

Study OMB112517 : In the 205 subjects with post-ofatumumab HAHA results one subject  tested positive for  HAHA,  and  185  subjects  had  all negative  post-ofatumumab  HAHA  results  with  at  least  one ofatumumab  plasma  concentration  low  enough  (&lt;200 µ g/mL)  for  the  negative  HAHA  results  to  be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

considered conclusive.  For the subject tested positive for HAHA, at the six-month follow-up visit (titer = 16); samples at all other time points were negative.

Study  OMB111827/GEN416: There  were  no  positive  results  for  HAHA  in  the  study  using  the  enzymelinked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  method.  Post-ofatumumab  HAHA  results  were  available  for  21 subjects.  Of these 21 subjects, 3 subjects were negative for HAHA, and 18 were inconclusive due to the presence of ofatumumab.

Study OMB112758: There were no detectable anti-ofatumumab antibodies (HAHA) in samples collected from all ten subjects after the administration of ofatumumab using the G2 MSD ECL assay. Ofatumumab concentrations were below the drug tolerance of the assay at the time of HAHA sample collection in seven subjects.

The estimated concentration levels show a Cmean above the target exposure of 10μg/ml. Although the probability of attaining a trough concentration of at least 10 µg/mL at steady-state (Cycle 4 and later) was  approximately  50%,  there  does  not  seem  to  be  a  systematic  trend  for  individual  patients  to consistently fall below the target concentration during the entire study period.

2.4.4. PK/PD modelling Not applicable. 2.4.5. Discussion on clinical pharmacology The sponsor did not submit new phase II dose finding PK/PD studies for the current application. The PK data supporting the dose selection is based on prior and ongoing clinical experience with the proposed doses, preclinical identification of a target level of 10 μg/ml and PK modelling and simulation. Sparse PK data has been collected in the pivotal study OMB112517 to confirm that the expected exposure levels is reached. The clinical pharmacology of ofatumumab in CLL has been previously well defined. New data presented in this submission do not alter the understanding of ofatumumab PK, PD, or immunogenicity. The PK profile of ofatumumab in CLL patients in partial or complete response after induction treatment is generally in line  with  what  previously  reported  in  other  indications.  However,  the  exposures  are  somewhat  higher than expected compared to previous studies in CLL patients, which could be due to reduced contribution of target- mediated clearance, as the subjects entering this study is in complete or partial response after induction  treatment.  The  immunogenicity  is  reported  as  low,  and  potential  contribution  of  ADA  to  the elimination  of  ofatumumab  is  not  expected  to  differ  from  other  indications.  The  previously  developed population PK model reasonable well predict the PK data in the current population (CLL patients in partial of complete response after induction therapy), however some miss specification is present, as the model slightly, but systematically, overestimates the concentrations. In  the  submitted  PK  data  from  the  pivotal  trial,  some  exposure  response  correlations  have  been identified, and there is a trend for higher efficacy (PFS) in the quartiles with higher exposure (AUC, Cmax and Ctrough). It is difficult to know the causality, as efficacy of the drug will result in a decreasing level of B-cells, which will cause decreased ofatumumab CL. Medicinal product no longer authorised

It  is  of  course  acknowledged  that  a  higher  number  of  B-cells  result  in  a  greater  component  of  targetmediated elimination, faster clearance, and shorter ofatumumab OFA half-life compared to a low B-cell count setting. This makes the relationship between ofatumumab exposure and clinical response complex, and the relationship has not been fully characterized. However, the data available does not allow a clear

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

identification of a target exposure and a recommendation for dose adjustments at later Cycles or between PR of CR patients cannot be made.

## 2.4.6. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The  dose  selection  based  on  preclinical  data  with  ofatumumab,  prior  experience  with  rituximab  and ofatumumab as well as population PK modelling and simulation with the existing ofatumumab populationPK model is acceptable.

2.5. Clinical efficacy 2.5.1. Dose response studies No specific dose-finding studies for the maintenance therapy have been conducted (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). 2.5.2.

For females in the USA, the use of a double barrier method is also considered adequate (condom or occlusive cap plus spermicidal agent).

Treatments The  study  consisted  of  screening,  a  Treatment/Obs  Phase,  and  a  Follow-up  Phase.  Disease  status assessments to determine response or disease progression were done approximately every 8 weeks for up to 2 years for both arms (per National Cancer Institute [NCI] criteria) during the Treatment/Obs Phase and to include: · Physical examination including lymph node examination, spleen and liver measurement, and detection of constitutional symptoms · Peripheral blood sample evaluation of complete blood count (CBC) and differential (expressed in % and absolutes). Subjects in the maintenance arm (Arm A) were given ofatumumab by IV infusion as follows: first infusion of 300 mg OFA on Day 1, second infusion of 1000 mg OFA on Day 8, followed by infusions of 1000 mg OFA every 8 weeks for up to 2 years. Prior to the start of each ofatumumab infusion, subjects received acetaminophen, antihistamine, and glucocorticoids for premedication. Dose reductions or modifications of ofatumumab were not permitted unless for subject safety (i.e., due to infusion reactions). If a dose delay was  required  for  ofatumumab  for  safety  (including  AEs),  dosing  may  have  resumed  at  physician discretion and the subject was still considered to be in remission.  Subjects in the control Obs arm (Arm B) received no further treatment, which is the current standard of care. The visit schedule was identical for the ofatumumab maintenance and Obs arms. Subjects were randomized to treatment arms A or B as follows: Arm A: Medicinal product no longer authorised

Abbreviations: CLL=chronic lymphocytic leukemia; F/U = follow-up; tx=therapy(ies). Figure 6: Design of Study OMB112517 Follow-up phase Survival  and  disease  status  assessments  (physical  examination  and  evaluation  of  peripheral  blood samples) was planned to be performed post treatment every 3 months for 5 years after last treatment. A bone marrow examination is required to confirm CR at least 2 months after completion of therapy and when a subject fulfils  the  International  Workshop  for  Chronic  Lymphocytic  Leukemia  (IWCLL)  updated National Cancer Institute-Sponsored Working Group (NCI-WG) requirements for CR. Previous results may be  used  or  if  not  available,  a  bone  marrow  exam  may  be  done  at  screening.  If  a  subject's  response improves to a CR while on study, then a bone marrow examination is required to confirm CR at least 2 months after response as per the updated IWCLL NCI-WG requirements for CR. Additionally,  CT  Scans  were  required  yearly  while on  study,  including  during follow-up,  and  at  disease progression, whenever that may occur. Subjects demonstrating disease progression were supposed to be followed for survival status until study completion. Follow-up assessment after disease progression on treatment was planned to assess survival status, date of next CLL therapy, type of therapy and response to therapy. Objectives The  primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  progression  free  survival  (PFS)  of  subjects  treated  with ofatumumab  maintenance  treatment  compared  to  no  further  treatment  after  remission  induction  in subjects with relapsed chronic CLL. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Secondary objectives included the following:

To  evaluate  the  improvement  in  response,  improvement  in  response  time  to  next  CLL  treatment  and overall survival in subjects receiving ofatumumab maintenance compared to no further treatment.

To evaluate the PFS after next-line therapy and the time to progression after next line therapy.

To evaluate the safety and tolerability in subjects with CLL receiving ofatumumab maintenance compared to no further treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To  evaluate  the  health-related  quality  of  life  in  subjects  with  CLL  receiving  ofatumumab  maintenance compared to no further treatment as assessed by changes in patient reported outcome (PRO) measures relative to baseline.

To  evaluate  prognostic  marker  correlation with clinical response  in subjects with CLL  receiving ofatumumab maintenance compared to no further treatment.

To evaluate ofatumumab PK parameters in subjects with CLL receiving maintenance ofatumumab every 2 months.

The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint, PFS, using the following assumptions:

- Exponential survival curves where the ratio of the hazard rates is constant over time
- Median PFS for the no further treatment group is 28 months

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Median PFS for the ofatumumab maintenance treatment group is 39.2 months
- A 1:1 stratified randomization scheme
- A 5% two-sided risk of erroneously claiming a difference in the presence of no true underlying difference (alpha level)
- An  80%  chance  of  successfully  declaring  a  difference  in  the  presence  of  a  true  underlying difference (power)
- Accrual rate of 12 subjects per month

· Stratified Log-rank test for hypothesis testing Using the above assumptions, approximately 280 total events from both treatment arms are needed for the study to attain 80% power. With a total sample size of 478 evaluable subjects, the total duration of the study will be approximately 63.5 months in order to obtain the 280 total events. Assuming a drop-out rate of 10%, the total sample size for both arms combined will be about 532 and the total duration of the study will be approximately 68 months. Randomisation Subjects were randomized to ofatumumab maintenance versus Obs arms in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization was stratified based on the following factors: 1) CR or PR at study entry, 2) number of previous induction treatments  (two  vs.  three)  and  3)  type  of  prior  treatment  (chemo  immunotherapy,  only  alkylating monotherapy, or other treatment). Blinding (masking) The design was an open-label study. Statistical methods Hypotheses The  null  and  alternative  hypotheses  were  designed  with  the  goal  of  demonstrating  the  superiority  of ofatumumab maintenance treatment over no further treatment after remission induction in subjects with relapsed chronic CLL. The following hypotheses were to be evaluated: H0:  Distribution  of  PFS  curves  for  the  ofatumumab  maintenance  treatment  and  for  the  no  further treatment groups are the same (HR is equal to 1). H1: Distribution  of  the  PFS  curves  for  the  ofatumumab  maintenance  treatment  and  for  the  no  further treatment groups are not the same (HR is not equal to 1).

## Analysis Populations

The following analysis populations were defined for this study:

- Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population: all subjects randomized in the study; subjects were grouped based on randomized arm regardless of which treatment they received
- Safety population: all  randomized subjects; used for safety analyses; subjects were grouped based on treatment received regardless of how they were randomized

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Per Protocol (PP) population: all randomized subjects excluding those with major protocol deviations that impacted efficacy
- PK population: of all subjects in the ITT population for whom a PK sample was obtained and analysed.

## Planned Analyses

The analysis of the primary endpoint was planned when the total number of events (280 PFS events/deaths) was reached in the study. An additional analysis was planned to be performed after all patients had completed follow-up or had been withdrawn.

The final analysis of PFS was planned to be tested based on a two-sided test with a significance level of 0.0498. The survival distributions should be estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and compared using  a  stratified  log-rank  test.  In  addition  to  the  stratified  log-rank  test  based  on  the  Kaplan-Meier procedure,  a  Cox  regression  model  should  be  used  and  include  covariates  for  treatment,  stratification factors,  and  other  baseline  data  deemed  appropriate  ( i.e .  cytogenetics  at  baseline,  IgVH  mutational status at baseline, β2-microglobulin at baseline, baseline CD20 and baseline complement level). Subgroup analyses Summary tables for PFS would be provided by the baseline stratification factors. Other subgroups of interest include age (&lt;70 vs ≥70), gender, race, RAI/Binet Stage, ECOG (0-1 vs 2), baseline cytogenetics, cytogenetics at relapse, prognostic factors (Beta-2 microglobulin, IgVh status), baseline lymphocyte count and MRD status. Sensitivity analyses Three sensitivity analyses of PFS were planned: · Using the IRC response data as opposed to using investigator assessment of response. · Using the investigator response data where events of progression determined by CT scan will be included in the analysis. · Using  sensitivity  data  generated  by  the  IRC  where  CT  scan  data  was  used  to  determine progression. Efficacy Analyses Assessments of disease status were based on IWCLL updated NCI-WG CLL criteria, with primary assessments based on investigator assessment and IRC assessments used for sensitivity analyses.  The ITT population was used for all efficacy endpoint analyses. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The investigator assessment of response was used for the primary analysis of PFS, defined as the interval from randomization until disease progression or death.  The length of the PFS interval was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death or PD, whichever occurred first.  Events of disease progression determined by CT scan were excluded from the primary analysis (but were included in a sensitivity analysis of PFS).  The algorithm for whether or not a subject was classified as progressed or censored is presented in OMB112517 RAP Section 11.1. PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and compared between arms with a stratified log-rank test using pre-specified baseline stratification factors:  1) CR or PR at study entry, 2) number of previous induction treatments (two vs. three) and 3) type of prior treatment (chemoimmunotherapy, only alkylating monotherapy, or other). The Pike estimator of the treatment hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the HR were also provided. Kaplan-Meier plots, median times to PFS, and first and third quartiles were presented along with 95% CIs and associated probabilities for the effect of treatment, stratification factors, and the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

covariates.  The HR for treatment expressed the risk of experiencing disease progression or death for the OFA maintenance arm versus Obs.

A PP sensitivity analysis of PFS was not done as PP and ITT populations differed by &lt;10%.  Three other planned sensitivity analyses of PFS were performed. Concordance between investigator and IRC assessments of progression was evaluated for both arms based on percent agreement.  The number and percentage of subjects with investigator-assessed progression during the Treatment/Obs Phase and follow-up was summarized for both arms.

Subgroup analyses of investigator-assessed PFS were conducted using a log-rank test: Response at entry (CR, PR); Number of previous induction therapies (two, three); Type of prior treatment (chemoimmunotherapy, only alkylating therapy, other); Age (&lt;70, ≥70); Gender (male, female); Race (White, non-White); Modified Rai stage at screening (low risk, intermediate risk, high risk); Binet Stage at screening (A, B, C); Baseline cytogenetics with 20% cut-off (17p-, 11q-, 6q- or 12q or 13q-, no aberration); Baseline cytogenetics with 12% cut-off; Cytogenetics at relapse with 20% cut-off; Cytogenetics at relapse with 12% cut-off; Baseline MRD status (negative, positive).

## PFS with Events Based on CT Scans Included

Investigator-assessed PFS replacing palpated measurements of lymph nodes and organs with CT scan measurements (ofatumumab maintenance: 24.54 months, observation: 12.98 months) resulted in marginally shorter PFS than the primary endpoint of investigator-assessed PFS. The HR for the updated sensitivity analysis of 0.58 (95% CI=0.45, 0.75; p&lt;0.0001).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## PFS with IRC Sensitivity Scans

This sensitivity analysis was conducted using data generated by the IRC, where palpitation was replaced with CT scans to determine progression.  The updated analysis resulted in a shorter PFS than the primary endpoint (ofatumumab maintenance: 23.69 months, observation: 13.54 months).  The HR for this sensitivity analysis of 0.66 (95% CI=0.50, 0.87; p=0.0021)

## PFS During Follow-Up

At the time of the data cut-off of 19 June 2014, 99 subjects had completed 2 years in the Treatment/Obs Phase, and the proportion of subjects that had progression at that time was similar between arms (ofatumumab maintenance: 32%, observation: 33%).  The number of subjects included in this analysis was based on exposure data for the ofatumumab maintenance arm and based on visit data for the observation arm.

PFS at One Year Two subjects had only 1 year of dosing, therefore, comparison of PFS with subjects completing the protocol-defined 2 years of dosing is not meaningful. Secondary Efficacy Results Response rate All subjects were in remission at study entry; therefore, improvement in response during the study could only  occur  in  those  subjects  who  were  in  PR  at  baseline  (ofatumumab  maintenance:  193  subjects, observation: 189 subjects). At the time of the data cut-off, only a small proportion of subjects in either arm  had  an  improvement  in  response  from  PR  to  CR  during  the  course  of  the  study  (ofatumumab maintenance: 6% [11/193], observation: 1% [2/189]). However, confirmatory bone marrow biopsy after screening was obtained in only 7% of the subjects.

The median PFS after next-line therapy has not yet been met. Exploratory Efficacy Results B-Symptoms The majority of subjects (OFA maintenance: 94%, Obs: 94%) had no B-symptoms at baseline because subjects were required to be in remission at study entry. Up to the data cut-off date, most subjects continued to have no B-symptoms during the course of the study. Minimal Residual Disease Overall, 316 subjects were assessed for MRD at baseline (56/91 subjects in CR and 260/382 subjects in PR). Of 28 subjects in CR randomized to OFA maintenance with a baseline MRD sample, 39% (11 subjects) were MRD-negative at baseline and 42% (13 subjects) were MRD-negative at any visit.

Figure 19: Mean Change from Baseline of EORTC QLQ-CLL 30 with 95% CI - C30 Global Health Score/HRQoL (ITT Population - Study OMB112517) Ancillary analyses Efficacy results in patients at high risk for relapse To identify  high  risk  patients,  the  following  parameters  were  considered:  duration of  remission  to  first induction therapy, response to therapy prior to study entry, and the international Prognostic Index for patients with CLL (CLL-IPI). The CLL-IPI has been proposed by Kutsch, et al (2015) because the clinical staging systems (Rai/Binet) do not accurately discriminate between prognostic groups given the availability of new and more effective treatments for CLL. While there are several new prognostic markers, there is no system that integrates the major clinical, biological and genetic variables into one widely accepted score. The authors performed a  comprehensive  meta-analysis  of  26  prognostic  factors  to  develop  an  internationally  applicable prognostic index for CLL patients. The full analysis set (FAS) was collected from 8 phase 3 trials (3472 treatment-naive patients at early and advanced stage with a median age of 61 years (range 27 - 86) and a  median  observation  time  of  80  months.  The  FAS  was  randomly  divided  into  training  and  internal validation datasets [TD, 2308 (67%); IVD, 1164 (33%)]. Methods of multivariable statistics were applied; the main endpoint was OS and the model was externally validated in a third dataset comprised of 845 newly diagnosed CLL patients from the Mayo Clinic with a median age of 62 years (range 25 - 89) and a median observation time of 63 months. Based on 1192 (52%) patients from the training dataset, five independent predictors for OS were identified: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- age;
- del(17p) and/or TP53 mutation;
- β2-microglobulin (B2M) level;
- clinical stage;
- Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain Variable Region Genes (IgHV) mutation status.

Risk group Each patient group had a significantly different OS [93%, 79%, 64% and 23% OS at 5 years for the low to very high risk group respectively, p &lt;0.001; C-statistic c = 0.72 (95% CI, 0.69-0.76)]. Treatment recommendations based on CLL-IPI combining the most important genetic risk factors ( IgHV , del(17p)/ TP53 mutation) with clinical stage, age and B2M levels suggest treating patients with High and Very High risk subgroups, hereafter referred to as High risk group. Approximately 30% of patients are in the high risk group: 78 patients (33%) in the ofatumumab arm and 64 patients (26%) in the observation arm, respectively. · Table -6 Subgroups in the PROLONG study based on CLL-IPI Subject disposition, median exposure, baseline characteristics Subject Disposition and exposure The disposition of subjects in the High risk group is similar to that in the overall population ( Table 1-3 ). The median treatment duration for High risk group subjects in the ofatumumab maintenance arm was 318.5 days (1 day to 815 days); 28% received at least 10 cycles of treatment. · Table 1-7  Treatment disposition and exposure to treatment Medicinal product no longer authorised

The subjects in this group are representative of a high risk population; most baseline characteristics are balanced between arms (Table 1-5) with the exception of minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity and IgHV unmutated status, which both favour the observation arm. The patients in the High risk group are older  patients  (median  age  71  year  old;  approximately  75%  &gt;65  years),  with  a  majority  in  advanced Binet and Rai stages; in both arms, 78% of patients had B2M levels &gt;3500 µg/L. MRD status showed positive  MRD  for  82%  vs.  59%  of  patients  in  the  ofatumumab  and  observation  arms,  respectively; unmutated IgHV status was present in for 90% vs. 83% of patients in the ofatumumab and observation arms, respectively. Furthermore, analysis of duration of response to the first induction therapy (Table 1-4) shows that 68% of subjects in the high risk group have a short remission or an early relapse (&lt;24 months), similar to the overall population (62%). · Table -8 Duration of response to first induction therapy Long Remission (Duration ≥ 24 months) Short Remission (Duration &lt;24 months) Missing Duration Total · Table -9 Baseline Characteristics Age Median Range ≤ 65 &gt;65 &lt;70 Medicinal product no longer authorised

Clinical relevance of observed effects Primary endpoint: PFS The median PFS in the ofatumumab arm was 23.23 months compared with 5.5 months in the observation arm  and  demonstrates  that  the  patients  in  the  High  risk  group  derive  more  prolonged  benefit  from maintenance treatment with ofatumumab compared with observation ( Figure 1-1 ). The HR was 0.47 (0.31, 0.71) with a statistically significant p-value of &lt;0.0001. Table -10  Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS according to Investigator Medicinal product no longer authorised

Three  sensitivity  analyses  of  the  primary  PFS  endpoint  for  the  High  risk  group  were  conducted:  per Independent  Review  Committee  (IRC)  assessment,  per  Investigator  assessment  where  CT  scans  were considered,  and  per  IRC  assessment  where  CT  scans  were  considered  ( Table  1-7 ).  The  PFS  by  IRC  is supportive of the primary endpoint with a median PFS of 23.23 months compared with 7.39 months in the observation arm. The HR was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.85).

A shorter median PFS was observed when CT scans are considered, based on both investigator-assessed and  IRC-assessed  PFS.  However,  the  PFS  benefit  still  favours  the  ofatumumab  arm  with  robustness demonstrated  in  HRs  ranging  from  0.55  to  0.67,  similar  to  the  PFS  benefit  observed  in  the  overall population.

Secondary efficacy endpoint: overall survival As discussed previously, OS is difficult to demonstrate in patients with CLL with expected long survival post progression and with many next line therapies taken upon progression to confound the result. In addition, in this high risk group as in the general population of PROLONG, imbalance in several baseline prognostic factors put ofatumumab at a disadvantage, specifically, MRD status showed positive MRD for 82% vs. 59% of patients in the ofatumumab and observation arms, respectively; unmutated IgHV status was present in for 90% vs. 83% of patients in the ofatumumab and observation arms, respectively. The  OS  analysis  between  the  two  randomised  arms  for  the  High  risk  group  ( Figure  1-3 )  showed  that approximately 40% of the High risk patients had an event; the HR is 0.86 with 95% CI (0.51, 1.48). · Table -12  Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Secondary endpoint: Time to Next Therapy or Death

The median time to next therapy or death favours ofatumumab with a prolongation of approximately 7 months.  The  Physician's  decision  to  start  next  therapy  likely  considered  all  sources  of  evidence  for progression,  including  CT  scans.  This  may  explain  why  the  median  Time  to  Next  Therapy  or  Death (TTNToD)  is  shorter  than  the  observed  median  PFS.  However,  the  PFS  sensitivity  analysis  taking  into account CT scans shows concordant results between PFS and TTNToD.

Even though the CLL-IPI guideline recommends treatment for the High risk group only in the presence of symptoms, we need to keep in mind that the recommendation is for treatment-naïve patients, and the recommended  treatment  is  induction  therapy.  For  patients  receiving  maintenance  treatment  in  the PROLONG study, it is conceivable that all would have presented with an indication for treatment according to the IWCLL guidelines prior to their previous re-induction treatment. Subsequently, all subjects entered the trial in remission, therefore it was not expected that they would present with symptoms at baseline. As  seen  in  Table  1-3,  these  subjects  do  not  have  a  deep  remission  (&gt;90%  PR  response  to  last treatment), the majority does not have MRD negative status (&gt;70% positive), and has poor prognostic factors (78% with B2M &gt;3500 µg/L, 87% with IgHV unmutated). As expected in this patient population, there were not many subjects with B-symptoms at baseline in the High risk group (6% in both arms) or in the overall population. However, a trend of B-symptoms control favouring the ofatumumab arm is apparent (Table 1-10). This is evident for subjects who did not have Bsymptoms at baseline and then became symptomatic during the treatment/observation period, in 10% of ofatumumab  subjects  and  in 27%  of  observation subjects. Therefore, the benefit of receiving ofatumumab maintenance regarding B-symptoms control was clearly evident in the High risk group. · Table -14  Summary of shift from baseline in B-symptoms Medicinal product no longer authorised

The choice of 'no treatment' as comparator was accepted by the SAWP (2009). In fact, even in the current, expanding treatment landscape (with the introduction of protein kinase inhibitors), 'notreatment' might still be the most relevant option for patients in the intervals between relapses and induction therapies. In this particular disease, where initiation of treatment upon relapse is rather individual and to a large extent dependent on symptoms, the patient might experience 'loss of chance' by being treated with the maintenance agent when a symptomatic relapse arise at a later stage.

2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy Design and conduct of clinical studies To support the request, the applicant submitted efficacy data from an interim analysis of one single clinical trial, OMB112517 (PROLONG). The OMB112517 trial was a Phase III, open-label, randomised, multi-centre trial of ofatumumab (OFA) maintenance treatment versus no further treatment in subjects with relapsed CLL who have responded to induction therapy (n=474). Of note, patients that were resistant to fludarabine were excluded from the trial. Medicinal product no longer authorised

To avoid bias introduced by the open-label design of the study, an independent review committee (IRC) and an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) was used. Still, the investigators' judgement might have been influenced and biased by knowing the patients maintenance treatment/no-maintenance treatment status.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary endpoint is PFS as assessed by the investigator. The choice of primary endpoint was thoroughly discussed by the SAWP in an advice given in 2009. According to guidelines, PFS is an acceptable primary endpoint, as long as OS is reported as a secondary endpoint in situations where there is a long expected survival after progression and/or further lines of treatment with effect on OS may hamper the detection of a relevant treatment effect on OS. However, in the setting of maintenance treatment this might be different. Relapse on treatment with ofatumumab signifies resistance to the experimental agent and is likely to be predictive of reduced activity of rituximab. It may be predictive of reduced activity also of pharmacologically non-related medicinal products. Events on therapy in the experimental arm are thus likely to have a different meaning to those in the control arm.

PFS was accepted as primary endpoint by the SAWP, but it should be supported by OS and other endpoints, in particular 'time to need for next line therapy or death' and PFS2. In the present trial, to achieve interpretable survival data according to the SAWP advice, the sample size is not considered sufficient to provide robust interpretable OS data. Altogether 666 evaluable patients would have been needed to reach a power of 80% with a study duration of more than 7 years at an event rate of 382. The SAWP advised against performing a second IA, but if to be performed, not until 2/3 events had occurred. The company chose a follow-up period of 5 yrs. Yet, the study was prematurely terminated based on the results from the 2nd pre-planned IA, based on PFS. In addition, enrolment was stopped (Amendment 5 of the study protocol) and fewer (474 instead of 532) patients than planned were included in the study. Consequently, the assessment of OS will be nearly un-informative due to an unacceptably low power to detect a meaningful survival difference. The study protocol included no stopping rule for efficacy; therefore at the time point of the 2nd IA the IDMC reported a significant difference for PFS and advised to continue the study as planned under the assumption that this would not result in stopping of enrolment. The protocol amendment which resulted in the cessation of enrolment (Amendment 5) was not in place before two months after these results were reported to the company but before the database lock. This gives raise to uncertainties related to the statistical robustness of the trial. However, recruitment was slower than expected, events accumulated faster than expected, the number for the pre-specified IA was reached before full enrolment, the IA showed a greater than assumed treatment effect, and thus the MAH considered that it would be unethical to enrol further subjects. The Applicant following the SAG recommendation (see section below), provided data from a subgroup of patients defined as high risk and very high risk patients according to the international Prognostic Index for patients with CLL (CLL-IPI) as proposed by Kutsch, et al (2015). The CLL-IPI system is based on a comprehensive meta-analysis of 26 prognostic factors to develop an internationally applicable prognostic index  for  CLL  patients.  Data  were  collected  from  treatment-naive  patients  and  by  methods  of multivariable  statistics,  five  independent  predictors  for  OS  were  identified;  age,  del(17p)  and/or  TP53 mutation,  β2-microglobulin  (B2M)  level,  clinical  stage  and  IgHV  mutation  status.  The  model  was externally  validated  in  a  third  dataset  comprised  of  845  newly  diagnosed  CLL  patients  from  the  Mayo Clinic. Based on an algorithm, patients were grouped into low, intermediate, high and very high risk, and recommendations for initiating induction therapy was made. The CLL-IPI system is new and it remains to be seen to what degree it will be taken into clinical use and further validated. However, this definition of a higher risk group seems relevant with the present knowledge of prognostic factors in CLL. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

A statistically significant improvement in the investigator-assessed PFS was observed for the ofatumumab maintenance arm compared with the Obs arm, HR 0.50, p&lt;0.0001; with a median PFS of 29.44 months in the ofatumumab maintenance arm compared with 15.24 months in the Obs arm. However, the efficacy data supporting the present application are based on the pre-defined interim analysis of efficacy and safety performed by the IDMC. Updated PFS analysis continues to support the primary findings.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The median OS has not been reached in any arm. Due to the nature of the disease and the short median follow-up time of only 19.1 month, this is not unexpected. Since enrolment has stopped, up-dated survival data will be based on the same number of patients as this 2nd IA. OS data remain immature even with the 8 months update, with only 19.4% of patient deaths reported across the two arms. Of the 480 patients constituting the Safety Population, 51 patients (21.3%) and 42 patients (17.4%) from the ofatumumab and observation groups, respectively, died. The OS data may have been confounded by some imbalances favouring the observation group, Another key secondary endpoint is time to start of next treatment. The difference in median PFS (ofatumumab 29.44 mo, Obs 15.24 mo, gain 14.2 mo) was not translated into a subsequently longer median 'time to next anti-cancer therapy' (TTNT) (ofatumumab 37.98 mo, Obs 31.11 mo, gain 6.9 mo). The MAH was asked discuss whether these findings can be explained by bias caused by the open-label design of the study or whether maintenance treatment with ofatumumab might have led to more aggressive tumors. The MAH has provided an analysis showing that TTNT was confounded by several factors: 1) in the PFS analysis death is considered an event, while in the TTNT analysis death is censored, 2) a sensitivity analysis incorporating death as an event in TTNT analysis showed that TTNT was postponed by 10.5 months in favour of the OFA arm (35.4 months ofatumumab vs. 24.9 months Observation), 3) TTNT seems to also be influenced by clinical practice. Some investigators gave next treatment without any evidence of progression of disease. This occurred much more often in the ofatumumab arm than in the Obs arm.  Sensitivity analyses in the overall population show that TTNT is delayed by more than 10 months in favour of the ofatumumab arm, therefore part of the discrepancy in the gains of the variables PFS and TTNT can be explained by differences in statistical handling. However, the estimates appear to be influenced by differences in clinical practice (and could at least partly be in violation of the study protocol) and the question of investigator bias in this open label trial cannot be completely ruled out. Data from other secondary endpoints as PFS2 and B-cell monitoring are too immature at present to add any support to the PFS result. Data on changes in MRD status are also based on few patients and results should be interpreted with caution. No detrimental effect was shown by the PRO data, nor could the opposite be concluded due to the openlabel design of the study. Applying  the  CLL-IPI  scoring  algorithm  to  the  PROLONG  study  showed  that  approximately  30%  of patients were in the high or very high risk group (hereafter defined as a 'high risk' group); 78 patients (33%) in the ofatumumab arm and 64 patients (26%) in the observation arm, respectively. The vast majority of the patients included in this 'high risk' group were in the high risk category, and only 2 % in the  very  high  risk.  The  Applicant  also  looked  into  duration  of  response  to  the  first  induction  therapy, which did not differ to a large extent from the overall population, as 68% of patients in the 'high risk' group had a short remission or an early relapse (&lt;24 months) versus 62% in the overall population. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Since,  this  newly  identified  'high  risk'  group  constitutes  a  post-hoc  defined  subgroup,  imbalances between  arms  are  to  be  expected.  This  increases  the  chance  that  any  uncertainties  related  to  the statistical analysis in the overall population, will be further accentuated in this subgroup.

In the new subgroup defined as 'high risk', the median PFS in the ofatumumab arm was 23.2 months compared  with  5.5  months  in  the  observation  arm  (HR  0.47  [0.31,  0.71],  p-value  &lt;0.0001).  The sensitivity analyses of PFS by IRC is supportive of the primary endpoint (median 23.2 months OFA vs. 7.4 months Obs, HR 0.55 [95% CI: 0.35, 0.85]). A significantly shorter median PFS was observed when CT scans were considered, based on both investigator-assessed and IRC-assessed PFS, but with HRs ranging from 0.55 to 0.67. In the OS analysis approximately 40% of the patients in the subgroup had an event,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

but also in this subgroup, no differences in OS can be seen (HR 0.86 [0.51, 1.48]). The OS data are still regarded as immature.

The  median  TTNToD  showed  a  prolongation  of  approximately  7  months  with  ofatumumab  treatment (median months OFA 18.8 vs. 11.5 Obs, HR 0.54 [0.36, 0.83]). The PFS2 was analysed as suggested by the CHMP, taking all progressions and all deaths into consideration, ignoring censoring rules due to large gap between observed event and last adequate tumour assessment. With approximately 40% events, mainly deaths, the numbers are still immature, KM medians are 43.8 and 33.2 months (HR 0.79 [95% CI: 0.47, 1.33]).

The ORR after next line therapy is comparable between arms, but also here data are still immature and no firm conclusions can be drawn. In the 'high risk' group, 6% in both arms had B-symptoms at baseline. The number of patients who did not have B-symptoms at baseline and then became symptomatic during the treatment/observation period was 10% in OFA arm and 27% in the obs arm. Additional expert consultation The SAG-Oncology was consulted in April 2016 on the following questions: · Please discuss the rationale and potential added value of a maintenance treatment regimen like the currently proposed regimen with ofatumumab compared to 'watchful waiting' in patients with CLL in the present treatment landscape. The SAG considered unanimously that there are major concerns about the rationale and potential added value of the proposed extra line of ('maintenance') treatment regimen for ofatumumab. Theoretically, a rationale for maintenance therapy with the aim of shifting MRD-positive responses to MRD-negative responses and delaying progression instead of watchful waiting might be justifiable in patients at high risk of symptomatic progression or death or for a treatment with a very good safety profile. However, the population in the PROLONG trial appeared to include primarily good prognosis patients as shown in the long duration of survival in both treatment groups. In a good prognosis population without symptomatic disease, the toxicity profile of ofatumumab, in particular grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and infections, is of concern. Whether a subgroup of patients at high risk of symptomatic progression or death exists for whom maintenance treatment with ofatumumab might be a useful option has not been established. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Concerning the added value of maintenance treatment, only an effect on PFS has been observed. However, the clinical relevance of this effect is doubtful because progression is often asymptomatic and can be managed with acceptable (including recently approved) treatment options that are fairly well tolerated. Thus, treatment-free periods associated with watchful waiting and avoiding severe and lifethreatening toxicity are considered more clinically important rather than delaying progression. In the absence of an effect on OS or HRQoL, the maintenance regimen proposed cannot be considered to be clinically justified. This is in line with EMA scientific advice that had recommended OS as the primary endpoint for the study.

Given the heterogeneity of CLL, it may be of interest to characterise the prognosis of the studied population, including molecular characterisation at study entry, response to previous therapy and response duration and explore the effect of ofatumumab in higher risk patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Does the improvement in PFS of approximately 16 months in CLL maintenance setting indicate clinical benefit, when seen in light of the results of the analyses of OS and HRQoL?

The difference in PFS is highly statistically significant but its clinical significance is questionable (see answer to question no. 1). The available analyses do not allow establishing a group of patients for whom delaying progression with maintenance treatment with ofatumumab is a clinical benefit compared to watchful waiting. There was no effect on OS and the differences observed in terms of HRQoL cannot be considered clinically significant.

Following assessment of responses and definition of a population at high risk of relapse, the SAG-O was asked for a follow up consultation:

· Is the safety profile of the proposed maintenance treatment regimen acceptable for the intended patient population, also taking into account that not all patients will benefit from this regimen? The toxicity profile of ofatumumab, in particular grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and infections, is of concern in this maintenance setting (asymptomatic disease) in which watchful waiting is the standard of care. Given the long duration of survival for some patients, long-term toxicity would also need to be assessed. In the absence of a clear effect in terms of OS or quality of life, the balance of benefits and harms is negative. · Please discuss the clinical value of PFS2 and time-to-next-therapy (TTNT) in the maintenance setting for the intended patient population and the need for further data on these endpoints. In theory, PFS2 has some interest particularly in situations where data on OS are impractical to collect. Concerning the PFS2 analyses presented, depending on the different censuring rules, the effect on PFS2 varied widely (HR from 0.7 to 1). However, PFS2 in this setting is difficult to measure and interpret considering the heterogeneity of treatments used and the lack of information on prior therapies and the quality and duration of response to prior therapies as these have a significant influence on PFS2. An effect on PFS2 has not been shown conclusively. Concerning TTNT, this cannot be considered of clinical importance in view of the toxicity profile and the availability of subsequent treatments. In addition, the potential bias in determining start of next-line therapy in the observation group is difficult to assess (many patients in the observation arm started therapy before evidence of disease progression). Following advice from the SAG-O a high -risk for relapse patient population was identified as per the Prognostic factors of age; del(17p); Tp53 mutation; beta2-microglobulin level; clinical stage (Binet or Rai); IgVH mutation status in accordance with the CLL-IPI prognostic index (The International CLL-IPI working group, Lancet 2016). In this subgroup PFS was 23.2 with ofatumumab  vs 5.6 months with observation (HR=0.47, p&lt;0.0001) and the OS was 43.8 vs 34.7 months (HR=0.86, p=0.5639). Medicinal product no longer authorised

1. Is the improvement in PFS by 17.6 months (23.2 vs. 5.6) of clinical relevance in patients with CLL at high-risk of relapse based on genetic, biological and clinical criteria (CLL-IPI prognostic index). Please discuss this question in relation of:

a) the overall population taking into account the same HRs, but shorter period of time of progression in the high risk control group (5.6 months):

In terms of magnitude, the improvement in PFS for this high-risk (HR) without 17p deletion, is substantial (about 1.5 years difference in medians).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, the relevance of PFS as a clinically relevant endpoint is questioned. This is due to the indolent nature of the disease and the availability of acceptable further treatments. Thus, progression (as defined) is not expected to result in significant deterioration or symptoms or quality of life so that the clinical relevance of this endpoint is questioned.

Indeed, if CT scans are considered in the definition of progression, the magnitude of improvement is much smaller (about 4 months difference in medians). Thus, the activity of ofatumumab seems to affect predominantly circulating leukaemia cells rather than lymph nodes.

Lastly, there are no data in cytogenetic high-risk patients ( e.g p53, del 17p which respond worse to treatment).

In addition, there is a signal of delayed fatal infections (after the treatment phase) that should be considered, possibly due to prolonged immunosuppression, depletion of CD20 B cells and increased risk of fatal infections in patients receiving subsequent therapies.

b) the clinical benefit in terms of improvement in time to next therapy (TNT) or death and PFS2: It is possible that TNT reflects symptomatic progression and in fact agrees with the PFS taking into account CTScans. Again, although TNT favors the ofatumumab group, the magnitude of improvement is much smaller compared to PFS as defined in the protocol. In addition, the interpretation of this endpoint is difficult since TNT may reflect different practices, may be less objective than PFS, and may be influenced by availability of subsequent treatments. Thus, the results in terms of TNT are not sufficient to establish a clinically relevant benefit for ofatumumab. Similarly, although there are no specific concerns about the PFS2 results in terms of a possible detrimental effect of ofatumumab treatment on subsequent treatments, the PFS2 results are not sufficient to establish a clinically relevant benefit in terms of post-progression survival. c) the results of the analysis of OS in the high-risk subgroup (data not mature yet). There is no clear effect on OS and the survival. It is unlikely that longer follow-up will reveal small differences in view of subsequent treatments that can affect overall survival. Also, a theoretical risk that ofatumumab maintenance could delay subsequent effective treatments cannot be ruled out (although a dramatic effect seems unlikely based on the current data). d) the analysis of HRQoL: The differences observed in terms of HRQoL are of small magnitude and below the conventional thresholds for clinical significance. Indeed many patients that entered into the study were asymptomatic, except for the presence of B symptoms in a relatively high proportion of patients. However, B symptoms are expected to quickly disappear in patients with PR or VGPR. e) the observed difference with regard to serious and fatal infection events. In principle, the observed difference with regard to serious and fatal infection events would be acceptable if a clearly relevant clinical benefit could be established in terms of OS. However, this is not the case and therefore the observed toxicity cannot be considered acceptable. Medicinal product no longer authorised

2. Is the safety profile of the proposed maintenance treatment regimen acceptable for the identified population at high-risk of relapse?

In principle, the  observed safety profile is considered acceptable if a clearly relevant clinical benefit could be established in terms of OS. However, this is not the case and therefore the observed toxicity cannot be considered acceptable.

## Conclusion

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

'Consolidation/maintenance' is a field of active research (many trials are underway) although combination treatments may be more relevant to address patients at very high-risk of progression.

The SAG considers that there is insufficient evidence of a clinically relevant benefit for ofatumumab maintenance treatment in the proposed HR population.

The CLL-IPI scoring system was devised for treatment naïve patients and their value on previously treated patients already in PR or CR is not well established. The impact of this IPI system was on OS but not on PFS. Furthermore, the current recommendations for patients of high risk is to treat if only are symptomatic. Lastly, the number of patients included in patients with TP53 deletion or mutation, which are considered at high-risk and respond poorly to conventional treatments, is very small.

In conclusion, the concerns as already expressed in the previous SAG conclusions still apply to the HR subgroup. 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy A statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint, investigator-assessed PFS, was observed for the ofatumumab maintenance arm compared with Obs arm. However, in the setting of maintenance treatment in CLL, PFS has weaknesses as a primary endpoint and needs support from secondary endpoints. The latter could not be robustly shown in the present data. At present, no mature OS data are available, thus a clinically relevant benefit cannot be concluded. 2.6. Clinical safety Introduction The  safety  profile  of  ofatumumab  has  been  defined  based  on  2603  oncology  patients  including  1555 patients with CLL receiving OFA in clinical trials (through December 2014). The  evaluation  of  clinical  safety  in  this  application  is  based  on  data  from  the  PROLONG  study  (study OMB112517),  a  Phase  III,  open-label,  randomized,  multicentre  trial  of  ofatumumab  maintenance treatment  versus  no  further  treatment  in  subjects  with  relapsed  CLL  who  were  in  complete  or  partial response after induction therapy. Observation is the current standard of care to manage subjects with relapsed CLL who respond to induction treatment. A total of 237 subjects were exposed to OFA treatment in this pivotal study. Data were collected from 06 May 2010 (first subject enrolled) through the data cut-off date of 19 June 2014. A safety update was submitted by the MAH, with a data cut-off on 28 September 2015.

## Patient exposure

Study OMB112517 enrolled a total of 474 subjects with relapsed CLL who were in complete or partial response after induction therapy (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] within 3 months after last dose).

The  safety  population  in  study  OMB112517  included  all  randomized  subjects  based  on  the  actual treatment received (n=237 in both arms). One subject (Subject 828) was randomized to the ofatumumab maintenance arm but did not receive any study treatment; therefore, this subject was included in the Obs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

arm for all safety analyses.

The  ITT  population  included  all  subjects  who  were  randomized  in  the  study  according  to  randomized treatment group.  The ITT population was used in all summaries of subject demographics and baseline characteristics.

Subjects assigned to the ofatumumab maintenance arm received an initial infusion of 300 mg on Day 1, followed  by  an  infusion  of  1000 mg  on  Day  8.    Following  the  first  1000  mg  dose,  subjects  in  the ofatumumab maintenance arm received infusions of 1000 mg every 8 weeks for up to 2 years.  Subjects assigned to the Obs arm had observation and assessments according to the same schedule as subjects in the OFA maintenance arm, but received no protocol-required treatments. At the time of the data cut-off (19 June 2014), the median treatment duration for subjects in the OFA maintenance arm was 382 days (range: 1 day to 834 days).  Almost half (49%) of the subjects received at least 8 cycles of treatment, and 25% of the subjects received all 14 infusions (Cycle 13). The median cumulative dose of ofatumumab received by subjects in the OFA maintenance arm was 7300 mg (range: 300 mg to 13,300 mg), with the median duration of OFA infusion of 4.25 hours (range: 0.8 hours to 8.6 hours). Adverse events The majority of subjects in both arms had 1 or more AEs during the Treatment/Obs Phase (ofatumumab maintenance: 87%, Obs: 75%) A higher proportion of subjects in the ofatumumab maintenance arm had AEs that were Grade ≥3.  In the ofatumumab  maintenance arm, 62% of AEs were considered treatmentrelated and 8% of the subjects discontinued study treatment due to an AE. Medicinal product no longer authorised 0

- Liver Events Per  protocol,  liver  stopping  criteria  were  defined  in  study  OMB112517  for subjects  in  either  arm  as meeting 1 or more of the following conditions while on treatment: · ALT &gt;3 times upper limit  of  normal  (ULN),  and  bilirubin ≥ 2  times  ULN  (&gt;35%  direct  bilirubin; bilirubin fractionation required) · ALT &gt;8 times ULN · ALT ≥ 5 times ULN for more than 2 weeks. Two subjects in the ofatumumab maintenance arm had liver chemistry elevations meeting the stopping criteria.  One subject had lab elevation of ALT&gt;8 times ULN and the other subject had lab elevations of ALT &gt;3 times ULN and bilirubin ≥2 times ULN (Hy's Law). · Subject 1391 (Hy's Law): 67 years, 64 days after last dose, unrelated.  The subject had elevated liver enzymes of ALT=849 U/L, AST=742 U/L and bilirubin=64 µmol/L.  Work-up revealed gallstones and the subject subsequently underwent a cholecystectomy.  The events were noted as ongoing at the time of the data cut-off. · Subject 158 (ALT &gt;8 times ULN): 77 years, approximately 1.5 years after initiating treatment and approximately 50 days after the last dose, possibly related.  The subject had elevated liver enzymes of ALT=605 U/L (reported as SAE), AST=264 U/L, and bilirubin=20 µmol/L.  The elevated enzymes were in the setting of HBV reactivation, which was treated with lamivudine.  Diagnostic imaging tests of  the  liver  or  hepatobiliary  system  were  not  performed.    There  were  no  liver  biopsies  performed. Ofatumumab  was  discontinued.    At  the  time  of  data  cut-off,  the  event  remained  ongoing (approximately 4-months duration). Adverse Events of Special Interest Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

Specific adverse events were expected in the patients with CLL due to the disease and CLL treatments, including  anti-CD20  monoclonal  antibodies  such  as  OFA,  and  were  therefore  considered  AEs  of  special interest.  The AEs of special interest were cytopenias including autoimmune hematologic complications, infusion  reactions,  infections,  mucocutaneous  reactions,  tumour  lysis  syndrome,  cardiovascular  events, and  small  bowel/intestinal  obstruction.  Progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML)  and  HBV infection and reactivation are included as events of clinical significance.

## Cytopenias

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adverse Events Associated with Decreased Neutrophil Count

No unexpected signals regarding AEs associated with decreased neutrophil counts were detected given that this phenomenon is well described for anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies.  The proportion of subjects that had AEs associated with decreased neutrophil counts was higher in the ofatumumab maintenance arm  (28%)  than  in  the  Obs  arm (12%).  The  proportion  of  subjects  that  had  SAEs  associated  with decreased neutrophil counts was similar in both arms (ofatumumab maintenance: 5%, Obs: 3%).

Overall, a higher proportion of subjects in the ofatumumab maintenance arm had neutropenia based on laboratory  values  (worst-case  post-baseline)  compared  with  the  Obs  arm.    Median  neutrophil  counts increased after baseline in subjects in the ofatumumab maintenance arm, but to a lesser degree than values observed in subjects in the Obs arm.

## Adverse Events Associated with Decreased Haemoglobin Count

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The proportion of subjects experiencing AEs or SAEs associated with decreased haemoglobin count was similar in both arms. None of these AEs were considered to be treatment-related and none resulted in a fatal  outcome.  Furthermore,  there  were  no  significant  differences  between  arms  with  respect  to autoimmune  hematologic  complications.

Autoimmune Hematologic Complications Overall, there were 5 subjects who had autoimmune hematologic complications in this study. Of these, 1 subject in the ofatumumab maintenance arm had a Grade 3 AE of haemolytic anaemia 214 days after the last dose of ofatumumab that the investigator considered to be not treatment-related and resolved after 13 days. Table 42: Autoimmune haematologic complication AEs (Safety population) Medicinal product no longer authorised

No subjects in the ofatumumab maintenance arm had SAEs of AIHA and 2 subjects in the Obs arm had non-fatal SAEs of AIHA:

- Subject 1974: 65 years, Grade 3 AIHA 149 days after the first visit; recovered after 75 days.  The subject had received 3 previous induction treatments including chlorambucil, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Subject 1484: 58 years, Grade 3 AIHA 528 days after the first visit; recovered after 6 days.  The subject had received 3 previous induction treatments including chlorambucil, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and fludarabine.

One subject in the Obs arm withdrew from the study (discontinued treatment) due to non-serious AIHA (Subject 637).

## Infections

More  subjects  in  the  ofatumumab  arm  had  infectious  AEs  (65%)  compared  to  the  Obs  arm  (51%). Overall, 22% of subjects in the ofatumumab arm had infectious AEs considered to be treatment-related

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and 3% led to permanent discontinuation of treatment. The proportion of subjects with SAEs related to infection was similar between arms (ofatumumab: 20%, Obs: 18%). In total, 12 subjects (3%) had fatal infections (ofatumumab: 2%, Obs: 3%) but none were considered treatment-related.

The most common infectious AEs were upper respiratory tract infections and other infections. The most common infectious SAEs were lower respiratory tract infections. In the ofatumumab arm, 8 subjects had opportunistic infections while this was found in 7 subjects in the Obs arm.

Deaths The proportion of subjects that died during the study was similar in both arms (i.e. 14% in each arm) (Table 26). No subject in the OFA arm died while in the Treatment/Obs Phase compared with 3 subjects in the Obs arm. Causes of death in the Obs arm were cardiac arrest (1 subject), disease under study (1 subject), and subdural hematoma in the setting of supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) and sepsis (1 subject).

Median haemoglobin counts were similar between the arms at baseline and over the duration of study. Median values were within normal limits. Medicinal product no longer authorised C. d. e.

Median platelet counts were similar between the arms at baseline and during the duration of the study. There were no noted differences in platelet counts over time between the 2 arms.

## Biochemistry assessments

Liver function tests were assessed at baseline, over the course of therapy and in follow-up phase. The majority of subjects in both arms had similar grades of liver function tests at baseline as well as worst grades on study. Two subjects (&lt;1%) in the OFA arm had a Grade 3 for liver parameters. One subject

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

had an SAE of HBV re-activation and 1 subject had gallstones.

Subjects  in  both  arms  had  similar  baseline  serum  creatinine  levels.  There  was  no  difference  in  worst grade creatinine during the study, and none of the subjects had a worst grade of Grade 3 or 4 for renal toxicity parameters.

Subjects in both arms had similar grades of electrolytes at baseline as well as worst grades on study. Subjects in both arms had similar worst grade serum glucose while glucocorticoids were administered as a  premedication  to  only  the  OFA  arm,  steroids  for  various  indications  were  reported  as  concomitant medications for subjects in both arms.

Immunoglobulins The Ig levels for both arms were similar at baseline, which were slightly decreased but still were within the normal levels. Over the course of the study, the Ig levels increased in the Obs arm while no increase was observed in subjects in the OFA arm. Median baseline levels were below the reference range for IgM in both arms, and for IgA in the OFA arm. Median serum levels of IgA remained below the reference range for the OFA arm. Immunogenicity At baseline (Cycle 1 Week 1), 225 of 228 subjects were negative for HAHA. Overall, 221 subjects could be confirmed HAHA negative at baseline based on available OFA concentration results at data cut-off. One subject was confirmed positive at baseline (titer=32) while samples at other time points were negative At  data  cut-off,  post-OFA  HAHA  data  were  available  for  205  of  237  subjects  (86%).  Of  these  205 subjects, 185 (90%) had all negative HAHA results with at least 1 OFA plasma concentration low enough (&lt;200 μg/mL) for  the  negative  HAHA  results  to  be  considered  conclusive,  and  one  subject    who  had received  prior  OFA  treatment  was  HAHA-positive  at  the  6-month  FU  visit  (titer=16)  while  all  other samples were negative. Formation of anti-OFA antibodies was reported in &lt;1% of subjects with CLL after treatment with OFA in more than 550 subjects tested across the CLL program (treatment periods ranging from 8 weeks to 2 years). Vital signs Vital  signs  parameters  (systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure,  pulse,  temperature)  varied  for  subjects within  and  between  the  OFA  and  Obs  arms  throughout  the  study,  but  showed  no  apparent  trends  or patterns in changes from baseline. Most subjects had unchanged post-baseline vital signs at the majority of  assessments.  Adverse  events  of  hypertension  or  hypotension  were  reported  infrequently  during  the study, and the incidence of each AE was similar between arms. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Most subjects had an ECOG performance status of 0 at baseline and baseline ECOG scores were balanced between the arms. The majority of subjects had an ECOG status of 0 or 1 during the study and did not show a shift during the study.

Nearly  all  subjects  had  ECG  results  at  screening  that  were  read  as  normal  or  abnormal/not  clinically significant. Six subjects in the Obs arm (3%) had abnormal/clinically significant ECG results at screening.

Most subjects had normal liver and spleen assessments at screening and throughout the study. The low proportion of subjects who had an enlarged liver or spleen at screening declined in both arms starting

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with Cycle 2 and for the remainder of the study, including follow-up.

## AEs by age

The incidence of AEs in younger (&lt;65 years) and older (≥65 years) subjects in the OFA arm in Study OMB112517 is presented in.

Table  2. AEs Reported in at Least 10% of Subjects by Age Subgroups-Study OMB112517

| n   |
|-----|

In  the  OFA  arm,  the  female  subset  reported  a  greater  incidence  (&gt;5%  difference)  of  neutropenia, bronchitis, arthralgia, and sinusitis compared with males. Conversely, a higher proportion of males in the OFA arm reported pruritus compared with females.

a. Infusion-related reaction was reported as the verbatim term with or without associated symptoms Common AEs of upper RTI, pyrexia, and fatigue were reported more frequently in younger subjects than the older ones in the OFA arm or either age groups in the Obs arm. Neutropenia, cough, and diarrhea were reported more frequently in the OFA arm regardless of age compared with the Obs arm. In the OFA maintenance arm, the only common AE reported at a higher incidence (&gt;5% difference) in older subjects compared  with  younger  ones  was  infusion-related.  AEs  reported  more  frequently  in  younger  subjects compared with older subjects were upper RTI, pyrexia, headache, and sinusitis. AEs by gender Overall, the proportion of subjects with any AE and the types of AEs reported were similar in both men and women who were treated with ofatumumab, with the exception of AEs of neutropenia. Neutropenia AEs were reported more frequently in women (31%) than men (21%) in the OFA arm, and the incidence of neutropenia AEs in women treated with ofatumumab (31%) was approximately 5-times higher than in women in the Obs arm (6%). The incidence of neutropenia in men in the OFA arm (21%) was also higher than men in the Obs arm (12%), consistent with the overall safety population. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## AEs by race

Subjects enrolled in Study OMB112517 were predominantly White (96%), which is consistent with the typical  epidemiology  of  subjects  with  relapsed  CLL.  Consequently,  analysis  of  the  safety  profile  of ofatumumab by race subgroups was limited. No new safety issues were identified in non-White population enrolled in the study.

## AEs by body weight

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Adverse  events  in  the  OFA  arm  were  similar  between  subgroups  of  subjects  based  on  median  BW  at screening (80 kg; range: 42 to 196 kg). In the OFA arm, the incidences of any AE or SAE observed in subjects  with  BW  &lt;80  kg  were  87%  and  37%,  respectively.  These  incidences  were  similar  to  those observed in subjects with BW ≥ 80 kg (86% and 31%, respectively). Safety results for subjects in the Obs arm with BW &lt;80 kg (any AE 78%; any SAE 37%) were also consistent with those reported in both subgroups of the OFA arm.

The  proportion  of  subjects  with  any  AE  was  slightly  higher  in  subjects  in  the  OFA  arm  with  BW&lt;25th percentile or &gt;75th percentile, compared with OFA subjects with body weight ≥25th percentile and ≤75th percentile. A similar pattern was observed across weight subgroups in the OFA arm with regard to any SAE and AEs/SAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment.

AEs by extrinsic factors No  significant  differences  in  prevalence  of  AEs  were  identified  with  regards  to  prior  therapies  or  no interpretation  could  be  made  due  to  the  limited  number  of  subjects  in  some  subgroups  (considering chemoimmunotherapy, only alkylating monotherapy or other therapies). The safety profile of ofatumumab  was  similar  in  subgroups  of  subjects  based  on  the  number  of  prior  induction  therapies received. AEs in each of these subgroups were also consistent with the overall safety population. There were no important safety signals noted for subjects enrolled in the study from different geographic regions. Safety Results Across Ofatumumab Monotherapy Studies in CLL Ofatumumab monotherapy was evaluated in 6 clinical studies with completed enrolment in subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL. A total of 614 subjects from [Study OMB112517] (n=237), [Study Hx-CD20402] (n=33), [Study Hx-CD20- 406/OMB111773] (n=223), [Study GEN416/OMB111827] (n=29), [Study OMB114242] (n=78), and [Study OMB112855] (n=14) were included in the safety population. Study OMB112517 investigated ofatumumab maintenance treatment in subjects with relapsed CLL who had responded to induction therapy and were in remission (i.e. CR or PR). The remaining 5 studies (HxCD20-402,  Hx-CD20-406,  GEN416,  OMB114242,  and  OMB112855)  were  conducted  in  subjects  with active CLL disease that was heavily pre-treated and refractory. These results were not integrated due to differences  in  the  enrolment  criteria,  subject  population,  study  durations,  and  doses  of  ofatumumab administered in the individual studies. The majority of subjects had at least 1 AE during study participation regardless of ofatumumab dosing regimen. More than 50% of subjects in each study also had AEs that were Grade ≥3 in severity, with the exception of subjects in Study Hx-CD20-402. Medicinal product no longer authorised

|--------------|

There were more AEs observed in subjects that received 'only alkylating monotherapy' as the most recent prior therapy to ofatumumab, although the absolute numbers were small (ofatumumab: 14 subjects, Obs: 9 subjects). The most common AE of this population was infusion-related reactions (64%). In contrast, neutropenia was the most common AE for subjects that received chemoimmunotherapy (29%) or 'other therapy' (30%).

Note: Dose of ofatumumab administered in each study is provided in the table. a.  Includes  only  subjects  with  events  during  the  first  24  weeks  of  treatment.  Events  reported  during  ofatumumab salvage therapy were not included. Infection  AEs  were  common  in  subjects  with  CLL  across  the  ofatumumab  monotherapy  studies.  The incidence of serious and severe infections in each study was consistent with the disease status of enrolled subjects. Permanent discontinuation of study treatment due to infection AEs was infrequent. High proportion of subjects in each study had at least 1 infusion-related AEs, but most events were low grade in severity, few cases were serious and/or resulted in treatment discontinuation. Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions Drug Interactions Although limited formal drug-drug interaction data exist for ofatumumab, there are no known clinically significant interactions of ofatumumab with other medicinal products.  Ofatumumab does not have a clinically relevant effect on the PK of chlorambucil or its active metabolite, phenylacetic acid mustard.

The first marketing approval of ofatumumab was in the United States in October 2009 for treatment of CLL patients refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab.  Per  September  2014,  the  cumulative postmarketing  exposure  to  ofatumumab  was  estimated  to  be  approximately  7269  patients  (data  from IMS -Intercontinental Medical Statistics).  As  of  December  2014,  a  total  of  825  spontaneous  and  postmarketing reports from 29 countries were received by the Company. Within these reports, there were a total of 2206 AEs (serious and non-serious).

Discontinuation due to adverse events Eight  percent  of  subjects  in  the  OFA  maintenance  arm  had  AEs  leading  to  permanent  treatment discontinuation. The  AEs  that led to discontinuation of OFA  included  neutropenia  (3 subjects), hypersensitivity (2 subjects), and pneumonia (2 subjects); and all remaining AEs leading to discontinuation were reported for single subjects only. Post marketing experience Medicinal product no longer authorised

The ten most commonly reported AE's were; pyrexia (4%), infusion related reaction (3%), rash (3%), urticaria (2%), dyspnoea (2%), neutropenia (2%), chills (2%), disease progression (2%), pruritus (2%) and off-label use (3%). Seven of these AEs were descriptive of infusion reactions, a well-characterized and expected event associated with ofatumumab treatment.

Of the 825 reports from spontaneous and PMS activities in-scope for this analysis, 118 (14%) were fatal. Distribution of AEs by system organ class (SOC) for 502 reports were presented in Table below, which

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

a. These 502 adverse events were contained in the total 118 spontaneous and PMS reports with a fatal outcome which are in-scope for this evaluation as of the data lock point. Safety in the High-risk group Noting  that  in  this  study  subjects  on  active  treatment  are  compared  to  subjects  on  observation,  the safety  profile  in  this  high  risk  group  is  acceptable  and  comparable  between  arms.  Despite  a  greater incidence of overall AEs, there was a lower incidence of SAEs and a similar incidence of grade ≥ 3 AEs reported with ofatumumab. · Table -17  Overview of adverse events The incidence of deaths was similar between arms (Table 1-14); there was no death on treatment in the ofatumumab  arm.  While  there  were  more  deaths  due  to  infections  in  the  ofatumumab  arm,  these occurred well after end of treatment and are mostly confounded by post-treatment anticancer therapy. · Table -18  Overview of Deaths Medicinal product no longer authorised

In this study, 237 subjects were exposed to ofatumumab and in this application the safety experience of the subjects is compared to the current safety profile of OFA which is based on 2603 oncology patients including  1555  CLL  patients  receiving  ofatumumab  in  clinical  trials  (through  December  2014).  The number  of  patients  exposed  in  this  trial  is  regarded  sufficient  to  evaluate  the  safety  of  maintenance ofatumumab in the current study.

Infection AEs in the High risk group have a similar pattern to those reported in the overall population (Table 1-17), although the incidence of deaths due to infections was slightly higher in the ofatumumab arm vs. the observation arm; however these occurred more than 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, i.e. in the post maintenance treatment survival follow-up and were mostly confounded by next therapies, as presented in RSI 2. · Table -21  Overview of infection events 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety Medicinal product no longer authorised

Overall,  the  most  common  AEs  observed  were  neutropenia,  cough,  upper  respiratory  tract  infections, infusion reactions and pyrexia. This pattern of AEs is expected based on previous safety experience with ofatumumab. The common infusion reactions are sought alleviated by administration of steroids prior to ofatumumab infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In case of a mild or moderate ADR, the infusion should be interrupted and restarted at half of the infusion rate at the time of interruption, when the patient's condition is stable. If the infusion rate had not been increased from the starting rate of 12 ml/hour prior to interrupting due to an ADR, the infusion should be restarted  at  12  ml/hour,  the  standard  starting  infusion  rate.  The  infusion  rate  can  continue  to  be increased according to standard procedures, according to physician discretion and patient tolerance (not to exceed increasing the rate every 30 minutes).

In  case  of  a  severe  ADR,  the  infusion  should  be  interrupted  and  restarted  at  12  ml/hour,  when  the patient's  condition  is  stable.  The  infusion  rate  can  continue  to  be  increased  according  to  standard procedures,  according  to  physician  discretion  and  patient  tolerance  (not  to  exceed  increasing  the  rate every 30 minutes).

The  safety  findings  observed  in  the  ofatumumab  maintenance  treatment  population  (n=237)  in  the pivotal  study  OMB112517  were  consistent  with  the  well-established  safety  profile  of  ofatumumab, including main safety issues such as infusion reactions, neutropenia and infections. No new or unexpected safety  signals  were  detected  in  relation  to  the  maintenance  treatment,  and  most  AEs  observed  in  the study were in general manageable.

The most frequently reported SAEs were in the Infections and Infestations SOC. No cases of PML, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or tumour lysis syndrome were reported in this study. With regard to special populations, no safety signals of concern were detected in relation to Age, Gender, Race  or  Body  Weight.  The  safety  of  ofatumumab  during  Pregnancy  and  Lactation  has  not  been established. No known clinically significant interactions of ofatumumab have been detected. Overall, 40% of subjects experienced AEs  leading to dose delays or interruptions  whereas  8%  of  subjects  permanently discontinued treatment due to AEs. This is considered acceptable. When looking at the subgroup of patients defined as 'high risk', the numbers of AEs between arms are slightly  changed  compared  with  the  overall  population.  As  in  the  overall  group,  there  was  a  greater incidence of overall AEs in the ofatumumab arm. There was a lower incidence of SAEs and nearly a similar incidence  of  grade  ≥  3  AEs  reported  with  ofatumumab.  The  incidence  of  deaths  was  similar  between arms, and there was no death on treatment in the ofatumumab arm. Concerning  neutropenia,  a  higher  incidence  of  overall  AEs  of  neutropenia  was  observed  in  the ofatumumab arm, however neutropenia SAEs were slightly lower compared to the observation arm and the grade ≥ 3 neutropenia AEs were comparable. The frequencies of febrile neutropenia and neutropenic sepsis were similar between the two arms. Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  ofatumumab  in  the  present  study  is  considered  in  line  with  expectations based  on  previous  safety  experience  with  ofatumumab.  The  safety  profile  must  be  evaluated  in  the clinical context that maintenance therapy is currently not recommended for CLL. 2.6.2.

## 2.7. Risk management plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP).

The PRAC considered that the RMP version 12 (dated 15 June 2015) is acceptable. In addition, several revisions were recommended to be taken into account within the next RMP update, as outlined below. The PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur Updated Assessment Report is attached.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application was of the opinion that due to the concerns identified  with  the  proposed  new  indication,  the  update  of the  RMP  cannot  be  agreed  at this stage.  Revisions  of  the  RMP  that  may  be  warranted  due  to  availability  of  additional  data  are recommended to be taken into account within the next RMP update.

2.8. Update of the Product information As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC were proposed to be updated. 2.8.1. User consultation A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: Amendments proposed for the PL as a result of this submission are minimal and are not considered to require further consultation with target patient groups. The only change that has been made as a result of this submission is the addition of sentences specific to the maintenance indication in Section 3. How to use ARZERRA. This change would not be expected to impact readability of the PL. There are no proposed changes to any other section of the PL. 3. Benefit-Risk Balance Benefits Beneficial effects The primary endpoint was PFS. A PFS gain in favour of maintenance was shown with a median of 29.44 vs. 15.24 months (investigator-assessment) and 30.36 vs. 14.75 months (IRC assessment). Of the secondary endpoints, the median OS has not been reached in any arm. The time to next therapy (as determined from the time of randomization) was improved by ofatumumab maintenance treatment as compared to no further treatment. Data on PFS2 were scarce. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Maintenance therapy with ofatumumab is associated with a prolongation in TTNT (38.0 months vs. 29.2 months) (HR 0.68; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.90; p=0.0054) but of smaller magnitude than the increase in PFS.

Most  patients  (94%)  had  no  B-symptoms  at  baseline  and  this  continued  in  both  arms  throughout  the follow-up period, with slightly varying results at each visit. There was a trend of increased depletion in the ofatumumab arm during maintenance treatment, but numbers were scarce at the later visits.

Baseline  values  were  similar  for  both  arms  in  PRO  evaluations.  The  completion  rate  was  higher  in  the ofatumumab maintenance arm, as patients only completed questionnaires if they remained on treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Health-related quality of life assessments showed no statistical difference or clinically relevant difference between the arms at any time point. The B-symptoms Index analysis, showed a statistically significant difference in favour of ofatumumab compared with no further treatment (p=0.002) but an analysis on whether the results were clinically relevant, has not been performed.

In the high- risk subgroup the median PFS in the ofatumumab arm was 23.2 months compared with 5.5 months in the observation arm (HR 0.47 [0.31, 0.71], p-value &lt;0.0001). The sensitivity analysis of PFS by  IRC  is  supportive  of  the  primary  endpoint  (median  23.2  months  OFA  vs.  7.4  months  no  further treatment, HR 0.55 [95% CI: 0.35, 0.85]). A significantly shorter median PFS was observed when CT scans were considered, based on both investigator-assessed and IRC-assessed PFS, but with HRs ranging from 0.55 to 0.67. In the OS analysis approximately 40% of the patients in the subgroup had an event, but also in this subgroup, no differences in OS can be seen (HR 0.86 [0.51, 1.48]). The OS data are still regarded as immature.

Since the difference in median PFS (ofatumumab 29.44 mo, Obs 15.24 mo, gain 14.2 mo) was not fully translated into a subsequently longer median 'time to next anti-cancer therapy' (ofatumumab 37.98 mo, Obs 31.11 mo, gain 6.9 mo). These data seem to indicate that there is a shorter time from progression to start of next treatment in the ofatumumab arm (8.5 mo) as compared to the Obs arm (15.9 mo). This can be partly explained by different event definitions and censoring rules. The Applicant is also referring to differences in clinical practice as an important factor that explains the discrepancy in the PFS and TTNT estimates. This concerns primarily the decision on when to start next therapy.  Of notice is that a large proportion  of  the  patients  (ofatumumab  45%,  Obs  37%)  had  PD  but  did  not  start  next  therapy. Furthermore, a much larger proportion of the patients in the ofatumumab arm (31%) as compared to the Obs arm (5%) had no documented progression but started next therapy.  The question of investigator bias in this open label trial cannot be completely ruled out.

The  median  TTNToD  showed  a  prolongation  of  approximately  7  months  with  ofatumumab  treatment (median months OFA 18.8 vs. 11.5 Obs, HR 0.54 [0.36, 0.83]). With approximately 40% events, mainly deaths, PFS2 numbers are still immature, KM medians are 43.8 and 33.2 months (HR 0.79 [95% CI: 0.47, 1.33]). Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects In the CHMP scientific advice from 2009 it was clearly stated that the PFS endpoint could not stand alone in a maintenance therapy study. Currently, no clinical treatment guideline recommends maintenance for CLL. Due to a relatively short follow-up with a median of about 20 months a potential effect on OS cannot be detected. It is recognised that OS is a difficult endpoints in a disease with a relatively indolent course occurring mainly in elderly people.  Moreover, the sample size calculation was based on the number of PFS events, and enrolment was prematurely stopped when the primary objective was met. Therefore, there is a risk that the submitted study is underpowered for the OS endpoint. There are no additional data showing that the median 16.1 months gain in PFS and median 8.8 months gain in TTNT is translated into further benefits for the patients who received maintenance treatment. The latter pertains in particular to the lack of OS data. No PFS2 data are available. When given ofatumumab as  maintenance  treatment,  this  treatment  might  no  longer  be  an  option  when  a  symptomatic  relapse arises at a later stage. This question of a potential 'loss of chance' remains unresolved due to immature data. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Clinical safety of ofatumumab maintenance treatment is primarily derived from 237 patients based on the interim analysis of the pivotal trial OMB112517. At the time of cut-off for the interim analysis 50% of the patients had received maintenance treatment for 16 months while only 25% of the subjects had received all planned cycles.

AEs  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  ofatumumab  arm  compared  to  the  Obs  arm  (87%  vs  75%, respectively). Most commonly reported AEs in both arms included neutropenia, cough, upper respiratory tract  infection  and  pyrexia,  except  from  infusion  reactions  which  were  naturally  observed  only  in  the ofatumumab arm. However, the frequencies of these AEs were in general higher in ofatumumab arm than in the Obs arm.

There are no important uncertainties in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects.

There was an imbalance in frequency of neutropenia observed in the ofatumumab arm (24%) compared to  the  Obs  arm  (10%)  which  led  to  a  higher  frequency  of  grade ≥ 3  neutropenia  (21%  vs  9%, respectively). The frequency of febrile neutropenia was lower in both arms, but still slightly higher in the ofatumumab arm (5% vs 2%). This holds true also for SAEs related to febrile neutropenia (4% vs 1%, respectively). The  imbalance  in  frequency  of  neutropenia  between  the  arms  seems  to  be  reflected  in  an  increased frequency  of  infectious  AEs  in  the  ofatumumab  arm  (65%)  compared  with  the  obs  arm  (51%).  The proportion of subjects with serious infectious AEs was however comparable between the arms. The most common infectious AEs were respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in the ofatumumab arm (64%) vs Obs arm (45%). This imbalance was driven by the upper RTIs in the ofatumumab arm (38%) than the Obs arm (24%). There was also an imbalance in the category of 'other infections' reported (ofatumumab: 39%, Obs: 25%), which included infections like influenza, cellulitis, herpes zoster, herpes simplex, and urinary tract infections. During the study, patients in the active arm received more blood- and blood supportive care products (mainly G-CSFs) and anti-infective medication consistent with the higher incidence of neutropenia and infection in the ofatumumab maintenance arm. Infusion related AEs were observed with a frequency of 46% in the ofatumumab arm. Of these events, only 28% were considered treatment-related and 18% resulted in in treatment delay/interruption. Most infusion-related reactions were of mild to moderate severity and primarily occurred on the first day of Cycle 1 (25%), and then reduced to &lt;~2-10% at other cycles The frequency of grade ≥3 AEs was also higher in the ofatumumab arm than the Obs arm (51% vs 36%, respectively). However, the observed SAEs were comparable between the arms. Furthermore, the fatal AEs were less frequent in the OFA arm (3%) than the Obs arm (8%). Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

Since  no  new  safety  signals  have  been  detected  and  the  adverse  event  profile  is  well-known  for ofatumumab  as  for  other  anti-CD20  antibodies,  the  safety  of  ofatumumab  should  be  viewed  in  the context that patients with CLL currently do not receive maintenance therapy.

The improvement in the primary endpoint, investigator-assessed PFS for the ofatumumab maintenance not  being  supported  by  robust  OS  data  cannot  be  considered  sufficient  to  outweigh  the  risk  of  the additional safety burden of Arzerra in the context of the indication as maintenance treatment for adult patients with CLL at high risk of relapse who are in complete or partial response after at least two lines of induction therapy.

Benefit-Risk Balance Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects A PFS gain of 14-15 months could be viewed as a favourable outcome in most cancer studies, however for a new treatment concept in maintenance therapy the evidence should be compelling, meaning that PFS needs to be supported by other outcome measures for efficacy, preferably OS. Even if the safety of ofatumumab is well-known, the risk of neutropenic complications and other known anti-CD20 effects is increased and this burden must be taken into the context of a maintenance therapy.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

'Consolidation/maintenance' is a field of active research (many trials are underway) although combination treatments may be more relevant to address patients at very high-risk of progression. Concerning the added value of maintenance treatment, only an effect on PFS has been observed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, the clinical relevance of this effect is doubtful because progression is often asymptomatic and can be managed with acceptable (including recently approved) treatment options that are fairly well tolerated. Thus, treatment-free periods associated with watchful waiting and avoiding severe and lifethreatening toxicity are considered more clinically important rather than delaying progression. In the absence of an effect on OS or HRQoL, the maintenance regimen proposed cannot be considered to be clinically justified.

In terms of magnitude, the improvement in PFS for this high-risk (HR) without 17p deletion, is substantial, however, the relevance of PFS as a clinically relevant endpoint is questioned. This is due to the indolent nature of the disease and the availability of acceptable further treatments. Thus, progression (as defined) is not expected to result in significant deterioration of symptoms or quality of life so that the clinical relevance of this endpoint is questioned. Indeed, if CT scans are considered in the definition of progression, the magnitude of improvement is much smaller (about 4 months difference in medians). Thus, the activity of ofatumumab seems to affect predominantly circulating leukaemia cells rather than lymph nodes. Lastly, there are no data in cytogenetic high-risk patients ( e.g p53, del 17p which respond worse to treatment). It is possible that TTNT reflects symptomatic progression and in fact agrees with the PFS taking into account CTScans. Therefore, the magnitude of improvement is much smaller compared to PFS as defined in the protocol. There is no clear effect on OS or time without need for therapy. It is unlikely that a longer follow-up will reveal small differences in view of subsequent treatments that can affect overall survival. Also, a theoretical risk that ofatumumab maintenance could delay subsequent effective treatments cannot be ruled out (although a dramatic effect seems unlikely based on the current data). Furthermore, apart from a clear decrease in fatigue, the differences observed in terms of HRQoL are of small magnitude and below the conventional thresholds for clinical significance. Indeed many patients that entered into the study were asymptomatic, except for the presence of B symptoms in a relatively high proportion of patients. However, B symptoms are expected to quickly disappear in patients with PR or VGPR. In principle, the observed safety profile would have been  considered acceptable if a clearly relevant clinical benefit could have been established in terms of OS. However, this is not the case in the present assessment and therefore the observed toxicity cannot be considered acceptable. Even if the safety of ofatumumab is well-known, the risk of neutropenic complications and other known anti-CD20 effects is increased and this burden must be taken into the context of a maintenance therapy, where the alternative would be treatment-free periods associated with watchful waiting.  Without a clear clinical benefit the risks may outweigh the observed benefits since the majority of the patients receiving ofatumumab maintenance sooner or later will require new therapy. Taken together, the benefit of the maintenance treatment is not considered to outweigh the risk. 4. Recommendations Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Arzerra is not similar to Imbruvica or Gazyvaro within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1.

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation not acceptable and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

therefore does not recommend, by a majority of 23 out of 30 votes, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

Grounds for refusal: -Although an improvement in PFS was observed in the pivotal trial, there is insufficient evidence to quantify the translation of that effect to other clinical outcomes, in particular OS, also PFS2. Furthermore, the impact on clinical symptoms and quality of life remains uncertain.  Therefore a clinically relevant benefit for ofatumumab maintenance treatment in the proposed population, both for the broad, initially applied indication and the subsequently applied indication in high-risk population defined by the CLL-IPI prognostic index is not considered demonstrated. -Although no new safety signals have been detected and the adverse reaction profile is wellknown - most common adverse reactions being infusion reactions, neutropenia and upper respiratory tract infections- the safety of ofatumumab is not acceptable in the context of a maintenance therapy where the alternative would be treatment-free periods associated with watchful waiting. Therefore, the benefit- risk balance of Arzerra in the proposed indication as maintenance treatment for adult patients with CLL at high risk of relapse who are in complete or partial response after at least two lines of induction therapy; is considered negative.
