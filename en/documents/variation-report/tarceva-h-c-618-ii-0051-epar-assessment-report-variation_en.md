## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Requested type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Roche Registration Limited submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 30 March 2017 an application for a variation.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                                           | Type    | Annexes affected   |

Submission of the Real World Data Reports (BIOMARQUEURS FRANCE CSR and ESCAP-2011-CPHG CSR), a literature review and a new CSR Addendum of the previously submitted pivotal study BR.21, in order to discuss the currently available evidence supporting the use of erlotinib for treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC without EGFR-activating mutations after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, as requested in a recommendation originating from variation EMEA/H/C/000618/II/0043.

The requested variation proposed no amendments to the Product Information.

## 1.2. Rationale for the proposed change

The MAH submitted this Type II variation in order to address the following recommendation originating from variation II/43:

In  light  of  the  results  from  the  IUNO  study  and  other  available  information  on  erlotinib,  it  is recommended that the MAH discuss the use of erlotinib for the treatment of patients without EGFR activating mutation status with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen.

No changes to the PI or to the RMP were initially proposed by the MAH.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

The IUNO study, which has been assessed in a previous variation, showed no benefit of early erlotinib treatment in patients with NSCLC without known EGFR activating mutations compared to placebo. In response to this IUNO study, the FDA decided to limit both the  early switch-maintenance indication and  the  second  line  treatment  indication.  In  the  EU,  the  IUNO  study  led  to  the  revision  of  the maintenance indication and the benefit/risk balance in the second-line came into question, in particular for the patients without an EGFR mutation. This question led to the recommendation which gave rise to the current submission in which the MAH discussed the currently available evidence supporting the use

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of erlotinib as second-line and further treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with WT-EGFR. This data has been provided in the first round.

With  the  responses  to  the  Request  for  Supplementary  Information  (RSI),  the  MAH  was  asked  to provide  additional  discussion  on  the  clinical  evidence  in  order  to  support  activity  of  erlotinib  (and therefore a positive benefit/risk balance of erlotinib) as second and beyond line of treatment of NSCLC patients with EGFR WT status. In the discussion the MAH was asked to include the concerns on the interpretability of the presented data, the patient population that is likely to benefit and the rationale that EGFR signalling must the able to drive tumour growth in WT EGFR NSCLC.

## Interpretability of the presented (pre-) clinical evidence

The subgroup analysis in WT EGFR patients of the BR.21 study is discussed in the initial application. However,  the  interpretability  of  the  data  is  hampered  by  the  limited  sample  size  and  the  fact  that analyses have been performed post-hoc. The applicant agrees that these data 'could be challenged in view  of  the  retrospective  nature  and  the  small  sample  size'.  However,  the  MAH  indicates  that  the presented data in the answer consistently support the conclusion of a modest but clinically relevant benefit of erlotinib in patients with WT EGFR NSCLC.

The  pre-clinical  data  presented  are  not  considered  sufficient.  In  the  presented  literature  no  clear distinction  is  made  between  EGFR  and  WT-EGFR.  At  the  time  that  the  presented  literature  was published, the activating mutations were not described yet and specific testing for these mutations was not yet common practice. Therefore, these publications do not provide the evidence specifically for WTEGFR signalling, while needed for the purpose of this PAM. Furthermore, no additional/new information was provided in the discussion on the concerns raised for the subgroup analyses of the BR.21 study performed in  NSCLC patients  with  EGFR  WT  status  and/or  with  squamous  histology.  Therefore,  the interpretability  of  the  data  on  the  efficacy  of  erlotinib  compared  to  placebo  is  still  hampered  by  the limited sample size, the fact that analyses have been performed post-hoc and the possibility for false positives.

The  presented  data  still  consist  of  a  highly  heterogeneous  group  of  publications  related  to  several studies  performed  in  different  populations,  and/or  in  different  treatment  setting  and/or  employing different  comparators.  The  interpretation  of  the  results  is  hampered  in  several  studies  due  to  the limited sample size and the fact that EGFR WT patients represented only subgroups of the population treated in the study. Overall, conflicting results are presented in the literature, ranging from studies (e.g.,  TAILOR) clearly indicating superiority of chemotherapy vs erlotinib in terms of PFS and OS in EGFR WT patients and other trials/subgroup analyses suggesting no significant difference in OS when comparing  chemotherapy  to  erlotinib  (for  the  TITAN,  DELTA  and  PROSE  trial).  To  be  noted,  a numerical trend in median PFS favouring chemotherapy was identified in all these trials.

In response to CHMP adopted RSI, the MAH provided new data by means of two case studies. Both case studies point towards an effect of erlotinib in WT-EGFR patients. However, two case studies do not provide reliable enough evidence for erlotinib to be effective over chemotherapy in the WT-EGFR NSCLC population.

In  conclusion,  the  concerns  on  the  interpretability  of  the  clinical  evidence  to  support  the  use  of erlotinib  in  WT-EGFR  NSLCLC  currently  presented  (by  e.g.  limited  samples  size,  post-hoc  analyses, heterogeneity  of  the  data,  different  mutational  tests)  persist  and  therefore  the  clinical  efficacy  of erlotinib in second- and further-line WT EGFR NSCLC remains unclear.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## The rationale that EGFR signalling is the able to drive tumour growth in WT EGFR NSCLC

It has been known for a long time that EGFR signalling is able to activate pathways related to tumour growth. Based on the presented (pre-)clinical evidence it is unclear to what extent the activity can be attributed to WT EGFR signalling specifically.

## Conclusion

The IUNO study, which has been assessed in a previous variation, showed no benefit of early erlotinib treatment in patients with NSCLC without known EGFR activating mutations. In the EU, the IUNO study led  to  the  revision  of  the  maintenance  indication  and  the  benefit/risk  balance  in  the  second-line indication after failure of prior chemotherapy came into question, in particular for the patients without an EGFR mutation.

The  benefit/risk  balance  of  erlotinib  in  the  2nd-line  and  later  treatment  of  patients  with  locally advanced or metastatic WT-EGFR NSCLC involves uncertainties for the following reasons:

First, the concerns persist on the interpretability of the currently presented clinical evidence to support erlotinib  efficacy  in  comparison  to  both  placebo  as  chemotherapy  in  WT-EGFR  NSLCLC  (e.g.  limited samples size, post-hoc analyses, heterogeneity of the data, different mutational tests).

Second, it has been known for a long time that EGFR signalling is able to activate pathways related to tumour growth, however, based on the presented (pre-)clinical evidence it is unclear to what extent the activity can be attributed to WT EGFR signalling specifically.

As a consequence, the MAH has proposed to reflect the uncertainties in relation to the 2 nd -line and beyond NSCLC indication including the following wording in section 4.1 of the SmPC:

Tarceva is also indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. In patients with tumours without EGFR activating mutations, Tarceva is indicated when other treatment options are not considered suitable.

The CHMP agrees to this revision of the indication.

## Scientific Summary for the EPAR:

Tarceva is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. In patients with tumours without EGFR activating mutations, Tarceva is indicated when other treatment options are not considered suitable.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, this application regarding the following change:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Update of section 4.1 of the SmPC in relation to the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen based on a review of relevant literature, Real World Data Reports (BIOMARQUEURS FRANCE CSR and ESCAP-2011-CPHG CSR) and a new CSR Addendum of the previously submitted relevant pivotal study BR.21, as requested by the CHMP following assessment of variation EMEA/H/C/000618/II/0043

is recommended for approval.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## 4. Scientific discussion

## 4.1. Introduction

Erlotinib was first approved in the European Union (EU) on 19 September 2005 for the treatment of patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  after  failure  of  at  least  one  prior  chemotherapy regimen.  Approval  was  based  on  the  results  of BR.21 ,  a  2:1  randomized,  double-blind,  placebocontrolled  Phase  3  study  of  erlotinib  (150  mg  daily)  for  second-  or  third  line  therapy  of  advanced NSCLC.

By 2016, the following NSCLC indications had been approved for erlotinib in the EU:

-  First-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations.
-  Switch  maintenance  treatment  in  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  with EGFR activating mutations and stable disease after first-line chemotherapy.
-  Treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen.

On 17 December 2015, CHMP granted a positive opinion (with Commission Decision in January 2016) for the modification of the maintenance indication to limit treatment to NSCLC patients with an EGFRactivating  mutation  based  on  the  data  from  the  IUNO  (BO25460)  maintenance  study  (variation EMEA/H/C/000618/II/0043).  The results of IUNO study failed to show a benefit for the maintenance treatment  of  patients  with  NSCLC  without  EGFR  activating  mutations.  Treatment  with  first  line chemotherapy + maintenance erlotinib + second line chemotherapy was not superior to treatment with first line chemotherapy + maintenance placebo + second line erlotinib with a clear lack of benefit in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) for erlotinib versus placebo in the maintenance phase.

Within  the  above  variation  EMEA/H/C/000618/II/0043,  the  Marketing  Authorization  Holder  (MAH) agreed to address and implement the following Post-authorisation measure/ Recommendation:

'In  light  of  the  results  from  the  IUNO  study  and  other  available  information  on  erlotinib,  it  is recommended  that  the  MAH  discuss  the  use  erlotinib  for  the  treatment  of  patients  without  EGFR activating mutation status with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen.'

In October 2016, the MAH met with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Rapporteurs to present the  company position on the use of erlotinib for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

metastatic NSCLC without EGFR-activating mutations after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen,  and  to  discuss  the  most  appropriate  procedure  to  fully  address  the  recommendation. Agreement was reached to submit a Type II variation.

Therefore,  the  purpose  of  this  Type  II  variation  is  to  discuss  the  currently  available  evidence supporting the use of erlotinib for  treatment of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC without EGFR-activating mutations after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen.

## 4.1.1. Rationale for inhibition of EGFR by Erlotinib

## 4.1.1.1. Differential  inhibitory  activity  of  erlotinib  for  mutant  EGFR  and  Wilde-Type  (WT) EGFR

Erlotinib  acts  via  direct,  selective  (only  the  EGFR  tyrosine  kinase)  and  reversible  inhibition  of  the human EGFR tyrosine kinase. While differential sensitivity for WT EGFR and mutant EGFR is observed for  erlotinib,  clear  activity  has  been  shown  in  pre-clinical  studies  in  both  settings.  However,  kinetic assays revealed that both mutants exhibit a higher binding constant for ATP, relative to the WT EGFR. The Inhibitory constant for WT EGFR was 17.5 nmol/L, while it was 6.3 nmol/L for the L858R mutation and  3.3  nmol/L  for  the  del(746-750)  in  exon  19.  This  greater  sensitivity  of  mutant  EGFR  was confirmed in both an in vitro cell line model as an in vivo mouse model.

Carey et al. indeed showed that erlotinib is capable of inhibiting WT EGFR in non-clinical models. The inhibitory constant is much lower in the mutants indicating that more erlotinib is required to inhibit WT EGFR (confirmed in the in vitro and in vivo studies). For example, in mice WT EGFR tumours react with 150 mg/kg/d (max tolerated dose), while mutant EGFR tumours react on 12 mg/kg/d or 50 mg/kg/d.

Erlotinib is a relatively selective reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. From a mechanistic point of view  activity  of  the  drug  is  expected  in  situations  where  prolonged  activation  of  the  EGFR  receptor triggers tumour oncogenic activity through proliferation, invasion and metastasis, as it is the case of NSCLC  patients  harbouring  EGFR  activating  mutations.  In  EGFR  WT  tumours,  where  there  is  no constitutive activation of the EGFR signalling, activity of erlotinib is different from a theoretical point of view.

The rationale supporting activity  of  Erlotinib  in  EGFR  WT  tumours  is  that  EGFR  signalling  is  able  to drive tumour growth in the WT EGFR NSCLC. However, based on the presented (pre-)clinical evidence it is unclear to what extent the activity can be attributed to WT EGFR signalling specifically.

Although both first-generation TKIs erlotinib and gefitinib target EGFR, only erlotinib has been shown to  be  effective  in  patients  with  WT  EGFR  tumours.  There  are  a  number  of  reasons  to  explain  this difference:

1. Gefitinib reaches much lower plasm expression levels than erlotinib after administration (while higher dose is required to inhibit WT EGFR).
2. The metabolite of erlotinib retains most of its activity, while the metabolite of gefitinib does not.
3. Erlotinib might inhibit the IPP complex and consequent EMT, while gefitinib does not. Explanation:  A  proteomics  study  revealed  binding  of  erlotinib  to  the  integrin-linked  kinase (ILK), α-parvin and PINCH complex (IPP complex). This complex is involved in the epithelial-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the process by which epithelial cells lose adhesion molecules and acquire a mesenchymal phenotype allowing them to migrate into the stroma and become invasive. Erlotinib sensitivity has been correlated with EMT status (both in vitro and in vivo) and  erlotinib  has  been  shown  to  reverse  the  EMT  phenotype  in  inflammatory  breast  cancer cells.

## CHMP comment:

Though interesting from a scientific point of view, no (non-)clinical data are presented to justify the idea of Erlotinib inhibiting the IPP complex and EMT. The MAH should discuss the available clinical data to confirm the hypothesis of Erlotinib inhibiting the IPP complex.

## 4.1.1.2. Differential sensitivity of Erlotinib for chemo-resistant and chemo-sensitive tumours

Preclinical  studies  suggest  that  possibility  that  there  are  differences  in  the  characteristic  of  tumours that  have  responded  or  stabilized  following  first  line  chemotherapy  compared  with  those  that  are refractory  to  or  have  relapsed  on  first-line  therapy.  Results  showed  that  in  some  of  the  chemoresistant tumour cell lines acquired resistance to cytotoxic agents was associated with an increased EGFR expression and increased sensitivity to erlotinib compared with the respective parental tumour cell line. This increased EGFR expression and sensitivity might have clinical consequences in that EGFR TKIs may be more effective in patients with certain types of chemo-refractory tumours than in patients with the corresponding chemo-naïve tumours.

Taking these findings into account, it is plausible that patients who have disease control or response to first-line chemotherapy and who are treated with erlotinib (maintenance indication, IUNO study) may not  have  an  incremental  benefit  to  such  a  treatment  switch  while  patients  who  are  treated  with erlotinib after failure of first-line chemotherapy and progression of disease (second-line, BR.21 study) could have different tumour characters and consequently a different response to erlotinib. Therefore, the maintenance phase efficacy results of the IUNO (BO25460) study should not be extrapolated to the second-line treatment setting

In the IUNO study, patients who had progressive disease during the maintenance phase were treated in the second line with erlotinib or chemotherapy. Interpretation of these treatments is challenging as this part of the study was not randomized and the study was not designed to assess the impact on OS of chemotherapy versus erlotinib as second line treatment. However, if erlotinib was not efficacious in the second line setting, one may have expected to see an trend for improved OS in the arm containing second line chemotherapy. This is not evident with median OS values of 9.46 months in the secondline erlotinib and 9.72 months in the arm containing second line chemotherapy.

## CHMP comment:

It  is  hypothesized  by  the  MAH  that  the  difference  between  chemo-sensitive  and  chemo-resistant  is mainly based on the EGFR expression (which is higher in resistant cells). The IUNO study only included patients with 'high' EGFR expression levels (&gt;10% of the tumour cells showing membrane staining with IHC). Despite this inclusion criterium, the early switch maintenance therapy with erlotinib did not result  in  a  better  efficacy  than  with  placebo.  Therefore,  'high'  EGFR  expression  due  to  chemoresistance  cannot  be  the  only  reason  for  Erlotinib  showing  a  benefit  in  second-  and  further-line treatment in EGFR WT NSCLC. The MAH should comment on this observed discrepancy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH suggests that no big difference can be detected between the OS of the second-line erlotinib and  the  second-line  chemo  in  the  IUNO  study.  This  OS  is  calculated  with  the  starting  point  at randomization (Figure 1: red arrows). The MAH is requested to provide the PFS and OS with a starting point  at  first  time  PD  (Figure  1:  blue  arrows),  to  remove  the  potential  effect  of  the  maintenance treatment period (PFS2 and OS2).

## 4.2. Clinical Efficacy aspects

## 4.2.1. Subgroup analyses in NSCLC patients with EGFRwt tumours

Retrospective testing for EGFR mutations on tissue samples from this study was performed by the MAH in  2008.  After  histologic  evaluation,  tumour  samples  from  233/328  patients  with  available  samples (32% of the enrolled population) were considered to be adequate for EGFR mutation analyses. Two assays capable of detecting EGFR mutations in DNA samples containing 5% to 10% tumour were used. An  allele  specific  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  test  -  the  Amplified  Refractory  Mutation  System [Whitcombe  et  al.  1999]  -  was  performed  using  the  ScorpionsIM  Kit  (DxS,  Manchester,  United Kingdom) for detection of exon 19 (E746\\_A750del) deletions and exon 21 (L858R) mutations. This test uses multiple sets of allele specific primers, each of which is labeled with fluorescent dye specific to each  target  allele.  PCR  amplification  yields  different  levels  of  fluorescence  in  wavelengths  that correspond  to  the  relative  concentration  of  target  alleles  in  the  sample  DNA.  The  test  was  a commercially  available  Laboratory  Developed  Test  (LDT)  which  was  subsequently  marketed  as  the therascreen  EGFR PCR Kit following acquisition of DxS Ltd. by Qiagen in 2009. The limit of detection claimed by the manufacturer at the time was 1% mutant DNA in a background of wild-type DNA. An updated version of the test is currently marketed as the therascreen  EGFR RGQ PCR Kit using the same methods for detection of EGFR mutations as the original test. The limits of detection for this test for  the  different  EGFR  mutations  range  from  0.5%  to  7.0%  [therascreen  EGFR  RGQ  PCR  Kit Handbook]. The clinically validated cobas  EGFR Mutation Test v1 is based on similar technology and can reliably detect mutant EGFR down to ~5% sensitivity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The second, confirmatory  analysis  of  EGFR  mutations  in  tumor  samples  from  patients  in  the  BR.21 study was performed using an orthogonal method that differentiates fluorescent PCR fragments on the basis of size by capillary electrophoresis for exon 19 deletions [Pan et al. 2005]. For exon 21 mutations (L858R), a PCR based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was used, which takes advantage of the fact that the mutation of T&gt;G at base 2573 of the EGFR cDNA creates a new restriction site for the enzyme Sau961. Thus, when the L858R mutation is present, the enzyme cleaves the PCR product whereas when the PCR product is wild-type no cleavage occurs. There is no clinically validated commercial version of this assay although the literature suggests that this assay can readily detect  the  exon  19  deletion  in  the  presence  of  6%  DNA  and  the  exon  21  L858R  mutation  in  the presence of 3% DNA [Pan et al. 2005].

## CHMP comment :

Although  both  types  of  mutational  analysis  used  by  the  MAH  are  not  clinically  validated,  they  are considered  to  be  sensitive  and  require  a  low  amount  of  tumour  DNA.  This  reduces  the  chance  of acquiring false negative results. Nevertheless, several questions remain on the analysed samples. Only 233 of 328 were considered to be adequate for EGFR mutation analysis, of which in the end 204 could be  tested  for  a  EGFR  mutation.  As  the  criteria  for  a  sample  to  be  adequate  (for  example,  EGFR expression,  tumour  DNA  content,  preservation  method?)  might  introduce  selection  bias  in  the  WTEGFR population.

- the MAH is asked to elaborate on the criteria used to categorize a sample as adequate and to indicate why for 29 samples no proper mutational analysis was obtained.

-The MAH should also present the EGFR expression level (as assessed by IHC) of patients with proper samples for mutational analysis.

Mutational  analysis  of  EGFR  was  successful  in  204/233  patients  with  adequate  tumor  samples.  Two efficacy analyses were performed by the MAH in 2008 and 2013 (using the clinical study report [CSR] data cut-off date of 30 January 2004).

In the first sponsor analysis, reported by Zhu et al. [2008], the focus was on exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R mutations. The EGFR wild-type subgroup (n = 170; 115 in the erlotinib arm and 55 in the placebo arm) was not an exclusive wild-type subgroup but consisted of patients whose tumours were EGFR wild-type and also patients whose tumours had other indeterminate variants in EGFR.

The  second,  more  conservative  analysis  conducted  by  the  MAH  focused  on  the  EGFR  wild-type subgroup  and  comprised  150  patients  (102  in  the  erlotinib  arm  and  48  in  the  placebo  arm).  The analysis excluded patients whose tumours had exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R mutations, as well  as  patients  whose  tumours  had  other  indeterminate  variants  in  EGFR.  Because  the  number  of patients  with  known  EGFR  mutation  status  was  small,  as  tissue  samples  from  less  than  half  of  the study participants were available for testing, a powered analysis with significant findings could not be expected. Nonetheless, the HRs for PFS and OS of the EGFR wild-type subgroup were similar to the full analysis set (FAS) population. The analysis showed a numerically favourable OS in the EGFR wild-type subgroup with an unadjusted HR of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.52, 1.10; p = 0.1443) in favour of erlotinib, which was similar to the magnitude in the full analysis set (unadjusted HR = 0.76 [95% CI: 0.64, 0.91]; p = 0.0018). A PFS benefit (unadjusted HR = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.81; p = 0.0013) was observed for erlotinib compared with placebo in the EGFR wild-type subgroup, which was consistent with that seen in the FAS population (unadjusted HR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.75; p&lt;0.0001) ((Table 1).  Regarding response rate, the EGFR wild-type subgroup demonstrated a higher response rate in erlotinib-treated patients  (5.9%  [95%  CI:  2.2,  12.4])  compared  with  placebo-treated  patients  (2.1%  [95%  CI:  0.1, 11.1%])  and  the  response  rate  was  consistent  with  that  observed  in  the  erlotinib  arm  of  the  FAS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(8.0% [95% CI: 5.7, 10.8%]). Thus, these data from BR.21 are supportive of the clinical benefit of erlotinib over placebo in EGFR wild-type patients in the second/further line settings.

## CHMP comment

The MAH performed two analyses on the BR.21 study. The second analysis excluded patients with exon 19 del and exon 21 L858R mutations AND other indeterminate variants. Thus, this second analysis was more conservative than the first analysis. The analysis of OS shows HR = 0.75 (p = 0.1443), which was in line with the HR for the ITT population (HR = 0.76, p = 0.0018). The HR in the EGRF mutated was 0.55 (p = 0.1217).

The MAH is asked to provide data on EGFR expression level of the samples with known EGFR mutation status, as the increased efficacy in the WT group might be related to an increased EGFR expression status. Please provide also the efficacy parameters for patients with low and high expression level in both the WT and mutant EGR subgroups. Furthermore, it should be noted that in the subgroup analysis presented in patients with EGFR WT tumours enrolled in the BR.21 study, the difference in median PFS observed between the two study arms, although statistically significant, is of very modest clinical relevance (2.2 vs 1.8 months with erlotinib and placebo, respectively).

## 4.2.2. Efficacy of erlotinib in second line treatment of NSCLC patients clinically selected for EGFR wild type (squamous NSCLC)

The reported incidence of EGFR mutations in patients with squamous cell carcinoma has been reported to be 2.7% [Forbes et al. 2008]. However, the true incidence in pure squamous NSCLC may be much lower [Rekhtman et al. 2012]. This level of EGFR mutation incidence is low enough for the National Clinical Cancer Network (NCCN) to not recommend routine EGFR testing in this population unless they have never smoked, if only a small biopsy specimen (i.e. not a surgical resection) was used to assess histology,  or  if  the  histology  is  mixed  [NCCN  Guidelines,  2017].  Consequently,  NSCLC  patients  with squamous cell histology subtype can be considered a clinically selected surrogate for the NSCLC EGFR wild-type population.

## Subgroup analysis from the BR.21 study

In the BR.21 study, patients with squamous cell histology comprised 30% (144/488) of patients in the erlotinib  treatment  arm  and  32%  (78/243)  of  patients  in  the  placebo  arm.  An  overview  of  the demographic characteristics of the squamous cell subpopulation is shown in

Table 1.  Demographics  were  generally  consistent  with  the  overall  BR.21  population,  although  as expected for a population of patients with squamous cell carcinoma, the relative percentage of male patients compared to female patients was higher than for the overall BR.21 population.

Pre-specified subgroup analyses based on the stratification factors at randomization and baseline were performed  and  reported  in  the  original  BR.21  CSR.  These  stratification  factors  (including  histology type) were examined in exploratory univariate analyses to assess the robustness of the overall survival and progression free survival results.

Results  showed  that  among  patients  with  squamous  cell  histology  (144  erlotinib;  78  placebo),  the median survival of patients who received erlotinib (5.57 months; 95% CI 4.67, 7.00) was longer than in the placebo group (3.58 months; 95% CI 3.15, 4.34) with non-overlapping confidence intervals. The HR  of  0.67  (95%  CI  0.50,  0.90)  was  similar  to  that  observed  in  both  the  ITT  analysis  for  overall survival reported in the BR.21 CSR (HR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.64, 0.91) (Section 11.4.1.1 of BR.21 CSR) and the retrospective exploratory subgroup analysis of OS in EGFR wild-type patients conducted by the MAH.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Median PFS for squamous patients receiving erlotinib was 9.86 weeks (95% CI 8.57, 15.14) compared with 7.86 weeks (95% CI 7.43, 8.14) for patients receiving placebo. The HR of 0.53 (95% CI 0.39, 0.70) was consistent both with the value observed in the ITT analysis for PFS (HR = 0.64; 95% CI 0.54, 0.75) (Section 11.4.1.6 of BR.21 CSR) and with the retrospective exploratory subgroup analysis of PFS in EGFR wild-type patients.

EGFR mutations are known to be more frequent among patients with female gender, who have never smoked,  and  with  non-squamous  histology  subtype  (Paz-Ares et al. 2010).  To  further  evaluate  the efficacy of erlotinib in a clinically selected population of patients highly likely to be EGFR wild-type, the MAH has conducted retrospective exploratory analyses of PFS and OS in the subgroup of male, smoker (or ex-smoker) patients with squamous NSCLC from the BR.21 study. In this subgroup, the incidence of EGFR-activating mutations would be expected to be even less frequent than in the overall squamous

NSCLC  population.  An  overview  of  the  demographic  characteristics  of  patients  in  this  subgroup  is shown in Table 2. Forty-four percent of patients in the erlotinib group and 47.4% of patients in the placebo  group  were  aged  65  years  and  most  patients  in  both  groups  had  an  ECOG  PS  at randomization of 1 or 2. Of note, more patients than expected in both groups whose tissue samples were retrospectively tested for EGFR-activating mutations showed a positive test result (3/29 [10.3%] erlotinib patients; 5/21 [23.8%] placebo patients).

Results  of  the  analyses  of  efficacy  in  this  subgroup  showed  that  median  overall  survival  was  5.5 months (95% CI: 4.1, 6.7) in patients treated with erlotinib and 3.4 months (95% CI: 2.9, 3.9) in patients treated with placebo. The HR in favor of erlotinib was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.92; exploratory p-value = 0.015) (Figure 2, upper panel).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With regards to progression free survival, median PFS was 2.4 months (95% CI: 2.0, 3.6) in patients treated with erlotinib and 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.6, 1.8) in patients treated with placebo with a HR in favor of erlotinib of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.62; exploratory p-value &lt; 0.001) (Figure 2, lower panel).

As  concluded  in  multiple  publications  and  NCCN  guidelines,  male  smoker  patients  with  squamous NSCLC  subtype  have  a  very  low  prevalence  of  EGFR  mutations.  Therefore  this  clinical  selected subgroup can be viewed as a surrogate for an EGFR wild-type subgroup. These results are supporting evidence that erlotinib is effective in lowering the risk of death or risk of progression among EGFR wildtype patients when compared with best supportive care.

## CHMP comment

It was mentioned that a higher mutational rate was found in the BR.21 patients with squamous NSCLC as expected (16% vs 2.7%). Also the PEPiTA and the LUX-lung 8 study show higher mutation rates, 8% and 6%, respectively. The applicant is requested to provide an explanation of why this confirmed mutational testing was so much higher than expected for the BR.21 study and on how this high mutation rate affects the credibility of this subgroup analysis in respect to the efficacy of erlotinib in WT EGFR tumours.

In squamous cell lung cancers, high EGFR gene copy-number and protein overexpression are observed more frequently than in adenocarcinoma (82% versus 44%). Therefore, the increased efficacy in the squamous subgroup might be related to an increased EGFR expression level. The MAH is asked to provide EGFR expression data of the samples in this subgroup as well as efficacy results (PFS and OS) for patients with low and high expression level in the squamous NSCLC subgroups.

The MAH states that pre-clinical data suggest that the role of erlotinib might differ between maintenance and second-line treatment and this might be due to differential EGFR expression in chemotherapy-sensitive and a chemotherapy-resistant cells. The MAH is asked to perform subgroup analyses in the BR.21 study that could support this hypothesis. For instance, an efficacy (PFS and OS) analysis in patients that achieved a response or disease stabilization during the previous chemotherapy vs. patients progressing during previous chemotherapy.

## The PEPiTA study

The PEPiTA (Patient EPIdermoïde Tarceva) study was a French multicenter, prospective, observational cohort, single-arm study in patients  18 years old with stage IIIB/IV squamous NSCLC who had failed first-line platinum based chemotherapy and had been prescribed erlotinib (150 mg/day) as second-line monotherapy [Monnet et al. 2016]. Patients were followed up for 12 months with clinic visits every 3 months and the primary objective was to determine PFS (based on RECIST 1.1 criteria) during the 12 month  follow-up  period.  Secondary  objectives  included  OS  during  the  12-month  period,  and  to describe characteristics of erlotinib-treated patients, erlotinib treatment modalities, quality of life (QoL) evolution (FACT-L questionnaire) and erlotinib safety profile.

Characteristics of patients, erlotinib treatment modalities, progression of locally-advanced or metastatic disease, QoL data and safety data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. PFS and OS were  analyzed  using  Kaplan-Meier  methodology  and  prognostic  factors  for  PFS  analyzed  with univariate and multivariate analysis using a Cox model.

A total of  152 patients  were  enrolled  with  146  patients  included  in  the  efficacy  population.  Patients were mostly male (90%) with a mean age (  standard deviation) of 67.7  8.6 years. The majority of patients  were  ex-smokers  (64%)  with  29%  being  smokers  and  8%  non-smokers.  All  patients  had squamous (97%) or predominantly squamous (3%) NSCLC with disease stage IIIB (21%) or stage IV (79%). At enrolment, patients generally exhibited a poor ECOG PS (37% were Grade  2). Of 41/144 patients  screened  for  EGFR  mutations,  3 patients  (7%)  were  positive.  Overall,  mean  (  standard deviation) erlotinib treatment duration was 3.7  3 months and treatment compliance was 99%.

Median PFS was 3 months (95% CI: 2.7, 3.5 months) and median OS was 5.8 months (95% CI: 4.7, 7.1 months) (see

## Figure 3).

The  results  of  this  study  with  respect  to  PFS  and  OS  are  similar  to  those  for  BR.21,  showing  a consistent  treatment  benefit  for  erlotinib  among  male  smoker  NSCLC  patients  with  squamous  cell histology, a clinically selected population of EGFR wild-type patients.

## CHMP comment

The PEPiTA study is a propective observational single-arm study in patients with squamous NSCLC who had failed first-line therapy. These patients were subsequently treated with erlotinib. Only 8% were non-smokers. The MAH argues that observed median OS and PFS are in line with the findings in BR.21. Median OS was 5.8 months and median PFS was 3 months in the PEPiTA study. This is not endorsed. Median OS was 8.1 months in the EGFRwt subpopulation in BR.21.

The PEPiTa study is an observational study, and thus not controlled. Therefore, it is difficult to draw any solid conclusions.

## The LUX-Lung 8 study

LUX-Lung  8 was  an  open-label,  Phase  3,  randomized,  controlled  study  conducted  at  183  cancer centers  in  23  countries.  The  study  was  designed  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  afatinib,  a recently approved irreversible ErbB family inhibitor, with that of erlotinib in adult patients with Stage IIIB/IV  squamous  cell  carcinoma  who  had  progressed  after  at  least  4  cycles  of  standard  platinumbased first-line chemotherapy and were eligible for second-line therapy [Soria et al. 2015].

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either afatinib (40 mg/day increased to 50 mg/day after 28 days for patients without any drug-related AEs) or erlotinib (150 mg/day) with randomization stratified by ethnic origin (eastern Asian versus non-eastern Asian) to eliminate potential bias in EGFR mutation  bias  across  treatment  groups.  Tumor  assessments  were  performed  by  computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline and then at weeks 8, 12, 16 and every 8 weeks thereafter until confirmed progression or withdrawal for another reason. The primary endpoint was PFS (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] v1.1) and the key secondary endpoint was OS. Other secondary endpoints included objective response rate, disease control  rate,  tumor  shrinkage  and  patient-reported  outcomes  (EORTC  QLQ-C30  and  QLQ-LC13 questionnaires), although this latter endpoint was not reported.

The log-rank test (stratified by ethnic origin) was used to compare survival in the afatinib and erlotinib groups with a two-sided  of 0.05. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the HRs and corresponding  95%  CIs  for  survival;  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  and  95%  CIs  were  calculated  with Greenwood's standard error estimate. Logistic regression models, also stratified by ethnic origin, were used to compare overall response rate and disease control rate between groups.

A  total  of  795  patients  were  enrolled;  398  patients  randomized  to  afatinib  and  397 patients randomized to erlotinib. Baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between the treatment groups. Median age was 64 years in the erlotinib group and 65 years in the afatinib group. More than 80% of patients in each group were male and the majority of patients in each group were ex-smokers (71% and 71%, respectively) with 21% and 18%, respectively being current smokers.

The primary analysis of PFS was performed with a median follow-up of 6.7 months (interquartile range [IQR] 3.1-10.2 months) at which time statistical significance was only just met showing a PFS benefit for afatinib over erlotinib (HR = 0.82 [95% CI: 0.68, 1.00]; p = 0.0427). Median PFS was 2.4 months (95% CI: 1.9, 2.9) in the afatinib group versus 1.9 months (95% CI: 1.9, 2.2) in the erlotinib group (Figure 4, upper panel).

At the time of the primary analysis for OS (median follow-up of 18.4 months (IQR 13.8-22.4 months), afatinib showed a modest improvement in survival versus erlotinib (HR = 0.81 [95% CI: 0.69, 0.95]; p

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

= 0.0077) with a median OS of 7.9 months (95% CI: 7.2, 8.7 months) in the afatinib group and a median OS of 6.8 months (95% CI: 5.9, 7.8 months) in the erlotinib group (Figure 4, lower panel).

The results of this study demonstrate that while afatinib appears to show a modest improvement over erlotinib  with  respect  to  PFS  and  OS  in  patients  with  squamous  NSCLC,  a  treatment  effect  in  the erlotinib  control  arm  is  still  observed  which  is  consistent  with  that  seen  for  the  BR.21  subgroup analysis of male, smoker patients with squamous histology.

## CHMP comment

The lack of a control containing placebo in the above LUX-lung 8 study does not allow to draw any conclusion regarding the claimed activity of erlotinib in the patients enrolled in the study. The proposed inter-study comparison with BR.21 is not considered methodologically appropriate and therefore not acceptable. A very limited median PFS reported with erlotinib (1.9 months) is observed, indicating that the great majority of patients experienced disease progression at the time of the first radiological evaluation during the study.

## Single Arm Study of Erlotinib in Second- and Further-Line Treatment of NSCLC - The TRUST study

The TRUST  study was  a  large,  international,  Phase  4,  open-label,  single-arm  study  of  erlotinib treatment in an unselected patient population (N = 6580) with histologically or cytologically confirmed, unresectable, Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC who had received at least one course of standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy  or  were  unsuitable  for  chemotherapy  [Reck  et  al.  2010].  Erlotinib  (150  mg)  was administered once daily to all patients until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death. The primary objective of the study was to provide access to erlotinib (before approval) for patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC who had failed or were unsuitable for chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Secondary objectives were to assess safety, best response, PFS, and OS. The incidence and severity of erlotinibrelated  rash  was  also  a  secondary  endpoint  for  the  study  which  was  conducted  in  a  large  patient population, with broad inclusion and exclusion criteria, across a number of countries with differences in clinical practice.

An  analysis  of  efficacy  outcomes  (PFS,  OS  and  Best  Response  per  investigator  assessment)  was performed in a subpopulation of 3224 patients from this study who received erlotinib as second-line therapy  [Heigener et  al.  2011].  The  majority  of  patients  in  this  subpopulation  had  stage  IV  NSCLC (78%) and an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 (78%). Median age was 62 years (range 19-90 years) and most patients (60%) were male. Former or current smokers comprised 68% of the population with 32% of the patients being non-smokers. The most common NSCLC histologies were adenocarcinoma (56%) or squamous-cell carcinoma (22%).

Response  data  were  available  for  all  3224  patients.  A  complete  response  (CR)  was  achieved  in  25 patients (&lt;1%), while partial response (PR) was achieved in 368 patients (14%) and stable disease (SD) in 1444 patients (54%) for an overall disease control rate of 68%.

Median PFS was 13.6 weeks (95% CI: 12.9, 14.9 weeks) (Figure 5, upper panel) and median OS was 8.6  months  (95%  CI:  8.2,  9.2  months)  (Figure 5,  lower  panel).  EGFR  mutation  analyses  were performed  for  patients  providing  tumour  specimens  (from  initial  diagnosis)  using  PCR-based  bidirectional sequencing [Heigener et al. 2010]. Within the second-line patient population, 138 patients had known EGFR mutation status and only 18 of those (13%) had EGFR mutation-positive disease, suggesting that the results of the study were not just EGFR-activating mutation dependent. This was further supported by the fact that most patients treated in the second-line developed erlotinib-related rash (~77%) and the progression-free survival and overall survival in patients experiencing rash was longer compared to those with no rash with HR=0.52 (95% CI: 0.48 - 0.57) and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.45 0.55), respectively.

The study  confirmed  the  efficacy  of  erlotinib  in  a  broad  patient  population  (those  with  and  without EGFR-activating mutations and those whose EGFR mutation status was unknown).

## CHMP comment

The TRUST study was a large phase 4, single-arm study in unselected patients, who have failed firstline therapy or who were unsuitable for chemotherapy. Of these, 3224 patients received erlotinib as second-line therapy. Only 138 patients had known EGFR mutation status and only 18 of those has EGFRmut. The median OS was 8.6 months. Thus, the MAH concludes that the study confirms the efficacy of erlotinib in a broad patient population.

There are several uncertainties/limitations of this study. First of all, the mutation status is unknown in the majority of patients. Secondly, the majority of the patients had adenocarcinoma, were EGFRmut are more likely. Thirdly, the study is not controlled and included unselected patients. Thus, the conclusions of the MAH are not endorsed. It is not possible to conclude that this study supports the findings in study BR.21.

## Studies of Erlotinib versus Chemotherapy in Second- and Further-Line Treatment of NSCLC Patients with EGFR wild-type Tumors

Although  many  randomized  controlled  trials  comparing  erlotinib  and  chemotherapy  in  second-  and further-line treatment have been conducted, only two trials have prospectively investigated the effect of Tarceva versus chemotherapy in EGFR wild-type patients [Li et al. 2014, Garassino et al. 2013].

## Phase II study of Erlotinib versus Pemetrexed in Second-Line Treatment of NSCLC

Li et al. [2014] conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label, Phase 2 study comparing erlotinib with  pemetrexed  as  second-line  therapy  in  patients  with  advanced  EGFR  wild-type  and  EGFR fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH)-positive lung adenocarcinoma. EGFR mutations were assessed by the amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS) method and patients were classified as EGFR mutation-negative  if  they  did  not  have  an  EGFR  mutation.  FISH  positivity  was  defined  as  high polysomy or gene amplification.

Patients (18-75 years) with an ECOG PS 0-2 with EGFR wild-type and EGFR FISH-positive disease who had received 1 prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive erlotinib  (150  mg/day)  or  pemetrexed  (500  mg/m 2   on  day  1  of  a  3-weekly  treatment  cycle)  until disease  progression,  unacceptable  toxicity  or  discontinuation  by  the  patient.  Randomization  was stratified by sex (female vs male), EGOG PS (0 to 1 vs 2) and smoking history (never vs ever) using a minimization method. The primary endpoint of the study was PFS with secondary endpoints including OS, overall response rate (ORR), and safety and tolerability.

The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate PFS and OS. The log-rank test was used to compare PFS and OS between the 2 treatment groups. Preplanned subgroup analysis with the Cox proportional hazards model, including sex, smoking history, ECOG performance status, and best response to the prior chemotherapy, was used to estimate the HR for PFS and OS. The chi-square test or Fisher exact test was used to compare the ORRs and adverse events (AEs) between the two treatment groups.

Of the 497 patients screened, 302 were identified with EGFR wild-type disease. Of these, 123 patients who were both EGFR wild-type and EGFR-FISH positive were randomized to treatment with erlotinib (n = 61) or pemetrexed (n = 62). The treatment groups were well matched for baseline characteristics including sex, ECOG PS, disease stage and smoking history. Median age was 54 years in the erlotinib group and 55 years in the pemetrexed group. The majority of patients in each group were male (66% and  63%,  respectively)  and  most  patients  in  each  group  were  current  smokers  (64%  and  65%, respectively) with 25% and 27%, respectively being non-smokers.

Median PFS was 4.1 months (95% CI: 1.6, 6.6) in the erlotinib group and 3.9 months (95% CI: 2.7, 5.1) in the pemetrexed group and 6-months PFS rates were 45.1% and 38.8%, respectively (Figure 6, upper  panel).  The  difference  in  PFS  between  the  treatment  groups  was  not  statistically  significant (HR = 0.92 [95% CI: 0.62, 1.37]; p = 0.683).

The  median  OS  was  11.7  months  (95%  CI:  7.5,  15.9)  in  patients  treated  with  erlotinib  and  13.4 months  (95%  CI:  9.2,  17.7)  in  patients  treated  with  pemetrexed  (Figure 6,  lower  panel).  The difference  in  OS  was  not  significant  between  the  pemetrexed  and  Tarceva  treatment  groups  (HR  = 1.01 [95% CI: 0.66, 1.54]; p-value = 0.97).

PFS and OS results were consistent across all pre-planned subgroups.

Per  the  investigator's  assessment,  12/61  (19.7%)  patients  in  the  erlotinib  group  and  5/62  (8.1%) patients in the pemetrexed arm experienced an objective response. All objective responses were PRs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and  no  CR  was  reported.  In  general,  the  ORR  was  higher  among  patients  treated  with  erlotinib although the difference between treatment groups was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.062).

Post-study  treatment  was  based  on  a  decision  of  the  physicians  and  patients.  Of  the  patients  who failed second-line pemetrexed, 61% crossed over to erlotinib and 15% crossed over to docetaxel. Of the patients who failed second-line erlotinib, 48% crossed over to chemotherapy (23% pemetrexed; 25% docetaxel).

The authors concluded that in this study there were no significant differences with regards to efficacy between erlotinib and pemetrexed in the second-line setting for patients with advanced EGFR wild-type and EGFR FISH-positive lung adenocarcinoma and that both regimens appear to be effective treatment options for patients.

## CHMP comment:

The results of this study, showing no statistical significant difference between erlotinib and pemetrexed in a NSCLC population without EGFR mutation and with positive FISH, could support the hypothesis suggested by the MAH that high EGFR expression could be associated with erlotinib anti-tumour activity. A selection bias (i.e., exclusion of patients with EGFR FISH negative tumours) could explain the relatively long median OS observed in this study.

## TAILOR study

The Tarceva  Italian  Lung  Optimization  Trial  (TAILOR)  trial was  a  prospective,  multicenter, randomized study comparing second-line treatment with erlotinib versus second-line treatment with docetaxel in advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR wild-type tumors who had failed first-line platinumbased chemotherapy [Garassino et al.  2013].  The  study  was  conducted  at 52  Italian  centers.  EGFR mutational  status  of  exons  19-21  was  determined  using  both  Sanger  sequencing  and  RFLP  at  two independent  laboratories  and  the  Scorpion/ARMS  technique  was  used  for  samples  with  limited material. Patients with EGFR mutations were excluded from the study.

Eligible patients were randomly assigned on a 1:1 basis to treatment with erlotinib (150 mg/day) or docetaxel (75 mg/m 2  every 21 days or 35 mg/m 2  on days 1, 8 and 15 every 28 days). Randomization was stratified by center, disease stage, type of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (pemetrexed vs vinorelbine vs gemcitabine), and ECOG PS (0-1 vs 2). The study did not permit treatment crossover after further disease progression.

The trial was initially designed to assess the different effects of docetaxel and erlotinib according to selected  biomarkers  (EGFR  amplification  and  protein  expression,  and  KRAS  mutations).  At  the  first planned interim analysis, the independent monitoring committee recommended changing the primary objective to a comparison of efficacy between the two treatment groups as the pre-planned interim efficacy analysis, in conjunction with other data, had suggested that the proposed biomarkers had no effect. Consequently, the protocol was amended, the primary objective changed and the sample size was recalculated by two independent statisticians. The revised primary endpoint following the protocol amendment was OS and secondary endpoints included PFS, response rate and QoL. Time to event data were  analyzed  by  the  Kaplan-Meier  method  and  the  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  was  used  to adjust  the  treatment  effect  for  histology,  smoking  habit,  ECOG  PS,  sex,  best  response  to  first-line chemotherapy, and KRAS mutational status. Proportional hazards assumptions for Cox models were verified through graphical plots of Schoenfeld residuals over time, by adding time-dependent variables in the model and testing their statistical significance. A further analysis was done to assess possible treatment effects by factor interactions using the  2   test for heterogeneity and described with Forest plots.

Of the 702 patients screened, 540 were genotyped. Of these, 222 patients with EGFR wild-type were randomized to receive docetaxel (n = 110) or erlotinib (n = 112). The treatment groups were well matched for baseline characteristics including sex, ECOG PS, histology and smoking history.  Median age was 66 years in the erlotinib group and 67 years in the docetaxel group. The majority of patients in each group were male (71% and 66%, respectively) and most patients in each group were current or former smokers (83% and 73%, respectively) with 17% and 27%, respectively being non-smokers.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After a median follow up of 33 months [IQR 21-33 months], 196 patients had experienced progressive disease  (PD)  and  187  patients  had  died.  Median  OS  was  8.2  months  (95%  CI  5.8,  10.9)  in  the docetaxel group and 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.5, 6.8) in the erlotinib group (Figure 7, lower panel). The unadjusted OS HR of docetaxel to erlotinib was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.51, 1.05; p = 0.1) and the adjusted OS HR was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.00; p = 0.05). Median PFS was 2.9 months (95% CI 2.4, 3.8) in the docetaxel group and 2.4 months (95% CI: 2.1, 2.6) in the erlotinib group (Figure 7, upper panel). The unadjusted PFS HR of docetaxel to erlotinib was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.94; p = 0.01) and the adjusted PFS HR was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.95; p = 0.02).

Outcomes  across  all  subgroups  were  consistent  with  the  overall  analyses  although  many  of  the differences were not statistically significant.

Fifteen  patients  (15.5%  [95%  CI:  8.9,  24.2])  in  the  docetaxel  group  had  an  objective  response  to treatment, compared with 3 patients (3.0% [95% CI: 0.6, 8.5%]) in the erlotinib group (p = 0.003) while  43  patients  (44.3%  [95%  CI:  31.4,  52.1])  in  the  docetaxel  group  achieved  disease  control versus  26  patients  (26.0%  [95%  CI:  17.7,  35.7])  in  the  erlotinib  group  (p  =  0.007).  Investigator assessments of response were confirmed by post-hoc independent review in 94.4% of cases (three in the erlotinib group and 14 in the docetaxel group).

Of  note,  tumor  samples  from  the  three  patients  in  the  erlotinib  group  who  had  responses  were  resequenced from the original biopsies in a post-hoc assessment, confirming the absence of mutations in EGFR exons 18-21.

In  contrast  to  the  results  of  the  study  by  Li  et  al.  as  well  as  other  studies  in  which  the  efficacy  of erlotinib  versus  chemotherapy  has  been  evaluated  in  the  subpopulation  of  EGFR  wild-type  patients selected  from  the  overall  enrolled  study  population,  results  of  the  TAILOR  study  suggested  that chemotherapy is more effective than erlotinib for second-line treatment in previously treated patients with  NSCLC  who  have  EGFR  wild-type  tumors.  At  the  time  of  publication,  however,  there  were substantial concerns raised regarding the study  design and conduct of the trial, suggesting that the outcome of this study should be interpreted with caution (Moro-Sibilot et al. 2014; Dafni et al. 2014)

## CHMP  comment

The TAILOR study was a randomised study investigating erlotinib vs. docetaxel in second-line setting in patients with NSCLC EGFRwt. EGFR mutation status was determined upfront, and patients with EGFRmut were excluded from the study. In total 222 patients with EGFRwt were randomised 1:1. Median OS was 8.2 months and 5.4 months in the docetaxel and erlotinib arms respectively. Thus, in contrast to BR.21 and the Li et al study, this study seems to suggest that chemotherapy is better than erlotinib in second-line in WT-EGFR patient. However, as emphasised by the MAH, there were several concerns raised in relation to the study design and the conduct of the study. The study design was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

changed at the time of the blinded interim OS results were known, lack of adjustment for multiplicity, exclusion of patients with prior exposure to taxanes (included patients may not represent truly secondline patients).

## TITAN study

TITAN (Tarceva in Treatment of Advanced NSCLC) was a multicenter, international, open-label Phase 3 study of erlotinib versus chemotherapy (single-drug docetaxel or pemetrexed) as second-line treatment for advanced NSCLC patients whose disease progressed during or immediately after firstline treatment with platinum-doublet chemotherapy.

The  study  was  performed  at  77  centers  in  24  countries.  Patients  were  randomly  assigned  1:1  to receive erlotinib (150 mg/day) or second-line chemotherapy (standard docetaxel or pemetrexed dosing schedule, at the discretion of the treating physician). Randomization was stratified by stage of disease at start of treatment (IIIb versus IV), ECOG PS (0 or 1 versus 2), smoking history (present versus past versus never) and region (North America, South America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and Africa). Treatment was continued until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression or death.

The study was halted prematurely due to slow recruitment and results reported after a median follow up of 27.9 months in the erlotinib arm and 24.8 months in the chemotherapy arm [Ciuleanu et al. 2012]. The statistical plan was modified after premature cessation of the trial and the power of the statistical analyses to detect a difference in OS between treatments was reduced to 60%, therefore some of the analyses were underpowered to detect clinically meaningful treatment effects. The primary endpoint  was  OS  and  secondary  endpoints  included  PFS  and  time  to  progression  (TTP).  QoL  was assessed  with  the  FACT-L,  version  4  questionnaire.  For  analyses  of  the  primary  and  secondary endpoints, median values and 95% CIs were estimated by Kaplan-Meier methodology; two-sided logrank tests were used to compare treatment groups. Overall response (complete or partial) rates and associated  95%  CIs  were  calculated  by  the  Pearson-Clopper  method.  Overall  response  rates  were compared by a  2 test.  Additionally,  95%  CIs  for  the  difference  were  calculated  with  the  AndersonHauck approach.

Of the 424 patients enrolled in the study, 203 were randomized to erlotinib and 221 were randomized to chemotherapy (116 to docetaxel; 105 to pemetrexed). The overall study population had a median age of 59 years (range 22-80 years) and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between the  treatment  groups.  However,  the  erlotinib  group  included  a  higher  percentage  of  males  (79% versus  72%),  patients  with  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (38%  versus  35%),  patients  with  stage  IV disease (80% versus 77%), and present smokers (56% versus 51%) than the chemotherapy group, whereas the proportion of patients who had never smoked was lower in the erlotinib group than the chemotherapy  group  (15%  versus  20%,  respectively).  Additionally,  the  chemotherapy  group  had  a higher  percentage  of  patients  with  ECOG  PS  1-2  than  the  erlotinib  group  (90%  versus  86%, respectively).  Although  tumor  sampling  was  mandatory  in  the  TITAN  study,  because  of  the  limited amount of tumor tissue,  molecular  analyses  were  prioritized  such  that  EGFR  mutational  status  was determined  in only 55%  of  patients (115/203  [57%]  erlotinib  patients  and  120/221  [54%] chemotherapy patients). Mutational analysis was determined using DNA lysates from macro-dissected or  micro-dissected  tissue  samples  with  a  minimum  tumor  cell  content  of  60%.  Exons  18-21  of  the EGFR  gene  were  amplified  by  PCR  using  nested  primers,  and  multiple  independent  products  were sequenced  on  both  strands.  Of  note,  only  a  small  number  of  patients  tested  had  confirmed  EGFR

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

activating  mutations  (7/115  [6%]  and  4/120  [3%]  in  the  erlotinib  and  chemotherapy  groups, respectively).

At the time of the primary analysis, in the overall population median OS was 5.3 months (95% CI: 4.0, 6.0) in the erlotinib group and 5.5 months (95% CI: 4.4, 7.1) in the chemotherapy group (HR = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.19; p = 0.73) (Figure 8, upper panel). Median PFS was 6.3 weeks (95% CI: 6.1, 6.9) in the erlotinib group versus 8.6 weeks (95% CI: 7.1, 12.1) in the chemotherapy group (HR = 1.19; 95%  CI:  0.97,  1.46;  p  =  0.089)  (Figure 9,  upper  panel).  Furthermore,  no  statistically  significant difference  in  the  time  to  symptom  progression  (HR  =  1.19;  95%  CI:  0.90,  1.57)  or  time  to deterioration (HR = 1.21; 95% CI 0.93, 1.59) in quality of life (FACT-L) was observed between the two treatment groups. The proportion of patients with a partial response was similar between treatment groups:  7.9%  (95%  CI:  4.6,  12.5)  in  the  erlotinib  group  and  6.3%  (95%  CI:  3.5,  10.4)  in  the chemotherapy group (p = 0.53). No complete responses were reported.

Further-line treatment following disease progression was at the discretion of the investigator and was balanced  across  the treatment  groups.  Of the patients  who  failed  second-line  chemotherapy (pemetrexed or docetaxel), 23% crossed over to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with 20% receiving erlotinib.  Of  the  patients  who  failed  second-line  erlotinib,  25%  crossed  over  to  antimetabolites  and 23% crossed over to taxanes.

A subgroup analysis of 149 patients with confirmed EGFR wild-type tumors showed that, consistent with the overall population results, there was no significant difference in the primary efficacy endpoint of OS between the erlotinib and chemotherapy treatment arms with a HR = 0.85 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.22; p = 0.37)(Figure 8, lower panel). Similarly, there was no difference in PFS between the two treatment arms (HR = 1.25; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.78; p = 0.20) (Figure 9, lower panel). There were too few patients with EGFR-activating mutations to interpret any efficacy data and draw valid conclusions.

## CHMP comment:

The TITAN study shared a first-line chemotherapy run-in phase with the phase 3 SATURN study of maintenance therapy with erlotinib. Patients with controlled disease were offered entry into SATURN and those with disease progression while receiving first-line doublet chemotherapy-representing a population with poor prognosis-were offered entry into TITAN. Once SATURN had been fully recruited, overall recruitment slowed considerably. As a result, enrolment into TITAN was halted prematurely. The power of the statistical analyses to detect a difference in OS between treatments was reduced to 60%, therefore some of the analyses were underpowered to detect clinically meaningful treatment effects.

The TITAN study is a study in patients progressing on or immediately after first-line chemotherapy. That would suggest that this is a group of patients with 'chemo-resistant' tumours (and therefore

possibly high EGFR expression as suggested by the applicant). In general, no significant difference was detected between the chemotherapy and erlotinib in the WT subgroup. However, no conclusion can be made as analyses were underpowered due to the limited sample size related to premature stop of the trial.

## DELTA study

The Docetaxel  and  Erlotinib  Lung  Cancer  Trial  (DELTA)  study was  a  multicenter,  open-label, randomized, phase 3 study conducted in 41 centres across Japan evaluating the efficacy and safety of erlotinib versus docetaxel as second- or third line therapy in unselected patients with advanced NSCLC [Kawaguchi  et  al.  2014].  Patients  20  years  of  age  with  stage  IIB/IV  NSCLC  whose  disease  had progressed following previous treatment with one or two chemotherapy regimens, including at least one  platinum  agent,  were  randomly  assigned  1:1  to  receive  erlotinib  (150  mg/day)  or  docetaxel (60 mg/m 2  every 3 weeks [Q3W]) until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by sex, performance status, histology and institution. The primary endpoint of the study was PFS and secondary endpoints included OS, tumour response, safety, and analyses of EGFR wild-type and EGFR mutant tumours.

Time to event analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and a log-rank test was used to compare treatment groups. The 95% CI of the median survival time was calculated by the method of Brookmeyer  and  Crowley.  Estimates  of  the  treatment  effect  were  expressed  as  HRs  and  two-sided 95%  CIs  from  a  Cox  regression  model  for  erlotinib  versus  docetaxel.  Mutational  analysis  was performed  by  a  commercial  laboratory  using  a  highly  sensitive  PCR-based  method  (i.e.,  the  PCRinvader method, peptide nucleic acid-locked nucleic acid PCR clamp method, or cycleave method). A prospective analysis of  PFS  and  OS  in  patients  with  EGFR  wild-type  and  EGFR mutant tumours was performed as a secondary endpoint. To assess the homogeneity of the treatment effect on PFS and OS, an interaction term of treatment and EGFR mutation status (wild-type, exon 19 deletion or L858R, or other) was evaluated in a Cox model using the likelihood ratio test.

A  total  of  301  patients  were  enrolled  and  randomized  to  treatment  with  erlotinib  (n  =  150)  or docetaxel (n = 151). The treatment groups were well matched for baseline characteristics including age, sex, PS, histology and smoking history. Median age was 68 years in the erlotinib group and 67 years  in  the  docetaxel  group.  The  majority  of  patients  in  each  group  were  male  (72%  and  71%, respectively)  and  most  patients  in  each  group  were  current/previous  smokers  (74%  and  76%, respectively) with 26% and 25%, respectively being non-smokers.

At  the  cut-off  for  the  primary  analysis,  median  PFS  for  Tarceva  versus  docetaxel  was  2.0  vs  3.2 months (HR = 1.22 [95% CI: 0.97, 1.55]) and median OS was 14.8 versus 12.2 months, respectively (HR = 0.91 [95% CI: 0.68, 1.22]).

EGFR  mutation  status  was  determined  in  255  (84.7%)  of  the  301  enrolled  patients,  including  199 patients  with  EGFR  wild-type  and  51  patients  with  EGFR  mut+ve  NSCLC.  In  the  pre-specified secondary efficacy  endpoint  analysis  of  the  subgroup  of  199 patients  with  EGFR  wild-type  tumours, (109 of whom received erlotinib and 90 who received docetaxel), there was no significant difference between the erlotinib and docetaxel groups regarding baseline characteristics (sex, age, PS, histology, stage and smoking status).

Median PFS was reported as 1.3 months (95% CI: 1.1, 2.0) in the erlotinib group and 2.9  months (95% CI: 2.1, 3.3) in the docetaxel group (HR = 1.45 [95% CI: 1.09, 1.94]; p = 0.01) (Figure 10,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

upper panel). A supportive Cox analysis with stratification factors confirmed the significant difference (adjusted HR = 1.57 [95% CI: 1.18, 2.11]; p &lt; 0.01).

However,  there  was  no  difference  in  OS  between  the  erlotinib  and  docetaxel  treatment  arms (Figure 10, lower panel). The median OS was 9.0 months (95% CI: 7.8, 14.5) in the erlotinib group and 10.1 months (95% CI: 7.3, 12.4) in the docetaxel group (HR = 0.98 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.39; p = 0.91). In terms of tumor response, 6 patients (5.6%) responded to erlotinib and 17 patients (20.0%) responded to docetaxel (p &lt; 0.01).

In this study, further-line treatment following disease progression was given at the discretion of the physician and patient, and cross-over treatment was allowed. The number of patients who received further  treatment  was  similar  in  the  two  groups  (p = 0.22).  Sixty-one  patients  (42.3%)  who  failed second-line treatment with erlotinib received docetaxel and 55 patients (37.9%) who failed second-line docetaxel received EGFR-TKIs.  Patients with EGFR wild-type tumours who were treated with docetaxel and did not receive subsequent therapy had a trend toward longer OS when compared with patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 1.79; 95% CI 0.95, 3.35; p = 0.06). However, no significant difference in OS  was  seen  between  the  erlotinib  and  docetaxel  arms  in  patients  who  received  any  subsequent treatment (HR = 0.91; 95% CI 0.63, 1.32; p = 0.62).

The  results  of  this  study  in  an  EGFR-unselected  population  showed  a  small  treatment  benefit  with respect to PFS for patients treated with docetaxel. However, there was no difference between erlotinib and docetaxel with respect to OS.

## CHMP comment

This was a study conducted in Japan evaluating the efficacy of erlotinib vs. docetaxel in the second-line setting. Analysis of PFS and OS were conducted prospectively in WT-EGFRwt and EGFRmut as secondary endpoints. The mutation status was determined in 255 patients of which 199 were WTEGFR. Median PFS was significantly longer in the docetaxel arm; 1.3 months (95% CI: 1.1, 2.0) in the erlotinib group and 2.9 months (95% CI: 2.1, 3.3) in the docetaxel group (HR = 1.45 [95% CI: 1.09, 1.94]; p = 0.01). However, median OS was 9 months in the erlotinib arm vs. 10.1 months in the docetaxel arm. This difference was not statistically significant (HR = 0.98 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.39; p = 0.91). Visual inspection of the KM curves reveal that there is no difference between the two treatment arms.

## PROSE study

The PROSE study was a biomarker-stratified, randomized Phase 3 study conducted at 14 centres in Italy in patients aged &gt; 18 years of age with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC who had progressed on or were refractory  to  one  previous  platinum-based  chemotherapy  regimen  [Gregorc  et  al.  2014a].  Patients were  randomized  1:1  to  receive  either  erlotinib  or  chemotherapy  (pemetrexed  or  docetaxel). Randomization  was  stratified  by  ECOG  PS  (0-1,  or  2),  smoking  history  (never,  former  or  current smoker), center, and masked pretreatment serum protein test classification (poor or good). Patients received  erlotinib  (150  mg/day)  or  up  to  six  cycles  of  pemetrexed  500  mg/m²  every  21  days,  or docetaxel 75 mg/m² every 21 days, according to the investigators' choice until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint was OS and secondary endpoints  included  PFS  and  objective  response  rate.  Survival  curves  were  calculated  using  KaplanMeier methodology and the difference between groups in time to event analysis was assessed with Cox proportional HRs, 95% CI, and p-values.

Of the 263 patients randomized, 129 patients received treatment with chemotherapy (docetaxel [n = 74], pemetrexed [n = 55]) and 134 patients received treatment with erlotinib. The treatment groups were balanced for clinical characteristics at baseline with the exception of histology where the erlotinib group had more patients with squamous cell carcinoma than the chemotherapy group (23% versus 12%, respectively).  Median  age  was  64  years  in  the  erlotinib  group  and  66  years  in  the  docetaxel group.  The  majority  of  patients  in  each  group  were  male  (71%  and  74%,  respectively)  and  most patients  in  each  group  were  former  or  current  smokers  (87%  and  84%  in  the  erlotinib  and chemotherapy groups, respectively) with 13% and 16%, respectively being non-smokers. A proteomic test classification of good was associated with ECOG PS 0-1 (p = 0.002) and female sex (p = 0.007).

At the time of the primary analysis after a median follow up of 32.4 months [IQR 22.3 - 44.5 months], in the overall population, median OS was 9.0 months (95% CI: 6.8, 10.9) in the chemotherapy group and 7.7 months (95% CI: 5.9, 10.4) in the erlotinib group. The unadjusted HR was 1.14 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.49; p = 0.313) and when adjusted for stratification factors was 1.22 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.59; p = 0.148). PFS was not significantly different in the two treatment groups in the unadjusted analysis (HR = 1.27; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.62; p = 0.060) but was significantly better for chemotherapy-treated patients in the adjusted analysis (HR = 1.35; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.73; p = 0.02). A significant interaction between treatment and proteomic classification was noted both unadjusted and when adjusted for stratification factors.  Patients  with  a  proteomic  test  classification  of  'poor'  had  worse  survival  on  erlotinib  than chemotherapy (HR = 1.72 [95% CI: 1.08, 2.74]; p = 0.022). There was no significant difference in OS between treatments for patients with a proteomic classification of 'good' (adjusted HR = 1.06 [95% CI: 0.77, 1.46]; p = 0.714).

Further-line treatment following disease progression was provided at the discretion of the investigator. Of  the  129 patients  in  the  chemotherapy  group,  34  (26%)  received  erlotinib  in  the  third  line,  and 65/134 patients (49%) in the erlotinib group received third-line chemotherapy.

EGFR mutation status was determined in 177 patients (67%) of whom 90 patients received chemotherapy and 87 patients received erlotinib. In a subgroup analysis performed in the 163 patients with confirmed EGFR wild-type tumors (84 chemotherapy, 79 erlotinib), median PFS was shown to be 4.3 months (95% CI: 2.3, 5.3) in the chemotherapy group and 2.2 months (95% CI: 1.9, 2.5) in the erlotinib group (Figure 11, upper panel) [Gregorc et al. 2014b].

In this subgroup, median OS was 9.0 months (95% CI: 6.2, 10.9) in the chemotherapy group and 9.3 months (95% CI: 6.3, 11.6) in the erlotinib group (Figure 11, lower panel).There was no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

significant difference between treatments in the unadjusted analysis for either OS (HR = 1.05 [95% CI: 0.75, 1.47]; p = 0.757) or PFS (HR = 1.28 [95% CI: 0.94, 1.76]; p = 0.121). Similarly, in the analysis adjusted for stratification factors, no significant difference between treatment was observed for OS (HR = 1.29; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.82; p = 0.159) or PFS (HR = 1.35; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.85; p = 0.067).

In  the  subgroup  of  NSCLC  patients  with  EGFR  wild-type  in  this  study,  chemotherapy  showed  a numerical  improvement  over  erlotinib  with  respect  to  median  PFS,  although  the  difference  was  not statistically significant. No differences were observed between erlotinib and chemotherapy with respect to OS.

## CHMP comment

This study randomised patients to erlotinib or docetaxel/pemetrexed. EGFR status was determined in 177 patients of which 163 were EGFRwt. As in the TITAN study, median PFS was shorter in the erlotinib arm, but, median OS was 9.0 months in the erlotinib arm compared to 9.3 months in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

chemotherapy arm (HR = 1.05 [95% CI: 0.75, 1.47]; p = 0.757). These results seem to show no detrimental effect of erlotinib on OS compared to chemotherapy in EGFRwt in the second-line setting.

## HORG study

The HORG (Hellenic Oncology Research Group) study was a randomized, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 superiority study comparing the effect of pemetrexed versus erlotinib in pretreated patients with  advanced  (stage  IIIB  or  IV)  NSCLC  who  had  progressed  after  first-  or  second  line  treatment [Karampeazis et al. 2013]. Patients were centrally randomized 1:1 to receive treatment with either pemetrexed  (500 mg/m 2   Q3W)  or  erlotinib  (150  mg/day)  until  disease  progression,  unacceptable toxicity  or  withdrawal  of  consent.  Crossover  between  treatment  arms  was  allowed  on  disease progression at the physician's discretion.

Randomization was stratified according to PS, disease stage, age (&lt;65 versus 65), and response to first-line treatment. The primary endpoint was time to progression and secondary endpoints included PFS, OS, ORR and safety. Probability of survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology, and differences  were  tested  using  the  log-rank  test.  Cox  regression  was  used  for  multivariate  and univariate analysis for and evaluation of the effects of covariates on TTP and OS. Mutational analysis was performed using DNA extracted from micro-dissected tissue samples. Exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene  were  amplified  by  PCR  using  nested  primers,  and  then  subjected  to  bidirectional  automatic sequencing.

Of 357 patients enrolled into the study, 332 patients received treatment with either pemetrexed (n = 166) or erlotinib (n = 166). The treatment groups were balanced for clinical characteristics at baseline. Median age was 66 years in the pemetrexed group and 65 years in the erlotinib group. The majority of patients in each group were male (83% and 81%, respectively) and most patients in each group were active/ex-smokers  (77%  and  75%,  respectively)  with  15%  and  18%,  respectively  being  never smokers.

After a median follow-up of 27.3 months in the pemetrexed group and 29.0 months in the erlotinib group, in the overall population, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of TTP (p = 0.195), objective response rate (p = 0.469) or OS (p = 0.986) between the two treatment arms.

Thirty two patients (19.2%) crossed over from pemetrexed to erlotinib, and 7 patients (4.2%) were crossed over from erlotinib to pemetrexed following disease progression.

EGFR  mutational  status  was  assessed  in  123/332  (37%)  treated  patients  (62 pemetrexed;  61 erlotinib) who had adequate tumor tissue samples available. A subgroup analysis of 112 patients with confirmed EGFR wild-type tumors showed no significant difference in the primary efficacy endpoint of TTP between the erlotinib (n = 55) and pemetrexed (n = 57) arms with a HR = 0.92 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.38); median TTP in the erlotinib group was 2.9 months (95% CI: 1.7, 4.2). Similarly, there was no difference in OS between the two treatment arms (HR = 1.19; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.84); median OS in the erlotinib group was 9.7 months (6.4, 12.9). Median TTP and OS were not reported for the pemetrexed arm.

The  authors  concluded  that  both  pemetrexed  and  erlotinib  showed  comparable  efficacy  in  this population of pre-treated patients with metastatic NSCLC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## CHMP comment:

The data presented in the publication of the HORG study are minimal (Median TTP and OS for pemetrexed not reported). This makes it difficult to draw a proper conclusion on the efficacy of erlotinib in comparison to chemotherapy in this study.

## Meta-analyses  of  Studies  of  Erlotinib  versus  Chemotherapy  in  Second-  and  Further  Line Treatment of NSCLC Patients with EGFR wild-type Tumors

Two meta-analyses have been published to compare either erlotinib or gefitinib versus chemotherapy in  second- and subsequent line therapy in EGFR wild-type patients. Zhao et al. [2014] conducted a systematic review of phase 2/3 prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials involving histologically confirmed stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients who were prospectively selected for EGFR wildtype genotype, or had EGFR wild-type status retrospectively identified and analyzed as a subgroup. Within  this  review,  a  meta-analysis  of  three  large  trials  (TITAN,  DELTA,  and  TAILOR)  comparing erlotinib with chemotherapy (docetaxel or pemetrexed) showed no difference in OS between patients treated with erlotinib and those treated with chemotherapy (HR = 1.02 [95% CI: 0.83, 1.26]) and a PFS hazard ratio in favour of chemotherapy (HR = 1.37 [95% CI: 1.20, 1.56]) (Table 3; Figure 12).

In  addition,  Vale  et  al.  [2015]  performed  a  systematic  review  of  studies  of  EGFR  TKIs  versus chemotherapy  as  second  line  therapy  after  first  line  chemotherapy  in  patients  with  EGFR  wild-type tumours  and  patients  with  tumours  harbouring  EGFR-activating  mutations.  Meta-analysis  data  from 9 trials  of  patients  with  EGFR  wild-type  (including  the  trials  evaluated  by  Zhao  et  al.  2014  and additionally V-15-32 [Maruyama et al. 2008], Li et al. [2014] and PROSE [Gregorc et al. 2014) showed no evidence of a difference between the effect of TKIs or chemotherapy on OS with a HR = 1.06 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.22). Although a PFS hazard ratio of 1.31 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.48) in favour of chemotherapy was shown, the authors did acknowledge inconsistency between the trial results, which might reflect the clinically heterogeneous nature of patients in the second line setting. The majority of trials included in the meta-analysis allowed treatment crossover upon progression. In light of this crossover, evidence suggests the sequence of chemotherapy followed by TKI or TKI followed by chemotherapy has similar survival.

TITAN, TAILOR and DELTA: EGFR TKI was erlotinib.  INTEREST: EGFR TKI was gefitinib.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  summary,  while  many  trials  have  been  conducted  to  investigate  the  effect  of  erlotinib  versus chemotherapy  both  in  NSCLC  unselected  patient  populations  and  in  EGFR  wild-type  subpopulations who have progressed following one or more courses of chemotherapy, none has shown convincing, statistically  significant  evidence  to  support  superior  efficacy  of  chemotherapy  over  erlotinib  in  the second-  and  further  line  treatment  of  NSCLC  in  EGFR  wild-type  patients.  Furthermore,  systematic reviews of recently reported Phase 2 or 3 trials in the second- and subsequent line treatment settings that either prospectively selected patients with EGFR wild-type status or retrospectively analyzed the EGFR wild-type subgroup have been published showing no statistical difference between chemotherapy and erlotinib with respect to OS, although a trend in favor of chemotherapy for PFS was seen.

## CHMP comment:

Comparing all the data from the presented studies so far and the meta-analyses included no consistent conclusion can be drawn on the treatment of WT EGFR tumours with erlotinib in second- or further-line treatment. There is a significant benefit for chemotherapy with regard to PFS shown in the TAILOR and DELTA study and a trend toward chemotherapy is seen in TITAN and PROSE studies. For OS, only the TAILOR study shows a significant benefit for chemotherapy over erlotinib (but the results of the TAILOR study have to be interpreted with caution as mentioned above). No study reports a clear beneficial effect for erlotinib over chemotherapy.

Quote from the Vale meta-analysis: 'Chemotherapy should be standard second-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC and wild-type EGFR. TKIs might be unsuitable for unselected patients. TKIs appear to benefit all patients compared with no active treatment as maintenance treatment, however, direct comparison with chemotherapy are needed.'

It should be noted that in the studies performed with erlotinib different tests for mutational analysis were used. Furthermore, tumour DNA content of the used samples is not described in these studies.

## Real World Data Analyses Demonstrating the Efficacy of Erlotinib in Second- and Furtherline Treatment of NSCLC Patients

Additional supportive evidence demonstrating the efficacy of erlotinib in second- or further line therapy in  EGFR wild-type patients in clinical practice is provided by real world data analyses of two French registry databases. Disease and treatment characteristics were also described in one German registry database. These real world data analyses have been performed by the MAH.

## ESCAP-2011-CPHG Cohort Study

## Study Design

The ESCAP-2011-CPHG is  a  prospective, national, multicenter, non-interventional cohort in France sponsored  by  the  French  College  of  Respiratory  Physicians  from  General  Hospitals  (Collège  des Pneumologues  des  Hôpitaux  Généraux,  CPHG).  The  ESCAP  cohort  was  aimed  at  monitoring  the therapeutic strategies implemented during the 2-year period following the diagnosis of primary lung cancer.    Patients  were  included  in  ESCAP-2011-CPHG  if  the  patient  was  included  in  the  KBP-2010CPHG cohort (requiring that the patient be at least 18 years of age, diagnosed between January 01 and December 31, 2010, and managed by Hôpitaux Généraux pulmonologist), managed by a center agreeing to participate in ESCAP-2011-CPHG, and provided oral consent to participate in ESCAP-2011CPHG. The ESCAP-2011-CPHG  cohort  included 3943 patients. The present analysis included patients  18 years of age with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, without EGFR mutations, who were not participating in a clinical trial, who were treated with first line platinum-based chemotherapy, and who received a second or third line therapy with erlotinib or best supportive care (BSC).

The primary objective of this database analysis was to assess in real-life conditions the overall survival of  EGFR  wild-type  patients  treated  with  second-  or  third-line  erlotinib  for  inoperable  advanced  or metastatic NSCLC.

The secondary objectives were to assess the overall survival of patients with second- or third-line best supportive care, to describe patients' characteristics according to second- or third-line therapy (with erlotinib  or  with  best  supportive  care),  and  to  search  for  predictive  factors  of  survival  of  erlotinibtreated patients.

## Results

## Study Population

Two  hundred  and  seventy  four  patients  were  analysed.  Among  these  patients,  185 patients  (68%) were treated with erlotinib [2L: n = 121 (65%); 3L: n = 64 (35%)], and 89 patients (32%) received BSC [2L: n = 62 (70%); 3L: n = 27 (30%)]. The majority of the 274 analysed patients were men (74%), less than 65 years old (60%), current or former smokers (88%), with more advanced disease (stage IV: 84%), and in good general condition (ECOG PS ≤1: 83%). This proportion of patients in a good general condition  was  higher  in  the  erlotinib  group  (89%  [95%  CI:  83,  93])  than  in  the  BSC group (72% [95% CI: 61, 81]). Disease characteristics between patients who received erlotinib and BSC patients were not significantly different.

At initial diagnosis of primary lung cancer, most patients had advanced disease stage (stage IV: 84%). Adenocarcinoma  was  the  most  frequent  histology  type  of  cancer  (89%)  and  6%  of  the  patients presented with recurrent disease, without differences between treatment groups.

## Overall  survival  in  NSCLC  patients  with  EGFR  wild-type tumours  treated  with  second-  and  third-line erlotinib

The  median  OS  (Kaplan-Meier  method)  of  patients  treated  with  erlotinib  as  second-  or  third-line therapy was 4.2 months (95% CI; 3.5, 5.4) from treatment initiation until the end of patients' followup (Figure 13). The 3, 6, and 12 month survival rates were 62% (95% CI; 56, 70), 37% (95% CI; 30, 45), and 17% (95% CI; 12, 24), respectively.

Among patients treated with second-line erlotinib only, median OS was 4.7 months (95% CI: 3.4, 6.4) and the 3, 6, and 12 month survival rates were 63% (95% CI; 55, 72), 42% (95% CI; 34, 52), and 18%  (95%  CI;  12,  27),  respectively  (Figure 14,  upper  panel).  Sensitivity  analyses  using  inverse probability  weighting  to  adjust  for  age,  gender,  smoking  status,  ECOG  PS  class,  tumor-nodemetastasis (TNM) classification and cancer stage, histology, recurrent disease, and 1L chemotherapy (platinum  salts,  3 rd   generation  chemotherapy,  derived  platinum  doublets,  reason  for  treatment discontinuation), corroborated these OS estimates.

In  patients  treated  with  third-line  erlotinib  only,  median  OS  was  3.7  months  (95%  CI;  3.1,  5.6) (Figure 14, lower panel). At 3, 6, and 12 months after the first intake of erlotinib, survival rates were 61% (95% CI; 50, 75), 27% (95% CI; 18, 41), and 15% (95% CI; 8, 28), respectively.

Overall survival in NSCLC patients with EGFR wild-type tumors treated with best supportive care

Median OS in patients receiving best supportive  care was 1.3 months (95% CI; 1, 1.8), which was estimated from 88 patients without missing data from treatment initiation until the end of follow-up (Figure 15). At 3, 6, and 12 months after the first supportive care, survival rates were 20% (95% CI; 14, 31), 8% (95% CI; 4, 17), and 3% (95% CI; 1, 12), respectively.

Among patients who received only second-line best supportive care, median OS was 1.1 months (95% CI; 0.8, 1.8), estimated from 61 patients without missing dates. The 3, 6, and 12 month survival rates were 20% (95% CI; 12, 33), 8% (95% CI; 3, 19), and 4% (95% CI; 1, 15), respectively. The results were corroborated by sensitivity analyses using inverse probability weighting to adjust for age, gender, smoking status, ECOG PS class, TNM classification and cancer stage, histology, recurrent disease, and 1L chemotherapy (platinum salts, 3 rd  generation chemotherapy, derived platinum doublets, reason for treatment discontinuation).

Median OS among the 27 patients treated with third-line best supportive care was 1.5 months (95% CI; 1.2, 2.4). The 3 and 6 month survival rates were 22% (95% CI; 11, 45) and 9% (95% CI; 3, 33), respectively.

This analysis may be subject to selection bias and confounding.  Additionally, there was a lack of EGFR status  documentation in a high proportion of patients, which may limit the generalizability  of these results to all such treated EGFRwt advanced NSCLC patients. Furthermore, the increase in median OS from 1.1 months in second line to 1.5 months in third line for the BSC group may be a result of the very limited number of patients in third-line treatment.

## Conclusions

Notwithstanding  the  limitations  stated  above,  the  findings  from  the  database  analysis  showed improved OS for erlotinib over BSC, specifically in EGFR wild-type patients in second- and third line treatment in a real-life setting.

## BIOMARQUERS FRANCE Cohort Study

## Study design

The BIOMARQUEURS  FRANCE cohort  is  a  prospective,  national  multicenter,  non-interventional registry which was designed to collect data on cancer molecular genetics in order to contribute to the improvement of management of NSCLC patients. The cohort included clinical and biological data from 17825 NSCLC patients from 28 French molecular oncogenetics platforms between November 2011 and April 2013, with a 12-month follow-up.

A  retrospective  analysis  was  implemented  to  assess,  in  real-world  conditions,  the  OS  of  a  subpopulation of the BIOMARQUEURS FRANCE cohort with EGFR wild-type and no ALK translocation, and who were treated with second-line EGFR-TKIs or chemotherapy (Note: the EGFR-TKI was considered to be erlotinib by default). Secondary objectives were to assess the OS of second-line chemotherapy (taxanes or pemetrexed)-treated patients, the PFS in erlotinib- and in chemotherapy-treated patients, to  describe  patients'  characteristics  according  to  second-line  erlotinib  or  chemotherapy,  to  describe chemotherapy  and  erlotinib  discontinuations  due  to  toxicity,  and  to  search  for  predictive  factors  of patients' survival according to treatment (erlotinib or chemotherapy).

## Results

## Study population

The  study  cohort  included  1278  patients  age  18  years  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC confirmed by histology, without EGFR mutation or ALK translocation, and having received a 2 nd  line treatment  with  chemotherapy  or  EGFR-TKI  after  a  1 st line  therapy.    The  EGFR-TKI  with  marketing authorization  reported  in  the  BIOMARQUEURS  FRANCE  cohort  was  considered  to  be  erlotinib  by default.  Among  the  1278  eligible  patients,  410  (32%)  were  treated  with  erlotinib  while  868  (68%) received  chemotherapy  in  the  second  line.  The  majority  of  analysed  patients  were  men  (68%)  and median age of the patient population was 62 years (range: 30-91). Most of the patients were current or former smokers (87%) and they were in good general condition in most cases (ECOG PS 0-1: 75%).

Compared to chemotherapy, erlotinib tended to be prescribed particularly in patients who were never smokers (17% versus 9%), with more advanced disease stage (stage IV: 90% versus 82%), older age (  65 years: 47% versus 33%) and poorer general condition (ECOG PS  1: 73% versus 82%).

Sixty-nine percent of patients had received pemetrexed as previous first-line treatment. Discontinuation of this first-line treatment was more often due to disease progression than to toxicity (in  66%  of  the  patients  versus  10%).  By  comparison  with  patients  treated  with  chemotherapy,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients  treated  with  EGFR-TKI  discontinued  first-line  treatment  due  to  toxicity  more  often  than patients having received chemotherapy (13%, CI 95%=[10; 16] versus 8%, CI 95%=[6; 10]).

## Overall survival

The median OS of patients treated with erlotinib was 5.1 months (95% CI: 4.4, 6.4) from the first disease progression after the first line treatment (

Figure 16, upper panel). At 3, 6, and 12 months, survival rates were 66% (95% CI: [61; 71]), 46% (95% CI: [41; 51]), and 28% (95% CI: [23; 34]), respectively.

In  patients  treated  with  second-line  chemotherapy, median OS was 8.0 months (95% CI: 7.3, 8.9) from first-line disease progression (16, lower panel). At 3, 6, and 12 months, survival rates were 80% (95% CI: 77, 82), 61% (95% CI: 58, 65), and 36% (95% CI: 33, 40), respectively.

Median PFS in patients treated with second-line erlotinib was 2.8 months (95% CI: 2.6, 3.2) from firstline disease progression. At 3, 6, and 12 months, PFS rates were 46% (95% CI: 41, 51), 26% (95% CI: 22, 31), and 11% (95% CI: 7, 14), respectively (Figure 17, upper panel).

The unadjusted median PFS in patients treated with second-line chemotherapy was 4.2 months (95% CI: 3.8, 4.6) (Figure 17, lower panel). The 3, 6, and 12 month PFS rates were 62% (95% CI: [58; 65]), 39% (95% CI: [35; 42]), and 22% (95% CI: [19; 25]), respectively.

These  analyses  using  patients  extracted  from  the  BIOMARQUEURS  FRANCE  database  have  several limitations  that  may  cause  bias.  For  example,  as  the  second  line  treatment  initiation  date  was  not collected  in  the  cohort,  the  date  of  the  first  line  disease  progression  was  considered  as  the  best estimate  of  the  date  of  the  initiation  of  second  line  therapy.  The  EGFR-TKI  was  considered  to  be erlotinib by default, although both gefitinib and erlotinib could have been used and gefitinib may not be as effective as a comparator against chemotherapy as erlotinib in second line therapy. In addition, patient selection bias may also have been introduced by excluding a high proportion of patients whose second  line  treatments  were  not  documented.  All  covariates  of  interest  for  the  choice  of  a  specific second  line  treatment  were  not  available  in  the  database  and  were  not  taken  into  account  for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sensitivity  analyses.  Furthermore,  only  patients  starting  a  second  line  of  treatment  (and  then experiencing disease progression) within a 12-month period after the genetic test request, could be included in the database analysis. These biases may limit the robustness and generalizability of these results to all such treated patients.

## Conclusions

Although  the  results  of  this  real-world  database  analysis  demonstrate  that  chemotherapy  shows  a slight  improvement  in  median  PFS  and  median  OS  compared  with  erlotinib,  the  analysed  patient population from the BIOMARKER FRANCE has several biases that may limit the generalizability of the study results. The OS difference is not yet clear when considering previous studies in similar patient populations.  Nonetheless,  erlotinib  remains  a  valuable  treatment  option  with  a  manageable  safety profile  in  second-  and  further  lines  of  therapy,  particularly  for  those  who  may  not  tolerate  further chemotherapy.

## German TLK Lung Cancer Tumor Registry

The German  TLK  Lung  Cancer  Tumor  Registry is  a  prospective,  national,  multicenter,  noninterventional NSCLC registry. The TLK has recruited a representative sample of approximately 1.5% of patients newly diagnosed with NSCLC in Germany each year. It presents the course of the disease and treatment practice by oncologists in private practice and hospitals in Germany. The TLK covers a study  period  of  six  years  (2010-2016),  with  a  four-year  recruitment  phase  (February  2010  to December 2014) and a two-year follow-up phase. By January 2016, 2434 patients recruited by 110 study sites from all over Germany were evaluable for analysis.

A  retrospective  analysis  of  a  subcohort  of  the  TLK  registry  was  conducted  to  understand  treatment utilization in the real world setting (Roche data on file). This analysis was based on eligible patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, age ≥18 years, without EGFR mutation, and who received a  second-  or  further  line  treatment.  In  total  527  eligible  patients  (211  EGFR  wild-type,  316  EGFRuntested) were analyzed (Table 5). Among these were 49 erlotinib users with EGFR wild-type and 69 erlotinib users with EGFR-untested status. Due to the limited sample size for erlotinib users in secondline, only disease and treatment characteristics were described. No statistically significant difference in patient and disease characteristics was observed among patients who received erlotinib, or docetaxel, or pemetrexed. Among EGFR wild-type patients, use of erlotinib was more common in third-line than second-line (17.2% versus 13.8%, respectively) while use of pemetrexed (18.3% versus 24.3%) or docetaxel (19.4% versus 30%) was less likely in third-line than second-line.

Although not directly related to treatment response, treatment utilization data observed from the TLK analysis were similar to findings from the real world studies using the two databases in France.

## CHMP comment

The  MAH  presents  additional  evidence  in  the  form  of  'real  world  data'  to  support  the  efficacy  of erlotinib in  the  second  line-setting  in  WT-  EGFR  patients.  In  the  Biomarquers France  study it is not possible to differentiate which EGFR-TKIs were used in the second-line. The MAH is assuming that it is erlotinib, however, this cannot be confirmed, and is a major drawback in this study.

The MAH also presents the results of a retrospective study conducted in Germany in WT-EGFR patients treated with +2L patients. This study showed erlotinib was more likely to be used in third-line than in second-line, while the opposite was the case for docetaxel and pemetrexed.

## 4.2.3. Discussion

In the first round, the MAH was requested to discuss the currently available evidence supporting the use of erlotinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with WT-EGFR after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. The data presented in this variation include a new retrospective efficacy analysis of erlotinib in the subgroup of WT-EGFR patients enrolled in the pivotal BR.21 study and exploratory efficacy analysis of erlotinib in a clinically selected subgroup of patients (male, smoking patients with squamous histology), who are considered unlikely to harbour EGFR activating mutations. Furthermore, data from patient registry/study cohorts (e.g., ESCAP and BIOMARQUERS) were reported to assess the efficacy of erlotinib in WT-EGFR patients in a real-life condition. Several publications  on the possible activity of  erlotinib as second- and/or further line treatment of NSCLC patients with WT-EGFR tumours were also presented.

## Mechanism of action in WT-EGFR patients

Erlotinib is a relatively selective reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. From a mechanistic point of view activity of the drug is expected in situations where prolonged activation of the EGFR receptor triggers tumor oncogenic activity through proliferation, invasion and metastasis, as it is the case of NSCLC patients harbouring EGFR activating mutations.  The rationale supporting activity of Erlotinib in EGFR WT tumours is that EGFR signalling is able to drive tumor growth in the WT EGFR NSCLC. In this round, based on the presented (pre-)clinical evidence it is unclear to what extent the activity can be attributed to WT EGFR signalling specifically.

## BR.21 study, Erlotinib vs placebo

The MAH suggest that the role of erlotinib might differ between maintenance and second-line treatment and this might be due to differential EGFR expression in chemotherapy-sensitive (low EGFR expression) and chemotherapy-resistant cells (high EGFR expression). In this round additional preclinical evidence is presented to support this hypothesis. Unfortunately, no clinical evidence is presented to support this hypothesis.

In consequence to this hypothesis, The MAH suggests that  activity of erlotinib in the EGFR WT NSCLC population could be due to high expression of WT EGFR resulting in an increased activation of the signalling cascade and subsequent tumour growth. EGFR expression level could also justify some

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

activity of erlotinib in NSCLC either squamous cell histology, as high EGFR gene copy-number and protein overexpression have been reported more frequently in tumour specimens with squamous cell compared with adenocarcinoma histology (82% versus 44%).

## Erlotinib and other approved second- and further line treatment regimens

The main publications comparing erlotinib to chemotherapy (pemetrexed and docetaxel) are also discussed in this variation. They consist of a heterogeneous group of publications related to several studies performed in different populations, and/or in different treatment setting and/or employing different comparators. Interpretation of the results is also hampered in several studies due to the limited sample size and the fact that EGFR WT patients represented only subgroups of the population treated in the studies. Similarly, the publications related to real-life databases/patient registries present important limitations as discussed above. Importantly, different tests have been used in the different studies in to evaluate EGFR status.

Overall, conflicting results are presented in the literature, ranging from studies (e.g., TAILOR) clearly indicating superiority of chemotherapy vs erlotinib in terms of PFS and OS in EGFR WT patients and other trials/subgroup analyses suggesting no significant difference in OS when comparing chemotherapy to erlotinib (for TITAN, DELTA and PROSE trial). Of note, a numerical trend in median PFS favouring chemotherapy was identified in all these trials.

In this round, the applicant provided new data by means of two case studies. Both case studies point towards an effect of erlotinib in these WT-EGFR patients, However, two case studies are not considering as outstanding and related with uncertainties.

## Conclusion

The IUNO study, which has been assessed in a previous variation, showed no benefit of early erlotinib treatment in patients with NSCLC without known EGFR activating mutations. In the EU, the IUNO study led to the revision of the maintenance indication and the benefit/risk balance in the second-line indication after failure of prior chemotherapy came into question, in particular for patients without EGFR mutation.

The benefit/risk balance of erlotinib in the 2nd-line and beyond treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic WT-EGFR NSCLC involves uncertainties for the following reasons:

First, the concerns persist on the interpretability of the currently presented clinical evidence to support erlotinib efficacy in comparison to both placebo as chemotherapy in WT-EGFR NSLCLC (e.g. limited samples size, post-hoc analyses, heterogeneity of the data, different mutational tests).

Second, it has been known for a long time that EGFR signalling is able to activate pathways related to tumour growth, however, based on the presented (pre-)clinical evidence it is unclear to what extent the activity can be attributed to WT EGFR signalling specifically.

As a consequence, the MAH has proposed to reflect the uncertainties in relation to the 2 nd -line and beyond NSCLC indication including the following wording in section 4.1 of the SmPC:

Tarceva is also indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. In patients with tumours without EGFR activating mutations, Tarceva is indicated when other treatment options are not considered suitable.

The CHMP agrees to this revision of the indication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.3. Clinical Safety aspects

Erlotinib  has  a  well-established  and  manageable  safety  profile.  Important  identified  risks  associated with  erlotinib  treatment  include  cutaneous  toxicity,  interstitial  lung  disease  (ILD),  liver  injury, gastrointestinal fluid loss, gastrointestinal perforation, ocular toxicity, interaction with potent inducers and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, interaction with medicinal products that alter pH of the upper GI tract and interaction with smoking (CYP1A2 induction).

In contrast to currently approved chemotherapeutic agents, erlotinib is not associated with myelosuppression, neuropathy, or severe emesis. The lack of classical chemotherapy toxicity, the low rate of patient withdrawal, and the ease of administration make erlotinib a favorable and well-tolerated anti-cancer treatment option.

In the BR.21 phase III pivotal study of second line treatment of advanced NSCLC, the overall incidence of  adverse events (AEs) regardless of causality was similar between the erlotinib and placebo  arms (99% vs 96%, respectively). Rash (75%, vs 17% in the placebo group) and diarrhoea (54%, vs 18% in  the  placebo group) were the most common AEs regardless of causality in the erlotinib arm. Most were Grade 1 or 2 in severity (rash: 66% vs 17%; diarrhoea: 48% vs 17%) and manageable without intervention.  Severe  rash  and  diarrhoea  occurred  in  9%  and  6%,  respectively,  in  erlotinib-treated patients and each resulted in discontinuation in 1% of patients. Dose reductions were required for 10% of patients due to rash and 4% of patients due to diarrhoea.

Other common AEs, regardless of severity, that occurred more frequently in the erlotinib group versus the placebo group included nausea (33% vs 24%), vomiting (23% vs 19%), stomatitis (17% vs 3%) and  conjunctivitis  (12%  vs  2%).  These  events  were  mainly  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  and infrequently resulted in dose modification. Overall, 27% of patients in the erlotinib group experienced eye disorders (including dry eyes and conjunctivitis) versus 9% in the placebo group. Most were mild in severity.

The most common serious adverse event (SAE) was dyspnea, reported for 13% of erlotinib-treated patients and 12% of patients in the placebo group. Six patients (4 erlotinib, 2 placebo) were classified as  having  ILD-like  SAEs  (i.e.,  a  0.8%  incidence  in  each  arm).  More  patients  on  erlotinib  (7%) experienced pulmonary infections compared with the placebo arm (2%). These included pneumonia, sponsor-assessed  probable  pneumonia,  lung  or  respiratory  infection,  and  lung  abscess.  However, taking into account the longer survival time and time on treatment for erlotinib-treated patients, the incidence of infections per patient week was not different between the groups. The treatment effects on hematology and blood chemistry parameters were negligible.

In  contrast  to  erlotinib,  currently  approved  chemotherapeutic  options  for  second-  and  further  line treatment of NSCLC are associated with significant toxicity. For example, docetaxel monotherapy is associated  with  the  following  common  events:  neutropenia,  anaemia,  alopecia,  nausea,  vomiting, stomatitis,  diarrhoea  and asthenia;  in  addition  to  hypersensitivity  reactions  (including  flushing,  rash with  or  without  pruritus,  chest  tightness,  back  pain,  dyspnea  and  fever  or  chills),  severe  peripheral neurotoxicity, cutaneous reactions and fluid retention, including events such as peripheral oedema and less frequently pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites and weight gain.

Pemetrexed  is  associated  with  bone  marrow  suppression  manifesting  as  anaemia,  neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia; and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities, manifesting as anorexia, nausea, vomiting,  diarrhoea,  constipation,  pharyngitis,  mucositis,  and  stomatitis.  Other  notable  undesirable effects  associated  with  pemetrexed  therapy  include  renal  toxicities,  increased  aminotransferases,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

alopecia, fatigue, dehydration, rash, infection/sepsis and neuropathy while rarely seen events include Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

The most common adverse reactions associated with recently approved immunotherapeutic agents for treatment of NSCLC either alone or in combination include fatigue, rash, pruritus, diarrhoea, nausea and  immune-related  events.  These  include  immune-related  pneumonitis  (including  ILD),  immunerelated colitis, immune-related hepatitis, immune-related endocrinopathies (such as hypophysitis, type 1  diabetes  mellitus,  diabetic  ketoacidosis,  hypothyroidism,  and  hyperthyroidism),  immune-related rash, immune-related nephritis and renal dysfunction, and infusion-related reactions. These conditions can  be  managed  with  immunosuppressive  doses  of  corticosteroids  or  other  immunosuppressive therapy and treatment modifications.

## CHMP comment

The safety profile of Erlotinib is considered to be well-established and manageable. The MAH indicates that it is not expected that the safety profile will differ for the subpopulation of NSCLC patients with WT EGFR tumours. This is acknowledged. Although the nature of the adverse events is different when comparing erlotinib and chemotherapy, the impact of the erlotinib safety profile on patients is expected to be at least similar to the impact of chemotherapy.

## 5. Request for supplementary information

## General

## Major Objection

1. Due to the results of the IUNO study (which led to the revision of the maintenance indication), the benefit/risk balance in the second-line indication in WT-EGFR tumours was, and is, called into question. The clinical evidence currently presented suggests a benefit of erlotinib over placebo, while the efficacy of erlotinib compared to chemotherapy remains inconclusive. In both cases the interpretability of the data is hampered (by e.g. limited samples size, post-hoc analyses, heterogeneity of the data, different mutational tests) and therefore the clinical efficacy of erlotinib in second- and further-line WT EGFR NSCLC remains questionable. In addition, due to the rapidly changing treatment landscape of NSCLC it is essential to pinpoint if, and if so, which patients with EGFR WT NSCLC truly benefit from the treatment with erlotinib (e.g. high EGFR expression). The information currently presented does not allow us to determine this patient population. Finally, the rationale supporting activity of Erlotinib in EGFR WT tumours, which is the fact  that EGFR signalling must be able to drive tumour growth in WT EGFR NSCLC, is build on theoretical grounds. No (non-)clinical evidence is provided by the MAH on this rational specifically.

Therefore, the benefit/risk balance is currently undetermined and the MAH is asked to provide and discuss the clinical evidence in order to support activity of erlotinib (and therefore a positive benefit/risk balance of erlotinib) as second and beyond line of treatment of NSCLC patients with EGFR WT status. The MAH is requested to included discussion, with both nonclinical and clinical evidence, on the concerns on the interpretability of the presented data, the patient population that is likely to benefit and the rational that EGFR signaling must the able to drive tumour growth in WT EGFR NSCLC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other Concerns

2. No clinical data are presented to justify the idea of Erlotinib inhibiting the IPP complex and EMT. Could the MAH discuss the available clinical data to confirm the hypothesis of Erlotinib inhibiting the IPP complex and subsequent EMT.
3. The MAH suggest that the difference between chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistant tumors is mainly based on the EGFR expression, which is higher in resistant cells. This would, in view of the MAH, constitute the rational supporting activity of erlotinib in EGFR WT NSCLC patients. However,  the early switch maintenance therapy with erlotinib performed in the IUNO study, enrolling patients with high EGFR expressing levels, did not result in a better efficacy than with placebo. Therefore,  'high' EGFR expression due to chemo-resistance cannot be the only reason for Erlotinib showing a benefit in second- and further-line treatment in EGFR WT NSCLC. The MAH should comment on this observed discrepancy.
4. The MAH suggest that no big difference can be detected between the OS of the second-line erlotinib and the second-line chemo in the IUNO study. This OS is calculated with the starting point at randomization. The MAH is requested to provide the PFS and OS with a starting point at first time PD, to see whether still no difference is found between chemotherapy and Erlotinib treatment (PFS2 and OS2).
5. In the BR.21 study only 233 of 328 samples were considered to be adequate for EGFR mutation analysis, of which in the end 204 could be tested for a EGFR mutation. The MAH is asked to elaborate on the criteria used to categorize a sample as adequate and to indicate why for 29 samples no proper mutational analysis was obtained.
6. In the BR.21 study the MAH should also present the EGFR expression level (as assessed by IHC) of patients with proper samples for mutational analysis.
7. The MAH is asked to provide data on EGFR expression level of the samples in the both the WT and squamous subgroup of the BR.21. Please provide the efficacy parameters  (PFS and OS) for patients with low and high expression status in both the WT and squamous NSCLC subgroups.
8. The role of erlotinib might differ between maintenance and second-line treatment and this might be due to differential EGFR expression in chemotherapy-sensitive and a chemotherapyresistant cells. The MAH is asked to perform subgroup analyses in the BR.21 study as a clinical argument for this hypothesis. Possible analysis that could be performed: Subgroup analysis (BR.21) on PFS and OS in patients have a response or stable disease during the chemotherapy vs. patient progressing during chemotherapy.

## 6. Assessment of the responses to the request for supplementary information

## Question 1 Major Objection

Due  to  the  results  of  the  IUNO  study  (which  led  to  the  revision  of  the  maintenance indication), the benefit/risk balance in the second-line indication in WT-EGFR tumours was, and is, called into question. The clinical evidence currently presented suggests a benefit of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

erlotinib  over  placebo,  while  the  efficacy  of  erlotinib  compared  to  chemotherapy  remains inconclusive.  In  both  cases  the  interpretability  of  the  data  is  hampered  (by  e.g.  limited samples size, post-hoc analyses, heterogeneity of the data, different mutational tests) and therefore  the  clinical  efficacy  of  erlotinib  in  second-  and  further-line  WT  EGFR  NSCLC remains  questionable.  In  addition,  due  to  the  rapidly  changing  treatment  landscape  of NSCLC it  is  essential  to  pinpoint  if,  and  if  so,  which  patients  with  EGFR  WT  NSCLC  truly benefit  from  the  treatment  with  erlotinib  (e.g.  high  EGFR  expression).  The  information currently  presented  does  not  allow  us  to  determine  this  patient  population.  Finally,  the rationale supporting activity of Erlotinib in EGFR WT tumours, which is the fact  that EGFR signalling must be able to drive tumour growth in WT EGFR NSCLC, is build on theoretical grounds. No (non-)clinical evidence is provided by the MAH on this rational specifically.

Therefore,  the  benefit/risk  balance  is  currently  undetermined  and  the  MAH  is  asked  to provide  and  discuss  the  clinical  evidence  in  order  to  support  activity  of  erlotinib  (and therefore  a  positive  benefit/risk  balance  of  erlotinib)  as  second  and  beyond  line  of treatment  of  NSCLC  patients  with  EGFR  WT  status.  The  MAH  is  requested  to  included discussion, with both non-clinical and clinical evidence, on the concerns on the interpretability of the presented data, the patient population that is likely to benefit and the rational that EGFR signaling must the able to drive tumour growth in WT EGFR NSCLC.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The  objective  of  the  IUNO  study  was  to  assess  whether  erlotinib  administered  as  first-line  (1L) maintenance  therapy  was  associated  with  better  clinical  outcome  than  erlotinib  administered  at progression (2L treatment).  Thus, the IUNO study (BO25460) only included patients who had disease control  or  were  responding  to  treatment  with  1L  chemotherapy  i.e.  the  inclusion  criterion  was  as follows:

\"Completion of four cycles of a permitted platinum-based chemotherapy without progression (i.e. CR, PR,  or  SD). This  Is  A  Mandatory  Requirement  For  Study  Entry .    A  maximum  interval  of  28  days between  the  end  of  the  last  chemotherapy  cycle  and  randomization  will  be  allowed\"  [variation EMEA/H/C/000618/II/0043; TARCEVA ®  EPAR;   IUNO CSR 1052824].

Thus, a direct comparison should not be made from the IUNO study to Study BR.21, which enrolled patients who had failed at least one line of chemotherapy and thus focusses on 2L and further lines of treatment.  It is notable that in the IUNO study there was no discernable difference in efficacy between erlotinib and chemotherapy in the 2L phase of the study.   If erlotinib had no efficacy at all in the 2L setting,  one  would  have  expected  a  difference  in  the  OS  in  those  patients  who  received  2L chemotherapy  compared  to  those  who  received  2L  erlotinib,  but  this  was  not  evident.  This  is observational as the 2L portion of the study was not randomized and not designed or powered for a 2L analysis.

The MAH acknowledges that approval of erlotinib for treatment of NSCLC after failure of at least one chemotherapy regimen was based on the positive results from the pivotal BR.21 study, which did not specifically distinguish the population of patients with WT EGFR NSCLC.  This is because the study was completed before EGFR mutation testing had been identified as a predictive biomarker [Lynch et al. 2004].  Nonetheless, the analyses on the totality of the data provided as part of this Type II variation are based on several data sets that look specifically at the effects of erlotinib in patients with WT EGFR status,  both  as  subgroup analyses  from  the  data of  Study  BR.21  and  from other  published  studies. There  are  both  preclinical  and  clinical  studies  (as  presented  below)  that  support  the  rationale  that

EGFR signaling is able to drive tumor growth and that blocking EGFR activity can meaningfully inhibit tumor growth.  Therefore, while the subgroup analyses of WT EGFR in isolation could be challenged in view of the retrospective nature and the small sample size, taken together, these data as discussed below,  consistently  support  the  conclusion  of  a  modest  but  clinically  relevant  benefit  of  erlotinib  in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC without EGFR-activating mutations after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen.  EGFR-activating mutations identify the patients who benefit the most from treatment with erlotinib, but patients without these mutations also benefit.

## PRECLINICAL  EVIDENCE  OF  THE  RATIONALE  FOR  ERLOTINIB  ACTIVITY  IN  WT  EGFR TUMORS

The role of WT EGFR as an important driver of tumorigenicity has been well established in preclinical molecular studies.  Tumors expressing mutant EGFR have been shown to have greater sensitivity to EGFR  TKIs  than  tumors  expressing  WT  EGFR,  but  inhibiting  either  type  of  EGFR  can  inhibit  tumor growth. The magnitude of tumor cell inhibition by EGFR TKIs differs between WT and mutant EGFR forms and helps to explain the spectrum of clinical activity observed.

EGFR belongs to a family of structurally related receptor tyrosine kinases that play a critical role in many cell-signaling  pathways  that  influence  cell  division,  apoptosis,  motility,  and  adhesion  [Yarden 2001].  Activated EGFR initiates a signal transduction cascade that can culminate in the activation of genes that play a critical role in tumorigenesis, tumor growth, and tumor survival.  Whereas normal cells have tightly controlled EGFR signaling [Arteaga 2002], abnormal activation (e.g. overexpression of EGFR or EGFR ligands) or dysregulation of EGFR (e.g. EGFR phosphorylation, EGFR dimerization) in normal  cells  can  result  in  the  tumorigenic  phenotype  [Salomon  et  al  1995;  Kumar  et  al  1998]. Activation of EGFR signaling can result from mechanisms other than just activating mutations, such as invasion by viral oncogenes [Miller and Raab-Traub 1999] and in response to DNA damage caused by cytotoxic treatments [Lu et al. 2011].  As the studies below show, as tumor cells develop resistance to chemotherapies in certain tumor types, they increase EGFR expression as an adaptive response and develop increased sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors.

Early  evidence  that  EGFR  can  drive  tumorigenicity  came  from  studies  showing  that  known  tumorcausing viruses encoded the EGFR proto-oncogene cellular homolog found in the avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) v-erbB as well as other cancer-causing viruses.  Cell culture studies found that conditioned media containing EGFR ligands can confer the transformed phenotype to normal cells and drive tumor cell lines to become more metastatic through the activation of WT EGFR [Todaro et al. 1980; Roberts 1980;  Sporn  and  Todaro  1980;  Todaro  et  al.  1981;  Twardzik  et  al.  1985;  Pike  et  al.  1982]. Subsequently, it was found that WT EGFR and its ligands are overexpressed or involved in autocrine growth loops in a number of tumor types, including NSCLC [Fujino et al. 1996; Rusch et al. 1997; Salomon et al. 1995].   Similarly, dysfunctional EGFR has been observed in many human cancers from colon, pancreatic, breast, ovary, bladder, kidney, gliomas, and lung [Arteaga 2002; Wells 1999].  In addition,  overexpression  and  dysregulation  of  EGFR  has  been  reported  to  be  associated  with  poor prognosis, reduced survival, resistance to chemotherapy, and resistance to hormonal therapy [Arteaga 2003; Salomon et al. 1995; Chen et al. 2000; Wosikowski et al. 2000; Tørring et al. 2000; Woodburn 1999].  These data show that EGFR signaling is able to drive tumor growth in the WT EGFR NSCLC and other tumor types.

Conversely, inactivation of EGFR pathways can significantly inhibit tumorigenesis, tumor growth and tumor  survival,  which  is  the  basis  of  the  rationale  for  the  activity  of  erlotinib  in  WT  EGFR  tumors. Erlotinib  was  shown  to  inhibit  the  autophosphorylation  of  the  EGFR  in  a  variety  of  EGFR  overexpressing tumor cells, and to cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in multiple cell types [Moyer et al.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1997;  Barbacci  et  al.  2003].    Other  preclinical  studies  with  erlotinib  found  that,  in  vivo,  erlotinib selectively inhibits WT EGFR-specific tyrosine phosphorylation in human tumor xenografts (ED50 of 10 mg/kg  p.o.  when  given  as  a  single  dose)  with  significant  duration  of  action  and  that  daily  dosing substantially inhibits growth and results in regression of human tumor xenografts [Pollack et al. 1999]. Subsequent studies using in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal models have shown anti-tumor activity by EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [Mendelsohn and Baselga 2006; Baselga 2002; Harari 2007; Arteaga 2002; Grünwald and Hidalgo 2003].

In  a  number  of  preclinical  studies,  tumor  cells  that  were  exposed  to  or  developed  resistance  to chemotherapy  or  radiation  were  observed  to  upregulate  expression  of  WT  EGFR  [Dai  et  al.  2005; Servidei at al. 2008; Naruse et al. 2002; Schmidt-Ullrich 1994; Zimmermann 2006; Kiyozuka 2013]. It was found that with upregulated WT EGFR, tumor molecular-subtypes were also more sensitive to erlotinib [Dai et al. 2005].  Although a subgroup of patients have been found to have a significantly higher response rate to EGFR TKIs due to the presence of specific mutant forms of EGFR (mtEGFR) in lung tumor biopsies, a number of other mutations have been identified in NSCLC patients that may be linked to poor responsiveness to EGFR TKIs (e.g. ALK, cMET).  The identification of mutant proteins and signaling pathways that can bypass EGFR signaling [Tsao et al. 2016 ] and can be considered for other treatments may allow for enrichment of the WT EGFR NSCLC patients, for whom EGFR TKI's still offer a reasonable treatment option.

Although  activating  EGFR  mutations  increase  the  sensitivity  of  EGFR  to  erlotinib,  WT  EGFR  is  also inhibited by erlotinib [Dai et al. 2005].  Tumor cells can upregulate expression of WT EGFR in response to the damage caused by chemotherapy [Lu et al. 2011] and subsequently develop chemo-resistance [Hsu et al. 2009].  This increased expression contributes to greater WT EGFR activity and is believed to be one of the key reasons erlotinib exerts an inhibitory effect on certain chemo-resistant, progressing tumor cells.  Thus, although there is no constitutive activation of EGFR signaling due to a mutation, there is increased presence of the EGFR, which can increase EGFR signaling in general and enhance activation of genes that play a role in tumor growth and survival.

In  summary,  WT  EGFR  is  known  to  play  an  important  role  in  the  development,  progression  and survival  of  human  epithelial  malignancies  and  is  a  relevant  target  for  antineoplastic  therapies. Consistent with this, erlotinib has been shown to inhibit tumor growth due to its interaction with WT EGFR and this may be enhanced in chemotherapy-resistant tumors.  Taken together, these preclinical studies provide evidence to support the rationale for the activity of erlotinib in chemotherapy-resistant WT EGFR tumors.

## CLINICAL EVIDENCE FOR ERLOTINIB ACTIVITY IN PATIENTS WITH WT EGFR NSCLC

There  are  several  clinical  studies,  including  the  BR.21  study,  that  assess  the  effect  of  erlotinib  in patients with WT EGFR NSCLC, and all of these studies show that these patients derive modest but clinically relevant benefit from treatment with erlotinib after failure of previous chemotherapy.

## Evidence from Study BR.21

The pivotal BR.21  study demonstrated  a  highly significant and clinically meaningful survival prolongation of erlotinib given as an oral therapy to 731 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC  after  failure  of  at  least  one  chemotherapy  regimen.    Compared  to  placebo,  erlotinib,  as  a single-agent, prolonged OS with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.73 (p = 0.001) in favor of erlotinib (median OS of 6.7 months vs 4.7 months).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients  treated  with  erlotinib  had  significantly  improved  quality  of  life  parameters,  with  delayed symptomatic deterioration of cough, dyspnea and pain compared to patients receiving placebo.   The median time to deterioration of cough was 28.1 weeks in the erlotinib arm compared to 15.7 weeks in the placebo arm, p = 0.041, HR 0.75 (95% CI, 0.56 - 1.00). For dyspnea, it was 20.4 weeks in the erlotinib arm compared to 12.1 weeks in the placebo arm, p = 0.031, HR 0.72 (95% CI, 0.56 - 0.93) and for pain it was 12.1 weeks in the erlotinib arm compared to 8.1 weeks with placebo p = 0.040, HR 0.77 (95% CI, 0.61 - 0.97). These symptom benefits could not be attributed to use of radiotherapy or concomitant medications.

The survival benefit from erlotinib was also seen in all pre-specified patient subgroups.  The robustness of the survival benefit was assessed in various subset analyses that included the stratification factors at  randomization  and  baseline.    In  addition,  an  exploratory  survival  analysis,  excluding  responding patients and patients who were not evaluable for response, showed that the median survival of the erlotinib patients was 7.4 months, compared with a median of 6.7 months in the placebo arm (HR = 0.82;  p  =  0.037).    In  patients  who  progressed  rapidly  after  initiation  of  treatment,  who  were considered non-responders, there still appears to be an observed benefit.  Thus, it appears that the overall results were not a consequence of a small group of patients who had considerable response.

The study enrolled a mixed population of NSCLC patients with WT EGFR and EGFR mutant tumors [Zhu et  al.  2008].    Although  the  BR.21  study  was  completed  before  EGFR  mutation  testing  became established  practice,  retrospective  biomarker  testing  for  EGFR  was  performed  using  tumor  samples from 233 patients.  An analysis was performed for which the WT EGFR subgroup was categorized as all patients excluding those whose tumors had exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R mutations [Zhu et al.  2008].    Another  analysis  used  a  more  conservative  approach  that  categorized  the  WT  EGFR subgroup  as  all  patients  excluding  those  whose  tumors  had  exon  19  deletions  and  exon  21  L858R mutations, and patients whose tumors had other indeterminate variants in EGFR.

The HRs for PFS and OS of the WT EGFR subgroup in the more conservative analysis, were similar to the full analysis set (FAS) population (Table 1).  The analysis showed a numerically favorable OS in the WT EGFR subgroup  with  an  unadjusted  HR  of  0.75  (95%  CI:  0.52,  1.10;  p  =  0.1443)  in  favor  of erlotinib, which was similar to the magnitude in the FAS (unadjusted HR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.91; p = 0.0018).  A PFS benefit (unadjusted HR = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.81; p = 0.0013) was observed for erlotinib compared with placebo in the WT EGFR subgroup, which was consistent with that seen in the FAS population (unadjusted HR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.75; p&lt;0.0001) (Table 1).  The WT EGFR subgroup also demonstrated a higher response rate in erlotinib-treated patients (5.9%; 95% CI: 2.2, 12.4) compared with placebo-treated patients (2.1%; 95% CI: 0.1, 11.1%) and the response rate was consistent  with  that  observed  in  the  erlotinib  arm  of  the  FAS  (8.0%;  95%  CI:  5.7,  10.8%).    Thus, these data from Study BR.21 support the conclusion of clinical benefit for erlotinib in WT EGFR patients who had failed at least one line of chemotherapy.

To further evaluate the efficacy of erlotinib in the context of EGFR WT patients, the MAH conducted two exploratory analyses of PFS and OS in clinically selected populations of patients considered to be a surrogate  for  WT  EGFR  population.    The  first  was  a  pre-specified  subgroup  analyses  based  on squamous cell histology determined at randomization and baseline in Study BR.21. The incidence of EGFR mutations in patients with squamous cell carcinoma has been reported to be low enough that the National Clinical Cancer Network (NCCN) does not recommend routine EGFR testing in this population unless they have never smoked, if only a small biopsy specimen (i.e. not a surgical resection) was used to assess histology, or if the histology is mixed [NCCN Guidelines, 2017]. Consequently, NSCLC patients with squamous cell histology subtype can be considered a clinically selected surrogate for the NSCLC EGFR WT population.

Results  of  this  subgroup  analysis  showed  that  among  patients  with  squamous  cell  histology  (144 erlotinib; 78 placebo), the median survival of patients who received erlotinib (5.57 months; 95% CI 4.67,  7.00)  was  longer  than  in  the  placebo  group  (3.58 months;  95%  CI  3.15,  4.34)  with  nonoverlapping confidence intervals. The HR of 0.67 (95% CI 0.50, 0.90) was similar to that observed in both the ITT analysis for OS reported overall in Study BR.21 (HR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.64, 0.91) and the retrospective  exploratory  subgroup  analysis  of  OS  in  WT  EGFR  patients.    Similarly,  median  PFS  for squamous cell patients receiving erlotinib was 9.86 weeks (95% CI 8.57, 15.14) compared with 7.86 weeks (95% CI 7.43, 8.14) for placebo patients. The HR of 0.53 (95% CI 0.39, 0.70) was consistent

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

both with the value observed in the overall ITT analysis for PFS (HR = 0.64; 95% CI 0.54, 0.75) and with the retrospective exploratory subgroup analysis of PFS in WT EGFR patients.

The  second  analysis  was  a  retrospective  analysis  of  the  subgroup  of  male,  smoker  (or  ex-smoker) patients  with  squamous  NSCLC  from  the  BR.21  study.    In  this  subgroup,  the  incidence  of  EGFRactivating  mutations  is  expected  to  be  even  less  frequent  than  in  the  overall  squamous  NSCLC population  because  EGFR  mutations  are  known  to  be  more  frequent  among  patients  with  female gender,  who  have  never  smoked,  and  with  non-squamous  histology  subtype  [Paz-Ares et al. 2010]. This population thus serves as a clinical surrogate for the WT EGFR population.

The  subgroup  analysis  of  male,  current  and  former  smokers  diagnosed  with  squamous  histology (n=157) demonstrated a survival benefit in favor of erlotinib, which was consistent with the results for the  FAS  in  Study  BR.21:    median  survival  times  were  5.5  months  (95%  CI:  4.1,  6.7)  in  patients treated with erlotinib and 3.4 months (95% CI: 2.9, 3.9) in patients treated with placebo.  The HR in favor  of  erlotinib  was  0.66  (95%  CI:  0.47,  0.92;  exploratory  p-value  =  0.015)  (Figure 18,  upper panel).  Similarly, median PFS was 2.4 months (95% CI: 2.0, 3.6) in patients treated with erlotinib and 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.6, 1.8) in patients treated with placebo with a HR in favor of erlotinib of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.62; exploratory p-value &lt; 0.001) (Figure 18, lower panel).

Since a higher than expected percentage of patients in both treatment groups whose tissue samples were retrospectively tested for EGFR-activating mutations showed a positive test result in this sample (3/29 [10.3%] in erlotinib patients; 5/21 [23.8%] in placebo patients), a further sensitivity analysis was conducted excluding the 8 patients who tested positive for EGFR mutations.  Results for OS and PFS remained consistent with the overall OS and  PFS analyses in male, squamous smoker patients (i.e. the WT EGFR surrogate population).  Median OS was 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.1, 6.4) in patients treated with erlotinib and 3.4 months (95% CI: 2.7, 3.9) in patients treated with placebo, with an HR in  favor  of  erlotinib  of  0.66  (95%  CI:  0.46,  0.95;  exploratory  p-value : 0.022).    Median  PFS  was 2.6 months (95% CI: 2.0, 3.6) in patients treated with erlotinib and 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.6, 1.8) in patients treated with placebo with an HR in favor of erlotinib of 0.44 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.64; exploratory p-value 0.001).    Thus,  even  after  excluding  8  patients  from  this  subgroup  with  EGFR  mutant positive NSCLC, these data still support the efficacy of erlotinib in WT EGFR patients.

Taken together, the clinical data from the pivotal BR.21 study support the conclusion that erlotinib is efficacious in EGFR WT patients. While the magnitude of erlotinib activity is higher in EGFR-activating mutations, there is a clinically meaningful effect in EGFR WT patients who had failed at least one line of chemotherapy.

## Supportive clinical studies from the literature

Several  published  papers  have  shown  erlotinib  to  have  clinical  responses  similar  to  chemotherapy (pemetrexed and docetaxel) in NSCLC WT EGFR patients.  The results of these studies are consistent in  supporting  the  benefit  of  erlotinib  in  patients  who  have  failed  at  least  one  line  of  chemotherapy across different patient populations as shown by the data from the pivotal study BR.21.

There are two published clinical studies that specifically enrolled NSCLC WT EGFR patients.  The first study,  by  Li  et  al  [2014],  was  an  open-label,  randomized  Phase  2  study  comparing  erlotinib  with pemetrexed  in  123 patients  with  confirmed  WT  EGFR  and  EGFR  fluorescence  in-situ  hybridization (FISH)-positive NSCLC who had progressed following standard platinum-based 1L chemotherapy.  The results showed no significant differences for the efficacy between erlotinib and pemetrexed.  Median PFS  was  4.1  months  (95%  CI:  1.6,  6.6)  on  erlotinib  and  3.9  months  (95%  CI:  2.7,  5.1)  on pemetrexed and the difference was not statistically significant (HR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.62, 1.37; p = 0.683).  Response rates were higher among erlotinib-treated patients compared with those receiving pemetrexed (19.7% vs 8.1%).  There was no significant difference in OS between the pemetrexed and erlotinib treatment groups (HR = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.66, 1.54).  The findings with erlotinib in this study are consistent with the results of Study BR.21.

The  second  study  (TAILOR)  was  a  multicenter,  controlled  open-label  study  which  prospectively evaluated erlotinib versus docetaxel as 2L treatment in 122 patients with confirmed WT EGFR NSCLC who  had  progressed  following  standard  platinum-based  chemotherapy;  treatment  crossover  after further disease progression was not permitted [Garassino et al. 2013].  The primary analysis of OS reported the unadjusted HR of docetaxel to erlotinib to be 0.78 (95% CI: 0.51, 1.05; p = 0.1) and the adjusted HR to be 0.73 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.00; p = 0.05).  PFS was shown to be significantly longer with docetaxel than with erlotinib with an adjusted HR = 0.71 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.95; p = 0.02) while the median PFS data were similar (2.9 months for docetaxel and 2.4 months for erlotinib).

While  the  TAILOR  study  demonstrated  a  favorable  outcome  for  docetaxel  over  erlotinib  in  this treatment setting, there are a number of issues with the study design and analyses which suggest that the  results  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  [Moro-Sibilot  et  al.  2014;  Dafni  et  al.  2014].    These include the modification of the study design after 4 out of 5 years of patient recruitment at which time the  blinded  interim  OS  results  were  known,  as  well  as  the  lack  of  Type  I  error  adjustment  of  the interim  analysis  which  led  to  the  study  design  change.    The  study  excluded  patients  who  had  prior exposure to taxanes, therefore the study population may not have been truly representative of a 2L patient population, and there were potentially important imbalances in histology and smoking status between the two treatment arms.  With regards to analysis of the study endpoints, scans were not independently reviewed, introducing the potential for bias in the interpretation of the PFS results, the adjusted  HR  for  OS  was  not  adjusted  based  on  predefined  stratification  factors,  and  there  was  no adjustment  of  the  threshold  for  statistical  significance  for  the  multiple  tests  performed  on  the  OS difference.

Notwithstanding the concerns surrounding the TAILOR study design and analysis, the difference in OS only  just  met  the  criteria  for  statistical  significance  in  the  adjusted  analysis,  while  no  statistically significant difference in OS was observed in favor of either treatment in the study by Li et al. [2014]. Taking into account the conflicting results with regards to PFS reported in these two studies and the favorable  safety  profile  of  erlotinib  versus  docetaxel  or  pemetrexed  chemotherapy,  erlotinib  and chemotherapy  can  both  be  considered  valid  treatment  options  for  WT  EGFR  NSCLC  patients  after failure of at least one chemotherapy regimen.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There  are  4  published  clinical  studies  in  which  subgroup  analyses  were  made  based  on  EGFR mutational status determined in a subset of the patients enrolled.

The  PROSE  study  randomized  patients  to  erlotinib  or  docetaxel/pemetrexed  and  EGFR  status  was determined  in  177  patients,  of  whom  163  were  WT  EGFR  [Gregorc  et  al.  2014].  Median  PFS  was shorter  in  the  erlotinib  arm,  but  median  OS  was  9.0  months  in  the  erlotinib  arm  compared  to  9.3 months in the chemotherapy arm which was not statistically significant (HR = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.75, 1.47; p = 0.757).  This study showed that erlotinib has a similar effect on OS as chemotherapy in WT EGFR NSCLC patients in the 2L setting.

The DELTA study was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, Phase 3 study conducted in 41 centers across Japan evaluating the efficacy and safety of erlotinib versus docetaxel as second- or third line therapy  in  EGFR-unselected  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC  whose  disease  had  progressed  following previous  treatment  with  one  or  two  chemotherapy  regimens,  including  at  least  one  platinum  agent [Kawaguchi et al. 2014].  Of 255 patients in whom EGFR mutational status was determined, a total of 199  patients  were  confirmed  with  WT  EGFR  tumors.    In  the  WT  EGFR  group,  median  PFS  was 1.3 months with erlotinib compared with 2.9 months with docetaxel (HR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.94; p = 0.01).    A  supportive  Cox  analysis  with  stratification  factors  confirmed  the  significant  difference (adjusted  HR  =  1.57;  95%  CI:  1.18,  2.11;  p  &lt;  0.01).    However,  there  was  no  difference  in  OS between the erlotinib and docetaxel treatment arms (HR = 0.98; p = 0.91).  The median OS was 9.0 months  (95%  CI:  7.8,  14.5)  in  the  erlotinib  group  and  10.1  months  (95%  CI:  7.3,  12.4)  in  the docetaxel  group  (95%  CI:  0.69,  1.39).    Thus,  while  this  study  in  an  EGFR-unselected  population showed a small treatment benefit with respect to PFS for patients treated with docetaxel, there was no difference between erlotinib and docetaxel with respect to OS.

The TITAN study was a multicenter, randomized, open-label Phase 3 study comparing erlotinib and chemotherapy  as  2L  treatment  in  NSCLC  patients  [Ciuleanu  et  al.  2012].    The  study  was  halted prematurely due to slow recruitment after a median follow up of 27.9 months in the erlotinib arm and 24.8 months in the chemotherapy arm.  As a result, the statistical plan was modified and the power of the statistical analyses to detect a difference in OS between treatments was reduced to 60%, hence, some of the analyses were underpowered to detect clinically meaningful treatment effects.  Median OS was 5.3 months in the overall population, and there were no differences between the 2 treatment arms in  terms of OS in the WT EGFR subpopulation, where the median OS was approximately 7 months. These results are consistent with the results of the BR.21 study.

The HORG study investigated the efficacy of erlotinib compared to pemetrexed in the 2L and 3L setting [Karampeazis et al. 2013].  There were 112 patients with confirmed WT EGFR status.  There was no difference in terms of OS between the treatment arms (HR = 1.19; 95% CI: 0.77; 1.84); median OS in the erlotinib group was 9.7 months.  Thus, pemetrexed and erlotinib showed comparable efficacy in this population of pre-treated patients with metastatic NSCLC.

Since the rate of EGFR mutations is very low in squamous cell histology [NCCN guidelines], this patient population may be considered as a clinically selected surrogate for the NSCLC EGFR WT population. Thus,  the  LUX-lung  8  study,  which  enrolled  patients  with  squamous  NSCLC,  can  be  considered  a clinically selected WT EGFR population and contributes to the overall picture consistently showing that erlotinib  has  an  effect  in  WT  EGFR  patients.    This  study,  which  led  to  the  approval  of  afatinib  (an irreversible,  pan-HER inhibitor) in  squamous cell carcinoma, was a Phase 3, open-label, randomized study using erlotinib as a comparator in 795 patients with Stage IIIB/IV squamous cell carcinoma that had failed 1L therapy [Soria et al. 2015].  In this patient population (used as a clinical surrogate for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

WT EGFR patients in Study BR.21), erlotinib had a median OS of 6.8 months, which was consistent with the effect seen in the squamous cell subgroup analyzed in Study BR.21.

To look more closely at the significance of the data from these studies as a whole, meta-analyses of pooled  data  from  these  clinical  studies  were  performed  and  showed  no  statistically  significant difference in OS between erlotinib and chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC with WT EGFR. The first  of  these  meta-analyses  combined  data  from  Phase  2  or  Phase  3  prospective,  randomized, controlled clinical studies where patients had histologically confirmed Stage IIIb or IV NSCLC with WT EGFR  tumors  or  where  a  subgroup  analysis  for  WT  EGFR  patients  had  been  performed,  the experimental group had received gefitinib or erlotinib, and the control group had received chemotherapy  [Zhao  2014].    Based  on  these  criteria,  6  studies  were  included  with  data  from 990 patients with WT EGFR tumors.  Among the 3 large studies comparing erlotinib to chemotherapy, there  was  no  difference  in  OS  between  patients  treated  with  erlotinib  and  those  treated  with chemotherapy (HR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.26, p = 0.84) (Table 3).  There was also no significant difference in OS between any EGFR-TKI and chemotherapy groups across all 6 studies (HR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.87, 1.20, p = 0.81)).

A  second  meta-analysis  was  based  on  a  systematic  review  of  studies  of  EGFR  TKIs  versus chemotherapy  as  2L  therapy  after  first-line  chemotherapy  in  randomized  patients  with  advanced NSCLC WT EGFR tumors and patients with tumors harboring EGFR mutations, irrespective of sex, age, histology, ethnicity, smoking history, or EGFR mutational status, and who had not received prior TKI treatment [Vale et al, 2015].  Based on these criteria, 9 studies were included with data from 1302 patients (including studies evaluated in the meta-analysis by Zhao et al [2014]).  Results showed a PFS HR of 1.31 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.48; P &lt; 0.0001) in favor of chemotherapy.  There was no evidence in this meta-analysis of a difference between the effect of TKIs or chemotherapy on OS (HR = 1.06; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.22).

Thus,  these  meta-analyses  show  that  both  erlotinib  and  chemotherapy  can  be  considered  as  valid treatment options with clinical benefit for WT EGFR NSCLC patients in the 2L and further line settings.

In  summary,  the  pattern  that  emerges  on  looking  across  all  of  these  clinical  studies  that  either specifically enrolled WT EGFR patients or included subgroups of WT EGFR patients, is that there is no discernable difference in efficacy with erlotinib compared to chemotherapy with a favorable safety and tolerability profile for erlotinib in patients with WT EGFR in second or further lines of treatment.

## Supportive case studies from the literature

There are two published case studies that demonstrate a positive response to erlotinib in the 2L setting in WT EGFR patients who did not have the clinical predictors of positive outcome as previously reported in the literature.  These cases emphasize the importance of considering erlotinib as a treatment option for any patient in the 2L, 3L or maintenance setting.

The first was published in 2012 and reports on a 71-year-old white man with a 50 pack-year history of smoking who had stage IV NSCLC that was WT EGFR [Karam and Melosky 2012].  The patient initially had  partial  response  (PR)  after  radiotherapy  and  3  cycles  of  chemotherapy  (first-line  gemcitabinecisplatin)  but  an  additional  node  was  identified  2 weeks  after  completion  of  the  4 th cycle  of chemotherapy.  Erlotinib treatment was initiated as 2L therapy on 24 August 2010.  After 18 days at 150 mg daily, treatment was stopped for 2 weeks due to a grade 3 rash, then reinitiated at 100 mg daily on 4 October 2010.  By 26 October 2010, 2 of 3 lesions had decreased in size and the third was no  longer  measurable.    The  dose  was  increased  again  to  150 mg  daily  in  January  2011  due  to  an improvement  in  the  rash.    Subsequent  CT  scans  in  February  2011  showed  that  the  3  lesions  had achieved PR according to RECIST criteria.  The patient was still on erlotinib treatment after 6 months and the authors anticipate that he would achieve a survival benefit because he had already exceeded the PFS of 2.2 months reached in the BR.21 study.

The second case was published in 2017 and reports on a 65-year-old white man who was a heavy smoker with WT EGFR squamous NSCLC [Gambale et al. 2017].  After surgical right pneumonectomy and ipsilateral hilar-mediastinal lymphadenectomy in October 2009, at which point a CT scan found no evidence of metastasis, the first  post-surgery  CT scan,  in  January  2010,  revealed  new  nodules  and spleen  metastasis.    The  patient  received  first-line  chemotherapy  (4  cycles  of  carboplatin  and gemcitabine) but continued to progress.  Second-line, weekly docetaxel chemotherapy was stopped after  the  first  cycle  due  to  grade  4  neutropenia  and  atrial  fibrillation.    Due  to  the  short  disease progression-free  interval  and  limiting  bone  marrow  toxicity,  further  chemotherapy  was  ruled  out. Erlotinib was started (150 mg/day) in March 2011, but was reduced to 100 mg/day after 1 month due

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to  grade  3  skin  rash.    The  first  post-treatment  CT  scan  revealed  stable  disease  (SD)  according  to RECIST criteria.  The second CT scan, 4 months later, revealed continued SD with continued reduction of  the  paraesophageal lesion.    Other than  the  skin  toxicity,  no  other  AEs  were  reported.    CT  scans performed every 4 months confirmed SD for 5 years after beginning erlotinib therapy, but due to the skin  toxicity  erlotinib  treatment  was  then  stopped  in  March  2016.    Disease  progression  was documented 2 months after stopping erlotinib (May 2016).

## CHMP assessment of the MAH's response

The IUNO study, which has been assessed in a previous variation, showed no benefit of early erlotinib treatment in patients with NSCLC without known EGFR activating mutations compared to placebo. In response to this IUNO study, the FDA decided to limit both the early switch-maintenance indication in and  the  second  line  indication..  In  the  EU,  the  IUNO  study  led  to  the  revision  of  the  maintenance indication and the benefit/risk balance in the second-line indication after failure of prior chemotherapy came into question, in particular for the patients without an EGFR mutation.

The MAH was asked to provide additional discussion on the clinical evidence in order to support activity of  erlotinib  (and  therefore  a  positive  benefit/risk  balance  of  erlotinib)  as  second  and  beyond  line  of treatment of NSCLC patients with EGFR WT status. In the discussion the MAH was asked to include the concerns on the interpretability of the presented data, the patient population that is likely to benefit and the rational that EGFR signaling must the able to drive tumour growth in WT EGFR NSCLC.

## 1. Discuss the concerns on the presented data.

The subgroup analysis in WT EGFR patients of the BR.21 study is discussed in the initial application. However,  the  interpretability  of  the  data  is  hampered  by  the  post-hoc  nature  of  the  analyses.  The applicant agrees that these data 'could be challenged in view of the retrospective nature and the small sample  size'.  However,  the  applicant  indicates  that  the  presented  data  in  the  answer  consistently support the conclusion of a modest but clinically relevant benefit of erlotinib in patients with WT EGFR NSCLC. However, in the presented literature no clear distinction is made between EGFR and WT-EGFR. At the time that the presented literature was published, the activating mutation were not described yet and specific testing for these mutations was not yet common practice. Therefore, these publications do not provide the evidence specifically for WT-EGFR signalling, while needed for the purpose of this PAM

Furthermore, no additional/new information was provided in the discussion on the concerns raised for the subgroup analyses of the BR.21 study performed in NSCLC patients with EGFR WT status and/or with  squamous  histology.  Therefore,  the  interpretability  of  the  data  on  the  efficacy  of  erlotinib compared to placebo is still hampered by the fact that analyses have been performed post-hoc and the possibility for false positives.

The other clinical data presented by literature studies do not provide enough evidence to overcome the concerns we have on the efficacy of erlotinib in the WT-EGFR NSCLC patients. The presented data still consist  of  a  highly  heterogeneous  group  of  publications  related  to  several  studies  performed  in different  populations,  and/or  in  different  treatment  setting  and/or  employing  different  comparators. The interpretation of the results is hampered in several studies due to the limited sample size and the fact that EGFR WT patients represented only subgroups of the population treated in the study. Overall, conflicting results are presented in the literature, ranging from studies (e.g., TAILOR) clearly indicating superiority  of  chemotherapy  vs  erlotinib  in  terms  of  PFS  and  OS  in  EGFR  WT  patients  and  other trials/subgroup analyses suggesting no significant difference in OS when comparing chemotherapy to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

erlotinib  (for  the  TITAN,  DELTA  and  PROSE  trial).  To  be  noted,  a  numerical  trend  in  median  PFS favouring chemotherapy was identified in all these trial.

In this round, the applicant proved new data by means of two case studies were presented. A 71-yearold  white  man  with  stage  IV  NSCLC  that  was  WT-EGFR,  which  had  PR  of  3  lesions  after  erlotinib treatment (still  on  erlotinib  after  6  months)  and  a  65-year-old  white  man  with  WT  EGFR  squamous NSCLC who had stable disease for 5 years after beginning erlotinib therapy (treatment stopped due to skin  toxicity).  Both  case  studies  point  towards  an  effect  of  erlotinib  in  these  WT-EGFR  patients. However, two case studies do not provide enough reliable evidence for erlotinib to be effective over chemotherapy in the general WT-EGFR NSCLC population.

In conclusion, the concerns on the interpretability of the clinical evidence to support erlotinib efficacy in WT-EGFR  NSLCLC  currently presented (by e.g. limited samples size, post-hoc analyses, heterogeneity of the data, different mutational tests) persist and therefore the extent of clinical benefit of erlotinib in second- and further-line WT EGFR NSCLC remains unclear.

## 2. Discuss the patient population that is likely to benefit

The applicant indicates that the patients population that benefits the most is the patients with EGFRactivating  mutation,  but  that  patients  without  these  mutations  may  also  benefit.  Unfortunately  the applicant did not discuss which specific patient population is likely to benefit among the patients with WT EGFR NSCLC. Due to the rapidly changing treatment landscape of NSCLC it is essential to pinpoint if, and if so, which patients with EGFR WT NSCLC truly benefit from the treatment with erlotinib.

It has been hypothesized that patients who failed chemotherapy and might therefore be chemotherapy-resistant  exhibit  higher  EGFR-expression.  As  mentioned  in  the  MAHs  response  to question 3 and 7, a differential response might exist in patients with low or high WT-EGFR expression. This conclusion is supported by the study by Li et al, in which only high EGFR expressing patients were included and comparable OS was seen when comparing erlotinib and chemotherapy (numerically) in favour of chemotherapy. It should be mentioned that, in the additional analysis performed by the MAH, the EGFR WT subgroup was defined as all patients excluding those subjects whose tumours had exon 19  deletions  and  exon  21  L858R  mutations.  Therefore  patient  with  other  indeterminate  variants  in EGFR were included (Zhu et al). Inclusion of the patients with indeterminate variants in EGFR hampers the  interpretation  of  the  results,  as  these  patients  might  exhibit  EGFR  variants  that  do  show constitutively active EGFR and therefore a rational for erlotinib efficacy. Although the data should be interpreted with caution, the analyses in response to question 7 (low vs high EGFR expression) suggest that patients expressing low amounts of WT-EGFR do not benefit from erlotinib treatment. This results in a negative B/R in these low expressing patients. The determination of EGFR-expression level is not common in clinical practice. Furthermore, no reliable standards and/or cut-offs exist to determine high and  low  EGFR  expression  in  a  consistent  manner.  Therefore,  in  clinical  practice  WT-EGFR  NSCLC patients  that  possibly  benefit  from  erlotinib  treatment  cannot  be  determined  and  the  extent  of  the clinical benefit of erlotinib in the overall WT-EGFR population remains questionable.

## 3. The rational that EGFR signaling must the able to drive tumour growth in WT EGFR NSCLC.

The  applicant  was  asked  to  provide  both  pre-clinical  and  clinical  data  to  show  that  is  WT  EGFR signaling is able to drive tumour growth in patients with WT EGFR NSCLC.

It has been known for a long time that EGFR signaling is able to activate pathways related to tumor

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

growth. However, as discussed above, the pre-clinical data presented is based on EGFR research from an era before the existence of EGFR mutation was identified. Some of the referred pre-clinical studies make  use  of  cancer  cell  lines.  These  cancer  cell-lines  might  contain  mutated  instead  of  WT  EGFR. Therefore,  it  is  not  clear  whether  the  presented  evidence  may  be  100%  attributed  to  WT  EGFR signaling specifically.

In addition, no (pre-) clinical evidence was presented to prove that this increased WT-EGFR expression result  in  increased  activation  of  the  WT  EGFR  signaling  cascade  and  subsequently  is  able  to  be  the driving force of tumour growth in patients with WT EGFR NSCLC.

## Conclusion

The benefit/risk balance of erlotinib in the second-line and beyond treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic WT-EGFR NSCLC remains undetermined for the following reasons:

First, the concerns persist on the interpretability of the currently presented clinical evidence to support erlotinib efficacy in comparison to both placebo as chemotherapy in WT-EGFR NSLCLC (by e.g. limited samples size, post-hoc analyses, heterogeneity of the data, different mutational tests).

Second, it has been known for a long time that EGFR signalling is able to activate pathways related to tumour growth, however, based on the presented (pre-)clinical evidence it is unclear to what extent the activity can be attributed to WT EGFR signalling specifically.

Therefore,  the  Major  Objection  is  NOT  resolved  and  the  benefit/risk  balance  cannot  be established in the NSCLC patients with WT EGFR mutations.

During the procedure the MAH has proposed to reflect the uncertainties in relation to the 2 nd -line and beyond NSCLC indication including the following wording in section 4.1 of the SmPC:

Tarceva is also indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. In patients with tumours without EGFR activating mutations, Tarceva is indicated, when other treatment options are not considered suitable.

The CHMP agreed to this revision of the indication.

## Point resolved.

## Question 2

No clinical data are presented to justify the idea of erlotinib inhibiting the ILK-parvin-PINCH (IPP) complex and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).  Could the MAH discuss the available clinical data to confirm the hypothesis of erlotinib inhibiting the IPP complex and subsequent EMT.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The MAH is not suggesting that the hypothesis for the ability of erlotinib to inhibit the IPP complex or the EMT is the main mode of action of erlotinib, which is via direct and reversible inhibition of the EGFR tyrosine  kinase,  but  simply  that  these  other  activities  may  also  play  a  secondary  role  in  erlotinib's

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

activity in WT EGFR [Zhang et al. 2009; Augustin et al. 2013].  There are no clinical data to support this hypothesis; these secondary pathways of activity were discussed as an exploration of reasons for why erlotinib exhibits activity in the WT EGFR tumors in clinical studies when gefitinib does not, as a component of the totality of our current knowledge.

One additional reason for the difference between the effect of erlotinib and gefitinib in WT EGFR NSCLC patients  has  been  suggested  to  be  the  higher  exposure/mg  dose  that  is  obtained  with  erlotinib compared with gefitinib.  The therapeutic dose of erlotinib is 150 mg/day (max tolerated dose), which results in an AUC of 38.42 µg*h/mL, and is 7-fold higher than the exposure obtained at the gefitinib therapeutic  dose  (250  mg/day)  [Bronte  2014].    For  gefitinib  to  reach  a  comparable  AUC  of  36.08 µg*h/mL,  an  estimated  dose  of  700  mg/day  would  be  required,  which  is  2.8-fold  higher  than  the gefitinib therapeutic dose of 250 mg/day.  Preclinical studies found that higher exposures of erlotinib were  needed  to  inhibit  the  growth  of  EGFR  WT  tumors  compared  to  EGFR  mutant  tumors  [SiegelLakhai et al. 2005; Carey et al. 2006].  In addition, the major metabolite of erlotinib retains most of its EGFR inhibitory activity whereas the major metabolite of gefitinib is significantly less active, which may also  contribute  to  the  observed  difference  in  clinical  outcome  [erlotinib  Investigators  Brochure; McKillop et al. 2006].

## CHMP assessment of the MAH's response

It is acknowledged that the possible inhibition of the IPP complex may also play a secondary role in erlotinib's activity in WT EGFR. However, this idea and the idea regarding higher exposure of erlotinib compared to gefitinib remain suggestive rove.

As  no  clinical  data  on  inhibition  of  the  IPP  complex  by  Erlotinib  is  available,  no  further  action  is required on this question.

## Issue Resolved.

## Question 3

The MAH suggest that the difference between chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistant tumors is mainly based on the EGFR expression, which is higher in resistant cells.  This would, in view of the MAH, constitute the rationale supporting activity of erlotinib in EGFR WT NSCLC patients.  However, the early switch maintenance therapy with erlotinib performed in the IUNO study, enrolling patients with high EGFR expressing levels, did not result in a better efficacy  than  with  placebo.    Therefore,  'high'  EGFR  expression  due  to  chemo-resistance cannot be the only reason for erlotinib showing a benefit in 2L- and further-line treatment in EGFR WT NSCLC.  The MAH should comment on this observed discrepancy

## Summary of the MAH's response

EGFR expression levels were not tested as part of the IUNO study and high EGFR expression levels were not an inclusion criterion for the IUNO study.  The only enrollment criterion related to EGFR was exclusion of patients whose tumors harbored an EGFR-activating mutation (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutations, either known at screening or confirmed by central testing before randomization).

The reason early switch maintenance therapy with erlotinib did not result in a better efficacy than with placebo  in  the  IUNO  study  may  be  because  the  study  was  restricted  to  patients  who  had  disease control or  showed a response to treatment with their 1L chemotherapy (i.e. patients who were not chemotherapy resistant).  Based on the preclinical findings from published literature WT EGFR patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

who have disease control or response to 1L therapy (i.e. those patients enrolled in the IUNO study) are not likely to benefit from treatment with a TKI.

Disease progression in patients treated with chemotherapy  develops as  tumor cells acquire chemotherapy  resistance.    Preclinical  and  clinical  observations  suggest  that  as  tumors  develop resistance to chemotherapy, they develop a greater dependence on EGFR activity, which is associated with  increased  expression  of  EGFR  (see  the  response  to  Question  1).    The  upregulation  of  EGFR expression  in  response  to  chemotherapy  resistance,  and  the  associated  increased  EGFR  activity,  is linked  to  acquired  sensitivity  to  EGFR  TKI's. Preclinical  data  from  parental  tumor  cell  lines (chemosensitive)  with  chemotherapy  drug-resistant  variants  of  those  cell  lines  showed  that  some tumor  cells  with  initial  low  EGFR  expression  levels  and  thus  sensitivity  to  erlotinib  increased  the expression  of  EGFR  and  developed  greater  sensitivity  to  erlotinib  when  they  became  resistant  to chemotherapy [Dai et al. 2005].  Similar increased   expression and greater EGFR TKI sensitivity by drug  resistant  tumor  cells  has  been  observed  in  breast  cancer  cells  that  have  become  resistant  to tamoxifen [Britton 2006; Knowlden 2003; Massarweh 2008; Nicholson 2001; Osborne 2011].  Hence, patients treated in 1L maintenance who have not progressed on chemotherapy (IUNO population) may not derive any benefit from the addition of a TKI after completion of 4 cycles of chemotherapy whereas patients who have failed at least one course of chemotherapy and are chemotherapy resistant (BR.21 population), develop additional EGFR expression and activity that may positively influence response to treatment with a TKI.

As a result, patients treated with erlotinib after failure of at least one chemotherapy and progression of disease (i.e. chemotherapy-resistant patients and those enrolled in the BR.21 study) may respond to erlotinib  due  to  a  higher  expression  and  activity  of  EGFR.    This  is  consistent  with  the  improved response to erlotinib compared to placebo that was seen in the BR.21 study.

This is also supported by the observation in the IUNO study that there was no discernable difference in survival when comparing patients treated with 2L erlotinib and 2L chemotherapy.  If erlotinib had no efficacy at all in the 2L setting, one would have expected some incremental difference in OS in those patients who received 2L chemotherapy compared to 2L erlotinib, but this was not evident.  Although the 2L portion of the study was not randomized nor designed or powered for a 2L efficacy analysis, the lack of a discernable difference between erlotinib and chemotherapy in the 2L phase of the IUNO study is  consistent  with  the  published  data  presented  in  the  response  to  Question  1  (Clinical  evidence) supporting comparability of erlotinib and chemotherapy in 2L.  It is also consistent with the outcome of the  OS  analysis  requested  in  Question  4,  which  suggest  that  patients  benefited  to  a  similar  extent whether taking erlotinib or chemotherapy in 2L (see the response to Question 4).

Thus, the findings of the IUNO study in patients who were responding to their chemotherapy, and the findings  of  the  BR.21  study  in  patients  whose  disease  progressed  on  chemotherapy,  are  consistent with the proposed difference between chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistant tumors being based in part on EGFR expression and increased EGFR activity in those tumors.  Further analyses based on EGFR expression levels in Study BR.21 have been presented in the response to Question 8.

## CHMP assessment of the MAH's response

In the Tarceva EPAR it is stated that in the IUNO study all eligible patients were to have known EGFR by immunohistochemistry (IHC) status. This was interpreted in a way that all patients had to have known/measurable EGFR expression addressed by IHC. As apparently these patients did not have to have high EGFR expression no discrepancy is observed.

Conclusion: Issue resolved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Question 4

The MAH suggest that no big difference can be detected between the OS of the 2L erlotinib and the 2L chemotherapy in the IUNO study.  This OS is calculated with the starting point at randomization.  The MAH is requested to provide the PFS and OS with a starting point at first  time progression of disease (PD) to see whether still no difference is found between chemotherapy and erlotinib treatment (PFS2 and OS2)

## Summary of the MAH's response

As requested, the analysis of OS has been performed and is provided below.  It was not possible to perform the analysis of PFS as requested, the reasons for which are discussed below.

## OS2 ANALYSIS (IUNO STUDY)

For  the  OS2  analysis,  281  patients  were  randomized  to  the  late  erlotinib  arm  and  could  receive erlotinib in 2L and 264 patients to the early erlotinib arm and could receive chemotherapy in 2L.  There was no relevant difference in OS2 between the two treatment arms (Table 3 and Figure 19).  Median OS  was  similar  for  both  arms:  6.24 months  for  late  erlotinib  and  6.51 months  for  early  erlotinib (HR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.8, 1.18).  Taken together, these analyses suggest that patients benefited to a similar extent whether taking erlotinib or chemotherapy in 2L.

## PFS2 ANALYSIS

According to the IUNO study protocol, after the patient had PD during the blinded phase, they could enter the open-label phase.  However, patients in the open-label phase who had PD were managed according to local clinical practice (including drug administration, dose modification, tumor assessment schedule and methodology, and other factors).  As a result, only 23 patients (5 randomized to the erlotinib arm and 18 to the placebo arm in the blinded phase) had tumor assessments after first time PD.  Due to the limited and unbalanced number of patients with data, PFS2 analysis would not give meaningful results.

## CHMP assessment of the MAH's response

The applicant provided the analysis as requested for OS2 and was not able to provide the data for PFS2  as  tumour  assessments  were  done  routinely  done  at  this  point  in  the  study.  The  applicant concludes that the OS analyses suggest that patient benefit to a similar extent when taking erlotinib or chemotherapy in 2L. Only OS2 data is available, which in this case is unfortunate as the patient were also  treated  3L/4L  with  investigators  choice.  The  exact  contribution  of  these  treatment  cannot  be determined without the PFS2 analysis.

Conclusion: No further action is required.

## Issue Resolved

## Question 5

In  the  BR.21  study  only  233  of  328 samples  were  considered  to  be  adequate  for  EGFR mutation analysis, of which in the end 204 could be tested for a EGFR mutation.  The MAH is asked to elaborate on the criteria used to categorize a sample as adequate and to indicate

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## why for 29 samples no proper mutational analysis was obtained.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The final study report for the BR.21 study was issued in 2004.  Since activating-EGFR mutations were not identified as a predictive biomarker before 2004 [Lynch et al. 2004], the study had not planned analyses of EGFR mutational status.  During the original study, 328 samples had been obtained for biomarker analysis according to the protocol (i.e. there was a biopsy sample for which the tissue was adequate for at least one biomarker analysis and for which informed consent had been obtained).

Post-hoc mutational analyses were subsequently performed. At the time of the post-hoc mutational analyses,  the  samples  collected  in  the  original  study  were  assessed  histologically by  a  pathologist. Over  the  course  of  the  analyses,  233  (71%  of  the  original  set)  samples  were  identified  that  were considered adequate, meaning they yielded sufficient DNA to amplify either all of exons 18 through 21 or just exons 19 and 21 alone [Tsao et al. 2005; Zhu et al. 2008].  The purified PCR products obtained from  the  DNA  samples  were  sequenced  in  both  directions  and  only  sequence  variations  that  were present in both directions in more than 15 percent of specimens were included in the analysis.  As a result, of 233 samples with sufficient DNA for sequencing, mutational results were obtained for 204 patients [Zhu et al. 2008].

It  is  not  unusual  that  not  all  samples  collected  during  a  study  have  adequate  tissue  to  allow  for mutational testing.  In studies for which testing is done retrospectively, it is often problematic to get tissue samples from such a large proportion of the study population; tissue samples are often limited and  may  be  subject  to  assay  prioritization,  which  further  reduces  the  samples  available  for  the retrospectively planned tests.  Thus, in the MAH experience, a sample size of 71% of the originally obtained samples is not unusual for a retrospective analysis and represents a large proportion of the available samples from Study BR.21.

## CHMP assessment of the MAH's response

The  applicant  explained  in  more  detail  how  the  mutation  analysis  was  performed  and  why  some samples were considered inadequate for analysis, mostly related to amount and quality of DNA.

## Issue Resolved

## Question 6

In the BR.21 study the MAH should also present the EGFR expression level (as assessed by IHC) of patients with proper samples for mutational analysis.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The requested data showing high (≥10%) and low (&lt;10%) EGFR expression levels in patients with EGFR mutation status are provided in

Table 4 .  The EGFR WT subgroup was defined as all patients excluding those whose tumors had exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R mutations [Zhu et al. 2008].  Due to the small sample size in these subgroups, the results should be interpreted with caution.

## Issue Resolved

## Question 7

The MAH is asked to provide data on EGFR expression level of the samples in both the WT and squamous subgroup of the BR.21.  Please provide the efficacy parameters (PFS and OS) for  patients  with  low  and  high  expression  status  in  both  the  WT  and  squamous  NSCLC subgroups.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The requested subgroup analyses have been performed and are presented below.

Of the samples tested, 85 out of 170 (50%) of the WT EGFR patients had high expression and 66 out of  170  patients  (39%)  had  low  expression.    The  EGFR  WT  subgroup  was  defined  as  all  patients excluding those whose tumors had exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R mutations [Zhu et al. 2008]. For the squamous NSCLC subgroup, 41 out of 222 patients (18.5%) had high EGFR expression and 26 out of 222 patients (11.7%) had low expression (Table 5).

Post-hoc analyses were conducted to analyze PFS and OS for patients with high and low expression status (defined by the ≥10% vs &lt;10% staining) in both the WT EGFR and squamous NSCLC subgroups in  Study  BR.21.    Due  to  the  small  sample  size  in  these  subgroups,  especially  in  the  high  and  low expression subgroups in squamous patients, these results should be interpreted with caution.

In the WT EGFR subgroup, analyses suggest that the EGFR high expression group may derive more benefit from erlotinib than the EGFR low expression group.  For PFS the median time to event was 9.57 weeks in the high expression group compared to 8.14 weeks in the low expression group, with an HR of  0.8  (95%  CI:  0.57,  1.11)  (Table 6).    While  there  was  little  difference  in  PFS  between  erlotinib (median time to event 8.21 weeks) and placebo (median time to event 8.14 weeks) in low expression patients, in high expression patients PFS was considerably longer in the erlotinib patients (median time to event 17.43 weeks) compared to the placebo patients (median time to event 7.14 weeks), with a HR of 0.32 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.52) (Table 7 and Figure 20).

The same outcome was seen for OS where the median time to event was 7.92 months in the high expression group compared to 6.28 months in the low expression group, with an HR of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.57, 1.16) (Table 8).  The difference in OS between erlotinib (median time to event 5.9 months) and placebo (median time to event 7.04 months) was minimal in low expression patients, while in high expression patients OS  was  notably  longer in the erlotinib patients (median  time  to event 11.53 months) compared to the placebo patients (median time to event 3.02 months), with an HR of 0.5 (95% CI: 0.3, 0.85) (Table 9 and Figure 21 ).

## SQUAMOUS NSCLC SUBGROUP

A  similar  trend  was  seen  in  the  squamous  NSCLC  subgroup.    Although  data  are  limited,  they  also suggest the EGFR high expression group may derive more benefit from erlotinib than the EGFR low expression group.  The median time to event for PFS was 9.36 weeks in the high expression group compared  to  7.79  weeks  in  the  low  expression  group,  with  an  HR  of  0.72  (95%  CI:  0.43,  1.2) (Table 10).    While  there  was  little  difference  in  PFS  between  erlotinib  (median  time  to  event  8.00 weeks) and placebo (median time to event 7.43 weeks) in low expression patients, in high expression patients  PFS  was  considerably  longer  in  the  erlotinib  patients  (median  time  to  event  15.14 weeks) compared to the placebo patients (median time to event 8.29 weeks), with an HR of 0.39 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.79) (Table 11).

In the squamous subgroup, the median time to event for OS was 5.52 months in the high expression group compared to 4.67 months in the low expression group, with an HR of 0.8 (95% CI: 0.48, 1.33) (Table 12).    As  for  PFS,  in  the  high  expression  patients,  OS  was  longer  in  the  erlotinib  patients (median time to event 7.66 months) compared to the placebo patients (median time to event 3.45 months), with  an  HR  of  0.27  (95%  CI:  0.12,  0.58)  (Table 13).    In  the  low  expression  groups,  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

opposite was seen: OS was shorter in erlotinib patients (median time to event 4.14 months) than in placebo patients (median time to event 7.49 months).  Owing to the very small sample size of these treatment arms, it is difficult to comment on the relevance of this difference.

## CHMP assessment of the MAH's response

The  requested  analyses  are  performed  and  presented.  It  is  acknowledged  that  the  sample  sizes  of these requested analyses are low. Nevertheless they provide a hint toward the population with higher (WT)-EGFR expression, which seems have a benefit from erlotinib treatment.

It should be mentioned that the EGFR WT subgroup was defined as all patients excluding those whose tumours  had  exon  19  deletions  and  exon  21  L858R  mutations.  Therefore  patient  with  other indeterminate variants in EGFR were included (Zhu et al). Inclusion of the patients with indeterminate variants  in  EGFR  hampers  the  interpretation  of  the  results,  as  these  patients  might  exhibit  EGFR variants that do show constitutively active EGFR and therefore a rational for erlotinib efficacy.

## Question 8

The role of erlotinib might differ between maintenance and 2L treatment and this might be due  to  differential  EGFR  expression  in  chemotherapy-sensitive  and  a  chemotherapyresistant cells.    The  MAH  is  asked  to  perform  subgroup  analyses  in  the  BR.21  study  as  a clinical argument for this hypothesis.  Possible analysis that could be performed: Subgroup analysis (BR.21) on PFS and OS in patients who have a response or stable disease during the chemotherapy vs. patient progressing during chemotherapy.

## Summary of the MAH's response

As  noted  in  the  response  to  Question  3,  EGFR  expression  is  not  the  main  differentiator  between chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistant tumour response to EGFR TKIs.  The important difference is the change  in  usage  of  EGFR  by  the  tumour  as  they  adapt  from  chemo-sensitive  to  become  chemoresistant tumors, where increased expression of EGFR is one of the indicators of this adaptation.

Since all patients enrolled in the BR.21 study had disease which had progressed on chemotherapy (i.e. had  chemotherapy-resistant  disease),  it  was  not  possible  to  test  a  clinical  hypothesis  comparing patients who are sensitive to chemotherapy with patients who are resistant to chemotherapy.

However, in response to the request for a subgroup analysis to explore the role of erlotinib in WT EGFR maintenance  and  2L  treatment,  subgroup  analyses  were  made  looking  at  differences  in  the  best response to therapy prior to failing to respond to chemotherapy (Table 14).  The response to erlotinib was compared between patients whose best response had been PD and thus had an immediate failure to respond to chemotherapy (i.e., an intrinsic resistance) and those patients whose best response was either  SD or  partial  or  complete  response  and  thus  only  stopped  responding  to  chemotherapy  after having initially  responded (i.e., an acquired resistance).  Although the subgroup of patients with an immediate failure  to  respond  to  chemotherapy  cannot  be  seen  as  a  surrogate  for  patients  who  are sensitive to chemotherapy, the subgroup of patients who stopped responding to chemotherapy later on treatment can be seen as a surrogate for patients who have been on chemotherapy long enough to have  acquired  chemotherapy  resistance  and  the  associated  increase  in  EGFR  expression  associated with this state.

This analysis was presented in the BR.21 study report as a subgroup analysis of best response to prior chemotherapy.  It must be acknowledged that this analysis was an underpowered exploratory analysis, and no adjustments were made for the multiplicity of inferences in these subgroups.  In addition, this comparison  is  clearly  confounded  by  other  factors  such  as  the  extent  of  disease  upon  initiation  of treatment and how this relates to treatment failure.

Nonetheless, this analysis showed that patients who had a response or SD during prior chemotherapy (i.e. those that had acquired chemotherapy resistance) had a more beneficial response to treatment with  erlotinib  than  those  who  had  PD  (i.e.,  had  an  immediate  failure  to  respond  to  chemotherapy) (Table 14).  This would be consistent with the idea that stopping to respond to chemotherapy after an initial response may be associated with more tumour evolution in terms of an increase in expression of EGFR.

## CHMP assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH  tried to provided data from  the BR.21  study to provide evidence for  the  EGFR expression/chemoresistant hypothesis. Unfortunately the analysis is underpowered and confounded by other  factors  such  as  the  extent  of  disease  upon  initiation  of  treatment  and  how  this  relates  to treatment failure. Therefore, no conclusion can be drawn from the provided analysis.
