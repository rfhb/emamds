## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for onasemnogene abeparvovec, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In  view  of  available  data  on  'infusion-related  reactions  including  anaphylactic  reactions'  and  'cardiac adverse events' from clinical studies, the literature, and spontaneous reports the PRAC concluded that the  product  information  of  products  containing  onasemnogene  abeparvovec  should  be  amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for onasemnogene abeparvovec the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing onasemnogene abeparvovec is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
