## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an illness characterised by air flow limitation that is not fully reversible. It is usually progressive and is associated with pathological changes in the lung - a combination, varying between individual patients, of obstructive bronchiolitis and parenchymal destruction (emphysema). The most widely accepted classification of the severity of COPD is according to The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). The GOLD classification is based on the degree of impairment of lung function. Four categories are recognised: mild, moderate, severe, very severe (Stages I-IV).

The prevalence of COPD in the population is difficult to estimate, but it is a major public health problem and currently the fourth leading cause of chronic morbidity and mortality. Mortality due to COPD is again difficult to estimate, but it appears to be increasing. It is estimated that by 2020, COPD will be the third leading cause of global mortality (GOLD 2009).

The  aims  of  pharmacological  treatment  in  COPD,  as  described  in  the  GOLD  guideline  are  to prevent  and  control  symptoms,  to  reduce  the  frequency  and  severity  of  exacerbations,  to improve  health  status,  and  to  improve  exercise  tolerance.  GOLD  guidelines  recognize  that bronchodilators (by reducing airflow limitation) are central to the management of symptoms in COPD and recommend regular use of long-acting bronchodilators for patients with moderate to severe COPD. Within the class of long-acting bronchodilators, long-acting β2 agonists (LABAs) and long-acting antimuscarinic (LAMAs) are available. There are several marketed LABAs such as formoterol, salmeterol, and indacaterol and for the group of LAMAs tiotropium, glycopyrronium bromide and aclidinium bromide are currently available. LABAs and LAMAs as single-agent are recommended first-line treatments in moderate to severe COPD. Combination

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment  with  LABA  and  LAMA  is  recommended  as  option  by  the  2013  version  of  the  GOLD COPD guidelines when symptoms are not improved with single agent in patients classified as group B (low risk, more symptoms). Similarly, the combination of a LABA and a LAMA in addition to an inhaled corticosteroid is recommended as alternative to a single-agent LABA or LAMA plus an inhaled corticosteroid in patients classified as group C (high risk, less symptoms). The GOLD 2013 states that 'Both long-acting anticholinergic and long-acting beta 2 agonists reduce the risk  of  exacerbations,  and  although  good  long-term  studies  are  lacking,  the  principle  of combination treatment seems sound' (GOLD 2013).

Ulunar  Breezhaler  (also  referred  to  as  QVA149)  is  a  fixed-dose  combination  of  indacaterol maleate (QAB149) and glycopyrronium bromide (NVA237) (ATC code: R03AL04; Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Adrenergics in combination with anticholinergic) intended as a oncedaily  maintenance  bronchodilator  treatment  to  relieve  symptoms  and  reduce  exacerbations  in patients with COPD.

QAB149 (indacaterol maleate) is a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA). When inhaled, indacaterol acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator.

NVA237  (glycopyrronium  bromide)  is  a  long  acting  muscarinic  receptor  antagonist  (LAMA). Glycopyrronium  works  by  blocking  the  bronchoconstrictor  action  of  acetylcholine  on  airway smooth muscle cells, thereby dilating the airways.

Ulunar Breezhaler is to be administered once daily (o.d.) as a capsule via a low resistance single dose dry powder inhaler (SDDPI) also referred to as Concept1 or Breezhaler.

Ulunar  Breezhaler  is  a  duplicate  application  to  the  marketing  authorisation  (MA)  of  Ultibro Breezhaler (EU/1/13/862/001-006) approved in the EU on 19 September 2013. Another duplicate of  Ultibro  Breezhaler,  Xoterna  Breezhaler  (EU/1/13/863/001-006),  was  approved  at  the  same time as Ultibro Breezhaler.

The application is submitted in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and is regarded to have  automatic  access  for  substances  already  authorised  via  Centralised  Procedure.  Eligibility based on automatic access was confirmed by the CHMP on 24 October 2013.

The  legal  basis  of  this  application  is  Article  10c  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  Informed  consent application  and  accordingly  a  complete  Module  1  is  submitted.  A  letter  of  consent  dated  on  8 November 2013 from the MAH of Ultibro Breezhaler, which was submitted as a full application under Art 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, has been allowing access to Module 2 to Module  5  of  the  initial  dossier  of  this  authorised  product  and  any  subsequent  post-marketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved. The Applicant (Novartis Europharm Ltd.) is the marketing authorisation holder of the cross-referred medicinal product Ultibro Breezhaler.

As  a  consequence,  quality,  safety  and  efficacy  of  the  Ulunar  Breezhaler  medicinal  product  are identical to the up-to-date quality, safety and efficacy profile of Ultibro Breezhaler. Information on the scientific discussions can be found in the Ultibro Breezhaler CHMP assessment report and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).

The  PI  is  identical  to  that  of  Ultibro  Breezhaler  PI  except  for  the  administrative  information related to Ulunar Breezhaler-specific information.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

The present submission is an informed consent application. No additional quality data have been submitted in connection with this application. The manufactures of Ulunar Breezhaler are the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

same as for the currently approved Ultibro Breezhaler. Satisfactory GMP certificates have been provided.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

No non-clinical data have been submitted in the Ulunar Breezhaler dossier, since this application is an informed consent of the Ultibro Breezhaler application: the non-clinical data in support of the Ulunar Breezhaler application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Ultibro Breezhaler dossier, which have been assessed and approved.

## 2.4. Environmental risk assessment

An environmental Risk Assessment has been provided, which is identical to the one that was submitted for Ultibro Breezhaler.

Ulunar Breezhaler is submitted as an informed consent application intended to be administered at the same dose levels as Ultibro Breezhaler and for the same indication as already approved in the EU. Based on the assumption that the product is to be substituted for the identical product Ultibro Breezhaler or the already approved copy Xoterna Breezhaler the total amount of drug substance released into the environment has not changed.

## 2.5. Clinical aspects

No new clinical data has been provided within this application. The clinical data in support of the Ulunar Breezhaler application is identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Ultibro Breezhaler dossier which have already been assessed and approved by the CHMP.

## 2.6. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.

## 2.7. Risk Management Plan

Category 2 are specific obligations

Category 3 are required additional PhV activity (to address specific safety concerns or to measure effectiveness of risk minimisation measures)

The CHMP confirmed that no changes are needed for this Risk Management Plan of Ulunar Breezhaler.

## 2.8. User consultation

A  justification  for  not  performing  a  full  user  consultation  with  target  patient  groups  on  the package  leaflet  has  been  submitted  by  the  applicant  and  has  been  found  acceptable  for  the following reasons:

The  Applicant  provided  the  report  on  the  results  from  the  user  consultation  done  for  Ultibro Breezhaler. The CHMP considered it acceptable to refer to the user consultation done for Ultibro Breezhaler  as  the  package  leaflet  is  identical  and  no  separate  user  testing  for  this  informed consent application is considered necessary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Final overall conclusion and risk benefit assessment

The  application  has  been  submitted  in  accordance  with  Article  10c  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  as amended (Informed consent Application) under automatic access to the centralised procedure.

Ulunar Breezhaler is identical to Ultibro Breezhaler previously approved by the CHMP. The quality, non-clinical, efficacy and safety data for Ulunar Breezhaler is therefore considered satisfactorily and the benefit-risk profile for Ulunar Breezhaler is positive.
