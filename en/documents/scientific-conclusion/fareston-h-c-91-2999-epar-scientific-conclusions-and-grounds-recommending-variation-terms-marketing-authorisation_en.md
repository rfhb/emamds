## Scientific conclusions

Based on the review of the cumulative data and literature review submitted in this PSUR procedure, the PRAC considers it necessary to update the Product Information of Fareston and include events of thrombocytopenia, anaemia and leukopenia in section 4.8 of the SmPC ('Undesirable effects') with frequency 'unknown'.

In  addition,  in  section  4.4  'Precaution  for  use',  the  statement  that  anaemia,  leukopenia  and thrombocytopenia  have  been  reported;  red  blood  cell,  leukocyte  or  platelet  counts  should  be monitored when using FARESTON is to be added. The PL is to be modified accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for TOREMIFENE the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance TOREMIFENE is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.
