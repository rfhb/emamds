## 1. INTRODUCTION

On  12  December  2008,  the  MAH  submitted  2  paediatric  studies  to  document  use  of  intravenous Revatio in children, in accordance with Article 45 of the Regulation (EC)No 1901/2006, as amended on medicinal  products  for  paediatric  use. The  applicant  did  not  propose  any  claims  based  on  this submitted study . At  the time of submission no medicinal product was approved for PAH for use in a paediatric population, though bosentan SPC contained some paediatric PK data in section 4.2 to guide dosing.  Revatio IV was also not registered for adults at that time.

## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1. Clinical aspects

The MAH submitted reports for:

-  A1481134;  a  randomized,  multicenter,  double-blind,  placebo-controlle,  dose-ranging,  parallel group  study  of  intravenous  sildenafil  in  the  treatment  of  children,  aged  0-17  with  pulmonary hypertension after corrective cardiac surgery.
-  A1481157; a 7-day, open-label, multicenter, pharmacokinetic study (part 1) followed by a 7-day, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, parallel group study (part 2)  of  IV  sildenafil  in  the  treatment  of  neonates  with  persistent  pulmonary  hypertension  of  the newborn (PPHN) or hypoxic respiratory failure and at risk for PPHN.

## Clinical study(ies)

A  randomised,  multicenter,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  dose  ranging,  parallel  group  study  of intravenous  sildenafil  in  the  treatment  of  children,  aged  0  to  17  with  pulmonary  hypertension  after corrective cardiac surgery, A1481134.

## Methods

-  Objective(s)

## Primary:

To  assess  the  efficacy  of  intravenous  (IV)  sildenafil,  over  24  hours  of  treatment,  on  pulmonary hypertension during the post-operative period in children aged 0 (GLYPH&lt;31&gt;34 weeks gestational age) to 17 years with congenital heart disease who have undergone corrective cardiac surgery.

## Secondary:

To assess the safety and tolerability of IV sildenafil in children with corrected congenital heart disease with pulmonary hypertension,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To  establish  an  effective  dose  range  of  IV  sildenafil  in  the  treatment  of  pulmonary  hypertension  in children following corrective cardiac surgery

To investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK)-effect relationship, to determine the population PK parameters and

To  evaluate  the  healthcare  resource  utilisation  associated  with  the  use  of  sildenafil  compared  to alternate therapies.

##  Study design

Randomisation of subjects was to be stratified by age (neonate or non-neonate) and by study centre. They were to be randomized 63 patients per group, however only 18 patients were randomized.

##  Study population /Sample size

Eighteen  male  or  female  subjects  aged  0  (&gt;34  weeks  gestational  age)  to  17  years  (up  to  one  day before 18th birthday). Subjects undergoing corrective cardiac surgery (2 ventricle repair), for at least one of the lesions or procedures specified in the protocol and subjects who had a clinical diagnosis of post-operative pulmonary hypertension and a systolic pulmonary artery pressure &gt;50% of the systolic arterial blood pressure (&gt;75% for neonates GLYPH&lt;31&gt;28 days) confirmed by qualifying Doppler echocardiogram or pulmonary artery (PA) catheter.

##  Treatments

Three  intravenous  sildenafil  dosage  regimens  were  selected  to  achieve  target  sildenafil  plasma concentrations of approximately 40, 120, and 360 ng/mL, respectively, for the three dosage regimens. Each regimen consisted of a bolus loading dose infused over five minutes, followed by a maintenance infusion for 24 to 72 hours, the infusion of study drug continued for a minimum of 24 and maximum of 72 hours.

##  Outcomes/endpoints

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  efficacy  evaluations  included:  receipt  of  additional  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  post-operative complication of pulmonary hypertension within 24 hours of the start of study drug infusion. Time to first  extubation,  length  of  hospital  stay,  length  of  stay  in  intensive  care  unit,  total  duration  of administration  of  additional  therapy  for  pulmonary  hypertension  and  deaths  assessed  up  to  28-day follow-up.  Change  from  baseline  in  post-operative  inotrope  scores,  change  from  baseline  in  serum lactate levels (as a surrogate for cardiac output evaluation) and change from baseline in haemodynamic parameters at post-baseline assessment times. Plasma concentration data for sildenafil and its metabolite (UK-103,320) was obtained from all subjects in this study.

##  Statistical Methods

As the study was terminated early, the statistical analysis plan was amended prior to unblinding the study and the efficacy data were listed. The applicant did a post-hoc analysis.

## Results

##  Recruitment/ Number analysed

This  study  was  stopped  due  to  low  enrolment  because  of  the  rarity  of  clinically  significant  postoperative pulmonary hypertension associated with current treatment practices.

If any conclusion on primary endpoint and secondary endpoints can be drawn, these should be handled with care due to the small number of patients. A conclusion on the benefit risk ratio is difficult to draw. No dose advice can be drawn based on the presented data. Furthermore, the patient group except for two, is limited to patients &lt;2  years. As long as the applicant does not make  any  dose recommendations or proposes claims, a specific conclusion is difficult  to  draw.  Therefore,  a  definite benefit risk evaluation for a specific dose-advice cannot be made.

A  7-day,  open-label,  multicenter,  pharmacokinetic  study  (part  1)  followed  by  a  7-day,  randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled, dose-ranging, parallel group study (part 2) of iv sildenafil in the treatment of neonates with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (pphn) or hypoxic respiratory failure and at risk for PPHN, A1481157

## Methods

-  Objective(s)

The primary objective for Part 1 of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of intravenous (IV) sildenafil in near term and term newborns with PPHN or with hypoxic respiratory failure and at risk for PPHN.

The  secondary  objectives  for  Part  1  of  the  study  were:  to  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  IV sildenafil,  and  to  characterise  the  pharmacokinetics  of  sildenafil  in  newborns  with  PPHN  or  hypoxic respiratory failure and at risk of developing PPHN.

-  Study design

The study comprised three phases; a screening phase up to 72 hours of age, a treatment phase during which subjects received study drug for at least 48 hours and for up to seven days [168 hours (inclusive of times off study drug infusion)] with or without the addition of standard treatment, and a follow-up phase which consisted of two visits; one conducted at seven ± three days after the final termination of study treatment or at the time of hospital discharge, whichever came first, and the other on Day 28 ± three days. For the purpose of this study, standard treatment was inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygen (ECMO).

-  Study population /Sample size

Male or female subjects, ≤ 72  hours of age and ≥ 34  weeks gestational age, with PPHN or hypoxic respiratory  failure  associated  with:  idiopathic  PPHN,  meconium  aspiration  syndrome,  respiratory distress  syndrome,  sepsis,  and/or  pneumonia.  They  also  had  to  have  an  OI ≥ 15  on  two  separate occasions, calculated using arterial blood gas taken at least 30 minutes apart.

-  Treatments

The loading dose infusion was extended to 30 minutes. For subjects in Group 7, no loading dose was administered and for subjects in Group 8 the duration of the loading dose was extended to 3 hours (180 minutes). Following the loading dose infusion, a maintenance dose infusion was administered at a constant infusion rate. This continued for at least 48 hours, and for up to seven days

The  dose  for  the  first  treatment  group  was  targeted  to  produce  a  plasma  concentration  of approximately 40ng/ml. Doses were escalated for subsequent treatment groups.

-  Outcomes/endpoints

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Blood  samples  for  pharmacokinetic  assay  were  collected  at:  5  and  30  minutes  after  the  end  of  the loading dose infusion, every 24 hours from the start of the study drug infusion, just prior to the end of the  study  drug  infusion  and  at  1,  4,  8,  12,  24,  48,  and  72  hours  after  the  end  of  the  study  drug infusion.

In Group 7, blood samples for pharmacokinetic assay were collected at 6 and 12 hours after the start of study drug infusion As the duration of the loading dose in Group 8 was 3 hours, blood samples for pharmacokinetic  assay  were  collected  at  30  minutes  after  the  start  of  study  drug  infusion  and  just before the loading dose was completed.

##  Statistical Methods

No hypothesis testing was performed. The population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using the Nonlinear Mixed Effects Modelling software.

Mixed-effects pharmacokinetic models  were  used  to simultaneously describe the natural logtransformed plasma concentration-time data for sildenafil and UK-103,320. Since biotransformation to UK-103,320 is the primary route of elimination of sildenafil in adults, it was assumed for purposes of model development, that sildenafil was completely metabolised to UK-103,320 in neonates. One- and two-compartmental  pharmacokinetic  models,  parameterised  in  terms  of  sildenafil  clearance  (Clpar), central volume of distribution of sildenafil (V1par), inter-compartmental clearance of sildenafil (Qpar), peripheral volume of distribution of sildenafil (V2par), UK-103,320 clearance (Clmet), central volume of  distribution  of  UK-103,320  (V1met),  inter-compartmental  clearance  of  UK-103,320  (Qmet),  and peripheral  volume  of  distribution  of  UK-103,320  (V2met)  were  evaluated,  in  order  to  select  a  base pharmacokinetic model. Covariates such as body weight, age, gender, and concomitant administration of  other  CYP3A4  substrates  were  included  in  the  base  model  to  form  the  full  model.  The  Wald's approximation method procedure was applied to the full model to identify the final covariate model. Model selection and covariate inclusion was based on the change in the minimum objective function value, evaluation of model diagnostic plots, and clinical significance of the covariate effect.

One subject died during the study. This child died from a combination of her underlying illnesses of meconium aspiration, birth asphyxia and pulmonary hypertension which was further complicated by tension pneumothorax. Four subjects reported treatment emergent serious adverse events; one had hypotension, one had anomalous pulmonary venous connection, and two had a pneumothorax. None of these events were considered to be treatment related.

Four subjects discontinued study treatment due to treatment emergent adverse events; one due to hypotension,  two  due  to  labile  blood  pressure,  and  one  due  to  anomalous  pulmonary  venous connection,  also  reported  as  a  serious  adverse  event.  One  case  of  labile  blood  pressure  and  the hypotension were considered to be caused by the study drug.

The conclusion drawn by applicant on this study were:

## CHMP  comments:

The relatively long duration of a sildenafil infusion started soon after birth, allowed characterisation of the  maturation  of  sildenafil  clearance  in  neonates  during  the  early  post-natal  period,  and  was consistent with previous reports of the rapid maturation of CYP3A4 during this period of life.

Sildenafil pharmacokinetics in neonates with PPHN was characterised by high inter-individual variability and moderately high residual variability. The inability to detect significant covariates, other than age, may be related to the small number of subjects in the study and the high variability. Therefore, other covariate effects on sildenafil and UK-103,320 pharmacokinetics could not be ruled out.

Sildenafil clearance in neonates at 10 days of age was predicted to be similar to that in adults after adjustment  for  body  weight.  Routine  dose  adjustment  to  account  for  the  expected  decrease  in concentrations  during  a  continuous  sildenafil  infusion  may  not  be  necessary,  given  the  expected margin  of  safety  and  tolerability  of  sildenafil  and  the  high  inter-individual  variability  in  sildenafil pharmacokinetics.  An  increase  in  dose  during  the  infusion  may  be  considered  if  warranted  by  the subject's  clinical  response.  High  inter-individual  variability  was  observed  in  the  pharmacokinetics  of sildenafil and UK-103,320 in neonates.

Inter-individual  variability  in  the  pharmacokinetics  of  sedative  drugs  used  commonly  in  similar neonatal  populations  in  intensive  care  settings  have  been  reported  to  be  high,  and  may  be  partly related  to  the  variable  disease  states  of  the  critically  ill  neonates.  Although  sildenafil  doses  may  be initiated  in  neonates  with  PPHN  using  the  mean  pharmacokinetic  parameters  reported  in  this  study, some titration of sildenafil dose to clinical response may be necessary, given the high inter-individual variability  in  pharmacokinetics,  as  well  as  the  lack  of  information  on  sildenafil  efficacy  in  this population. The pharmacokinetic parameters determined in full term neonates with PPHN in this study may not be representative of those in healthy neonates or pre-term neonates.

## Conclusions

The conclusions of the submitted study and the use of the modeling should be interpreted with care due  to  the  small  number  of  subjects  and  the  unknown  development  of  the  metabolic  system responsible for the metabolism of sildenafil in this group of patients. That the clearance of sildenafil in patients 10 days of ages can be used for extrapolation to adults after adjustment of body weight may be coincidence and should be intrepreted with utmost care. This type of modeling may not be very useful  in  predicting  the  pharmacokinetics  in  children  without  incorporating  the  most  important covariate  as  the  maturation,  the  metabolic  systems  responsible  for  the  elimination  of  sildenafil.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Applicant  did  not  make  an  attempt  to  use  adult  data  for  extrapolation  to  the  group  of  children  of different age.

## 3. Overall conclusion and recommendation

## Overall conclusion

The applicant did not propose any claims based on this submitted study A1481134.The used endpoints in the submitted studies are not validated. A conclusion on the benefit risk ratio is difficult to draw. No dose advice can be drawn based on the presented data. Furthermore, the patient group is limited to patients  &lt;2 years. As long as the applicant does not make any dose recommendations or proposes claims,  a  specific  conclusion  is  difficult  to  draw  for  the  assessor.  Therefore,  a  definite  benefit  risk evaluation  for  a  specific  dose-advice  cannot  be  made.  For  study  A1481157,  the  conclusions  of  the submitted study should be interpreted with care mainly due to the small number of subjects.

In summary, information is submitted on the use of intravenous sildenafil in children but no further conclusion can be made due to the limited number of patients, the lack of any claim, in particular on dosing and the fact that Revatio IV itself was not registered for adults at the time of submission. As long as the applicant does not make any claims, there is no need for a further assessment.

## Recommendation

No further action required.
