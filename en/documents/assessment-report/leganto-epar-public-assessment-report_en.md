The legal basis for this application refers to: Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended - relating to informed consent from the marketing authorisation holder Schwarz Pharma Ltd for the authorised medicinal product Neupro (EU/1/05/331/001-055).

2. Scientific discussion 2.1. Introduction This marketing authorisation application for Leganto (rotigotine) has been submitted by Schwarz Pharma Ltd as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. The MAH (Schwarz Pharma Ltd) for Neupro, which was authorised on 15 February 2006, and submitted under Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, provided consent to make use of the pharmaceutical, non-clinical and clinical documentation of the initial dossier of this authorised product and any subsequent post-marketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved. As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Leganto medicinal product are identical to the upto-date  quality,  non-clinical  and  clinical  profile  of  Neupro.  The  application  for  Leganto  concerns  the identical  strengths  and  pack  sizes  to  those  approved  for  Neupro  and  consists  of  only  Module  1. Information on the scientific discussion can be found in the Neupro CHMP assessment reports and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) published on the EMA website. The approved indications are: 'Neupro is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome in adults. Neupro is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of early-stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease as monotherapy (i.e. without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the course of the disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or 'on-off' fluctuations).' 2.2. Quality aspects Since this application is an informed consent of the Neupro application, the quality data in support of the Leganto application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Neupro dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 2.3. Non-clinical aspects Medicinal product no longer authorised

The applicant has referred to the originators current Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) dated 14 October  2009,  which  was  also  provided  in  the  Leganto  dossier.  The  assessment  conclusions  of  the originators ERA can only be accepted for the Leganto application under the premise that the use of Leganto will not result in an increased use of rotigotine.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Neupro application, the clinical data in support of the Leganto application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Neupro dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.5. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements. Risk Management Plan The applicant submitted a risk management plan (version 8.0) identical to that for Neupro. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. User consultation The  Package  Leaflet  for  Neupro  has  been  successfully  user  tested.  For  the  Leganto  application,  a bridging report has been submitted. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable. The proposed Package Leaflet for Leganto is identical to the Package Leaflet for Neupro except for the product-specific information such as the product name  and  the  list of local representatives. Based on the bridging report, the CHMP considered that the requirements concerning the Package Leaflet and the consultation with target patients groups are fulfilled for Leganto. 2.6. Benefit-Risk Balance Since this application has been submitted by Schwarz Pharma Ltd as an informed consent application to Neupro in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of Leganto (1 mg/24 h, 2 mg/24 h, 3 mg/24 h, 4 mg/24 h, 6 mg/24 h and 8 mg/24 h) transdermal patch was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation for the following indications: 'Leganto is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome in adults. Leganto is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of early-stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease as monotherapy (i.e. without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the course of the disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or 'on-off' fluctuations).' 2.7. Recommendation Medicinal product no longer authorised

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Leganto in the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome and Parkinson's disease was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
