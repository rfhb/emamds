## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for nivolumab / relatlimab, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on serositis and pleural effusion from clinical trials and spontaneous reports, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between nivolumab+relatlimab and serositis and/or pleural effusion is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing nivolumab+relatlimab should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for nivolumab / relatlimab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing nivolumab / relatlimab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
