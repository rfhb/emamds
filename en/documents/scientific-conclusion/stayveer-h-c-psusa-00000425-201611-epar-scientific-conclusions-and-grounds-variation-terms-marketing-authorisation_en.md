## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for bosentan, the scientific conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:

A  study  (Srinivas  NR  et  al,  2016)  showed  that  the  exposure  of  tadalafil  was  reduced  by  bosentan. Bosentan (125 mg twice daily), a substrate of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly CYP2C19, reduced tadalafil (40 mg once per day) systemic exposure by 42% and Cmax by 27% following multiple dose co-administration. The efficacy of tadalafil in patients already on bosentan therapy has not been conclusively demonstrated. Tadalafil did not affect the exposure (AUC and Cmax) of bosentan or its metabolites. Therefore, the interaction between tadalafil and bosentan should be mentioned in the bosentan product information.

In  addition,  the  following  interactions  which  could  have  clinical  relevance  and  which  are  already mentioned  in  bosentan  SmPC  should  be  added  to  the  package  leaflet:  warfarin, simvastatin, ketoconazole and sildenafil.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for bosentan the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing bosentan is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
