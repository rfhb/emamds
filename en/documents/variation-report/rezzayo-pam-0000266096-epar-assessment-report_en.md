Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Introduction

On 11 April 2025, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Rezzayo, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview was also provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study MR907-1501 is part of a clinical development programme.

Study  MR907-1501  was  part  of  the  clinical  studies  required  to  comply  with  the  EMA's  Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP), as per the Decision of the EMA dated 3 January 2019 (EMEA-002319-PIP0117). The PIP was subsequently modified on 8 Sep 2021 (EMEA-002319-PIP01-17-M01), 10 Aug 2022 (EMEA-002319-PIP01-17-M02) and 13 Sep 2024 (EMEA-002319-PIP01-17-M03). Enrolment in the study was  halted  early  prior  to  completion  of  full  enrolment  in  Part  1,  due  to  significant  problems  with recruitment.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The dose for Group 1 was 3 mg/kg.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report(s) for:

- study 2, MR907-1501, 'A Phase 1, Multicentre, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of a Single IV Dose of Rezafungin Acetate in Paediatric Subjects from Birth to &lt;18 Years of Age, Receiving Systemic Antifungals as Prophylaxis for Invasive Fungal Infection or to Treat a Suspected or Confirmed Fungal Infection'.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## MR907-1501, Study 2

## Description

Study  MR907-1501  was  a  Phase  1,  multicentre,  open-label  study  to  evaluate  the  PK,  safety,  and tolerability  of  a  single  IV  dose  of  rezafungin  in  paediatric  subjects  from  birth  to  &lt;18  years  of  age, receiving concomitant systemic antifungals as prophylaxis (excluding echinocandins) for IFI or to treat a suspected or confirmed fungal infection.

This PK study was part of the clinical studies required to comply with the EMA's Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP), in accordance with the EMA Decision on the original PIP dated 03 Jan 2019 (EMEA-002319PIP01-17). The PIP was subsequently modified on 08 Sep 2021 (EMEA-002319-PIP01-17-M01), 10 Aug

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2022 (EMEA-002319-PIP01-17-M02), and further revised on 13 Sep 2024 (EMEA-002319-PIP01-17M03).

## Methods

## Study participants

Eligible  participants  were  male  or  female  aged  birth  to  &lt;  18  years  receiving  concomitant  systemic antifungals as prophylaxis (excluding echinocandins) for IFI or to treat a suspected or confirmed fungal infection.

## Treatments

Subjects received a single IV dose of rezafungin as a 2-hour (±5 minutes) IV infusion.

## Objectives

## Primary objective

To evaluate the PK of a single IV dose of rezafungin in paediatric subjects from birth to &lt;18 years, receiving concomitant systemic antifungals as prophylaxis for IFI or to treat a suspected or confirmed fungal infection.

## Secondary Objective

To assess the safety and tolerability of a single IV dose of rezafungin in paediatric subjects from birth to &lt;18 years, receiving concomitant systemic antifungals as prophylaxis for IFI or to treat a suspected or confirmed fungal infection.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary Endpoint

Parts 1 and 2: The following PK parameters will be assessed: Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, CL, Vss, Vz, t1/2 Part 3: Rezafungin plasma concentrations

## Secondary Endpoint

The safety evaluation was based on clinical review of the following parameters:

- Incidence of TEAEs
- Clinical laboratory evaluations (including haematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis)
- Vital signs
- 12-lead ECGs: clinically significant abnormalities
- Physical examination findings

## Sample size

The study aimed to enrol 32 subjects, with a maximum of 40 subjects (10 per age group) to achieve 32 evaluable subjects for primary analysis. Subjects were to be divided into 4 groups based on age:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Group 1 (12 to &lt; 18 years): 8 subjects
- Group 2 (6 to &lt; 12 years): 8 subjects
- Group 3 (2 to &lt; 6 years): 8 subjects
- Group 4 (birth to &lt; 2 years): 8 subjects

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Not applicable as this is an open-label, single-arm study.

## Statistical Methods

In general, continuous data will be summarised by group using descriptive statistics. Categorical data will be summarised by group as the number and percentage of subjects in each category.

## Results

## Participant flow

Two  subjects  were  enrolled.  Both  were  receiving  concomitant  systemic  antifungals  (oral  or  IV)  as prophylaxis for IFI. Both provided informed consent, completed the study and performed all planned study visits. Both were enrolled and included in the analysis.

## Recruitment

Study MR907-1501 (Phase 1 PK) was initiated in 10 sites across 3 countries (UK, Spain and Germany) and started recruiting the first cohort of participants (12 to &lt;18-year-olds) on 11 July 2023.

## Baseline data

Both subjects were included in Group 1 (12 to &lt;18 years):

During the study, rezafungin was administered under the supervision of the investigator and the exact administration times were recorded in the case report form.

## Number analysed

A total of 3 subjects provided informed consent. Of these, 2 subjects were enrolled and included in the analysis.

## Pharmacokinetic Results

Single dose PK parameters of rezafungin were determined in 2 subjects.

## Efficacy results

There were no efficacy results to report for study MR907-1501.

## Discussion on clinical aspects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Preliminary data from the 2 enrolled subjects suggest that rezafungin exhibits a low clearance, a long terminal half-life, and a moderate volume of distribution (Vz and Vss) in subjects aged 12 to &lt; 18 years.

No significant safety concern was identified. The conclusions drawn from this study are limited by the small sample size, which restricts the generalizability of the findings.

## 3. Overall conclusion and recommendation

The MAH reported the findings from paediatric study MR907-1501 (Study 2 in EMEA-002319-PIP01-17M02),  which  was  terminated  on  14  October  2024.  This  study  aimed  to  assess  the  PK,  safety,  and tolerability of rezafungin in subjects from birth to &lt; 18 years of age receiving concomitant systemic antifungal treatment as a standard-of-care as prophylaxis for IFI or to treat a suspected or confirmed fungal infection. However, enrolment in the study was halted early prior to completion of full enrolment in Part 1 of the study due to significant problems with recruitment. Following this, the MAH, complying with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, submitted the results obtained with the two subjects that were included in the study. These data can only be seen as preliminary and no further regulatory action based on them is required.

## - PAM Fulfilled:

No regulatory action required.
