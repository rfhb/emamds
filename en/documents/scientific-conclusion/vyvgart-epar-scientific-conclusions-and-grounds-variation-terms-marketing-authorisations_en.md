## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for efgartigimod alfa, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on anaphylactic reactions consisting of spontaneous reports, including in some cases a close temporal relationship, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between efgartigimod alfa and anaphylactic reaction is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC Rapporteur concluded that the product information of products containing efgartigimod alfa should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for efgartigimod alfa the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing efgartigimod alfa is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
