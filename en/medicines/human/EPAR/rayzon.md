## Overview

On 24 June 2005 the European Commission adopted the decision withdrawing the Marketing Authorisation for the medicinal product for human use Rayzon. This followed the notification by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (Pharmacia Europe EEIG) on 21 June 2005 to voluntarily withdraw the Marketing Authorisation for Rayzon as there are no plans to market this product in the future. Rayzon (parecoxib) was indicated for the short-term treatment of postoperative pain. It should be noted that there is still one Community Marketing Authorisation valid throughout the European Union for medicinal products containing parecoxib, i.e. Dynastat. As a consequence to this decision the European Public Assessment Report for Rayzon has been removed from this website.
