## 1. Introduction

TachoSil (TC-S) is a ready-to-use absorbable medicated sponge, developed for support of haemostasis and tissue sealing. It consists of an equine collagen sponge coated with human Fibrinogen and human Thrombin, which are well-established components of fibrin sealants.

TachoSil  was  granted  a  marketing  authorisation  by  the  European  Commission  on  8  June  2004  for supportive  treatment  in  surgery  for  improvement  of  haemostasis  where  standard  techniques  are insufficient. Its efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in controlled trials.

The initial marketing authorisation application was based on a clinical development programme where haemostatic efficacy and safety of TC-S was demonstrated in two liver resection studies (TC-014-IN and TC-016-IN). The programme also included one trial in lung lobectomy (TC-013-IN), which failed in  the  planned  analyses  to  show  statistically  significant  results  for  air  sealing  due  to  the  absence  of intraoperative  air  leakage  in  an  unexpected  fraction  of  more  than  50%  of  the  included  patients. Subsequently,  one  kidney  resection  trial  (TC-015-IN)  was  submitted  and  assessed  as  part  of  a variation application (EMEA/H/C/000505/II/0006).

Two studies  were  performed  as  post-approval  commitments.  The  first  was  an  observational  cohort study  (TC-018-IN)  to  investigate  the  potential  occurrence  of  post-treatment  adverse  reactions, specifically thromboembolic and immunological events, and drug interactions leading to thromboembolic events or major postoperative rebleeding. The second trial (TC-019-IN) investigated the efficacy and safety of TC-S in liver surgery on paediatric patients between 4 weeks and 6 years of age.  The  reports  of  both  studies  have  been  submitted  during  the  current  variation  application procedure as FUM 011 and FU2 012.3, respectively. Their assessments are ongoing.

With the aim to expand the therapeutic indication of TC-S to include tissue sealing, two additional clinical trials were initiated in lung and cardiovascular surgery, where the intraoperative pathophysiological  situation  required  effective  sealing  of  air  or  blood  leakage.  The  table  below summarises the overall international clinical development programme for TC-S:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In this application, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) proposes to extend the indication as follows:

TachoSil is indicated for supportive treatment in surgery for improvement of haemostasis, to promote tissue sealing, and for suture support in vascular surgery where standard techniques are insufficient (see SPC section 5.1)'.

To support this application, the MAH has completed two additional clinical trials: TC-021-IM (lung study) and TC-023-IM (cardiovascular study). Changes to the indication are proposed in accordance with the Core SPC for Plasma derived Fibrin Sealant/Haemostatic Products (CHMP/BPWG/153/00).

In addition, the MAH proposed to update section 4.4 of the SPC by deleting the warning on the use of TC-S in vascular surgery, having now generated data on the use of TC-S in cardiovascular surgery in Study TC-023-IM. Also, the MAH proposed to update sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC.

## 2. Clinical aspects

Both  studies  supporting  this  variation  application  were  conducted  within  EU  and  according  to principles  of  GCP  and  with  adherence  to  ICH  guidelines.  In  addition,  one  site  in  Switzerland participated in Study TC-021-IM, and met the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.1 Clinical pharmacology

No new clinical pharmacology data was included in this application.

The MAH considered that the tissue sealing and haemostatic properties of fibrinogen based products cannot  be  separated  due  to  the  gluing  and  sealing  effect  of  the  viscous  fibrin  clot  deposited  at  the wound site. The haemostatic efficacy of TC-S thus to some extent mirrors the product's tissue sealing properties. This is reflected in the pharmacodynamic properties described in the SPC of TC-S (SPC, section 5.1). The collagen sponge carrier adds further to the haemostatic and tissue sealing effect by holding the fibrin glue components in place at the wound site, thus avoiding dilution by washing-off, and by providing a mechanical barrier to support the sealing. To reiterate some of non-clinical data from the original submission, TC-S showed good tissue sealing and haemostatic efficacy with strong adhesion  to  the  wound  surface.  Studies  with  experimentally  increased  intra-organ  pressure  are  of special relevance and showed good adhesive and sealing properties of TC-S. One non-clinical study showed good haemostatic efficacy of TC-S under hyper-fibrinolytic conditions. A further study tested the  adhesive  and  sealing  properties  of  TC-S  in  an ex  vivo artificial  lung  model,  mimicking  the application  on  the  visceral  pleura  of  the  lung  for  air  sealing.  TC-S  was  shown  to  withstand  an  air pressure of approximately 65 hPa, which is in the upper range of physiological airway pressures, e.g. during  a  strong  cough.  The  above  investigations  were  designed  to  test  the  tissue  sealing  and haemostatic  efficacy  of  TC-S  (lacking  the  anti-fibrinolytic  aprotinin)  compared  to  the  predecessor product  TachoComb  H  (with  aprotinin).  There  could  be  a  potential  interaction  with  concomitantly used anticoagulants such as heparin. This question has been investigated as part of the post-marketing safety monitoring study (TC-018-IN).

## 2.2 Clinical efficacy

The clinical evidence in support of this variation was derived from two pivotal trials concerning the tissue sealing efficacy and safety of TC-S. The trials were designed to demonstrate tissue sealing from two different surgical settings. The outcome variables of the lung lobectomy trial (study TC-021-IM) reflect directly the pure tissue sealing properties of TC-S, i.e. intra- and postoperative sealing against alveolar  air  leakage,  while  the  endpoints  of  the  cardiovascular  trial  (study  TC-023-IM)  reflect  the ability  of  TC-S  to  establish  a  mechanical  barrier  against  the  high  pressure  of  arterial  bleeding  and induce local haemostasis at the site of application. In addition, the latter trial was intended to generate clinical data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of TC-S as suture support in vascular surgery.

It  is  important  to  stress  that  the  applicant  has  already  conducted  a  trial  with  TC-S  in  pulmonary lobectomy  (TC-013-IN),  in  which  189  subjects  scheduled  for  lobectomy  due  to  lung  cancer  were included. The design of TC-013-IN was essentially identical to that of the TC-021-IM trial, except for the following: (i) Subjects with absence of persistent air leakage (Grade 0) following lobectomy and primary  stapling were included,  and  (ii)  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  presence  of  air  leakage 48 hours  after  surgery.  Unexpectedly,  about  half  of  the  subjects  achieved  Grade  0  air  leakage following the primary stapling, thus eroding the power of the trial. This caused the outcome of the planned analyses of difference in treatment efficacy to be statistically insignificant. The ITT analysis of all subjects in TC-013-IN, regardless of the degree of air leakage at randomisation, showed that air leakage 48 (± 6) hours after surgery (primary efficacy endpoint) was present in 34% for TC-S and 37%  for  standard  treatment  (p=0.76).  The  odds  ratio  (OR)  of  presence  of  air  leakage  with  TC-S compared to standard treatment was 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.48 - 1.72). Assessment of secondary  endpoints  showed  no  significant  differences  between  treatment  groups.  However,  ITT analyses of the sub-population with persistent air leakage after primary stapling (Grades 1 - 2; n=89) indicated efficacy of TC-S (analyses not pre-defined in protocol).

Based on the findings of this trial, the applicant has decided to conduct a second lung trial, which was to include subjects with air leakage Grade 1 and 2, only.

## 2.2.1 Study TC-021-IM and Study TC-023-IM

##  Methods

## Study Participants

In Study TC-021-IM, subjects were eligible for study participation if they had an elective lobectomy for  lung  malignancy with intrapulmonary lymphadenectomy. They were randomized to TachoSil or standard surgical treatment when intraoperative air leakage had been assessed by water submersion test.  Air  leakage  Grade  1  (mild,  countable  bubbles)  and  Grade  2  (moderate,  stream  of  bubbles) qualified  for  inclusion.  Patients  with  air  leakage  Grade  3  (severe,  coalesced  bubbles)  could  be reassessed by submersion test after further stapling or limited suturing. Patients with no air leakage (Grade 0) were not eligible for inclusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In Study TC-023-IM, patients undergoing a planned elective surgery on the heart, the ascending aorta or aortic arch and requiring a cardiopulmonary bypass procedure were included.

## Treatments

TachoSil is a sterile, ready-to-use, absorbable sponge for intra-operative topical application. It consists of an equine collagen sponge coated with the fibrin glue components human fibrinogen (5.5 mg/cm 2 ) and human thrombin (2.0 IU/cm 2 ). The active side is coloured with riboflavin. The sponge size used in both trials was 9.5 x 4.8 x 0.5 cm and could be cut. The sponge(s) had to cover the site(s) at least 1 2 cm beyond the immediate margins. If more than one sponge was used, the individual sponges had to overlap. The sponge(s) should be applied with pressure for 3 min.

## Patients randomized to the control group received (additional) standard treatments.

In the lung study these should be sutures, staples or even no treatment according to the routine at the site. Forty-two (28%) of the 150 standard treatment subjects had no additional standard treatment after randomisation.  During  the  first  round  of  trial  treatment,  suturing  was  used  in  79  subjects  (53%), stapler in 23 (15%) and other standard treatment in 4 subjects (3%).

In the cardiovascular study standard haemostatic treatment should be any haemostatic fleece material without  additional  active  coagulation  stimulating  compounds,  applied  with  pressure  for  3  minutes. Twenty-eight  (49%)  patients  in  the  standard  treatment  group  were  treated  with  compression  and gauze, 24 (42%) with compression and fibrillar absorbable haemostatic fleece, 4 (7%) with suture and 1 (2%) with Tissucol®.

## Objectives

Study  TC-021-IM  compared  the  sealing  efficacy  and  safety  of  TachoSil  versus  standard  surgical treatment  as  secondary  management  of  intra-operative  pulmonary  air  leakage  after  lobectomy  in subjects with lung malignancies with or without metastases.

Study TC-023-IM compared the efficacy and safety of TachoSil in cardiovascular surgery to standard treatment of haemorrhage.

## Outcomes/endpoints

In  study  TC-021-IM,  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  duration  of  post-operative  air  leakage following provocation by coughing; secondary efficacy endpoint was the reduction of intra-operative air leakage intensity after the first application of trial treatment. Descriptive variables were the total number of days until  removal  of  the  (last)  chest  drain  and  predefined  post-operative  complications (pneumonia, pulmonary  embolism,  atelectasis of the lung, surgical wound  infection, cardiac arrhythmia, progression/increase of soft tissue emphysema documented by X-ray, need for additional chest  drainage,  need  for  re-operation,  need  for  respiratory  assistance,  bleeding  and  need  for  blood transfusion).

Primary efficacy endpoint in study TC-023-IM was the proportion of patients achieving haemostasis after 3 minutes and, as secondary efficacy endpoint, haemostasis after 6 minutes. If haemostasis was not achieved after 3 minutes, another piece of trial treatment (TC-S or standard fleece material) was applied for 3 min. If haemostasis was achieved, 'time to haemostasis' was recorded as 6 min. If after 6 min, haemostasis was not achieved, rescue treatment could be initiated. Other endpoints were the incidence  of  re-operation  due  to  bleeding  complications,  post-operative  transfusion,  duration  and volume of drainage.

## Sample size

The  calculation  of  the  sample  size  for  Study  TC-021-IM  was  based  on  experience  from  previous clinical  trias.  In  study  TC-013-IN  subjects  with  intra-operative  air  leakage  grade  &gt;  0  had  a  median duration of post-operative air leakage of 1 day when treated with TachoSil and 2 days when allocated to standard treatment. Based on these data, 10,000 trials were simulated by selecting subjects from the above  mentioned  subpopulation  in  TC-013-IN  using  random  sampling  with  replacement.  Equal number of subjects was chosen from each of the two treatment groups and in each trial the log-rank test performed to assess the difference between treatments. The percentage of trials with the log-rank test  showing  statistical  significance  for α =  5%  was  used  as  power  estimate.  Based  on  these simulations a total sample size of 300 subjects, resulting in a (simulated) power of about 94% was chosen.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For  Study  TC-023-IM,  anticipating  a  75%  responder  rate  (i.e.  patients  with  haemostasis  after  3 minutes) in the TachoSil group vs. 45% responder in the comparator group, a chi-squared test would require 61 patients per group to detect this difference with 90% power (Type I error: 0.05, 2-sided).

## Randomisation

Subjects were randomised to either TachoSil or additional (standard) surgical treatment (TC-021-IM) and standard haemostatic treatment (TC-023-IM) respectively by means of a central Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). After having received specific user (site) identification, trial identification and age of the subject to be randomised, the IVRS informed the investigator of subject number and the trial treatment allocated to the subject. In both trials block randomisation (block length: 10 in trial TC021-IM, 4 in trial TC-023-IM) was applied using a randomisation ratio (TachoSil : comparator) of 1:1.

## Blinding (masking)

Due  to  practical  reasons  (comparison  to  standard  surgical  and  standard  haemostatic  treatment), blinding was not possible. Thus, the studies were performed as open-label studies.

## Statistical methods

For  the efficacy  analyses ,  in  general,  statistical  tests  were  decided  applying α =  5%  (2-sided).  The primary  analysis  in  both  trials  was  performed  for  the  ITT  population  comprising  of  all  patients randomised who were treated, additional analyses were performed on pre-specified PP populations. Continuous  data  were  summarised  by  the  number  of  valid  and  missing  values,  mean,  standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum. Categorical data were summarised by absolute and relative frequencies.

The primary parameter of efficacy in study TC-021-IM, duration of post-operative air leakage was analysed by means of a life table analysis. Since air leakage was recorded at nominal time points, i.e. the  evening  on  the  day  of  surgery,  1st  shift  on  the  day  after  surgery  etc.  the  actual  time  points  of sealing  were  not  observed  but  attributed  to  one  of  the  time  intervals  Day  0 operation -Day 0evening ,  Day 0evening - Day 1 morning , Day 1 morning - Day 1 evening , etc. Subjects that did not obtain absence of air leakage were censored at the day of the last assessment. In case this assessment was missing, post-operative air leakage was censored at the time of the last available assessment. Subjects needing rescue treatment were  censored  at  the  maximum  duration  of  post-operative  air  leakage  (whether  censored  or  not) among  all  other  subjects.  The  Log-rank  test  of  equality  over  treatments  stratified  for  centre  was performed using the life table method.

An  exploratory  parametric  survival  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint,  accounting  for  the  interval censoring, was performed using an accelerated failure time model. The distribution of the observed event times was compared with standard distributions within the framework of accelerated failure time models. A Weibull model with factors treatment and centre was subsequently selected on the basis of log-likelihood tests. In this analysis the actual time points of air leakage assessment were used. The time to sealing was measured from the time point of the last water submersion test.

Sensitivity  analyses,  applying  different  censoring  mechanisms  and/or  policies  to  substitute  missing values were performed for the primary analysis model in order to assess the robustness of the study results.

The  secondary  efficacy  parameter,  reduction  in  intra-operative  air  leakage  intensity  after  the  first application of trial treatment was analysed by means of a Wilcoxon test.

All  other  efficacy  variables  were  summarised  by  means  of  descriptive  statistical  characteristics  as mentioned above.

The primary efficacy endpoint in study TC-023-IM, the proportion of subjects achieving haemostasis at 3 min in the target area was analysed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for centre (data from small centres pooled). Homogeneity of results across (pooled) centres was assessed by means of a Breslow-Day test. The null hypothesis of no treatment was to be rejected in case the CMH test resulted in a p-value &lt; 0.05.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The same method as for the primary endpoint was used to assess the secondary efficacy endpoint, proportion of subjects achieving haemostasis after 6 min. All other efficacy parameters were described by means of statistical characteristics.

For  the Safety  analyses in  both  studies,  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  were  coded  according MedDRA version 10.1 and tabulated stratified by treatment, system organ class (SOC), preferred term (PT),  severity  and  relation.  The  number  of  TachoSil  sponges  used  are  summarised  by  descriptive statistics.  Laboratory  values  from  day  after  surgery  (only  study  TC-021-IM)  and  discharge  were plotted  against  the  values  from  baseline  for  both  treatments.  Changes  in  laboratory  values  from baseline  were  compared  between  treatments  by  means  of  Mann-Whitney  test.  Vital  signs  were summarised by descriptive statistics by treatment and day.

In study TC-021-IM a total of 301 patients were randomized at 12 centres in 8 European countries. The trial took place between January 2006 (first patient in) and March 2007 (last patient out). Of note, an amendment to the protocol (Amendment 1, March 2006) discarded the testing of neo-antigenicity. In study TC-023-IM a total of 120 patients were randomized at 10 centres in 5 European countries. The trial took place between June 2006 (first patient in) and September 2007 (last patient out).

In both trials the primary analyses were performed for the ITT population as outlined in Table 3.

## Baseline data

In  both  trials,  patients  were  well  matched  with  respect  to  their  demographic  and  baseline  data.  The main baseline data for study TC-021-IM and TC-023-IM respectively are as follows:

Thirty  three  percent  (TachoSil)  and  27%  (standard  treatment)  of  patients  had  no  air  leakage  in  the evening  of  the  day  of  surgery.  The  percentage  of  subjects  without  air  leakage  was  higher  in  the TachoSil  group  at  all  selected  time  points.  This  was  supported  by  the  results  of  a  log-rank  test indicating a statistically  significant  (p  =  0.030)  shorter  duration  of  post-operative  air  leakage  in  the TachoSil group compared to standard treatment.

An exploratory parametric analysis using an accelerated failure time model, resulted in an estimated median time until cessation of air leakage of 15.3 h for TachoSil and 20.5 h for standard treatment (p=0.150).

A sensitivity analysis supports the trend in favour of TachoSil as seen in the primary analysis: when assigning the longest post-operative duration of air leakage recorded to censored observations in the TachoSil group the analysis just failed to reach statistical significance (p=0.051). To assess the impact of  the  use  of  Heimlich  valves  on  the  primary  endpoint,  subjects  treated  with  Heimlich  valves  were consequently assigned the longest observed post-operative duration of air leakage across all subjects (20 days). This analysis resulted in a statistically significant difference in favour of TachoSil treatment (p=0.032). Also the log-rank test performed on the PP population provided statistical evidence of a shorter duration of post-operative air leakage in the TachoSil group (p=0.006).

## Study TC-023-IM primary endpoints results

Haemostasis within 3 minutes was reached in 44/59 (74.6%) patients in the TachoSil group compared to 20/60 (33.3%) patients following standard treatment. This difference was statistically significant (p &lt;  0.001,  CMH-test).  When  analysing  the  PP  population,  similar  results  were  observed  (TachoSil: 44/59 (74.6%), standard treatment: 18/52 (34.6%), p &lt; 0.001).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  secondary  efficacy  parameter,  reduction  of  intra-operative  air  leakage  intensity,  revealed  an advantage for TachoSil. 105/147 (71%) of patients treated with TachoSil achieved reduction of at least one grade compared to 90/145 (62%) patients in the standard group (p = 0.04).

Minor  advantages  for  TachoSil  were  found  in  the  mean  number  of  days  until  chest  drain  removal (4.9 days TachoSil; 5.5 days standard) and days until discharge (9.3 TachoSil; 9.7 Standard)

## Study TC-023-IM Ancillary analyses

Haemostasis  after  6  minutes  was  achieved  in  56/59  (95%)  patients  treated  with  TachoSil  and  in 43/60 (72%) patients in the standard group (p &lt; 0.001). In the subgroup of patients with trial treatment before  protamine  infusion  the  proportion  with  haemostasis  at  3  minutes  was  in  favour  of  TachoSil (7/10 vs. 5/9, n.s.) however for haemostasis at 6 minutes no difference was seen (9/10 vs. 8/9). For patients with trial treatment during or after protamine the proportion with haemostasis at 3 minutes was 80% (TachoSil) vs. 32% (Standard, p &lt; 0.001). For haemostasis at 6 minutes there was also an advantage  for  TachoSil  (98%  vs.  75%,  p  &lt;  0.001).  Median  duration  of  drainage  was  comparable between  the  TachoSil  group  (46  days)  compared  to  standard  treatment  (44  days).  Volume  of  postoperative  drainage  was  slightly  higher  following  TachoSil  (median:  600  ml)  than  for  standard treatment (median: 498 ml).

In a substantial proportion of patients, trial treatment was applied after surgical procedures on vessels (aorta,  coronary  anastomosis  or  pulmonary  artery).  An  exploratory  analysis  (not  pre-specified)  was made  of  the  efficacy  of  trial  treatment  in  this  subgroup,  according  to  the  defined  target  area  of bleeding. The results are presented in Table 11, comparing the application on vessels with application on heart tissue (left/right atrium or ventricle) in ITT population.

In the TachoSil group, 17 (27%) subjects had 24 intra-operative transfusions compared to 21 (37%) subjects with 25 transfusions in the control group. Post-operatively, 26 (42%) patients with TachoSil had 51 transfusions and 22 (39%) patients with standard treatment had 44 transfusions. Three (5%) TachoSil  and  17  (28%)  standard  treatment  subjects  were  treatment  failures  and  received  rescue treatment.  The  mean  duration  of  stay  in  hospital  was  11.4  and  13.8  days  for  TachoSil  and  control subjects, respectively. Mean duration of drainage was 93 h in TachoSil subjects and 67 h in controls with a mean volume of post-operative drainage of 1,005 ml and 932 ml, respectively. Re-operation was performed in 3 TachoSil subjects (5%) and 8 standard treatment subjects (14%). The reasons for re-operation  were  not  related  to  the  trial  treatment  and  or  target  area.  In  total,  27  (44%)  TachoSil subjects and 31 (54%) standard treatment subjects had other post-operative complications.

## 2.2.2 Discussion on clinical efficacy

Two clinical studies were submitted to support the extension of the indication to include tissue sealing and suture support in vascular surgery: study TC-021-IM in lung lobectomy surgery and study TC023-IM  in  cardiovascular  surgery.  In  both  studies,  the  selection  of  the  trial  population  and  the inclusion/exclusion  criteria  were  appropriate.  Patients  were  well  matched  with  respect  to  their demographic  and  baseline  data  and  also  with  regard  to  the  surgical  procedures.  The  choice  of endpoints  was  acceptable  as  well  as the sample  size  calculation  and  the  methods  used  for randomisation.  Due  to  practical  reasons  (comparison  to  standard  surgical  and  standard  haemostatic treatment), blinding was not possible, also with respect to assessing the primary endpoint in both trials. Thus, an assessment bias cannot be completely ruled out.

In Study TC-023-IM in elective surgery on the heart, the ascending aorta or the aortic arch. TachoSil was  shown  to  be  superior  to  haemostatic  fleece  material  without  additional  active  coagulation stimulating compounds. Three minutes after application, 74.6% of patients had achieved haemostasis compared to 33.3% after standard treatment. A significant difference with respect to  the  secondary endpoint  (proportion  of  patients  with  haemostasis  after  6  minutes)  has  also  been  found.  Clinical efficacy has clearly been demonstrated.

In lung surgery (study TC-021-IM) the percentage of patients without air leakage was higher in the TachoSil group at all time points compared to standard treatment, resulting in a statistically significant difference for the duration of post-operative air leakage. The estimated median time until cessation of air  leakage  was  15.3 h  for  TachoSil  and  20.5  h  for  standard  treatment.  However,  the  results  of  the primary  efficacy  endpoint  analysis  of  TC-021-IM  study  were  not  considered  to  be  robust.  The statistical significance of the efficacy comparison in the ITT population is of a borderline significance. No  estimated  treatment  difference  was  available  thereby  preventing  any  assessment  of  the  clinical relevance of the difference in duration.  In contrast to the ITT analysis, the PP population (performed by excluding 26 patients) revealed a much lower p-value indicating a statistically significant shorter duration of air leakage. The characteristics of 26 patients removed from the ITT analysis indicate that the  air  leakage  duration  was  similar  between  excluded  patients.  In  addition  a  critical  post-hoc sensitivity analysis excluding two rescue treatment patients resulted in a significant improvement of the  statistical  difference  of  results  between  ITT  and  PP  analyses  in  favour  of  TachoSil  thereby indicating that the presence of the rescue treatment has penalized an air leakage duration estimates. Therefore  it  was  viewed  that  an  original  ITT  analysis  of  the  TC-021-IM  study  was  sufficiently conservative.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Whether the gain of an additional 5.2 hours (median) in relation to an earlier cessation of air leakage is clinically meaningful, is difficult to assess. In the median, the chest drain was removed on day 4 in the TachoSil group and on day 5 in the control group. It is acknowledged that the time of removal of the drain does not exclusively depend on the cessation of air leakage but also on the production of drain fluid and routine procedures on the hospitals' wards.

The analysis of the secondary endpoint (intra-operative air leakage) supports the results of the primary endpoint  (post-operative  air  leakage)  in  favour  of  TachoSil.  Seventy-one  percent  (71%)  of  patients achieved a reduction of intra-operative air leakage of 1-2 grades by application of TachoSil compared with  62%  in  the  standard  treatment  group.  Kind  and  number  of  post-operative  complications  or additional procedures were roughly comparable for the two treatment groups, as well as the number of blood transfusions and the days spent at hospital. However, results of the secondary endpoint analysis are considered to be of a borderline significance.

Overall, superiority of TachoSil over standard treatment has formally been shown in both studies, i.e. in  lung  and  in  cardiovascular  surgery.  Patients  treated  with  TachoSil  had  a  shorter  duration  of  air leakage or a faster haemostasis, respectively, than patients with standard treatment.

## 2.3.1 Study TC-021-IM and Study TC-023-IM

##  Patient exposure

In the context of studies TC-021-IM and TC-023-IM, a total number of 211 patients was exposed to TachoSil,  a  further  207  patients  to  standard  treatment.  Patients  had  a  follow-up  of  1  month  (+/10 days).

##  Adverse events

## Study TC-021-IM

A total of 270 AEs were reported during the trial period; 137 events in 66 (44%) TachoSil subjects and 133  events  in  66  (44%)  standard  treatment  subjects.  Of  these  events,  severity  was  mild  for 198 (91 after   TachoSil/107 after standard treatment), moderate for 54 (37/17) and severe for 18 (9/9) of the AEs.

## Study TC-023-IM

A  total  of  328  AEs  were  reported;  149  events  in  46  (74%)  TachoSil  subjects  and  17  events  in 44 (77%) standard treatment subjects. Of these AEs, severity was mild for 135 (70 after TachoSil/65 after standard), moderate for 151 (64/87) and severe for 42 (15/27) of the AEs. One AE was considered possibly related to trial medication: pyrexia after TachoSil, which was non-serious and of mild severity. No AEs were classified as probably related to treatment.

E=Numberofseriousadverseeventsreported;n=NumberofpatientswithSAE

Of the 32 SAEs, the severity was mild for 10 (4/6), moderate for 7 (6/1) and severe for 15 events (9/6). Causality  possible was  given  to  three  SAEs  in  three  TachoSil  subjects:  drug  ineffective  (severe), pleural effusion and pneumothorax. However, in all three patients, there was an alternative aetiology for  development  of  the  event  (lung  cancer  and  lobectomy  in  the  case  of  pleural  effusion  and  in pneumothorax; incorrect application of the TC-S sponges in the case of drug ineffective).

In Study  TC-023-IM ,  58  SAEs  were  reported:  15  events  in  8  TachoSil  subjects  and  43  events  in 18 standard treatment subjects. Thirteen events occurred in more than one subject: atrial fibrillation (in 1  TachoSil/4  standard  treatment  subjects);  AV  block  third  degree  (0/4);  multiorgan  failure  (2/1); wound infection (2/0); cardiac tamponade (1/1); renal failure acute (1/1); tubulointerstitial  nephritis (1/1);low  cardiac  output  syndrome  (0/2);  myocardial  infarction  (0/2);  ventricular  tachycardia  (0/2); sepsis  (0/2);  pleural  effusion  (0/2);  pneumothorax  (0/2).  Of  the  58  SAEs,  the  severity  was  mild  for seven (2/5), moderate for 22 (7/15) and severe for 29 (6/23). No SAEs of this trial were considered possibly or probably related to treatment with TachoSil or standard treatment.

E=Numberofseriousadverseeventsreported;n=NumberofpatientswithSAE

In  TC-021-IM,  four  subjects  died:  three  TachoSil  subjects  (due  to  candida  sepsis  plus  atelectasis;

cerebrovascular accident (this subject died approx. 1 month after the 1-month follow-up); pneumonia aspiration plus bronchial fistula) and one standard treatment subject (due to bronchopleural fistula). In  TC-023-IM, four subjects died: two TachoSil subjects (both died due to sepsis with multi-organ failure)  and  two  standard treatment subjects (one due to sepsis with multi-organ failure; one due to ventricular tachycardia, myocardial infarction and respiratory failure).

No death was considered related to trial treatment. All deaths were related to the underlying illness or to complications of surgery.

-  Laboratory findings The results of laboratory findings in both trials indicate no abnormalities which could be related to use of TC-S. No statistically significant differences between TachoSil and standard treatments were seen.
-  Vital Signs / Physical Examination Findings were appropriate for the severity of operations in patients for both trials.
-  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

In  study  TC-023-IM,  most  of  the  trial  treatments  were  applied  after  reversal  of  heparinisation  with protamine  infusion.  However,  a  subgroup  of  19  subjects,  10  TachoSil  and  9  standard  treatment subjects, received the trial treatment before protamine infusion and interestingly 70% of the TachoSil subjects had haemostasis at 3 min. Standard treatment was less effective (56%) in this setting.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Discontinuation due to AES

In  total,  five  subjects  were  withdrawn  due  to  AEs.  In  study  TC-021-IM  this  was  one  patient  with candida sepsis and another patient with cerebrovascular accident, both in the TachoSil group, and in study TC-023-IM, two patients in the TachoSil group and one in the standard treatment group (all due to multi-organ failure).

## 2.3.2 Post marketing experience

TC-S  has  been  marketed  in  most  EU  member  states  since  2004.  Up  to  June  2008  more  than 830,000 sponges have been sold. Assuming  an average use of two sponges per procedure approximately  415,000  patients  have  been  exposed  to  TC-S  in  the  period.  No  new  safety  concerns have been identified, and no changes of the product labelling for safety reasons have been considered necessary.

During the evaluation of this extension of indication application, the MAH submitted the results of the Post-Authorisation  Safety  Surveillance  study  TC-018-IN  (Follow-up  measure  FUM  011).  This prospective real patient safety monitoring study was initiated post marketing to allow the monitoring of thrombotic events, immunological reactions and potential interactions. The objective was to obtain systematic  safety  information  on  all  patients  where  TachoSil  is  used  for  haemostasis  in  patient undergoing surgery. From the results reported there is no evidence that TachoSil causes thromboembolic events, immunological events or major bleeding, neither by itself, nor through drug interactions. (CHMP conclusions adopted on 25 September 2008).

## 2.3.3 Discussion on clinical safety

Clinical safety was assessed from the two clinical trials submitted with the variation application. The study population and the exposure to treatment were deemed appropriate and representative for the kind of surgery under investigation. Pyrexia occurred with a slightly higher incidence in the TachoSil treatment groups. Information regarding pyrexia remains in the SPC.

Further to the request from the CHMP in relation to cases of hypersensitivity reactions (pruritus and rash),  the  MAH provided an overall Clinical Expert Statement on the immunogenicity of TachoSil. Even if it cannot be totally excluded that equine collagen-related systemic hypersensitivity reactions may occur during degradation of the sponge, the CHMP agreed that these events could be regarded as single cases and that adequate information is already provided in sections 4.3 (contraindications) and sections 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions for use) of the SPC.

Slightly  higher  incidence  of  atrial  fibrillation  (mainly  reported  by  the  MAH  as  non-serious  AE)  in TachoSil treated patients in the trials in lung lobectomy and cardiovascular patients raised a concern during  the  evaluation  of  this  application.  However,  the  additional  data  provided  by  the  MAH  on patients  with  episodes  of  atrial  fibrillation  indicate  that  there  is  insufficient  evidence  at  present  to suggest a plausible link between TachoSil and atrial fibrillation. Narratives of patients indicate that atrial  fibrillation  events  were  of  transient  nature  and  occurred  in  patients  who  had  baseline  risk  of cardiovascular morbidity. The size of the clinical database of the MAH (inclusive TC-018-IN study) with more than 3600 patients treated with TachoSil is more adequate now to address the concern on thrombotic and cardiac risks and provided data are reassuring.

Overall, results from these two studies did not reveal any new safety concerns. Adverse events were in general comparable between the treatment arms and related to the underlying or concomitant diseases and/or the surgical procedures.

## 3. Risk Management plan (RMP)

The MAH submitted a risk management plan.

The final agreed RMP version 3.0 includes as identified risk thromboembolic events and as potential risks immunological events, transmission of infectious agents, drug-drug interactions, atrial fibrillation, pyrexia and off-label use for sealing indication.

The following Important missing information has been identified in the RMP version 3.0:

-  Specific data has not been  obtained on the use of TachoSil  in neurosurgery  or in gastrointestinal anastomosis.
-  The safety of TachoSil for use in human pregnancy or breastfeeding has not been established in controlled clinical trials.
-  Repeated use of TachoSil.

In isolated cases, these reactions may progress to severe anaphylaxis. Such reactions may especially be seen, if the preparation is applied repeatedly, or administered to patients known to be hypersensitive to constituents of the product. Investigations: Antibodies against components of fibrin sealant products may occur rarely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Transmis-sion of infectious agents | Routine pharmacovigilance | Current approved SmPC: 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma pools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV and HCV and for the non- enveloped virus HAV. The measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19. Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (fetal infection) and for individuals with immunodeficiency or increased erythropoiesis (e.g. haemolytic anaemia). It is strongly recommended that every time that TachoSil is administered to a patient, the name and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the product. |

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  the  results  of  the  Post marketing safety monitoring study (TC-018-IN) is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## 4. Benefit-risk assessment

TachoSil is a ready-to-use absorbable medicated sponge, developed for support of haemostasis and tissue  sealing.  It  consists  of  an  equine  collagen  sponge  coated  with  human  Fibrinogen  and  human Thrombin,  which  are  well-established  components  of  fibrin  sealants.  Tissue  sealing/adhesive  and haemostatic  properties  of  this  product  are  non-separable  and  can  not  be  exerted  without  one  or another.  The  overall  haemostatic  efficacy  of  TachoSil  has  been  demonstrated  by  the  MAH  in  the previous clinical trials in abdominal surgery (liver and kidney resections). However according to the Guideline  on  the  Clinical  Investigation  of  Plasma  Derived  Fibrin  Sealant/Haemostatic  Products (CPMP/BPWG/1089/00), a new clinical study needs to be conducted to support any new indication of the fibrin sealant/haemostatic products.

The  efficacy  evidence  supporting  this  variation  application  was  obtained  by  the  MAH  from  two clinical trials: promotion of tissue sealing was investigated in both trials by applying TachoSil on lung tissue and on heart muscle tissue with endpoints of air and blood leakage, respectively. Additionally, the  efficacy  of  TachoSil  as  suture  support  in  vascular  surgery  was  investigated,  since  68%  of  the patients  in  the  cardiovascular  study  had  surgery  of  vessels.  Both  studies  formally  demonstrated superiority of TachoSil over standard treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  efficacy  evidence  derived  by  the  MAH  from  cardiovascular  surgery  trial  comparing  the haemostatic  efficacy  of  TachoSil  versus  the  standard  treatment  was  robust  and  adequate  enough  to endorse the extension of the indication for suture support in vascular surgery.

Although the evidence derived from lung lobectomy surgery trial is less robust, the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint in this TC-021-IM study is of borderline but statistically significant value. The characteristics of 26 patients removed from the ITT analysis indicate that the air leakage duration was  similar  between  excluded  patients.  In  addition  a  critical  new  post-hoc  sensitivity  analysis excluding  two  rescue  treatment  patients  resulted  in  a  significant  improvement  of  the  statistical difference of results between ITT and PP analyses in favour of TachoSil thereby indicating that the presence  of  the  rescue  treatment  has  penalized  an  air  leakage  duration  estimates.  Therefore,  it  was viewed that an original ITT analysis of the TC-021-IM study was sufficiently conservative.

The  indication  of  tissue  sealing  will  cover  various  types  of  surgery  and  it  is  considered  that  the surgical settings selected by the applicant in the lung surgery were reasonably conservative. The lung surgery study TC-021-IM included patients with lung cancer who potentially had underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore the adhesiveness and withstanding against the air pressure/air leak properties may challenge the effectiveness of TachoSil. Considering that the results of TC-021-IM study are less convincing but still statistically significant, it is  possible  to  expect  that  in  lesser  challenging  surgical  settings  TachoSil  will  produce  more  robust efficacy  in  tissue  sealing  settings.  Based  on  statements  provided  by  two  thoracic  surgeon  experts, TachoSil could be of better use especially in patients with advanced emphysema and fibrosis since the presence of fragile lung tissue makes stapling and clamping techniques limited or impossible.

An  optimal  ratio  between  the  standard  treatment  and  the  TachoSil  application  will  depend  on  the individual patient's needs and the status of lung tissue remodelling. The surgeon can make decision on how  adjunctive/supportive  TachoSil  can  be  in  addition  to  conventional  reinforcing  tissue  sealing techniques  such  as  stapling  and  clamping.  The  difference  in  few  hours  in  relation  to  chest-drain removal between groups although not very convincing, still translates in gain of 1 chest-drain free day.

Clinical advantages of using TachoSil were adequately supported with a number of previous clinical studies. The product has shown a robust and good efficacy in haemostatic support in different surgical settings. A tissue sealing component of TachoSil effect in extra-pulmonary applications was evident from studies conducted in abdominal and cardiovascular surgeries.

Overall, the safety profile of TC-S appears to be good. No major safety concerns derived from these two new studies. Causes of deaths in both trials supporting this application seem to be unrelated to use of  the  product.  Section  4.8  of  the  SPC  was  updated  further  to  the  additional  data  provided  in  this application and reformatted as a table according to MedDRA terminolofy and frequency grouping.

In  conclusion,  the  benefit-risk  profile  of  the  product  is  considered  to  be  positive  to  promote  tissue sealing, and for suture support in vascular surgery and therefore, the CHMP agreed for the indication to be extended as follows:

'TachoSil is indicated for supportive treatment in surgery for improvement of haemostasis, to promote tissue sealing, and for suture support in vascular surgery where standard techniques are insufficient (see SPC section 5.1)'.
