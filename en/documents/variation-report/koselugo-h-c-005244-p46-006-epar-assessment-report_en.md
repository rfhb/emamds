## 1. Introduction

On 3 rd  of July, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Koselugo, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure(s)

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that the Phase 1 Open Label Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of Selumetinib, a Selective Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Kinase (MEK) 1 Inhibitor, in Japanese Paediatric Subjects with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and Inoperable and Symptomatic Plexiform Neurofibromas (PN) (D1346C00013) is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

In Study D1346C00013 (Study 13), selumetinib was taken orally in a 10 mg (white) or 25 mg (blue) capsule.

Batch numbers for selumetinib 10 mg: 63337.3/1, 63337.8/1, 63337.14/1

Batch numbers for selumetinib 25 mg: 63337.5/1

As recommended in the SmPC, multiple doses of selumetinib were administered at 25 mg/m 2  BID (every 12 hours) continuously for 28-day cycles (no rest periods between cycles). The dosage was adjusted for changes in Body Surface Area (BSA) and doses were to be rounded to the nearest 5 to 10 mg using a dosing nomogram ( Table 1 )

Table 1. Dosing Nomogram for the Selumetinib PK Study

| 25 mg/m²   | BSA (m²)      |   0.55 to 0.69 |   0.7 to 0.89 |   0.9 to 1.09 |   1.1 to 1.29 |   1.3 to 1.49 |   1.5 to 1.69 |   1.7 to 1.89 |   21.9 |

## Assessor's comment:

The drug products (10 and 25 mg capsules) used in Study 13 supporting clinical data in Japanese paediatric patients in this submission are already approved and deemed suitable for the claimed dosing scheme. No complementary biopharmaceutical investigation is needed.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

In Europe, selumetinib is approved (conditional market authorisation) under the brand name of Koselugo. Two strengths of hard capsules, 10 and 25 mg are available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Selumetinib is actually used as monotherapy for the treatment of symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN) in paediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) aged 3 years and above.

The recommended dose of selumetinib is 25 mg/m 2  individualised based on body surface area (BSA) and taken orally twice daily (BID). Dosing is rounded to the nearest achievable 5 mg or 10 mg dose (up to a maximum single dose of 50 mg for BSA ≥ 1.9 m 2 ). Selumetinib is not recommended in patients with a BSA &lt; 0.55 m 2 .

The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of selumetinib were sufficiently characterized in the initial MAA. Please refer to section 5.2 of the current SmPC.

In the current PAM procedure EMEA/H/C/5244/P46, the Applicant submitted the results of Study 13 : a Phase 1 Open Label Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of Selumetinib in Japanese Paediatric subjects with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and Inoperable and Symptomatic Plexiform Neurofibromas (PN)'. No change in PK properties is claimed and no change to the product information is proposed within the current PAM submission.

## 2.3.2. Clinical Pharmacology

## 2.3.2.1. Methods

## Bioanalysis

In study 13 ,  selumetinib  and  its  active  metabolite  N-desmethyl selumetinib in human plasma were quantified in human plasma were quantified using the validated ANAHPP HPLC-MS/MS method. Briefly, calibration, QC and clinical samples (50 µL) were spiked with [ 13 C6] selumetinib and [ 13 C6] N-desmethyl selumetinib as internal standards and using K2-EDTA as anticoagulant. The lower and upper limits of quantification of the method are 2.0 ng/mL and 2000 ng/mL, for selumetinib and 2.00 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL for N-desmethyl selumetinib.

24 samples were reanalysed to test for reproductibility of the method. 100% of the ISR results had a relative difference % within ± 20% for selumetinib and 79.2% for its metabolite.

## Study D1346C0013

This was an open label, single arm Phase 1 study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and clinical efficacy of selumetinib in Japanese paediatric patients with NF1 and inoperable and symptomatic PN.

Approximately 9 to 12 paediatric patients were planned to be enrolled.

At Cycle 1 Day 1, patients received multiple dose of selumetinib 25 mg/m2 BID (Dose capped at 50 mg for BSA over 1.9) on a continuous schedule (28 days per cycle). PK sampling was performed at Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1 for the assessment of before dosing and until 10-12 hour post dose.

PK samples consisted at Cycle 1 Day 1 of pre-dose, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 6, 10-12h post dose and at Cycle 2 Day 1 of pre-dose, 0.5, 1.5, 3, and 6h post dose.

Standard Plasma PK parameters after multiple dose (Cmax, Tmax, AUC, AUCt, CL/F, Vz/F and T1/2) for selumetinib and N-desmethyl selumetinib were calculated using standard non- compartmental (modelindependent) analysis methods.

PK results were retrieved from the CSR report with a cut-off date of 16 June 2021 .

## 2.3.2.2. Results

Overall 12 children aged 7.5 to 18.2 years old (median 13.25 years), with 3/9 male/female were enrolled.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Selumetinib

Geometric mean selumetinib plasma concentration-time profiles following multiple oral administration of 25  mg/m2 BID selumetinib at C1D1 and  C2D1 are shown in Table 2 and associated PK parameter estimates in Table 3. Table 4 presented the dose normalized Cmax and AUCt at C1D1.

Following multiple oral dose of selumetinib 25 mg/m 2  BID in paediatric Japanese patients, absorption of selumetinib was generally rapid with a median Tmax of 1.5h. For selumetinib, geometric mean Cmax was 869 ng/mL, AUC0-6h 2393 ng.h/mL and Rac Cmax and AUC were 1.1 and 1.3 respectively.

Overall,  the  PK  profile  in  Japanese  paediatric  patients  appeared  to  be  similar  to  that  observed  in  a previous study, SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 (Study D1532C00057; NCT01362803).

## N-desmethyl selumetinib

Conversion to the N-desmethyl metabolite from parent was low. The geometric mean metabolite to parent ratios on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1 were 7.08% and 4.70% for Cmax and 7.63% and 5.16% for AUC0-t, respectively.

## Assessor's comment:

PK results from Study 13 indicate that :

- Compared to exposure PK parameters reported in the SmPC after single dose, Japanese paediatric subject have a similar geomean Cmax (783 vs 731 ng/mL) and a 25% increased of AUC0-12h (2523 vs 2009 ng.h/mL). These results are in line with those reported in the SmPC (Section 5.2, Ethnicity).

The applicant states that selumetinib PK in this Japanese cohort were similar to those observed on the SPRINT study, however no direct comparison was presented.

Since no SmPC updates were performed by the applicant, no questions are raised.

## Methods

## Study participants

Main inclusion criteria

## Age

Subjects ≥3 years and &lt;18 years of age with a BSA ≥0.55 m 2  at the time of study enrolment who were able to swallow whole capsules.

## Disease diagnosis

- Subjects with NF1 and inoperable and symptomatic PN who had PN-related morbidities (symptom and/or complications), as judged by the Investigator.
- o Inoperable PN is defined as PN that cannot be surgically completely remove without risk for substantial morbidity due to encasement of, or close proximity to, vital structures, invasiveness, or high vascularity of the PN.
- o The PN had to cause symptoms or complications, such as (but not limited to) head and neck lesions that could compromise the airway or great vessels, paraspinal lesions that could  cause  myelopathy  brachial  or  lumbar  plexus  lesions  that  could  cause  nerve compression  and  loss  of  function,  lesions  that  could  result  in  deformity  (eg,  orbital

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lesions)  or  are  significantly  disfiguring,  lesions  of  the  extremity  that  cause  limb hypertrophy or loss of function, and painful lesions.

- o Histologic confirmation of tumour was not necessary in the presence of consistent clinical and radiographic findings but was to be considered if malignant degeneration of a PN was clinically suspected.
- o A PN is defined as a neurofibroma that has grown along the length of a nerve and may involve multiple fascicles and branches. A spinal PN involves two or more levels with connection between the levels or extending laterally along the nerve.
- o Subjects  must  have  at  least  1  other  diagnostic  criterion  for  NF1  (NIH  Consensus Development Conference Statement 1988):
- Six or more café-au-lait macules &gt;5 mm in greatest diameter in prepubertal individuals and &gt;15 mm in greatest diameter in post-pubertal individuals.
- Freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions.
- Optic glioma.
- Two or more Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas).
- A  distinctive  osseous  lesion  such  as  sphenoid  dysplasia  or  tibial pseudarthrosis.
- A first-degree relative with NF1.
- o Subjects must have at least one measurable typical or nodular PN, defined as a lesion of at least 3 cm measured in one dimension, which could be seen on at least 3 imaging slices and had a reasonably well-defined contour. Subjects who have undergone surgery for resection of a PN were eligible provided the PN was incompletely resected and was measurable. The target PN was defined as the clinically most relevant PN, which had to be amenable to volumetric MRI analysis and classified as either typical or nodular (ie must not be solitary nodular) At least 9 subjects fulfilling the above criteria were to be enrolled and receive treatment. In the event a subject had a PN lesion &lt;3 cm measured in one dimension, the subject could have been permitted entry if the PN was at least 2 cm  in  one  dimension  and  the  subject  had  to  have  significant  complications  and/or symptoms. At most, 3 such subjects could have been enrolled and received treatment. Their eligibilities were to be carefully discussed with the study physician
- Performance status: subjects &gt;16 years of age must have a Karnofsky performance level of ≥70, and children ≤16 years old must have a Lansky performance of ≥70.
- Adequate haematological function defined as absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5×109/L, haemoglobin ≥9g/dL, and platelet count ≥100×109/L.
- Adequate  organ  function  defined  as  follows:  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  and  alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2×upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin ≤1.5×ULN except in the case of patients with documented Gilbert's disease (≤2.5×ULN). Estimated creatinine clearance of ≥60 mL/minute.

## Main exclusion criteria

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Evidence of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour.
- Prior malignancy or other cancer requiring treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
- A life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction which, in the investigator's opinion,  could  compromise  the  patient's  safety,  interfere  with  the  absorption  or  metabolism  of selumetinib, or put the study outcomes at undue risk.
- Subjects with clinically significant cardiovascular disease as defined by the following:
- o Known inherited coronary disease;
- o Blood pressure (BP) &gt; the 95th percentile for age, height, and gender
- o Acute coronary syndrome within 6 months prior to starting treatment

- o Baseline LVEF below the LLN or &lt;55%
- o Severe valvular heart disease;
- o Current or history of atrial fibrillation ;
- o QT interval corrected by Fridericia's method (QTcF) &gt;450 ms or other factors that increased the risk of QT prolongation.
- Known history of human immunodeficiency virus, serologic status reflecting active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, or any uncontrolled active systemic infection

- Receiving  herbal  supplements  or  medications  known  to  be  strong  inhibitors  or  inducers  of  the cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C19 and CYP3A4 enzymes unless such products can be safely discontinued at least 14 days before the first dose of study medication.

## · Treatments

Subjects  received  selumetinib  25  mg/m2  twice  daily  (approximately  every  12  hours,  under  fasted conditions) on a continuous schedule for 28-day cycles, with no rest periods between cycles. The dose was based on BSA and rounded to the nearest 5 to 10 mg. The dose of selumetinib was capped at 50 mg when BSA was ≥1.9 m 2 . Dosing of selumetinib continued until either PD based on the Investigator's decision or unacceptable drug-related toxicity, whichever occurred first.

## Sample size

The primary objective was to determine the safety and tolerability of selumetinib. Therefore, the number of subjects was based on the desire to obtain adequate tolerability, safety and PK data while exposing as few subjects as possible to selumetinib.

Nine to 12 Japanese paediatric subjects with NF1 and inoperable and symptomatic PN were eligible to be enrolled in the study. At least nine of these subjects had to have at least one measurable typical or nodular PN in principle, defined as a lesion of at least 3 cm measured in one dimension. Up to 3 additional subjects could have been enrolled if they had a PN lesion of less than 3 cm but at least 2 cm measured in one dimension and had significant complications and/or symptoms

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

## Statistical Methods

There is no formal statistical hypothesis testing on this study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Descriptive statistics were used for all variables, as appropriate. Continuous variables were summarised by the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. For logtransformed data it was more appropriate to present geometric mean, coefficient of variation, median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables were summarised by frequency counts and percentages for each category.

## Duration of Response

As of final DCO, median duration of response (DoR) was not reached. Among 6 subjects who achieved cPR, 1 subject had progressed subsequently. The median total observation duration as of final DCO was 25.8 months (range 24.0 months to 27.2 months) for all 12 evaluable subjects.

Clinical Global Impression of Change responses over time

A total of 11 out of 12 subjects were judged by the Investigators to show an improvement from baseline in  their  PN-related  morbidities  at  Cycle,  while  9  out  of  12  subjects  reported  an  improvement  from baseline at Cycle 9, Cycle 1, Cycle 17, and Cycle 21.

Clinical Outcomes Assessment - Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since all subjects included in Study D1346C00013 were ≥5 years of age and self -reported PedsQL were applicable for all subjects, the primary outcome was the total score of child's self-reported PedsQL.

Note: This output uses all data available until the date of final data cut-off. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals for each respective mean change from baseline. Higher scores indicate better quality of life, so an increase in score is favourable. Baseline is defined as the last result obtained prior to the start of study treatment.

AE=Adverse event. N=Total number of subjects.

No AEs leading to death or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported.

A single subject (8.3%) reported 2 SAEs, both Grade 3 events of paronychia, one of which was assessed as related to study drug. Both SAEs resolved without any action with study drug.

All non-serious AEs were mild or moderate in severity (Common Terminology Criteria for AE Grade 1 or 2) as of Cycle 13 Day 1.

Considering  all  data  up  to  DCO2,  3  (25.0%)  subjects  experienced  a  total  of  4  AEs  leading  to  dose interruption (2 events of ejection fraction decreased in 1 subject each that led to dose reduction, and 1 event each of ALT increased and AST increased that resulted in drug interruption in 1 subject each, respectively). The 2 (16.7%) subjects who reported ejection fraction decreased (1 AE each) as of Cycle 13 Day 1 continued selumetinib treatment at a lower dose after dose interruption.

A total of 4 (33.3%) subjects had at 5 AESIs, with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) time to onset of 133.0 days (120.0) as of Cycle 13 Day 1. These included 3 AESIs related to muscular toxicity, including Grade 1 blood creatine phosphokinase increased (1 subject) and myalgia (1 subject with 2 events), and 2 AESIs related to cardiac toxicity, of Grade 2 ejection fraction decreased (1 subject with 1 event, each, as mentioned above). All AESIs were identified during routine investigations, were not associated with any clinical sequelae. All AESIs had resolved as of DCO2, except for 1 AESI of Grade 2 ejection fraction decreased.

Some laboratory values showed fluctuations during the study (lymphocytes, ALT, AST, and bilirubin). However, no clinically important changes in laboratory values were observed.

## 2.3.4. Discussion on clinical aspects

The  Applicant  provided  results  of  a  Phase  1  Open  Label  Study  that  aimed  to  assess  the  Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Clinical Efficacy of Selumetinib in Japanese Paediatric subjects with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and Inoperable Plexiform Neurofibromas (PN).

There was no primary efficacy endpoint for this study. As of final DCO, BOR was cPR for 6 (50.0%) subjects, unconfirmed PR for 1 (8.3%) subject, stable disease for 3 (25.0%) subjects, and PD for 2 (16.7%) subjects

Assessed  by  CGIC  responses  9  out  of  12  subjects  were  judged  by  the  Investigators  to  show  an improvement from baseline in their PN-related morbidities (symptom and/or complications).

Overall, the efficacy results in the paediatric cohort are coherent with those observed in SPRINT study during the initial marketing authorisation assessment of Koselugo. However, the interpretability of these results is limited due to the small number of subjects included and the open-label design of the study.

Safety data from this study as of DCO2 has demonstrated that selumetinib monotherapy at a dose of 25 mg/m2 BID in Japanese paediatric subjects with NF1 and inoperable PN are consistent with the safety profile of selumetinib as stated under the section 4.4 and 4.8 of Koselugo SmPC and no new safety issues have been identified.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

From a clinical Pharmacology perspective, the PK of selumetinib and its metabolite was characterized in a small cohort of 12 paediatric Japanese subjects aged 7.5 to 18.2 years old and results from this study are in line with those reported in Koselugo Section 5.2, Ethnicity.

Based on the data provided by the MAH regarding the results of D1346C00013 study, no new safety or efficacy  concerns  have been identified as compared to previous studies and experiences in subjects treated with Koselugo.
