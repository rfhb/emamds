The MAH took the opportunity to delete the version number of the DDPS and update the version number of the RMP in Annex II, to update the PI according to the current SmPC Guideline (September 2009) and QRD template (version 7.3.1) and to introduce a minor editorial change and update | 16/12/2010 | 27/01/2011 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | Bullous conditions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, as well as sepsis and haemolytic anaemia have been reported in patients receiving pemetrexed and the causal association with pemetrexed has not been excluded. Moreover, third-space fluid (e.g. pleural effusion or ascites) does not seem to affect the pharmacokinetics of permetrexed and drainage of such fluid may not be necessary prior to pemetrexed administration. Finally, the administration of NSAIDs with long half-lives (such as ibuprofen) in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of and at least 2 days after pemetrexed administration. |

| II/0008   | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet          | 20/09/2007   | 31/10/2007 | SmPC and PL            | The MAH has applied for a type II variation, upon request by the CHMP following the assessment of the 4th PSUR, to update sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC with information regarding the ADR 'radiation pneumonitis' and section 4.8 of the SPC with information regarding the ADRs 'colitis' and 'interstitial pneumonitis'. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. During post marketing surveillance, cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients treated with radiation either prior, during or subsequent to their pemetrexed therapy. Particular attention should be paid to these patients and caution exercised with use of other radiosensitising agents. In clinical trials, cases of colitis (including intestinal and rectal bleeding, sometimes fatal, intestinal perforation, intestinal necrosis and typhlitis) have been reported uncommonly in patients treated with pemetrexed. In clinical trials, cases of interstitial pneumonitis with respiratory insufficiency, sometimes fatal, have been reported uncommonly in patients treated with pemetrexed. |

| II/0004 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet | 14/12/2006 | 26/01/2007 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) applied for a type II variation, upon request by CHMP following the assessment of the 3rd PSUR, to update sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC to include information regarding acute renal failure. Serious renal events, including acute renal failure, have been reported with pemetrexed alone or in association with other chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the patients in whom these occurred had underlying risk factors for the development of renal events including dehydration or pre- existing hypertension or diabetes. Further, the MAH has made an editorial change in section 4.2 and a minor amendment to the warning regarding yellow fever vaccine in section 4.4 for increased clarity. Immunodepressed status is common in cancer patients. As a result, concomitant use of live attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever which is contraindicated) is not recommended. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to revise the Annexes in line with the latest QRD template and to include the local representatives of BUL and ROM in the Package Leaflet. |
