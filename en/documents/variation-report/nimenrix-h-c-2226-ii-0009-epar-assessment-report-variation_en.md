## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Introduction

Nimenrix is a tetravalent meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccine (hereafter referred to as ACWY-TT) and consists of 5µg per dose dose of Neisseria meningitidis capsular polysaccharides A, C, W-135 and Y, each coupled to tetanus toxoid (TT) as carrier protein. The vaccine contains approximately 44µg of TT per dose. Nimenrix was licensed for use in the EU on 20 April 2012 for the active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and above against invasive meningococcal disease caused by N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y.

The purpose of this variation is to update the SmPC with data from 12 clinical studies that have been completed since submission of the MAA. All 12 studies assessed antibody persistence. Populations studied included children vaccinated as toddlers between 12 and 23 months of age, children 2-10 years of age, adolescents and adults. All of the studies enrolled subjects that had received primary vaccination in clinical trials submitted during the MAA. One of the studies (MenACWY-TT-048 [EXT-039] Y4) also evaluated the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of a booster dose of the same vaccine (ACWY-TT or Meningitec) that had been administered for primary vaccination to toddlers between 12 and 23 months of age in study MenACWY-TT-039.

Data from these studies have been used to update Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties of the SmPC (Persistence of immune response and Immune memory sections). In addition, tables in Section 5.1 have been updated to include a footnote indicating where each SBA assay was performed. Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration, has been modified to remove that administration of Nimenrix in subjects previously vaccinated with plain polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine represents a booster dose. This is because the immune response following plain polysaccharide vaccination is not considered boostable given the T-cell independent nature of the immune response to plain polysaccharide. Furthermore the warning regarding serum bactericidal antibody titres against serogroup A when using human complement in the assay in Section 4.4 has been aligned with the warning in the SmPC of Menveo. Table numbers have been updated to incorporate the additional tables added to the SmPC.

## 1.2. Clinical Efficacy aspects

## 1.2.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

## Study design

All of the persistence studies, and the booster study MenACWY-TT-048 (EXT-039) Y4, were open in design. This was because subjects (or their parents/ guardians) were informed of their treatment group assignment after results were available from the original primary vaccination studies, and all subjects participating in extension studies remained assigned to the same treatment groups as in the primary vaccination study. Subjects (or their parents or guardians) who had received vaccination in the primary vaccination studies were contacted by the investigator and invited to participate in the follow-up studies at the designated time points after vaccination. In the persistence studies, immunological assessment comprised a single blood sample at a given post-vaccination time point for determination of persisting antibody levels to vaccine antigens. In the booster study MenACWY-TT-048 (EXT-039) Y4 study duration

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was approximately 1 month and immunological assessment comprised a blood sample prior to and one month after booster vaccination for the determination of antibodies to vaccine antigens.

*The primary immunological end-point was serum bactericidal activity assay using baby rabbit and human complement sources (rSBA and hSBA as well as anti-polysaccharide antibodies

Overall, enrolment criteria in studies were similar and included healthy subjects without history of intercurrent meningococcal disease and who had not received vaccination with any meningococcal vaccine outside of the primary vaccination study.

The extension studies for antibody persistence were conducted in Europe (Germany, Finland, and France), Asia (the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and India) and the United States. The evaluation of booster vaccination in children originally vaccinated as toddlers 12-23 months of age was conducted in Europe (Finland).

During the procedure the MAH informed that GCP issues have been identified with some sites in studies MenACWY-TT-036 and -043. Consequently, updates of the SmPC with data from these studies were withdrawn from the scope of this variation. The MAH has confirmed that upon completion of impact analysis updated Clinical Study Reports will be provided (and Product Information updates proposed, as appropriate). It is not expected that these GCP issues would impact the conclusions of the studies. The MAH's proposal was accepted by the CHMP.

## Immunogenicity assays

All tests were performed at GSK Biologicals' central laboratory and at the Health Protection Agency (HPA) in the UK, using standardised, validated procedures with adequate controls.

GSKs rSBA is no longer used for the evaluation of rSBA after vaccination with meningococcal conjugate vaccines. Testing is now done at the HPA laboratory in the UK, for which a titre of 8 was shown to correlate with vaccine effectiveness against serogroup C (Andrews, 2003). Functional anti-meningococcal serogroup activity (rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBAMenW-135, and rSBA-MenY) was determined by a serum bactericidal test developed from the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) protocol (Maslanka, 1997) using baby rabbit complement. The cut-off of the assay was a dilution of 8. Titres were expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution resulting in 50% inhibition. Bactericidal antibodies were recognized as surrogate markers of protection. The percentage of subjects with rSBA titres ≥ 8 was shown to be consistent with observed efficacy at four weeks after vaccination with the meningococcal C conjugate vaccine in postlicensure efficacy estimates in the United Kingdom (Andrews, 2003). For serogroups A, W-135 and Y, no correlates of protection have been established yet. However, as for commercially available tetravalent meningococcal plain polysaccharide vaccines, the immunogenicity endpoint for these three serogroups was inferred from the serogroup C experience based on similar immunogenicity criteria.

The following strains were used in each assay:

- MenA: strain 3125
- MenC: strain C11
- MenW-135: strain MP01240070 (referred to as MP)
- MenY: strain S-1975

Functional anti-meningococcal serogroup activity was also measured by a serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA-MenA, hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW-135, and hSBA-MenY). The protocol for GSK's hSBA assay was adapted from the CDC protocol for rSBA assays. The cut-off of the test was a dilution of 4. Titres were expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution resulting in 50% inhibition. For MenC, a baseline serum bactericidal titre of ≥ 4 is a strong predictor of protection (Goldschneider, 1969). To date, no MenA, W-135, or Y baseline serum bactericidal titre predictive of protection have been published, and the hSBA cut off for these serogroups is inferred from the one identified for MenC by Goldschneider. In this variation the percentage of subjects reaching the more conservative cut-off of 8 is reported.

During the procedure the CHMP requested to clarify whether the in-house hSBA assay has been bridged to any other laboratory's hSBA assay. The MAH responded that, unlike the rSBA where the Public Health England (PHE) laboratory is a well-established laboratory and the assay has been used to determine a Correlate of Protection (COP), no such laboratory exists for the hSBA. The assay used by Goldschneider et al. (1969) to generate the hSBA COP is no longer available for comparisons. The MAH has therefore not bridged its assay to another laboratory and has no plans at this time to bridge its assay. However, the MAH is working to better define the assay validation parameters. The MAH has developed a plan to evaluate ways to reduce the variability of the hSBA. Experiments for this supplemental validation include reassessment of the calculation method (interpolation of titres between dilutions vs. discontinuous titres) and determining the effect of using single or duplicate values for the calculation of sample titres. In addition, the plan calls for increasing the amount of data and number of samples used to define the assay LOD/LOQ (Lower limits of detection and quantification). These studies will confirm the precision of the lower end of the analytical range. The MAH committed to provide this data to the EMA, once available.

## Statistical methods

The primary cohorts for the analysis of persistence were the according-to-protocol (ATP) persistence cohorts. If more than 5% of enrolled subjects with serological results at each persistence time point were excluded from the ATP cohort, second analysis based on the total vaccinated cohort was performed to support the ATP analysis. The primary cohort for the analysis of booster vaccination in study MenACWYTT 048 (EXT-039) Y4 was the ATP booster immunogenicity cohort. If, for any vaccine group, the percentage of subjects who came back with serological results excluded from the ATP cohort was higher than 5%, a second analysis based on the total cohort was to be performed to complement the ATP analysis. In all studies and for each group, seropositivity rates with exact 95% confidence interval (CI) and GMC/T, with 95% CI, were calculated using standard methods. The geometric mean antibody concentration/titre (GMC/GMT) calculations were performed by taking the anti-logarithm of the mean of the logarithm10 concentration/titre transformations. Antibody concentrations/titres below the cut-off of the assay were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMC/GMT calculation. In some studies, exploratory analyses were performed to indicate potential differences between the ACWYTT group and controls. The exclusion of 1 from the 95% CI on the GMC/GMT ratios or 0% from the 95% CI on the differences in seroprotection / seropositivity rates was defined as potential group differences. Potential differences should be interpreted with caution because there was no adjustment for multiplicity for these comparisons and the clinical relevance of any difference was not accounted for.

## Demographic characteristics

In each study the demographic profile of subjects was similar in the ACWY-TT and control groups. The distribution of race/ethnicity among the individual studies reflects the regions where the studies were

conducted. Antibody persistence was evaluated in children who were vaccinated with ACWY-TT 3 or 4 years previously when aged 9-23 months or aged 2-&lt;11 years. The total number included 104 subjects in whom persistence was assessed after having been vaccinated with 2 priming ACWY-TT doses. Antibody persistence was also evaluated in adolescents and adults who had been vaccinated 3 to 4 years previously with a single dose of ACWY-TT.

In study MenACWY-TT-048 (EXT-039) Y4, a booster dose of ACWY-TT was administered to 245 children 4 years after the priming dose. The mean age of subjects in the ATP booster immunogenicity cohort in this study was 63.7 months (SD ± 1.78 months). The numbers of females: males were 124:134. The majority (99.6%) of subjects were Caucasian. The demographic characteristics of the two study groups were comparable.

Antibody persistence in children aged 12-23 months at vaccination

## Booster dose at Y4

Subjects primed with ACWY-TT or Meningitec in the second year of life in study MenACWY-TT-039 received a booster dose of the same vaccines in the extension study MenACWYTT-048 at Y4. Pre- and post-booster blood samples were tested for SBA using the HPA rSBA and GSK hSBA assays.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results for serogroup C: One month after the booster dose the percentage of subjects with HPA rSBA titres ≥ 8 and the percentage with hSBA titres ≥ 8 was 100% in both groups. Compared to pre-booster levels, the post-booster HPA rSBA GMT for serogroup C increased by 371.0-fold in the ACWY-TT group, and by 260.2-fold in the group that received Meningitec . The post-booster hSBA GMT increased by 531.1fold in the ACWY-TT group and 704.4-fold in the group that received Meningitec .

Results for serogroups A, W-135 and Y: The percentage of subjects in the ACWY-TT group with HPA rSBA titres ≥ 8 one month after the booster dose was 100%, and the percentage with hSBA titres ≥ 8 was at least 99.5%. For each of these serogroups the post-booster rSBA GMTs increased by at least 65.1-fold compared to pre-booster levels. A robust booster response (using rSBA and hSBA) was observed in ACWY-TT-primed children.

## Antibody persistence at Y3 and Y4

Antibody persistence was assessed 3 and 4 years after vaccination with ACWY-TT or Meningitec in the second year of life in study MenACWYTT-048[EXT-039]. Four years after vaccination, the percentage of subjects with HPA rSBA antibody titres ≥ 8 for serogroup C was 40.4% in the ACWY-TT group and 35.6% in the group that had received Meningitec. The percentage of subjects with hSBA antibody titres ≥ 8 for serogroup C was 73.2% in the ACWY-TT group and 46.9% in the group that had received Meningitec.

For the other serogroups the percentage of subjects in the ACWY-TT group with rSBA titres ≥ 8 at Y4 was 74.1% for serogroup A, 49.3% for serogroup W-135 and 58.2% for serogroup Y. Because of the change in rSBA assay between Year 2 and Year 3, the Year 4 rSBA GMTs cannot be compared to pre-vaccination values. The percentage of subjects in the ACWY-TT group with hSBA titres ≥ 8 was 28.8% for serogroup A, 80.6% for serogroup W-135 and 65.4% for serogroup Y.

Of note, due to observed variability between year 3 and year 4 results the MAH is planning to re-test MenACWY-TT-048 Y3 and Y4 samples with the MenA rSBA at PHE on all subjects in the ATP cohort (160 subjects have been identified) in which sera is available for both time-points. The timing for the availability of the results will depend on the resolution of the on-going MenA rSBA investigation at PHE. The MAH has committed to provide the results upon their availability within the next submission related to clinical data.

## Longer-term protection after a single dose in children aged 1-2 years

Based on presented results the CHMP requested during the procedure that the MAH discusses the need to advise either 2 doses in the second year of life or a booster dose within 4 years of a single dose administered between 1-2 years of age.

In responses the MAH stated that the available immunogenicity data following one dose of Nimenrix in toddlers demonstrate immune responses that are at least as high as those to an approved MenC conjugate vaccine and show immune responses higher than those to plain ACWY polysaccharides in older children.

It is not excluded that a second dose of Nimenrix in the second year of life may elicit higher antibody titres. However, the MAH stated that it is unknown if higher antibody titres are predictive of better longterm antibody persistence. As previously reported [Borrow 2005; Goldschneider 1969], thresholds used as correlates of protection may underestimate protection; in addition, although authorised MenC conjugate vaccines induce different immune responses [Borrow 2009b], they all have contributed equally in the successful immunisation program with MenC conjugate vaccine in the UK [Campbell 2009].

Following a CHMP request and agreement on the study protocol, the MAH is conducting a study (MenACWY-TT-104) evaluating immunogenicity and safety of 1 and 2 doses of Nimenrix in toddlers. The study is planned to follow-up antibody persistence up to 5 years after vaccination in order to evaluate the potential impact of a second dose at long-term protection. The results of the vaccination phase of this study will be provided to CHMP for evaluation, when available.

There is a second ongoing study (MenACWY-TT-062) which is the follow-up phase of study MenACWY-TT055 evaluating the antibody persistence at 1, 3 and 5 years post-vaccination with one (at 12 months) or two doses (at 9 and 12 months) of Nimenrix. Currently data from Year 3 persistence time-point with GSK hSBA and PHE rSBA assays has been provided. As presented in tables below, three years after vaccination the percentages of subject with rSBA and hSBA titres ≥ 8 and rSBA and hSBA GMTs were similar between study groups for all four serogroups except for MenW-135 when antibody titres were measured by hSBA.

According to the MAH the need for a booster dose may depend on use of Nimenrix under different settings. Nimenrix could potentially be used in different age groups and different circumstances:

- Nimenrix could be used to provide protection to individuals at increased risk of meningococcal diseases such as travellers, overseas workers, military recruits and personnel who may travel to destinations where meningococcal vaccine is recommended or disease is endemic. In these cases, individual protection of immunised individuals is targeted and the antibody persistence data generated in clinical studies would help to evaluate the need for a booster dose. The MAH has generated and is planning to generate antibody persistence data across age groups. In the three antibody persistence studies in toddlers, a booster dose is planned at different follow-up time points: 4, 5 and up to and including10 years after administration of Nimenrix in studies -048, -055 and 027, respectively. Of note, the data related to booster dose in study -048 are available and is a part of the current type II variation. In the 2 to 10 year age group, a booster dose is planned in persistence studies -059 and -088 at 5 Year and 68 Month follow-up time points. A booster vaccination is scheduled at 5, 7 and 10 Year persistence time points respectively in studies -059, -043 and -015 that enrolled adolescents and adults.
- Nimenrix could also be used in countries with existing MenC recommendations to expand serogroup coverage or included as a routine vaccination in other countries in all indicated age groups. The UK experience with routine use of MenC conjugate vaccines highlighted the potential indirect positive effects that can be achieved with meningococcal vaccines [Campbell, 2009]. In the case where Nimenrix is included as a routine vaccination in national vaccination schedules, in addition to the persistence and booster trials, epidemiological surveillance data would be useful to monitor for potential vaccine failures against meningococcal disease. In line with the Risk Management Plan (RMP), the MAH commits to explore collaboration with relevant national public health authorities and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

support the enhancement of epidemiological surveillance for the identification and monitoring of breakthrough cases if conditions described in the RMP will be met.

## Antibody persistence in children aged 2-10 years at vaccination

In MenACWY-TT-088[EXT-081] antibody persistence at 32 and 44 months was assessed in children who had been vaccinated with ACWY-TT or Menjugate when aged between 2 and 10 years.

At Month 44 the percentage of subjects with serogroup C rSBA titres ≥ 8 was 37.0% in the ACWY-TT group and 45.5% in the Menjugate group. The percentage of subjects in the ACWY-TT group with rSBA titres ≥ 8 was 87.5% for serogroup A, 68.3% for serogroup W-135 and 62.4% for serogroup Y. The observed serogroup A rSBA GMT in the ACWY-TT group increased from Year 3 to Year 4, although the 95% CIs for both time points overlapped.

The percentage of subjects with hSBA titres ≥ 8 for serogroup A in the initial analysis appeared to increase between Month 32 and Month 44 (no overlap of 95% CIs). This increase was unexpected and coincided with observations in the laboratory of higher than average discordance between past and present titres obtained for the validation of a new lot of human complement. GSK therefore undertook investigations to assess the cause of this apparent anomaly. Re-testing of samples under different conditions identified that the transition to the use of stackers during incubation in the orbital shaker led to an overestimation of titres, particularly low titres. In view of these findings the use of stackers has ceased and samples from study MenACWY-TT-088(EXT-081) M44 were re-tested using methods (i.e. without stackers) consistent with those used at previous time points. Results of the re-testing are presented below.

At Month 44 the percentage of subjects with hSBA titres ≥ 8 for serogroup C was 76.8% in the ACWY-TT group and 64.5% in the group that received Menjugate . The observed serogroup C GMTs declined from Month 32 to Month 44 in both groups. For the other serogroups, the percentage of subjects with hSBA titres ≥ 8 in the ACWY-TT group was 25.8% for serogroup A, 80.5% for serogroup W-135 and 82.9% for serogroup Y.

## Increase in responses from year 3 to year 4

During the procedure the CHMP raised questions regarding the increase in titres from Y3 to Y4 in studies 048 and 088. Consequently the MAH and PHE jointly reviewed the quality and performance aspects of the MenA rSBA. The combined team reviewed the performance of the control serum and other control parameters including the number of control colonies per assay and the complement mediated killing. In addition the team reviewed the control data generated from individual technicians to confirm individual performance. In all cases, there have been no indications that either the control or assay performance characteristics have significantly deviated over time.

In addition, the team also reviewed the qualification of the critical reagent, rabbit complement. An initial investigation of the qualification data has confirmed that all of the complement lots, used during the analysis of the MenACWY-048 and MenACWY-088, have passed the qualification parameters and were acceptable for use. However, a preliminary review of the control data for the rabbit complement lot used during the testing of MenACWY-048 year 4 indicates that this lot may have had a higher level of activity as compared to the lot of rabbit complement used in the analysis of year 3 samples. This investigation into the complement lots is continuing. While the investigation is still ongoing, the team has been unable to identify an assay related root cause for the increase in MenA rSBA titres from year 3 to year 4 in either MenACWYTT- 048 or MenACWY-TT-088.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As no analytical root cause has been identified, the MAH re-examined the available year 3 and year 4 data to determine if there is another plausible explanation. A review of the MenA IgG ELISA data from MenACWY-TT-048 has shown a possible explanation for the rSBA titre increase. Between year 3 and year 4 there is an increase in the IgG ELISA GMC values. While this increase is apparent in the GMC values, it is also visible in the proportion of seroresponders above the 2.0μg/mL level. For the MenACWY treatment group the seroresponder rate increased from 17.9% to 49.1%. Similarly, for the MenCCRM group that was not vaccinated with a MenA containing vaccine, the seroresponder rate increased from 2.7% to 20.7%. Clearly, a rise in the anti-MenA IgG concentrations has been triggered between the year 3 and year 4 samples. As the rSBA and IgG ELISA do not share any common reagents, the MAH stated that it is difficult to imagine a scenario where both assays would be similarly affected by a laboratory error. Based on this information, the MAH concluded that while a partial explanation for the year 4 increase in MenA rSBA titres could be the use of a potentially more active complement lot, the main reason for the increase in MenA rSBA titres is a real increase in anti-MenA antibody, supported by the IgG ELISA data.

For MenACWY-088 the results were less clear as for MenACWY-048. There is no supportive MenA IgG ELISA data to demonstrate a correlative rise, or not, in ELISA titres. However, the magnitude of rise in the MenA rSBA titres is much smaller as compared to the titre increase observed in MenACWY-048 (1.52- fold (± 1 dilution well), the differences observed in the GMTs may be due strictly to the rSBA assay to be due to assay variability in which the assay was running slightly higher during the analysis of the used some common lots during the analysis of the year 4 samples.

The table indicates that the increase in HPA rSBA MenA titres from Y3 to Y4 is not caused by a selection of subjects that returned for the Y4 subjects. The percentage of subjects with HPA rSBA MenA titres ≥ to the Y4 visit (60.4% versus 56.8%, respectively).

fold vs. 5-fold). In addition, with an estimated assay variability for a discontinuous calculation system of variability. Therefore, at this time, the MAH attributed the small increase in the GMCs for MenACWY-088 year 4 samples. This could possibly be due to the complement lot, as MenACWY-048 and MenACWY-088 Since the initial reporting of the data for MenACWY-048 and MenACWY-088 and as part of the routine QC system in place at GSK, a control panel of sera was sent to the PHE laboratory. An examination of the data has indicated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were not met. At this time, no explanation has been identified; however, a combined team of the MAH and PHE is evaluating whether faulty sample panel preparation could be one possible explanation. At this time there is no indication of an analytical cause for the failure as all QC results are within acceptance parameters. The review of the lab is ongoing and all MenA rSBA testing has been halted until the investigation has been completed. The MAH has committed to update the EMA with the outcome of the current investigation. To investigate if the increase in HPA MenA rSBA responses was due to a selection of subjects that did or did not come back for the Y4 visit, additional analysis was performed. In Table below the HPA rSBA titres are provided for MenA for the subjects who did and did not come back for the Y4 visit. The reverse cumulative curves for the HPA rSBA MenA titres for the subjects who did or did not come back for the Y4 visit are provided in Figure 1. 1:8 for subjects that come back for visit 4 is similar to the percentage of subjects that did not come back

## Antibody persistence in adolescents and adults

In MenACWY-TT-043[EXT-036] antibody persistence was assessed at 3 and 4 years after vaccination when subjects were aged between 11 and 17 years. At Y4 the percentage of subjects in the ACWY-TT group with HPA rSBA antibody titres ≥ 8 was 90.1% for serogroup A, 94.3% for serogroup C, 77.4% for serogroup W-135 and 89.5% for serogroup Y. In the group that received Mencevax the percentages were 80.5%, 87.2% 27.3% and 48.5%, respectively. Because of the change in rSBA assay between Year 2 and Year 3, the Year 4 rSBA GMTs cannot be compared to pre-vaccination values.

In MenACWY-TT-059 [EXT-052] antibody persistence was assessed 3 years after vaccination with ACWYTT or Menactra in adolescents and young adults aged 11-25 years. At Y3 the percentage of subjects with hSBA antibody titres ≥ 8 in the ACWY-TT group was 37.3% for serogroup A, 93.1% for serogroup C, 95.4% for serogroup W-135 and 96.0% for serogroup Y. In the Menactra group the percentages were 48.1%, 81.5%, 85.0% and 88.8%, respectively. The hSBA GMTs for serogroups C, W-135 and Y at the Year 3 persistence time point remained above pre-vaccination titres. By contrast, serogroup A GMTs had decreased to almost baseline levels.

## 1.2.3. Discussion

This report describes the data underpinning the additions proposed for the SmPC in section 5.1. It should be noted that additional data on longer-term antibody levels were previously assessed in various reports from the MAA onwards. However, the new data to be added to the SmPC have been confined to those studies where sequential samplings were assayed using the same techniques in the same laboratories and are therefore a justifiably selective set of data.

The design, methodology, inclusion criteria and statistical methodology used in the studies are broadly acceptable. Demographic characteristics are comparable between groups and different studies included children aged 12-23 months, children aged 2-10 years and adolescents and adults in the age range 11-25 years.

The GSK rSBA and HPA rSBA assays were previously shown to report similar patterns of responses but different actual titres/GMTs. To follow antibody decay over time only data generated using the same assay can be viewed as appropriate and even this assumption rests on low inter-assay variability since the post-primary and later samples would have been assayed in different runs.

The difference between rSBA and hSBA results is well recognised and was first described in the 1950s. Again, although the most common observation is that the same trends are shown using either rSBA or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hSBA, to follow antibody persistence the same assay should be used in the same laboratory. Even then, there is still the question over the use of different runs and the impact on the assay of any change in source of human complement, which is well known to impact on the reported titres.

In addition, the data reported in this application suggest that, as with the MAH's own rSBA assay, the MAH's hSBA assay seems to be very sensitive and may be over-reporting titres. However, in the absence of international standards it is not possible to comment further on this.

The results of MenACWY-TT-088 (EXT-081) showed an unexplained increase in SBA titres at year 4 compared to year 3. This increase was unexpected and coincided with higher than average discordance between past and present titres obtained when validating a new lot of human complement. Investigations were undertaken to assess the cause of this apparent anomaly. Re-testing of samples under different conditions identified that the transition to the use of stackers during incubation in the orbital shaker led to an overestimation of titres, particularly low titres. In view of these findings the use of stackers has ceased and samples from study MenACWY-TT-088(EXT-081) M44 were re-tested using methods (i.e. without stackers) consistent with those used at previous time points. Other studies reported in this variation were tested prior to the change in the hSBA and are thus not affected.

Variability in runs is a recognised issue especially for functional antibody assays such as SBA and may have contributed to the variability observed for titres against some meningococcal groups. Which of the SBA assays best reflects the true functional antibody titres is unknown. However, with clarification in the revised SmPC regarding which assay was used the informed reader should be able to appreciate the likely reasons for the apparent anomalies (see also below).

For children aged 12-23 months at vaccination the rSBA data show comparable antibody persistence at Y4 between the Nimenrix and Meningitec groups whereas the hSBA data suggest lower persistence for Meningitec. This differential between assays has been noted in prior studies and it must be remembered that the two sources of complement do influence the total functional antibody titres observed. Which of the two sets of results is the more accurate in describing the actual residual functional antibody is not known but there is no disadvantage for Nimenrix, which is reassuring.

In all cases the post-boost data demonstrate a convincing anamnestic response. While there is no group of unvaccinated children of the same age that would provide a definitive control population, the actual GMTs observed post-boost clearly indicate that both Nimenrix and Meningitec elicited a T-cell-dependent primary immune response.

What is notable is that with the exception of MenA, the hSBA GMTs post-boost were higher than the rSBA GMTs post-boost. Again, the assay differences are marked and suggest that the MAH's hSBA assay is unusually sensitive. However, this does not negate the overall conclusions. It has been documented that hSBA assays routinely report low responses to MenA and a rapid decline in titres, which seems to be an issue specific to MenA and to the use of hSBA assays to measure functional antibody directed against MenA rather than a matter that is related to the performance of any one vaccine.

In study MecACWY-TT-048 the rSBA data show some seemingly anomalous findings for Y3 and Y4 for the MenA data and for the MenC data in the Meningitec group in that there were notable increases in percentages with titres at least 1:8 and GMTs in the 12-month period between sampling. In contrast, the hSBA data show the expected small differences in titres over the Y3-Y4 period when the antibody decay curve would be expected to have reached a plateau.

The differences between Y3 and Y4 results are further discussed below. Nevertheless, both rSBA and hSBA data show no major decreases between Y3 and Y4 for SBA titres against any meningococcal group. In particular, although the MenA hSBA titres decreased quite markedly post-vaccination as was expected from all prior data there was a plateau effect observed between Y3 and Y4. Inclusion of these data in the SmPC is supported. While some readers who are unfamiliar with the vagaries of SBA assays may be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

surprised by some of the data, the data is useful for prescribers and the EPAR should sufficiently explain the fact that the data do not raise any new concerns for Nimenrix.

The Year 4-5 data point to the need to consider advising either 2 doses in the second year of life (an ongoing study is examining this) or advising giving consideration to a booster dose within 4 years if priming occurred between the ages of 1-2 years. However, it does not seem appropriate to mandate either approach given the influence of the circumstances of use. The CHMP therefore agrees that there is currently no sufficient data to advise either 2 doses in the second year of life or a booster dose in all cases after a single dose administered between 1-2 years of age. Therefore it is supported that the statement 'The need for a booster dose in subjects primed with Nimenrix has not been established.' remains in SmPC section 4.2, while SmPC section 4.4. and 5.1 are updated, to allow for a booster dose to be administered in some cases in order to provide individual protection to toddlers at increased risk of meningococcal diseases (for example in the case of a toddler travelling to areas where meningococcal disease due to serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y is endemic).

Initially submitted hSBA data on antibody persistence in children aged 2-10 years at vaccination showed an increase between Month 32 and Month 44. The MAH conducted a re-analysis, which yielded results without a marked increase in the proportion of subjects with hSBA-MenA titres ≥1:8 or in hSBA-MenA geometric mean titres between Y3 and Y4 that were observed in the previous analysis. However, an apparent increase in anti-Y SBA titres is still present.

To investigate the increase in MenA rSBA titres from Y3 to Y4 the MAH has reviewed MenA IgG ELISA data from MenACWY-TT-048, showing an increase in geometric mean antibody concentrations, comparable to the increase in rSBA titres. Although the rabbit complement lot used in the testing of MenACWY-048 year 4 may have had a higher level of activity than that used in the Y3 samples, and may have contributed in part to the higher MenA rSBA titres, there is evidence to suggest that there was a real increase in anti-MenA antibodies between Y3 and Y4, even though this would be an unexpected finding in a Finnish paediatric population. MenA IgG ELISA data are not available for MenACWY-088, which was conducted in France and Germany, but in this study the increase in rSBA titres was less marked.

An analysis of the titres of those who did and did not return at Y4 showed that the proportions with titres ≥1:8 are comparable, suggesting that the titres of those dropping out before Y4 were no lower than those continuing to Y4. Therefore it now seems unlikely that the apparent increase in SBA titres was influenced by dropouts between Y3 and Y4.

A control panel of sera from GSK sent to the PHE laboratory failed predetermined acceptance criteria, and the issue is being investigated further. Despite this, there is no obvious explanation for the anomalous findings in the MenA rSBA titres between Y3 and Y4. However, these findings do not affect the overall conclusions on antibody persistence for Nimenrix.

It is acknowledged, that it may look odd to readers of the SmPC that SBA titres increased between Y3 and Y4, especially for study 048 in which the increment was larger. While the increase in MenA SBA titres was unexpected, it is still regarded appropriate to include this data to the SmPC with a footnote to the table to state that the MenA IgG GMC also increased.

For the antibody persistence in adolescents and adults the MAH proposes to include in the SmPC the HPA rSBA data in the age group 11-17 years and the MAH's own hSBA data from the age range 11-25 years. Although this is not ideal (due to a difference in both the assay and the age range), the two datasets provide potentially useful information. In addition, the data from the follow-up of study 036 provide a comparison with unconjugated polysaccharide vaccine, which is informative.

## 1.3. Clinical Safety aspects

## 1.3.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

Of the 12 clinical trials presented in this variation, 11 consisted of a single study visit for collection of a blood sample for the purposes of assessing antibody persistence. In these long term serological follow-up studies, the occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs) considered as related to vaccination or to study participation that had occurred since the previous study visit was recorded retrospectively. Because no vaccination was administered, no other safety parameters were assessed.

## Safety after booster vaccination

Study MenACWY-TT-048 (EXT-039) Y4 was a Phase III, open, controlled, multicentre extension of study MenACWY-TT-039. Toddlers who had been vaccinated with ACWYTT (with or without co-administration of Priorix Tetra) or with Meningitec (given before or after a first dose of Priorix Tetra), received a booster dose of the same meningococcal vaccine 4 years later. The assessment of reactogenicity and safety were secondary objectives in study MenACWY-TT-048 (EXT-039) Y4.

## 1.3.2. Results

No SAEs considered as related to vaccination or to study participation that had occurred since the previous study visit were recorded in any of the studies presented in this variation.

## Safety after booster vaccination

There were 294 children enrolled and 293 who received vaccination in the booster phase of study MenACWY-TT-048 (EXT-039) Y4. Of these, 245 subjects received a second dose of ACWY-TT and 48 subjects received a booster dose of Meningitec. Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local solicited symptom after the booster dose during the 8-day follow-up period, reported by 61.3% of ACWY-TT recipients and 48.9% of Meningitec recipients. The most frequently reported grade 3 local symptom was redness (16.0% of subjects in the ACWY-TT group and 10.6% in the Meningitec group). Drowsiness and irritability were the most frequently reported systemic solicited symptoms after the booster dose, reported by 16.9% and 16.5% of ACWY-TT recipients, respectively and by 21.3% and 23.4% of Meningitec recipients, respectively. Only 4 grade 3 systemic solicited symptoms were reported: 2 subjects in the ACWY-TT group reported grade 3 irritability, and 2 subjects in the ACWY-TT group reported fever ≥ 39.5 ° C. No subjects in the Meningitec group reported grade 3 general solicited symptoms. At least one unsolicited symptom within the 31-day follow-up period considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination was reported by 19.3% of ACWY-TT recipients and by one subject (2.1%) in the Meningitec group. None of the related symptoms were of grade 3 intensity. The unsolicited symptoms reported by the ACWYTT group encompassed 9 MedDRA System Organ Classes and 26 Preferred Terms. Reactions occurring at the injection site accounted for more than half of the reports in the ACWY-TT group (57.4%, 27/47), as was the single causally-related adverse event reported in the Meningitec group. Gastrointestinal disorders were the second most frequently reported symptoms in the ACWY-TT group (16.1%, 9/56). Two subjects, both in the ACWY-TT group, reported SAEs during the study: one subject reported a limb injury with onset 24 days after vaccination and one subject reported an allergic reaction with onset 30 days after vaccination. Neither of the SAEs was considered by the investigator to be related to vaccination and both subjects recovered.

No deaths occurred during the study. No subjects were withdrawn from studies for safety reasons.

## 1.3.3. Discussion

The reactogenicity and safety profile of the booster dose of ACWY-TT was in line with the known safety profile as described in the SmPC. No changes to the safety information in the SmPC are considered necessary based on the data from study MenACWY-TT-048 EXT-039 Y4 and other date presented in this submission.

## 1.4. Changes to the Product Information

Following comments from the CHMP on the initial proposal (as discussed in detail above under Clinical Efficacy) the MAH provided a modified proposal for changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed. The changes are detailed in the attached Product Information.

In addition to changes discussed in this report, changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template, which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP.

In addition, editorial changes were made in SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

To summarise the antibody persistence data, while there are some discrepant findings between assays in some cases and some unexpected changes in titres (i.e. increases over time in populations in which marked natural boosting would not be expected), there are no major surprises from these data. Where comparisons with monovalent MenC conjugates or with unconjugated MenACWY are available, the data do not point to any likely important disadvantage for Nimenrix and in most cases suggest some advantage.

The new data on responses to a booster dose in Finnish children clearly add to the evidence that Nimenrix elicits a T-cell-dependent primary immune response that results in marked anamnestic responses to booster doses.

The issues raised by the CHMP during the assessment have been addressed. While there is ongoing investigation of potential rSBA-assay-related issues, the response provided regarding study 048 does suggest that perhaps the issue was not due to assay problems. Nevertheless, an increase in anti-MenA antibody would not be expected in Finnish children between Y3 and Y4 post-vaccination. MenA is not known to be circulating in this population but it remains possible that the observed data reflect crossantigenicity from another organism(s). Overall, it can be agreed that the data should be added to the SmPC with a footnote to mention the IgG data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As outlined in the recent assessment (Nimenrix Art 46-0050), data from Study MenACWY-TT-032 [EXT027] Y5 show better antibody persistence in children aged at least 2 years when they received a single dose of Nimenrix vs. those aged 1-&lt;2 years. Taken together, the Year 4-5 data point to the need to consider advising either 2 doses in the second year of life (an on-going study is examining this) or advising giving consideration to a booster dose within 4 years if priming occurred between the ages of 12 years. However, it does not seem appropriate to mandate either approach given the influence of the circumstances of use. The new warning in Section 4.4 addressing the uncertainties regarding longer-term protection that are raised by these data, and the updated data in Section 5.1 of the SmPC, are adequate to address this issue.

The benefit-risk profile of Nimenrix is unchanged by these data and remains positive.
