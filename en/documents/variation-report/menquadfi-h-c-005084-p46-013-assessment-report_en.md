## Methods

## Study participants

The study population included healthy male and female subjects aged 42 to 89 days on the day of the first visit. Subjects had not been previously vaccinated against meningococcal disease with either mono- or polyvalent polysaccharide, or conjugate meningococcal vaccine containing serogroups A, C, Y, or W, or meningococcal B serogroup vaccine, or any pneumococcal, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis A, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, Hib, and/or rotavirus vaccines. Subjects had to have received a first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at least 28 days prior to study enrollment.

Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the first study vaccination (except for monovalent pandemic influenza vaccines and multivalent influenza vaccines, which could be received at least 2 weeks before or 2 weeks after any study vaccination), or planned participation in another clinical study investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure at the time of enrollment or in the 4 weeks preceding the first study vaccination was not allowed.

## Treatments

All subjects were randomised into two groups. Each group was further randomised in 2 subgroups based on the time of analyses conducted in the second year of life (30 days after the 12-month vaccinations or 30 days after the 15-month vaccinations, respectively):

Group 1 (G1): MenACYW conjugate vaccine and routine paediatric vaccines:

- -Subgroup 1a (G1a) (12 months): MenACYW conjugate vaccine and routine vaccines at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age.
- -Subgroup 1b (G1b) (15 months): MenACYW conjugate vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 15 to 18 months of age and routine vaccines at 2, 4, 6, 12 to 15 months of age, and 15 to 18 months of age.

Group 2 (G2): MENVEO and routine paediatric vaccines

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Subgroup 2a (G2a) (12 months): MENVEO at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age and routine vaccines at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 15 to 18 months of age.
- -Subgroup 2b (G2b) (15 months): MENVEO at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age and routine vaccines at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 15 to 18 months of age.

All subjects received the following routine vaccines as per the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations:

- Pentacel (diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis [DTaP]-inactivated poliovirus vaccine [IPV]/Hib) at 2, 4, 6, and 15 to 18 months of age (Subjects in Subgroup 1a completed the last study visit at 13 to 16 months of age. For subjects in Subgroup 1a, the fourth dose of Pentacel, which was administered at 15 to 18 months of age, had to be provided by the Sponsor for completion of the DTaP series with vaccine from the same manufacturer, as per ACIP recommendation. The study personnel / Investigator was responsible for administering this dose at the recommended age outside of the scope of the study.)
- PREVNAR 13 (PCV13) at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age.
- RotaTeq (pentavalent rotavirus vaccine [RV5]) at 2, 4, and 6 months of age.
- ENGERIX-B (HB vaccine) at 2 and 6 months of age (First dose of hepatitis B vaccine was to be given at least 28 days prior to study enrollment).
- M-M-R II (measles, mumps, rubella [MMR] vaccine) at 12 to 15 months of age.
- VARIVAX (varicella vaccine) at 12 to 15 months of age.

In addition, subjects in Subgroup 1b and Group 2 received the 1st dose of hepatitis A (HepA) vaccine (HAVRIX) at 15 to 18 months of age as part of the study. For Subgroup 1a, there was no HepA vaccination provided as part of the study. Subjects in Subgroup 1a had to be vaccinated, as per standard practice, after the completion of the last study visit.

## Objectives

## Primary Objectives:

- 1) To demonstrate the non-inferiority (NI) of the serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA) vaccine seroresponse to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W following the administration of a 4-dose series of MenACYW conjugate vaccine compared to a 4-dose series of MENVEO when given concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines to infants and toddlers 6 weeks old to 15 months old.

hSBA vaccine seroresponse for serogroups A, C, Y, and W was defined as:

- For a subject with a pre-vaccination titer &lt; 1:8, the post-vaccination titer had to be ≥ 1:16
- For a subject with a pre-vaccination titer ≥ 1:8, the post-vaccination titer had to be ≥ 4-fold greater than the pre-vaccination titer
- 2) To demonstrate the NI of the hSBA antibody (Ab) response to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W following the administration of 3 doses in infancy of MenACYW conjugate vaccine compared to 3 doses in infancy of MENVEO when given concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines to infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary Objectives Immunogenicity

- 1) To demonstrate the NI of immune responses of the routine paediatric vaccines administered concomitantly with MenACYW conjugate vaccine as compared with MENVEO in infants and toddlers 6 weeks old to 18 months old.
- 2) To assess the Ab responses against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W after the administration of the 4th dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or MENVEO when both were given concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines at 12 months of age.
- 3) To assess the persistence of bactericidal Ab at 12 months of age in subjects who previously received 3 doses of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or MENVEO in infancy concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines at 2, 4, and 6 months of age.
- 4) To describe the Ab responses against the antigens of the routine paediatric vaccines (Pentacel, PREVNAR 13, M-M-R II, VARIVAX, RotaTeq, and ENGERIX-B) when administered concomitantly with either MenACYW conjugate vaccine or MENVEO.
- 5) To describe the Ab responses against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W when MenACYW conjugate vaccine vs MENVEO was administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines.
- 6) To describe the Ab responses against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W when MenACYW conjugate vaccine was administered to children 12 to 15 months of age vs when MenACYW conjugate vaccine was administered to children 15 to 18 months of age, concomitantly with routine pAediatric vaccines (Subgroup 1a vs Subgroup 1b), including the bactericidal antibodies persistence and the effect of 4th dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine at 12 to 15 months of age or 15 to 18 months of age.

## Observational Objectives Safety

To describe the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and MENVEO when administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines in healthy infants and toddlers.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

from the study, of any unsolicited systemic adverse events (AEs) reported in the 30 minutes after each vaccination.

- Occurrence, time of onset, number of days of occurrence, intensity, action taken, and whether the reaction led to early termination from the study, of solicited (prelisted in the subject ' s diary card and electronic case report book [CRB] injection site reactions occurring up to D07 after each vaccination.
- Occurrence, time of onset, number of days of occurrence, intensity, action taken, and whether the reaction led to early termination from the study, of solicited (prelisted in the subject ' s diary card and CRB) systemic reactions occurring up to D07 after each vaccination.
- Occurrence, nature (MedDRA preferred term), time of onset, duration, intensity, action taken, relationship to vaccination, and whether the event led to early termination from the study, of unsolicited AEs up to D30 after each vaccination.
- Occurrence, nature (MedDRA preferred term), time of onset, duration, seriousness criteria, relationship to vaccination, outcome, and whether the event led to early termination from the study, of serious AEs (SAEs) (including adverse events of special interest [AESIs]) throughout the trial from Visit 1 to the 6-month follow-up contact after the last vaccination.

## Sample size

Approximately 2628 subjects were planned to be enrolled. An estimated maximum of up to 34.1% non-evaluable subjects resulted in approximately 1732 subjects in the per-protocol analysis set (PPAS) available for immunogenicity analyses (1155 evaluable subjects in Group 1 and 577 in Group 2).

In case of unexpected situation or any study hold resulting in an unexpected number of unevaluable subjects, total sample size was to be increased to replace withdrawn, or unevaluable subjects.

- Group 2 (G2): MENVEO and routine pediatric vaccines

Each group was further randomized 2:1 in 2 subgroups based on the time of analyses conducted in the 2nd year of life (30 days after the 12-month vaccinations or 30 days after the 15-month vaccinations, respectively):

## Group 1:

- -Subgroup 1a (G1a) (12 months*): MenACYW conjugate vaccine and routine vaccines at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age
- -Subgroup 1b (G1b) (15 months*): MenACYW conjugate vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 15 to 18 months of age and routine vaccines at 2, 4, 6, 12 to 15 months of age, and 15 to 18 months of age

## Group 2:

## Primary hypothesis 1 (seroresponse after the 4th dose)

Thirty days after the administration of the 4th dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine at 12 to 15 months of age or MENVEO at 12 months of age, the percentages of subjects who achieved an hSBA seroresponse* for meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W in Subgroup 1a were non-inferior to the corresponding percentages in Subgroup 2a.

- -Null hypothesis (H0): p(men, G1a) - p(men, G2a) ≤ - 10%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Alternative hypothesis (H1): p(men, G1a) - p(men, G2a) &gt; - 10%

where p(men, G1a) and p(men, G2a) were the percentages of subjects who achieved hSBA vaccine seroresponse in Subgroup 1a and Subgroup 2a, respectively. Each of the serogroups A, C, Y, and W was tested separately. If the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between the 2 proportions was &gt; - 10% for each serogroup, the inferiority assumption was rejected. For each of the 4 non-inferiority (NI) hypotheses using the vaccine seroresponse rates, the CI of the difference in proportions was computed using the Wilson Score method without continuity correction.

The overall NI of this objective was demonstrated if all 4 individual null hypotheses were rejected.

*hSBA vaccine seroresponse for serogroups A, C, Y and W was defined as:

- For a subject with a pre-vaccination titer &lt; 1:8, the post-vaccination titer should be ≥ 1:16
- For a subject with a pre-vaccination titer ≥ 1:8, the post-vaccination titer should be ≥ 4-fold greater than the pre-vaccination titer

## Primary hypothesis 2 (Ab titer ≥ 1:8 after the 3rd dose)

Thirty days after the administration of the 3rd dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or MENVEO at 6 months of age, the percentages of subjects who achieved hSBA ≥ 1:8 for meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W in Group 1 were non-inferior to the corresponding percentages in Group 2.

- Alternative hypothesis (H1): p(men, G1) - p(men, G2) &gt; - 10%

where p(men, G1) and p(men, G2) were the percentages of subjects who achieved hSBA ≥ 1:8 in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. Each of the serogroups A, C, Y, and W was tested separately.

All immunogenicity analysis were descriptive. In general, categorical variables were summarized and presented by frequency counts, proportion percentages and CIs. The 95% CIs of point estimates were calculated using the normal approximation for quantitative data and the exact binomial distribution (Clopper-Pearson method) for proportions. For geometric mean titers (GMTs) and GMCs, 95% CIs of point estimates were calculated using normal approximation assuming they are log-normally distributed.

The summary of NI hypothesis for the secondary objectives is presented in Table 4.

## Efficacy/Immunogenicity results

## Co-primary Immunogenicity Objective #1

The co-primary objective #1 was to demonstrate the NI of the hSBA vaccine seroresponse to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W following the administration of a 4-dose series of MenACYW conjugate vaccine compared to a 4-dose series of MENVEO when given concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines to infants and toddlers 6 weeks of age to 15 months of age.

The NI of hSBA vaccine seroresponse rate at D30 after the 4th dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine administered at 12 to 15 months of age (Group 1a) or MENVEO administered at 12 months of age (Group 2a) in the PPAS3 is presented in Table 10.

The co-primary objective #1 was met. At D30 after the 4th dose, the NI of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1a) compared to MENVEO (Group 2a) was demonstrated in the PPAS3 as the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in the proportion of subjects with an hSBA seroresponse rate for meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y was greater than -10%.

At D30 after the 4th dose in the PPAS3, the hSBA vaccine seroresponse rates were:

- for serogroup A: 79.4% in Group 1a and 77.6% in Group 2a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- for serogroup C: 97.0% in Group 1a and 88.2% in Group 2a
- for serogroup Y: 96.4% in Group 1a and 92.3% in Group 2a

## Co-primary Immunogenicity Objective #2

The co-primary objective #2 was to demonstrate the NI of the hSBA Ab response to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W following the administration of 3 doses in infancy of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1) compared to 3 doses in infancy of MENVEO (Group 2) when given concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines to infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age.

The NI of the percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 1:8 at D30 after the 3rd dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1) or MENVEO (Group 2) administered at 6 months of age in the PPAS1 is presented in Table 11.

The co-primary objective #2 was met. At D30 after the 3rd dose, the NI of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1) compared to MENVEO (Group 2) was demonstrated in the PPAS1 as the lower limit of the 95% CI of the difference in the proportion of subjects who achieved hSBA titers ≥ 1:8 for serogroups A, C, W, and Y was greater than -10%.

At D30 after the 3rd dose, the percentages of subjects with hSBA antibody titers ≥ 1:8 were:

- for serogroup A: 77.9% in Group 1 and 67.7% in Group 2
- for serogroup C: 99.0% in Group 1 and 91.2% in Group 2
- for serogroup Y: 98.3% in Group 1 and 91.7% in Group 2
- for serogroup W: 98.6% in Group 1 and 92.9% in Group 2

The NI was also demonstrated in the FAS1.

## Secondary Objective #1: Non-Inferiority of Routine Pediatric Vaccines Administered Concomitantly With MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine or MENVEO

The secondary objective #1 was met: the NI of immune responses of the routine pediatric vaccines administered concomitantly with MenACYW conjugate vaccine as compared with MENVEO in infants and toddlers 6 weeks old to 18 months old was demonstrated (Table 12).

The NI was also demonstrated for all antigens in the FAS1 and in the FAS3.

## Safety results

Safety data were collected as follows:

- -immediate unsolicited systemic AEs within 30 minutes of each vaccination,
- -solicited AEs from D0 to D07 after each vaccination,
- -unsolicited AEs from D0 to D30 after each vaccination and
- -SAE (including AESIs and MAAEs) throughout the study from Visit 1 until the end of the 6month follow-up period after the last vaccination.

## Overall population (overall SafAS)

In the overall SafAS after any vaccination, there were 1 subject (&lt; 0.1%) in Group 1 (infantile spitting up) and 1 subject (0.1%) in Group 2 (rash) with at least 1 immediate unsolicited AE within 30 minutes of any vaccination. None were assessed as related to study vaccine by the Investigator in any group.

## Solicited reactions

The proportion of subjects who experienced at least 1 solicited injection site reaction after any vaccination was 78.0% in Group 1 and 79.8% in Group 2. After any vaccination with MenACYW conjugate vaccine or MENVEO, there were 71.7% of subjects in Group 1 and 71.0% of subjects in

## Narratives

- One subject in Group 1b (full-term birth status) experienced a Grade 3 febrile convulsions. The event started 13 days after the 15-month vaccinations (4th dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine administered concomitantly with Pentacel and HAVRIX), required health care contact and medication and resolved the same day. The event did not lead to study discontinuation. The event was reported with 3 concomitant non study vaccine related events: Grade 1 otitis media right ear, Grade 1 bronchiolitis and pyrexia. The subject experienced a total of 4 events of febrile convulsions, all of Grade 3 while enrolled in the study. Only the 3rd episode was reported by the Investigator as related to the investigational vaccine administered concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines; however, the event likely may have been related to acute concomitant infections (otitis media and bronchiolitis), and therefore was assessed as unrelated to study vaccine by the Sponsor. The event was reported as an AESI.
- One subject in Group 2b (full-term birth status) experienced a Grade 2 pyrexia which was reported by the Investigator as post-vaccinations fever. The event started 8 hours following the 2-month vaccinations (1st dose of MENVEO administered concomitantly with Pentacel, Prevnar 13, RotaTeq, and ENGERIX-B), required hospitalization and resolved 3 days later. The event did not lead to study discontinuation. The event was neither an AESI nor a MAAE.

One death occurred during the study, including the 6-month follow-up period. A cardiac arrest with fatal outcome was reported for 1 infant in Group 1 (full-term birth status) 6 days after the 2-month vaccinations (1st dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine administered concomitantly with Pentacel, Prevnar 13, RotaTeq, and ENGERIX B). This event was assessed as unrelated to the investigational vaccine administered concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines. The event was neither an AESI nor a MAAE. The subject was discontinued from the trial due to the SAE.

## Other results:

- The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic situation was assessed as negligeable.
- Subgroup analyses per gender and race did not reveal any difference.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Subgroup analyses per birth status at baseline did not show any differences of immunogenicity and safety results between preterm and full-term subjects (details are provided below).

## Subgroup Analysis by Preterm and Full-term Birth Status - Immunogenicity

Additional descriptive immunogenicity data and analyses per birth status at baseline following the administration of MenACYW conjugate vaccine are presented in this section. The analyses are based on the following numbers of subjects in Group 1:

- 66 preterm subjects and 861 full-term subjects in the PPAS1
- 71 preterm subjects and 871 full-term subjects in the PPAS2
- 61 preterm subjects and 922 full-term subjects in the PPAS3

Overall, the immunogenicity results between preterm and full-term subjects in Group 1 were comparable.

## Subgroup Analysis by Preterm and Full-term Birth Status - Safety

A safety overview after any vaccine injections (overall SafAS) by preterm and full-term birth within Group 1 is presented Table 35. In the overall SafAS for any dose, a total of 133 preterm and 1593 fullterm subjects were included in Group 1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No preterm subject reported an immediate unsolicited AE or an immediate unsolicited AR. One fullterm subject (&lt; 0.1%; infantile spitting up) reported an immediate unsolicited AE which was not assessed as an immediate AR.

A comparable proportion of preterm and full-term subjects experienced at least 1 solicited injection site reaction (69.8% and 78.7%, respectively). A total of 64.3% of preterm subjects and 72.3% of fullterm subjects had a least 1 solicited injection site reaction after any injection of MenACYW conjugate vaccine.

A comparable proportion of preterm and full-term subjects experienced at least 1 solicited systemic reaction within 7 days after any vaccine injection (73.8% and 80.5%, respectively).

A comparable proportion of preterm and full-term subjects had at least 1 unsolicited AE (47.4% and 54.4%, respectively) and at least 1 unsolicited AR (2.3% and 5.7%, respectively).

No preterm subject reported an AE leading to study discontinuation; there was 1 (&lt; 0.1%) out of 1593 full-term subjects.

During the study including the 6-month follow-up period, a total of 10 preterm subjects (7.5%) and 89 full-term subjects (5.6%) experienced at least 1 SAE. There were 1 preterm subject (0.8%) and 12 full-term subjects (0.8%) with at least 1 AESI. A comparable proportion of preterm and full-term subjects reported at least 1 MAAE (55.6% and 61.3%, respectively).

One death was reported in the full-term group (cardiac arrest after the 2-month vaccinations not related to study vaccine).

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Study MET42 was a Phase III, partially modified double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, active controlled, multi-center study to compare the immunogenicity and describe the safety of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and MENVEO (Meningococcal [Serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135] Oligosaccharide Diphtheria CRM197 Conjugate Vaccine) when administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines to healthy infants and toddlers in the US.

The MAH intends to submit the presented data together with data from four other studies in a future variation procedure to support the extension of indication for use of MenQuadfi in individuals from the age of 6 weeks and older. The study population of MET42 included healthy male and female subjects aged 42 to 89 days on the day of the 1st visit, which is considered appropriate to support the intended extension of indication.

For this population a variety of vaccinations are recommended during the first two years of age. The study included concomitant vaccinations with Pentacel (diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis [DTaP]inactivated poliovirus vaccine [IPV]/Hib vaccine), Prevnar13 (PCV13; pneumococcal vaccine), RotaTeq (rotavirus vaccine), ENGERIX-B (HB vaccine), M-M-R II (measles, mumps, rubella vaccine), VARIVAX (varicella vaccine) and HAVRIX (hepatitis A vaccine). The study was performed in the US and the infant vaccines and their respective schedules are partly representative to recommended infant vaccinations in the EU. In EU, for infants a hexavalent vaccine is usually recommended also including a HepB component. Pentacel is not approved in EU. Although differences to the EU recommendations exist, the results are considered relevant for the EU population.

The proposed objectives are informative for the intended indication and the chosen endpoints and intended analyses are considered appropriate. The sample size is sufficient to perform the intended NIanalyses with sufficient power. The randomization and blinding procedures are acceptable.

In total 2628 subjects were enrolled and 1953 completed the study. The dataset for the evaluation of the immune response to the 4 th  dose included 1417 subjects (53.9%). The majority of subjects were excluded from the analysis because a valid blood samples/result could not be obtained. The percentage of excluded subjects is similar in all groups but slightly more in the Menveo group. While the reported numbers do not give rise to concerns per se, the Applicant should discuss this also in context with results from other studies at the time of the intended extension of indications. The safety set including subjects that received all 4 vaccinations either with MenACYW or Menveo included 2080 (79.2%) subjects. The percentage of excluded subjects is similar for both groups. The respective dataset is considered sufficient to assess safety in the enrolled population.

## Immunogenicity

Immunogenicity was assessed at D0 before the first and 4th dose and 30 days after the 3rd and 4th dose. These timepoints are clinically relevant and are acceptable.

The two co-primary immunogenicity objectives of the study were met:

· The NI of hSBA seroresponses to meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y when 4 doses of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age) were administered concomitantly with pediatric routine vaccines compared to 4 doses of MENVEO with pediatric routine vaccines, was demonstrated. The seroresponse rates were 79.4% for serogroup A and above 96% for serogroups C, Y and W.

· The NI of the percentage of subjects with hSBA Ab titers ≥ 1:8 for meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W 30 days after the administration of the last of 3 doses of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (at 2, 4, and 6 months of age) compared to 3 doses of MENVEO when given concomitantly with pediatric

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

routine vaccines to infants and toddlers at 6 to 7 months of age, was demonstrated. The percentages of subjects with hSBA antibody titers ≥ 1:8 were 77.9% for serogroup A and above 98% for serogroups C, Y and W.

For both timepoints the results are numerically higher for MenACYW compared to Menveo.

The Applicant further provided six secondary objectives to further characterize the antibody response of the investigational product MenACYW and the concomitant vaccinations.

In order to further characterize the results after the 4 th  dose (at 12 months of age, corresponding to PEP 1), geometric mean of hSBA titers (GMTs) against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W at D0 and D30 after the 4th dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine were provided. At both timepoints the reported GMTs were higher in subjects vaccinated with MenACYW compared to Menveo for serogroups C, Y and W and comparable for serogroup A. This is also reflected in the percentages of subjects with ≥ 4-fold rise of hSBA titer from pre-4th dose to post-4th dose. Overall, the results are comparable but slightly lower for MenACYW, which can be explained with the higher pre-dose GMTs observed for MenACYW. Nevertheless, both groups showed a high percentages of subjects with ≥ 4-fold rise of hSBA titer . These results also demonstrate the persistence of the immune response elicited by both vaccines, which was higher with MenACYW compared to Menveo. To further support the persistence the Applicant also presented the percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8 at D0 before the 4 th  dose. Those were consistently higher in subjects who received MenACYW compared to Menveo.

Similarly to the data presented for the 4 th  dose, the Applicant presented data to further characterize the response after the 3 rd  dose (at 6 months of age, corresponding to PEP 2). The presented GMTs were higher in subjects vaccinated with MenACYW compared to Menveo for all serogroups. The percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 1:4 was comparable for all serogroups.

Further support for the comparable or higher immune response of MenACYW compared to Menveo was provided by further hSBA seroresponse data at different timepoints, hSBA Ab titers distribution and RCDC. All presented data support the results discussed above.

As additional aspect the Applicant included (secondary objective #6) a comparison of the antibody responses after the 4 th  dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine administered at 12 or at 15 months of age (6 months or 9 months after the 3 rd  dose). The group who received the 4th dose at 15 months of age showed higher (serogroup Y and W) or comparable (serogroup A and C) hSBA GMTs at D30 after the 4th dose. At D30 after the 3 rd  dose, GMTS were comparable between both groups.

Similarly, comparable results were reported with hSBA antibody titers ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8, seroresponse and the percentage of subjects with ≥ 4 -fold rise of hSBA titer both from pre-1st dose to post-4th dose vaccinations and the pre-4th dose to post-4th dose vaccinations.

The Applicant further reported GMTs before the 4 th  dose at 12 and 15 months of age. The reported GMTs were comparable for serogroup A, Y and W but lower for serogroup C in the group with the 4 th dose at 15 months of age. It is assumed the Applicant plans to include a respective claim that a later administration of the 4 th  dose is possible in the extension of indication variation. The Applicant is therefore advised to add a thorough discussion, why this difference does not present an increased risk in the additional three months for children, who receive the 4 th  dose at 15 months of age.

The NI of immune responses of the routine paediatric vaccines administered concomitantly with MenACYW conjugate vaccine as compared to MENVEO in infants and toddlers 6 weeks old to 18 months was demonstrated. The Applicant performed tests for NI at different timepoint for different vaccines, which are all acceptable. At D30 after the 6-month vaccinations, NI was demonstrated for vaccinations against Hepatitis B, PRP, Polio, Rotavirus, Pertussis and pneumococcal serotypes. At D30 after the 12-month vaccinations NI was demonstrated for Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pneumococcal serotypes. At D30 after the 15 month-vaccinations NI was demonstrated for PRP, Polia and Pertussis. The provided data even show numerically higher responses in the group receiving MenACYW for many comparisons. In addition, the Applicant provided the respective antibody concentrations/titer and the number of subjects reaching a respective threshold for each of the evaluated vaccines at each timepoint. These data confirm the comparable results between groups vaccinated with MenACYW and Menveo. Only slight differences have been observed, but mainly in numerically higher results in the MenACYW groups.

Overall, it can be concluded that the immune response of the concomitant pediatric vaccines is comparable in the groups receiving MenACYW or Menveo.

## Safety

Safety was evaluated as observational objective, which is acceptable. The Applicant distinguished between immediate unsolicited systemic AEs within 30 minutes of each vaccination, solicited AEs from D0 to D07 after each vaccination, unsolicited AEs from D0 to D30 after each vaccination and SAE (including AESIs and MAAEs) throughout the study from Visit 1 until the end of the 6-month follow-up period after the last vaccination. This separation is considered clinically meaningful and is therefore supported.

The Applicant provided the results for the overall study as well as separated for different safety datasets corresponding the different doses. This allows a more detailed assessment of the safety data, which is appreciated.

Overall, the safety profiles of MenACYW and Menveo given concomitantly with other infant vaccines were comparable in all safety datasets.

Immediate unsolicited AEs within 30 minutes occurred only in 2 subjects (1 in the MenACYW and 1 in the Menveo group) during the study. None was related to the vaccines.

Solicited injection site reactions within 7 days following injection were reported in about 78% of subjects in both groups. About 80% reported with solicited systemic reactions. The most frequently reported solicited injection site reactions were tenderness, erythema and swelling. The most frequently reported solicited systemic reactions were irritability, crying abnormal, drowsiness, appetite lost, fever, and vomiting. Most solicited injection site and systemic reactions started within D0 to D3, resolved (spontaneously) after 1-3 days and were of Grade 1 or 2 intensity. For MenACYW conjugate vaccine or MENVEO, about 9% of subjects in each group experienced at least 1 Grade 3 solicited injection site reaction predominantly consisting of tenderness in both groups. At least 1 Grade 3 solicited systemic reaction was reported by ~18% of subjects in both groups predominantly consisting of irritability in both groups.

Unsolicited AEs were reported for about 54% of subjects in both groups and about 6% reported at least 1 unsolicited adverse reaction (AR). Unsolicited AEs were mainly reported in the SOCs: 'Infections and infestations', 'General disorders and administration site conditions' and 'Gastrointestinal disorders'. The most frequently reported events were upper respiratory tract infection and injection site bruising.

One subject in the MenACYW and one subject in the Menveo group discontinued due to an AE. Both were not considered to be related to study drug.

The percentage of subjects that experienced serious AEs (within 30 days: ~2%; 6 months follow up: ~5%), AESIs (within 30 days: &lt;0.2%; 6 months follow up: &lt;0.8%) and MAAEs (within 30 days: ~40%; 6 months follow up: ~60%) was also comparable between the MenACYW and Menveo groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most frequently reported SAEs were Febrile convulsion, Bronchiolitis and other infections and infection related AEs.

Two SAEs were assessed as related to study vaccine during the study including the 6-month follow-up period. Both cases occurred within 30 days of vaccination: 1 case of febrile convulsions in Group 1 (assessed as related to study vaccine by the Investigator and as unrelated to study vaccine by the Sponsor). The Sponsor's conclusion that the event is likely to be related to acute concomitant infections can be followed. And 1 case of post-vaccination fever in Group 2 (assessed as related to study vaccine by both the Investigator and the Sponsor). The event occurred 8h after the subject received the study vaccines. The assessment as related to the received vaccines can be followed. However, the event is a known AEs for the administered vaccines and does not represent any new safety signal.

One death occurred during the study. A cardiac arrest with fatal outcome was reported in Group 1 6 days after the 2-month vaccinations (1st dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine administered concomitantly with Pentacel, Prevnar 13, RotaTeq, and ENGERIX B). This event was assessed as unrelated to the investigational vaccine administered concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines. The MAH's conclusion that the event was not related to the drug can be followed.

Differences between time points were observed but were similar between groups and do not raise concerns.

Overall, the reported safety profile seems manageable and no new safety signals were identified. As far as applicable, the safety profile is comparable to the safety profile reported in older children as assessed during the initial MAA.

The MAH provided additional subgroup analyses for immunogenicity for gender and race, which did not reveal any difference. Further subgroup analyses of immunogenicity and safety for pre- and full-term infants showed comparable results.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

In study MET42 comparable or higher immune response of MenACYW when administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines was observed compared to Menveo when administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines. In addition, it can be concluded that the immune response of the concomitant paediatric vaccines is comparable in the groups receiving MenACYW or Menveo.

The reported safety profile is manageable and no new safety signals were identified. As far as applicable, the safety profile is comparable to the safety profile reported in older children as assessed during the initial MAA.

Currently other studies in this population are still ongoing. The MAH's plan to complete these studies and to submit all the data together under a type II variation with Product Information (PI) update to support the extension of indication for use of MenQuadfi in individuals from the age of 6 weeks and older is supported. Since this submission is planned in Q1 2025 in EU, this is acceptable and no immediate changes to the PI are warranted. For the planned procedure, the MAH is advised to discuss any differences between studies.
