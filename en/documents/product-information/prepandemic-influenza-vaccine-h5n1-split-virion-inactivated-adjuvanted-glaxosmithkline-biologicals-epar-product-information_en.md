## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

After mixing, 1 dose (0.5 ml) contains:

Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg should be used in accordance with official guidance.

Split influenza virus inactivated, containing antigen * equivalent to: A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) like strain used (NIBRG-14) 3.75 micrograms * propagated in eggs ** haemagglutinin AS03 adjuvant composed of squalene (10.69 milligrams), DLα -tocopherol (11.86 milligrams) and polysorbate 80 (4.86 milligrams) The suspension and emulsion vials once mixed form a multidose container. See section 6.5 for the number of doses per vial. Excipients: It contains 5 micrograms thiomersal For a full list of excipients see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection. The suspension is a colourless light opalescent liquid. The emulsion is a whitish homogeneous liquid. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Active immunisation against H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus. This indication is based on immunogenicity data from healthy subjects from the age of 18 years onwards following administration of two doses of vaccine prepared from A/VietNam/1194/2004 NIBRG-14 (H5N1) (see section 5.1).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

Adults from the age of 18 years: One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. A second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least three weeks.

**

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on very limited data, adults aged &gt;80 years may require a double dose of Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg on an elected date and again after an interval of at least three weeks in order to achieve an immune response (see section 5.1).

A complete vaccination course with Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg consists of two doses.  However, in the event of an officially declared influenza pandemic, persons previously vaccinated with one or two doses of Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg that contained HA antigen derived from a different clade of the same influenza subtype as the pandemic influenza strain may receive a single dose of Pandemrix instead of two doses that are required in previously unvaccinated individuals.

There is no experience in children. For further information, see sections 4.4 and 5.1. Method of administration Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection. If a double dose is given, the injections should be given into opposite limbs. 4.3 Contraindications History of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues (egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate and sodium deoxycholate) of this vaccine. See sections 4.4, 4.8 and 6.1. Acute severe febrile illness.  Immunisation should be postponed. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Caution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients, to thiomersal and to residues (egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate and sodium deoxycholate). As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally. There are no data on administration of AS03-adjuvanted vaccines before or following other types of influenza vaccines intended for pre-pandemic or pandemic use.

Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient.

A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1).

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

The vaccine should not usually be given at the same time as other vaccines.  However, if coadministration with another vaccine is considered to be essential, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment.

Following influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA method for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, HTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative.  These transitory false-positive results may be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine.

## 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation

No data have been generated in pregnant women with Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg or with any other vaccine that contains the AS03 adjuvant.

Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility, pregnancy, embryonic/fetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). Healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine to pregnant women taking into consideration official recommendations. There are no data regarding the use of Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg during lactation. The potential benefits to the mother and risks to the infant should be considered before administering Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg during lactation. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 'Undesirable Effects' may affect the ability to drive or operate machinery. 4.8 Undesirable effects · Clinical trials Clinical studies have evaluated the incidence of adverse reactions listed below in approximately 5,000 subjects 18 years old and above who received formulations containing at least 3.75 microgram HA/AS03. Adverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency: Very common ( ≥ 1/10) Common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10) Uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100) Rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000) Very rare (&lt;1/10,000) Medicinal product no longer authorised

3 seroconversion factor: ratio of the post-vaccination geometric mean titre (GMT) and the prevaccination GMT.

3 seroconversion factor: ratio of the post-vaccination geometric mean titre (GMT) and the prevaccination GMT. After two doses given 21 days or 6 months apart, 96.0% of subjects had a 4-fold increase in serum neutralising antibody titres and 98-100% had a titre of at least 1:80. Follow up of 50 subjects aged 18-60 years who had received two doses of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 at 0 and 21 days showed that 84% were seroprotected (HI titre ≥ 1:40) at day 42 compared with 54% at day 180. A 4-fold increase in serum neutralising antibody titres from day 0 was observed in 85.7% at day 42 and 72% at day 180. In another clinical study, 152 subjects aged &gt; 60 years (stratified in ranges from 61 to 70, 71 to 80 and &gt; 80 years of age) received either a single or a double dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) at 0 and 21 days. At day 42, the anti-HA antibody responses were as follows: 1 seroprotection rate: proportion of subjects with haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre ≥ 1:40; 2 seroconversion rate: proportion of subjects who were either seronegative at pre-vaccination and have a protective post-vaccination titre of ≥ 1:40, or who were seropositive at pre-vaccination and have a 4fold increase in titre; Medicinal product no longer authorised

Although an adequate immune response was achieved at day 42 following two administrations of a single dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1), a higher response was observed following two administrations of a double dose of vaccine.

Very limited data in seronegative subjects &gt;80 years of age (N=5) showed that no subject achieved seroprotection following two administrations of a single dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1). However, following two administrations of a double dose of vaccine, the seroprotection rate at day 42 was 75%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The day 180 seroprotection rates in subjects aged &gt;60 years were 52.9% for those who received two single doses and 69.5% of subjects for those who had received two double doses at day 0 and day 21.

In addition,  44.8% and 56.1% of subjects in respective dose groups had a 4-fold increase in serum neutralising antibody titres from day 0 to day 42 and 96.6% and 100% of subjects had a titre of at least 1:80 at day 42.

One dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Indonesia/05/2005 administered after one or two doses of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004.

Anti-HA responses against A/Indonesia/5/2005 following administration of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were as follows: 1 seroprotection rate: proportion of subjects with haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre ≥ 1:40; 2 seroconversion rate: proportion of subjects who were either seronegative at pre-vaccination and have a protective post-vaccination titre of ≥ 1:40, or who were seropositive at pre-vaccination and have a 4fold increase in titre; 3 seroconversion factor: ratio of the post-vaccination geometric mean titre (GMT) and the prevaccination GMT. A 4-fold increase in serum neutralising antibody against A/Indonesia/5/2005 was achieved in &gt;90% of subjects after two doses regardless of the schedule. After two doses administered 6 months apart all subjects had a titre of at least 1:80. In a different study in 50 subjects aged 18-60 years the anti-HA antibody seroprotection rates 21 days after the second dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA  derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were 20% against A/Indonesia/5/2005, 35% against A/Anhui/01/2005 and 60% against A/Turkey/Turkey/1/2005. In 152 subjects aged &gt; 60 years the anti-HA antibody seroprotection and seroconversion rates against A/Indonesia/5/2005  at  day  42  after  two  doses  of  AS03-adjuvanted  vaccine  containing  3.75  µg  HA derived  from  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  were  23%  and  the  seroconversion  factor  was  2.7.  Neutralising antibody titres of at least 1:40 or at least 1:80 were achieved in 87% and 67%, respectively, of the 87 subjects tested. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In a clinical study, subjects aged 18-60 years received a dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from either A/Vietnam/1194/2004 or Indonesia/5/2005 six months after they had received one or two priming doses of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 on day 0 or on days 0 and 21 respectively.

1 seroprotection rate: proportion of subjects with haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre ≥ 1:40;

2 booster seroconversion rate: proportion of subjects who were either seronegative at pre-booster and have a protective post-vaccination titre of ≥ 1:40, or who were seropositive at pre-booster and have a 4fold increase in titre;

3 booster factor: ratio of the post-booster geometric mean titre (GMT) and the pre-booster GMT. Regardless of whether one or two doses of priming vaccine had been given 6 months earlier, the seroprotection rates against A/Indonesia were &gt;80% after a dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and the seroprotection rates against A/Vietnam were &gt;90% after a dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Indonesia/05/2005. All subjects achieved a neutralising antibody titre of at least 1:80 against each of the two strains regardless of the HA type in the vaccine and the previous number of doses. In another clinical study, 39 subjects aged 18-60 years received a dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Indonesia/5/2005 fourteen months after they had received two doses of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 administered on day 0 and day 21.  The seroprotection rate against A/Indonesia 21 days after booster vaccination was 92% and 69.2% at day 180. Information from non-clinical studies: The ability to induce protection against homologous and heterologous vaccine strains was assessed non-clinically using ferret challenge models. In each experiment, four groups of six ferrets were immunized intramuscularly with an AS03 adjuvanted vaccine containing HA derived from H5N1/A/Vietnam/1194/04 (NIBRG-14). Doses of 15, 5, 1.7 or 0.6 micrograms of HA were tested in the homologous challenge experiment, and doses of 15, 7.5, 3.8 or 1.75 micrograms of HA were tested in the heterologous challenge experiment. Control groups included ferrets immunized with adjuvant alone, non-adjuvanted vaccine (15 micrograms HA) or phosphate buffered saline solution. Ferrets were vaccinated on days 0 and 21 and challenged by the intra-tracheal route on day 49 with a lethal dose of either H5N1/A/Vietnam/1194/04 or heterologous H5N1/A/Indonesia/5/05. Of the animals receiving adjuvanted vaccine, 87% and 96% were protected against the lethal homologous or heterologous challenge, respectively. Viral shedding into the upper respiratory tract was also reduced in vaccinated animals relative to controls, suggesting a reduced risk of viral transmission. In the unadjuvanted control group, as well as in the adjuvant control group, all animals died or had to be euthanized as they were moribund, three to four days after the start of challenge. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## PSURs

Outside of the pandemic period, the normal PSUR periodicity and format will be maintained.

PSUR submission when Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg is used during the influenza pandemic:

During a pandemic situation, the frequency of submission of periodic safety update reports specified in Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 will not be adequate for the safety monitoring of a pandemic vaccine for which high levels of exposure are expected within a short period of time.  Such situation requires rapid notification of safety information that may have the greatest implications for risk-benefit balance in a pandemic.  Prompt analysis of cumulative safety information, in light of extent of exposure, will be crucial for regulatory decisions and protection of the population to be vaccinated.  In addition, duration a pandemic, resources needed for an in-depth evaluation of Periodic Safety Update Reports in the format as defined in Volume 9a of the Rules Governing Medicinal Product in the European Union may not be adequate for a rapid identification of a new safety issue.

<!-- image -->

In  consequence,  as  soon  as  the  pandemic  is  declared  (Phase  6  of  the  WHO  global  Influenza preparedness  plan)  and  the  prepandemic  vaccine  is  used,  the  MAH  shall  submit  more  frequent simplified  periodic  safety  update  reports  with  a  format  and  a  periodicity  defined  in  the  \"CHMP Recommendations for the Core Risk Management Plan for Influenza Vaccines prepared from viruses with  the  potential  to  cause  a  pandemic  and  intended  for  use  outside  of  the  core  dossier  context\" (EMEA/49993/2008), and any subsequent update. Official batch release: in accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, the official batch release will be undertaken by a state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose.

It is intended to be given before or during the next influenza (flu) pandemic to prevent flu caused by the H5N1 type of the virus. Pandemic flu is a type of influenza that occurs at intervals that vary from less than 10 years to many decades. It spreads rapidly around the world. The symptoms of pandemic flu are similar to those of ordinary flu but are usually more severe. When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defence system) will produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.  None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. As with all vaccines, Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals 3.75 µg may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated.
