## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Internal Doc Ref: v6.6

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Namuscla 167 mg hard capsules

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each capsule contains mexiletine hydrochloride corresponding to 166.62 mg mexiletine.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Hard capsule (capsule).

Namuscla capsules are Swedish orange hard shell gelatin capsules (20 mm) filled with white powder.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Namuscla is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of myotonia in adult patients with nondystrophic myotonic disorders.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Before starting mexiletine treatment,

- Detailed and careful cardiac evaluation should be carried out by cardiologist; throughout treatment with mexiletine, cardiac monitoring needs to be continued and adapted as a function of the heart condition of the patient (see ections 4.3 4.4).
- Electrolytic evaluation should be done prior to initiating therapy with mexiletine in every patient and any electrolyte imbalance needs to be corrected before administering mexiletine (see section 4.4)

## Posology

The recommended starting dose of mexiletine is 167 mg daily (1 capsule per day). After at least 1 week of treatment, based on the clinical response, the daily dose can be increased to 333 mg daily (2 capsules per day). After at least 1 further week of treatment, based on clinical response, dose can be further increased to 500 mg daily (3 capsules per day).

Maintenance treatment is between 167 mg - 500 mg daily (1 to 3 capsules per day) according to the intensity of symptoms and the clinical response, taken regularly throughout the day as required.

The dose should not exceed 500 mg/day. Regular reassessment should be implemented: discontinue long-term treatment in a patient not responding or not experiencing benefit of the treatment.

In case of modification of the mexiletine dose, or if medicinal products likely to affect cardiac conduction are co-administered with mexiletine, patients should be closely monitored by ECG (especially patients with conduction anomalies) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).

## Elderly

Experience with mexiletine in patients with myotonic disorders aged ≥ 65 years is limited. Based on the pharmacokinetic properties of mexiletine, no dose adjustment is required in patients aged 65 years and over.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Internal Doc Ref: v6.6

## Hepatic impairment

Mexiletine should be used with caution in patients with mild (5-6 Child-Pugh score) or moderate (7-9 Child-Pugh score) hepatic impairment. In these patients, it is recommended that the dose should only be increased after at least 2 weeks of treatment.

The experience with mexiletine in patients with severe hepatic impairment is limited. Therefore, mexiletine should not be used in this patient population.

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. The experience with mexiletine in patients with severe renal impairment is limited. Therefore, the use of mexiletine is not recommended in this patient population.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of mexiletine in children and adolescents aged 0 to under 18 years have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Oral use.

The whole capsules should be swallowed with water, avoiding the supine position. In case of digestive intolerance, capsules should be taken during a meal.

## 4.3 Contraindications

- Hypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
- Hypersensitivity to any local anaesthetic.
- Ventricular tachyarrhythmia.
- Complete heart block (i.e. third-degree atrioventricular block) or any heart block susceptible to evolve to complete heart block (first-degree atrioventricular block with markedly prolonged PR interval (≥ 240 ms) and/or wide QRS complex (≥ 120 ms), second-degree atrioventricular block, bundle branch block, bifascicular and trifascicular block).
- Myocardial infarction (acute or past), or abnormal Q-waves.
- Symptomatic coronary artery disease.
- Heart failure with mid-range (40-49%) and reduced (&lt;40%) ejection fraction.
- Atrial tachyarrhythmia, fibrillation or flutter.
- Sinus node dysfunction (including sinus rate &lt; 50 bpm).
- Co-administration with medicinal products inducing torsades de pointes (see section 4.5).
- Co-administration with medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index (see section 4.5).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Cardiac arrhythmogenic effects

Mexiletine may induce an arrhythmia or accentuate a pre-existing arrhythmia, either diagnosed or undiagnosed (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).

Before starting mexiletine treatment, detailed and careful cardiac evaluation (ECG, 24-48-hour Holtermonitoring and echocardiography) should be carried out by a cardiologist in all patients in order to determine the cardiac tolerability of mexiletine. A cardiac evaluation is recommended shortly after treatment start (e.g. within 48 hours).

Throughout treatment with mexiletine, and in relation with dose changes, cardiac monitoring of patients needs to be adapted as a function of the heart condition of the patient:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Internal Doc Ref: v6.6

- In patients without cardiac abnormalities, periodic ECG monitoring is recommended (every 2 years or more frequently if considered necessary).
- In patients with cardiac abnormalities, and in patients prone to such abnormalities, detailed cardiac evaluation, including ECG, should be carried out before and after any dose increase. During maintenance treatment, detailed cardiac evaluation, including ECG, 24-48 hour Holtermonitoring and echocardiography, is recommended at least annually, or more frequently if considered necessary as part of routine cardiac assessment.

Patients should be informed about the presenting symptoms of arrhythmias (fainting, palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, light-headedness, lipothymia, and syncope) and should be advised to immediately contact an emergency centre if there are any symptoms of arrhythmias.

For cardiac disorders not listed in section 4.3, the benefit of the antimyotonic effects of mexiletine needs to be balanced against the risk of cardiac complications on a case by case basis. Mexiletine should be stopped immediately if any cardiac conduction abnormalities or any of the contraindications listed in the section 4.3 are detected.

Electrolytic imbalance such as hypokalaemia, hyperkalaemia or hypomagnesaemia may increase the proarrhythmic effects of mexiletine. Therefore, electrolytic evaluation should be done prior to initiating therapy with mexiletine in every patient. Electrolyte imbalance needs to be corrected before administering mexiletine and monitored throughout treatment (with a periodicity to be adapted patient by patient).

Increased concentrations of caffeine occurring with the co-administration of mexiletine may be of concern in patients with cardiac arrhythmia (see section 4.5).

## Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)

DRESS refers to a syndrome which includes in its complete form severe cutaneous eruptions, fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, haematological abnormalities with eosinophilia and atypical lymphocytes, and can involve other organs. Symptoms typically occur 1-8 weeks after exposure to the medicinal product. Severe systemic manifestations are responsible for a 10% mortality rate. Incidence of DRESS has been reported between 1:1 000 and 1:10 000 patients treated. Several medicinal products including anticonvulsants, antibiotics and also mexiletine have been identified as possible causes. Patients with known hypersensitivity to mexiletine or any other ingredients of this product or to any local anaesthetic are at high risk of developing DRESS and should not receive mexiletine (see section 4.3).

## Epilepsy

Epileptic patients need to be monitored because mexiletine can increase the frequency of seizure episodes.

## CYP2D6 polymorphism

CYP2D6 polymorphism may affect mexiletine pharmacokinetics (see section 5.2). Higher systemic exposure is expected in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers or who take medicinal products that inhibit CYP2D6 (see section 4.5). A period of at least 7 days before dose increase must be respected to ensure that steady-state levels are reached and that mexiletine is well tolerated in all patients, irrespective of CYP450 polymorphism.

## Smoking

Smoking affects mexiletine pharmacokinetics (see section 4.5). The mexiletine dose may need to be increased if a patient starts smoking and decreased if a patient stops smoking.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Internal Doc Ref: v6.6

## Pharmacodynamic interactions

## Antiarrhythmics inducing torsades de pointes (class Ia, Ic, III antiarrhythmics):

Co-administration of mexiletine and antiarrhythmics inducing torsades de pointes ( class Ia : quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, ajmaline; class Ic : encainide, flecainide, propafenone, moricizine; class III : amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide, dronedarone, vernakalant) increases the risk of potentially lethal torsades de pointes. The concomitant use of mexiletine and antiarrhythmic medicinal products inducing torsades de pointes is contraindicated (see section 4.3).

## Other antiarrhythmics (class Ib, II, IV antiarrhythmics):

Co-administration of mexiletine and other classes of antiarrhythmics ( class Ib : lidocaine, phenytoin, tocainide; class II : propranolol, esmolol, timolol, metoprolol, atenolol, carvedilol, bisoprolol, nebivolol; class IV : verapamil, diltiazem) is not recommended, unless exceptionally, because of the increased risk of adverse cardiac reactions (see section 4.4).

## Pharmacokinetic interactions

## Effect of other medicinal products on mexiletine

Mexiletine is a substrate for the metabolic pathways involving hepatic enzymes; inhibition or induction of these enzymes is expected to alter mexiletine plasma concentrations.

## CYP1A2 &amp; CYP2D6 inhibitors

Co-administration of mexiletine with a hepatic enzyme inhibitor (CYP1A2 inhibitor: ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine, propafenone; CYP2D6 inhibitor: propafenone, quinidine) significantly increases mexiletine exposure and thus the associated risk of adverse reactions to mexiletine. In a single-dose interaction study, the clearance of mexiletine was decreased by 38% following the coadministration of fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP1A2.

Therefore, clinical and ECG monitoring, as well as adaptation of mexiletine dose may be indicated throughout and after treatment with a CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor.

## CYP1A2 &amp; CYP2D6 inducers

Co-administration of mexiletine with a hepatic enzyme inducer (CYP1A2 inducer: omeprazole; CYP2D6 inducer: phenytoin, rifampicin) may increase the clearance and elimination rate of mexiletine due to an increased hepatic metabolism, resulting in decreased plasma concentrations and half-life of mexiletine.

In a clinical study, co-administration of mexiletine with phenytoin resulted in a significant decrease in exposure to mexiletine (p &lt; 0.003) due to enhanced clearance as reflected in significantly decreased elimination half-life (17.2 to 8.4 hours, p &lt; 0.02).

Therefore, based on the clinical response, the mexiletine dose should be adapted during and after treatment with the enzyme inducer.

After the oral administration of single (167 mg) and multiple (83 mg twice a day during 8 days) doses of mexiletine, total clearance of mexiletine is significantly increased in smokers (1.3 to 1.7-fold) due to induction of CYP1A2, resulting in a correspondingly decreased elimination half-life and drug exposure. Mexiletine dose may need to be increased if a patient starts to smoke during mexiletine treatment and decreased if a patient stops smoking.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Internal Doc Ref: v6.6

## Effect of mexiletine on other medicinal products

The potential of mexiletine as a drug-drug-interaction perpetrator is unknown. Patients should be carefully monitored if co-treated with other medicinal products with special emphasis to medicinal products with narrow therapeutic windows.

## CYP1A2 substrates

Mexiletine is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2; therefore, co-administration of mexiletine with medicinal products metabolised by CYP1A2 (such as theophylline, caffeine, lidocaine or tizanidine) may be associated with elevations in plasma concentrations of the concomitant medicinal product that could increase or prolong the therapeutic efficacy and/or the adverse reactions, especially if mexiletine is coadministered with CYP1A2 substrates with narrow therapeutic window, e.g. theophylline and tizanidine.

The CYP1A2 substrate blood levels should be monitored, particularly when the mexiletine dose is changed. An appropriate adjustment in the dose of the CYP1A2 substrate should be considered.

## Caffeine

In a clinical study in 12 subjects (5 healthy subjects and 7 patients with cardiac arrhythmias), the clearance of caffeine was decreased by 50% following the administration of mexiletine. Increased concentrations of caffeine occurring with the co-administration of mexiletine may be of concern in patients with cardiac arrhythmia. It is, therefore, recommended to reduce caffeine intake during treatment with mexiletine.

## OCT2 substrates

The organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) provides an important pathway for the uptake of cationic compounds in the kidney. Mexiletine may interact with medicinal products transported by OCT2 (such as metformin and dofetilide).

If mexiletine and other OCT2 substrates are to be used concurrently, the OCT2 substrate blood levels should be monitored, particularly when the mexiletine dose is changed. An appropriate adjustment in the dose of the OCT2 substrate should be considered.

## Substrates of other enzymes and transporters

The potential interactions between mexiletine and substrates of other common enzymes and transporters have not yet been assessed; it is currently contra-indicated to use mexiletine with any substrate having a narrow therapeutic window such as digoxin, lithium, phenytoin, theophylline or warfarin (see section 4.3).

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of mexiletine in pregnant women. Limited clinical data of the use of mexiletine in pregnant women shows that mexiletine crosses the placenta and reaches the foetus. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of mexiletine during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

Mexiletine is excreted in human milk. There is insufficient information on the effects of mexiletine in newborns/infants. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from mexiletine therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Internal Doc Ref: v6.6

The effects of mexiletine on fertility in humans have not been studied. Animal studies with mexiletine do not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Mexiletine has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue, confusion, blurred vision may occur following administration of mexiletine (see section 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with mexiletine are abdominal pain (12%), insomnia (12%) and vertigo (8%).

The  most  serious  reported  adverse  reactions  in  patients  treated  with  mexiletine  are  DRESS  and arrhythmia (atrioventricular block, arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The adverse reactions are tabulated below by SOC (system organ class) and by frequency, most frequent reactions first, with the following guidelines: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000), very rare (&lt; 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Very common and common adverse reactions are derived from data from the MYOMEX study; less common adverse reactions are derived from post-marketing data. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

## Symptoms

Fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses at 4.4 g of mexiletine hydrochloride ingestion but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of approximately 4 g of oral mexiletine hydrochloride.

The symptoms of mexiletine overdose include neurological disorders (paresthesia, confusion, hallucination, seizure) and cardiac disorders (sinus bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and in extreme cases, cardiac arrest).

## Overdose management

The treatment is mainly symptomatic. The seriousness of the symptoms may require hospital supervision. In case of bradycardia with hypotension, intravenous atropine should be used.  In case of seizure, benzodiazepines should be used.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Cardiac therapy, antiarrhythmics, class Ib, ATC code: C01BB02.

## Mechanism of action

Mexiletine blocks sodium channels with a stronger potency in situations of excessive burst of action potentials (use-dependent block) and/or prolonged depolarization (voltage-dependent block), as occurring in diseased tissues, rather than on physiological excitability (resting or tonic block). Mexiletine is, therefore, mostly active on muscle fibres subject to repeated discharges (such as skeletal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Internal Doc Ref: v6.6

muscles). It improves myotonic symptoms by decreasing muscle stiffness through reduction of the delay of muscle relaxation.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The efficacy and safety of mexiletine in non-dystrophic myotonia was evaluated in MYOMEX, a multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over (2 treatment periods of 18 days) study with a 4-day wash-out period in 13 patients with myotonia congenita (MC) and 12 patients with paramyotonia congenita (PC). Age of the overall study population ranged from 20 to 66 years old and about 2/3 of the patients were male. Patients who experienced myotonic symptoms that involved at least 2 segments and that had an impact on at least 3 daily activities were included into the study. The patients were randomized according to a cross-over design to a sequence including the 2 following treatments: a) mexiletine, started at 167 mg/day and titrated by increments of 167 mg every 3 days to reach a maximum dose of 500 mg/day in 1 week or b) placebo. 1

The primary efficacy measure for both MC and PC was the score of stiffness severity as self-reported by the patients on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The VAS is constructed as an absolute measure, with a 100 mm straight horizontal line having the endpoints 'no stiffness at all' (0) and 'worst possible stiffness' (100). The main secondary endpoints were changes in health-related quality of life as measured by individualised neuromuscular quality of life (INQoL) scale and the time needed to stand up from a chair, walk around the chair and sit down again (chair test).

Results for the primary and key secondary endpoints are summarised in the table below.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Namuscla in all subsets of the paediatric population in the symptomatic treatment of myotonic disorders (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Mexiletine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed following oral administration with a bioavailability of about 90% in healthy subjects. Peak plasma concentrations following oral administration occur within 2 to 3 hours. No notable accumulation of mexiletine was observed after repeated administration.

Food does not affect the rate or extent of absorption of mexiletine. Therefore, mexiletine can be taken with or without food.

## Distribution

Mexiletine is rapidly distributed in the body; its volume of distribution is large and varies from 5 to 9 L/kg in healthy individuals.

Mexiletine is weakly bound to plasma proteins (55%).

Mexiletine crosses the placental barrier and diffuses into breast milk.

## Biotransformation

Mexiletine is mainly (90%) metabolized in the liver, the primary pathway being CYP2D6 metabolism, although it is also a substrate for CYP1A2. The metabolic degradation proceeds via various pathways, including aromatic and aliphatic hydroxylation, dealkylation, deamination and N-oxidation. Several of the resulting metabolites are submitted to further conjugation with glucuronic acid (phase II metabolism); among these are the major metabolites p-hydroxymexiletine, hydroxy-methylmexiletine and N-hydroxymexiletine.

The influence of CYP2D6 phenotype on mexiletine metabolism has been extensively investigated. Mexiletine pharmacokinetics are characterised by significantly lower total and renal clearance

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Internal Doc Ref: v6.6

resulting in prolonged elimination half-life, higher exposure, and lower volume of distribution in poor metabolisers compared to extensive metabolisers.

Approximately 10% is excreted unchanged by the kidney.

## Elimination

Mexiletine is eliminated slowly in humans (with a mean elimination half-life of 10 hours, ranging from 5 to 15 hours).

Excretion of mexiletine essentially occurs through the kidney (90% of the dose, including 10% as unchanged mexiletine).

Mexiletine excretion may increase when the urinary pH is acidic, compared to normal or alkaline pH. In a clinical study, 51% of the mexiletine dose was excreted via the kidney at a urinary pH of 5, compared to 10% at normal pH. Changes in urinary pH are not expected to affect efficacy or safety.

## Linearity/non-linearity

A linear relationship between mexiletine dose and plasma concentration has been observed in the dose range of 83 to 500 mg.

## Special populations

## CYP2D6 polymorphism

CYP2D6 polymorphism affects mexiletine pharmacokinetics. Individuals who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PM) exhibit higher mexiletine concentrations than CYP2D6 intermediate (IM), extensive (i.e. normal) or ultra-rapid (UM) metabolisers. The proportions of different ethnic populations across these various classes are tabulated below.

| Ethnicity   | Poor metabolisers (PM)   | Intermediate metabolisers (IM)   | Ultra-rapid metabolisers(UM)   |
|-------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Caucasians  | Up to 10%                | 1-2%                             | Up to 10%                      |
| Africans    | Up to 10%                | -                                | Up to 5%                       |
| Asians      | Up to 5%                 | More than 50%                    | Up to 2%                       |

## Weight

In population pharmacokinetic analyses, weight was found to influence mexiletine pharmacokinetics.

## Age

There is no clinically relevant effect of age on the exposure of mexiletine in adults.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, toxicity to reproduction and development. The main observed effects in rats and/or dogs were vomiting, diarrhoea, tremor, ataxia, convulsions and tachycardia. However, these studies were not performed in accordance with contemporary standards and are, hence, of unclear clinical relevance.

The studies in rats on carcinogenic potential were negative, but not performed in accordance with current standards and therefore of unclear clinical relevance. The negative genotoxicity potential does not indicate an increased carcinogenic risk of treatment with mexiletine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Internal Doc Ref: v6.6

Prior to launch of Namuscla in each Member State (MS) the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must agree about the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority (NCA).

In order to prevent and / or minimise the important identified risks of Cardiac Arrhythmia in patients with Dystrophic Myotonia (off-label use) and Decreased Namuscla clearance, thus the risk of adverse reactions  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment,  the  MAH  shall  ensure  that  in  each  MS  where Namuscla is marketed, all healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients are provided, respectively, with:

- Educational guide for HCPs;
- Patient alert card

The Educational guide for HCPs, which should always be read in conjunction with the Summary of Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  before  prescribing  Namuscla,  should  contain  the  following  key elements:

- Information about the risk of cardiac arrhythmias in patients using Namuscla;
- Guidance to identify (and exclude) patients at a greater risk of developing arrhythmias due to Namuscla treatment;
- Contraindications with Namuscla which may increase the susceptibility to arrhythmias;
- Before starting treatment, HCPs should perform a detailed and careful cardiac evaluation in all patients, in order to determine the cardiac tolerability of Namuscla. A cardiac evaluation is also recommended shortly after starting Namuscla (e.g. within 48 hours).
- Throughout treatment with Namuscla:
- o In patients without cardiac abnormalities, an electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring should be performed periodically (every 2 years or more frequently, if considered necessary);
- o In patients with cardiac abnormalities, and in patients prone to such abnormalities, a detailed cardiac evaluation, including ECG should be carried out before and after any dose increase. During  maintenance  treatment,  detailed  cardiac  evaluation  including  ECG,  24-48  hour Holter-monitoring  and  echocardiography,  is  recommended  at  least  annually,  or  more frequently if considered necessary as part of routine cardiac assessment.
- Namuscla should be stopped immediately if the patient develops  cardiac  abnormalities,  is  not responding or experiencing benefit within Namuscla long-term treatment;
- Highlight  the  risk  of  decreased  Namuscla  clearance  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  and provide  guidance  on  how  to  treat  those  patients  in  order  to  prevent  it,  ensuring  Namuscla cautious titration in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (increasing the dose after at  least  2  weeks  of  treatment).  Namuscla  should  not  be  used  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic impairment;
- HCPs should counsel patients on:
- o The risk of cardiac arrhythmias (informing about symptoms of arrhythmias, advising patients to  contact  immediately  their  HCP,  or  emergency  centres,  if  they  experience  any  of  these symptoms);

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Internal Doc Ref: v6.6

- o The  risk  of  decreased  Namuscla  clearance  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  (advising patients to inform their HCP if they have any underlying hepatic disorder);
- Reporting of adverse reactions in patients using Namuscla.

The  patient  alert  card  (wallet  size),  to  be  handed  by  prescribing  specialist  and  to  be  read  in conjunction with the patient leaflet, should contain the following key messages:

- Patients should carry the card at all times, and show it at all medical visits to HCPs other than the prescriber (e.g. emergency HCPs);
- Prompts to enter the contact details of the patient, the treating physician, and Namuscla treatment starting date;
- Inform  patients  that,  before  starting  and  throughout  treatment  with  Namuscla,  HCPs  should perform a detailed and careful cardiac evaluation;
- Patients  should  inform  the  HCP  about  any  ongoing  medications  or  before  starting  any  new medication, while on treatment with Namuscla;
- Information  about  symptoms  of  cardiac  arrhythmias,  which  can  be  life-threatening,  and  when patients should seek HCP attention;
- Patients should not take more than 3 capsules of Namuscla per day or a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose;

## 1. What Namuscla is and what it is used for

Namuscla is a medicine that contains the active substance mexiletine.

Namuscla is used to treat the symptoms of myotonia (when muscles relax slowly and with difficulty after they are used) in adults with non-dystrophic myotonic disorders, which are caused by genetic defects that affect muscle function. Namuscla improves the symptoms of muscle stiffness and helps the patient to perform their daily activities.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Namuscla

## Do not take Namuscla

- -If you are allergic to mexiletine or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
- -If you are allergic to any local anaesthetic
- -If you have had heart attack
- -If your heart does not work well enough
- -If you have a heart condition that makes it beat irregularly.
- -If your heart beats too fast
- -If the blood vessels of your heart are damaged
- -If you also take certain medicines to treat disorders of the heart rhythm (see 'Other medicines and Namuscla')
- -If you also take certain medicines which have a narrow therapeutic window (see 'Other medicines and Namuscla').

If you have any doubt, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse before taking Namuscla if you have:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Internal Doc Ref: v6.6

- -Heart problems
- -Liver problems
- -Kidney problems
- -Low or high potassium blood levels
- -Low magnesium blood levels
- -Epilepsy

## Heart function

Before starting treatment with Namuscla, you will have tests to check how well your heart is working, including ECG (Electrocardiogram). These tests will also be performed regularly during treatment with Namuscla, and before and after your dose of Namuscla is modified. How often these tests will be performed depends on your heart function.

If you or your doctor detects any heart rhythm disturbances or any of the conditions stated in section 'Do not take Namuscla', your doctor will stop your treatment with Namuscla.

If you notice that the rhythm of your heart changes (the heart beats faster or slower), if you feel fluttering or pain in your chest, if you have difficulty breathing, if you feel dizzy, if you sweat or if you faint, you have to contact an emergency centre immediately .

Some patients may have higher blood levels of Namuscla because of slower break down in the liver and the dose may need to be adjusted accordingly.

Your doctor may measure your potassium and magnesium levels in the blood before starting and during treatment with Namuscla.

## Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)

If you are hypersensitive to mexiletine or any other ingredients of this product or to any local anaesthetic do not take Namuscla and contact your doctor immediately. Symptoms of hypersensitivity and DRESS include fever, skin rash and blisters, swollen face and swollen lymph glands.

## Children and adolescents

Namuscla should not be used in children and adolescents younger than 18 years old.

## Other medicines and Namuscla

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

Do not take Namuscla with certain medicines for treating heart rhythm disorders (quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, ajmaline, encainide, flecainide, propafenone, moricizine, amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide, dronedarone, vernakalant). See section 'Do not take Namuscla'. Taking Namuscla together with any of these medicines increases the risk of a serious heart rhythm disturbance called torsades de pointes.

Do not take Namuscla with certain medicines which have a so called narrow therapeutic window (these are medicines where small differences in dose or blood concentration may impact the effect of the medicine or side effects). Examples of such medicines are digoxin (for heart problems), lithium (mood stabiliser), phenytoin (for treating epilepsy), theophylline (against asthma) and warfarin (against blood clots).

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following since these medicines may affect or be affected by Namuscla:

- Medicines for heart problems (lidocaine, tocainide, propranolol, esmolol, metoprolol, atenolol, carvedilol, bisoprolol, nebivolol, verapamil, diltiazem),
- Certain other medicines:
- o Timolol for treating high pressure in the eye (glaucoma),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Internal Doc Ref: v6.6

- o Certain antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, rifampicin),
- o Certain antidepressants (fluvoxamine),
- o Tizanidine (used to relax the muscles),
- o Metformin (used against diabetes)
- o Omeprazole (to treat stomach ulcer and gastric acid reflux).

## Smoking and Namuscla

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you start to smoke or quit smoking while taking Namuscla because smoking impacts the Namuscla blood levels and your dose may need to be adjusted accordingly.

## Namuscla with drink

It is recommended to reduce your caffeine intake by half while on treatment with mexiletine because the medicine can increase caffeine levels in your blood.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. If you become pregnant while taking Namuscla, see your doctor immediately as it is preferable not to take Namuscla while you are pregnant.

Mexiletine passes into human milk. You should talk to your doctor about this, together you will make a decision whether to abstain breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from mexiletine therapy.

## Driving and using machines

Namuscla may in rare cases cause tiredness, confusion, blurred vision: If you have these effects do not drive, cycle and use machines.
