## 1. Introduction

On 7 September 2015, the MAH submitted the immunogenicity and safety results of study HPV-071 from Month 18 up to Month 24 for Cervarix, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

HPV-071 is a paediatric study documenting immunogenicity and safety of Cervarix in healthy females aged 9-14 years in a 2-dose schedule vs. Gardasil administered in a 2-dose and in a 3-dose (ELISA).

Analyses were performed as planned in the protocol except that the Pseudovirion-Based Neutralization Assay (PBNA) analysis was not performed at the Month 24 time point. Results for this assay at Month 24 will be presented in the CSR written for the next time point (Month 36).

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Cervarix and the placebo vaccine (Al(OH)3) were developed and manufactured by GSK Biologicals.

The comparator vaccine, Gardasil, was licensed by Merck &amp; Co in all countries participating in this study.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted an interim report for:

- Study 115411 (HPV-071), a Phase IIIb observer-blind, randomized, multicentre primary immunization study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Cervarix (bivalent HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04-adjuvanted) and Gardasil (quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18 aluminium-adjuvanted), when administered intramuscularly according to alternative 2-dose schedules in 9-14 year old healthy females.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Description

HPV-071 is an ongoing Phase IIIb observer-blind, randomized, multi-centre trial (Sweden, Hong Kong, France and Singapore).

## Methods

## Objectives

## Primary objective

## Immunogenicity

- The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate sequentially if the immunogenicity (as determined by ELISA) of Cervarix was non-inferior/superior to that of Gardasil after administration according to a 2-dose schedule at 0, 6 months in 9-14 years old females, one month after the last dose (Month 7).

If non-inferiority at Month 7 was shown, non-inferiority/superiority analysis by comparison of the immune response to both vaccine antigens between the Cervarix 2-dose group and the Gardasil 2-dose group at Months 12, 18, 24 and 36 will be performed (first secondary objective).

## Secondary objective

## Immunogenicity

- If the primary non-inferiority objective is reached, the next objective is to evaluate sequentially if the immunogenicity (as determined by ELISA) of a 2-dose Cervarix schedule is noninferior/superior to that of a 2-dose Gardasil schedule, both administered at 0, 6 months, at Months 12, 18, 24 and 36.
- If the primary non-inferiority objective is reached, the next objective is to evaluate sequentially if the immunogenicity (as determined by ELISA) of a 2-dose Cervarix schedule at 0, 6 months is non-inferior/superior to that of a 3-dose Gardasil schedule at 0, 2, 6 months at Months 7, 12, 18, 24 and 36.
- To assess the immune responses to HPV types 16 and 18 by ELISA at Day 0 and Months 7, 12, 18, 24 and 36 in all subjects.
- To assess the immune responses to HPV types 16 and 18 by PBNA in a subset of subjects at Day 0 and Months 7, 12, 18, 24 and 36.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- To assess cell-mediated immunity (CMI), i.e., T-cell-mediated and memory B-cell immune responses specific to HPV-16 and HPV-18 in a sub-cohort of subjects at Day 0, Months 7, 12, 24 and 36.

## Safety

- To assess the reactogenicity of the administered vaccines in all groups after each dose.
- To assess the safety of the administered vaccines in all groups.
- To evaluate compliance with completion of vaccination in all groups.

## Study design

HPV-071 is a Phase IIIb, observer-blind, randomised, age-stratified, multicentre study with 3 parallel groups.

## Statistical Methods

Comparison between groups

- Primary between-group comparisons to assess the non-inferiority at Month 7 were performed in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity on subjects seronegative by ELISA at Day 0 for the antigen under analysis. Subjects seropositive for only one antigen were eliminated for the analysis of that antigen but were still evaluable for the analysis of the other antigen. In addition, non-inferiority assessment was also performed in the TVC on all subjects (regardless of serostatus at Day 0).
- Between-group comparisons to assess superiority were performed in the TVC on all subjects (regardless of serostatus at Day 0). In addition, superiority assessment was also performed in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity on subjects seronegative at Day 0 for the antigen under analysis.

Criteria for non-inferiority

- Non-inferiority with respect to seroconversion rates was shown if, one month after the last dose, for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies, the upper limit of the 95% CI for the difference (Gardasil minus Cervarix) was below 5%.
- Non-inferiority with respect to GMT for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies was shown if, one month after the last dose, the upper limit of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio (Gardasil divided by Cervarix) was below 2.

Criteria for superiority

- If non-inferiority was reached, and if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs Cervarix divided by Gardasil of a given antigen was above 1 in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity, the following criteria for superiority were to be assessed sequentially in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## TVC:

- o First, superiority for HPV-18 was assessed. Superiority was shown if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs for anti-HPV-18 antibodies (Cervarix divided by Gardasil) was above 1 with the associated p-value.
- o Second, if superiority for HPV-18 is shown, superiority for HPV-16 was assessed. Superiority was shown if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs for antiHPV-16 antibodies (Cervarix divided by Gardasil) was above 1 with the associated pvalue.

## Demographic characteristics

- In the ATP cohort, the age at vaccination was comparable between the different groups (11.5 ± 1.62 years in Cervarix group, 11.5 ± 1.55 years in Gardasil 2-dose group and 11.6 ± 1.63 years in Gardasil 3-dose group).
- The three groups had a comparable ethnical/racial distribution, with an approximate 50% of the subjects in each group of East Asian heritage and an approximate 25% of Caucasian heritage. Demographic characteristics in the TVC were similar.

## Results

After a 2-dose Cervarix vaccination as compared to a 3-dose Gardasil vaccination in females aged 9-14 years of age, study HPV-071 demonstrated at Month 24

- -Non-inferiority in terms of seroconversion rates; and

- -Superiority in terms of GMT ratio in the Total Vaccinated cohort.

## · Persistence of HPV antibody titres (Cervarix 2-dose vs Gardasil 2-dose or 3-dose)

GMTs for antibodies against both HPV-16 and HPV-18, which had reached a peak response at Month 7, showed a continuous decline thereafter in all three groups, but remained higher in the Cervarix group as compared to both Gardasil groups at Month 24 (Figure 3). This is in line with previous observations.

## · Anti-HPV-16/18 neutralising antibodies measured by PBNA at Month 18

Pseudovirion-based neutralization assays (PBNA) for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 was performed on a subset of 100 randomly selected subjects for each study group.

- All initially seronegative subjects in HPV\\_2D group and at least 97.8% of subjects in the Gard\\_2D and Gard\\_3D groups had seroconverted for anti-HPV-16 neutralising antibodies when measured by PBNA.
- All initially seronegative subjects in HPV\\_2D group had seroconverted for anti-HPV-18 neutralising antibodies when measured by PBNA. In Gard\\_2D group, 88.0% of subjects and in Gard\\_3D group, 97.8% of subjects had seroconverted for anti-HPV-18 neutralising antibodies when measured by PBNA.
- GMT levels for neutralizing antibodies against both HPV-16 and HPV-18, which had reached a peak response at Month 7, showed a further decline at Month 18 in all three groups.
- Anti-HPV-16/18 neutralising antibodies measured by PBNA at Month 24

Analyses were performed as planned in the protocol except that the Pseudovirion-Based Neutralization Assay (PBNA) analysis was not performed at the Month 24 time point. Results for this assay at Month 24 will be presented in the CSR written for the next time point (Month 36).

## · T-cell-mediated immune responses

## CD8+ T cell response

As observed in the previous time points, HPV-16 and HPV-18 specific CD8+ T cells response was undetectable (1.0 cell per million CD8+ T cells) in all three groups at Month 24.

## · Memory B-cell-mediated immune responses

At Month 24, B cells response (in terms of median frequency of HPV-16/18 antigenspecific memory B cells per million memory B cells in subjects with detectable B cells) was as presented in Figure 5

and the DLP for this CSR. The investigator considered this event as not related to study vaccine.

There were no adverse events that led to premature discontinuation of the study from Month 12 to Month 24.

More SAEs were reported for Cervarix over the entire study period up until Month 24, as well as in the period between Month 18 and Month 24, as shown in Tables 8 and 9 below.

Table 9. Global Summary of SAEs from Month 18 - Month 24 (Month 24 Total Vaccinated cohort)

None of these SAEs were considered by the investigator to have a possible causal relationship to vaccination. All SAEs resolved without sequelae except for the SAEs - colitis ulcerative, anaphylactic reaction and juvenile idiopathic arthritis which were resolving at the time of the data lock point of this study.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Non-inferiority and superiority of immune responses to both HPV-16 and HPV-18 antigens was demonstrated at Month 18 and Month 24 when Cervarix was administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0,6 months in 9-14 year old females versus Gardasil administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0, 6 months or according to a 3-dose schedule at 0,2,6 months.

Both vaccines were generally well tolerated when administered according to a 3-dose or 2-dose schedule in subjects aged 9-14 years. However, more SAEs were reported in the 2-dose Cervarix group over the entire study period up until Month 24, as well as in the period between Month 18 and Month 24, compared to the Gardasil groups, regardless of the number of Gardasil doses.
