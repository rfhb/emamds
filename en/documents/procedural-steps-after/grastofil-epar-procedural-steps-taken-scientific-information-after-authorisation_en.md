| II/0003/G   | This was an application for a group of variations. Update the product information to include the paediatric population in the currently approved indication for use in adults, as per the reference product SmPC, and to introduce graduations on the syringe barrel enabling use of the Grastofil in accordance with the paediatric posology. Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 6.5 of the SmPC and Section 3 and 6 of the Package Leaflet have been updated with the paediatric use. In addition, Sections 5.1 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated in alignment with the Neupogen PI. C.I.2.b - Change in the SPC, Labelling or PL of a generic/hybrid/biosimilar products following assessment of the same change for the reference product - Change(s) require to be further substantiated by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH B.II.e.6.z - Change in any part of the (primary) packaging material not in contact with the finished product   | 25/04/2014   | 22/05/2014 no   | SmPC and PL   | The MAH submitted a group of variations to introduce minor graduations in the existing prefilled syringe for both strengths in order to include the paediatric population in the currently approved indication, as per the reference product SmPC, The MAH conducted two dose accuracy studies, one study evaluating 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mL graduations and the second study evaluating minor gradations at increments of 0.025 mL. The results from the second study confirm a similar level of error margin as seen in the initial study. The data demonstrate that higher variances are not evident at the 0.025 mL graduations relative to the 0.1 mL graduations. The product information has been updated in alignment with the Neupogen PI. The benefit risk of Grastofil use in the paediatric population is considered positive. longer authorised   |
