Adults: 0.12 ml/kg body weight (equivalent to 0.03 mmol/kg) Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Imaging time points

Dynamic imaging begins immediately upon injection. Steady state imaging can begin after the dynamic scan has been completed. In clinical trials, imaging was completed up to approximately one hour following injection.

No clinical information is available about repeated use of this medicinal product.

## Special populations

Elderly (aged 65 years and above)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No dose adjustment is considered necessary. Caution should be exercised in elderly patients (see section 4.4).

## Renal impairment

Use of Ablavar should be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment

Hepatic impairment Dose adjustments in hepatic impairment are not necessary (see section 5.2). Paediatric population Use is not recommended in neonates, infants, children and adolescents. No clinical experience is yet available for patients younger than 18. Method of administration This medicinal product should be administered as a single intravenous bolus injection, manually, or by magnetic resonance injector (MR injector) over a period of time up to 30 seconds followed by a 2530 ml normal saline flush. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Diagnostic procedures involving the use of MRI contrast agents should be carried out under the supervision of a physician with the prerequisite training and a thorough knowledge of the procedure to be performed. Appropriate facilities should be available for coping with any complication of the procedure, as well as for emergency treatment of potential severe reactions to the contrast agent itself. The usual safety precautions for magnetic resonance imaging must be observed, e.g., exclusion of cardiac pacemakers and ferromagnetic implants. As with other contrast enhanced diagnostic procedures, post-procedure observation of the patient is recommended, in particular in patients with a history of allergy, renal insufficiency, or adverse reaction. Hypersensitivity warning The possibility of a reaction, including serious, life-threatening, fatal, anaphylactoid, or cardiovascular reactions, or other idiosyncratic reactions should always be considered especially in those patients with a known clinical hypersensitivity, previous reaction of contrast media, a history of asthma, or other allergic disorders. Experience with other contrast media shows that the risk of hypersensitivity reactions is higher in those patients. Delayed reactions may occur (after hours to days). Medicinal product no longer authorised

(GFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) and in patients in the perioperative liver transplantation period unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (see section 4.4). If use of Ablavar cannot be avoided, the dose should not exceed 0.03 mmol/kg body weight. More than one dose should not be used during a scan. Because of the lack of information on repeated administration, Ablavar injections should not be repeated unless the interval between injections is at least 7 days.

Caution should also be exercised in the following cases:

## Hypersensitivity reactions

If hypersensitivity reactions occur (see section 4.8), administration of the contrast medium must be discontinued immediately and - if necessary - specific therapy instituted via a venous access. It is therefore advisable to use a flexible indwelling cannula for intravenous contrast medium administration. Due to the possibility of severe hypersensitivity reactions after intravenous contrast administration, preparedness for institution of emergency measures is necessary, e.g., appropriate medicinal products, an endotracheal tube, and a respirator should be at hand.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

Since gadofosveset is cleared from the body primarily by urinary excretion, caution should be exercised in patients with impaired renal function (see section 4.2 and 5.2).

## Prior to administration of Ablavar, it is recommended that all patients are screened for renal dysfunction by obtaining laboratory tests.

There have been reports of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) associated with use of some gadolinium-containing contrast agents in patients with acute or chronic severe renal impairment (GFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ). Patients undergoing liver transplantation are at particular risk since the incidence of acute renal failure is high in this group. As there is a possibility that NSF may occur with Ablavar, it should therefore be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment and in patients in the perioperative liver transplantation period unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast enhanced MRI.

Because gadofosveset is bound to albumin, an interaction with other plasma protein bound active substances (e.g., ibuprofen and warfarin) is generally possible, i.e., a competition for the protein binding site can occur. However, in a series of in vitro drug interaction studies (in 4.5 % human serum albumin and human plasma), gadofosveset demonstrated no adverse interaction with digitoxin, propranolol, verapamil, warfarin, phenprocoumon, ibuprofen, diazepam, ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and piroxicam at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes did not indicate any potential to inhibit the cytochrome P 450 enzyme system.

Haemodialysis shortly after Ablavar administration may be useful at removing Ablavar from the body. There is no evidence to support the initiation of haemodialysis for prevention or treatment of NSF in patients not already undergoing haemodialysis. Elderly As the renal clearance of gadofosveset may be impaired in the elderly, it is particularly important to screen patients aged 65 years and older for renal dysfunction. Haemodialysis shortly after Ablavar administration in patients currently receiving haemodialysis may be useful at removing Ablavar from the body. In a clinical trial it was shown that gadofosveset can effectively be removed from the body by dialysis using high flux filters. There is no evidence to support the initiation of haemodialysis for prevention or treatment of NSF in patients not already undergoing haemodialysis. Electrocardiographic changes Elevated levels of gadofosveset (e.g. repeated use in the short term [within 6-8 hours], or an inadvertent overdose &gt; 0.05 mmol/kg) may be associated with mild QT prolongation (8.5 msec by Fridericia correction). In the situation of elevated levels of gadofosveset or underlying QT prolongation the patient should be carefully observed including cardiac monitoring. Vascular stents It has been shown in published studies that MRA in the presence of metallic stents causes artefacts. The reliability of lumen visualisation in a stented vessel with Ablavar has not been evaluated. Sodium This medicine contains 6.3 mmol sodium (or 145 mg) per dose. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Medicinal product no longer authorised

In a clinical study, it was shown that gadofosveset does not affect the unbound fraction of warfarin in plasma. The anticoagulant activity of warfarin was not altered and the efficacy of the medicinal product was not influenced.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Laboratory test interactions

In clinical trials using Ablavar, no specific trends were observed that would signify a potential interaction of the medicinal product with laboratory test methods.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of Ablavar in pregnant women. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity at repeated high doses (see section 5.3). Ablavar should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires use of the medicinal product.

Breast-feeding Gadolinium containing contrast agents are excreted into breast milk in very small amounts (see section 5.3). At clinical doses, no effects on the infant are anticipated due to the small amount excreted in milk and poor absorption from the gut. Continuing breastfeeding or discontinuing Ablavar for a period of 24 hours after administration should be at the discretion of the physician and breast-feeding mother. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed. Uncommonly, dizziness or vision problems may occur with this medicine. If a patient experiences these effects he/she should not drive or use machines 4.8 Undesirable effects The most common adverse reactions were pruritus, paresthesia, headache, nausea, vasodilatation, burning sensation and dysgeusia. Most of the adverse reactions were mild to moderate in intensity. Most of the adverse reactions (80%) occurred within 2 hours. Delayed reactions (after hours to days) may occur. Clinical trial data Based on clinical trial experience in more than 1,800 patients, the following adverse reactions have been observed. The table below reports adverse reactions by MedDRA system organ classes (MedDRA SOCs). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Injury, poisoning and procedural complications Cases of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) have been reported with other gadolinium-containing contrast agents (see section 4.4). As with other intravenous contrast agents, this medicinal product can be associated with anaphylactoid / hypersensitivity reactions characterised by cutaneous, respiratory and/or cardiovascular manifestations which may lead to shock. 4.9 Overdose Ablavar can be removed by haemodialysis. However, there is no evidence that haemodialysis is suitable for prevention of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Contrast media, paramagnetic contrast media, ATC code: V08CA.

Ablavar is a formulation of a stable gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (GdDTPA) chelate substituted with a diphenylcyclohexylphosphate group (gadofosveset trisodium), for use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Gadofosveset binds reversibly to human serum albumin. Protein binding enhances T1 relaxivity of gadofosveset up to 10 fold compared to non-protein bound gadolinium chelates. In human studies, gadofosveset substantially shortens blood T1 values for up to 4 hours after intravenous bolus injection. Relaxivity in plasma was measured to be 33.4 to 45.7 mM -1 s -1 over the dose range of up to 0.05 mmol/kg at 20 MHz. High resolution MRA scans of vascular structures are obtained up to one hour after administration of the medicinal product. The extended vascular imaging window for gadofosveset is attributed to enhanced relaxivity and extended residence in vascular space resulting from its plasma protein binding. No comparative studies with extracellular gadolinium contrast agents have been conducted.

The safety and effectiveness of Ablavar in patients under 18 years of age have not been established.

5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Distribution The plasma concentration-time profile of intravenously administered gadofosveset conforms to a twocompartment open model. After intravenous administration of 0.03 mmol/kg dose the mean half-life of the distribution phase (t 1/2  ) was 0.48 ± 0.11 hours and the volume of distribution at steady state was 148 ± 16 ml/kg, roughly equivalent to that of extracellular fluid. Plasma protein binding was in a range 80% to 87% for up to the first 4 hours after injection. Biotransformation The results from various evaluations of plasma and urine samples indicated that gadofosveset does not undergo measurable metabolism. Elimination In healthy volunteers, gadofosveset was predominantly eliminated in the urine with 84% (range 79 94%) of the injected dose (0.03 mmol/kg) excreted in the urine in 14 days. Ninety-four percent (94%) of the urinary excretion occurred in the first 72 hours. A small portion of gadofosveset dose was recovered in the faeces (4.7%, range 1.1 - 9.3%), indicating a minor role of biliary excretion in the disposition of gadofosveset. After intravenous administration of 0.03 mmol/kg dose renal clearance (5.51 ± 0.85 ml/h/kg) and total clearance (6.57 ± 0.97 ml/h/kg) were similar, and mean terminal elimination half-life was 18.5 ± 3.0 hours. Characteristics in patients Renal impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal impairment the half-life is markedly prolonged and the AUC increased by 2-3fold. Hemodialysis patients Gadofosveset can be removed from the body by hemodialysis. After bolus intravenous administration of 0.05 mmol/kg dose in patients requiring three times a week haemodialysis using high-flux filter, at the end of third dialysis session, the plasma concentration had declined to less than 15 % of the Cmax. During the dialysis sessions the mean half-life of plasma concentration decline was in the range 5-6 hours. The mean dialysis clearance was between the range of 16-32 ml/h/kg. The high-flux dialysis filter was more efficient compared to the low-flux filter, therefore, use of a high-flux dialysis filter is recommended. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hepatic impairment

Plasma pharmacokinetics and protein binding of gadofosveset were not significantly influenced by moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B). A slight decrease in faecal elimination of gadofosveset was seen for the hepatic impaired subjects (2.7%) compared to normal subjects (4.8%). In one subject with moderate hepatic impairment and abnormally low serum albumin, total clearance and half-life of gadofosveset was indicative of faster clearance compared to subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and normal serum albumin levels.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, acute toxicity, local tolerance, contact-sensitising potential, and genotoxicity.

No carcinogenicity studies were performed.

## Repeated dose toxicity

Repeated-dose toxicity studies revealed vacuolation of the tubular cells of the kidneys, with strong evidence for reversibility of the effect. No functional impairment was observed and electron microscopic investigations of the rat kidneys indicated that the observed vacuolation was primarily a storage phenomenon. Effects were of higher severity in rats than in monkeys, probably because of the higher renal clearance in rats. In monkeys, no renal effects were observed after single use even at a dose 100-times higher than the clinical dose.

Reproduction toxicity In rabbits, an increased number of early resorptions and a slight but significant increase in the number of foetal anomalies (in particular hydrocephalus and malrotated limbs) were observed at doses at which no or slight maternal toxicity was observed (exposure was 2 and 5 times the expected human exposure, respectively). In an animal study, it was shown that less than 1% of the dose of gadofosveset administered enters breast milk. 6.

It is for use in adults only. Ablavar is for diagnostic use only. It is used to help detect changes in the blood vessels which are known or suspected to be abnormal. The diagnosis can be made with greater accuracy than without using this medicine. This medicine, a contrast agent with magnetic properties, helps to visualise the passage of blood through the vessels by brightening the blood for an extended period. This medicine is used together with an imaging technique called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If you have any questions or are not sure about something, ask the doctor or MRI-centre personnel. 2. BEFORE YOU ARE GIVEN ABLAVAR Do not use Ablavar You must not be given Ablavar if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to gadofosveset or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (see section 6 of this leaflet).

## Prior to administration of Ablavar it is recommended that all patients are screened for renal dysfunction by obtaining laboratory tests.

There have been reports of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) associated with use of some gadolinium-containing contrast agents in patients with acute or chronic severe renal impairment (GFR&lt; 30 ml/min /1.73 m 2 ). Patients undergoing liver transplantation are at particular risk since the

incidence of acute renal failure is high in this group. As there is a possibility that NSF may occur with Ablavar, it should therefore be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment and in patients in the perioperative liver transplantation period unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast enhanced MRI. If use of Ablavar cannot be avoided, the dose should not exceed 0.03 mmol/kg body weight. More than one dose should not be used during a scan. Because of the lack of information on repeated administration, Ablavar injections should not be repeated unless the interval between injections is at least 7 days.

As the renal clearance of gadofosveset may be impaired in the elderly, it is particularly important to screen patients aged 65 years and older for renal dysfunction.

Haemodialysis shortly after Ablavar administration may be useful at removing Ablavar from the body. There is no evidence to support the initiation of haemodialysis for prevention or treatment of NSF in patients not already undergoing haemodialysis. Ablavar should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires use of gadofosveset. Continuing breast feeding or discontinuing Ablavar for a period of 24 hours after administration, should be at the discretion of the doctor and lactating mother. The peel-off tracking label included on the vials should be stuck onto the patient record to enable accurate recording of the gadolinium contrast agent used. The dose used should also be recorded. Ablavar is supplied ready to use as a clear, colourless to pale yellow aqueous solution. Contrast media should not be used in case of severe discolouration, the occurrence of particulate matter, or defective container. Vials containing Ablavar are not intended for the withdrawal of multiple doses. The rubber stopper should never be pierced more than once. After withdrawal of the solution from the vial, this medicinal product should be used immediately. Any remaining solution not used in one examination must be discarded.
