## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Opdualag 240 mg/80 mg concentrate for solution for infusion

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each mL of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 12 mg of nivolumab and 4 mg of relatlimab. One vial of 20 mL contains 240 mg of nivolumab and 80 mg of relatlimab.

Nivolumab and relatlimab are human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibodies produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Concentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate).

Clear to opalescent, colourless to slightly yellow liquid that is essentially free of particles. The solution has a pH of approximately 5.8 and an osmolality of approximately 310 mOsm/kg.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Opdualag is indicated for the first-line treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with tumour cell PD-L1 expression &lt; 1%.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment must be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the treatment of cancer.

Patients treated with Opdualag must be given the patient card and be informed about the risks of Opdualag (see also package leaflet).

## PD-L1 testing

Patients should be selected for treatment with Opdualag based on the tumour expression of PD-L1 confirmed by a validated test (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

## Posology

The recommended dose for adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older is 480 mg nivolumab and 160 mg relatlimab every 4 weeks administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. This dose is established for adolescent patients weighing at least 30 kg (see section 5.2).

Treatment with Opdualag should be continued as long as clinical benefit is observed or until treatment is no longer tolerated by the patient. Dose escalation or reduction is not recommended. Dosing delay or discontinuation may be required based on individual safety and tolerability. Guidelines for permanent discontinuation or withholding of doses are described in Table 1. Detailed guidelines for the management of immune-related adverse reactions are described in section 4.4.

a Recommendation for the use of hormone replacement therapy is provided in section 4.4.

b The safety of re-initiating Opdualag in patients previously experiencing immune-related myocarditis is not known.

## Special populations

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Opdualag in children below 12 years of age have not been established. No data are available (see section 5.2).

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (≥ 65 years) (see section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). Data from patients with severe renal impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on this population.

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). Data from patients with severe hepatic impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on this population.

## Method of administration

Opdualag is for intravenous use only. It is to be administered as an intravenous infusion over a period of 30 minutes.

Opdualag must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection.

Opdualag can be used without dilution, or may be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection (see section 6.6).

For instructions on the preparation and handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Assessment of PD-L1 status

When assessing the PD-L1 status of the tumour, it is important that a well-validated and robust methodology is used.

## Immune-related adverse reactions

Immune-related adverse reactions can occur with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab which require appropriate management, including initiation of corticosteroids and treatment modifications (see section 4.2).

Immune-related adverse reactions affecting more than one body system can occur simultaneously.

Patients should be monitored continuously (at least up to 5 months after the last dose) as an adverse reaction with Opdualag may occur at any time during or after discontinuation of therapy.

For suspected immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm aetiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, Opdualag should be withheld and corticosteroids administered. If immunosuppression with corticosteroids is used to treat an adverse reaction, a taper of at least 1 month duration should be initiated upon improvement. Rapid tapering may lead to worsening or recurrence of the adverse reaction. Non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy should be added if there is worsening or no improvement despite corticosteroid use.

In patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease (AID), data from observational studies suggest that the risk of immune-mediated adverse reactions following immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy may be increased as compared with the risk in patients without pre-existing AID. In addition, flares of the underlying AID were frequent, but the majority were mild and manageable. However, data specific to the combination of nivolumab and relatlimab are scarce.

Opdualag should not be resumed while the patient is receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapy. Prophylactic antibiotics may be used to prevent opportunistic infections in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy.

Opdualag must be permanently discontinued for any severe immune-related adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-related adverse reaction.

## Immune-related pneumonitis

Severe pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, including a fatal case, has been observed with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis such as radiographic changes (e.g. focal ground glass opacities, patchy infiltrates), dyspnoea, and hypoxia. Infectious and disease-related aetiologies should be ruled out.

For Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis, Opdualag must be permanently discontinued, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents.

For Grade 2 (symptomatic) pneumonitis, Opdualag should be withheld and corticosteroids initiated at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, Opdualag may be resumed after corticosteroid taper. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should be increased to 2 to 4 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents, and Opdualag must be permanently discontinued.

## Immune-related colitis

Severe diarrhoea or colitis has been observed with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for diarrhoea and additional symptoms of colitis, such as abdominal pain and mucus and/or blood in stool. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-related colitis. Infectious and other aetiologies of diarrhoea should be ruled out, therefore appropriate laboratory tests and additional

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

examinations must be performed. If diagnosis of corticosteroid-refractory immune-related colitis is confirmed, addition of an alternative immunosuppressive agent to the corticosteroid therapy, or replacement of the corticosteroid therapy should be considered.

For Grade 4 diarrhoea or colitis, Opdualag must be permanently discontinued, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents.

Opdualag should be withheld for Grade 3 diarrhoea or colitis, and corticosteroids initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, Opdualag may be resumed after corticosteroid taper. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, Opdualag must be permanently discontinued.

For Grade 2 diarrhoea or colitis, Opdualag should be withheld. Persistent diarrhoea or colitis should be managed with corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, Opdualag may be resumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should be increased to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents, and Opdualag must be permanently discontinued.

## Immune-related hepatitis

Severe hepatitis has been observed with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatitis such as transaminase and total bilirubin elevations. Infectious and disease-related aetiologies should be ruled out.

For AST or ALT increases to more than 5 times ULN regardless of baseline, total bilirubin increases to more than 3 times ULN, or concurrent AST or ALT increase to more than 3 times ULN and total bilirubin increase to more than 2 times ULN, Opdualag must be permanently discontinued, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents.

For AST/ALT increases to more than 3 and up to 5 times ULN, or total bilirubin increases to more than 1.5 and up to 3 times ULN, Opdualag should be withheld. Persistent elevations in these laboratory values should be managed with corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, Opdualag may be resumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should be increased to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents, and Opdualag must be permanently discontinued.

## Immune-related nephritis and renal dysfunction

Severe nephritis and renal dysfunction have been observed with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of nephritis or renal dysfunction. Most patients present with asymptomatic increases in serum creatinine. Disease-related aetiologies should be ruled out.

For Grade 4 serum creatinine elevation, Opdualag must be permanently discontinued, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents.

For Grade 2 or 3 serum creatinine elevation, Opdualag should be withheld, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, Opdualag may be resumed after corticosteroid taper. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should be increased to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents, and Opdualag must be permanently discontinued.

## Immune-related endocrinopathies

Severe endocrinopathies, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency (including secondary adrenocortical insufficiency), hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), and diabetes mellitus have been observed with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab. Cases of diabetic ketoacidosis have been observed with nivolumab monotherapy and could potentially occur with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab (see section 4.8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of endocrinopathies, and for hyperglycaemia and changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation). Patients may present with fatigue, headache, mental status changes, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, and hypotension, or nonspecific symptoms which may resemble other causes such as brain metastasis or underlying disease. Unless an alternate aetiology has been identified, signs or symptoms of endocrinopathies should be considered immune-related.

## Thyroid dysfunction

For symptomatic hypothyroidism, Opdualag should be withheld, and thyroid hormone replacement should be initiated as needed. For symptomatic hyperthyroidism, Opdualag should be withheld and antithyroid treatment should be initiated as needed. Corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents should also be considered if acute inflammation of the thyroid is suspected. Upon improvement, Opdualag may be resumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. Monitoring of thyroid function should continue to ensure appropriate hormone replacement is utilised. Opdualag must be permanently discontinued for life-threatening (Grade 4) hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.

## Adrenal insufficiency

Opdualag must be permanently discontinued for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) adrenal insufficiency. For symptomatic Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency, Opdualag should be withheld, and physiologic corticosteroid replacement should be initiated as needed. Monitoring of adrenal function and hormone levels should continue to ensure appropriate corticosteroid replacement is utilised.

## Hypophysitis

Opdualag must be permanently discontinued for life-threatening (Grade 4) hypophysitis. For symptomatic Grade 2 or 3 hypophysitis, Opdualag should be withheld, and hormone replacement should be initiated as needed. Corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents should also be considered if acute inflammation of the pituitary gland is suspected. Upon improvement, Opdualag may be resumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. Monitoring of pituitary function and hormone levels should continue to ensure appropriate hormone replacement is utilised.

## Diabetes mellitus

For symptomatic diabetes, Opdualag should be withheld, and insulin replacement should be initiated as needed. Monitoring of blood sugar should continue to ensure appropriate insulin replacement is utilised. Opdualag must be permanently discontinued for life-threatening diabetes.

## Immune-related skin adverse reactions

Severe rash has been observed with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab (see section 4.8). Opdualag should be withheld for Grade 3 rash and discontinued for Grade 4 rash. Severe rash should be managed with high-dose corticosteroid at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents.

Rare cases of SJS and TEN, some of them with fatal outcome, have been observed with nivolumab monotherapy and could potentially occur with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab. If symptoms or signs of SJS or TEN are suspected, Opdualag should be withheld and the patient referred to a specialised unit for assessment and treatment. If the patient has confirmed SJS or TEN with the use of Opdualag, permanent discontinuation of treatment is recommended (see section 4.2).

Caution should be used when considering the use of Opdualag in a patient who has previously experienced a severe or life-threatening skin adverse reaction on prior treatment with other immune-stimulatory anticancer agents.

## Immune-related myocarditis

Severe immune-related myocarditis has been observed with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab. The diagnosis of myocarditis requires a high index of suspicion. Patients with cardiac or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cardio-pulmonary symptoms should be assessed for potential myocarditis. If myocarditis is suspected, prompt initiation of a high dose of steroids (prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day) and prompt cardiology consultation with diagnostic workup according to current clinical guidelines should be initiated. Once a diagnosis of myocarditis is established, Opdualag should be withheld or permanently discontinued as described below.

For Grade 3 or 4 myocarditis, Opdualag must be permanently discontinued, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents (see section 4.2).

For Grade 2 myocarditis, Opdualag should be withheld and corticosteroids initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalent. Upon improvement, resumption of Opdualag may be considered after corticosteroid taper. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should be increased to 2 to 4 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents, and Opdualag must be permanently discontinued (see section 4.2).

## Other immune-related adverse reactions

The following clinically significant immune-related adverse reactions have been rarely reported in patient treated with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab: uveitis, pancreatitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myositis/rhabdomyolysis, myasthenia gravis, encephalitis, haemolytic anaemia, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH).

The following additional clinically significant immune-related adverse reactions have been rarely reported with nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab in combination with other approved agents: demyelination, autoimmune neuropathy (including facial and abducens nerve paresis), myasthenic syndrome, aseptic meningitis, gastritis, sarcoidosis, duodenitis, hypoparathyroidism, and cystitis noninfective.

For suspected immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm aetiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, Opdualag should be withheld and corticosteroids administered. Upon improvement, Opdualag may be resumed after corticosteroid taper. Opdualag must be permanently discontinued for any severe immune-related adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-related adverse reaction.

## Other important warnings and precautions, including class effects

Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Treatment with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. The benefit of treatment with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab versus the risk of possible organ rejection should be considered in these patients.

Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has been observed with nivolumab as monotherapy, nivolumab in combination with relatlimab and nivolumab in combination with other agents with a fatal event reported with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab. Caution should be taken when administering nivolumab in combination with relatlimab. If HLH is confirmed, administration of nivolumab in combination with relatlimab should be discontinued and treatment for HLH initiated.

In patients treated with nivolumab before or after allogeneic Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT), rapid-onset and severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), some with fatal outcome, have been reported. Treatment with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab may increase the risk of severe GVHD and death in patients who have had prior allogeneic HSCT, mainly in those with prior history of GVHD. The benefit of treatment with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab versus the possible risk should be considered in these patients.

## Infusion reactions

Severe infusion reactions have been reported in clinical studies of nivolumab in combination with relatlimab (see section 4.8). In case of a severe or life-threatening infusion reaction, Opdualag infusion must be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy administered. Patients with mild or moderate

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

infusion reaction may receive Opdualag with close monitoring and preventative treatment according to local guidelines for prophylaxis of infusion reactions.

## Patients excluded from pivotal advanced melanoma clinical study

Patients with active autoimmune disease, medical conditions requiring systemic treatment with moderate or high dose corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medicinal products, uveal melanoma, active or untreated brain, or leptomeningeal metastases, and those with a history of myocarditis, elevated troponin levels &gt; 2 times ULN or ECOG performance status score ≥ 2, were excluded from the pivotal clinical study of nivolumab in combination with relatlimab. In the absence of data, nivolumab in combination with relatlimab should be used with caution in these populations after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis.

## Patient card

The prescriber must discuss the risks of Opdualag therapy with the patient. The patient will be provided with the patient card and instructed to carry the card at all times.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Nivolumab and relatlimab are both human monoclonal antibodies and as such, no interaction studies have been conducted. As monoclonal antibodies are not metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes or other active substances metabolising enzymes, inhibition or induction of these enzymes by co-administered medicinal products is not anticipated to affect the pharmacokinetics of relatlimab or nivolumab.

Nivolumab and relatlimab are not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of other active substances that are metabolised by CYP enzymes given the lack of significant modulation of cytokines by nivolumab and relatlimab and therefore lack of effect on expression of cytochrome P450 enzyme.

## Systemic immunosuppression

The use of systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants at baseline, before starting nivolumab in combination with relatlimab, should be avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity. However, systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants can be used after starting nivolumab in combination with relatlimab to treat immune-related adverse reactions.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception

Opdualag is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception unless the clinical benefit outweighs the potential risk. Effective contraception should be used for at least 5 months following the last dose of Opdualag.

## Pregnancy

There is a limited amount of data from the use of nivolumab in combination with relatlimab in pregnant women. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, nivolumab in combination with relatlimab can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Studies in animals receiving nivolumab have shown embryofoetal toxicity (see section 5.3). Human IgG4 is known to cross the placental barrier and nivolumab and relatlimab are an IgG4; therefore, nivolumab and relatlimab have the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. Opdualag is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception unless the clinical benefit outweighs the potential risk.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether nivolumab and/or relatlimab are excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon afterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded during this short period. Afterwards, Opdualag could be used during breast-feeding if clinically needed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility

Studies to evaluate the effect of nivolumab and/or relatlimab on fertility have not been performed. Thus, the effect of nivolumab and/or relatlimab on male and female fertility is unknown.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Opdualag has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Because of potential adverse reactions such as fatigue and dizziness (see section 4.8), patients should be advised to use caution when driving or operating machines until they are certain that Opdualag does not adversely affect them.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Nivolumab in combination with relatlimab is associated with immune-related adverse reactions (see 'Description of selected adverse reactions' below). The management guidelines for these adverse reactions are described in section 4.4.

The most common adverse reactions are fatigue (41%), musculoskeletal pain (32%), rash (29%), arthralgia (26%), diarrhoea (26%), pruritus (26%), headache (20%), nausea (19%), cough (16%), decreased appetite (16%), hypothyroidism (16%), abdominal pain (14%), vitiligo (13%), pyrexia (12%), constipation (11%), urinary tract infection (11%), dyspnoea (10%), and vomiting (10%).

The most common serious adverse reactions are adrenal insufficiency (1.4%), anaemia (1.4%), back pain (1.1%), colitis (1.1%), diarrhoea (1.1%), myocarditis (1.1%), pneumonia (1.1%), and urinary tract infection (1.1%). Incidences of Grade 3-5 adverse reactions in patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma were 43% for nivolumab in combination with relatlimab and 35% for nivolumab treated patients.

## Tabulated summary of adverse reactions

The safety of nivolumab in combination with relatlimab has been evaluated in 355 patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma (study CA224047). Adverse reactions reported in the dataset for patients treated with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab, with a median follow-up of 19.94 months, are presented in Table 2. The frequencies included above and in Table 2 are based on all-cause adverse event frequencies. These reactions are presented by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); very rare (&lt; 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01FY02.

## Mechanism of action

Opdualag is a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of nivolumab, a programmed death-1 inhibitor (anti-PD-1) and relatlimab, a lymphocyte-activation gene-3 inhibitor (anti-LAG-3).

Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumours, and signalling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T cell immune surveillance of tumours. Nivolumab is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor, blocks interaction with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 and reduces PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumour immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumour models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumour growth.

Relatlimab is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to the LAG-3 receptor, blocks its interaction with ligands, including MHC II, and reduces LAG-3 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response. Antagonism of this pathway promotes T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion.

The combination of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and relatlimab (anti-LAG-3) results in increased T-cell activation compared to the activity of either antibody alone. In murine syngeneic tumour models, LAG-3 blockade potentiates the anti-tumour activity of PD-1 blockage, inhibiting tumour growth and promoting tumour regression.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Randomised phase 2/3 study of nivolumab in combination with relatlimab vs. nivolumab in patients with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable melanoma (CA224047)

The safety and efficacy of nivolumab in combination with relatlimab for the treatment of patients with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable melanoma were evaluated in a phase 2/3, randomised, double-blinded study (CA224047). The study included patients with ECOG performance status score 0 or 1, and histologically confirmed stage III (unresectable) or stage IV melanoma per American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) version 8. Patients were allowed to have received prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant melanoma therapy (anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4, or BRAF-MEK therapy was allowed as long as there was at least 6 months between the last dose of therapy and date of recurrence; interferon therapy was allowed as long as the last dose was at least 6 weeks prior to randomisation). Patients with active autoimmune disease, a history of myocarditis, elevated troponin levels &gt; 2 times ULN, or ECOG performance status score ≥ 2, medical conditions requiring systemic treatment with moderate or high dose corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medicinal products, uveal melanoma, and active or untreated brain or leptomeningeal metastases were excluded from the study (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total of 714 patients were randomised to receive either nivolumab in combination with relatlimab (n = 355), or nivolumab (n = 359). Patients in the combination arm received 480 mg nivolumab/160 mg relatlimab over 60 minutes every 4 weeks. Patients in the nivolumab arm received nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by tumour PD-L1 ( ≥ 1% vs. &lt; 1) using PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx test, and LAG-3 expression ( ≥ 1% vs. &lt; 1) as determined by an analytically validated LAG-3 IHC assay, BRAF V600 mutation status, and M stage per the AJCC version 8 staging system (M0/M1any[0] vs. M1any[1]). Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tumour assessments, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), version 1.1, were conducted 12 weeks after randomisation and continued every 8 weeks up to 52 weeks and then every 12 weeks until disease progression or treatment discontinuation, whichever occurred later. The primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival determined by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR). The secondary efficacy outcome measures were overall survival (OS), and overall response rate (ORR) by BICR. The hierarchical statistical testing order was PFS followed by OS and then ORR. The primary and secondary outcome measures were evaluated in the intention to treat (ITT) population. No formal testing of ORR was conducted since the formal comparison of OS was not statistically significant.

Baseline characteristics in the ITT population were balanced between the two groups. The median age was 63 years (range: 20-94) with 47% ≥ 65 years of age and 1 9% ≥ 75 years of age. The majority of patients were white (97%) and male (58%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (67%) or 1 (33%). The majority of the patients had AJCC Stage IV disease (92%); 38.9% had M1c, 2.4% had M1d disease, 8.7% had prior systemic therapies, 36% had a baseline LDH level greater than ULN at study entry. Thirty nine percent of patients had BRAF mutation-positive melanoma, 75% had LAG-3 ≥ 1% and 41% of patients had PD-L1 ≥ 1% tumour cell membrane expression. Among patients with quantifiable tumour PD-L1 expression, the distribution of patients was balanced across the two treatment groups. The demographics and baseline disease characteristics in patients with PD-L1 expression &lt; 1% were generally balanced between the treatment arms.

At primary analysis in the ITT population, with median follow-up of 13.21 months (range: 0-33.1 months), a statistically significant improvement in PFS was observed with a median PFS of 10.12 months in the nivolumab in combination with relatlimab group as compared with 4.63 months in the nivolumab group (HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.92; p = 0.0055). At the time of the pre-specified final OS analysis in the ITT population, with median follow up of 19.3 months, OS was not statistically significant (HR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.64, 1.01).

## Pre-specified subgroup analysis by PD-L1 expression &lt; 1%

The key efficacy results for the subgroup of patients with tumour PD-L1 expression &lt; 1% from an exploratory analysis with median follow-up of 17.78 months (range: 0.26-40.64 months) are summarised in Table 3.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics (PK) of relatlimab following the administration of nivolumab in combination with relatlimab was characterised in patients with various cancers who received relatlimab doses of 20 to 800 mg every 2 weeks and 160 to 1440 mg every 4 weeks either as a monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab doses of 80 or 240 mg every 2 weeks or 480 mg every 4 weeks.

Steady-state concentrations of relatlimab were reached by 16 weeks with an every 4-week regimen and the systemic accumulation was 1.9-fold. The average concentration (Cavg) of relatlimab after the first dose increased dose proportionally at doses ≥ 160 mg every 4 weeks.

Table 4: Geometric mean (CV%) of nivolumab and relatlimab steady-state exposures following 480 mg nivolumab and 160 mg relatlimab fixed-dose combination every 4 weeks

|            | C max (μg/mL)   | C min (μg/mL)   | C avg (μg/mL)   |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Relatlimab | 62.2 (30.1)     | 15.3 (64.3)     | 28.8 (44.8)     |
| Nivolumab  | 187 (32.9)      | 59.7 (58.6)     | 94.4 (43.3)     |

Based on population PK analyses, the nivolumab and relatlimab FDC infusion duration of 30 min and 60 min were predicted to produce similar (&lt; 1% different) exposures of nivolumab and relatlimab.

In CA224047, the nivolumab geometric mean Cmin at steady state in the nivolumab in combination with relatlimab arm was similar to the nivolumab arm with a geometric mean ratio of 0.931 (95% CI: 0.855-1.013).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Distribution

The geometric mean value (CV%) for nivolumab volume of distribution at steady state is 6.65 L (19.2%) and relatlimab is 6.65 L (19.8%).

## Biotransformation

Nivolumab and relatlimab are therapeutic mAb IgG4 that are expected to be catabolised into small peptides, amino acids, and small carbohydrates by lysosome or receptor-mediated endocytosis.

## Elimination

Nivolumab clearance is 21.1% lower [geometric mean (CV%), 7.57 mL/h (40.1%)] at steady state than that after the first dose [9.59 mL/h (40.3%)] and the terminal half-life (t1/2) is 26.5 days (36.4%).

Relatlimab clearance is 9.7% lower [geometric mean (CV%), 5.48 mL/h (41.3%)] at steady state than that after the first dose [6.06 mL/h (38.9%)]. Following administration of relatlimab 160 mg and nivolumab 480 mg administered every 4 weeks, the geometric mean (CV%) effective half-life (t1/2) of relatlimab is 26.2 days (37%).

## Special populations

A population PK analysis suggested that the following factors had no clinically important effect on the clearance of nivolumab and relatlimab: age (range: 17 to 92 years), sex, [male (1056) and female (657)], or race [Caucasian (1655), African American (167) and Asian (41)]. The body weight (range: 37 to 170 kg) was a significant covariate on the nivolumab and relatlimab PK, however, there is no clinically relevant impact based on exposure-response analysis.

## Paediatric population

Limited data suggest that nivolumab clearance and volume of distribution in adolescent subjects with solid tumours were 36% and 16% lower, respectively, than those of adult reference patients. It is unknown if the same holds for melanoma patients and if relatlimab clearance and volume of distribution are also lower in adolescents than adults. However, based on population PK simulations, the exposure of nivolumab and relatlimab in adolescents weighing at least 30 kg are expected to result in similar safety and efficacy to that of adults of the same weight, at the same recommended dose.

## Renal impairment

The effect of renal impairment on the clearance of nivolumab and relatlimab was evaluated by a population PK analysis in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. No clinically important differences in the clearance of nivolumab or relatlimab were found between patients with renal impairment and patients with normal renal function.

## Hepatic impairment

The effect of hepatic impairment on the clearance of nivolumab and relatlimab was evaluated by population PK analysis in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin [TB] less than or equal to upper limit of normal [ULN] and AST greater than ULN or TB greater than 1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) or moderate hepatic impairment (TB greater than 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) compared to patients with normal hepatic function. No clinically important differences in the clearance of nivolumab or relatlimab were found between patients with hepatic impairment and patients with normal hepatic function.

## Immunogenicity

The observed low incidence rate of treatment emergent anti-nivolumab antibody and treatment emergent anti-relatlimab antibody had no effects on PK of nivolumab and relatlimab.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Nivolumab in combination with relatlimab

No animal studies were conducted with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab to evaluate potential carcinogenicity, genotoxicity or reproductive and developmental toxicity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a 1-month study in monkeys dosed with nivolumab and relatlimab, inflammation within the central nervous system (choroid plexus, vasculature, meninges, spinal cord) and the reproductive tract (epididymis, seminal vesicles and testes) was observed. Although safety margins were not established for these effects with the combination, they occurred at doses that suppose exposure levels significantly higher (13 folds for nivolumab and 97 folds for relatlimab) than those reached in patients.

## Relatlimab

There are no available animal data on effect of relatlimab on pregnancy and reproduction. In a embryo-foetal toxicity study in mice using murine anti-LAG-3 antibodies, no maternal or developmental effects were observed. The effects of relatlimab on prenatal and postnatal development have not been evaluated; however, based on the mechanism of action, blockade of LAG-3 with relatlimab can have a similar negative effect as nivolumab on pregnancy. There were no fertility studies performed with relatlimab.

## Nivolumab

Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and to increase foetal loss. The effects of nivolumab on prenatal and postnatal development were evaluated in monkeys that received nivolumab twice weekly from the onset of organogenesis in the first trimester through delivery, at exposure levels either 8 or 35 times higher than those observed at the clinical dose of 3 mg/kg of nivolumab (based on AUC). There was a dose-dependent increase in foetal losses and increased neonatal mortality beginning in the third trimester.

The remaining offspring of nivolumab-treated females survived to scheduled termination, with no treatment-related clinical signs, alterations to normal development, organ-weight effects, or gross and microscopic pathology changes. Results for growth indices, as well as teratogenic, neurobehavioral, immunological, and clinical pathology parameters throughout the 6-month postnatal period were comparable to the control group. However, based on their mechanism of action, foetal exposure to nivolumab, and, similarly, relatlimab, may increase the risk of developing immune-related disorders or altering the normal immune response and immune-related disorders have been reported in PD-1 and PD-1/LAG-3 knockout mice. Fertility studies have not been performed with nivolumab.

From a microbiological point of view, the prepared solution for infusion, regardless of the diluent, should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C, unless preparation has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions (see section 6.6).

## 6.4 Special precautions for storage

Store in a refrigerator (2 °C-8 °C).

Do not freeze.

Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

The unopened vials can be stored at controlled room temperature (up to 25 °C) for up to 72 hours.

For storage conditions after preparation of the infusion, see section 6.3.

## 6.5 Nature and contents of container

Pack of one 25 mL vial (Type I glass), with a stopper (coated butyl rubber) and a yellow flip-off aluminium seal. Each vial is filled with 21.3 mL of solution, which includes an overfill of 1.3 mL.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

Opdualag is supplied as a single-dose vial and does not contain any preservatives. Preparation should be performed by trained personnel in accordance with good practices rules, especially with respect to asepsis.

Opdualag can be used for intravenous administration either:

-  without dilution, after transfer to an infusion container using an appropriate sterile syringe; or
-  after diluting according to the following instructions:
-  the final infusion concentration should range between 3 mg/mL of nivolumab and 1 mg/mL of relatlimab to 12 mg/mL of nivolumab and 4 mg/mL of relatlimab
-  the total volume of infusion must not exceed 160 mL. For patients weighing less than 40 kg, the total volume of infusion should not exceed 4 mL per kilogram of patient weight.

Opdualag concentrate may be diluted with either:

-  sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection; or
-  50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection.

## Preparing the infusion

-  Inspect the Opdualag concentrate for particulate matter or discolouration. Do not shake the vial. Opdualag is a clear to opalescent, colourless to slightly yellow solution. Discard the vial if the solution is cloudy, discoloured, or contains extraneous particulate matter.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Withdraw the required volume of Opdualag concentrate using an appropriate sterile syringe and transfer the concentrate into a sterile, intravenous container (ethylvinyl acetate (EVA), polyvinyl chloride [PVC], or polyolefin).
-  If applicable, dilute Opdualag solution with the required volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection. For ease of preparation, the concentrate can also be transferred directly into a pre-filled bag containing the appropriate volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection.
-  Gently mix the infusion by manual rotation. Do not shake.

## Administration

Opdualag infusion must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection.

Administer the Opdualag infusion intravenously over a period of 30 minutes. Use of an infusion set and an in-line or add-on, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding filter (pore size of 0.2 μ m to 1.2 μm ) is recommended.

Opdualag infusion is compatible with EVA, PVC and polyolefin containers, PVC infusion sets and in-line filters with polyethersulfone (PES), nylon, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes with pore sizes of 0.2 μ m to 1.2 μ m.

Do not co-administer other medicinal products through the same infusion line.

After administration of the Opdualag dose, flush the line with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection.

## Disposal

Do not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## 1. What Opdualag is and what it is used for

Opdualag is a cancer medicine used to treat advanced melanoma (a type of skin cancer that can spread elsewhere in the body). It can be used in adults and in adolescents 12 years of age and older.

Opdualag contains two active substances: nivolumab and relatlimab. Both active substances are monoclonal antibodies, proteins designed to recognise and attach to a specific target substance in the body. Nivolumab attaches to a target protein called PD 1. Relatlimab attaches to a target protein called LAG-3.

PD 1 and LAG-3 can switch off the activity of T cells (a type of white blood cell that forms part of the immune system, the body's natural defences). By attaching to the two proteins, nivolumab and relatlimab block their actions and prevent them from switching off your T cells. This helps increase the T cell activity against the melanoma cancer cells.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Opdualag

## You should not be given Opdualag

-  if you are allergic to nivolumab, relatlimab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). Talk to your doctor if you are not sure.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor before you get Opdualag as it may cause:

-  Problems with your lungs such as breathing difficulties or cough. These may be signs of inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease).
-  Diarrhoea (watery, loose or soft stools) or inflammation of the intestines (colitis) with symptoms such as stomach pain and mucus or blood in stool.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis). Signs and symptoms of hepatitis may include abnormal liver function tests, eye or skin yellowing (jaundice), pain in the right side of your stomach area, or tiredness.
-  Inflammation of or problems with your kidneys. Signs and symptoms may include abnormal kidney function tests, or decrease in amount of urine.
-  Problems with your hormone producing glands (including the pituitary, thyroid and adrenal glands), which may affect how these glands work. Signs and symptoms that these glands are not working properly may include fatigue (extreme tiredness), weight change or headache and visual disturbances.
-  Diabetes including a serious, sometimes life-threatening problem due to acid in the blood produced from diabetes (diabetic ketoacidosis). Symptoms may include feeling more hungry or thirsty than usual, need to urinate more often, weight loss, feeling tired or having difficulty thinking clearly, breath that smells sweet or fruity, a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, and deep or fast breathing.
-  Inflammation of the skin that can lead to severe skin reaction (known as toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome). Signs and symptoms of severe skin reaction may include rash, itching, and peeling of the skin (possibly fatal).
-  Inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis). Signs and symptoms may include chest pain, irregular and/or rapid heartbeat, fatigue, swelling in the ankles or shortness of breath.
-  Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. A rare disease in which your immune system makes too many otherwise normal infection-fighting cells called histiocytes and lymphocytes. Symptoms may include enlarged liver and/or spleen, skin rash, swollen lymph glands, breathing problems, easy bruising, kidney abnormalities, and heart problems.
-  Solid organ transplant rejection.
-  Graft-versus-host disease after stem cell transplantation (where the transplanted cells from a donor attack your own cells). If you have received one of these transplants, your doctor will consider whether you should receive treatment with Opdualag. Graft-versus-host disease can be severe and can lead to death.
-  Infusion reactions, which may include shortness of breath, itching or rash, dizziness or fever.

Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of these signs or symptoms or if they get worse. Do not try to treat your symptoms with other medicines on your own. Your doctor may

-  give you other medicines to prevent complications and reduce your symptoms,
-  skip your next dose of Opdualag,
-  or stop your treatment with Opdualag altogether.

Please note that these signs and symptoms are sometimes delayed and may develop weeks or months after your last dose. Before treatment, your doctor will check your general health. You will also have blood tests during your treatment.

Check with your doctor or nurse before you are given Opdualag if:

-  you have an active autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells);
-  you have melanoma of the eye;
-  you have been told that your cancer has spread to your brain;
-  you have been taking medicines to suppress your immune system.

Opdualag acts on your immune system. It may cause inflammation in parts of your body. Your risk of these side effects may be higher if you already have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells). You may also experience frequent flares of your autoimmune disease, which in the majority of cases are mild.

## Children and adolescents

Opdualag should not be used in children below 12 years of age.

## Other medicines and Opdualag

Before you are given Opdualag, tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines that suppress your immune system, such as corticosteroids, since these medicines may interfere with the effect of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Opdualag. However, once you are treated with Opdualag, your doctor may give you corticosteroids to reduce any possible side effects that you may have during your treatment.

Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or are planning to take any other medicines. Do not take any other medicines during your treatment without talking to your doctor first.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.

Do not use Opdualag if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically tells you to. The effects of Opdualag in pregnant women are not known, but it is possible that the active substances, nivolumab and relatlimab, could harm an unborn baby.

-  You must use effective contraception while you are being treated with Opdualag and for at least 5 months following the last dose of Opdualag, if you are a woman who could become pregnant.
-  If you become pregnant while using Opdualag tell your doctor.

It is not known whether Opdualag can pass into breast milk and affect a baby that is breast-fed. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks before breast-feeding during or after treatment with Opdualag.

## Driving and using machines

Opdualag has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines; however, use caution when performing these activities until you are sure that Opdualag does not adversely affect you.

## Patient card

You will also find key messages from this package leaflet on the patient card you have been given by your doctor. It is important that you keep this patient card at all times and show it to your partner or caregivers.

## 3. How to use Opdualag

## How much Opdualag is given

The recommended dose by infusion in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older is 480 mg nivolumab and 160 mg relatlimab every 4 weeks. This dose is established for adolescent patients weighing at least 30 kg.

Depending on your dose, the appropriate amount of Opdualag may be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection before use. Opdualag may also be used undiluted.

## How Opdualag is given

You will receive treatment with Opdualag in a hospital or clinic, under the supervision of an experienced doctor.

Opdualag will be given to you as an infusion (a drip) into a vein, every 4 weeks. Each infusion takes about 30 minutes to give.

Your doctor will continue treating you with Opdualag for as long as you keep benefitting from it or until side effects become too severe.

## If you miss a dose of Opdualag

It is very important for you to keep all your appointments to receive Opdualag. If you miss an appointment, ask your doctor when to schedule your next dose.

## If you stop using Opdualag

Stopping your treatment may stop the effect of the medicine. Do not stop treatment with Opdualag unless you have discussed this with your doctor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

From a microbiological point of view, the prepared solution for infusion, regardless of the diluent, should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C, unless preparation has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.

## Disposal

Do not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for nivolumab / relatlimab, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on immune-mediated adverse reactions in patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease is at least a reasonable possibility from the literature, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between nivolumab / relatlimab and immune-mediated adverse reactions in patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing nivolumab / relatlimab should be amended accordingly.

In view of available data on myasthenia gravis from clinical trials, spontaneous reports, literature and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between nivolumab / relatlimab and myasthenia gravis is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing nivolumab / relatlimab should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for nivolumab / relatlimab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing nivolumab / relatlimab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
