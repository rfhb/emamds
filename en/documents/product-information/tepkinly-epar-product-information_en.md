Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and herpes virus infections is strongly recommended especially during concurrent use of steroids.

Tepkinly should be administered to adequately hydrated patients.

It is strongly recommended that all patients adhere to the following fluid guidelines during Cycle 1, unless medically contraindicated:

- 2-3 L of fluid intake during the 24 hours prior to each epcoritamab administration
- Hold antihypertensive medications for 24 hours prior to each epcoritamab administration
- Administer 500 ml isotonic intravenous (IV) fluids on the day of epcoritamab prior to dose administration; AND
- 2-3 L of fluid intake during the 24 hours following each epcoritamab administration.

Patients at an increased risk for clinical tumour lysis syndrome (CTLS) are recommended to receive hydration and prophylactic treatment with a uric acid lowering agent.

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CRS and/or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) and managed per current practice guidelines following epcoritamab administration. Patients should be counselled on the signs and symptoms associated with CRS and ICANS and on seeking immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms occur at any time (see section 4.4).

Patients with DLBCL should be hospitalised for 24 hours after administration of the Cycle 1 Day 15 dose of 48 mg to monitor for signs and symptoms of CRS and/or ICANS.

## Dose modifications and management of adverse reactions

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)

Patients treated with epcoritamab may develop CRS.

Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. If CRS is suspected, manage according to the recommendations in Table 4. Patients who experience CRS should be monitored more frequently during next scheduled epcoritamab administration.

## Missed or delayed dose

## Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

A re-priming Cycle (identical to Cycle 1 with standard CRS prophylaxis) is required:

- If there are more than 8 days between the priming dose (0.16 mg) and intermediate dose (0.8 mg), or
- If there are more than 14 days between the intermediate dose (0.8 mg) and first full dose (48 mg), or
- If there are more than 6 weeks between full doses (48 mg)

After the re-priming cycle, the patient should resume treatment with Day 1 of the next planned treatment cycle (subsequent to the cycle during which the dose was delayed).

## Follicular lymphoma

A re-priming Cycle (identical to Cycle 1 with standard CRS prophylaxis) is required:

- If there are more than 8 days between the priming dose (0.16 mg) and intermediate dose (0.8 mg), or
- If there are more than 8 days between the intermediate dose (0.8 mg) and the second intermediate dose (3 mg), or
- If there are more than 14 days between the second intermediate dose (3 mg) and first full dose (48 mg), or
- If there are more than 6 weeks between any two full doses (48 mg)

After the re-priming cycle, the patient should resume treatment with Day 1 of the next planned treatment cycle (subsequent to the cycle during which the dose was delayed).

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

Dose adjustments are not considered necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Epcoritamab has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment to end stage renal disease. No dose recommendations can be made for patients with severe renal impairment to end-stage renal disease (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Dose adjustments are not considered necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Epcoritamab has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (defined as total bilirubin &gt; 3 times ULN and any AST) and data are limited in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (defined as total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST). No dose recommendations can be made for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is necessary in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Tepkinly in children aged less than 18 years of age have not yet been established. No data are available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Method of administration

Tepkinly is for subcutaneous use. It should be administered by subcutaneous injection only, preferably in the lower part of the abdomen or the thigh. Change of injection site from left to right side or vice versa is recommended especially during the weekly administration schedule (i.e., Cycles 1-3) .

For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)

CRS, which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in patients receiving epcoritamab. The most common signs and symptoms of CRS include pyrexia, hypotension and hypoxia. Other signs and symptoms of CRS in more than two patients include chills, tachycardia, headache and dyspnoea.

Most CRS events occurred in Cycle 1 and were associated with the first full dose of epcoritamab. Administer prophylactic corticosteroids to mitigate the risk of CRS (see section 4.2).

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CRS following epcoritamab administration.

At the first signs or symptoms of CRS, treatment should be instituted of supportive care with tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids as appropriate (see section 4.2, Table 4). Patients should be counselled on the signs and symptoms associated with CRS and patients should be instructed to contact their healthcare professional and seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms occur at any time. Management of CRS may require either temporary delay or discontinuation of epcoritamab based on the severity of CRS (see section 4.2).

Patients with DLBCL should be hospitalised for 24 hours after administration of the Cycle 1 Day 15 dose of 48 mg to monitor for signs and symptoms of CRS.

## Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)

Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), including fatal cases, have been reported in patients receiving epcoritamab. HLH is a life-threatening syndrome characterised by fever, skin rash, lymphadenopathy, hepato- and/or splenomegaly and cytopenias. HLH should be considered when the presentation of CRS is atypical or prolonged. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of HLH. For suspected HLH, epcoritamab must be interrupted for diagnostic workup and treatment for HLH initiated.

## Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS)

ICANS, including fatal events, have occurred in patients receiving epcoritamab. ICANS may manifest as aphasia, altered level of consciousness, impairment of cognitive skills, motor weakness, seizures, and cerebral oedema.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The majority of cases of ICANS occurred within Cycle 1 of epcoritamab treatment, however some occurred with delayed onset.

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of ICANS following epcoritamab administration. At the first signs or symptoms of ICANS, treatment with corticosteroids and non-sedating-anti-seizure medicinal products should be instituted as appropriate (see section 4.2, Table 5). Patients should be counselled on the signs and symptoms of ICANS and that the onset of events may be delayed. Patients should be instructed to contact their healthcare professional and seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms occur at any time. Epcoritamab should be delayed or discontinued as recommended (see section 4.2).

Patients with DLBCL should be hospitalised for 24 hours after administration of the Cycle 1 Day 15 dose of 48 mg to monitor for signs and symptoms of ICANS.

## Serious infections

Treatment with epcoritamab may lead to an increased risk of infections. Serious or fatal infections were observed in patients treated with epcoritamab in clinical studies (see section 4.8).

Administration of epcoritamab should be avoided in patients with clinically significant active systemic infections.

As appropriate, prophylactic antimicrobials should be administered prior to and during treatment with epcoritamab (see section 4.2). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection, before and after epcoritamab administration, and treated appropriately. In the event of febrile neutropenia, patients should be evaluated for infection and managed with antibiotics, fluids and other supportive care, according to local guidelines.

Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal cases, have been reported in patients treated with epcoritamab who have also received prior treatment with other immunosuppressive medications. If neurological symptoms suggestive of PML occur during epcoritamab therapy, treatment with epcoritamab should be discontinued and appropriate diagnostic measures initiated.

## Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS)

TLS has been reported in patients receiving epcoritamab (see section 4.8). Patients at an increased risk for TLS are recommended to receive hydration and prophylactic treatment with a uric acid lowering agent. Patients should be monitored for signs or symptoms of TLS, especially patients with high tumour burden or rapidly proliferative tumours, and patients with reduced renal function. Patients should be monitored for blood chemistries and abnormalities should be managed promptly.

## Tumour flare

Tumour flare has been reported in patients treated with epcoritamab (see section 4.8). Manifestations could include localised pain and swelling. Consistent with the mechanism of action of epcoritamab, tumour flare is likely due to the influx of T-cells into tumour sites following epcoritamab administration.

There are no specific risk factors for tumour flare that have been identified; however, there is a heightened risk of compromise and morbidity due to mass effect secondary to tumour flare in patients with bulky tumours located in close proximity to airways and/or a vital organ. Patients treated with epcoritamab should be monitored and evaluated for tumour flare at critical anatomical sites.

## CD20-negative disease

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There are limited data available on patients with CD20-negative DLBCL and patients with CD20negative FL treated with epcoritamab and it is possible that patients with CD20-negative DLBCL and patients with CD20-negative FL may have less benefit compared to patients with CD20-positive DLBCL and patients with CD20-positive FL, respectively. The potential risks and benefits associated with treatment of patients with CD20-negative DLBCL and FL with epcoritamab should be considered.

## Patient card

The doctor must inform the patient of the risk of CRS and ICANS and any signs and symptoms of CRS and ICANS. Patients must be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs and symptoms of CRS and/or ICANS. Patients should be provided with a patient card and instructed to carry the card at all times. This card describes symptoms of CRS and ICANS which, if experienced, should prompt the patient to seek immediate medical attention.

## Immunisation

Live and/or live-attenuated vaccines should not be given during epcoritamab therapy. Studies have not been conducted in patients who received live vaccines.

## Excipients with known effect

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

This medicinal product contains 21.9 mg of sorbitol per vial, which is equivalent to 27.33 mg/ml.

This medicinal product contains 0.42 mg of polysorbate 80 per vial, equivalent to 0.4 mg/ml. Polysorbate 80 may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

Transient elevation of certain proinflammatory cytokines by epcoritamab may suppress CYP450 enzyme activities. On initiation of epcoritamab therapy in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, therapeutic monitoring should be considered.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females

Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with epcoritamab and for at least 4 months after the last dose. Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating epcoritamab treatment.

## Pregnancy

Based on its mechanism of action, epcoritamab may cause foetal harm, including B-cell lymphocytopenia and alterations in normal immune responses, when administered to pregnant women. There are no data on the use of epcoritamab in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with epcoritamab. IgG1 antibodies, such as epcoritamab, can cross the placenta resulting in foetal exposure. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a foetus. Epcoritamab is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

## Breast-feeding

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is not known whether epcoritamab is excreted in human milk or its effect on milk production. Since IgGs are known to be present in milk, neonatal exposure to epcoritamab may occur via lactational transfer. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with epcoritamab and for at least 4 months after the last dose.

## Fertility

No fertility studies have been conducted with epcoritamab (see section 5.3). The effect of epcoritamab on male and female fertility is unknown.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Epcoritamab has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Due to the potential for ICANS, patients receiving epcoritamab are at risk of altered level of consciousness (see section 4.4). Patients should be advised to exercise caution while (or avoid if symptomatic) driving, cycling or using heavy or potentially dangerous machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The  safety  of  epcoritamab  was  evaluated  in  a  non-randomised,  single-arm  GCT3013-01  study  in  382 patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (N=167), follicular lymphoma (N=129) and follicular lymphoma (3-step step-up dose schedule N=86) after two or more lines of systemic therapy and included all the patients who enrolled to the 48 mg dose and received at least one dose of epcoritamab. The following adverse reactions  have  been  reported  with  epcoritamab  during  clinical  studies  and  post marketing experience.

The median duration of exposure to epcoritamab was 4.9 months (range: &lt;1 to 30 months).

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were CRS, injection site reactions, fatigue, viral infection, neutropenia, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, and diarrhoea.

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 50% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reaction (≥ 10%) was cytokine release syndrome (34%). Fourteen patients (3.7%) experienced a fatal adverse reaction (pneumonia in 9 (2.4%) patients, viral infection in 4 (1.0%) patients, and ICANS in 1 (0.3%) patient).

Adverse reactions that led to discontinuation occurred in 6.8% of patients. Discontinuation of epcoritamab due to pneumonia occurred in 14 (3.7%) patients, viral infection in 8 (2.1%) patients, fatigue in 2 (0.5%) patients, and CRS, ICANS, or diarrhoea, in 1 (0.3%) patient each.

Dose delays due to adverse reactions occurred in 42% of patients. Adverse reactions leading to dose delays (≥ 3%) were viral infections (17%), CRS (11%), neutropenia (5.2%), pneumonia (4.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (4.2%), and pyrexia (3.7%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions for epcoritamab from clinical studies (Table 7) are listed by MedDRA system organ class and are based on the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); and very rare (&lt; 1/10 000). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

In the event of overdose, monitor the patient for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and administer appropriate supportive treatment.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates, ATC code: L01FX27

## Mechanism of action

Epcoritamab is a humanised IgG1-bispecific antibody that binds to a specific extracellular epitope of CD20 on B cells and to CD3 on T cells. The activity of epcoritamab is dependent upon simultaneous engagement of CD20-expressing cancer cells and CD3-expressing endogenous T cells by epcoritamab that induces specific T-cell activation and T-cell-mediated killing of CD20-expressing cells.

Epcoritamab Fc region is silenced to prevent target-independent immune effector mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CDC), and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP).

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Epcoritamab induced rapid and sustained depletion of circulating B-cells (defined as CD19 B-cell counts  ≤10 cell/µl) in the subjects who have detectable B cells at treatment initiation. There were 21% subjects (n=33) with DLBCL and 50% subjects (n=56) with FL who had detectable circulating B-cells at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment initiation. Transient reduction in circulating T cells was observed immediately after each dose in Cycle 1 and followed by T cell expansion in subsequent cycles.

In study GCT3013-01, following subcutaneous administration of epcoritamab at the recommended 2-step step-up dose schedule in patients with LBCL, transient and modest elevations of circulating levels of selected cytokines (IFN-γ, TNFα, IL-6, IL-2, and IL-10) occurred mostly after the first full dose (48 mg), with peak levels between 1 to 4 days post dose. Cytokine levels returned to baseline prior to the next full dose, however elevations of cytokines could also be observed after Cycle 1.

In study GCT3013-01, following subcutaneous administration of epcoritamab at the recommended 3-step step-up dose schedule in patients with FL, median IL-6 levels associated with CRS risk remained consistently low after each dose in Cycle 1 and beyond, particularly after the first full dose, compared to patients who received the 2-step step-up dose.

## Immunogenicity

Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were commonly detected. The incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs with the 2-step step-up dose schedule (0.16/0.8/48 mg) in the combined population of DLBCL and FL was 3.4% (3.4 % positive, 93.9% negative and 2.7% indeterminate, N=261 evaluable patients) and 3.3% (3.3% positive, 95% negative and 1.7% indeterminate, N= 60 evaluable patients), in studies GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04, respectively.

The incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs with the 3-step step-up dose schedule (0.16/0.8/3/48 mg) in the FL optimisation cohort was 7% (7% positive, 91.5% negative and 1.4% indeterminate, N=71 evaluable patients) in study GCT3013-01. A subject is classified as indeterminate if the patient is confirmed ADA positive at baseline but there is no confirmed positive on-treatment record or if confirmed ADA positive on treatment record titre are equal or lower than baseline.

No evidence of ADA impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety was observed, however, data are still limited. Neutralising antibodies were not evaluated.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

Study GCT3013-01 was an open-label, multi-cohort, multicentre, single-arm study that evaluated epcoritamab as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The study includes a dose escalation part and an expansion part. The expansion part of the study included an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (aNHL) cohort, an indolent NHL (iNHL) cohort and a mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL) cohort. The pivotal aNHL cohort consisted of patients with LBCL (N=157), including patients with DLBCL (N=139, 12 patients of which had MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6 rearrangements i.e., DH/TH), with high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) (N=9), with follicular lymphoma grade 3B (FL) (N=5) and patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) (N=4). In the DLBCL cohort, 29% (40/139) of patients had transformed DLBCL arising from indolent lymphoma. Patients included in the study were required to have documented CD20+ mature B-cell neoplasm according to WHO classification 2016 or WHO classification 2008 based on representative pathology report, failed prior autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or were ineligible for autologous HSCT, patients who had lymphocyte counts &lt; 5×10 9 /L, and patients with at least 1 prior anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody-containing therapy.

The study excluded patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement of lymphoma, prior treatment with allogeneic HSCT or solid organ transplant, chronic ongoing infectious diseases, any patients with known impaired T-cell immunity, a creatinine clearance of less than 45 ml/min, alanine aminotransferase &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal, cardiac ejection fraction less than 45%, and known clinically significant cardiovascular disease. Efficacy was evaluated in 139 patients with DLBCL who had received at least one dose of epcoritamab SC in cycles of 4 weeks, i.e., 28 days. Epcoritamab monotherapy was administered at the recommended 2-step step-up dose schedule as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Cycle 1: epcoritamab 0.16 mg on Day 1, 0.8 mg on Day 8, 48 mg on Day 15 and Day 22
- Cycles 2-3: epcoritamab 48 mg on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22
- Cycles 4-9: epcoritamab 48 mg on Days 1 and 15
- Cycles 10 and beyond: epcoritamab 48 mg on Day 1

Patients continued to receive epcoritamab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 8.

## Follicular lymphoma

Study GCT3013-01 was an open-label, multi-cohort, multicentre, single-arm trial that evaluated epcoritamab as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy. The study includes a dose escalation part, an expansion part and a 3-step step-up dose optimisation part. The expansion part of the study included an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (aNHL) cohort, an indolent NHL (iNHL) cohort and a mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL) cohort. The pivotal iNHL cohort, included patients with FL. Patients included in the study were required to have documented CD20+ mature B-cell neoplasm according to WHO classification 2016 or WHO classification 2008 based on representative pathology report with histologic confirmed FL 1-3A at initial diagnosis without clinical or pathological evidence of transformation. All patients had relapsed or refractory disease to the last prior line therapy and previously treated with at least 2 lines of systemic antineoplastic therapy, including at least 1 anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody-containing therapy and an alkylating agent or lenalidomide. The study excluded patients with CNS involvement of lymphoma , allogeneic HSCT or solid organ transplant, ongoing active infectious diseases, any patients with known impaired T-cell immunity, a creatinine clearance of less than 45 ml/min, alanine aminotransferase &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal and cardiac ejection fraction less than 45%. Efficacy was evaluated in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

128 patients who had received epcoritamab subcutaneously (SC) in cycles of 4 weeks, i.e., 28 days. Epcoritamab was administered as a monotherapy in a 2-step step-up dose schedule as follows:

- Cycle 1: epcoritamab 0.16 mg on Day 1, 0.8 mg on Day 8, 48 mg on Day 15 and 48 mg on Day 22
- Cycles 2-3: epcoritamab 48 mg on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22
- Cycles 4-9: epcoritamab 48 mg on Days 1 and 15
- Cycles 10 and beyond: epcoritamab 48 mg on Day 1

Patients continued to receive epcoritamab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The median number of cycles initiated was 8 and 60% received 6 cycles.

The demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 10.

## Conditional approval

This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called 'conditional approval' scheme. This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The population pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous administration of epcoritamab was described by a two-compartment model with first order subcutaneous absorption and target-mediated drug elimination. The moderate to high pharmacokinetic variability for epcoritamab was observed and characterised by inter-individual variability (IIV) ranging from 25.7% to 137.5% coefficient of variation (CV) for epcoritamab PK parameters.

In patients with LBCL in study GCT3013-01, based on individually estimated exposures using population pharmacokinetic modelling, following the recommended 2-step step-up dose schedule SC dose of epcoritamab 48 mg, the geometric mean (% CV) Cmax of epcoritamab is 10.8 mcg/ml (41.7%) and AUC0-7d is 68.9 day*mcg/ml (45.1%) at the end of the weekly dosing schedule. The Ctrough at Week 12 is 8.4 (53.3%) mcg/ml.The geometric mean (% CV) Cmax of epcoritamab is 7.52 mcg/ml (41.1%) and AUC0-14d is 82.6 day*mcg/ml (49.3%) at the end of q2w schedule. The Ctrough for q2W schedule is 4.1 (73.9%) mcg/ml.The geometric mean (% CV) Cmax of epcoritamab is 4.76 mcg/ml (51.6%) and AUC0-28d is 74.3 day*mcg/ml (69.5%) at steady state during the q4w schedule. The Ctrough for q4W schedule is 1.2 (130%) mcg/ml.

Exposure parameters of epcoritamab in patients with FL were consistent with the exposure parameters seen in the patients with LBCL. Epcoritamab exposures are similar between FL subjects who received the 3-step step-up dose schedule and 2-step step-up dose schedule except for transiently lower trough concentrations, as expected, at Cycle 1 Day 15 after the second intermediate dose (3 mg) with 3-step step-up dose schedule compared first full 48 mg dose with 2-step step-up dose schedule.

## Absorption

The peak concentrations occurred around 3-4 days (Tmax) in patients with LBCL receiving the 48 mg full dose.

## Distribution

The geometric mean (% CV) central volume of distribution is 8.27 l (27.5%) and apparent steady-state volume of distribution is 25.6 l (81.8%) based on population PK modelling.

## Biotransformation

The metabolic pathway of epcoritamab has not been directly studied. Like other protein therapeutics, epcoritamab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways.

## Elimination

Epcoritamab is expected to undergo saturable target mediated clearance. The geometric mean (% CV) clearance (l/day) is 0.441 (27.8%). The half-life of epcoritamab is concentration dependent. The population PK model-derived geometric mean half-life of full dose epcoritamab (48 mg) ranged from 22 to 25 days based on frequency of dosing.

## Special populations

No clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab (Cycle 1 AUC within approximately 36%) were observed based on age (20 to 89 years), sex, or race/ethnicity (white, Asian, and other), mild to moderate renal impairment creatinine clearance (CLcr ≥ 30 ml/min to CLcr &lt; 90 ml/min), and mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST &gt; ULN, or total bilirubin 1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) after accounting for differences in bodyweight. No patients with severe to end-stage renal disease (CLcr &lt; 30 ml/min) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt; 3 times ULN and any AST) have been studied. There is very limited data in moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST, N=1). Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab is unknown in these populations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Like other therapeutic proteins, body weight (39 to 172 kg) has a statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab. Based on exposure-response analysis and clinical data, considering the exposures in patients at either low body weight (e.g., 46 kg) or high body weight (e.g., 105 kg) and across body weight categories (&lt; 65 kg, 65-&lt; 85, ≥ 85), the effect on exposures is not clinically relevant.

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab in paediatric patients has not been established.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Animal pharmacology and/or toxicology

No reproductive or developmental toxicity studies in animals have been conducted with epcoritamab. Effects generally consistent with the pharmacologic mechanism of action of epcoritamab were observed in cynomolgus monkeys. These findings included dose-related adverse clinical signs (including vomiting, decreased activity, and mortality at high doses) and cytokine release, reversible hematologic alterations, reversible B-cell depletion in peripheral blood, and reversible decreased lymphoid cellularity in secondary lymphoid tissues.

## Mutagenicity

Mutagenicity studies have not been conducted with epcoritamab.

## Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with epcoritamab.

## Impairment of fertility

Animal fertility studies have not been conducted with epcoritamab, however, epcoritamab did not cause toxicological changes in the reproductive organs of male or female cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 1 mg/kg/week in intravenous general toxicity study of 5-week duration. The AUC exposures (timeaveraged over 7 days) at the high dose in cynomolgus monkeys were similar to those in patients (AUC07d) receiving the recommended dose.

Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and herpes virus infections is strongly recommended especially during concurrent use of steroids.

Tepkinly should be administered to adequately hydrated patients.

It is strongly recommended that all patients adhere to the following fluid guidelines during Cycle 1, unless medically contraindicated:

- 2-3 L of fluid intake during the 24 hours prior to each epcoritamab administration
- Hold antihypertensive medications for 24 hours prior to each epcoritamab administration
- Administer 500 ml isotonic intravenous (IV) fluids on the day of epcoritamab prior to dose administration; AND
- 2-3 L of fluid intake during the 24 hours following each epcoritamab administration.

Patients at an increased risk for clinical tumour lysis syndrome (CTLS) are recommended to receive hydration and prophylactic treatment with a uric acid lowering agent.

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CRS and/or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) and managed per current practice guidelines following epcoritamab administration. Patients should be counselled on the signs and symptoms associated with CRS and ICANS and on seeking immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms occur at any time (see section 4.4).

Patients with DLBCL should be hospitalised for 24 hours after administration of the Cycle 1 Day 15 dose of 48 mg to monitor for signs and symptoms of CRS and/or ICANS.

## Dose modifications and management of adverse reactions

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)

Patients treated with epcoritamab may develop CRS.

Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. If CRS is suspected, manage according to the recommendations in Table 4. Patients who experience CRS should be monitored more frequently during next scheduled epcoritamab administration.

## Missed or delayed dose

## Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

A re-priming Cycle (identical to Cycle 1 with standard CRS prophylaxis) is required:

- If there are more than 8 days between the priming dose (0.16 mg) and intermediate dose (0.8 mg), or
- If there are more than 14 days between the intermediate dose (0.8 mg) and first full dose (48 mg), or
- If there are more than 6 weeks between full doses (48 mg)

After the re-priming cycle, the patient should resume treatment with Day 1 of the next planned treatment cycle (subsequent to the cycle during which the dose was delayed).

## Follicular lymphoma

A re-priming Cycle (identical to Cycle 1 with standard CRS prophylaxis) is required:

- If there are more than 8 days between the priming dose (0.16 mg) and intermediate dose (0.8 mg), or
- If there are more than 8 days between the intermediate dose (0.8 mg) and the second intermediate dose (3 mg), or
- If there are more than 14 days between the second intermediate dose (3 mg) and first full dose (48 mg), or
- If there are more than 6 weeks between any two full doses (48 mg)

After the re-priming cycle, the patient should resume treatment with Day 1 of the next planned treatment cycle (subsequent to the cycle during which the dose was delayed).

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

Dose adjustments are not considered necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Epcoritamab has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment to end stage renal disease. No dose recommendations can be made for patients with severe renal impairment to end-stage renal disease (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Dose adjustments are not considered necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Epcoritamab has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (defined as total bilirubin &gt; 3 times ULN and any AST) and data are limited in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (defined as total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST). No dose recommendations can be made for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is necessary in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Tepkinly in children aged less than 18 years of age have not yet been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Tepkinly is for subcutaneous use. It should be administered by subcutaneous injection only, preferably in the lower part of the abdomen or the thigh. Change of injection site from left to right side or vice versa is recommended especially during the weekly administration schedule (i.e., Cycles 1-3) .

For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)

CRS, which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in patients receiving epcoritamab. The most common signs and symptoms of CRS include pyrexia, hypotension and hypoxia. Other signs and symptoms of CRS in more than two patients include chills, tachycardia, headache and dyspnoea.

Most CRS events occurred in Cycle 1 and were associated with the first full dose of epcoritamab. Administer prophylactic corticosteroids to mitigate the risk of CRS (see section 4.2).

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CRS following epcoritamab administration. At the first signs or symptoms of CRS, treatment should be instituted of supportive care with tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids as appropriate (see section 4.2, Table 4). Patients should be counselled on the signs and symptoms associated with CRS and patients should be instructed to contact their healthcare professional and seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms occur at any time. Management of CRS may require either temporary delay or discontinuation of epcoritamab based on the severity of CRS (see section 4.2).

Patients with DLBCL should be hospitalised for 24 hours after administration of the Cycle 1 Day 15 dose of 48 mg to monitor for signs and symptoms of CRS.

## Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)

Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), including fatal cases, have been reported in patients receiving epcoritamab. HLH is a life-threatening syndrome characterised by fever, skin rash, lymphadenopathy, hepato- and/or splenomegaly and cytopenias. HLH should be considered when the presentation of CRS is atypical or prolonged. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of HLH. For suspected HLH, epcoritamab must be interrupted for diagnostic workup and treatment for HLH initiated.

Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ICANS, including fatal events, have occurred in patients receiving epcoritamab. ICANS may manifest as aphasia, altered level of consciousness, impairment of cognitive skills, motor weakness, seizures, and cerebral oedema.

The majority of cases of ICANS occurred within Cycle 1 of epcoritamab treatment, however some occurred with delayed onset.

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of ICANS following epcoritamab administration. At the first signs or symptoms of ICANS, treatment with corticosteroids and non-sedating-anti-seizure medicinal products should be instituted as appropriate (see section 4.2, Table 5). Patients should be counselled on the signs and symptoms of ICANS and that the onset of events may be delayed. Patients should be instructed to contact their healthcare professional and seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms occur at any time. Epcoritamab should be delayed or discontinued as recommended (see section 4.2).

Patients with DLBCL should be hospitalised for 24 hours after administration of the Cycle 1 Day 15 dose of 48 mg to monitor for signs and symptoms of ICANS.

## Serious infections

Treatment with epcoritamab may lead to an increased risk of infections. Serious or fatal infections were observed in patients treated with epcoritamab in clinical studies (see section 4.8).

Administration of epcoritamab should be avoided in patients with clinically significant active systemic infections.

As appropriate, prophylactic antimicrobials should be administered prior to and during treatment with epcoritamab (see section 4.2). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection, before and after epcoritamab administration, and treated appropriately. In the event of febrile neutropenia, patients should be evaluated for infection and managed with antibiotics, fluids and other supportive care, according to local guidelines.

Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal cases, have been reported in patients treated with epcoritamab who have also received prior treatment with other immunosuppressive medications. If neurological symptoms suggestive of PML occur during epcoritamab therapy, treatment with epcoritamab should be discontinued and appropriate diagnostic measures initiated.

## Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS)

TLS has been reported in patients receiving epcoritamab (see section 4.8). Patients at an increased risk for TLS are recommended to receive hydration and prophylactic treatment with a uric acid lowering agent. Patients should be monitored for signs or symptoms of TLS, especially patients with high tumour burden or rapidly proliferative tumours, and patients with reduced renal function. Patients should be monitored for blood chemistries and abnormalities should be managed promptly.

## Tumour flare

Tumour flare has been reported in patients treated with epcoritamab (see section 4.8). Manifestations could include localised pain and swelling. Consistent with the mechanism of action of epcoritamab, tumour flare is likely due to the influx of T-cells into tumour sites following epcoritamab administration.

There are no specific risk factors for tumour flare that have been identified; however, there is a heightened risk of compromise and morbidity due to mass effect secondary to tumour flare in patients with bulky tumours located in close proximity to airways and/or a vital organ. Patients treated with epcoritamab should be monitored and evaluated for tumour flare at critical anatomical sites.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## CD20-negative disease

There are limited data available on patients with CD20-negative DLBCL and patients with CD20negative FL treated with epcoritamab, and it is possible that patients with CD20-negative DLBCL and patients with CD20 negative FL may have less benefit compared to patients with CD20-positive DLBCL and patients with CD20-positive FL, respectively. The potential risks and benefits associated with treatment of patients with CD20-negative DLBCL and FL with epcoritamab should be considered.

## Patient card

The doctor must inform the patient of the risk of CRS and ICANS and any signs and symptoms of CRS and ICANS. Patients must be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs and symptoms of CRS and/or ICANS. Patients should be provided with a patient card and instructed to carry the card at all times. This card describes symptoms of CRS and ICANS which, if experienced, should prompt the patient to seek immediate medical attention.

## Immunisation

Live and/or live-attenuated vaccines should not be given during epcoritamab therapy. Studies have not been conducted in patients who received live vaccines.

## Excipients with known effect

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

This medicinal product contains 21.9 mg of sorbitol per vial, which is equivalent to 27.33 mg/ml.

This medicinal product contains 0.42 mg of polysorbate 80 per vial, equivalent to 0.4 mg/ml. Polysorbate 80 may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

Transient elevation of certain proinflammatory cytokines by epcoritamab may suppress CYP450 enzyme activities. On initiation of epcoritamab therapy in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, therapeutic monitoring should be considered.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females

Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with epcoritamab and for at least 4 months after the last dose. Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating epcoritamab treatment.

## Pregnancy

Based on its mechanism of action, epcoritamab may cause foetal harm, including B-cell lymphocytopenia and alterations in normal immune responses, when administered to pregnant women. There are no data on the use of epcoritamab in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with epcoritamab. IgG1 antibodies, such as epcoritamab, can cross the placenta resulting in foetal exposure. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a foetus. Epcoritamab is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether epcoritamab is excreted in human milk or its effect on milk production. Since IgGs are known to be present in milk, neonatal exposure to epcoritamab may occur via lactational transfer. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with epcoritamab and for at least 4 months after the last dose.

## Fertility

No fertility studies have been conducted with epcoritamab (see section 5.3). The effect of epcoritamab on male and female fertility is unknown.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Epcoritamab has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Due to the potential for ICANS, patients receiving epcoritamab are at risk of altered level of consciousness (see section 4.4). Patients should be advised to exercise caution while (or avoid if symptomatic) driving, cycling or using heavy or potentially dangerous machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The safety of epcoritamab was evaluated in a non-randomised, single-arm GCT3013-01 study in 382 patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (N=167), follicular lymphoma (N=129) and follicular lymphoma (3-step step-up dose schedule N=86) after two or more lines of systemic therapy and included all the patients who enrolled to the 48 mg dose and received at least one dose of epcoritamab.

The following adverse reactions  have  been  reported  with  epcoritamab  during  clinical  studies  and  post marketing experience.

The median duration of exposure to epcoritamab was 4.9 months (range: &lt;1  to 30 months).

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were CRS injection site reactions, fatigue, viral infection, neutropenia, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, and diarrhoea.

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 50% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reaction (≥ 10%) was cytokine release syndrome (34%). Fourteen patients (3.7%) experienced a fatal adverse reaction (pneumonia in 9 (2.4%) patients, viral infection in 4 (1.0%) patients, and ICANS in 1 (0.3%) patient).

Adverse reactions that led to discontinuation occurred in 6.8% of patients. Discontinuation of epcoritamab due to pneumonia occurred in 14 (3.7%) patients, viral infection in 8 (2.1%) patients, fatigue in 2 (0.5%) patients, and CRS, ICANS, or diarrhoea, in 1 (0.3%) patient each.

Dose delays due to adverse reactions occurred in 42% of patients. Adverse reactions leading to dose delays (≥ 3%) were viral infections (17%), CRS (11%), neutropenia (5.2%), pneumonia (4.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (4.2%), and pyrexia (3.7%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions for epcoritamab from clinical studies (Table 7) are listed by MedDRA system organ class and are based on the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); and very rare (&lt; 1/10 000). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

In the event of overdose, monitor the patient for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and administer appropriate supportive treatment.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates, ATC code: L01FX27

## Mechanism of action

Epcoritamab is a humanised IgG1-bispecific antibody that binds to a specific extracellular epitope of CD20 on B cells and to CD3 on T cells. The activity of epcoritamab is dependent upon simultaneous engagement of CD20-expressing cancer cells and CD3-expressing endogenous T cells by epcoritamab that induces specific T-cell activation and T-cell-mediated killing of CD20-expressing cells.

Epcoritamab Fc region is silenced to prevent target-independent immune effector mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CDC), and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP).

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Epcoritamab induced rapid and sustained depletion of circulating B-cells (defined as CD19 B-cell counts ≤ 10 cell/µl) in the subjects who have detectable B cells at treatment initiation. There were 21% subjects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(n=33) with DLBCL and 50% subjects (n=56) with FL who had detectable circulating B-cells at treatment initiation. Transient reduction in circulating T cells was observed immediately after each dose in Cycle 1 and followed by T cell expansion in subsequent cycles.

In study GCT3013-01, following subcutaneous administration of epcoritamab at the recommended 2-step step-up dose schedule in patients with LBCL, transient and modest elevations of circulating levels of selected cytokines (IFN-γ, TNFα, IL-6, IL-2, and IL-10) occurred mostly after the first full dose (48 mg), with peak levels between 1 to 4 days post dose. Cytokine levels returned to baseline prior to the next full dose, however elevations of cytokines could also be observed after Cycle 1.

In study GCT3013-01, following subcutaneous administration of epcoritamab at the recommended 3-step step-up dose schedule in patients with FL, median IL-6 levels associated with CRS risk remained consistently low after each dose in Cycle 1 and beyond, particularly after the first full dose, compared to patients who received the 2-step step-up dose.

## Immunogenicity

Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were commonly detected. The incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs with the 2-step step-up dose schedule (0.16/0.8/48 mg) in the combined population of DLBCL and FL was 3.4% (3.4 % positive, 93.9% negative and 2.7% indeterminate, N=261 evaluable patients) and 3.3% (3.3% positive, 95% negative and 1.7% indeterminate, N= 60 evaluable patients), in studies GCT301301 and GCT3013-04, respectively.

The incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs with the 3-step step-up dose schedule (0.16/0.8/3/48 mg) in the FL optimisation cohort was 7% (7% positive, 91.5% negative and 1.4% indeterminate, N=71 evaluable patients) in study GCT3013-01. A subject is classified as indeterminate if the patient is confirmed ADA positive at baseline but there is no confirmed positive on-treatment record or if confirmed ADA positive on treatment record titre are equal or lower than baseline.

No evidence of ADA impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety was observed, however, data are still limited. Neutralising antibodies were not evaluated.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

Study GCT3013-01 was an open-label, multi-cohort, multicentre, single-arm study that evaluated epcoritamab as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The study includes a dose escalation part and an expansion part. The expansion part of the study included an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (aNHL) cohort, an indolent NHL (iNHL) cohort and a mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL) cohort. The pivotal aNHL cohort consisted of patients with LBCL (N=157), including patients with DLBCL (N=139, 12 patients of which had MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6 rearrangements i.e., DH/TH), with high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) (N=9), with follicular lymphoma grade 3B (FL) (N=5) and patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) (N=4). In the DLBCL cohort, 29% (40/139) of patients had transformed DLBCL arising from indolent lymphoma. Patients included in the study were required to have documented CD20+ mature B-cell neoplasm according to WHO classification 2016 or WHO classification 2008 based on representative pathology report, failed prior autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or were ineligible for autologous HSCT, patients who had lymphocyte counts &lt; 5×10 9 /L, and patients with at least 1 prior anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody-containing therapy.

The study excluded patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement of lymphoma, prior treatment with allogeneic HSCT or solid organ transplant, chronic ongoing infectious diseases, any patients with known impaired T-cell immunity, a creatinine clearance of less than 45 ml/min, alanine aminotransferase &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal, cardiac ejection fraction less than 45%, and known clinically significant cardiovascular disease. Efficacy was evaluated in 139 patients with DLBCL who had received at least one dose of epcoritamab SC in cycles of 4 weeks, i.e., 28 days. Epcoritamab monotherapy was administered at the recommended 2-step step-up dose schedule as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Cycle 1: epcoritamab 0.16 mg on Day 1, 0.8 mg on Day 8, 48 mg on Day 15 and Day 22
- Cycles 2-3: epcoritamab 48 mg on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22
- Cycles 4-9: epcoritamab 48 mg on Days 1 and 15
- Cycles 10 and beyond: epcoritamab 48 mg on Day 1

Patients continued to receive epcoritamab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table  8.

## Follicular lymphoma

Study GCT3013-01 was an open-label, multi-cohort, multicentre, single-arm trial that evaluated epcoritamab as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy. The study includes a dose escalation part, an expansion part and a 3-step step-up dose optimisation part. The expansion part of the study included an aggressive nonHodgkin lymphoma (aNHL) cohort, an indolent NHL (iNHL) cohort and a mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL) cohort. The pivotal iNHL cohort, included patients with FL. Patients included in the study were required to have documented CD20+ mature B-cell neoplasm according to WHO classification 2016 or WHO classification 2008 based on representative pathology report with histologic confirmed FL 1-3A at initial diagnosis without clinical or pathological evidence of transformation. All patients had relapsed or refractory disease to the last prior line therapy and previously treated with at least 2 lines of systemic antineoplastic therapy, including at least 1 anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody-containing therapy and an alkylating agent or lenalidomide. The study excluded patients with CNS involvement of lymphoma , allogeneic HSCT or solid organ transplant, ongoing active infectious diseases, any patients with known

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

impaired T-cell immunity, a creatinine clearance of less than 45 ml/min, alanine aminotransferase &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal and cardiac ejection fraction less than 45%. Efficacy was evaluated in 128 patients who had received epcoritamab subcutaneously (SC) in cycles of 4 weeks, i.e., 28 days. Epcoritamab was administered as a monotherapy in a 2-step step-up dose schedule as follows:

- Cycle 1: epcoritamab 0.16 mg on Day 1, 0.8 mg on Day 8, 48 mg on Day 15 and 48 mg on Day 22
- Cycles 2-3: epcoritamab 48 mg on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22
- Cycles 4-9: epcoritamab 48 mg on Days 1 and 15
- Cycles 10 and beyond: epcoritamab 48 mg on Day 1

Patients continued to receive epcoritamab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The median number of cycles initiated was 8 and 60% received 6 cycles.

The demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 10.

## Conditional approval

This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called 'conditional approval' scheme. This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The population pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous administration of epcoritamab was described by a two-compartment model with first order subcutaneous absorption and target-mediated drug elimination. The moderate to high pharmacokinetic variability for epcoritamab was observed and characterised by inter-individual variability (IIV) ranging from 25.7% to 137.5% coefficient of variation (CV) for epcoritamab PK parameters.

In patients with LBCL in study GCT3013-01, based on individually estimated exposures using population pharmacokinetic modelling, following the recommended 2-step step-up dose schedule SC dose of epcoritamab 48 mg, the geometric mean (% CV) Cmax of epcoritamab is 10.8 mcg/ml (41.7%) and AUC0-7d is 68.9 day*mcg/ml (45.1%) at the end of the weekly dosing schedule. The Ctrough at Week 12 is 8.4 (53.3%) mcg/ml. The geometric mean (% CV) Cmax of epcoritamab is 7.52 mcg/ml (41.1%) and AUC0-14d is 82.6 day*mcg/ml (49.3%) at the end of q2w schedule. The Ctrough for q2W schedule is 4.1 (73.9%) mcg/ml. The geometric mean (% CV) Cmax of epcoritamab is 4.76 mcg/ml (51.6%) and AUC0-28d is 74.3 day*mcg/ml (69.5%) at steady state during the q4w schedule. The Ctrough for q4W schedule is 1.2 (130%) mcg/ml.

Exposure parameters of epcoritamab in patients with FL were consistent with the exposure parameters seen in the patients with LBCL. Epcoritamab exposures are similar between FL subjects who received the 3-step step-up dose schedule and 2-step step-up dose schedule except for transiently lower trough concentrations, as expected, at Cycle 1 Day 15 after the second intermediate dose (3 mg) with 3-step step-up dose schedule compared first full 48 mg dose with 2-step step-up dose schedule.

## Absorption

The peak concentrations occurred around 3-4 days (Tmax) in patients with LBCL receiving the 48 mg full dose.

## Distribution

The geometric mean (% CV) central volume of distribution is 8.27 l (27.5%) and apparent steady-state volume of distribution is 25.6 l (81.8%) based on population PK modelling.

## Biotransformation

The metabolic pathway of epcoritamab has not been directly studied. Like other protein therapeutics, epcoritamab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways.

## Elimination

Epcoritamab is expected to undergo saturable target mediated clearance. The geometric mean (% CV) clearance (l/day) is 0.441 (27.8%). The half-life of epcoritamab is concentration dependent. The population PK model-derived geometric mean half-life of full dose epcoritamab (48 mg) ranged from 22 to 25 days based on frequency of dosing.

## Special populations

No clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab (Cycle 1 AUC within approximately 36%) were observed based on age (20 to 89 years), sex, or race/ethnicity (white, Asian, and other), mild to moderate renal impairment creatinine clearance (CLcr ≥ 30 ml/min to CLcr &lt; 90 ml/min), and mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST &gt; ULN, or total bilirubin 1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) after accounting for differences in bodyweight. No patients with severe to end-stage renal disease (CLcr &lt; 30 ml/min) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt; 3 times ULN and any AST) have been studied. There is very limited data in moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST, N=1). Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab is unknown in these populations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Like other therapeutic proteins, body weight (39 to 172 kg) has a statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab. Based on exposure-response analysis and clinical data, considering the exposures in patients at either low body weight (e.g., 46 kg) or high body weight (e.g., 105 kg) and across body weight categories (&lt; 65 kg, 65-&lt; 85, ≥ 85), the effect on exposures is not clinically relevant.

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab in paediatric patients has not been established.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Animal pharmacology and/or toxicology

No reproductive or developmental toxicity studies in animals have been conducted with epcoritamab. Effects generally consistent with the pharmacologic mechanism of action of epcoritamab were observed in cynomolgus monkeys. These findings included dose-related adverse clinical signs (including vomiting, decreased activity, and mortality at high doses) and cytokine release, reversible hematologic alterations, reversible B-cell depletion in peripheral blood, and reversible decreased lymphoid cellularity in secondary lymphoid tissues.

## Mutagenicity

Mutagenicity studies have not been conducted with epcoritamab.

## Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with epcoritamab.

## Impairment of fertility

Animal fertility studies have not been conducted with epcoritamab, however, epcoritamab did not cause toxicological changes in the reproductive organs of male or female cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 1 mg/kg/week in intravenous general toxicity study of 5-week duration. The AUC exposures (timeaveraged over 7 days) at the high dose in cynomolgus monkeys were similar to those in patients (AUC07d) receiving the recommended dose.

## 1. What Tepkinly is and what it is used for

## What Tepkinly is

Tepkinly is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance epcoritamab. Tepkinly is used on its own (monotherapy) to treat adult patients who have a blood cancer called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma (FL) when the disease has come back or did not respond to previous treatment after at least two prior therapies.

## How Tepkinly works

Epcoritamab is specifically designed to help your own immune system to attack cancer (lymphoma) cells. Epcoritamab acts by attaching to your body's immune cells and cancer cells, bringing them together, so that your immune system can destroy the cancer cells.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Tepkinly

## Do not use Tepkinly

If you are allergic to epcoritamab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Tepkinly.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Tepkinly if you

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- have current or past problems with your nervous system - such as seizures
- have an infection
- are due to have a vaccine or you know you may need to have one in the near future.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Tepkinly.

Tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of any of the side effects listed below, during or after treatment with Tepkinly. You may need additional medical treatment.

- Cytokine release syndrome a life-threatening condition causing fever, vomiting, difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, chills, rapid heartbeat, headache and dizziness or lightheadedness associated with medicines that stimulate T cells.
- Before each injection under the skin, you may be given medicines which help reduce possible effects of cytokine release syndrome.
- Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) -a rare condition in which the immune system makes too many of otherwise normal infection fighting cells called histiocytes and lymphocytes. It can lead to enlarged liver and/or spleen, heart problems and kidney abnormalities. Symptoms may include fever, skin rash, swollen lymph glands, breathing problems and easy bruising. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms at the same time.
- ICANS (immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome)
- Symptoms may include problems with use of language (including speech, understanding, writing and reading), drowsiness, confusion/disorientation, muscle weakness, seizures, swelling of a part of the brain, and memory loss.
- Infections - you may get signs of infection, such as fever of 38 °C or above, chills, cough, or pain with urination which can vary depending on where in the body the infection is .
- Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) - Symptoms of this serious and potentially fatal brain condition may include blurred vision, loss of vision or double vision, difficulty speaking, weakness or clumsiness of an arm or a leg, a change in the way you walk or problems with your balance, personality changes, changes in thinking, memory and orientation leading to confusion. These symptoms may start several months after treatment has ended and they usually develop slowly and gradually over weeks or months. It is important that your relatives or caregivers are also aware of these symptoms, since they may notice symptoms that you are not aware of.
- Tumour lysis syndrome some people may get unusual levels of some salts in the blood caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells during treatment. This is called tumour lysis syndrome (TLS).
- Your doctor or nurse will do blood tests to check for this condition. Before each injection under the skin, you should be well-hydrated and may be given other medicines that can help reduce high levels of uric acid and help reduce possible effects of tumour lysis syndrome.
- Tumour flare as your cancer is destroyed, it may react and appear to get worse -this is called 'tumour flare reaction'.

## Children and adolescents

Tepkinly is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years, as there is no information about use in this age group.

## Other medicines and Tepkinly

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or using, have recently taken or used, or might take or use any other medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines.

## Pregnancy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Do not use Tepkinly during pregnancy, as it may affect your unborn baby. Your doctor may ask you to take a pregnancy test before starting treatment.

## Contraception

If you are a woman who is able to have children, you must use effective contraception to avoid becoming pregnant while taking Tepkinly and for at least 4 months after your last dose of Tepkinly. If you become pregnant during this time, you must talk to your doctor straight away.

Talk to your doctor or nurse about suitable methods of contraception.

## Breast-feeding

You must not breast-feed during treatment with Tepkinly and for at least 4 months after the last dose. It is not known whether Tepkinly passes into breast milk and whether it could affect your baby.

## Fertility

The effect of Tepkinly on male and female fertility is unknown.

## Driving and using machines

Due to the possible symptoms of ICANS, you should be careful while driving, cycling or using heavy or potentially dangerous machines. If you currently have such symptoms, avoid these activities and contact your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. See section 4 for more information about side effects.

## Tepkinly contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Tepkinly contains sorbitol

This medicine contains 21.9 mg sorbitol in each vial, which is equivalent to 27.33 mg/ml.

## Tepkinly contains polysorbate

This medicine contains 0.42 mg of polysorbate 80 in each vial, equivalent to 0.4 mg/ml. Polysorbate 80 may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## 3. How Tepkinly will be given

A doctor experienced in treating cancer will take care of your treatment. Follow the treatment schedule explained to you by your doctor.

Tepkinly will be given to you by a doctor or nurse as an injection under your skin. Tepkinly will be given to you in cycles of 28 days, on a dosing schedule given to you by your doctor.

## You will be given Tepkinly according to the following schedule

| Cycle                | Dosing schedule   |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Cycles 1 to 3        | Weekly            |
| Cycles 4 to 9        | Every two weeks   |
| Cycles 10 and beyond | Every four weeks  |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

You may be given other medicines before you are given Tepkinly. This is to help prevent reactions such as cytokine release syndrome and fever in Cycle 1 (and potentially future cycles).

These medicines may include

- Corticosteroids - such as dexamethasone, prednisolone or equivalent
- An antihistamine - such as diphenhydramine
- Paracetamol

During the first month (Cycle 1) when you are given Tepkinly:

- It is important that you are well hydrated. For that reason your doctor may tell you to drink plenty of water the day before and the day after you are given Tepkinly. On the day you receive Tepkinly, your doctor may give you fluids through a needle placed in your vein (intravenously).
- If you take medicine for high blood pressure, your doctor may ask you to stop taking it for a short time while you are on Tepkinly.

## If you have diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)

The first full dose (48 mg) of Tepkinly will be given to you on Cycle 1 Day 15. Your doctor will monitor how your treatment is working and ask you to stay in a hospital for 24 hours after the first full dose (48 mg) because this is when reactions such as CRS, ICANS and fever are most likely to happen.

## If you have follicular lymphoma (FL)

The first full dose (48 mg) of Tepkinly will be given to you on Cycle 1 Day 22.

You will be given Tepkinly for as long as your doctor thinks you are benefitting from the treatment.

Your doctor may delay or completely stop your treatment with Tepkinly if you have certain side effects.

## If you forget to use Tepkinly

If you forget or miss your medical appointment, make another one straight away. For the treatment to be fully effective, it is very important not to miss a dose.

## If you stop using Tepkinly

Do not stop treatment with Tepkinly unless you have discussed this with your doctor. This is because stopping treatment may make your condition worse.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## 1. What Tepkinly is and what it is used for

## What Tepkinly is

Tepkinly is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance epcoritamab. Tepkinly is used on its own (monotherapy) to treat adult patients who have a blood cancer called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma (FL) when the disease has come back or did not respond to previous treatment after at least two prior therapies.

## How Tepkinly works

Epcoritamab is specifically designed to help your own immune system to attack cancer (lymphoma) cells. Epcoritamab acts by attaching to your body's immune cells and cancer cells, bringing them together, so that your immune system can destroy the cancer cells.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Tepkinly

## Do not use Tepkinly

If you are allergic to epcoritamab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Tepkinly.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Tepkinly if you

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- have current or past problems with your nervous system - such as seizures
- have an infection
- are due to have a vaccine or you know you may need to have one in the near future.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Tepkinly.

Tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of any of the side effects listed below, during or after treatment with Tepkinly. You may need additional medical treatment.

- Cytokine release syndrome a life-threatening condition causing fever, vomiting, difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, chills, rapid heartbeat, headache and dizziness or lightheadedness associated with medicines that stimulate T cells.
- Before each injection under the skin, you may be given medicines which help reduce possible effects of cytokine release syndrome.
- Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) -a rare condition in which the immune system makes too many of otherwise normal infection fighting cells called histiocytes and lymphocytes. It can lead to enlarged liver and/or spleen, heart problems and kidney abnormalities. Symptoms may include fever, skin rash, swollen lymph glands, breathing problems and easy bruising. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms at the same time.
- ICANS (immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome)
- Symptoms may include problems with use of language (including speech, understanding, writing and reading), drowsiness, confusion/disorientation, muscle weakness, seizures, swelling of a part of the brain, and memory loss.
- Infections - you may get signs of infection, such as fever of 38 °C or above, chills, cough, or pain with urination which can vary depending on where in the body the infection is.
- Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) - Symptoms of this serious and potentially fatal brain condition may include blurred vision, loss of vision or double vision, difficulty speaking, weakness or clumsiness of an arm or a leg, a change in the way you walk or problems with your balance, personality changes, changes in thinking, memory and orientation leading to confusion. These symptoms may start several months after treatment has ended and they usually develop slowly and gradually over weeks or months. It is important that your relatives or caregivers are also aware of these symptoms, since they may notice symptoms that you are not aware of.
- Tumour lysis syndrome some people may get unusual levels of some salts in the blood caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells during treatment. This is called tumour lysis syndrome (TLS).
- Your doctor or nurse will do blood tests to check for this condition. Before each injection under the skin, you should be well-hydrated and may be given other medicines that can help reduce high levels of uric acid and help reduce possible effects of tumour lysis syndrome.
- Tumour flare as your cancer is destroyed, it may react and appear to get worse -this is called 'tumour flare reaction'.

## Children and adolescents

Tepkinly is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years, as there is no information about use in this age group.

## Other medicines and Tepkinly

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or using, have recently taken or used, or might take or use any other medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines.

## Pregnancy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Do not use Tepkinly during pregnancy, as it may affect your unborn baby. Your doctor may ask you to take a pregnancy test before starting treatment.

## Contraception

If you are a woman who is able to have children, you must use effective contraception to avoid becoming pregnant while taking Tepkinly and for at least 4 months after your last dose of Tepkinly. If you become pregnant during this time, you must talk to your doctor straight away.

Talk to your doctor or nurse about suitable methods of contraception.

## Breast-feeding

You must not breast-feed during treatment with Tepkinly and for at least 4 months after the last dose. It is not known whether Tepkinly passes into breast milk and whether it could affect your baby.

## Fertility

The effect of Tepkinly on male and female fertility is unknown.

## Driving and using machines

Due to the possible symptoms of ICANS, you should be careful while driving, cycling or using heavy or potentially dangerous machines. If you currently have such symptoms, avoid these activities and contact your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. See section 4 for more information about side effects.

## Tepkinly contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Tepkinly contains sorbitol

This medicine contains 21.9 mg sorbitol in each vial, which is equivalent to 27.33 mg/ml.

## Tepkinly contains polysorbate

This medicine contains 0.42 mg of polysorbate 80 in each vial, equivalent to 0.4 mg/ml. Polysorbate 80 may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## 3. How Tepkinly will be given

A doctor experienced in treating cancer will take care of your treatment. Follow the treatment schedule explained to you by your doctor.

Tepkinly will be given to you by a doctor or nurse as an injection under your skin. Tepkinly will be given to you in cycles of 28 days, on a dosing schedule given to you by your doctor.

## You will be given Tepkinly according to the following schedule

| Cycle                | Dosing schedule   |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Cycles 1 to 3        | Weekly            |
| Cycles 4 to 9        | Every two weeks   |
| Cycles 10 and beyond | Every four weeks  |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

You may be given other medicines before you are given Tepkinly. This is to help prevent reactions such as cytokine release syndrome and fever in Cycle 1 (and potentially future cycles).

These medicines may include

- Corticosteroids - such as dexamethasone, prednisolone or equivalent
- An antihistamine - such as diphenhydramine
- Paracetamol

During the first month (Cycle 1) when you are given Tepkinly:

- It is important that you are well hydrated. For that reason, your doctor may tell you to drink plenty of water the day before and the day after you are given Tepkinly. On the day you receive Tepkinly, your doctor may give you fluids through a needle placed in your vein (intravenously).
- If you take medicine for high blood pressure, your doctor may ask you to stop taking it for a short time while you are on Tepkinly.

## If you have diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)

The first full dose (48 mg) of Tepkinly will be given to you on Cycle 1 Day 15. Your doctor will monitor how your treatment is working and ask you to stay in a hospital for 24 hours after the first full dose (48 mg) because this is when reactions such as CRS, ICANS and fever are most likely to happen.

## If you have follicular lymphoma (FL)

The first full dose (48 mg) of Tepkinly will be given to you on Cycle 1 Day 22.

You will be given Tepkinly for as long as your doctor thinks you are benefitting from the treatment.

Your doctor may delay or completely stop your treatment with Tepkinly if you have certain side effects.

## If you forget to use Tepkinly

If you forget or miss your medical appointment, make another one straight away. For the treatment to be fully effective, it is very important not to miss a dose.

## If you stop using Tepkinly

Do not stop treatment with Tepkinly unless you have discussed this with your doctor. This is because stopping treatment may make your condition worse.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## 4. Possible side effects
