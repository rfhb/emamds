## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This module reflects the initial scientific discussion and scientific discussion on procedures, which have been finalised before 1 September 2004. For scientific information on procedures after this date please refer to module 8B

## 1. Introduction

Parkinson's  disease  (PD)  is  a  neurodegenerative  disorder  characterised  by  bradykinesia,  rigidity, postural imbalance and tremor. The incidence of PD is estimated to 4.5-16/100,000 persons per year and on average, 2 to 3 % of the population in the western world will develop PD. The disease is rare before  the  age  of  50  years,  and  incidence  rates  increase  with  age.  The  cause  of  the  disease  is  still unknown. PD develops due to loss of neuronal functions within the basal ganglia and the substantia nigra of the brain. Specifically, there is a marked deficiency in the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) system due to degeneration of nigral DA neurons. Thus, restoration of the dopaminergic transmission forms the central strategy for the treatment of PD.

The standard treatment of PD consists of levodopa (L-dopa, a dopamine precursor) in combination with  a  peripheral  aromatic  amino-acid  decarboxylase  (AADC)  inhibitor  (carbidopa  or  benserazide). Other treatments include DA agonists and anticholinergic drugs. Such compounds are often given in combination with L-dopa to reduce the dose of the latter thereby increasing treatment tolerance. The response  to  L-dopa  is  generally  stable  during  the  initial  years  of  treatment.  However,  due  to  the progressive degeneration of the DA system, the neuronal buffer capacity is believed to be reduced. At that  stage, the patient  may switch within seconds from a state of relatively good mobility to one of severe parkinsonism, giving rise to the term 'ON-OFF' phenomenon. This end-of-dose deterioration implies a shortening of the duration of action of L-dopa. OFF periods tend to become longer and to set in abruptly. ON periods are often combined with dyskinesias and/or other movement disorders.

To improve the brain bioavailability of L-dopa, its metabolism via decarboxylation is prevented by the co-administration  of  peripherally  active  AADC  inhibitors.  When  peripheral  dopa-decarboxylase  is inhibited, the main catabolic pathway of L-dopa is the conversion into 3-OMD (3-methoxy-dopa) by the  enzyme catecholO -methyl transferase (COMT). Thus, concomitant inhibition of COMT should reduce the metabolism of L-dopa and increase the amount of L-dopa available for conversion into DA in the brain.

Tolcapone is an orally active, selective and reversible COMT inhibitor. By inhibition of COMT, the breakdown of L-dopa is decreased and thus, the half life of L-dopa is prolonged. Tasmar is indicated in combination with levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa for use in patients with Parkinson's disease, who cannot be stabilised on levodopa therapy, especially fluctuating patients with end-of-dose phenomena. The recommended starting dose is 100 mg orally t.i.d. The dose can be increased to 200 mg t.i.d.

## 2. Overview of Part II of the dossier: chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Tolcapone  is  an  orally  active  benzophenone  derivative  COMT  inhibitor,  indicated  for  use  as  an adjunct in the treatment of PD. It is presented as Tasmar tablets 100 and 200 mg. Different pack sizes are proposed: 30 and 60 tablets in blisters, or 100 tablets in glass bottles.

## Composition

The film-coated tablets are made with standard core and film-coat excipients; the core formulations are  dose  proportional.  The  active  substance  comprises  57%  of  the  core  weight.  The  containers proposed are PVC/PE/PVDC blister packs and amber glass bottles.

Satisfactory detail has been provided on the development of the marketing formulation. Particle size is controlled because of the low solubility of tolcapone in water and in acidic solution. All batches have met  the  acceptable  specification  limits.  For  the in vitro dissolution  testing,  an  alkaline  medium  of borate buffer pH 8.5 was finally chosen to allow complete dissolution within a reasonable time.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Method of preparation

Tablet  core  batch  sizes  of  410  kg  are  proposed,  equivalent  to  2  million  of  the  100  mg  tablets  or 1 million of the 200 mg tablets.

The manufacturing process involves granulation, mixing with extra-granular excipients, compression and  film-coating.  The  in-process  controls  and  limits  proposed  are  satisfactory.  The  manufacturing process has been adequately validated on both pilot-scale and production-scale batches.

## Control of starting materials

The drug substances specification includes tests for identity by IR, UV and HPLC, related substances, assay, particle size, residual solvents, water, sulphate ash and heavy metals. Only two impurities are named in the specification, Ro 40-7591 (the precursor of tolcapone) and Ro 44-1446 (a by-product); the limits proposed are acceptable. In the related-substances HPLC tests, three impurities (Ro 44-1446, Ro 48-6830 and Ro 61-4977) co-elute at the same retention time. However, as very low amounts of the three impurities have been found, the designation of them as Ro 44-1446, is acceptable.

Satisfactory limits are proposed for the solvents tested (methylene chloride and ethanol) and for other tests in the specification.

Tolcapone  is  synthesised  in  a  3-step  process.  Pre-clinical  and  clinical  studies  were  performed  with tolcapone  made  by  a  6-step  process.  However,  with  regard  to  related  substances,  no  significant differences  were  shown  between  batches  synthesised  from  the  two  processes.  Batch  analytical  data confirm their equivalent quality.

The  structure  of  tolcapone  has  been  proved  by  elementary  analysis  and  interpreted  UV,  IR,  MS, 1 H-  and 13 C-NMR spectra.  Two  polymorphic  forms  have  been  found,  modification  A  and  B.  The control of polymorphic form by IR is considered to be sufficient and no quality or efficacy issues arise from the existence of the two polymorphs. The analytical methods have been well validated.

All  potential  impurities  arising  from  synthesis  and  all  organic  solvents  used  during  synthesis  have been tested for, but only those related substances named in the specification have been detected.

The excipients comply with Ph. Eur., B.P. or U.S.P. requirements. The colourants comply with the EEC requirements.

Standard packaging materials are used, and testing is satisfactory.

## Control tests on the finished product

The specification includes standard tests for this type of dosage form. The dissolution specification limit is 70% (Q) in 30 minutes, which means that the dissolution result of individual tablets is equal or higher than 75%. The degradation product limits are less than the proposed ICH threshold limits for identification.  The  HPLC  method  used  for  determination  of  content  of  tolcapone  and  degradation products is adequately validated. Batch analytical results provided for five batches of each strength, including one production batch, comply with the specifications.

## Stability

Four batches have been stored for up to one year at different temperatures and relative humidity. No degradation was detected using the validated routine methods. Further stability data showed that the particle size distribution does not change on storage. The results support the proposed two-year retest date.  Stress  testing  has  shown  tolcapone  to  be  degraded  in  alkaline  solutions,  with  a  very  slight degradation in hydrogen peroxide conditions. No degradation occurs under other stress conditions.

Three tablet batches of each strength have been stored in both amber glass bottles and blister packs for up  to  18  months  at  different  temperatures  and  relative  humidity;  both  pilot  and  production  scale batches were included. The results showed good stability, with no evidence of degradation using the routine  stability-indicating  HPLC  method.  The  results  also  demonstrated  the  suitability  of  the proposed packaging materials. Stress testing under light, humidity and in-use conditions confirmed the good stability of the product. Based on these data, a 2 year shelf life was supported when the product was  centrally  authorised.  The  shelf  life  was  then  extended  to  3  years,  in  accordance  to  the  data

presented after the Marketing Authorisation by the MAH to the EMEA and to the subsequent positive notification issued on 28 October 1997.

## 3. Overview of Part III of the dossier: toxico-pharmacological aspects

## Pharmacodynamics

## Effects related to proposed indications

In  vitro,  tolcapone  showed  a  high  affinity  for  COMT  with  onset  of  action  within  10  minutes  and duration of inhibition of up to 8 hours. In ex vivo rat preparations, the doses required to reduce COMT activity to 50% of baseline values ranged from 1.2 mg/kg to 28 mg/kg depending on the organ system studied. After oral administration in rats, a dose dependent inhibition of COMT activity was observed both in peripheral organs and the CNS. Maximal inhibition was reached within 15-60 minutes after dosing, and complete recovery was observed after 8 to 16 hours. In vivo microdialysis studies in rats indicated that tolcapone when given in combination with L-dopa and benserazide, increased L-dopa levels in the CNS. Tolcapone did not inhibit any other enzymes or show affinity to neurotransmitter binding sites. Data from studies in animal models of PD, supported a potential efficacy in humans PD when tolcapone was co-administered with L-dopa. Taken together, the data indicate that tolcapone is a potent,  selective  and  reversible  inhibitor  of  COMT.  This  may  lead  to  an  enhancement  of  the bioavailability of L-dopa in the brain, as evidenced by changes in the flux of its metabolites.

## General pharmacodynamics

An antidepressant  effect  of  tolcapone  was  demonstrated  in  a  rat  model  of  depression,  probably  by enhancing  brain  levels  of  catecholamines.  Tolcapone  did  not  induce  physical  or  psychological dependence. No adverse effects of clinical relevance were observed with respect to the respiratory, renal, or gastrointestinal systems.

Following  intravenous  administration  in  anaestethised  dogs,  a  dose  dependent  decrease  of  blood pressure was observed. In rabbits, an intravenous bolus of a high dose caused cardiac arrhythmias and death while no cardiac effects were observed following intravenous infusion. The systemic exposure (Cmax)  was  9-17  fold  (dogs)  and  20-40  fold  (rabbits)  higher  than  that  of  humans  given  clinical therapy. Based on these safety margins and the fact that tolcapone is intended for oral use only, the clinical relevance of these findings was regarded as minor.

## Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetics  of  tolcapone  have  been  investigated  in  the  rat,  dog  and  rabbit.  Modest quantitative differences across species were found. However, the pharmacokinetic profile of tolcapone is sufficiently similar in animals and humans to allow the animal toxicology studies to be considered as a valid exploratory tool for human safety.

Absorption  after  oral  administration  is  rapid  with  peak  plasma  concentrations  occurring  within 30 minutes post dose. In rat, dog and human, the oral bioavailability was 60-80%. The protein binding of tolcapone was  similarly high, around  99.9%,  in rat, dog  and  human.  Consequently,  the extravascular  tissue  distribution  was  limited.  The  overall  elimination  half-life  of  tolcapone  ranged from  30  minutes  to  2  hours,  depending  on  species  and  route  of  administration.  Following  repeated administration in rats, no accumulation or retention of drug-related material was observed.

Tolcapone  is  extensively  metabolised  in  all  species  including  human,  the  main  metabolic  pathway being glucuronidation to the 3-O-methylglucuronide. In addition, oxidation to the alcohol derivative and  methylation  are  significant  routes.  In  rat  and  dog,  tolcapone  metabolites  are  predominantly excreted in bile, while in humans, urinary excretion was predominant. Tolcapone is excreted in high concentration in rat milk.

## Toxicology

Single dose toxicity studies were performed in rodents and a pyramidal dose toxicity study in dogs. Sudden deaths occurred in rats after oral tolcapone doses ≥ 300  mg/kg or plasma concentrations of &gt; 100 µ g/ml (Cmax in patients is about 6 µ g/ml). No mortality occurred in dogs up to the top dose of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

300  mg/kg.  In  rodents,  single  dose  toxicity  was  similar  when  tolcapone  was  given  alone  or  in combination with L-dopa (1000 mg/kg) and decarboxylase inhibitor (carbidopa or benserazide).

Repeat dose toxicity of tolcapone was studied for up to 12 months in rats dosed via feed-admix with up  to  500  mg/kg/d  (6  month)  or  450  mg/kg/d  (12  month)  and  in  dogs  given  capsules  with  up  to 2x90  mg/kg/d  (12  month).  In  rats,  the  kidney  was  the  target  organ  of  toxicity.  Degeneration  of proximal tubular epithelium with atypical nuclei was observed in the 12 month study at plasma AUC (based on unbound concentrations) about 10 times greater than those in patients. The same type of lesion, with single cell necrosis and regenerative hyperplasia was seen in the 2 year carcinogenicity study (see further below). At the no adverse effect levels (NOAEL) for these findings, the systemic exposure  of  rats  was  equivalent  to  at  least  two  times  the  therapeutic  AUC.  In  dogs,  vomiting  and occasional phases of soft stool were the most prominent signs and occurred at the top dose.

The  combination  of  tolcapone,  L-dopa  and  decarboxylase  inhibitor  (carbidopa  or  benserazide)  was studied for up to 13 weeks in rats and dogs. In addition, the effects of the carbidopa combination were studied in monkeys during 4 weeks. Not unexpectedly, these studies showed a slight enhancement of some  L-dopa  related  effects,  e.g.  hyperactivity  in  rats  and  monkeys,  increased  salivation  in  dogs. However, overall,  it  was  concluded  that  no  interactions  resulting  in  new  unexpected  findings  were revealed.

Reproductive toxicity -No effects on fertility and general reproductive performance of doses up to 300 mg/kg/d of tolcapone were observed in the rat. Segment II studies were performed in rats (doses up to 300 mg/kg/d) and rabbits (doses up to 400 mg/kg/d). In the rat study, some fetal abnormalities and variations were observed in the tolcapone groups, but the findings were isolated and the relation to treatment was considered questionable. In the rabbit study, an abortive potential was observed at doses ≥ 100 mg/kg/d. Peri/post-natal performance was evaluated in rats with doses up to 250/150 mg/kg/d (the high dose was reduced due to high maternal mortality). In the high dose group, resorptions and litter size were slightly affected, as well as learning performance of female pups. The NOAEL  correspondent  to  exposures  at  least  3  times  higher  than  estimated  therapeutic  exposure. Segment  II  studies  of  the  combination  of  tolcapone,  L-dopa/carbidopa  were  performed  in  rats  and rabbits.  A  non-significant  increase  of  fetotoxicity  and  some  skeletal  defects  were  observed  with L-dopa/carbidopa  alone  and  in  combination  with  tolcapone.  Possibly,  these  effects  were  related  to L-dopa which is known to induce skeletal defects in rabbits. The findings in the reproductive studies are addressed in section 4.6 of the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Genotoxicity -The genotoxicity potential of tolcapone alone and in combination with L-dopa/carbidopa  was  studied  in  an  adequate  battery  of  genotoxicity  tests,  performed  according  to current  requirements.  Based  on  these  studies,  it  was  concluded  that  tolcapone  did  not  exert  any clinically relevant genotoxic effects.

Carcinogenicity -Carcinogenicity studies were performed in rodents administered up to 800 mg/kg/d (mice) or 450 mg/kg/d (rats) tolcapone in the diet. The mouse study was terminated after 80 (females) or 95 (males) weeks at a mortality rate of about 50%. There were no treatment-related increases of neoplastic findings. The duration of the rat study was 104 weeks as planned. Three and five percent of the rats in the mid- and high-dose groups, respectively, were shown to have renal epithelial tumours (adenomas or carcinomas). The tumours were considered to be due to cell necrosis and consequent repair due to chronic epithelial cell damage in the proximal tubule. No evidence of renal toxicity was observed  in  the  low-dose  group,  equivalent  to  at  least  two  times  the  therapeutic  AUC.  Based  on comparisons  of  plasma  levels,  a  safety  factor  of  2-5  (or  4-10  based  on  unbound  tolcapone concentrations) was established. These data were incorporated in the SPC at the time of first approval.

Uterine carcinomas were present in 0/100 control rats, 2/49 low dose, 3/50 intermediate,  7/50 high dose  animals.  The  uterine  carcinomas  were  considered  to  be  secondary  to  a  tolcapone-induced imbalance in the dopamine-prolactin-oestrogen-progestagen axis, and to be species specific to the rat.

Environmental risk assessment -  Although tolcapone is classified as harmful for the environment, the  solubility  of  the  compound  would  be  sufficient  to  result  in  a  rapid  and  high  degree  dilution yielding concentrations below levels that would cause adverse effects.

In  summary,  the  pre-clinical  documentation  of  tolcapone  is  of  good  quality.  Tolcapone  has  been demonstrated to be a selective, potent and reversible inhibitor of COMT which enhances brain levels

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of  L-dopa  when  co-administered  with  L-dopa  and  a  peripheral  decarboxylase  inhibitor.  Based  on findings in long-term toxicity studies, the main preclinical concern with respect to human safety is the nephrotoxic  potential  of  tolcapone. This  together  with  findings  in  reproductive  toxicity  studies  has been addressed in the relevant sections of the SPC.

## 4. Overview of Part IV of the dossier: clinical aspects

In addition to the studies related to pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics, the core clinical documentation of tolcapone consists of 6 trials (5 placebo controlled and 1 open-label) conducted in fluctuating PD patients and 2 trials (placebo-controlled) in non-fluctuating patients.

## Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamic effect of tolcapone was studied in 13 phase I trials. Inhibition of erythrocyte COMT  activity  was  monitored  as  a  measure  of  tolcapone  effect.  There  was  a  close,  inverse, relationship  between  rising  plasma  tolcapone  levels  and  falling  erythrocyte  COMT  activity.  After withdrawal, a moderate 'rebound' effect with erythrocyte COMT activity rising above baseline was observed. A dose response study in healthy volunteers, indicated a steep increase in maximum COMT inhibition for doses up to 50 mg, a slower rise between 50 and 200 mg, and a plateau thereafter.

When  tolcapone  was  co-administered  with  L-dopa  +  decarboxylase  inhibitor,  the  plasma  levels  of L-dopa were dose-dependently increased up to a tolcapone dose of 200 mg. Following this tolcapone dose  (200  mg  t.i.d),  together  with  L-dopa  plus  carbidopa  or  benserazide  (100  mg  +  25  mg),  t 1/2 of L-dopa was prolonged  1.1-1.9  times  that  of  placebo,  and  the  L-dopa  AUC  was  doubled.  The  peak plasma  concentration  remained  unchanged.  Higher  tolcapone  doses  did  not  improve  the  L-dopa pharmacokinetics.  The  doses  selected  for  phase  II  trials  were  based  on  the  effects  of  tolcapone  on L-dopa pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic documentation consists of 15 clinical trials in  healthy volunteers, PD patients and patients with hepatic disease. The pharmacokinetics of tolcapone and its main metabolite RO 407591 were studied after administration of tolcapone alone or in combination with L-dopa/carbidopa and  L-dopa/benserazide.  Furthermore,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  L-dopa  and  its  metabolites  were investigated  when  L-dopa  was  co-administered  with  tolcapone.  Both  compartmental  and  noncompartmental  pharmacokinetic  methods  were  used  and  based  on  data  from  phase  III  trials, 2 population pharmacokinetic analyses were submitted.

The  absolute  bioavailability  after  oral  administration  was  65%.  In  the  presence  of  food,  the bioavailability was reduced but it was concluded that because adjustment of the dose of both tolcapone and L-dopa will be necessary to achieve optimal therapeutic effect, tolcapone  may be administered with or without concomitant food intake. After a single oral dose of tolcapone alone or together with L-dopa  +  decarboxylase  inhibitor,  tmax  was  1.4-1.8  h.  The  plasma  protein  binding  was  high,  the unbound fraction in healthy volunteers was 0.12 + 0.01%. The volume of distribution at steady state was  small  (9  l).  At  recommended  therapeutic  doses,  no  accumulation  of  tolcapone  was  observed following repeated administration.

Tolcapone  is  almost  completely  metabolised  prior  to  excretion,  with  less  than  1%  of  the  parent compound excreted unchanged. Following administration of a radiolabelled dose, 60% of radioactivity was recovered  in  urine  and  40%  in  faeces.  In  plasma,  most  radioactivity  up  to  12  hours  post  dose corresponded  to  tolcapone  and  its  main  metabolite  the  glucuronide.  The  total  clearance  was 7-8 l/h,  of  which  renal  clearance  was  0.02  l/h.  The  estimated  terminal  half  life  was  1-4  hours.  The population analyses based on data from phase III trials, indicated a slightly lower clearance (4.5-5.5 l/h) and bigger volume of distribution (15-35 l) and thus, a slightly longer half life in PD patients.

The main metabolic pathway of tolcapone is conjugation via glucuronyl transferase. Tolcapone is also methylated by COMT to 3-O-methyl-tolcapone which has a half-life of 55 h after oral administration. Metabolism via CYP 3A4 and CYP 2A6 to a primary alcohol which is subsequently oxidised by an unknown enzyme to the carboxylic acid has also been demonstrated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  pharmacokinetics  of  tolcapone  were  studied  in  subjects  with  non-cirrhotic  or  cirrhotic  liver disease. It was shown that liver disease resulted in a 50% reduction of the clearance of unbound drug. Thus,  increased  plasma  levels  of  unbound  drug  can  be  expected.  This  was  addressed  in  the  SPC, which recommended that patients with moderate liver impairment should not be escalated to 200 mg t.i.d.

A special study in patients with renal impairment has not been performed. Data from clinical trials indicated  that  the  tolcapone  does  not  accumulate  in  Parkinson's  disease  patients  with  creatinine clearances varying from 30-130 ml/min.

In in  vivo interaction studies,  tolcapone did not affect  the  pharmacokinetics  of  desipramine (glucuronidation  as  main  metabolic  pathway),  tolbutamide,  (CYP  2C9)  or  carbidopa  (COMT).  A number of catecholamines are metabolised via COMT and potentially, COMT inhibition could affect their  elimination.  However,  no  significant  pharmacodynamic  or  pharmacokinetic  interactions  were seen  when  ephedrine  was  given  together  with  tolcapone  +  L-dopa/carbidopa.  Interaction  with benserazide was observed, which may lead to increased levels of benserazide and its active metabolite. This is referred to in the SPC.

A number of  tablet  formulations  have  been  used  in  clinical  trials.  Bioequivalence  has  been  shown between the different formulations.

## Efficacy at the time of granting of the EU Marketing Authorisation

As Parkinson's disease progresses control of symptoms, particularly mobility, with L-dopa becomes increasingly  difficult,  due  to  the  ON/OFF  phenomenon.  Patients  experiencing  ON/OFF  effects  are referred to as fluctuating patients, those with stable a response to L-dopa treatment as non-fluctuating patients.

For 'fluctuating' patients, the primary efficacy criterion was ON/OFF time assessed by patient diary rating. For non-fluctuating patients, the primary criterion was the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale  (UPDRS),  and  the  Assessment  of  Daily  Living  (ADL)  scale.  Secondary  criteria  were;  for fluctuating  patients  ADL,  and  for  both  fluctuators  and  non-fluctuators  global  investigators  scales, UPDRS motor scale and reduction of the L-dopa dose.

In fluctuating PD patients, 2 Phase II and 3 Phase III placebo controlled trials were performed. Two of the Phase III trials were long-term (up to 12 months), the others were 6 week studies with open-label extensions. These 5 studies were  multiple-dose,  multicentre,  randomised, double-blind  and  parallelgroup in design, and were of adequate size (number of patients between 154 and 215). All patients included  had  been  diagnosed  as  idiopathic  PD  and  had  completed  three  ON/OFF  self-rating  charts before randomisation.

NZ14316 was  a  US  Phase  II  dose  finding  and  efficacy  study.  Patients  received  placebo  (n=42)  or tolcapone  50  mg  (n=41),  200  mg  (n=40),  400  mg  (n=36)  t.i.d.  in  addition  to  their  normal L-dopa/carbidopa  treatment  (total  doses  of  L-dopa  were  982  mg,  916  mg,  771  and  775  mg respectively).  Efficacy  was  based  on  a  physician's  examination  and  ON  time  with  dyskinesia  was formally  recorded.  The  OFF  time  was  significantly  reduced  in  all  tolcapone  groups  compared  to placebo  (p  ‹  0.001)  but  the  improvements  in  ON  time  without  dyskinesia  were  not  significant. Particularly, for the 200 mg dose, the reduction in OFF time seemed to be on the basis of increased ON time with dyskinesia.

BZ14114 was an European/Australian Phase II study comparing placebo (n=42) and tolcapone 50 mg (n=37),  200  mg  (n=38),  400  mg  (n=37)  t.i.d.  in  addition  to  their  normal  L-dopa/carbidopa  or L-dopa/benserazide treatment. ON time was significantly increased for all tolcapone groups compared to placebo (p ≈ 0.01), but reduction in OFF time was only significant for the tolcapone 200 mg group. Improvements  in  UPDRS  total  and  sub-scales  showed  non-significant  trends  in  a  non-dose  related manner.

NZ14654 was a US/Canadian, 13 week Phase III efficacy study, with an extension phase of 9 months. Patients received placebo (n=66) or tolcapone 100 mg (n=69) or 200 mg (n=67) t.i.d. in addition to their  normal  L-dopa/carbidopa  treatment  (total  doses  of  L-dopa  were  948,  789,  and  866  mg/day respectively). The placebo improvement of about 8% was larger than that seen in other studies. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reduction  in  OFF  time  and  increase  in  ON  time  were  significantly  better  for  tolcapone  200  mg (p ‹ 0.01 and 0.05 respectively) compared to placebo. Neither change was statistically significant for tolcapone 100 mg. Results of other indices were discordant, the investigator's global assessment of severity showed a significant improvement but the UPDRS and its sub-scales did not. Analysis of 12 month  data  showed  that  the  reduction  in  L-dopa  dosage  and  in  OFF  time  were  maintained  for  12 months.

NZ14655 was  an  European, 13 week Phase III trial, with an extension phase of 9 months. Patients received  placebo  (n=58)  or  tolcapone  100  mg  (n=60)  or  200  mg  (n=59)  t.i.d.  in  addition  to  their normal  L-dopa/benserazide  treatment.  This  study  demonstrated  that  both  doses  of  tolcapone  were superior  to  placebo  in  producing  a  L-dopa  dose  reduction.  Tolcapone  100  mg  produced  the  largest decrease  in  OFF  time  (p  ‹  0.05),  but  OFF  time  reduction  was  not  significant  for  200  mg  group. Increases  in  ON  time  were  greater  than  placebo  for  both  tolcapone  doses  (p  ‹  0.01).  A  significant improvement  in  the  quality  of  life  measurement  (Sickness  Impact  Profile/Psychosocial  dimension) from the 200 mg group was also observed. Changes recorded at month 3 were generally maintained at the  end  of  the  study  (months  6  and  12).  An  exception  was  the  100  mg  tolcapone  effect  on  L-dopa dosing, which was gradually approaching the placebo level (from weeks 13 to 39).

NN14971 was  a  US/Canadian,  six-week  Phase  III  study.  Patients  received  placebo  (n=72)  or tolcapone  100  mg  (n=69)  or  200  mg  (n=74)  t.i.d.  in  addition  to  their  normal  L-dopa/carbidopa treatment. For both doses, the increase in ON time and reduction in OFF time, estimated by self-rating, were  significantly  better  than  those  of  the  placebo  group.  There  were  minor,  non-significant, improvements in UPDRS.

In addition to the above pivotal trials, NZ14656 was a supportive, open-label, active-controlled study for 8 weeks, comparing tolcapone 200 mg t.i.d. and bromocriptine as add-on therapy in PD patients receiving L-dopa/carbidopa or L-dopa/benserazide. Differences between treatments were not statistically significant.

## Safety at the time of granting of the EU Marketing Authorisation

Altogether 1934 patients participated in 13 clinical trials, 1536 of which received tolcapone and 1378 received at least 6 weeks of treatment, 222 for more than a year.

Deaths - Thirty nine deaths occurred during or after clinical trials, including the extension phases of the studies. Fifteen deaths occurred during the clinical trials, 11 patients had received tolcapone and 4 were in the placebo treatment group. Given the age of the population studied (range 66 - 84 years), a causative relationship between treatment and death is unlikely. However, two deaths in the tolcaponetreated group were rated as possibly due to treatment, a 55 year old women who had diarrhoea and jaundice before her sudden death. The death was attributed to possible cardiac causes. A second case was a patient who died of respiratory failure after discontinuing tolcapone treatment, this event was assessed as probably neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

Adverse  Events -  The  incidence  of  adverse  events  was  higher  in  50,  100  and  200  mg  tolcapone treated  than  placebo  patients.  The  incidence  for  all  adverse  events  in  the  400  mg  tolcapone  treated group  was  lower  than  in  the  placebo  group,  it  is  probably  due  to  the  lack  of  long-term  exposure (&gt; 13 weeks) in the 400 mg tolcapone groups.

As might be expected from a compound which raises L-dopa levels, the most frequent adverse events were  of  a  dopaminergic  nature,  with  dyskinesia  as  the  most  frequent  side-effect.  However,  the population  which  experienced  increased  dyskinesia  did  not  withdraw  from  clinical  trials  in  large numbers.

Nausea was the second most commonly reported adverse event and was more common in females than males.  Other  dopaminergic  adverse  events  reported  were  sleep  disorder,  anorexia,  orthostatism, somnolence, hallucination and vomiting.

The  following  adverse  events  occurred  with  an  incidence  above  2%  for  both  tolcapone  doses compared  with  placebo:  diarrhoea,  headache,  increased  sweating,  xerostomia  and  abdominal  pain. Diarrhoea  was  the  most  commonly  reported  non-dopaminergic  adverse  event,  and  was  often

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

associated with discontinuation of tolcapone. In clinical trials, diarrhoea developed in 16% and 18% of patients  receiving  tolcapone  100  and  200  mg  respectively,  compared  to  8%  of  patients  receiving placebo. It usually began 2 to 6 months after therapy initiation. Cases of respiratory tract infections and influenza were also reported.

Three  cases  of  Neuroleptic  Malignant  Syndrome  have  been  reported  during  tolcapone  treatment, following reduction or discontinuation of tolcapone and other concomitant dopaminergic medications.

As tolcapone and its metabolites are yellow, they can cause a harmless intensification in the colour of the patient's urine.

Laboratory Abnormalities - The only relevant laboratory adverse events occurring during tolcapone treatment  was  elevation  of  liver  transaminases.  Increases  to  more  than  3  times  the  upper  limit  for alanine aminotransferase occurred in 1% of patients receiving tolcapone 100 mg and 3% of patients at 200 mg. The increases usually appeared within 6 weeks to 6 months of starting tolcapone treatment but were transient and reversible. Thus, it  was originally recommended that transaminases had to be monitored when starting tolcapone treatment and monthly for the first 6 months. This frequency has subsequently been increased. The current SPC recommends that liver function tests (SGPT/ALT and SGOT/AST measurements) are to be carried out on alternate weeks for the first year of treatment, four weekly for the following six months and eight weekly thereafter (See 'Discussion on benefit/risk).

Withdrawal Rates - Review of the data suggests a dose response relationship for withdrawals due to diarrhoea, nausea, raised hepatic transaminases, dyskinesia, headache. In clinical trials, diarrhoea lead to withdrawal of 5% and 6% of patients receiving tolcapone 100 and 200 mg respectively, compared to 1% of patients receiving placebo.

In  summary -  In  5  well  conducted  double-blind  clinical  trials  in  fluctuating  patients,  tolcapone consistently  showed  efficacy  superior  to  placebo  in  reducing  the  proportion  of  OFF  time  and increasing the proportion of ON time experienced by PD patients. In a single open-label comparative study,  it  was  shown  that  efficacy  of  tolcapone  and  bromocriptine  did  not  differ.  Patients  with unpredictable  ON/OFF  events  have  not  been  studied.  The  Efficacy  seemed  to  be  maintained throughout 52 weeks. The increase in ON time was gained at the price of increasing dyskinesia.

In  non-fluctuating  PD  patients,  study  BZ14115  resulted  in  wide  and  to  some  extent  non-conclusive confidence intervals. However the point estimates of the effect sizes were similar to study NZ14653 for Motor, ADL-ON and Total score, thus demonstrating consistency between the 2 studies.

Analysis of the frequency of adverse events and withdrawals from clinical trials according to dose of tolcapone showed that dyskinesia, nausea, sleep disorder, anorexia, abnormal dreaming, somnolence and orthostatic complaints were frequent, treatment related and probably mediated through dopaminergic  mechanism.  Diarrhoea  was  frequent.  The  occurrence  of  a  significant  rise  in  liver enzymes in some patients indicates the need for hepatic safety monitoring for the first 6 months of treatment.

## 5. Benefit/Risk Assessment at the time of granting of the EU Marketing Authorisation

Acknowledging the pre-clinical  evidence  that  tolcapone  caused  renal  tumors  in  rats,  with  a  narrow safety margin, the information on BUN, creatinine and proteinuria available from approximately 600 patients treated for 12 months showed no indication of any kidney toxicity.

Tolcapone demonstrated efficacy in fluctuating L-dopa/carbidopa and L-dopa/benserazide treated PD patients. Adverse events associated with its use include dopaminergic effects which can be reduced by lowering  the  L-dopa  dose,  diarrhoea  which  should  be  clinically  monitored,  and  elevated  liver transaminases  which  should  be  monitored  during  the  first  6  months  of  treatment.  The  discrepancy between the frequency of dyskinesia observed in clinical trials and the infrequency of withdrawal due to this effect, suggests that patients may take it as an acceptable trade-off for increased mobility.

Although  the  small  size  and  short  duration  of  the  pivotal  trial,  consistent  results  seems  to  foresee efficacy in non-fluctuating patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tolcapone demonstrated to be a selective, potent and reversible inhibitor of COMT, which enhances the  bioavailability  of  L-dopa  when  co-administered  with  L-dopa  and  a  peripheral  decarboxylase inhibitor.

Based on findings in long-term toxicity studies, the main preclinical concern with respect to human safety was the nephrotoxic potential of tolcapone. This was addressed in the relevant sections of the SPC.

Tasmar  improves  symptom  control  in  PD  patients  with  some  forms  of  ON/OFF  phenomena.  The clinical data supported efficacy in fluctuating patients, especially those with the end of dose wearing off effect.

## 6. POST-MARKETING EXPERIENCE

On the grounds of the above described favourable CPMP Opinion on the benefit/risk balance, on 27 August 1997, the European Commission granted Roche Registration Limited a marketing authorisation for Tasmar.

In November 1998, however, the European Commission requested the Opinion of the EMEA on cases of  hepatotoxicity  and  neuroleptic  malignant-like  syndrome  that  had  been  reported  in  the  postmarketing authorization phase. On 10 November 1998, the CPMP convened an extraordinary meeting to review the cases. Following that meeting, the CPMP adopted, on 12 November 1998, an Opinion recommending  the  suspension  of  the  marketing  authorisation  for  Tasmar,  for  a  period  of  one  year renewable,  due  to  increasing  concerns  over  reports  of  severe  hepatotoxicity,  three  with  a  fatal outcome.

## Background of the suspension

The CPMP initial Opinion (12 November 1998, CPMP/2481/98) recommending the suspension of the Marketing Authorisation for Tasmar, was adopted for the following reasons:

- -serious hepatic reactions occur unpredictably and liver monitoring does not seem able to predict the development of severe, sometimes fatal, hepatic disease;
- -taking into consideration this hepatotoxicity, as well as the possible occurrence of rhabdomyolysis and  neuroleptic  malignant-like  syndrome,  the  overall  benefit/risk  balance  of  tolcapone  was considered to be unfavourable in the authorised indication and it was not felt possible to restrict the indications sufficiently to permit safe use.

In October 1999 (CPMP/2685/99), the CPMP agreed on a further year of suspension. In this context, the CPMP agreed that a decision in lifting the suspension of the Tasmar marketing authorisation could be considered, for a restricted indication, if the following conditions were fulfilled:

1. Evidence of therapeutic  benefit  in  patients  being  switched  to  tolcapone  from  other  COMTinhibitors is provided.
2. A  better insight and understanding  of the safety concerns, hepatitis and Neuroleptic Malignant-like Syndrome, is gained with respect to their incidence, mechanism and the means to prevent their occurrence.
3. The possibility  of  establishing  a  system  of  patient  undertaking  informed  consent  in  the  EU Member States is explored and outlined by the MAH.

On 14 January 2000, the MAH Roche Registration Ltd. requested Scientific  Advice  for  Tasmar in order to best address the points above. The view of CPMP was that if tolcapone was to be reinstated via a positive risk/benefit assessment, then an efficacy advantage over comparable treatments should be demonstrated in a prospective study - the 'switch study'. In addition, certain safety measures would be required together with extensive re-writing of the SPC. Moreover, as the new efficacy data which had  been  submitted  by  the  MAH  did  not  sufficiently  improve  or  expand  the  efficacy  profile  of tolcapone, the CPMP recommended on 19 October 2000 (CPMP/2717/00) that:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The suspension of the marketing authorisation should be renewed for a further year.
- The monthly reporting requirement for the review entitled 'Review on Spontaneous hepatobiliary Adverse Events Associated with Tolcapone' should be set back to a three monthly basis.
- The suspension could be re-evaluated after the provision of the final report of the 'switch study'.

On  19  September  2001,  having  reviewed  the  evidence  submitted  by  the  MAH,  re-assessed  the risk/benefit profile  of  the  medicinal  product,  and  considering  that  a  prospective  trial  against comparable treatments was in progress, the CPMP recommended the renewal of the suspension of the marketing  authorisation  for  a  further  year,  which  could  be  re-evaluated  when  the  results  of  the prospective study would become available.

On 19 September 2002, on the basis of data provided by the MAH and considering the fact that the 'switch study' was in progress but still incomplete, the CPMP concluded that the suspension of the marketing authorisation should be renewed for a further year.

On 22 October 2003, the CPMP adopted an Opinion, recommending the renewal of the suspension of the  marketing authorisation for Tasmar, for a further year. However, the CPMP agreed on a list of outstanding  issues  to  be  addressed  by  the  MAH  focussing  on  the  submission  of  revised  product information and proposals for safety measures relating to the possible re-introduction of Tasmar into the EU market.

## Lifting of the suspension

On 16 February 2004, the MAH submitted documentation to support the lifting of the suspension of the  Marketing  Authorisation  for  Tasmar,  addressing  the  issues  raised  by  CPMP  during  its  October 2003 plenary meeting, including a proposal to ensure safe use of Tasmar, a communication plan to prescribers and revised Product Information.

The above information complemented the bulk of the safety and clinical data submitted by the MAH on 15 July 2003 to support the review of the suspension of the marketing authorisation. This request was based on new data from the now completed Switch study and information on safety data. These data included a comprehensive safety update report with a critical review of all hepatotoxicity data; an update of the ongoing and completed clinical trials since the granting of the marketing authorisation (including a  study  report  on  the  \"switch  study\",  entitled 'Entacapone to Tolcapone switch study to determine  whether  Tolcapone  can  improve  patients  receiving  optimal  treatment  with  Entacapone' ) and analysis of the overall benefit/risk profile.

## Clinical aspects

The CPMP had indicated in January 2000 that in order to reinstate tolcapone via a positive risk/benefit assessment, an efficacy advantage over similar treatments should be demonstrated to offset the possible higher risk attached to the use of tolcapone. As entacapone was at the time the only other COMT inhibitor authorised in the EU, the MAH was asked to perform a comparative study of tolcapone and entacapone (Switch study).

## Method

The 'Switch study' is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study with an open optimisation phase. It was conducted between July 2000 and December 2002.

## 1 Inclusion/Exclusion criteria

Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease of at least five years duration were eligible for inclusion if they  continued  to  experience  significant  fluctuations  and  impairment  of  activities  of  daily  living despite being on optimal medical therapy. At entry, patients were to be on levodopa at a daily dose of 400 - 3000 mg and entacapone 200 mg co-administered with each dose of levodopa, with a maximum of ten daily doses.  Exclusion criteria were a history of liver disease or other concurrent serious illness.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2 Study design

Eligible patients entered an initial open treatment optimisation phase with entacapone, during which their levodopa dose was adjusted in order to achieve the best balance between efficacy and tolerability (see Table 1).

Following treatment optimisation (at least ten days), if patients had at least 3 hours OFF-time while on the optimal levodopa regimen, they were randomised to a three week double blind phase in which they would either continue entacapone or switch to tolcapone. Treatments were one tablet (100 mg tolcapone) with the first morning dose of levodopa and subsequently with the dose nearest to six and twelve hours later or one capsule (200 mg entacapone) with each dose of levodopa. While on double-blind  treatment,  the  levodopa  dose  was  again  adjusted  in  order  to  optimize  the  levodopa regimen for use with the randomized treatment.

Table 1 - Overview of study design

| Screening   | Open Optimisation Phase ≥ 10 days   | Randomisation Day -1/1   | Double-Blind Phase Week 1 Week 2 Week 3                |

*In combination with levodopa and other existing anti-Parkinson's agents.

**Planned sample size.

## 3 Efficacy parameters

The  primary  efficacy  parameter  was  the  proportion  of  responders  in  each  group.  A  response  was defined as an increase in ON-time (without disabling dyskinesias) of at least one hour per day. ON and OFF-times were taken as an average over the last three days of each study week and were recorded by means of a patient diary.

The secondary efficacy parameter was the proportion of patients experiencing a moderate to marked improvement as judged by the investigator's clinical impression at the final visit.

Tertiary  efficacy  parameters  were  the  change  in  the  Unified  Parkinson's  Disease  Rating  Scale (UPDRS) and the change in total daily levodopa dose during the double-blind period. These were to be analysed if the analyses of the first and secondary parameters led to inconclusive results.

## 4 Statistical hypothesis and analytical plan

The power calculation was based on a projected response rate of 5% in the entacapone group and 25% in the tolcapone group. This required 80 patients per treatment to give a power of 92% with two-way α =  5%.  In  fact,  the  proportion  of  responders  in  the  entacapone  group  was  almost  47%.  Thus,  in retrospect the study was considerably underpowered.

Efficacy parameters were analysed as 'all patients treated' (APT) and 'per protocol' (PP) populations. The APT population included all patients who were randomised to drug and received at least one dose of  study  medication.  The  PP  population  included  all  patients  who  were  randomised  to  drug  and completed the study in accordance with the protocol. The primary analyses were based on the APT population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5 Results

One hundred and seventy-eight patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 150 were randomised into two groups of 75 each, either on talcapone or entacapone treatment.  In each group 71 patients completed the study; reasons for exclusion and non-completion were very similar between groups.

There were 4 premature withdrawals from the study in each group. Of these, 2 in the entacapone group and one in the tolcapone group were due to safety reasons. The remaining withdrawals were due to violation of selection criteria at entry and other non-safety reasons.



Primary efficacy parameter - For the APT population, a higher proportion of patients in the tolcapone group (53%) experienced an average increase in ON-time of ≥ 1 hour per day than in the entacapone

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

group (43%), but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (p=0.191).  Similar results were seen in the PP population, with approximately 58% of the tolcapone group and 47% of the entacapone group classified as responders.

Secondary  efficacy  parameter -  For  the  APT  population,  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the tolcapone group (39%) than in the entacapone group (25%) were judged by the investigator to have shown a marked or moderate global improvement in their Parkinson's disease at the end of the study, but the difference between groups was not statistically significant.  Similar results were seen in the PP population,  with  approximately  40%  of  the  tolcapone  group  and  27%  of  the  entacapone  group showing marked or moderate improvement.

Tertiary  efficacy  parameters -  Mean  changes  in  total  daily  levodopa  dose  during  the  double-blind phase  were  minimal  in  both  the  tolcapone  (-2.26%)  and  the  entacapone  (-0.39%)  groups.    Slight improvements in mean UPDRS scores were seen between the beginning and end of the double-blind phase in both treatment groups (APT population).  The tolcapone-treated patients showed the largest improvements  for  both  subscales,  with  the  greatest  difference  between  groups  seen  in  the  motor examination subscale.

## Conclusions on the 'Switch Study'

## Efficacy

The study shows a modest but consistent efficacy advantage for tolcapone over entacapone.

Although none of the efficacy criteria demonstrated a statistically significant advantage for tolcapone over entacapone, all criteria (four in total) showed a trend or numerical advantage, suggesting that the outcome was more likely to be due to a therapeutic advantage than to a chance finding.

Due  to  the  unexpectedly  high  response  rate  (43%)  in  the  entacapone  group,  the  MAH's  statistical power calculation was, in retrospect, ill founded, and the study was not sufficiently powered to detect statistically significant difference between the groups.

## Safety conclusions of the Switch study

Fifty-three percent of patients in the tolcapone group and 57 % in the entacapone group experienced at least  one  adverse  event  (AE)  during  the  study.  The  most  common  event  was  dyskinesia,  which occurred in 29% of the entacapone group and 31% of the tolcapone group. All other AEs reported were experienced by less than 5% of patients. A slightly higher number of AEs were reported for the tolcapone  group  overall , but there  were  no  marked  differences  between  groups  in  the  number  of patients  reporting  AEs  or  in  the  types  of  AE  experienced.  No  hepatobiliary  AEs  were  reported  for either treatment group.

The majority of AEs in both treatment groups were considered by the investigator to be either mild or moderate in intensity. One adverse event in the entacapone group (dyskinesia) and 6 adverse events in the tolcapone group (dyskinesia, anxiety, and gastrointestinal disorders) were classified as severe.

There  was  one  serious  adverse  event  (SAE)  in  the  tolcapone  group  reported  during  the  study. A 68-year old man experienced three episodes with abdominal pain and was hospitalised for 7 days. The event resolved without sequelae following treatment. The SAE was judged to be remotely related to study treatment.

One  patient  in  the  tolcapone  group  had  a  marked  laboratory  test  value  abnormality  and  was subsequently  withdrawn  from  the  study.  This  51-year-old  male  patient  had  a  prior  history  of alcoholism  that  had  been  resolved  for  3  months.    Aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  levels  were normal at screening, randomisation and week 1 visits. However, at the week 2 visit, he had an elevated AST level of 55 U/L (reference range, 0-25 U/L). When retested the following day, the AST level had reduced to 28 U/L, but was still outside the standard reference range. Thus, in accordance with the protocol, this patient was withdrawn from the study on day 14.

There were no deaths reported during the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## OVERALL SAFETY

In accordance with their letter of undertaking to CPMP dated 21 October 1998, a total of 36 reports entitled  'Review  on  Spontaneous  hepatobiliary  Adverse  Events  Associated  with  Tolcapone'  were produced by the MAH, the last of which was received by the EMEA on 10 March 2004.

Since  the  International  Birthday,  nine  Periodic  Safety  Update  Reports  have  been  submitted.  The conclusions  of  the  assessment  of  the  latest  PSUR  were  that  no  new  information  arose  to  alter  the CPMP opinion  that  the  suspension  of  the  marketing  authorisation  could  be  lifted  given  agreement between CPMP and the MAH about appropriate controls of use.

In  the  US,  the  marketing  authorisation  was  not  suspended,  but  the  FDA  revised  the  prescribing information  to  recommend  more  stringent  monitoring  of  potential  hepatotoxicity  and  restricted availability. Similar actions were taken in Switzerland.

The  safety  picture  is  therefore  completed  by  the  fact  that  experience  with  tolcapone  where  it  has remained available has shown that there was a significant decline of the incidence of reported cases of acute hepatitis or massive liver injury after the introduction of more stringent liver function monitoring and closer attention to the monitoring of possible signs and symptoms of underlying liver disease.

## DISCUSSION ON BENEFIT/RISK

The 'Switch' study showed a trend towards efficacy. This modest efficacy advantage for tolcapone over entacapone suggests that Tasmar could offer an alternative treatment to patients not adequately responding to available medications.

Two restrictions to the prescribing information were introduced:

- -the  indication  is  being  restricted  to  'patients  failing  to  respond  to  or  intolerant  of  other COMT inhibitors', in line with the principles of the US and Swiss labelling texts, that have demonstrated to ensure sufficiently safe use of Tasmar;
- -the duration of treatment in case of failure of the therapy to show clinical benefits is being limited to three weeks. The new wording for the sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the SPC is as follows ' If substantial clinical benefits are not seen within 3 weeks of the initiation of the treatment, Tasmar should be discontinued .'

Additionally,  a  further  restriction  in  the  prescription  of  Tasmar  was  agreed,  in  the  form  of  the following  sentence  in  section  4.2  of  the  SPC:  ' The  administration  of  Tasmar  is  restricted  to prescription and supervision by physicians experienced in the management of advanced Parkinson's disease '. This wording entailed a change in the legal status of the product. As a consequence, Annex II to the Commission Decision has been revised to list the legal status as 'Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription' .

The restriction to specialist use is similar to the practice in the US and Switzerland. In the US, Tasmar may be used only by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with the prescribing information and the safety  warnings  that  it  contains,  and  can  not  be  used  without  written  informed  consent  from  the patient. In Switzerland, Tasmar use must be initiated and supervised by a consultant neurologist.

Specific wording has also been introduced in the SPC to instruct prescribers that liver function tests (SGPT/ALT and SGOT/AST measurements) are to be carried out on alternate weeks for the first year of  treatment,  four  weekly  for  the  following  six  months  and  eight  weekly  thereafter.  The  SPC  also indicates that, if the dose is raised to 200 mg t.i.d. the physician should check liver enzymes prior to initiating the higher dose and the monitoring scheme should be re-set from the beginning, as above.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A revised section on contraindications was also required to ensure a safe use of the product. The onset of severe hepatic injury has never been observed during the first three weeks of treatment. Therefore physicians  are  able  to  identify  the  individual  benefit  of  Tasmar  during  this  period.  Thus,  dosage limitations have also been introduced to limit (to three weeks) the time period between initiation of therapy with Tasmar and its discontinuation in case it fails to show clinical benefits (See sections 4.3 and 4.1 of the SPC, respectively).

Other  SPC  modifications  to  incorporate  thorough  instructions  on  liver  function  checks  prior  to commencing  the  therapy  and  its  monitoring  during  the  treatment  satisfactorily  address  the  safety concerns over hepatic reactions. In Switzerland and the US, where Tasmar has been on the market throughout the EU suspension, liver function monitoring is recommended as it is now done in the EU SPC. Having monitoring recommendations in the European Union mirroring these successfully tested measures is considered to enable sufficiently safe reintroduction of Tasmar in the EU.

In  addition  to  the  major  changes  made  to  ensure  safe  use,  described  above,  the  SPC  underwent extensive re-writing (with corresponding changes to the Package Leaflet), and almost all of its sections are affected by changes.

It  was  considered that the  revision that  the  SPC underwent, satisfactorily addresses the  concerns  of neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome (NMS) and rhabdomyolysis and should minimise the risk of new cases of NMS. The basis for the revision focussed mainly on three points:

-  Contraindication in patients with a previous history of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Symptom Complex (NMS) and /or non-traumatic Rhabdomyolysis or hyperthermia;
-  Introduction of contraindications in patients with severe dyskinesia. Warnings  were  also introduced  to  state  that  patients  receiving  multiple  medications  with  effects  on  different  CNS pathways

(e.g. antidepressants, neuroleptics, anticholinergics) may be at greater risk of developing NMS);

-  Consider increasing the patient's levodopa dose on Tasmar discontinuation.

In  order  to  follow  the  spontaneous  reports  following  re-introduction  of  Tasmar  to  the  EU,  it  was considered appropriate to re-set the PSUR cycle as described in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93, article 22(2).

The MAH will expedite all serious hepatic reactions and NMS occurring outside the EU to the EMEA (Eudravigilance System) and all EU National Competent Authorities.

The MAH will carry out targeted follow up of case reports of hepatic adverse reactions including LFT values, values registered and dates in which tests were performed, liver biopsy if available, relevant past medical history and concomitant medication or alcohol use.

## CONCLUSIONS ON BENEFIT / RISK

Having  reviewed  the  data  submitted  by  the  MAH  in  the  context  of  the  suspension  and  having  reassessed the benefit/risk profile of the medicinal product, it was considered that:

- More stringent  liver  function  monitoring  and  closer  attention  to  the  monitoring  of  possible signs and symptoms of underlying liver disease will be introduced;
- Introduction of contraindications that Tasmar should not be prescribed for patients with severe dyskinesia or with a previous history of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Symptom Complex (NMS) and /or non-traumatic Rhabdomyolysis and hyperthermia;
- Based  on  accumulating  data,  there  is  better  insight  and  understanding  of  safety  concerns, hepatitis  and  neuroleptic  malignant-like  syndrome,  with  respect  to  their  incidence  and  the means to prevent their occurrence;

- In  a  short  duration  (three  week)  study  there  was  limited  evidence  of  a  modest  efficacy advantage for tolcapone over entacapone in the control of motor fluctuations in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease;
- The legal status of Tasmar will change to be restricted to prescription by physicians experienced in the management of advanced Parkinson's disease;
- The product information has been revised to introduce a restricted therapeutic indication as well as contraindications and additional warnings and precautions.

## OVERALL CONCLUSIONS

Based on review of the newly available information, it was considered that the safety and the efficacy of Tasmar  is  adequately  and  sufficiently  demonstrated  and  therefore,  after re-evaluation, the benefit/risk profile of Tasmar is now favourable for the treatment of levodopa-responsive patients with idiopathic  Parkinson's  disease  and  motor  fluctuations,  who  failed  to  respond  to  or  are  intolerant  of other COMT inhibitors.

The lifting of the suspension of the Marketing Authorisation for Tasmar was therefore agreed, on the following conditions:

- The Periodic Safety Update Reports cycle will be re-set as for newly approved products as described Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93.

The  lifting  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  suspension  required  amendments  to  the  terms  of  the Community Marketing Authorisation. The following annexes were amended: I, II and IIIB.
