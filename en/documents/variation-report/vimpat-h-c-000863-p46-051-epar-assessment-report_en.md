## 1. Introduction

On 01 April 2024 the MAH submitted the results of EP0144, a completed study including paediatric patients for VIMPAT (Lacosamide) in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

According to the regulatory requirements of China health authority, multinational pharmaceutical companies with operations in China are requested to conduct drug safety surveillance within 5 years following Import Drug License (IDL) approval. This type of study is termed Drug Intensive Monitoring (DIM). During a DIM, general population surveillance should be used unless otherwise requested for a special reason (such as requested or permitted by the drug regulatory authority). It was recommended to conduct a prospective observational study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The study included patients ≥ 4 years old with a diagnosis of epilepsy with partial-onset seizures (POS). Start of data collection was 30 Sep 2021 and end of data collection 18 oct 2023.

The patient was being prescribed VIMPAT (LCM) by the treating physician, per the current prescribing information in mainland China at the time of patient enrolment. Lacosamide was approved in China in Dec 2018 as adjunctive therapy in patients with POS ≥ 16 years old.  In Aug 2019 it was approved for the same indication in pediatric patients ≥4 years old. In Jul 2020, oral solution formulation of VIMPAT(LCM) was approved.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

Postmarketing Safety and Effectiveness of Novel Antiepileptic Drug VIMPAT ®  (Lacosamide) in Mainland Chinese Patient Populations. A Multicenter Prospective Noninterventional Drug Intensive Monitoring Study.

Study number EP0144

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

EP0144: Safety and Effectiveness of Novel Antiepileptic Drug VIMPAT ®  (Lacosamide) in Mainland Chinese Patient Populations. A Multicenter Prospective Noninterventional Drug Intensive Monitoring Study.

## Description

EP0144 was a postmarketing surveillance study with a 24-week Observation Period. It was designed as a multicenter, prospective NIS to fulfil the regulatory requirements of China health authority by assessing the safety and effectiveness profiles of VIMPAT   (lacosamide) in real-world clinical practice in Chinese epilepsy patients ≥4 years old with partial-onset seizures (POS). Patients were recruited from 29 hospitals across mainland China. Four visits were planned over 24 weeks (i.e., at Weeks 1, 4, 12, and 24).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Study participants

Adult and pediatric epilepsy patients ≥4 years old with POS who were prescribed and received VIMPAT (LCM) for up to 14 days before enrolment were recruited for participation. Concomitant AEDs were allowed.

## Inclusion criteria

2. A Data Consent form was signed and dated by the patient or by the parent(s) or legal representative.

3.The patient was a male or female ≥4 years old.

4.The patient had a diagnosis of epilepsy with partial-onset seizures (also called focal-onset seizures according to ILAE classification [2017]). The results of ≥1 prior electroencephalogram(s) were consistent with this diagnosis.

5. The patient was being prescribed VIMPAT (LCM) by the treating physician, per the current prescribing information in mainland China at the time of patient enrolment.

6. The patient had ≥1 partial-onset seizure (focal-onset seizure) in the 12 weeks prior to the first dose of VIMPAT (LCM).

## Exclusion criteria

1. Patient was taking LCM generic at the time of enrolment or had been taking LCM generic before enrolment.

2. The patient was taking VIMPAT (LCM) for more than 2 weeks before study inclusion.

3. The patient had been previously enrolled in a clinical study for VIMPAT (or LCM).

4. The patient was contraindicated to VIMPAT (or LCM) according to the package insert (including allergy, severe comorbidities, etc).

5. Any other reason that, in the treating physician's opinion, made the patient unsuitable to participate in this study.

## Treatments

The patient was being prescribed VIMPAT (LCM) by the treating physician, per the current prescribing information in mainland China at the time of patient enrolment.

## Objective(s)

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety profile .

The secondary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness profile .

Other objectives of the study were to further evaluate the safety and quality of life profiles of VIMPAT (LCM).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes/endpoints

- The primary variable selected to assess the safety profile were:

-Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported by the patient to the treating physician or observed by the treating physician. (A TEAE was defined as an AE that had onset or worsened on or after the date of the first dose of VIMPA (LCM), or up to 30 days after the last dose).

-Treatment-emergent AEs leading to withdrawal of VIMPAT (LCM)

-Treatment-emergent adverse drug reactions (ADRs)

-Treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs)

-Treatment-emergent serious ADRs (SADRs)

-Treatment-emergent ADRs leading to withdrawal of VIMPAT (LCM)

- The secondary variables chosen to assess the effectiveness profile of VIMPAT (LCM) were:

-Retention of VIMPAT (LCM) at Weeks 12 and 24 of the Observation Period

-Seizure-free status per patient diary report during the first 12 and 24 weeks of VIMPAT (LCM) treatment among those who completed the 24-week observation period

-Percentage of seizure-free days during the first 12 and 24 weeks among those who completed the 24-week Observation Period

-Response (50%) per patient diary report from Baseline to the Termination/Early Termination Visit among those who completed the 24-week Observation Period

-Response (50%) per patient diary report from Baseline to the Termination/Early Termination Visit among those who completed the 24-week Observation Period by subgroup analysis

-Response (75%) per patient diary report from Baseline to the Termination/Early Termination Visit among those who completed the 24-week Observation Period

-Absolute change in seizure frequency per 28 days from Baseline to the Termination/Early Termination Visit

-Percentage change in seizure frequency per 28 days from Baseline to the Termination/Early Termination Visit

- Other objectives of the study to further evaluate the safety and quality of life

The following health outcomes variables were used in this study:

-The CGIC and PGIC/Caregiver GIC at the Termination Visit or Early Termination Visit

-Change from Baseline in QOLIE-31-P scores (Total, subscales, Health status and Distress) over time in adult patients

-Change from Baseline in PedsQL™ scores (Total, Physical, Emotional, Social and School functioning) over time in nonadult study patients

-Change from Baseline in the GAD-7 score over time in adult study patients

- -Change from Baseline in the C-NDDI-E score over time in adult study patients

The following healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) outcomes were assessed:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Medical procedures
- -Healthcare provider consultations, including general practitioner and specialist visits
- -Emergency room visits
- -Hospitalizations

## Sample size

There was no formal statistical sample size calculation done for this NIS. To obtain a safety profile of VIMPAT (LCM), taking into consideration some drop out during the study period, a sample of 3000 eligible patients was planned for the study. Due to the unexpected recruitment challenges of the study and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the sample size was changed from 3000 patients to 800 to 1000 patients.

With the reduced sample size, the chance of observing at least 1 patient with an AE with an incidence rate of 0.2%, was still 80%.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

NA

## Statistical Methods

Descriptive statistics were used to provide an overview of the safety and effectiveness results. The label used in presentations was 'All Patients.'

Some safety and effectiveness variables were analysed in patients with VIMPAT (LCM) as adjunctive therapy and as monotherapy separately (subgroup analyses). A patient was a monotherapy patient if he/she started on VIMPAT (LCM) monotherapy no later than Visit 2 and stayed on it until the last visit of the study. Whenever a concomitant AED was present during the time between Visit 2 to the last visit, the patient was assigned to the adjunctive treatment group. For the duration of the study, a patient was either assigned to the monotherapy group only or to the adjunctive treatment group only. A patient could not switch between groups, and both groups were mutually exclusive.

Patients without valid data consent were excluded from all analysis sets.

- Enrolled Set

The Enrolled Set (ES) consisted of all patients in the study who gave data consent. The ES was used for patient disposition and patient data listings only.

- Safety Set

The Safety Set (SS) consisted of all enrolled patients in the study who were administered at least 1 dose of VIMPAT (LCM) during the study. This was the analysis set for all safety variables and nonseizure-related other variables (treatment pattern).

- Full Analysis Set

The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all enrolled patients who were in the SS, had at least 1 day with seizure information collected after the first dosing, and met the eligibility criteria. The FAS was used for all seizure-related variables and CGIC, PGIC/Caregiver GIC, patient- and clinician- reported outcomes, and HCRU.

## Assessor's comment

EP0144 was a postmarketing surveillance study with a 24-week observation period. It was designed as a multicenter, prospective non-interventional study (NIS) to fulfil the regulatory requirements of China health authority by assessing the safety (primary outcome) and effectiveness (secondary outcome) profiles of VIMPAT (lacosamide) in real-world clinical practice.  Adult and paediatric epilepsy patients aged ≥4 years with partial-onset seizures (POS), who were prescribed and received VIMPAT (LCM) for up to 14 days before enrolment, were recruited for participation. Concomitant anti-epileptic drugs (AED) were allowed. Four visits were scheduled over the 24-week period (at Weeks 1, 4, 12, and 24). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were reasonable. No formal statistical sample size calculation was conducted for this NIS. Descriptive statistics were used to present an overview of the safety and effectiveness results.

The design of the postmarketing surveillance study was acceptable. Data from adult patients were collected in the study but the focus of this P 46 report is on children aged ≥4 years to &lt;18-year-old

## Results

## Recruitment

Patients were recruited from 29 hospitals across mainland China. Patients who took VIMPAT (LCM) for up to 14 days prior to Visit 1, could be retrospectively included in this study.

Due to the unexpected recruitment challenges of the study and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the sample size was changed from 3000 patients to 800 to 1000 patients.

## Number analysed

A total of 900 patients were enrolled at 29 sites across mainland China. All 900 patients were included in the Enrolled Set, 866 patients in the SS, and 821 patients in the FAS. Of the 487 pediatric patients who started the study in the SS, a total of 426 pediatric patients completed the study and 61 pediatric patients discontinued the study.

## Baseline data

- Patient demographics

The mean age of pediatric patients was 8.5 years (range: 4 years to 17 years). The proportion of male pediatric patients was slightly higher than the proportion of female pediatric patients (55.2% and 44.8%, respectively). All pediatrics patients were Asian and not of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity; the majority of pediatric patients were of Han ethnic descent.

## · Seizure classification

UCB acknowledges that the commonly accepted International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Classification of the Epilepsies has changed (2017). For consistency in terminology across the development program, the old seizure classification terminology (ILAE, 1989) has been used.

All pediatric patients had an ILAE seizure classification history of POS. Partial-onset seizures were most commonly classified as simple partial (IA) seizures (58.1%), and other classifications within POS included complex partial (IB) seizures (27.7%) and partial evolving to secondarily generalized (IC) seizures (19.5%). Please see Table 2-2: below for classification.

A summary of ILAE seizure classification history in pediatric patients is presented for the SS in Table 22:

## · Seizure history

The median duration of epilepsy at study entry for pediatric patients was just over 6 months (0.055 years), and the median age at diagnosis of epilepsy was 7.0 years (Table 2-3). All pediatric patients experienced at least 1 seizure within 12 weeks prior to the first dose of VIMPAT (LCM). The median POS count within 12 weeks prior to the first dose of VIMPAT (LCM) for pediatric patients was 2.0.

Of the 866 patients in the SS, 748 (86.4%) completed the study. A total of 118 (13.6%) patients discontinued the study (Table 2-4). The primary reasons for study discontinuation (≥2% of patients), were not due to ADRs but were due to consent withdrawn by parent/guardian (4.5%) or consent withdrawn by patient (2.9%), and 'other' (2.3%). More patients discontinued the study in the adjunctive therapy group (17.6%) as compared with the monotherapy group (8.8%). The primary reasons for study discontinuation in the monotherapy group were consent withdrawn by parent/guardian or patient; the primary reasons for discontinuation in the adjunctive therapy group were more evenly distributed.

AE=adverse event; LCM=lacosamide; SS=Safety Set

Note: Started study consisted of all patients in the study who had given data consent and received at least 1 dose of VIMPAT (LCM).

Note: Completed study was defined as completed the 24-week Observation Period.

Of the 487 pediatric patients who started the study in the SS, a total of 426 pediatric patients completed the study and 61 pediatric patients discontinued the study. The most common reason for study discontinuation (n=38) was consent withdrawn by parent/guardian (not due to AE).

A total of 4 pediatric patients had nonfatal AEs that resulted in discontinuation of the study and VIMPAT (LCM) treatment.

## Assessor's comment

In the safety set, patients younger than 18 years old comprised approximately 56% of all patients (487/866). The mean age of paediatric patients was 8.5 years. The median POS count within 12 weeks prior to the first dose of VIMPAT (LCM) was 2 (range 1-560). A total of 185 paediatric patients (38.0%) received any prior AEDs. The most common prior AEDs were levetiracetam, valproate sodium and oxcarbazepine.

A total of 426 paediatric patients completed the study and 61 paediatric patients discontinued. The most common reason for study discontinuation (n=38) was consent withdrawn by parent/guardian (not due to AE).

The documentation and patients' characteristics seem reasonable.

## Safety results (Primary objective)

## · Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)

A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an AE that had onset or worsened on or after the date of the first dose of VIMPAT (LCM), or up to 30 days after the last dose of VIMPAT (LCM).

Overall, 137 pediatric patients (28.1%) reported a total of 261 TEAEs (Table 2-6). A total of four pediatric patients (0.8%) reported 4 TEAEs leading to withdrawal from the study and from VIMPAT (LCM). The TEAEs leading to withdrawal were dizziness, hypersensitivity, lethargy, and rash (1 pediatric patient each). A total of 18 pediatric patients (3.7%) reported 19 treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs).

All TEAEs by PT reported in pediatric patients were mild or moderate in maximum intensity, with the exception of 1 severe TEAE of upper respiratory tract infection bacterial. No deaths were reported in pediatric patients.

Note: n=number of patients reporting at least 1 TEAE in that category.

Note: [#] was the number of individual occurrences of the TEAE in that category.

Note: Patient discontinuations due to TEAEs were counted as discontinuation from VIMPAT (LCM).

The percentages of pediatric patients with any TEAEs were comparable in the monotherapy treatment group (28.4%) and adjunctive treatment group (27.6%). The percentages of pediatric patients with treatment-emergent SAEs and TEAEs leading to withdrawal from the study and from VIMPAT (LCM) were lower in the monotherapy treatment group (2.3% and 0.3%, respectively) compared with the adjunctive treatment group (6.1% and 1.7%, respectively).

The incidence of TEAEs reported by ≥1% of pediatric patients by PT is presented for the SS in Table 27 .

Treatment-emergent adverse events were most frequently reported in the SOC of Infections and infestations (11.7%) (Table 2-7). The most frequently reported TEAE by PT was upper respiratory tract infection (6.4%).

## · Other significant TEAEs

Based on safety data from clinical studies with VIMPAT (LCM) and general safety considerations, additional TEAEs were given special consideration. These TEAEs were termed other significant TEAEs. The TEAEs considered other significant TEAEs are, Hepatotoxicity related terms, Cardiacand electrocardiogram (ECG)-related terms and Suicidality-related terms.

In the SS, 2 (0.2%) patients had AESIs and other significant TEAEs. The AESIs (PTs) and other significant TEAEs were atrioventricular block second degree and ventricular tachycardia (1 [0.1%] patient each). Both events were not serious and did not result in a dose change of VIMPAT (LCM). The AESI of ventricular tachycardia was reported as related to VIMPAT (LCM).

## Assessor ' s comment

To assess the cases of other significant TEAEs (atrioventricular block second degree and ventricular tachycardia) the narratives were selected from the dossier and summarised by the assessor.

## A case of atrioventricular block second degree

A pediatric patient experienced second-degree atrioventricular block (type 1) and cardiomegaly 107 days after VIMPAT (LCM) initiation. The dose of VIMPAT (LCM) was reported as not changed due to the second-degree atrioventricular block and cardiomegaly. The AV block II was reported as resolved while cardiomegaly was reported as not resolved. The events were considered not related to VIMPAT (LCM) by the MAH.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The event of second-degree atrioventricular block resolved during continued medication with VIMPAT (LCM) at an unchanged dose. The assessor therefore agrees with the MAH, that the event probably not was related to the medical product. However, AV block II is included in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.

## A case of ventricular tachycardia

It is noticed that this case concerns an adult patient. However, since the event was ventricular tachycardia (VT), and the MAH stated (in the body text page 10/83) that the event was related to VIMPAT (LCM) it was important to assess the case, regardless of the age of the patient.

The patient experienced continuous VT 161 days after VIMPAT (LCM) initiation. The event was considered medically significant and related to VIMPAT (LCM). The patients received treatment with herbal preparations. The action with VIMPAT (LCM) was dose not changed due to the VT. The event resolved 5 days after onset.

The assessor believes there is something in the description of the case that does not match, regarding the diagnosis and/or management of the condition. It must be extremely rare to survive 5 days of continuous VT and to treat VT with herbal medicines only. VT episodes lasting more than av few seconds, called sustained VT, can be life threatening. Treatment for VT include medicines approved for this specific indication and /or an electrical shock to the heart.

Due to questionable medical data, it is not possible to assess the case. However, VT is included in the SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8.

## · Treatment-emergent adverse drug reactions (ADRs)

An adverse event was considered an ADR if the relationship to the study medication collected was 'related' .

Overall, 41 pediatric patients (8.4%) reported a total of 50 treatment-emergent ADRs ( Table 2.9 ). A total of 3 pediatric patients (0.6%) reported 3 treatment-emergent serious ADRs PTs of dermatitis allergic, epilepsy, and upper respiratory tract infection (1 pediatric patient each) ( Table 2.9 ). A total of 4 pediatric patients (0.8%) reported 4 treatment-emergent ADRs leading to withdrawal from the study and from VIMPAT (LCM) (PTs of dizziness, hypersensitivity, lethargy, and rash) (1 pediatric patient each).

The percentages of pediatric patients with any treatment-emergent ADRs and treatment-emergent ADRs leading to withdrawal from the study and from VIMPAT (LCM) were lower in the monotherapy treatment group (6.2% and 0.3%, respectively) compared with the adjunctive treatment group (12.2% and 1.7%, respectively). The percentages of pediatric patients with treatment-emergent serious ADRs were comparable in the monotherapy treatment group (0.3%) and adjunctive treatment group (1.1%).

An overview of treatment-emergent adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in pediatric patients is presented for the SS in Table 2.9.

Note: [#] was the number of individual occurrences of the treatment-emergent ADR in that category.

Note: Patient discontinuations due to treatment-emergent ADRs were counted as discontinuation from

VIMPAT (LCM).

Note: An adverse event was considered an ADR if the relationship to the study medication collected was 'related' from the Case Report Form.

## Assessor's comment

Three paediatric patients reported 3 treatment-emergent serious ADRs (dermatitis allergic, epilepsy, and upper respiratory tract infection [one patient each]).

Four paediatric patients reported 4 treatment-emergent ADRs leading to withdrawal from the study and from VIMPAT (LCM) (PTs of dizziness, hypersensitivity, lethargy and rash [one patient each])

No new safety concerns were reported.

## Efficacy results (secondary objective=effectiveness)

The following sections describe the effectiveness results för paediatric patients in EP0144.

- Retention rate

The retention rate, defined as the percentage of patients remaining in the study and on VIMPAT (LCM) treatment based on SS, was 91.0% at Week 12 and 87.9% at Week 24

- Seizure-free status in paediatric patients who completed the 24-week Observation Period

A summary of seizure-free status at Baseline, Week 12, and Week 24 in pediatric patients who completed the 24-week Observation Period is presented for the Full Analysis Set (FAS) in Table 2-7 .

Seizure-free status and seizure-free days were assessed in pediatric patients who completed the 24-week Observation Period. The percentage of pediatric patients who achieved seizure freedom from Baseline to Week 12 and from Baseline to Week 24 was 62.9% and 55.9%, respectively. Compared with Baseline, the mean number and percentage of seizure-free days were comparable at Week 12 but were higher at Week 24.

## · Seizure frequency per 28 days

A summary of 28-day POS frequency in pediatric patients is presented for the FAS in Table 2-11.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Change from Baseline in 28-day POS frequency was assessed in pediatric patients who completed the 24-week Observation Period and in pediatric patients who had an Early Termination Visit. The median absolute change from Baseline in 28-day POS frequency was -0.36 during the first 12 weeks and -0.67 during the second 12 weeks. At the Early Termination Visit, the median absolute change from Baseline in 28-day POS frequency was -0.33. The median percent change from Baseline in 28-day POS frequency was -100.00% at all timepoints.

## · 50% responder in POS frequency in paediatric patients who completed the 24-week Observation Period

A 50% response rate in POS frequency was assessed for the FAS in the 415 pediatric patients who completed the 24-week Observation Period. The percentage of 50% responders (i.e. , ≥50% reductions in POS frequency from Baseline) was 76.6% at Week 12 and 79.8% at Week 24.

## · Effectiveness conclusions

The evidence of effectiveness in a real-world setting for pediatric Chinese patients in EP0144 supports the use of VIMPAT (LCM) for the treatment of POS in pediatric patients ≥4 years to &lt;18 years of age.

The retention rate remained high (&gt;85%) throughout the 24-week Observation Period. The percentage

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of 50% responders (ie, ≥50% reductions in POS frequency from Baseline) in pediatric patients who completed the 24-week Observation Period was high and remained stable throughout the study, with 76.6% at Week 12 and 79.8% at Week 24. More than half of the pediatric patients who completed the 24-week Observation Period achieved seizure freedom from Baseline to Week 12 (62.9%) and to Week 24 (55.9%).

Per the EP0144 protocol, the secondary variable of 50% responder in POS frequency among those who completed the 24-week Observation Period was the only effectiveness variable planned to be assessed as part of the subgroup analyses. As described in EP0144 final report Section 10.3.4.4, the percentages of 50% responders were higher in pediatric patients (&lt;18 years of age) (Week 12: 76.6%, Week 24:79.8%) than in adult patients (18 years to&lt;65 years of age) (Week 12:60.9%, Week 24:64.1%).

## Assessor's comment

The retention rate remained high (&gt;85%) throughout the 24-week observation period. The percentage of 50% responders (i.e., ≥50% reductions in POS frequency from baseline) was high and remained stable throughout the study, with 79.8% at Week 24. More than half of the paediatric patients who completed the 24-week Observation Period achieved seizure freedom from Baseline to week 24 (55.9%).

As stated in the SmPC section 5.1, the efficacy of lacosamide in children aged 2 years and older has been extrapolated from data of adolescents and adults with partial-onset seizures. Overall, the proportion of subjects with at least a 50 % reduction in partial-onset seizure frequency per 28 days from baseline to the maintenance period was 52.9 % in the lacosamide group compared with 33.3 % in the placebo group. Therefore, the responder rate in the current Chinese surveillance study does not seem unrealistic.

## Other health outcomes

## Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC)

At the Termination Visit, treating physicians completed the CGIC for 415 pediatric patients (Table 2-9). Among the 415 pediatric patients with a completed CGIC at the Termination Visit, 42.7% of patients were considered by the treating physician to have very much improved, 34.0% of patients to have much improved, 15.2% of patients to have minimally improved, and 7.5% of patients to have no change. The remaining 3 pediatric patients (0.7%) were considered by the treating physician to have minimally worsened. No patients were considered by the treating physician to have been much worse or very much worse.

At the Early Termination Visit, treating physicians completed the CGIC for 54 pediatric patients. Among the 54 pediatric patients with a completed CGIC at the Early Termination Visit, 38.9% of patients were considered by the treating physician to have no change, 29.6% of patients to have minimally improved, 20.4% of patients to have much improved, and 9.3% of patients to have very much improved. One pediatric patient (1.9%) was considered by the treating physician to have been much worse. No patients were considered by the treating physician to have been minimally worse or very much worse.

## Pediatric Quality of Life inventory (PedsQL)

The PedsQL appropriate for each patient's age was completed; however, patients turning 18 years of age during the study continued with the form for pediatric patients ≥13 years to &lt;18 years of age.

At Baseline, the PedsQL total score for self-reported (all age groups combined, except toddlers 2 to 4 years of age) and parent-reported were high. Overall, the mean observed PedsQL total score remained high with small numerical [median (Q1, Q3)] increases seen during the 24-week Observation Period.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The MAH states that overall, based on the acceptable safety profile and evidence of effectiveness for pediatric Chinese patients in EP0144, the results from this study, in a real-world setting, support the use of VIMPAT (LCM) for the treatment of POS in pediatric patients ≥4 years to &lt;18 years of age. The differences observed between the incidences of TEAEs and percentages of 50% responders in pediatric patients compared with adult patients were not unexpected for these populations. No new significant safety information was identified in the Chinese pediatric patient population in EP0144. The safety profile was in line with previous VIMPAT (LCM) studies and consistent with the description provided in the product label. Therefore, the benefit-risk ratio remains favourable.

The results of EP0144 are being submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 (The Paediatric Regulation). No changes to the approved EU Summary of Product Information for VIMPAT are being proposed following the completion of EP0144.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The safety and tolerability profile of VIMPAT (LCM) was studied in 487 patients aged ≥4 years to &lt;18 years with partial-onset seizure (POS) under routine clinical practice in China. The results of the postmarketing surveillance study were determined to be consistent with the overall established safety profile of lacosamide. No new safety concerns were identified in these paediatric patients. The benefit risk ratio remains unchanged.

The obligation to submit the paediatric data collected in study EP0144 in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 (The Paediatric Regulation) is fulfilled. No changes to the approved EU Summary of Product Information for VIMPAT are being proposed following the completion of EP0144.

## Fulfilled:

No regulatory action required.
