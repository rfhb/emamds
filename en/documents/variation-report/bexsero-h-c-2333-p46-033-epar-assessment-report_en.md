## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The main purpose of this phase IIIB clinical study was to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the Menace vaccine when administered as a booster in healthy adolescents and young adults, previously primed with a MenACWY vaccine.

Study Identifier: MENABCWY-019

EudraCT number: 2019-004982-42

Study number: 213171

Study report title: A phase IIIB, randomized, controlled, observer-blind study to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK's) meningococcal ABCWY vaccine when administered in healthy adolescents and adults, previously primed with meningococcal ACWY vaccine.

Brief licensing history: Bexsero contains 3 recombinant proteins [factor H binding protein (fHbp), Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), and Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA)], combined with Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMV) components from the New Zealand outbreak strain NZ98/254.

In January 2013, a centralized marketing authorization in European Union (EU) was granted for Bexsero for use in individuals from 2 months of age and older. The vaccine is currently approved in 52 countries worldwide and is indicated for active immunization of individuals from 2 months of age and older against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group B with some differences in the age indication depending on the country where the vaccine is registered.

The 213171 (MENABCWY-019) study report is being submitted to comply with the requirements of Article 46 of the pediatric regulation 1901/2006.

The study has not been conducted according to an agreed pediatric investigation plan (PIP) for Bexsero.

Context of the study: Study 213171 (MENABCWY-019) evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of the MenABCWY vaccine when administered as a booster in healthy adolescents and young adults, 15 through 25 years of age, previously primed with a MenACWY vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In this study, currently licensed Menveo (MenACWY) vaccine was used as comparator. To let the participants in the ACWY group receive 2 doses of Bexsero vaccine in line with Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations, the participants in this group received Bexsero vaccine on Visit 3 (Day 181) and Visit 4 (Day 211). There were no study objectives related to the Bexsero vaccine, as it was administered only to ensure standard of care.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Study Design

This multi-center, observer-blind study was conducted at 65 centers in 4 countries (Argentina, Australia, Canada, United States [US]). A total of 1250 healthy, 15 to 25-year-old, adolescents and adults who are previously primed with meningococcal ACWY vaccine were enrolled in the study. A total of 1083 participants completed the study. The study participants were randomized into 2 study groups (1:1 ratio) to receive injections as described below:

- ABCWY: 2 doses of the MenABCWY vaccine at Day 1 and Day 181 (0, 6-months schedule) and 1 dose of placebo at Day 211.
- ACWY: 1 dose of MenACWY vaccine at Day 1 (single dose) and 2 doses of MenB vaccine at Day 181 and Day 211.

ACWY = Menveo; BS = blood sample; ESFU = extended safety follow-up; MenB = Bexsero; N = number of participants; T = telephone contact; V = visit

Insufficient blood volume may lead to test cancellation and jeopardize the statistical power. Hence, every effort must be made to collect blood volume as per protocol requirements.

b Bexsero is given for compliance with standard of care.

Note: The subjects number displayed in the figure are planned numbers.

## Statistical Methods

A sensitivity analysis for each co-primary immunogenicity objective was conducted. A logistic regression with vaccine group as a factor and country as a stratum to account for randomization was fitted using PROC PLM. The predicted proportion of responders with 4-fold rise for each vaccine group were obtained from the SAS procedure PROC PLM. The percentage differences for the predicted proportions between the vaccine groups were obtained using the SAS procedure PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC. The associated 95% CI for the difference in predicted proportions were obtained using Newcombe's method within the SAS procedure PROC FREQ.

Table 3 below summarizes participant disposition for the Enrolled Set and the reasons for study discontinuation. A total of 1250 participants were enrolled in the study. Overall, 1247 (99.8%) participants received at least one dose of study vaccine. Of these, a total of 1208 (96.6%) participants were included in the full analysis set (FAS), from which a total of 274 (43.8%) participants were included in the per protocol set (PPS) for Family 1 and 1130 (90.4%) participants were included in the PPS for Family 2. Family 1 subset is comprised of ABCWY participants, only. The most common reason for elimination from PPS for Family 1 subset was lack of immunogenicity results (24.7%) and for Family 2 subset the most common reason for elimination from subset was protocol deviations (2.6%). A total of 1247 (99.8%) participants were included in the Overall Safety Set. A total of 3 participants in the ACWY group did not receive at least 1 dose of study intervention and were eliminated from the Exposed Set.

Standardized asymptotic 95% confidence intervals between group differences are derived using Mietinen and Numinen method.

Exact confidence intervals are based on Clopper-Pearson method.

* Non-inferiority of the MenABCWY vaccine, compared to MenACWY vaccine, is met when lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI is above -10%.

For participants with a baseline titer less than LOD, a four-fold increase is relative to LOD. For participants with a baseline titer greater than or equal to LOD but less than LLOQ, a four-fold increase is relative to LLOQ.

## Examination of Subgroups

## Subgroup Analysis: MenABCWY vs. MenACWY (Family 1)

Percentages of participants with 4-fold rise in hSBA titers against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y were comparable within each subgroup analysis.

## Subgroup Analysis: MenABCWY vs. MenACWY (Family 2)

Percentages of participants with 4-fold rise in hSBA titers against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y were comparable within each subgroup analysis.

## MAH Immunogenicity Conclusions

- Primary objectives were met as non-inferiority was demonstrated following both first and second dose of MenABCWY administered in a 0,6-month schedule, compared to a single dose of MenACWY in participants previously primed with MenACWY.
- The MenABCWY vaccine induced a robust immune response as shown by GMTs percentages with participants with hSBA titers ≥LLOQ, and the percentages with participants achieving 4fold rise of hSBA titers against serogroups A, C, W, and Y after first and second dose, and each serogroup B indicator strains after the second dose.

## Safety results

## Solicited Events

## Systemic Events

- After each vaccination with MenABCWY in the ABCWY group, fatigue and headache were the most commonly reported solicited systemic events. Fatigue was reported by 40.1% and 33.1% after vaccination 1 and vaccination 2, respectively, and headache was reported in 41.0% and 33.1% of participants after vaccination 1 and vaccination 2, respectively. Severe fatigue was reported in 1.2% and 2.4% of participants after MenABCWY vaccination 1 and vaccination 2, respectively. Severe headache was reported in 1.2% and 1.4% of participants after MenABCWY vaccination 1 and vaccination 2, respectively.
- Fatigue and headache were also the most common solicited systemic events reported after vaccination 1 in the ACWY group. Fatigue was reported by 37.0% of participants, and headache was reported by 34.6% of participants. Severe fatigue was reported by 0.5% of participants, and severe headache was reported by 0.7% of participants, after vaccination 1.
- Most of the other solicited systemic events were mild to moderate in intensity. Severe solicited systemic events were reported in ≤2.9% of participants across study groups.
- Fever (defined as body temperature ≥38.0°C) was reported by 2.0% and 1.8% of participants in the ABCWY group after vaccination 1 and vaccination 2, respectively, and by 1.2% of participants in ACWY group after vaccination 1. Severe fever (defined as body temperature ≥40.0°C) was reported by 0.2% and 0.4% of participants after vaccination 1 and vaccination 2, respectively, in the ABCWY group and by 0.2% of participants in the ACWY group after both vaccination 1 and vaccination 2.

## Other Indicators of Reactogenicity

- The first onset of solicited events in majority of participants was reported from Day 1 through Day 3 following any vaccination, across study groups and the mean duration was less than 4 days for any solicited administration site or systemic event.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Within 7 days following any vaccination, prophylactic analgesic/antipyretic medications were taken by 24.3% of participants in ABCWY group, and 13.5% of participants in ACWY group. Analgesic/antipyretics were taken for treatment of pain or fever after any vaccination by 35.8% of participants in ABCWY group and 24.2% of participants in ACWY group. Most of the medication for these indications were taken from Day 1 through Day 3 following each vaccination, within the 7-day follow-up period. Table 12 below illustrates the local and systemic events Day 1-7 after each vaccination.

## Unsolicited Adverse Events

During the 30-day post-vaccination period following any vaccination (Table 14):

- At least one unsolicited AE was reported by 24.0% and 24.2% of participants in the ABCWY and ACWY groups, respectively, after any vaccination. Unsolicited AEs assessed as causally related to vaccination by the investigator were reported by 2.9% and 5.0% of participants in the ABCWY and ACWY groups, respectively. At least one unsolicited SAE was reported by 0.6% of participants in the ABCWY group and 0.2% of participants in the ACWY group. At least one unsolicited adverse event leading to premature withdrawal from the study was reported by 0.3% and 0.5% of participants in the ABCWY and ACWY groups, respectively.
- The most commonly reported unsolicited AEs were classified under the SOC Infections and Infestations (9.9% and 9.3% of participants across the study groups, respectively). The most commonly reported unsolicited AEs in the ABCWY group, by PT, were COVID-19 (reported by 3.5% of participants) and headache (reported by 1.8% of participants). The most commonly reported unsolicited AEs in the ACWY group, by PT, were COVID-19 (reported by 3.1% of participants) and oropharyngeal pain (1.6% of participants).
- Most of the unsolicited AEs were mild to moderate in intensity and resolved before the end of the study.
- Unsolicited AEs assessed as related to vaccination by investigator within first 30 days following each vaccination were reported by 2.2% and 2.1% of participants in ABCWY and ACWY groups, respectively. The most commonly reported causally related unsolicited AEs, by PT, were lymphadenopathy, dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and myalgia. The majority of the AEs that were considered related to vaccination by the investigator happened within the first 7 days.

## Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, Discontinuations due to Adverse Events, and Other Clinically Relevant Adverse Events

## Deaths

An unsolicited AE leading to death (completed suicide) was reported for 1 participant in each vaccine group. Both deaths were assessed as not causally related to the study vaccinations by the investigator.

## Other Serious Adverse Events

Overall, there were 25 (2.0%) SAEs reported during the entire study with Infections and Infestations (0.6%) and Psychiatric Disorders (0.6%) with the most reports.

There were 4 SAEs (pilonidal disease; suicidal ideation; vomiting; wolf-parkinson-white syndrome) reported in the ABCWY group with onset within 30 days of vaccination 1 (none in the ACWY group); for vaccination 2, there was 1 SAE in the ACWY group within 30 days of vaccination (none in ABCWY group). No SAEs were assessed as causally related to the study vaccinations by the investigator.

## Discontinuations Due to Adverse Events

During the entire study period, 6 participants were reported to have unsolicited AE leading to discontinuation or delay in study vaccination (2 participants in ABCWY group and 4 participants in ACWY group) and 1 of the unsolicited AEs (diarrhea) in the ACWY group was assessed by the investigator as causally related to study vaccination.

AE = Adverse event. MedDRA = Medical dictionary for regulatory activities. N = Number of participants in each vaccine group. ABCWY= Participants received 2 doses of MenABcWY vaccine at Months 0 and 6 and 1 dose of Placebo at Month 7. ACWY = Participants received 1 dose of MenAcWY vaccine at Month 0 and two doses of MenB at Months 6 and 7.

Participants with events in more than one pzeferred term are counted once in each of those preferred terms.

Number (e) of participants with unsolicited AEs, sorted by international order for system organ class and alphabetically for preferred term. Participants with multiple events in the same preferred term are counted only once in that preferred term.

Includes AEs with an onset date on or after the date of first vaccine only (i.e. not including those AEs after infoxmed consent but before first vaccination).

Note: Solicited events starting more than 7 days after the vaccination will also be considered ss unsolicited AEs. MedDRA version 26.0

Events that occur after 30 days post vaccination that are not medically attended and are not serious adverse events are not included in this sunmary.

## Adverse Events of Special Interest

During the entire study, there were 4 AESIs (celiac disease, colitis ulcerative, Crohn's disease, and arthritis) reported in the ACWY group. Of these 4 AESIs, three (celiac's disease, Crohn's disease, and arthritis) were pre-existing chronic conditions and 1 new onset AESI of colitis ulcerative, which was reported within 30 days following the second vaccination. All were assessed as non-serious and none were causally related to study intervention as assessed by the investigator. There were no AESIs reported within 7 days of any vaccination.

## Other Adverse Events

There were 5 pregnancies reported during this study. Three pregnancies were reported in the ABCWY group (1 spontaneous abortion and 2 were lost to follow-up) and 2 in the ACWY group (2 live births, 1 with congenital anomaly).

During the entire study, at least one unsolicited AE leading to a medically attended visit was reported by 35.6% and 33.2% of participants in the ABCWY and ACWY groups, respectively. The most commonly reported medically attended AEs were Infections and Infestations (17.7% and 17.9% of participants in each vaccine group) with COVID-19, anxiety, influenza, upper respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection being the most common PTs reported.

## MAH Discussion

The MenABCWY vaccine study was a phase IIIB, randomized controlled, observer-blind study designed to demonstrate immunogenicity and safety when administered in healthy adolescents and adults, previously primed with MenACWY vaccine.

Overall, 1250 participants were enrolled in the study. Demographics were comparable across groups. A total of 58.5% of the enrolled participants were from centers in the US.

Protocol deviations were similar across study groups. A total of 96.6% of the Exposed Set were included in the FAS and 90.4% of participants from FAS were included in PPS at Visit 2, and 21.9% of participants in the ABCWY group were included in the PPS at Visit 4.

After the first and second vaccination, the co-primary immunological endpoints of non-inferiority of MenABCWY vaccine compared with MenACWY vaccine against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y given to healthy participants previously primed with MenACWY were demonstrated as the LL of the 2-sided 95% CI for the group differences in overall percentages for participants achieving a 4-fold rise in hSBA titers were above the pre-defined criterion of -10%.

Overall, a robust immune response was induced against each and all serogroup B indicator strains and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

against serogroups A, C, W, and Y after vaccination with MenABCWY vaccine.

The MenABCWY vaccine was well-tolerated when given as 2-dose schedule in previously MenACWYprimed individuals.

As previously observed in other studies, reactogenicity was higher after MenABCWY compared to MenACWY, and is consistent with the one generally observed with Bexsero.

Pain, fatigue, and headache most commonly reported solicited events, and in similar rates of unsolicited AEs across both groups.

Subsequent dose of MenABCWY did not result in increase in AE reporting. None of the reported SAEs were considered related.

## MAH Overall Conclusions

- Primary objectives were met as non-inferiority was demonstrated following both second and first dose of ABCWY administered in a 0,6-month schedule, compared to a single dose of MenACWY in participants previously primed with MenACWY.
- The MenABCWY vaccine induced a robust immune response against serogroups A, C, W and Y after first and second dose, and against each serogroup B indicator strains following the second dose.
- The MenABCWY vaccine was well-tolerated in the study with a favorable safety profile when administered in a 0,6-month schedule to participants previously primed with MenACWY.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Bexsero was authorized by EMA in 2013 for use in individuals from 2 months of age and older against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group B.

Study MENABCWY-019, study number 213171 is a phase IIIB, randomized, controlled, observer-blind study to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of the meningococcal ABCWY vaccine (n=626) and ACWY group (n=624) when administered to healthy adolescents and young adults 15-25 years of age (median 16 years), previously primed with meningococcal ACWY vaccine 'Menveo'. The study was executed in Argentina, Australia, Canada and US.

The subjects were randomized to either ABCWY group (2 doses at D1 and D181, and placebo at D211) or ACWY group (1 dose MenACWY 'Menveo' at D1 and 2 doses MenB 'Bexsero' vaccine at D 181 and 211). The first dose was administered to &gt;99% of the participants and 1101 (88%) received the full vaccination course, the study was completed by 1083 (87%) of the participants. The most common reason for discontinuing the study was withdrawal by participant (4%). The most common deviation leading to elimination were visit schedule criteria (11%).

## Efficacy:

The non-inferiority criteria were met when for 2-dose MenABCWY vs 1-dose MenACWY (Menveo) in subjects previously primed with a single dose Menveo, against N.meningitidis serogropus A,C, W and Y, which was the primary endpoint.

One secondary endpoint evaluated the immune response against serogroups A, C, W and Y, for which the hSBA titers ≥LLOQ ranged from 97.9% to 98.9% and from 99.5% to 100% for MenABCWY group at 1 month after first vaccination and last vaccination, respectively. For the ACWY group, the percentages ranged from 96.8% to 99% 1 month after vaccination.

Another secondary endpoint evaluated the immune response against N. meningitidis serogroup B indicator strains, where the percentages of participants in the ABCWY group with hSBA titers ≥LLOQ ranged from 2.7% to 20.2% at baseline, and 75.6% to 96.3% one month after the last vaccination in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the ABCWY group. The percentages of participants in the ABCWY group with hSBA titers ≥LLOQ for all serogroup B indicator strains (composite response) were 1.1%, and 72.0% at baseline, and Month 7, respectively. A 4-fold rise in hSBA titers against each serogroup B indicator strain ranged from 45.7% to 90.1% in the ABCWY group at Month 7. The hSBA GMTs against each serogroup B indicator strain were low at baseline and increased following each vaccination.

## Safety:

After the first vaccination any solicited event was reported in 85% of the participants receiving ABCWY and among 23% of the participants receiving ACWY 'Menveo'. After the 2 nd  vaccination the frequency was 71% in the ABCWY group and 77% in the ACWY 'Bexsero' group. Pain at injection site was the most frequent reported local reaction, reported at a frequency of 74-80% among the subjects that received ABCWY. The frequency in the ACWY group was 32% (Menveo) and 79% (Bexsero). In the ABCWY group fatigue (40% dose 1; 33% dose 2), headache (41% dose 1; 33% dose 2) and myalgia (15% dose 1; 13% dose 2) was the most reported systemic events. Fever was reported by 2% of the subjects after each dose of ABCWY. In the ACWY group fatigue was reported at 37% (Menveo) and 36% (Bexsero); headache 35%(Menveo) and 33%(Bexsero); myalgia 11% (Menveo) and 12% (Bexsero). Fever was reported at 1% (Menveo) and 2% (Bexsero) in the ACWY group.

Unsolicited events were reported by 24% of the subjects in both study groups. Unsolicited AEs considered related to vaccination was reported by 2% in each vaccine group, of which lymphadenopathy, dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and myalgia were the most commonly reported in the ACWY group. Lymphadenopathy and myalgia are already included in the product information of Bexsero, whereas dizziness, abdominal pain and diarrhoea are not described in section 4.8 of the SmPC. It is noted that the comparator vaccine has implemented dizziness in the SmPC. Even though the numbers are low, the MAH is asked to evaluate a possible association with Bexsero and dizziness, abdominal pain and diarrhoea in the next PSUR or upcoming type II variation. In addition, since fatigue was the most commonly reported systemic event in the ACWY group and not included in the SmPC, fatigue should also be taken into account in next PSUR or upcoming type II variation.

One event of suicide was reported in each study group. In the ABCWY group there were 4 SAEs reported after the 1 st  dose and none after the 2 nd  dose. Whereas in the ACWY group there was no SAE reported after dose 1 and one SAE after dose 2. None of the SAEs were considered related to vaccination. Four participants in the ACWY group discontinued the study due to AEs of which one (diarrhoea) was considered related to vaccination. In the ACWY groups there were 4 AESIs (celiac disease, colitis ulcerative, Crohn's disease, and arthritis) reported during the study, none of them were considered related to vaccination and all of them were non-serious.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

In this phase IIIB study, non-inferiority was demonstrated following both second and first dose of ABCWY administered 6 months in between, compared to a single dose of MenACWY in subjects previously primed with MenACWY. The safety profile was in line with previous data for ACWY vaccines, except for fatigue, dizziness, abdominal pain and diarrhoea that were three of the most commonly reported unsolicited related events which are not included in the SmPC for Bexsero. Even though there are low numbers of subjects that reported these events, the MAH is requested to evaluate and address this in the next PSUR or type II variation, and if relevant also update the SmPC accordingly.

## Fulfilled:

No further action required within this procedure; however, the MAH is requested to evaluate possible association with vaccination and dizziness, abdominal pain and diarrhoea in next PSUR or type II variation.
