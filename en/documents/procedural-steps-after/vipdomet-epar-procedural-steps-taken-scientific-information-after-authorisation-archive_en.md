|           | The WSA proposed the update of sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC and in order to reflect the results of study 402, a phase 3b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven study, designed to demonstrate that no excess risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) exists following treatment with alogliptin compared with placebo when added to standard of care in adults with type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The MAH took this opportunity to propose amendments to the RMP in order to reflect results from study 402 and to update its structure according to the new European Union (EU) template for RMPs.

The primary endpoint of the study was achieved, demonstrating non-inferiority of alogliptin compared with placebo for the primary MACE composite. Therefore, in general, alogliptin was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.   |
