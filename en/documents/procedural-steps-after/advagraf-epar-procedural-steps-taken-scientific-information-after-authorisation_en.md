| 1234/2008. A grouped application consisting of: Type II (C.I.13): Submission of the final report from study F506-PV-0001 (EUPAS37025) listed as a category 3 study in the RMP for Advagraf and Modigraf. This is a non-interventional post- authorization safety study (NI-PASS) of outcomes associated with the use of tacrolimus around conception, or during pregnancy or lactation using data from Transplant Pregnancy Registry International (TPRI). The RMP version 5.2 has also been approved. In addition, section 4.6 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect the results of the study. The package leaflet is updated accordingly. Type IB (C.I.11.z): To include the feasibility assessment of using alternative secondary-use data sources to replicate the Transplant Pregnancy Registry International (TPRI) study as a category 3 additional pharmacovigilance activity in the RMP, including the milestones for the progress report and the final report of the feasibility assessment, related to EMEA/H/C/000712/MEA/032 and EMEA/H/C/000954/MEA/024. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority C.I.11.z - Introduction of, or change(s) to, the   | tacrolimus exposure), study results did not indicate an increased risk of major malformations. A higher prevalence of spontaneous abortion was observed among women treated with tacrolimus compared with alternative immunosuppressants. Among kidney transplant patients there was also a higher prevalence of pre-eclampsia in women treated with tacrolimus. However, overall, there were insufficient evidence to conclude on the risk of these outcomes. Among kidney and liver transplant patients exposed to tacrolimus, 45%-55% of their livebirths were premature, with 75%-85% having a normal birth weight for gestational age. Similar results were observed for other immunosuppressants, although conclusions were hindered by limited evidence. For more information, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.   |

As consequence of the addition of QT prolongation/TdP in section 4.4 an update for recommendation to monitor QT prolongation with ECG is introduced in section 4.5 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet is adequately amended in the corresponding sections. The MAH takes the occasion to do some minor editorial corrections in the SmPC and to update the list of local representatives for Advagraf (Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Italy, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden and introduction of Croatia) and for Modigraf (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Cyprus and introduction of Croatia). Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template Versions 8.3 and 9 C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-   |            |     | Product Information document has been updated to include warnings about this possible event. Analysis of the MAH's Safety Database, literature and external database (FDA and WHO) retrieved cases of QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes in patients using tacrolimus. Even though only suspected correlation of these events has been possible in connection with tacrolimus, patients using the drug are usually under concomitant treatments or at risk of conditions triggering the QT prolongation and the possible torsade de pointes. Therefore the warning about these possible events in patients using Tacrolimus has been further implemented in the Product Information.   |

| WS/0305       | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of SmPC sections 4.4., 4.5 and PL section 2 regarding interactions with protease inhibitors and amiodarone. The MAH also took the opportunity to perform minor editorial corrections in the SmPC and amend the list of local representatives in the PL.                                                                                                | 17/01/2013   | 18/02/2013 | SmPC and PL | A cumulative search of the literature and of the company global safety data for tacrolimus has shown that concomitant use of tacrolimus with protein inhibitors or amiodarone results in an increase of its levels. The mechanism related to this interaction is mainly reported to be due to an inhibition of CYP3A4 enzyme which is involved in the metabolism of tacrolimus and is inhibited by either the protease inhibitors or amiodarone. Therefore, the current warning related to the use of tacrolimus together with drugs capable of reducing CYP3A4 activity is amended. |

| II/0022 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC regarding agranulocytosis and haemolytic anaemia. The PIL is updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 20/10/2011 | 22/11/2011 | SmPC and PL | Review of the available data in the safety database of the MAH concluded that cases of agranulocytosis and haemolytic anaemia have been reported in association with use of tacrolimus. Regarding agranulocytosis, 36 cases were identified as of October 2010, of which four and 17 were classified as 'Index' and 'Informative', respectively. The reported index and informative cases suggest a causative relationship between administration of systemic tacrolimus and agranulocytosis. Regarding haemolytic anaemia, 67 cases were identified as of October 2010, of which one and 21 cases case were classified as 'Index' and 'Informative', respectively. Based on these cases a possible causative relationship between administration of systemic tacrolimus and haemolytic anaemia is suggested. The two identified adverse reactions were included in the SmPC and the PIL and the benefit-risk balance of the product remains positive. |

Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in section 6 of the PIL. This application was submitted for a group of variations consisting of a Type II variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   |            |     | the number of cases are limited, and many of the 27 reported \"informative cases\" of PRCA are confounded by factors such as co-administration of other medication, evidence of parvovirus B19 infection or the presence or history of thymoma/myasthenia gravis, the available data strongly suggests a causative association between exposure to tacrolimus and the development of PRCA. Therefore, a warning statement has been included in the SmPC of all three systemic tacrolimus products (Advagraf, Modigraf, Prograf) and the PRCA has been added as an adverse reaction in the section \"Undesirable effects\".   |

| II/0009 | Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC to include warnings on medication errors between Advagraf and Prograf, as requested by the CHMP in November 2008. Section 3 of the PL was updated accordingly. An updated version of the RMP has been submitted to address this issue. Consequently, the Annex II was updated to include the statement on RMP reflecting the updated version. The MAH also took the opportunity to update the contact details of some local representatives in the PL. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 19/02/2009 | 25/03/2009 | SmPC, Annex II and PL  | Up to 14 November 2008, 50 cases of medication errors have been reported involving confusion between Advagraf (prolonged release formulation of tacrolimus to be taken once daily) and Prograf (immediate release formulation of tacrolimus to be taken twice daily). Thirty-seven (37) of these cases were reported in the UK and 37 were dispensing errors. In 22 cases, the patient did not take the wrong medicinal product or did not follow the wrong regimen. Of the 28/50 patients who were administered the incorrect formulation or dosage regimen, 9 experienced at least one adverse event (14 adverse events were reported in total). Of these, 4 were serious adverse events, including graft rejection or reduced graft function. Therefore warnings have been included in the product information to prevent inadvertent, unintentional or unsupervised switching of immediate- or prolonged release formulations |

| II/0008 | Update of section 5.1 of the SPC to include the results from phase III clinical studies performed with Advagraf, as requested by the CHMP in July 2008. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics | 22/01/2009 | 25/02/2009 | SmPC | The efficacy and safety of Advagraf and Prograf, both in combination with corticosteroids, was compared in 471 de novo liver transplant recipients. The event rate of biopsy confirmed acute rejection within the first 24 weeks after transplantation was 32.6% in the Advagraf group and 29.3% in the Prograf group. The 12 month patient survival rates were 89.2% for Advagraf and 90.8% for Prograf. In the Advagraf arm 25 patients died (14 female, 11 male) and in the Prograf arm 24 patients died (5 female, 19 male). The 12-month graft survival was 85.3% for Advagraf and 85.6% for Prograf. In a second clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of Advagraf and Prograf, both in combination with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids in 667 de novo kidney transplant recipients, the event rate for biopsy- confirmed acute rejection within the first 24 weeks after transplantation was 18.6% in the Advagraf group and 14.9% in the Prograf group. The 12 month patient survival rates were 96.9% for Advagraf and 97.5% for Prograf. In the Advagraf arm 10 patients died (3 female, 7 male) and in the Prograf arm 8 patients died (3 female, 5 male). The 12-month graft survival was 91.5% for Advagraf and 92.8% for Prograf. For the sake of completeness, data from a third clinical trial in renal transplantation submitted and evaluated for the initial approval of Advagraf have also now been included in section 5.1. |

| II/0007   | Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC and section 4 of the PL to implement the warning on BK virus associated nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) requested by the CHMP in July 2008.

These infections are often related to a high total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions. Thus physicians should consider BKVN and PML in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with deteriorating renal function or neurological symptoms. |
| II/0005   | Update of section 4.4 of the SPC to include information on posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) as requested by the CHMP following assessment of the first PSUR (covering the period 01.04.07 - 30.09.07). The MAH took the opportunity of this variation to update section 9 of the Labelling in line with the EMEA/QRD template (version 7.2) and to correct minor spelling mistakes in the SPC and PL. In addition, the contact details of some local representatives have been updated in the PL. The MAH also took the opportunity of this variation to make linguistic corrections to the SPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL, as relevant, for Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, | 25/09/2008   | 28/10/2008 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | A cumulative review of the MAH's safety database up to 28 May 2008 identified 32 cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). In the majority of the 32 cases the patients recovered after discontinuation of tacrolimus. Given that PRES can be definitely diagnosed with neuro-imaging techniques, is reversible if treated, and potentially fatal if not, a warning has been included in the SPC to make physicians aware of this condition.                                                   |
