## ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Ervebo solution for injection Ebola Zaire Vaccine (rVSV∆G -ZEBOV-GP, live)

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

One dose (1 mL) contains:

Ebola Zaire Vaccine (rVSV∆G -ZEBOV-GP 1,2  live, attenuated) ≥ 72 million pf u 3 1 Recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (rVSV) strain Indiana with a deletion of the VSV envelope glycoprotein (G) replaced with the Zaire Ebola Virus (ZEBOV) Kikwit 1995 strain surf ace glycoprotein (GP) 2 Produced in Vero cells 3 pfu=plaque-forming units

This product contains genetically modified organisms (GMOs). This vaccine contains a trace amount of rice protein. See section 4.3.

For the full list of  excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Solution for injection.

The solution is a colourless to slightly brownish-yellow liquid.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Ervebo is indicated for active immunisation of individuals 1 year of age or older to protect against Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) caused by Zaire Ebola virus (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).

The use of Ervebo should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Ervebo should be administered by a trained healthcare worker.

Posology

Individuals 1 year of age or older: one dose (1 mL) (see section 5.1).

## Booster dose

The need and appropriate timing for booster dose(s) have not been established. Current available data are included in section 5.1.

Paediatric population

The posology in children 1 to 17 years of age is the same as in adults (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Ervebo should not be used in children aged less than 1 year of age because the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy have not been established (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).

## Method of administration

For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4.

For precautions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6.

Ervebo should be administered by the intramuscular route. The preferred site is the deltoid area of the non-dominant arm or in the higher anterolateral area of the thigh.  The vaccine should not be injected intravascularly. No data are available for administration via the subcutaneous or intradermal routes.

The vaccination injection site or any vesicles must be covered with an adequate bandage (e.g. any adhesive bandage or gauze and tape). This provides a physical barrier to protect against direct contact (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). The bandage may be removed when there is no visible fluid leakage.

The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to rice protein listed in section 2.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

It is recommended to closely monitor vaccinees following vaccination for the early signs of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.

## Duration of protection

Vaccination with Ervebo may not result in protection in all vaccinees. Vaccine efficacy in adults has been established in the period ≥10 to ≤ 31 days after vaccination, however the duration of protection is not known (see section 5.1). The use of other Ebola control measures should therefore not be interrupted .

Vaccination of contacts of Ebola cases should occur as soon as possible (see section 5.1).

## Standard precautions when caring for patients with known or suspected Ebola disease

Vaccination with Ervebo does not eliminate the necessity of standard precautions when caring for patients with known or suspected Ebola disease. All healthcare workers and other ancillary providers who have been vaccinated should not alter their practices with regard to safe injection, hygiene, and personal protective equipment (PPE) after vaccination.

Healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the pat ient's blood and body f luids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. Samples taken from humans and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

animals for investigation of  Ebola inf ection should be handled by trained staf f and processed in suitably equipped laboratories.

Vaccine administrators should counsel vaccinees to continue to protect themselves with adequate measures.

## Immunocompromised individuals

Safety and efficacy of Ervebo have not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals. Immunocompromised individuals may not respond as well as immunocompetent individuals to Ervebo. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Ervebo in individuals with known immunocompromised conditions or receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including the following conditions:

- Severe humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodeficiency, e.g. severe combined immunodeficiency, agammaglobulinemia, and AIDS or symptomatic HIV infection. A CD4+ T -lymphocyte count threshold for use in asymptomatic HIV-positive individuals has not been established.
- Current immunosuppressive therapy, including high doses of corticosteroids. This does not include individuals who are receiving topical, inhaled or low-dose parenteral corticosteroids (e.g. f or asthma prophylaxis or replacement therapy).
- Diseases of the blood such as leukaemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the haematopoietic and lymphatic systems.
- Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated.

## Pregnant and breast-feeding women

As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Ervebo during pregnancy. See section 4.6.

## Transmission

Vaccine virus might be present in biological fluids such as blood, urine, saliva, semen, vaginal fluids, aqueous humor, breast milk, faeces, sweat, amniotic fluid, and placenta. In clinical studies, vaccine virus RNA has been detected by PCR in the plasma of most of the adult participants. Vaccine virus RNA was mainly detected from Day 1 to Day 7. Shedding of vaccine virus has been detected by PCR in urine or saliva in 19 out of 299 adult participants and in skin vesicles in 4 out of 10 adult participants. The vaccine virus RNA was detected in a skin vesicle at 12 days post-vaccination in one of the f our participants.

In a Phase 1 study, vaccine viremia and viral shedding were observed more frequently (28/39) in children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age compared to adults. In a subsequent Phase 2 study, 31.7% (19/60) of children and adolescents 1 to 17 years of age enrolled in a shedding sub-study shed vaccine virus in saliva f ollowing vaccination. Viral shedding was observed more frequently on Day 7 and declined thereafter, with no shedding detected at Day 56.

Transmission of vaccine virus through close personal contact is accepted as a theoretical possibility. Vaccine recipients should avoid close contact with and exposure of high-risk individuals to blood and bodily fluids f or at least 6 weeks f ollowing vaccination. High-risk individuals include:

- Immunocompromised individuals and individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy (see section above),
- Pregnant or breast-feeding women (see section 4.6),
- Children &lt; 1 year of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Individuals who develop vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine should cover the vesicles until they heal to minimise the risk of  possible transmission of vaccine virus through open vesicles. Contaminated bandages must be disposed following institutional guidelines or WHO healthcare waste management policy. See section 5.3.

Parents and caregivers of young vaccinees should observe careful hygiene especially when handling bodily waste and fluids for a minimum of 6 weeks after vaccination. Disposable nappies can be sealed in double plastic bags and disposed of in household waste. See section 5.3.

Inadvertent transmission of vaccine virus to animals and livestock is also theoretically possible, see below.

Individuals administered Ervebo should not donate blood for at least 6 weeks post-vaccination.

## Transmission to animals and livestock

Transmission of vaccine virus through close contact with livestock is accepted as a theoretical possibility. Vaccine recipients should attempt to avoid exposure of livestock to blood and bodily f luids for at least 6 weeks f ollowing vaccination. Individuals who develop vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine should cover the vesicles until they heal.  Contaminated bandages must be disposed following institutional guidelines or WHO healthcare waste management policy. See section 5.3.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in individuals experiencing moderate or severe febrile illness. The presence of a minor infection should not result in deferral of vaccination.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

The vaccine should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.

## Protection against f ilovirus disease

The vaccine will not prevent disease caused by filoviruses other than Zaire Ebola virus.

## Impact to serological testing

Following vaccination with Ervebo, individuals may test positive for Ebola glycoprotein (GP) nucleic acids, antigens, or antibodies against Ebola GP, which are targets f or certain Ebola diagnostic tests. Therefore, diagnostic testing for Ebola should target non-GP sections of the Ebola virus.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ' sodium-free ' .

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## No interaction studies have been performed.

As there are no data on co-administration of Ervebo with other vaccines, the concomitant use of Ervebo with other vaccines is not recommended.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Immune globulin (IG), blood or plasma transfusions should not be given concomitantly with Ervebo. Administration of immune globulins, blood or plasma transfusions administered 3 months before or up to 1 month after Ervebo administration may interfere with the expected immune response.

It is unknown whether concurrent administration of antiviral medication including interferons could impact vaccine virus replication and efficacy.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of Ervebo in pregnant women, or women who became pregnant after receiving the vaccine. The safety of Ervebo has not been established in pregnant women.

As there are limitations to available data, including the small number of cases, caution should be exercised in drawing conclusions. Lack of reliable data on background rates of pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in the affected regions also makes a contextual assessment of the data challenging.

Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmf ul effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Ervebo during pregnancy. Nevertheless, considering the severity of EVD, vaccination should not be withheld when there is a clear risk of exposure to Ebola inf ection.

Pregnancy should be avoided for 2 months following vaccination. Women of child-bearing potential should use an effective contraceptive method.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether the vaccine virus is secreted in human milk.

A risk to the newborns/infants from breast-feeding by vaccinated mothers cannot be excluded.

Evaluation of the vaccine virus in animal milk has not been conducted. When Ervebo is administered to f emale rats, antibodies against the vaccine virus were detected in offspring, likely due to acquisition of maternal antibodies via placental transf er during gestation and via lactation. See section 5.3.

A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from Ervebo taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy f or the woman. In certain circumstances, where alternatives to breast-feeding are limited, the immediate need and health benefits to the inf ant should be taken into consideration and balanced with the mother's need f or Ervebo. Both may present compelling needs that should be considered before vaccination of the mother.

## Fertility

There are no data on fertility eff ects in humans.

Animal studies in female rats do not indicate harmful effects (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Ervebo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 'Undesirable ef f ects' may temporarily af f ect the ability  to drive or use machines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

For all age groups, anaphylaxis was reported very rarely (&lt;1/10 000) in clinical studies.

In adults 18 years of age and older, the most common injection-site adverse reactions reported following vaccination with Ervebo were injection-site pain (70.3%), injection-site swelling (16.7%) and injection-site erythema (13.7%). The most common systemic adverse reactions were headache (55.1%), pyrexia (39.2%), myalgia (32.5%), somnolence, reduced activity, f atigue (25.5%), arthralgia (18.6%), chills (16.7%), decreased appetite (15.2%), abdominal pain (13.0%), nausea (9.5%), arthritis (3.7%), rash (3.6%), hyperhidrosis (3.2%), and mouth ulceration (2.2%). In general, these reactions were reported within 7 days after vaccination, were mild to moderate in intensity, and had short duration (less than 1 week).

In children and adolescents 1 to 17 years of age, the most common injection-site adverse reactions reported following vaccination with Ervebo were injection-site pain (41.6%), injection-site pruritus (4.1%), injection-site swelling (3.0%) and injection-site erythema (0.5%). The most common systemic adverse reactions were pyrexia (62.2%), headache (45.7%), somnolence, reduced activity, fatigue (23.5%), decreased appetite (23.4%), myalgia (15.8%), dizziness (9.9%), crying (6.4%) and mouth ulceration (2.5%). In general, these reactions were reported within 7 days after vaccination and were mild to moderate in intensity.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Frequencies are reported as: Very common (≥1/10) , Common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10), Uncommon (≥1/1 000 to &lt;1/100), Rare (≥1/10 000 to &lt;1/1 000), Very rare (&lt;1/10 000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

## Individuals 1 year of age and older

Table 1 shows the adverse reactions observed in recipients of Ervebo.

For adults, the f requencies listed are based on the higher frequency reported in the Phase 2/3 placebocontrolled randomised studies, Protocol 009, Protocol 012 and Protocol 016, that have included a total of 2 143 individuals.

For children and adolescents, the frequencies listed corresponds to those observed in Protocol 016, a Phase 2 placebo-controlled randomised study, that has included a total of 609 individuals (including 95 children from 1 to 3 years old, 310 children from 3 to 11 years old, and 204 children f rom 12 to 17 years old).

§ See description of selected adverse reactions.

† Includes: somnolence, reduced activity and fatigue.

‡ NA (not applicable): not assessed for this population.

¶ The adverse reactions of abdominal pain, nausea, rash, arthralgia, chills, and hyperhidrosis occurred with a difference of &lt;5% between vaccine and placebo groups.

*The adverse reactions of dizziness and injection site pruritus occurred with a diff erence of &lt;5% between vaccine and placebo groups.

Pyrexia was reported more frequently in younger children 1 to &lt;3 years of age (83.2%), compared to children 3 to &lt;12 years of age (64.8%), adolescents 12 to 17 years of age (48.3%) and adults (39.2%). Otherwise, the safety profile of Ervebo in children and adolescents 1 to 17 years of age was generally similar to that observed in adults.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Arthralgia and arthritis

Arthralgia was generally reported in the first few days following vaccination, was mild to moderate in intensity, and resolved within one week after onset. Arthritis (arthritis, joint ef f usion, joint swelling, osteoarthritis, monoarthritis or polyarthritis) was generally reported within the first few weeks following vaccination. In clinical studies with reports of arthritis, the median onsets were between 10 and 12 days (range from 0 to 25 days). Arthritis has been reported by participants in clinical studies at a frequency that ranged from 0% in several protocols to 23.5% in one Phase 1 study. The majority of arthritis reactions were mild to moderate in severity. The median duration of arthritis across clinical studies in which arthritis was reported ranged from 2 days to 81.5 days (including duration of recurrent arthritis) with a maximum of 330 days. The reasons for differences in arthritis reporting across studies are not known but may be due to differences in study populations or outcome reporting. In the Phase 1 study with the highest rate of arthritis, 6 of  24 patients (25%) who reported arthritis after vaccination had persistent joint symptoms two years after vaccination. In a small number of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

participants, the vaccine virus was recovered from joint effusion samples, suggestive of a virally mediated process post-vaccination.

## Rash

Rash was characterised in a variety of ways including generalised rash (2.3%), vesicular rash (0.5%), dermatitis (0.3%), or cutaneous vasculitis (0.01%) in clinical studies. In dif ferent studies, rash was reported with median onsets of 7.5 to 10.5 days (range from 0 to 47 days). The median durations reported were between 6 to 18 days. In 6 out of 18 participants tested, the vaccine virus was detected in rashes (described as dermatitis, vesicles or cutaneous vasculitis lesions) suggesting a virally mediated process post-vaccination.

## Transient decrease in white blood cells

Transient decreases in counts of  lymphocytes, neutrophils and total white blood cells in the f irst 3 days following vaccination have been observed very commonly in Phase 1/2 studies; these adverse reactions generally resolved after the f irst week post-vaccination. No adverse reactions of  infections were observed in Phase 1/2 studies.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No cases of overdose have been reported. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral Vaccine, ATC code: J07BX02

## Mechanism of action

Ervebo consists of a live, attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-based vector expressing the envelope glycoprotein gene of Zaire Ebola virus (rVSV ∆ G-ZEBOV-GP). Immunisation with the vaccine results in an immune response and protection from Zaire Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). The relative contributions of  innate, humoral and cell-mediated immunity to protection from Zaire Ebola virus are unknown.

## Clinical immunogenicity and eff icacy

The clinical development program included six Phase 2/3 clinical studies (Protocols 009, 012, 016 and 018). All participants received a single dose of vaccine except for a subset of participants in Protocol 002 (n=30) and Protocol 016 (n=399) who received two doses.

## Clinical efficacy

Clinical eff icacy of  Ervebo in adults was assessed in Protocol 010.

Protocol 010 (Ring vaccination study) was a Phase 3 open-label cluster-randomised study of ring vaccination (vaccinating contacts and contacts of contacts [CCCs] of index Ebola cases) which evaluated efficacy and safety of  Ervebo in Guinea. In this study, 9 096 participants ≥ 18 years of age who were considered CCCs of an index case with laboratory-confirmed EVD were randomised to immediate (4 539 participants in 51 clusters) or 21 days delayed (4 557 participants in 47 clusters)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vaccination with Ervebo. Of those 9 096 participants, 4 160 received Ervebo (2 119 participants were vaccinated in the immediate arm and 2 041 participants were vaccinated in the delayed arm). The median age of consenting CCCs was 35 years old. The final primary analysis included 2 108 participants (51 clusters) vaccinated in the immediate arm and 1 429 participants (46 clusters) eligible and consented on Day 0 in the delayed arm.

The final primary analysis was to assess efficacy against laboratory confirmed EVD by comparing incidence of cases occurring 10 to 31 days post-randomisation for those vaccinated in the immediate vaccination rings versus incidence of cases for participants who consented on Day 0 in the delayed vaccination rings. Vaccine efficacy was 100% (unadjusted 95% CI: 63.5% to 100%; 95% CI adjusted for multiplicity: 14.4% to 100%) (0 cases in the immediate arm; 10 cases in 4 rings in the delayed arm). Randomisation was stopped after an interim analysis with a p=0.0036 that did not meet the prespecified alpha level of 0.0027. Of the 10 cases, 7 were in contacts, and 3 in contacts-of -contacts. Uncertainties remain as to the level, duration and type of protection given the methodological limitations and the exceptional circumstances experienced during the study.

## Clinical immunogenicity

No immune correlates of protection have been defined.

Protocol 009, named Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia (PREVAIL) was a Phase 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study which evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of Ebola vaccine candidates including Ervebo. This study compared Ervebo to normal saline placebo in 1 000 adults ≥18 years of  age in Liberia.

Protocol 011, named Sierra Leone Study to Introduce a Vaccine against Ebola (STRIVE) was a Phase 2/3 randomised open-label study which evaluated safety and immunogenicity of Ervebo in adults ≥ 18 years of age working in healthcare facilities or on frontline activities related to the Ebola response in Sierra Leone. In this study, 8 673 adult participants were enrolled and 8 651 with valid consents randomised to immediate (within 7 days of enrolment) or deferred (18 to 24 weeks after enrolment) vaccination with Ervebo. An immunogenicity sub-study included 508 participants who were vaccinated and provided samples for the assessment of immunogenicity.

Protocol 012 was a Phase 3 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study which evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of three consistency lots and a high dose lot (approximately five times higher than the dose in consistency lots and dose used in other Phase 2/3 studies) of Ervebo compared to normal saline placebo. A total of 1 197 healthy participants 18 to 65 years of age were enrolled in the US, Canada, and Spain.

Protocol 016, named Partnership for Research on Ebola VACcination (PREVAC), was a Phase 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study which evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of Ervebo in participants who received: a single dose of Ervebo and normal saline placebo administered 56 days apart, two doses of Ervebo administered 56 days apart, or two doses of normal saline placebo. In this study, 998 children and adolescents 1 to 17 years of age and 1 004 adults 18 years of age and older were enrolled in Guinea, Liberia, Mali and Sierra Leone.

Protocol 018 was a Phase 3 open-label study conducted in Guinea to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Ervebo in vaccinated frontline workers 18 years of age and older that was implemented as Part B of the Phase 3 ring vaccination study for Protocol 010. In this study, a total of 2 115 participants were enrolled and 2 016 participants were vaccinated with Ervebo. An immunogenicity sub-study included 1 217 participants who were vaccinated and provided samples for the assessment of immunogenicity.

Immunogenicity data were obtained in Protocol 009 in Liberia, Protocol 011 in Sierra Leone, Protocol 012 in the United States, Canada, and Europe, Protocol 016 in Guinea, Liberia, Mali, and Sierra Leone, and Protocol 018 in Guinea. Gamma irradiation of specimens (f rom regions involved in Ebola outbreaks) was performed to reduce risk of wild-type Ebola virus infection of laboratory

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

workers, but increased pre-vaccination glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (GPELISA) immune responses by approximately 20% and decreased post-vaccination GP-ELISA and plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) immune responses by approximately 20%. Samples from Protocol 012 were not gamma irradiated. Absence of gamma irradiation, lower baseline seropositivity and other factors resulted in a higher immune response in Protocol 012.

## Clinical immunogenicity in adults 18 years of age and older

Immunogenicity testing has been performed in Protocol 009, Protocol 011, Protocol 012, Protocol 016 and Protocol 018, and includes the assessment of binding immunoglobulin G (IgG) specific to purified Kikwit ZEBOV GP by validated GP-ELISA as well as validated neutralisation of vaccine virus by a PRNT.

As shown in Tables 2 and 3, the geometric mean titres (GMT) of GP-ELISA and PRNT increased from pre-vaccination to post-vaccination.

Over 93.8% of vaccine recipients from Protocols 009, 011, 012, 016 and 018 met seroresponse criteria defined as a ≥2 -fold increase f rom baseline and ≥200 EU/mL at any time post-vaccination by GPELISA and over 80.0% of participants met seroresponse criteria def ined as a ≥4 -f old increase f rom baseline at any time post-vaccination by PRNT.

## Paediatric population

## Clinical immunogenicity in children and adolescents 1 to 17 years of age

As shown in Tables 4 and 5, the GMTs of GP-ELISA and PRNT increased from pre-vaccination to post-vaccination. In Protocol 016, 95.7% of  participants met seroresponse criteria def ined as a ≥2 -f old increase f rom baseline and ≥200 EU/mL at any time post-vaccination by GP-ELISA and 95.8% of part icipants met seroresponse criteria def ined as a ≥4 -f old increase f rom baseline at any time post-vaccination by PRNT. At 12 months following vaccination, 93.2% of participants continued to meet the seroresponse criteria for GP-ELISA and 95.3% continued to meet seroresponse criteria for PRNT. Tables 4 and 5 provide a summary of GMTs for the GP-ELISA and for the PRNT, respectively, by age range.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Immune responses after vaccination with Ervebo in children and adolescents were non-inf erior to those in adults at 1 month post -vaccination. The clinical relevance of the immunogenicity data is currently not known.

Clinical immunogenicity in participants receiving a booster dose

Although an increase in antibody responses was observed in children and adolescents (n=195), and adults (n=194) after a second dose of Ervebo administered on Day 56 (Protocol 016), the increase in antibody titres was not maintained above the single dose regimen (n=386 children and adolescents, n=386 adults) at 12 months post -vaccination.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Not applicable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development.

When Ervebo was administered to female rats, antibodies against the vaccine virus were detected in foetuses and offspring, likely due to trans-placental transfer during gestation and with the acquisition of maternal antibodies during lactation, respectively (see section 4.6).

Ervebo administered to female rats had no effects on mating performance, fertility, or embryonic/foetal development.

Ervebo administered to female rats had no effects on development or behaviour of the offspring.

## Environmental risk assessment (ERA)

The vaccine virus is a Genetically Modified Organism (GMO). An ERA was conducted to determine the potential impact of this vaccine on human health and the environment. Because this vaccine is based on VSV, a known pathogen in livestock (e.g. horses, cattle, pigs), the risk assessment included species that are relevant f or the wild type (wt) VSV backbone of this vaccine.

In a biodistribution study conducted in non-human primates, vaccine virus RNA was detected in lymphoid organs up to 112 days post-vaccination. However, infectious virus was detected at Day 1 and persistent infectious virus was not detected at any subsequent timepoints measured (Days 56, 84 and 112).

Based on transient shedding data in adults and children from 1 year of age (n=5 f or children from 1 to &lt;3 years of  age), the results of a toxicity study in non-human primates, and lack of horizontal transmission in pigs, the overall risk of  Ervebo to human health and the environment is considered negligible. However, as a precaution, vaccinees and caregivers should attempt to avoid exposure of livestock to blood and bodily f luids from vaccinees f or at least 6 weeks following vaccination to avoid the theoretical risk of spread of the vaccine virus. For young vaccinees, if possible, soiled nappies can be cleaned with appropriate detergents or disinf ectants; disposable nappies can be sealed in double plastic bags and disposed of in household waste for at least 6 weeks following vaccination. People who develop vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine should cover the vesicles until they heal. The vaccination site or any vesicles must be covered with an adequate bandage (e.g., adhesive bandage or gauze and tape). This provides a physical barrier to protect against direct contact with vesicle f luid (see section 4.2). The bandage may be removed when there is no visible fluid leakage.Medical waste and other cleaning materials must  not come in contact with livestock in order to avoid unintended exposure to livestock.

See sections 4.4 and 6.6 for further information.

- The vaccine is stored f rozen at -80°C to -60°C and should be removed from the freezer and thawed in less than 4 hours until no visible ice is present. Do not thaw the vial in a refrigerator as it is not guaranteed that the vial will thaw in less than 4 hours. The thawed vial should then be gently inverted several times prior to withdrawal with the syringe.
- The vaccine should appear as a colourless to slightly brownish-yellow liquid with no particulates visible. Discard the vaccine if particulates are present.
- Withdraw the entire content of  the vaccine f rom the vial using a sterile needle and syringe.

If f easible, the waste liquid f rom eye washes should be collected and decontaminated before discarding into the drain.

Any unused vaccine or waste material should be disposed in compliance with the institutional guidelines for genetically modif ied organisms or biohazardous waste, as appropriate.

If breakage/spillage were to occur, disinfectants such as aldehydes, alcohols and detergents are proven to reduce viral infection potential af ter only a f ew minutes.

- Ebola is a serious disease caused by a virus. If  people get Ebola, it can kill them. People catch Ebola from people or animals who are infected with Ebola or who died from Ebola.
- People can catch Ebola from blood and body fluids like urine, stools, saliva, vomit, sweat, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids of people who are infected with Ebola virus.
- People can also catch Ebola from things that have touched the blood or body fluids of a person or animal with Ebola (like clothes or objects in direct contact).
- Ebola is not spread through the air, water or food.

Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will talk to you and then together you can decide if you or your child should receive this vaccine.

## 2. What you need to know before you or your child receives Ervebo

## Do not receive Ervebo if you:

- are allergic to the active substance, rice, or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6).

You should not receive Ervebo if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

This vaccine might not protect everyone who receives it and the length of time you are protected from Ebola by Ervebo is not known.

Continue to follow your doctor, pharmacist or nurse's recommendations to protect yourself from Ebola infection after you get this vaccine.

## Hand washing:

Washing your hands correctly is the most effective way to prevent the spread of dangerous germs, like Ebola virus. It reduces the number of germs on the hands and so reduces their spread from person to person.

Proper hand washing methods are described below;

- Use soap and water when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids. There is no need to use antimicrobial soaps f or washing hands.
- Use alcohol-based hand sanitiser when hands are not dirty. Do not use alcohol-based hand sanitiser when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body f luids.

## In an area affected by Ebola:

While in an area affected by Ebola, it is important to avoid the following:

- Contact with blood and body fluids (such as urine, faeces, saliva, sweat, vomit, breast milk, semen, and vaginal f luids).
- Items that may have come in contact with an inf ected person's blood or body f luids (such as clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment).
- Funeral or burial rituals that require handling the body of someone who died from Ebola.
- Contact with bats, apes and monkeys or with blood, fluids and raw meat prepared from these animals (bushmeat) or meat from an unknown source.
- Contact with semen from a man who had Ebola. You should follow safe sex practices until you know the virus is gone from the semen.

## In case of rash:

If you get a rash where the skin is broken af ter receiving Ervebo, cover it until it heals. Put the used plasters and bandages in a sealed container, if possible, and throw them in the waste bin to make sure that people with a weak immune system or animals do not come into contact with the plasters and bandages.

## Taking care of children that have received Ervebo:

For at least 6 weeks af ter children receive this vaccine, it is important that you wash your hands thoroughly after you have been in contact with blood or body fluids of vaccinated children. If possible clean soiled nappies with appropriate detergents/disinf ectants or if using disposable nappies, seal them in double plastic bag and dispose of  them in the household waste.

## Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you receive Ervebo if  you:

## Have had allergic reactions to vaccines or medicines

- If you have ever had an allergic reaction to a vaccine or medicine, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you receive this vaccine.

## Have a weak immune system

If your immune system is weak (which means your body is less able to fight off diseases), you might not be able to receive Ervebo. You might have a weak immune system if:

- you have HIV infection or AIDS,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- you are taking certain medicines that make your immune system weak such as immunosuppressants or corticosteroids,
- you have cancer or a blood problem that makes your immune system weak,
- a member of your family has a weak immune system.

If you think you might have a weak immune system, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if  you should receive this vaccine. If you do get the vaccine and have a weak immune system, the vaccine may not work as well as in people with a normal immune system.

## Are in contact with vulnerable individuals

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if in the 6 weeks after you receive Ervebo you might be in close contact with or in the same household as:

- babies who are less than 1 year old,
- someone who may be pregnant or breast-feeding,
- someone who has a weak immune system.

This is because you could pass on the virus in the vaccine to them through your body fluids.

## Plan to donate blood

- Do not donate blood for at least 6 weeks af ter you receive this vaccine.

## Are in contact with farm animals

Make sure your blood or body fluids do not come into close contact with farm animals for at least 6 weeks after you receive this vaccine. This is because of  a possibility that you could pass on the virus in the vaccine to the animals.

## Have a fever (high temperature)

- If you have a f ever (high temperature), you should talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Ervebo. The vaccination may have to be delayed until your fever is gone.
- A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem but talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Ervebo.

## Have a bleeding disorder or bruise easily

- Tell your healthcare worker if you have a problem with bleeding or you bruise easily. Ervebo might make you bleed or bruise where the vaccine is injected.

## Testing for Ebola after you receive Ervebo

- You may test positive for Ebola virus after you receive Ervebo. This does not mean that you have Ebola. Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse that you have received Ervebo. They might need to do another test.

## Children younger than 1 year of age

If your child is under 1 year old, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. There is no recommendation for use of Ervebo in children younger than 1 year of age.

## Other medicines and Ervebo

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurseif you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or vaccines.

No studies have looked at how other medicines or vaccines and Ervebo might interact with each other. Use of Ervebo with other vaccines is not recommended.

## If you plan to receive blood or blood products

Do not receive this vaccine at the same time that you get blood or blood products. Ervebo might not work as well if you get blood or blood products 3 months before or up to 1 month after vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

- If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before you receive this vaccine. They will help you decide if you should receive Ervebo.
- Do not become pregnant for 2 months after you receive Ervebo. Women who are able to become pregnant should use an effective method of birth control. It is not known if  Ervebo will harm the mother or the unborn baby. It is also not known if it can pass to the baby through breast milk.
- If you might be in close contact with, or in the same household as someone who may be pregnant or breast-f eeding during the 6 weeks af ter you receive Ervebo, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This is because you could pass the vaccine to them through your body fluids.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

Standard precautions when caring for patients with known or suspected Ebola disease

Vaccination with Ervebo does not eliminate the necessity of standard precautions when caring for patients with known or suspected Ebola disease. All healthcare workers, and other ancillary providers who have been vaccinated, should not alter their practices with regard to safe injection, hygiene, and personal protective equipment (PPE) after vaccination.

Standard precautions, as outlined by WHO, include the following:

- Basic hand hygiene
- Respiratory hygiene
- Use of PPE (to block splashes or other contact with infected materials)
- Safe injection practices
- Safe burial practices

Healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus should apply extra inf ection  control measures to prevent contact with the patient's blood and body f luids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact (within 1 metre) of patients with Ebola Virus Disease, healthcare workers should wear face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile gloves for some procedures).

Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of Ebola infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories.

Vaccine administrators should counsel vaccinees to continue to protect themselves with the following measures:

- Hand washing
- Avoid contact with blood and body fluids
- Safe burial practices
- Safe sex
- Avoid contact with bats and non-human primates or blood, fluids and raw meat prepared from these animals (bushmeat) or meat from an unknown source.

Instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Ervebo is stored frozen at -80 °C to -60 °C and should be removed from the freezer and thawed in less than 4 hours until no visible ice is present. Do not thaw the vial in a ref rigerator as it is not guaranteed that the vial will thaw in less than 4 hours. The thawed vial should then be gently inverted several times prior to withdrawal with the syringe.
- After thawing, Ervebo should be used immediately; however, in-use stability data have demonstrated that once thawed, the vaccine can be stored for up to 14 days at 2 °C to 8 °C prior to use. At the end of 14 days, the vaccine should be used or discarded. Upon removal from the freezer, the product should be marked with both the date that it was taken out of the freezer and also a new discard date [in place of the labelled expiry date (EXP)]. Once thawed, the vaccine cannot be re-frozen.
- Ervebo is a colourless to slightly brownish-yellow liquid. Discard the vaccine if particulates are present.
- Ervebo should be administered intramuscularly. Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly. No data are available for administration via the subcutaneous or intradermal routes.
- Ervebo should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.
- Withdraw the entire content of Ervebo from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe. The preferred injection site is the deltoid area of the non-dominant arm or in the higher anterolateral area of the thigh. Cover the injection site with gauze or bandage (e.g. any adhesive bandage or gauze and tape) that provides a physical barrier to protect against direct contact with vesicle fluid. The bandage may be removed when there is no visible fluid leakage.
- Any unused vaccine or waste material should be disposed of in compliance with the institutional guidelines for genetically modif ied organisms or biohazardous waste, as appropriate. If breakage/spillage were to occur, disinfectants such as aldehydes, alcohols and detergents are proven to reduce viral inf ection potential after only a few minutes. If f easible, the waste liquid from eye washes should be collected and decontaminated before discarding into the drain.
