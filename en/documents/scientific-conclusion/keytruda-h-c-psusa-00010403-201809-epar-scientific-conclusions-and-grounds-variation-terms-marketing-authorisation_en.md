## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pembrolizumab, the scientific conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:

Review of the cases reporting haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) resulted in the identification of four cases where a causal association between HLH and pembrolizumab is considered reasonably possible. Furthermore, considering the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, it could be argued that pembrolizumab, through enhancing T-cell responses and cytokine production, can lead to an uncontrolled proliferation of T lymphocytes and well-differentiated macrophages that are the cause of HLH. It is considered that a causal association between HLH and pembrolizumab exists.  As a result, section 4.8 of the Summary of Products Characteristics should be updated to add Haemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis to the list of adverse reactions with a frequency rare.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pembrolizumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pembrolizumab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.
