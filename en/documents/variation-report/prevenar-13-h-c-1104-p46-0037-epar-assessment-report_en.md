## 2. Clinical studies

6096A1-012:    A  phase  3,  randomized,  active-controlled,  double-blind  trial  evaluating  the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy infants given with routine pediatric vaccinations in Brazil

##  Description

Wyeth Lederle Vaccines S.A. states that study 6096A1-012 is part of the global clinical development program for the use of Prevenar 13 in infants and were conducted to support licensure in Brazil.

##  Methods

##  Objective(s)

The primary objectives of this study were as follows:

-  To assess the pneumococcal immune  responses induced by 13vPnC relative to the pneumococcal immune responses induced by 7vPnC when measured 1 month after the infant series.
-  To  assess  the  immune  responses  induced  by  diphtheria,  tetanus,  whole  cell  pertussis,  and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTP-Hib) given with 13vPnC relative to the immune responses  induced  by  DTP-Hib  given  with  7vPnC  when  measured  1  month  after  the  infant series.The  following  antigens  in  DTP-Hib  were  assessed:  pertussis  antigens  (pertussis  toxoid [PT], filamentous haemagglutinin [FHA], and pertactin [PRN]).

The secondary objectives of this study were as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  To assess the pneumococcal immune  responses induced by 13vPnC relative to the pneumococcal immune responses induced by 7vPnC when measured 1 month after the toddler dose.
-  To  assess  the  immune  responses  induced  by  DTP-Hib  given  with  13vPnC  relative  to  the immune responses induced by DTP-Hib given with 7vPnC when measured 1 month after the toddler dose. The following antigens in DTP-Hib were assessed: pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, and PRN).

The safety objective of this study was as follows:

-  To  evaluate  the  acceptability  of  the  safety  profile  of  13vPnC  as  measured  by  the  incidence rates of local reactions, systemic events, and adverse events (AEs).

##  Study design

This  was  a  phase  3,  randomized,  active-controlled,  double-blind,  parallel-group,  multicenter  trial  to evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability,  and  immunogenicity  of  13vPnC  in  healthy  infants  and  toddlers  in Brazil. Subjects received either 13vPnC or 7vPnC (177 subjects randomly assigned to each group) at 2, 4, and 6 months of age (infant series) and at 12 months of age (toddler dose). The concomitant study vaccines were administered as follows: hepatitis B virus vaccine (HBV) at 1 and 6 months of age and diphtheria, tetanus, whole cell pertussis with Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTP-Hib) at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age. Oral polio vaccine (OPV) was also to be given at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age.

##  Study population /Sample size

Sample size estimation was based on the precision of the 2-sided 95% CI for the proportion of subjects achieving  a  serotype-specific  pneumococcal  IgG  concentration  ≥0.35  μg/mL  and  the  proportion  of subjects achieving a whole-cell pertussis antibody level ≥5 EU/mL in each vaccine group. Data from Wyeth studies 6096A1-003 and D118-P3 were used for the pneumococcal serotypes and the whole-cell pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, and PRN), respectively.

Assuming a dropout rate of at most 15%, 354 subjects (177 subjects per group) overall were to be enrolled  to  obtain  150  evaluable  subjects  per  group  in  the  study.  This  allowed  estimation  of  the proportion  of  responders  after  the  infant  series  third  dose  (primary  objective)  to  within  ±7.3% precision.

##  Treatments

Subjects were to receive either 13vPnC or 7vPnC at 2, 4, and 6 months of age (infant series) and at 12 months  of  age  (toddler  dose).  The  mandatory  concomitant  study  vaccines  were  administered  as follows: hepatitis B virus vaccine (HBV) at 1 month and 6 months of age, and DTP-Hib at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age. Initially, oral polio vaccine (OPV) was to be given at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age; however, this was changed so that subjects could receive OPV at any time during the study and it could count as the study visit dose if given within 28 days of the visit, because of an ongoing National Vaccination Campaign against Poliomyelitis in Brazil during the study period. Additional concomitant vaccines  that  could  have  been  given  at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator  according  to  the  national recommended vaccination schedule included meningitis C vaccine (Meningitec); measles, mumps, and rubella  vaccine  (MMR);  varicella  vaccine;  rotavirus  vaccine;  yellow  fever  vaccine;  and  influenza vaccine. A birth dose of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) was allowed.

##  Outcomes/endpoints

## Pneumococcal Antibody Response

Blood samples were to be obtained at visit 5 (28 through 56 days after the  third dose in the infant series) and at visit 7 (28 through 56 days after the toddler dose). Serum concentrations of anticapsular IgG for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were to be determined in all subjects for each blood sample and expressed as micrograms per milliliter  (μg/mL).  The  assay  employed 2 absorbents, a C polysaccharide containing cell wall extract plus serotype 22F capsular polysaccharide.

Assessor's  comment :  OPA  responses  were  not  assayed  in  this  study,  which  is  a  limitation,  and precludes a full assessment of the immune responses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Concomitant Vaccine Antibody Response

Serum levels of IgG antibodies to PT, FHA, and  PRN (69 kDa outer membrane protein) were to be measured using an anti-Bordetella pertussis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) performed on blood samples collected 1 month after the infant series and 1 month after the toddler dose. Results were to be reported as ELISA units per milliliter (EU/mL).

Assessor's comment: Only the antibody responses to the pertussis component were evaluated in this study report. The same approach was used in some previously reported studies (see original MAA). It it therefore not possible to assess whether concomitant vaccination has an impact on the responses to the other antigens in this study.

## Safety Assessment Methods:

Safety  assessments  were  to  be  based  on  data  from  the  daily  monitoring  and  recording  of  local reactions at the injection site, systemic events, and use of antipyretic medication to treat and prevent symptoms by the parent(s)/legal  guardian(s)  in  an  e-diary  for  4  days  after  each  13vPnC  or  7vPnC vaccine administration (day 1 through day 4) and AE monitoring through visit 5 and from visit 6 to 7.

Local  reactions  (redness,  swelling,  and  tenderness)  on  the  left  leg  at  the  site  of  the  pneumococcal conjugate injection were to be monitored daily for 4 days (day 1 through day 4) after each vaccine administration and this information was recorded in the e-diary by the parent(s)/legal guardian(s). The parent(s)/legal guardian(s) were to measure the actual size of redness or swelling with a caliper and record the measurement (1 to 14 or 14+ caliper units) in whole number increments in the e-diary. Each caliper unit represented 0.5 cm, and measurements were to be rounded up to the nearest whole number. If  tenderness  was  present,  whether  or  not  it  interfered  with  limb  movement,  it  was  to  be recorded.  The  measurements  for  redness  and  swelling  were  to  be  categorized  as  absent  (0  caliper units), mild (0.5 to 2.0 cm; 1 to 4 caliper units), moderate (2.5 to 7.0 cm; 5 to 14 caliper units), or severe (&gt;7.0 cm; &gt;14 caliper units) for analyses. If the measurement of redness or swelling was &gt;7.0 cm  (&gt;14  caliper  units),  the  subject  was  to  be  seen  by  study  personnel  for  a  medical  assessment. Tenderness was to be recorded as none, present, or interfered with limb movement.

Systemic  events  (decreased  appetite,  irritability,  increased  sleep,  and  decreased  sleep)  were  to  be monitored  daily  and  their  presence  or  absence  was  recorded  in  the  e-diary  for  4  days  after  each vaccine  administration  (day  1  through  day  4).  Axillary  temperature  was  to  be  collected  daily  at bedtime for  4  days,  and  at  anytime  during  the  4  days  if  fever  was  suspected.  If  a  fever  (≥38.0°C [100.4  °F])  occurred,  temperature  was  to  be  collected  daily  until  the  fever  resolved  (1  day  of temperature &lt;38.0 °C [100.4°F]). Temperature was to be measured and recorded to 1 decimal place and then categorized according to the following terms and scale: absent (&lt;38.0°C [100.4°F]), mild (≥38.0°C [100.4°F] to &lt;39.0°C [102.2°F]), moderate (≥39.0°C [102.2°F] to &lt;40.0°C [104.0°F]), and severe (≥40.0°C [104.0°F]). An end date was to be captured for any reactions persisting at day 4.

In addition, the use of antipyretic medications to prevent or treat symptoms was to be recorded daily during the active safety observation periods (day 1 through day 4) after each vaccine administration. An end date was to be recorded for any antipyretic medication use persisting at day 4.

Signs and symptoms (AEs) were to be assessed and recorded during the physical examination and on clinical evaluation of the subject at the study visits. Clinic personnel were to observe the subject for at least 30 minutes after each vaccination for any significant, acute reactions. AEs were to be identified based on a review of any ancillary information reported on the e-diary, on clinical evaluation at the time  of  a  study  visit,  or  from  information  obtained  by  asking  the  parent(s)/legal  guardian(s)  a nonspecific question such as 'How has your child been doing since your last visit?'

A subject's AEs were to be recorded from the signing of the ICF to visit 5 (1 month after infant series) and from visit 6 (toddler dose) to visit 7 (1 month after toddler dose). At visit 6 any newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions since visit 5 were to be recorded. All SAEs were to be recorded from the signing of the ICF to visit 7. During the clinical trial, the investigator had to follow up on all AEs, SAEs, and other  reportable  information  until  the  events  had  subsided,  returned  to  baseline,  or  in  case  of permanent impairment, until the condition stabilized.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Statistical Methods

The primary endpoint for each of the pneumococcal serotypes was the proportion of subjects achieving a  serotype-specific  IgG  concentration  ≥0.35  μg/mL  measured  1  month  after  the  infant  series.  This choice of endpoint was based upon a World Health Organization (WHO) guideline for the pneumococcal serotypes.25 The coprimary endpoint for each of the whole-cell pertussis antigens was the proportion of subjects achieving a predetermined antibody level measured 1 month after the infant series. The prespecified antibody levels for each whole-cell pertussis antigen were defined as PT, FHA, and PRN levels ≥5 EU/mL.

The  secondary  endpoint  for  each  of  the  pneumococcal  serotypes  was  the  proportion  of  subjects achieving  a  serotype-specific  IgG  concentration  ≥0.35  μg/mL  measured  1  month  after  the  toddler dose. The cosecondary endpoint for each of the whole-cell pertussis antigens was the proportion of subjects achieving PT, FHA, and PRN antibody levels of ≥5 EU/mL 1 month after the toddler dose.

All statistical analyses are descriptive and any comparisons between the 13vPnC and the 7vPnC groups are descriptive.

##  Results

##  Recruitment/ Number analysed

The number of subjects planned for this study was 354 (177 subjects in each vaccine group). A total of 356 subjects were enrolled, 2 of whom were screened but not randomly assigned. The subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio prospectively to either the 13vPnC group (n=177) or the 7vPnC group (n=177)  and  316  (89.3%)  subjects  completed  the  infant  series.  Of  the  312  (88.1%)  subjects vaccinated at the toddler dose, 309 (87.3%) subjects completed the study.

Thirty-eight (38, 10.7%) subjects were withdrawn from the study during the infant series: 20 (11.3%) subjects in the 13vPnC group and 18 (10.2%) subjects in the 7vPnC group. After the infant series (ie, in the period between the blood draw after visit 3 and visit 5), 4 (1.1%) subjects withdrew (1 subject in  the  13vPnC  group  and  3  subjects  in  the  7vPnC  group).  Three  (3,  0.8%)  subjects  in  the  13vPnC group were withdrawn from the study during the toddler dose period.

Assessor's comment: The number of subjects withdrawn from the study is as can be expected from previous studies, or slightly higher. The reasons for withdrawal did not differ between the groups.

##  Baseline data

Overall, 48.6% of the subjects were male and 51.4% were female, and the groups were similar with respect to race, ethnicity, age, and weight at enrolment. Across both vaccine groups, most subjects were white (84.8%) and all were Hispanic or Latino. In both vaccine groups, the mean age (±standard deviation  [SD])  at  enrolment  was  1.2  (±0.2)  months,  with  ages  ranging  from  1.0  months  to  2.3 months. Mean weight (±SD) at enrolment was 4.2 (±0.6) kg in both the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups.

##  Efficacy results

## Proportion of Subjects Achieving Pneumococcal IgG Concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL Infant series

One (1) month after the infant  series,  13vPnC  elicited  serum  IgG  antibody  concentrations  to  the  7 common serotypes that were comparable with the responses elicited by 7vPnC (Table 9-3).

For  the  7  common  serotypes,  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  IgG  concentrations  ≥0.35  μg/mL  was 94.2% or higher in the 13vPnC group and 93.0% or higher in the 7vPnC group.

13vPnC  also  elicited  serum  IgG  antibody  responses  to  the  6  additional  serotypes  not  contained  in 7vPnC.  The  percentage  of  13vPnC  recipients  with  IgG  concentrations  ≥0.35  μg/mL  was  87.1%  for serotype  3  and  greater  than  97%  for  the  other  5  serotypes.  The  percentage  of  responders  among 13vPnC recipients was significantly higher than the percentage of responders in the 7vPnC group for all serotypes except 19A.

In the 7vPnC group, the proportion of responders with IgG concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL 1 month after the  infant  series  ranged  from  1.3%  (serotype  7F)  to  98.7%  (serotype  19A)  for  the  6  additional serotypes. The response rates to serotypes 5, 6A, and 19A were higher compared with the percentages of  responders  to  serotypes  1,  3,  and  7F.  The  high  responses  to  serotypes  19A  and  6A  (98.7%  and 52.6%), may be due to cross-reactivity with the 19F and 6B serotypes, respectively.

The  all-available  pneumococcal  infant  immunogenicity  population  showed  similar  results  (data  not shown in this AR).

Assessor's comments: The frequencies of subjects achieving a pneumococcal IgG concentration ≥0.35 µg/ml  is  not  significantly  different  from  what  has  been  seen  in  other  studies.  The  responses  to serotype 6B are generally higher than what has been seen in several other studies from other locations previously,  and  the  response  to  serotype  3  is  lower  than  what  was  seen  in  at  least  some  previous studies (006). A more relevant comparison between groups for the 6 additional serotypes in the 13valent vaccine would have been to use the lowest response rate seen for the 7 common serotypes in the Pnc7 group as a comparator.

## Toddler Dose

After the toddler dose, 13vPnC elicited serum IgG antibody concentrations to the 7 common serotypes that were comparable with the responses elicited by 7vPnC (Table 9-4). The proportion of responders with IgG concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL were 97.4% or higher in the 13vPnC group and 98.7% or higher in the 7vPnC group.

For the 6 additional serotypes not contained in 7vPnC, the percentage of 13vPnC recipients with IgG concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL was 92.1% for serotype 3 and 100.0% for the other 5 serotypes.

The percentage of responders among 13vPnC recipients was significantly higher than the percentage of responders among 7vPnC recipients for all serotypes except serotype 19A.

In the 7vPnC group, the proportion of responders with IgG concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL 1 month after the  toddler  dose  ranged  from  2.7%  (serotype  1)  to  100.0%  (serotype  19A)  for  the  6  additional serotypes. The response rates to serotypes 5, 6A, and 19A were higher compared with the percentages of responders to serotypes 1, 3, and 7F. The high responses to serotypes 19A and 6A (100.0% and 92.1%), may be due to cross-reactivity with the 19F and 6B serotypes, respectively.

The  all-available  pneumococcal  toddler  immunogenicity  population  showed  similar  results  (data  not shown in this AR).

## Pneumococcal IgG Geometric Mean Concentrations Infant Series

For the 7 common serotypes, serotype-specific IgG GMCs were comparable with those in the 7vPnC group; ranging from 1.47 μg/mL for serotype 9V to 6.32 μg/mL for serotype 14 in the 13vPnC group, and from 1.69 μg/mL for serotype 9V to 6.86 μg/mL for serotype 14 in the 7vPnC group (Table 9-5). For all 6 of the additional serotypes, the IgG GMCs for 13vPnC recipients were higher than the GMCs for 7vPnC recipients (the lower limit of the 95% CI was &gt;1.0). In the 13vPnC group, serotype-specific IgG GMCs ranged from 0.77 μg/mL for serotype 3 to 4.30 μg/mL for serotype 7F. In the 7vPnC group, serotype-specific IgG GMCs ranged from 0.02 μg/mL for serotype 1 to 1.83 μg/mL for serotype 19A. The all-available pneumococcal infant immunogenicity population showed similar results.

Assessor's  comments: For  the  7  common  serotypes  the  GMCs  were  generally  slightly  lower  in  the 13vPnC group than in the 7vPnC group, which is on accordance with previously reported studies. The levels are well within the previously reported GMC from other studies.

## Toddler Dose

For the 7 common serotypes after the toddler dose, IgG GMCs in the 13vPnC group were comparable with those in the 7vPnC group with the exception of serotype 19F, which was significantly higher for 13vPnC recipients (lower limit of the 95% CI was &gt;1.0) after the toddler dose (Table 9-6). Serotypespecific  IgG  GMCs  ranged  from  3.07  μg/mL  for  serotype 9V  to  13.04  μg/mL  for  serotype 6B  in  the 13vPnC group, and from 2.76 μg/mL for serotype 9V to 11.68 μg/mL for serotype 6B in the 7vPnC group.

For all 6 of the additional serotypes, the IgG GMCs in 13vPnC recipients were higher than the GMCs for 7vPnC recipients (the lower limit of the 95% CI was &gt;1.0). In the 13vPnC group, serotype-specific IgG GMCs ranged from 0.85 μg/mL for serotype 3 to 8.96 μg/mL for serotype 6A. In the 7vPnC group, serotype-specific IgG GMCs ranged from 0.03 μg/mL for serotype 1 to 3.59 μg/mL for serotype 19A. The all-available pneumococcal toddler immunogenicity population showed similar results.

Assessor's comment: The GMCs are generally in line with what has been reported following the toddler dose previously.

## Concomitant Vaccine Immunogenicity

In this study, 13vPnC or 7vPnC was administered concomitantly with DTP-Hib and the responses to 3 pertussis antigens, pertussis toxoid (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (PRN) were compared in the 2 groups. The percentage of responders (≥5 EU/mL) varied across the 3 antigens, but was not different in 13vPnC and 7vPnC recipients. The percentage of responders to PT was low (13vPnC 35.9%, 50.7%; 7vPnC 32.3%, 49.3%, respectively) in both groups after the infant series and  toddler  dose.  The  percentage  of  responders  to  FHA  was  high  (13vPnC  70.1%,  91.4%;  7vPnC 71.5%, 88.8%, respectively) in both groups after the infant series and toddler dose. The percentage of responders to PRN was also high (13vPnC 93.5%, 99.3%; 7vPnC 96.2%, 98.7%, respectively) in both groups after the infant series and toddler dose. A technical report assessing the immune responses to the  DTP-Hib  vaccine  used  in  this  study,  showed  that  the  proportion  of  infants  with  levels  of  antipertussis  antibodies  indicative  of  seroprotection  (≥15  UEL/mL)  was  &gt;98%.  There  are  no  published data (including the package insert for the Brazilian combined DTP-Hib vaccine) on the responses to specific antigens (PT, FHA, PRN), to which the responses seen in the current study can be compared. The GMCs for the pertussis antigens also show similar results for the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups. These data  support  a  conclusion  that  13vPnC  can  be  given  as  part  of  the  routine  immunization  schedule without impacting pertussis responses.

Assessor's  comment :  The  immune  responses  to  the  PT  component  were  unexpectedly  low  in  this study,  but  it  is  unclear  what  the  clinical  relevance  of  this  is.  In  one  other  study  using  whole  cell pertussis vaccine the responses to PT were considerably higher (see study 011, assessed in the original MAA, and FUM 008 currently under assessment). The low responses to pertussis causes some concern, but considering that this phenomenon has not been seen in other studies no further action is required. Several  studies  using  acellular  pertussis  vaccines  have  evaluated  the  responses  to  concomitantly administered pertussis vaccines, but they do not confirm the results of this study.

##  Safety results

## Local Reactions

During the 4-day reactogenicity period after each vaccine administration, the  numbers  and percentages  of  subjects  reporting  local  reactions  were  comparable  between  the  13vPnC  and  7vPnC groups and there were no significant differences between the groups for individual reactions. At least 1 local  reaction  was  reported  for  53.7% to 61.4% of subjects in the 13vPnC group and for 51.5% to 63.5% of subjects in the 7vPnC group after the 3 infant series doses, and for 68.8% and 54.7% of subjects in the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups, respectively, after the toddler dose. In both vaccine groups, most local  reactions  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  The  most  frequent  local  reaction  was  local tenderness. Significant local tenderness was reported by 14% or fewer in either vaccine group after the infant series and 18.3% or fewer after the toddler dose; however, the duration of any tenderness was 2.4 days or less in the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups.

No severe swelling or redness at the injection site was reported. Generally, the mean duration for any local reaction after any dose was 1 to 2 days with most reactions reported on the first 2 days after study vaccine administration and declining thereafter.

## Systemic Events

The numbers and percentages of subjects reporting systemic events were comparable between the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups and few differences were noted between groups for individual events. Few subjects reported fever during the 4-day reactogenicity period after each vaccine administration and most cases of fever were mild in severity (38.0°C to 39.0°C). Severe fever (&gt;40°C) was reported in 1 subject in each group after dose 3 of the infant series and was reported in 1 subject in the 13vPnC group after the toddler dose. Irritability was the most frequently reported systemic event after each dose. Overall, most systemic events, as well as antipyretic medication use, were reported on the first 2 days after study vaccine administration and the mean durations of individual events did not exceed 2.9 days across groups.

## Spontaneously Reported Adverse Events

The  percentages  of  subjects  reporting  AEs  were  similar  in  the  13vPnC  and  7vPnC  groups  and  few differences were noted between the groups. For the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups, respectively, at least 1 AE was reported in 85.9% and 86.4% of subjects during the infant series; 11.0% and 7.4% of subjects after the infant series; and 44.5% and 41.0% of subjects after the toddler dose. Most AEs reported were consistent with illnesses considered common in this age group and were characterized as mild in severity. AEs categorized as infections and infestations were reported most frequently in both vaccine groups at all doses. During the infant series, 1 subject in the 7vPnC group had a life-threatening AE of intussusception,  which  resolved  and  was  not  considered  related  to  study  vaccine.  No  other  lifethreatening AEs were reported.

Most SAEs reported were consistent with illnesses considered common in this age group and were most frequently categorized as infections and infestations. No significant differences between vaccine groups were  noted  for  any  individual  SAEs.  All  SAEs,  except  for  2  that  occurred  during  the  infant  series (HHEs), were considered unrelated to study vaccine administration and all resolved without sequelae.

One (1) subject died during the study of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) after receiving an HBV dose at visit 1 during the infant series; this subject did not receive pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. This event was assessed as not related to vaccine administration. There were no other subject deaths during the study.

Six (6) subjects were withdrawn from the study because of AEs. Five (5) subjects (2 in the 13vPnC group and 3 in the 7vPnC group) were withdrawn from the study during the infant series because of AEs: 4 subjects for the SAE HHE and 1 subject for the SAE grand mal convulsion. The HHE rate was similar to the rates reported after vaccination with DTP-Hib alone. One (1) subject in the 7vPnC group was withdrawn from the study during the period after the infant series because of the SAE congenital hydrocephalus. No subjects were withdrawn from the study after the toddler dose.

Assessor's comment : The safety results did not reveal any unexpected safety signal. The frequency of local  and  systemic  adverse  events  was  similar  to  what  has  been  reported  previously.  It  should  be noted that an interim report for study 6096A1-012 (CSR-78828) was submitted to the EMA on 5 May 2010 as part of the Type II variation procedure EMEA/H/C/1104/II/016. The purpose of this Type II variation  was  to  move  the  'hypotonic-hyporesponsive  episode'  (HHE)  undesirable  effect  from  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Prevenar clinical trial ADR section to the Prevenar 13 clinical trial ADR section of the SmPC and in the PL. This change was based on the trial findings reported after the infant series. The MAH committed on 18 May 2010 (as part of the responses to the validation issues) to submit the full CSR describing the trial  findings  from  both  the  infant  series  and  toddler  dose  in  the  present  Article  46  submission.  No further regulatory action is considered necessary.

6096A1-3004:  A phase 3, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a 13- valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy infants given with routine pediatric vaccinations in Taiwan

##  Description

Wyeth Lederle Vaccines S.A. states that study 6096A1-3004 is part of the global clinical development program for the use of Prevenar 13 in infants and were conducted to support licensure in Taiwan.

##  Methods

##  Objective(s)

The primary objective of the study was to describe the pneumococcal immune responses induced by 13vPnC relative to the pneumococcal immune responses induced by 7vPnC when measured 1 month after the infant series. The secondary objective of the study was to describe the pneumococcal immune responses induced by 13vPnC relative to the immune responses induced by 7vPnC when measured 1 month after the toddler dose. The safety objective of the study was to evaluate the acceptability of the safety profile of 13vPnC as measured by the incidence rates of local reactions, systemic events, and adverse events (AEs).

##  Study design

This was a parallel-group, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial to describe the immunogenicity,  safety,  and  tolerability  of  13vPnC  compared  with  7vPnC  in  healthy  infants,  when given with routine pediatric vaccinations in Taiwan.

##  Study population /Sample size

Approximately  168  subjects  (84  subjects  per  group)  were  to  be  enrolled  in  this  study  in  order  to achieve 75 evaluable subjects per group at 2 sites in Taiwan.

Sample size estimation was based on the proportion of responders in the 13vPnC dose group. Data from  Wyeth  study  6096A1-003  were  used  for  the  proportion  of  responders  for  pneumococcal serotypes.    The  study  was  powered  to  allow  estimation  of  the  proportion  of  responders  to  within ±7.3% precision  for  each  vaccine  group.  Assuming  a  drop  out  rate  of  at  most  10%,  168  subjects overall should be enrolled to ensure 150 subjects are evaluable.

##  Treatments

Subjects were to be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 13vPnC or 7vPnC administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age (infant series) and 15 months of age (toddler dose). Routine pediatric combination  vaccines  containing  diphtheria,  tetanus,  and  acellular  pertussis  (DTaP);  inactivated poliovirus (IPV); Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib); and hepatitis B virus (HBV) were to be given; DTaP-IPV-Hib was to be administered at 2 and 4 months of age (infant series); DTaP-IPV-Hib-HBV was to be administered at 6 months of age.

##  Outcomes/endpoints

Immunogenicity assessment methods: Blood samples (approximately 5 mL) were collected 27 to 56 days  after  dose  3  of  the  infant  series,  and  27  to  56  days  after  the  toddler  dose.  All  samples  were analyzed using ELISA to determine serum concentrations of anticapsular polysaccharide IgG for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F).

Assessor's  comment :  OPA  responses  were  not  assayed  in  this  study,  which  is  a  limitation,  and precludes a full assessment of the immune responses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety  assessment  methods:  Safety  measurements  included  evaluation  of  local  reactions,  systemic events (including fever and use of antipyretic medications), and adverse events. For days 1 to 4 after each vaccination, the parent(s)/guardian(s) were to record local reactions and systemic events daily in an e-diary. For any local reaction or systemic event that persisted on day 4 an end date was to be recorded.

Local Reactions: Local reactions included redness, swelling, and tenderness at the injection site and were  recorded  for 4  days after  each  vaccination.  Tenderness  was  recorded  as  none,  present,  or interfered with limb movement. For redness and swelling, the parent/legal guardian measured the size of  the  local  reaction  at  its  largest  diameter  with  a  caliper  and  recorded  the  measurement  in  caliper units (1 to 14, or 14+). One (1) caliper unit represents 0.5 cm. In case a calliper measurement was between 2 values, the higher value was to be reported. If the measurement of redness or swelling was greater than 14 caliper units (greater than 7.0 cm), the subject was to be seen by study personnel. The measurements for redness and swelling were categorized as mild (0.5 to 2.0 cm), moderate (2.5 to 7.0 cm), or severe (greater than 7.0 cm) for analysis.

Systemic Events: Tympanic temperature was collected daily at bedtime for 4 days and at any time during days 1 through 4 if fever was suspected. Fever was defined as tympanic temperature of greater than or equal to 38.0°C (100.4°F). In the event of a fever, temperature was collected daily until the fever had resolved (1 day of temperature less than 38.0°C). For analysis, the severity of fever was categorized as follows: absent &lt;38.0°C; mild ≥38.0°C to ≤39.0°C; moderate &gt;39.0°C to ≤40.0°C; and  severe  &gt;40.0°C.  The  use  of  antipyretic  medications  to  prevent  or  treat  symptoms  was  also recorded daily for 4 days. Other systemic events recorded in the e-diary as present or absent included decreased appetite, irritability, increased sleep, and decreased sleep.

Adverse Events: After each vaccination, clinic personnel observed the subject for at least 30 minutes for any significant, acute reactions. Any AEs noted in this observation period were recorded in the CRF. In  addition,  AEs  were  identified  based  on  clinical  evaluation  at  the  time  of  a  study  visit,  or  from information obtained by asking the parents/legal guardians. Signs and symptoms were recorded using standard  medical  terminology.  Both  AEs  and  SAEs  had  to  be  recorded  on  both  subject's  source documents and CRFs.

##  Statistical Methods

Immunogenicity: The primary immunological comparisons were the pneumococcal immune responses in  subjects  receiving  13vPnC  relative  to  the  immune  responses  in  subjects  receiving  7vPnC.  All statistical  analyses  were  descriptive.  For  the  immunogenicity  analyses,  2  analysis  populations  were defined: evaluable infant immunogenicity population and all-available infant immunogenicity population.

The  primary  endpoint  for  each  pneumococcal  serotype  was  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving serotype-specific  IgG  concentrations  ≥0.35  μg/mL  (ie,  the  proportion  of  responders)  measured  1 month after dose 3 of the infant series. Exact, unconditional, 2-sided, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on the proportion were calculated. For each of the pneumococcal serotypes, exact, unconditional, 2sided, 95% CIs on the difference in proportions (13vPnC - 7vPnC) were calculated. In addition for each of the 6 additional serotypes, exact, unconditional, 2-sided, 95% CIs on the difference in proportions were calculated using the serotype with the lowest proportion among the 7 common serotypes in the 7vPnC group as the reference group (13vPnC - 7vPnC reference).

The pneumococcal serotype IgG concentrations were logarithmically transformed for analysis. Within each vaccine group and for each antibody concentration separately, geometric means of the antibody concentrations from each blood draw were calculated. Two (2)-sided, 95% CIs were constructed by back transformation of the CIs for the mean of the logarithmically transformed assay results computed using  the  Student  t  distribution.  In  addition,  for  each  of  the  serotypes,  the  ratios  of  the  geometric mean concentrations ([GMCs] 13vPnC/7vPnC) with their 2-sided, 95% CIs were calculated. For the 6 additional  serotypes,  an  additional  comparison  was  made  using  the  serotype  with  the  lowest  GMC among the 7 common serotypes in the 7vPnC group as the reference value (13vPnC/7vPnC reference).

The empirical reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) were presented graphically by vaccine group for each of the serotype-specific pneumococcal concentrations.

Safety:  The  incidence  of  local  reactions,  systemic  events,  and  AEs  were  summarized  separately  for each dose of pneumococcal vaccine (dose 1, dose 2, dose 3, and the toddler dose). The proportions of subjects with local reactions and systemic events reported on any day within the 4-day period after

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

each  vaccination  were  summarized  for  each  type  of  event.  Local  reactions  were  also  summarized according to severity (mild, moderate, severe); and summary statistics for the duration (in days) of both local and systemic reactions were reported.

For summarization, AEs were categorized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  AE  summaries  show,  for  each  MedDRA  preferred  term,  the  number  and  percentage  of subjects experiencing at least 1 event and the number of events. SAEs were summarized for the infant series  rather  than  for  each  vaccination  separately.  Additional  summaries  by  AE  severity  and  by relationship to test article were also produced.

##  Results

##  Recruitment/ Number analysed

Approximately  168  subjects  (84  subjects  per  group)  were  to  be  enrolled  in  this  study  in  order  to achieve 75 evaluable subjects per group at 2 sites in Taiwan. A total of 169 subjects were screened, and  168  subjects  were  enrolled.  One  (1)  subject  whose  parents/legal  guardians  consented  to participate was screened only and was not randomized. Four (4) subjects (2.4%) were withdrawn from the  study  during  the  infant  series,  1  subject  was  randomized  but  not  vaccinated,  thus  only  167 subjects (99.4%) received dose 1; after receiving dose 1, 3 subjects were withdrawn at the request of the  parents/legal  guardians,  thus  164  subjects  (97.6%)  who  received  both  dose  2  and  dose  3 completed the infant series, 80 (95.2%) in the 13vPnC group and 84 (100.0%) in the 7vPnC group.

No subjects were withdrawn after the infant series. Thus, 164 subjects received the toddler dose of 13vPnC  (n=80)  or  7vPnC  (n=84).  These  subjects  constituted  the  safety  population  for  the  toddler dose,  and  all  completed  the  toddler  dose  blood  draw.  Of  the  84  subjects  randomized  to  receive 13vPnC, 80 were included in the all-available toddler immunogenicity population and 79 were included in the evaluable toddler immunogenicity population. In the 7vPnC group, all 84 subjects randomized to receive 7vPnC were included in the all-available and evaluable toddler immunogenicity populations. In the 13vPnC group, 4 subjects were excluded from the all-available toddler immunogenicity populations because they had no post-toddler assay result for any pneumococcal serotype (these 4 subjects were withdrawn  during  the  infant  series  at  the  request  of  the  parent[s]/legal  guardian[s]);  1  additional subject was also excluded from the evaluable toddler immunogenicity population because the subject was &gt;486 days old on the day of the toddler dose.

##  Baseline data

The 2 vaccine groups were similar with respect to sex, race, ethnicity, age at enrolment, and weight at enrolment. The proportion of male subjects was slightly higher in the 13vPnC group (52.4%) than in the  7vPnC  group  (44.0%).  All  subjects  (100.0%)  were  Asian  and  of  non-Hispanic  and  non-Latino ethnicity.

The mean age (±standard deviation [SD]) at enrolment was 2.2 (±0.3) months and the mean weight at enrolment was 5.5 (±0.8) kg for all subjects in both groups.

##  Efficacy results

## Proportion of Subjects Achieving a Pneumococcal IgG Antibody Concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL Infant series

For the evaluable infant immunogenicity population, for the 7 common serotypes the proportions of responders after dose 3 of the infant series were comparable and ranged from 95.0% to 100% in the 13vPnC group and was overall 100% in the 7vPnC group (Table 9-3). For the 6 additional serotypes unique to 13vPnC the proportion of responders in the 13vPnC group ranged from 97.5% to 100.0%; in the 7vPnC group responder rates for serotypes 1, 3, and 7F were 2.4%, for serotype 5 was 61.5%, for serotype 6A was 77.1%, and for serotype 19A was 100.0%.

For  the  comparison  of  13vPnC  relative  to  7vPnC,  the  difference  in  the  proportion  of  responders, between the 2 vaccine groups was calculated and presented in Table 9-3. For the 7 common serotypes the difference in the proportion of responders, ranged from -5.0 for serotype 23F to 0.0 for serotypes 6B, 14, and 18C. For the 6 additional serotypes the difference ranged from 0.0 for serotype 19A to 97.6 for serotype 7F.

For the 6 additional serotypes, when the serotype with the lowest proportion among the 7 common serotypes  in  the  7vPnC  group  as  the  reference  value  is  used  for  comparison  the  difference  in

b. n = Number of subjects with an antibody concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL for the given serotype.

a. N = number of subjects with a determinate IgG concentration to the given serotype.

c. Exact 2-sided confidence interval based on the observed proportion of subjects.

e. Exact 2-sided confidence interval for the difference in proportions, 13vPnC-7vPnC reference, expressed as a percentage.

d. Difference in proportions, 13vPnC7vPnC reference, expressed as a percentage.

Assessor's comments: The frequencies of subjects achieving a pneumococcal IgG concentration ≥0.35 µg/ml  is  not  significantly  different  from  what  has  been  seen  in  other  studies.  The  responses  to serotype 6B are generally higher than what has been seen in several other studies from other locations previously.

## Toddler dose

For the 7 common serotypes, the 2 vaccine groups had similar proportions of subjects achieving IgG concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL after the toddler dose. The proportions of responders to the 7 common serotypes  in  the  evaluable  toddler  immunogenicity  population  ranged  from  98.7%  to  100%  in  the 13vPnC group and were 100% for all serotypes in the 7vPnC group (Table 9-2). The difference in the proportion  of  responders  (13vPnC  -  7vPnC)  was  -1.3  for  serotypes  4,  9V,  and  19F  and  0.0  for serotypes 6B, 14, 18C, and 23F For the 6 additional serotypes unique to 13vPnC, the proportion of responders in the 13vPnC group ranged from 96.2% to 100.0%; in the 7vPnC group, responder rates for serotypes 1, 3, and 7F ranged from 5.0% to 13.8%, for serotype 5 it was 90.4%, for serotype 6A it was  100.0%,  and  for  serotype  19A  it  was  98.8%.  The  difference  in  the  proportion  of  responders ranged from 82.5% to 95.0% for serotypes 1, 3, and 7F and from 0% to 9.6% for serotypes 5, 6A, and  19A  (Table  9-2).  For  each  of  the  6  additional  serotypes,  the  difference  in  the  proportion  of responders  between  the  2  vaccine  groups  was  also  calculated  using  the  serotype  with  the  lowest proportion of responders among the 7 common serotypes in the 7vPnC group as the reference value. Thus  calculated,  the  difference  in  the  proportion  of  responders  was  0.0  for  5  of  the  6  additional serotypes; for serotype 3, the difference in the proportion of responders was -3.8.

## Pneumococcal IgG Geometric Mean Concentrations Infant series

In  the  evaluable  infant  immunogenicity  population,  IgG  GMCs  for  the  7  common  serotypes  were generally lower in the 13vPnC group and ranged from 1.93 (serotype 23F) to 9.76 μg/mL (serotype 14), compared with 2.92 (serotype 9V) to 11.59 μg/mL (serotype 14) in the 7vPnC group; for the 6 additional pneumococcal serotypes IgG GMCs were higher in the 13vPnC group and ranged from 1.20 (serotype 3 ) to 4.57 μg/mL (serotype 6A), compared with 0.02 (serotype 1) to 2.46 μg/mL (serotype 19A) in the 7vPnC group (Table 9-6).

For  the  comparison  of  13vPnC  relative  to  7vPnC,  the  GMC  ratio  (13vPnC/7vPnC)  was  calculated  for each serotype and summarized by vaccine group (Table 9-6). For the 7 common serotypes the ratio ranged from 0.59 for serotype 23F to 0.91 for serotype 6B. For the 6 additional serotypes the ratio ranged from 1.50 for serotype 19A to 202.58 for serotype 1.

b. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) were calculated using all subjects with available data for the specified blood draw.

a. n = Number of subjects with a determinate IgG concentration to the given serotype.

C. Confidence intervals (CIs) are back transformations of a confidence interval based on the Student t distribution for the mean logarithm of the concentrations.

d. Ratio of GMCs;13vPnC-7vPnC reference.

e. Confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratio are back transformations of a confidence interval based on the Student t distribution for the mean difference of the logarithms of the measures (13vPnC7vPnC reference).

Assessor's  comments: For  the  7  common  serotypes  the  GMCs  were  generally  slightly  lower  in  the 13vPnC group than in the 7vPnC group, which is on accordance with previously reported studies. The levels are well within the previously reported GMC from other studies.

## Toddler dose

For  the  7  common  serotypes,  GMCs  ranged  from  3.18  μg/mL  for  serotype  9V  to  13.62  μg/mL  for serotype 6B in the 13vPnC group and from 3.88 μg/mL for serotype 9V to 13.28 μg/mL for serotype 6B in the 7vPnC group. For the 6 additional serotypes, the GMCs were higher in the 13vPnC group. GMCs ranged from 1.29 μg/mL for serotype 3 to 11.55 μg/mL for serotype 6A in the 13vPnC group and from 0.03 μg/mL for serotype 1 to 3.79 μg/mL for serotype 6A in the 7vPnC group (Table 9-4).

For  the  comparison  of  13vPnC  relative  to  7vPnC,  the  GMC  ratios  were  calculated  for  each  serotype (Table 9-4). For the 7 common serotypes, the GMC ratios ranged from 0.64 for serotype 4 to 1.09 for serotype  19F.  For  the  6  additional  serotypes,  the  GMC  ratios  ranged  from  3.05  for  serotype  6A  to 303.73 for serotype 1.

For the 6 additional serotypes, the GMC ratios were also calculated using the serotype with the lowest GMC  among  the  7  common  serotypes  in  the  7vPnC  group  as  the  reference  value  (in  this  study, serotype 9V had the lowest GMC, 3.88). Thus calculated, the GMC ratio for the 6 additional serotypes ranged from 0.33 for serotype 3 to 2.98 for serotype 6A.

##  Safety results

## Local Reactions

The percentages of subjects reporting local reactions were comparable between the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups after the infant series and the toddler dose. At least 1 local reaction was reported for 33.3% to 51.3% of subjects in the 13vPnC group and for 30.4% to 51.9% of subjects in the 7vPnC group after the  3  infant  series  doses,  and  for  25.8%  and  30.7%  of  subjects  in  the  13vPnC  and  7vPnC  groups, respectively,  after  the  toddler  dose.  In  both  vaccine  groups,  most  local  reactions  were  mild  or moderate in severity and occurred on days 1 and 2. Significant local tenderness was reported by 9.3% or fewer subjects in either vaccine group after dose 1 and by 2.9% or fewer subjects in either vaccine group  after  dose  2  and  3  in  the  infant  series.  No  subject  in  either  vaccine  group  reported  severe swelling or severe redness at the injection site after any dose in the infant series. After the toddler dose,  no  significant  local  tenderness  and  no  severe  swelling  or  severe  redness  at  the  injection  site were reported for any subject in either vaccine group. There were few significant differences between the 2 vaccine groups in the incidence of any local reactions after the infant series, and none after the toddler dose.

## Systemic Events

The percentage of subjects reporting systemic events was generally similar in the 2 vaccine groups after each dose. The overall percentage of subjects reporting 1 or more systemic events within 4 days of vaccination ranged from 76.4% to 97.6% in the 13vPnC group and from 75.0% to 91.7% in the 7vPnC group, across the 3 doses in the infant series. After the toddler dose, 1 or more systemic events were reported by 54.2% and 61.0% of subjects in the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups, respectively. There were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  2  vaccine  groups  in  the  incidence  of  any systemic  events.  The  most  commonly  reported  systemic  events  were  mild  fever,  irritability,  and decreased appetite. Most reports of fever were mild in severity. Only 1 subject (1.6%) in the 7vPnC

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

group  reported  severe  fever  (&gt;40°C),  after  receiving  dose  3.  With  few  exceptions,  most  systemic events were reported on the first 2 days after each vaccination. For the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups, respectively, mean durations of individual systemic events did not exceed 3.3 and 2.5 days after the infant series, or 2.8 days and 3.5 days after the toddler dose.

## Spontaneously Reported Adverse Events

The  percentages  of  subjects  reporting  AEs  were  similar  in  the  13vPnC  and  7vPnC  groups  and  few differences were noted between the groups. For the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups, respectively, at least 1 AE  was  reported  in  72.3%  and  79.8%  of  subjects  during  the  infant  series;  25.3%  and  25.0%  of subjects after the infant series; and 26.3% and 19.0% of subjects after the toddler dose. Most of the AEs were illnesses that could be expected in infants and toddlers. The most frequent categories of AEs were infections and infestations and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. The individual AEs with the highest incidences were upper respiratory tract infections, eczema, and contact dermatitis. There was only 1 possibly related AE of alopecia after dose 1 in the study.

The SAEs reported were consistent with illnesses considered common in infants and toddlers and were most frequently categorized as infections and infestations. None were considered related to the study vaccine. No deaths or life-threatening events were reported in this study. No subject was withdrawn from the study because of an AE.

Assessor's comment: No new safety signals were detected in this study, and the pattern of adverse events was similar to what has been seen in previous studies. No further regulatory action is required based on safety data from this study.

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The two studies presented in this application are part of the global clinical development program for the  use  of  Prevenar  13  in  infants  and  were  conducted  to  support  licensure  in  Brazil  and  in  Taiwan, respectively.  The  vaccination  schedule  used  was  the  same  as  in  previously  submitted  studies.  The immunogenicity  and  safety  results  of  both  studies  are  well  in  line  with  what  has  been  previously reported in other studies. The only unexpected results were the low PT responses in study 012, but considering the number of studies which do not confirm these results, and the fact that the results were very similar  in  the  two  study  groups,  no  further  regulatory  action  is  required  based  on  these results.

## III. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

##  Overall conclusion

The MAH's conclusions of the study are endorsed. The results of this clinical study are well in line with previously  reported  results  from  other  clinical  studies.  Therefore,  the  submitted  data  does  not necessitate any changes to the current SPC, and no type II variation will be needed.
