## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Pradaxa, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

The contraindication in lesion or condition at significant risk for major bleeding which is now in place for Pradaxa does not allow for medical judgement, especially with regard to the prevention of VTE in surgery indications where, for example, an AV malformation or an aneurysm should not necessarily exclude  a  patient  from  receiving  one  of  the  new  anticoagulants.  This  concern  was  viewed  in perspective  of  safety  profile  of  Pradaxa  during  PSUR  period  and  was  acknowledged  by  PRAC (a decreasing trend of cumulative reporting rates for serious bleedings). Therefore, the contraindication about lesions and conditions is revised slightly allowing the prescribing physician some more room for  clinical  judgment  on  when  to  consider  the  listed  lesions  and  conditions  as  absolute contraindications.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Pradaxa the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance dabigatran etexilate is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.
