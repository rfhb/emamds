## 2. Steps taken for the assessment of the product

- During the CPMP September meeting 1995, it was agreed to perform an inspection on the USA manufacturing  facility for the finished medicinal product by the  Swedish  and  French Inspectorates.
- The  Rapporteur's  initial  Assessment  Report  was  circulated  to  all  Members  of  the  CPMP  on 25 October 1995. The Co-Rapporteur's initial Assessment Report was circulated to all Members of the CPMP on 27 October 1995.
- During the November 1995 CPMP meeting, the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur presented their Assessment  Reports.  A  consolidated  list  of  questions  was  proposed  to  be  adopted  at  the December  1995  CPMP  meeting.  The  CPMP  also  agreed  on  accepting  an  expedited  review process of this application.
- On 5 December 1995, the Rapporteur circulated an updated version of his overall conclusions on  this  medicinal  product  together  with  a  draft  consolidated  list  of  objections  and  points  for clarification  prepared  jointly  with  the  Co-Rapporteur.  These  related  to  issues  on  quality  (e.g. clarification of the hydrolytic degradation of stavudine, purity, enantiomeric purity), safety (e.g. carcinogenicity  results,  safety  data  obtained  from  more  treated  children),  and  efficacy  (e.g. subgroup efficacy analysis, cross-resistance induction). Proposed amendments of the Summary of  Product  Characteristics  (SPC),  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  and  Labelling  to  reflect  these  points were also circulated.
- The  CPMP  in  its  meeting  in  December  1995  agreed  on  a  consolidated  list  of  questions  as prepared  by  the  Rapporteur  and  Co-Rapporteur.  This  list  was  sent  to  the  Applicant  on 20 December 1995. A hearing with the applicant was planned to be held on 16 January 1996 at the  CPMP  meeting  in  order  to  address  any  remaining  concerns.  The  Rapporteur  presented  a preliminary report on the inspection of the USA manufacturing facility to all CPMP members.
- The applicant submitted the responses to the consolidated list of questions on 3 January 1996.
- The Rapporteur circulated the comments on the applicant's response to the consolidated list of questions to all CPMP Members on 9 January 1996.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- A hearing was held on 16 January 1996, at the CPMP meeting, where the applicant provided answers to the outstanding issues related to quality issues (details on methods used to confirm the purity of the reference standard, enantiomeric purity of stavudine, thymine specifications in stavudine, specifications for the two preservatives used) and efficacy issues ( in vitro phosphorylation interactions with stavudine, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia events, incidence of  pancreatitis  in  women,  indication  for  paediatric  patients,  risk/benefit  of  40  mg  stavudine twice daily (bid) vs 20 mg, food effect). These answers were either considered as acceptable or resulted in modifications of the SPC and PL.
- The  applicant submitted on 16 January 1996  a letter  of  commitment  (CPMP/057/96; CPMP/058/96) for providing results on the ongoing rodent carcinogenicity studies and on the development of a chromatographic method for the identification of the flavour constituent in the powder for oral solution. An additional commitment (CPMP/091/96) on proposing strategies to evaluate the incidence of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and potential interactions of stavudine with PCP prophylactic agents was agreed by the applicant on 18 January 1996. The applicant provided on 17 January a letter (CPMP/059/96) describing the ongoing stavudine clinical trials in combination therapy and in children.
- The CPMP in the light of the overall  data  submitted  and  the  scientific  discussion  within  the Committee issued a positive opinion for granting a marketing authorisation to the different oral presentations  and  strengths  of  stavudine  on  18  January  1996.  The  CPMP  opinions  were forwarded, in all official languages of the European Union, to the European Commission, which adopted the corresponding Decisions on 8 May 1996.

## 3. Steps taken after granting the Marketing Authorisation

- On  8  October  1996,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  submitted  in  parallel  three different applications for a Type I variation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95. The MAH applied for:
1.  the  change  of  the  manufacture  site  responsible  for  the  production  of  the  capsules,  for  the importation  of  the  powder  for  oral  solution  and  for  the  batch  release  in  the  EEA  of  both pharmaceutical  forms.  On  10  October  1996,  the  EMEA  approved  the  variation.  This variation required amendments to be incorporated in the relevant sections of the Commission Decision.
2.  the change of the manufacturing site for the labelling of the powder for oral solution. On 16 October  1996,  the  EMEA  approved  the  variation.  This  variation  did  not  require  any amendments to the Commission Decision, as amended.
3.  the  change  of  the  batch  size  of  the  finished  product  for  Zerit  15  mg  capsules.  On 7  November  1996,  the  EMEA  approved  the  variation.  This  variation  did  not  require  any amendments to the Commission Decision, as amended.
- On 23 September 1996, the MAH submitted an application for a type II variation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95. The scope of the variation concerned the update of the statement into the SPC related to Pneumocysitiis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis. On 17 October 1996, the CPMP agreed on the wording to be implemented into the SPC and adopted the opinion on the type II variation and the respective Commission Decision was issued on 3 February 1997.
- On 16 January 1997, the MAH submitted in parallel three applications for a type II variation, in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95. The MAH applied for:
1.  the extension of the therapeutic indication of Zerit to include paediatric patients
2.  the  update  of  the  SPC  with  additional  data  for  the  prescribing  physician  for  patients  with end-stage renal disease
3.  the update of the SPC related to the carcinogenic potential of Zerit following the finalisation of the studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CPMP considered these variations acceptable and agreed on the wording to be introduced into  the  appropriate  sections  of  the  SPC  and  reflected  into  the  PL.  The  CPMP  adopted  on 16  April  1997  an  opinion  on  the  three  type  II  variations,  and  the  respective  Commission Decision was issued on 28 July 1997.

- On 17 July 1997, the MAH submitted an application for a type II variation, in accordance with Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  542/95.  The  MAH  applied  for  the  update  of  the  safety sections  of  the  SPC  with  regard  to  the  occurrence  of  cases  of  lactic  acidosis  and  to  the streamlining of some undesirable effects. The CPMP considered this variation acceptable and agreed on the wording to be introduced into the appropriate sections of the SPC. The CPMP adopted  on  24  September  1997  an  opinion  on  the  type  II  variation,  and  the  respective Commission Decision was issued on 12 December 1997.
- In accordance with Article 10(3) of Council Directive 92/27/EEC of 31 March 1992, the EMEA issued  on  4  March  1998  a  Notification  for  amendment  of  the  addresses  of  the  local representatives mentioned in the Package Leaflet, as applied by the MAH.
- On 14 April 1998, the MAH submitted an application for a type I variation in accordance with Commission  Regulation  (EC)  542/95  related  to  the  change  of  the  batch  size  of  the  finished product for Zerit capsules 20 mg. On 11 May 1998 the EMEA approved the variation which did not lead to any changes to Commission Decision.
- In accordance with Article 10(3) of Council Directive 92/27 EEC of 31 March 1992, the EMEA issued  on  8  September  1998  a  Notification  for  amendments  of  the  addresses  of  the  local representatives included in the package leaflet as applied by the MAH.
