-  Solicited local AEs
-  Solicited general AEs
- Occurrence of grade 3 unsolicited AEs with relationship to vaccination within 31 days (Day 0Day 30) after vaccination.
- Occurrence of SAEs with relationship to vaccination throughout the entire study (from Month 0 up to Month 1)

Secondary outcomes variables:

Safety and Reactogenicity

- Occurrence of each solicited AE within 7 days (Day 0-Day 6) after vaccination.
-  Solicited local AE (any).
-  Solicited general AE (any and related).
- Occurrence of any unsolicited AE within 31 days (Day 0-Day 30) after vaccination.
- Occurrence of any SAE throughout the entire study (from Month 0 up to Month 1).

## Immunogenicity

- Evaluation of the immune responses to the components of the investigational vaccine, one month post-vaccination.
- Concentrations of antibodies against pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F.
- Concentrations of antibodies against protein D.
- Statistical Methods

Analyses were performed as per protocol. Demography:

- Demographic  characteristics  (age  in  months,  gender,  geographic  ancestry)  were tabulated per group.
- The  mean  age  (plus  range  and  standard  deviation)  of  the  enrolled  subjects  was calculated.
- The distribution of subjects enrolled among the study centres was tabulated.

Analysis of safety:

- The percentage of subjects with at least one local AE (solicited and unsolicited), with at least one general AE (solicited and unsolicited) and with any AE during the 31-day (Day 0-Day 30) follow-up period after vaccination was tabulated for each group with exact 95% Confidence  Interval  (CI).  The  same  calculations  were  performed  for  symptoms rated as grade 3 and general symptoms with causal relationship to vaccination.
- The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  each  individual  solicited  local  and  general  AE during  the  7-day  (Day  0-Day  6)  solicited  follow-up  period  after  vaccination  was tabulated for each group, with exact 95% CI.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The same tabulation was performed for grade 3 solicited AEs and for solicited AEs with causal relationship to vaccination. For redness and swelling, grade 2 or 3 AEs were also tabulated. Occurrence of fever was reported per 0.5°C cumulative increments.
- All the above tabulations for each individual solicited AE were also performed for the first 4 days after vaccination (Day 0-Day 3).
- The proportion of subjects with at least one report of unsolicited AE classified by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and reported up to 30 days after vaccination was tabulated with exact 95% CI for each group. The same tabulation was performed  for  grade  3  unsolicited  AEs  and  for  unsolicited  AEs  with  a  relationship  to vaccination.
- The proportion of AEs resulting in a medically attended visit was also tabulated.
- The number and percentage of subjects who took concomitant medication/antipyretic at  least  once  during  the  7-day  (Day  0-Day  6)  solicited  follow-up  period  after vaccination were tabulated for each group with exact 95% CI. The above tabulation for concomitant  medication/antipyretic  was  also  performed  for  the  first  4  days  after vaccination (Day 0-Day 3).
- SAEs,  large  swelling  reactions  and  withdrawal(s)  due  to  SAE(s)  were  described  in detail.

Analysis of immunogenicity:

- Geometric  mean  concentrations  (GMCs)  and  seropositivity  rates  with  95%  CIs  were tabulated for each group and for each serotype/antigen, prior to and one month after vaccination.
- The distribution of antibody concentrations/titres for each appropriate serotype/antigen was displayed using tables and/or reverse cumulative distribution curves.

##  Results

## · Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of  61  subjects  were  enrolled  in  this  study:  31  subjects  in  the  12Pn\\_T  group  and  30 subjects in the 10Pn\\_T group.

- Baseline data

The cohort used for the analysis of the primary objective is the Total vaccinated cohort. In this cohort, the mean age of subjects at the time of vaccination was 15.0 months, 55.7%  of  subjects  were  female  and  98.4%  of  subjects  were  of  White  Caucasian/European heritage.

## · Immunogenicity results

Prior  to  vaccination,  for  each  of  the  10  common  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotypes,  at  least 63.3% of subjects in the 12Pn\\_T group and at least 41.7 % of subjects in the 10Pn\\_T group had  antibody  concentrations  ≥0.2  µg/mL.  For  serotypes  6A  and  19A,  this  percentage  was 36.7% and 66.7%, respectively in the 12Pn\\_T group and 20.0% and 36.0% respectively in the 10Pn\\_T group.

One month post-vaccination, for each of the 10 common vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, all subjects in both groups had antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL. For serotypes 6A and 19A, this  percentage  was  100%  for  both  serotypes  in  the  12Pn\\_T  group  and  84.6%  and  96.3%, respectively in the 10Pn\\_T group.

For  each  of  the  pneumococcal  serotypes,  an  increase  was  observed  in  antibody  GMCs  one month post-vaccination compared to GMCs observed prior to vaccination in both groups.

The incidence of each solicited local AE during the 7-day (Day 0-Day 6) postvaccination period is shown in table 30. During the 7-day post-vaccination period:

Grade 3 solicited local AEs were reported for:

- 2 subjects (6.5%) (redness) and 3 subjects (9.7%) (swelling) out of 31 subjects in the 12Pn\\_T group and,
- 1 subject (3.4%) (swelling), out of 29 subjects in the 10Pn\\_T group.

As  per  protocol,  all  grade  3  solicited  local  AEs  were  considered  to  be  causally  related  to vaccination.

Redness at injection site was the most frequently reported solicited local AE in both groups (64.5% subjects in the 12Pn\\_T group and 65.5% subjects in the 10Pn\\_T group).

## Solicited general adverse events

The  incidence  of  each  solicited  general  AE  during  the  7-day  (Day  0-Day  6)  postvaccination period is shown in table 32 .

During the 7-day post-vaccination period:

- Grade 3 solicited general AEs were reported for:
- o 1 subject (3.2%) (fever) out of 31 subjects in the 12Pn\\_T group and,
- o 1 subject (3.4%) (irritability/fussiness) and 1 subject (3.4%) (fever) out of 29 in the 10Pn\\_T group.
- The grade 3 solicited general AE reported in the 12Pn\\_T group was not considered by the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to  vaccination.  In  the  10Pn\\_T  group,  the  two reported  grade  3  solicited  general  AEs  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be causally related to vaccination.
- Irritability/fussiness was the most frequently reported solicited general AE during the 7-day  post-vaccination  period  (48.4%  subjects  in  the  12Pn\\_T  group  and  48.3% subjects in the 10Pn\\_T group).

## Unsolicited adverse events

At least one unsolicited AE was reported for 58.1% of subjects in the 12Pn\\_T group and 50.0% of  subjects  in  the  10Pn\\_T  group  during  the  31-day  post-vaccination period. Rhinitis was the most  frequently  reported  unsolicited  AE  in  the  12Pn\\_T  group  [4  subjects  (12.9%)]  while diarrhea, bronchitis, otitis externa, rhinitis and viral infection were most frequently reported in the 10Pn\\_T group [2 subjects (6.7%)].

No  grade  3  unsolicited  AEs  or  grade  3  unsolicited  AEs  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be causally related to vaccination were reported in both groups.

## Serious adverse events

No fatal or non-fatal SAEs were reported during the study. No subject was withdrawn from the study due to an AE or SAE.

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The immunogenicity data from this study generally confirm what is known from other studies using Synflorix.  Likewise,  the  safety  data  do  not  add  any  new  safety  concerns  for  Synflorix,  and  the reactogenicity profile is similar to that seen in other studies. Therefore, it can be concluded that no further regulatory action is needed.
