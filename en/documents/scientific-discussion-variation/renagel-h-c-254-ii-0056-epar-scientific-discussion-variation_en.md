## Product Name : Renagel Procedure No: EMEA/H/C/000254/II/56

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Introduction

Renagel  (sevelamer),  a  non-absorbed,  calcium  and  metal-free  phosphate  binder,  was  authorised  in Europe under centralised procedure on 28 January 2000 for the indication of

'control  of  hyperphosphatemia  in  adult  patients  on  haemodialysis  (HD)  Renagel  should  be  used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplements, 1,25 - dihydroxy Vitamin D 3 or one of its analogues to control the development of renal bone disease'

and  is  currently  marketed  in  most  EU  countries  and  worldwide.  Renagel  was  authorised  under exceptional circumstances but this was lifted recently (Commission Decision 26 June 2006) following fulfilment of all specific obligations by the MAH.

The MAH applied for this Type II variation (EMEA/H/C/254/II/56) to extend the indication to patients on peritoneal  dialysis (PD) .  The  application  is  supported  by  a  clinical  study  in  patients  receiving peritoneal dialysis (study REN00304) and relevant literature.

## 2 Clinical aspects

The data presented by the MAH reviews the benefit/risk profile of Renagel in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) taking into account protocol REN00304 PD study and relevant efficacy and safety data available since the marketing authorisation.

The study REN00304 compared the effects of  dosed three times daily with meals and calcium acetate on serum phosphorus control in peritoneal dialysis patients, and evaluated the safety and tolerability of in this population. The results demonstrated non inferiority of  compared to calcium acetate in terms of reduction from baseline in serum phosphorus level. The study also confirmed the safety profile that was similar to that already established in the haemodialysis population.

The clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP, as stated by the MAH.

As patients with late chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 have minimal or no residual renal function, the excretory function of the kidney must be substituted via dialysis, ether haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The approach to treatment of hyperphosphataemia for both dialysis modalities is essentially the same. As renal failure progresses, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls and renal excretion of phosphorus  is  no  longer  sufficient  to  maintain  normal  serum  phosphorus  levels  in  the  face  of continuing  absorption  of  phosphorus  from  the  gastrointestinal  tract  and  mobilization  of  phosphorus from  bone.  Consequently,  hyperphosphataemia  develops,  usually  in  association  with  low  levels  of calcitriol and worsening hyperparathyroidism. Hyperphosphataemia is associated also with increased renal bone disease (renal osteodystrophy), increased cardiovascular and other soft tissue calcification and increased mortality.

Dietary  phosphate  restriction  and/or  dialysis  are  usually  insufficient  to  adequately  control  serum phosphorus. Therefore, phosphate binders are used by almost all dialysis patients to decrease intestinal absorption  of  phosphate  to  the  point  that  dialytic  clearance  can  maintain  an  acceptable  serum phosphorus concentration ideally between 1.13 - 1.77 mmol/l for stage 5 adult patients.

Peritoneal dialysis is one of two dialysis modalities to treat chronic uraemic patients. Haemodialysis is used more extensively than peritoneal dialysis, but there is a wide variation in practice across different countries. Coagulation abnormalities, lipid abnormalities and fluid overload are commonly felt to be more common in peritoneal dialysis patients although new onset cardiovascular disease is seen similar rate in both modalities. Comparable outcomes have been reported over the last 10 years.

The phosphate binders currently available contain mainly calcium or sometimes aluminium, which are associated with a variety of undesirable effects. Sevelamer hydrochloride, a non-absorbable phosphate-binding  polymer,  was  synthesised  to  enhance  phosphorus  excretion  while  minimising

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

systemic effects observed with other phosphorus binders. There are also some evidence that  may have beneficial effect on a number of plasma biomarkers (C-reactive protein (CRP), uric acid, bone specific alkaline phosphatase, random blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin).

## 2.1 Clinical efficacy

## Main study (REN00304)

The  MAH  presented  one  clinical  study,  protocol  REN00304.  The  objective  of  this  study  was  to evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  sevelamer  hydrochloride  compared  with  calcium  acetate  in peritoneal dialysis patients.

The study was a phase 3, multicentre, open label, and randomised, parallel group study. A total of 15 investigators from 17 investigative sites in Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain, The Netherlands, and United Kingdom participated in this study. The first patient was enrolled in December 2004 and the last patient completed in March 2006. Calcium acetate was used as the control group.

## Study population

A  total  of  150  patients  were  planned  for  randomisation.  Main  criteria  for  inclusion  were  chronic kidney disease (CKD) and peritoneal dialysis (Continuous Ambulatory (CAPD), Ambulatory (APD), or Continuous cyclical (CCPD)) for 8 weeks or longer and serum phosphorus level &gt; 5.50 mg/dL (1.77 mmol/L) after two weeks washout from patient's usual phosphate binder.

## Methods

## i. Study objectives

Primary objectives in peritoneal dialysis patients were to compare the effects of sevelamer dosed three times per day (TID) and calcium acetate dosed TID on serum phosphorus, and to investigate the safety and tolerability of sevelamer.

Secondary objectives  were  to  compare  the  effects  of  sevelamer  TID  and  calcium  acetate  on  serum calcium-phosphorous product (CaxPO4), serum lipids (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol,  HDL cholesterol and triglycerides)  and  a  number  of  plasma  biomarkers  (random  blood glucose, HbA1C, BSAP, uric acid and CRP).

## ii. Study endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was serum phosphorus level - a target of non-inferiority in comparison with calcium acetate was used as the criterion for power calculations. Non-inferiority was defined as a difference in the serum phosphorus change between treatment groups of statistically significantly less than 0.3 mmol/L.

Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  change  in  serum  calcium-phosphorus  product  (CaxPO4)  level, change in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and  change  in  random  blood  glucose,  glycosylated  haemoglobin  (HbA1C),  bone  specific  alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), uric acid, and C-reactive protein (CRP).

Safety  endpoints  included  incidence  of  adverse  events  (AEs)  and  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs), changes  in  vital  signs,  number  of  hypercalcaemic  episodes  and  changes  in  clinical  laboratory evaluations  (serum  phosphorous,  serum  calcium  (albumin-adjusted),  calcium  phosphorous  product, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), lipids, CRP, uric acid, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), glucose, HbA1C, FBC, blood urea nitrogen, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## iii Statistical analysis

The primary endpoint efficacy analysis was an assessment of non-inferiority with respect to change from  baseline  in  serum  phosphorus  levels  at  Week  12/Final  among  the  Per-Protocol  Set.  A  Full Analysis Set (FAS) analysis was performed as a confirmatory analysis.

The secondary  endpoint  efficacy  analysis  was  an  assessment  of  the  change  from  baseline  at  Week 12/Final  in  the  following  parameters  was  analysed:  total  cholesterol,  non-HDL  cholesterol,  LDL cholesterol,  HDL  cholesterol,  triglycerides,  calcium  phosphorus  product,  and  plasma  biomarkers (CRP, uric acid, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), HbA1C, random blood glucose).

Comparisons between treatment groups were assessed using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test and changes within treatment groups was assessed using Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. All these analyses were  tested  at  the  alpha  =  0.05  (2-tailed)  level  of  significance  unless  otherwise  specified.  p-values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.

All treatment emergent AEs (TAEs)/SAEs and those related to study treatment were summarised and tabulated by treatment group for each system organ class and preferred term.

## iv. Study Population

A total  of  253  patients  were  screened  for  this  study,  143  of  whom  were  randomised  to  sevelamer (n=97) or calcium (n=46) in a 2:1 ratio following the washout period (safety set). The full analysis set (FAS)  consisted  of  139  patients  who  received  study  medication  and  had  at  least  one  post-baseline serum  phosphorus  assessment  (sevelamer,  n=95;  calcium,  n=44).  Thirty-six  patients  were  excluded from the Per Protocol set, which consisted of 103 patients (sevelamer, n=72; calcium, n=31). The main reasons for exclusion were poor compliance (&lt;70%) (sevelamer, n=15, calcium, n=10) and less than 3 weeks on treatment (sevelamer, n=7, calcium, n=3). The study was completed by 76% of patients in the  sevelamer  group  (n=74)  and  65%  of  patients  in  the  calcium  group  (n=30).  AEs  were  the  main reason  for  premature  withdrawal  from  the  study  (18%  of  sevelamer-treated  patients  and  28%  of calcium-treated patients).

## Results

## Patient exposure and Demographics

A total of 253 patients were enrolled. 110 patients failed screening or washout. 143  patients  were  randomised  to  study  treatment  in  a  2:1  fashion:  97  patients  received  sevelamer hydrochloride (SG) and 46 patients received calcium acetate (CG).

Of the 143 patients in the Safety Set (93 male, 50 female) the mean age was 54.4 years (range 19 to 91 years). Most patients were Caucasian (90%), with Blacks (2%), and Asians (5%) and Others (3%) comprising the remainder. 10% were smokers, 22% had diabetes and 84% reported hypertension at baseline. Baseline characteristics did not differ between the groups. All patients were on a phosphatebinder before study entry. Concomitant medication was similar in both groups.

The  study  was  completed  by  104  patients,  while  39  patients  discontinued  the  study  because  of following reasons: adverse event (30), non-compliance (1), withdrew consent (1), other reasons (7).

## Efficacy

The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed in the Per Protocol Set.  The mean serum phosphorus content  at  baseline  was  7.48  mg/dL  (2.40  mmol/L)  in  the  sevelamer  group  and  7.29  mg/dL (2.34 mmol/L) in the calcium group. At week 12/final the values were 5.86 mg/dL (1.88 mmol/L) in the  sevelamer  group  and  5.48  mg/dL  (1.76  mmol/L)  in  the  calcium  group,  which  represented statistically  significant  change  (p&lt;0.001)  from  baseline  of  -1.61  mg/dL  (-0.52  mmol/L)  and  1.81  mg/dL  (-0.58  mmol/L),  respectively.  The  difference  in  mean  change  (difference=sevelamer-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

calcium) was 0.197 mg/dL (0.061 mmol/L) with an upper 97.5% confidence bound of 0.741 mg/dL (0.237  mmol/L)  thus  establishing  non-inferiority  margin  of  0.929  mg/dL  (0.3  mmol/L).  The  Full Analysis Set results were comparable.

There  was  a  statistically  significant  decrease  (p&lt;0.001)  from  baseline  to  week  12/final  in  both treatment groups for Calcium-Phosphorous product. There was no statistically significant difference between the sevelamer and calcium treatment groups at any time point for this variable.

A statistically significant decrease (p&lt;0.001) from baseline to week 12/final for total-, LDL-, and nonHDL cholesterol was observed in the sevelamer group, but not in the calcium group (full analysis set). These changes were statistically significant between treatment groups (p&lt;0.001).

For  tryglycerides  there  was  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  terms  of  percentage  change  from baseline to week 12/final in both the sevelamer and calcium groups.

The CHMP concluded that treatment for 12 weeks with sevelamer hydrochloride was non-inferior to 12 weeks treatment with calcium acetate (calcium) in reducing serum phosphorus levels. The serum phosphorus concentrations in both groups reached the K/DOQI (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines, 2003) target concentration in approximately half the patients. The magnitudes of reduction in serum phosphorus were similar to studies conducted in the HD population.

The mean changes in serum parameters are given in Table 1 below.

Lipid  abnormalities  are  common  in  peritoneal  dialysis  patients.  A  statistically  significant  decrease (p&lt; 0.001) from baseline for total-, LDL-, and non-HDL cholesterol was observed in the sevelamer group and may favour additional benefit in these patients. The changes in lipids were not seen in the calcium group.

## Clinical studies in special populations

A sub-group analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint was performed separately within the anuric and non-anuric patients.

These results were similar to those seen in total patient sample. Both treatments resulted in statistically significant decrease in serum calcium-phosphorus product from baseline to week-12/final.

## 2.2 Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

Patients received sevelamer for an average of 10.0 weeks (SG 10.3 weeks; CG 9.4 weeks; p=0.236). The median percentage compliance in the Safety Set was similar in both groups, 91.3% in the SG and 88.5% in the CG. In the Safety Set the number of patients evaluated was 97 in the SG and 46 in the CG, a 2:1 ratio giving an exposure of approximately 7000 patient days for sevelamer and 3000 patient days for calcium.

## Adverse events (AEs)

A total of 317 treatment-emergent AEs (TAEs) occurred in 108 patients during randomised treatment period. A similar percentage of patients experienced TAEs in the two treatment groups: 75 patients (77.3%) in the sevelamer group (n=97) experienced 240 adverse events, and 33 patients (71.7%) in the calcium  group  (n=46  experienced  77  adverse  events.  The  highest  frequency  of  TAEs  for  both treatment  groups  were  gastrointestinal  disorders  with  statistically  significant  higher  number  in  the sevelamer group (p = 0.003). Most of the AEs were mild to moderate in intensity.

A  total  of  107  events  were  considered  treatment  related:  80  events  in  35  patients  (36.1%)  in  the sevelamer  group  and  27  events  in  16  patients  (34.8%)  in  the  calcium  group.  The  most  frequently occurring  treatment  related  adverse  event  in  the  sevelamer  group  was  dyspepsia  (14  events  in  12 patients, 12.4%).

Thirty patients, 17/97 patients (18%) in the sevelamer group and 13/46 (28%) in the calcium group discontinued  the  study  due  to  AEs.  In  8  cases  (4  patients  in  each  group)  the  reason  was  renal transplantation.

There were 15 episodes of peritonitis reported in patients randomised to the study. Four (4) peritonitis episodes were reported as AEs and 11 as SAEs. The sevelamer hydrochloride group experienced 11

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

episodes  (8  SAEs  and  3AEs).  The  calcium  acetate  group  experienced  2  cases  (2  SAEs).  Two  (2) peritonitis episodes occurred during the washout period (1 SAE, 1 AE).

The higher number of peritonitis episodes in the Renagel treated group compared with the calcium acetate treated group remains a matter for further surveillance. At present there is no evidence of an association between Renagel use and peritonitis or any related factor in this small group of patients with peritonitis to fully explain a difference in number of cases between the two arms of the study. For that reason the MAH agree in providing prospective data on the occurrence of peritonitis.

Taking also into account that one of the peritonitis infected patient, was taking immunosuppressive drugs (tacrolimus) and also that 17 % of the patients included in the REN00304 study had previous renal transplantation, with at least two patients still on immunosuppressive drugs, the interaction with immunosuppressive medicinal products should be highlighted. In addition during the assessment no final conclusion could be drawn to the drug-drug interactions between sevelamer hydrochloride and anti-arrhythmics/anti-epileptics from the results of the REN00304 study. The MAH therefore proposed that instructions for intake of these drugs should be given in the SPC and in the Package Leaflet.

## Serious adverse events(SAEs) and deaths

During the study 31 SAEs occurred in 24 patients; 26 SAEs for 19 patients (19.6%) in the sevelamer group  and  5  SAEs  for  5  patients  (10.9%)  in  the  calcium  group.  The  most  frequently  occurring treatment-emergent SAE was peritonitis (8 events in 8 patients in the sevelamer group and 2 events in 2 patients in the calcium group). Six AEs of severe intensity occurred in 2 patients in the sevelamer group and 6 events occurring in 3 patients in the calcium group were considered related to study drug.

Two patients  died  during  the  study.  Both  deaths  were  assessed  as  not  related  to  study  drug  by  the investigator.  One  patient  in  the  calcium  group  died  in  a  road  traffic  accident  11  days  after  starting study drug. One patient in the sevelamer group died of unknown reason 6 weeks after starting study drug.  An autopsy was not performed and the cause of death remained unknown. Cardiac arrest was suspected.

The CHMP considered that the number of adverse events and the number of patients who had AEs differ  between  the  study  groups.  AEs  which  were  considered  treatment  related  differ  between  the groups.  A  higher  percentage  of  patients  on  sevelamer  experienced  gastrointestinal  treatment-related events, which is consistent with results from previous studies with sevelamer. However, in this study the difference did not reach statistical significance.

## Laboratory findings

There was a significant decrease from baseline in bicarbonate level with sevelamer (from 22.1 mmol/L at baseline to 21.3 mmol/L at 12 weeks; p=0.003) and a significant difference in mean change between treatment  groups  (p=0.008).  However,  the  change  in  bicarbonate  in  the  sevelamer  group  was  not considered  to  be  clinically  significant  and  metabolic  acidosis  was  reported  in  just  one  sevelamer treated patient. The worsening of metabolic acidosis is already mentioned in the SPC section 4.4 for haemodialysis  patients.  The  MAH  was  requested  to  discuss  if  there  was  a  need  for  additional  risk minimisation measures for the peritoneal dialysis patients.

Hypercalcaemia (i.e. albumin-adjusted serum calcium ≥ 11.0 mg/dL) was experienced by significant more patients in the calcium group compared with the sevelamer group (p=0.001). Patients on calcium had a higher frequency of hypercalcaemia, increased blood calcium, and increased calcium phosphorus product .These events may be risk factors for development of tissue calcifications.

## Safety in special populations

A sub-group analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint was performed separately within the anuric (N 27) and non-anuric (N 112) patients. The safety results were similar to those seen in total patient sample.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There  were  not  data  in  this  clinical  trial  in  pregnant  or  lactating  women,  patients  with  hepatic impairment  or  cardiac  impairment,  immunocompromised  patients  and  populations  with  genetic polymorphism will be provided if applicable. The MAH is committing to provide a safety summary of the complete clinical trials and post authorisation data for Renagel to date in the haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis indications.

## 3 Pharmacovigilance

## 3.1 Risk Management Plan

A Risk Management Plan (RMP) was not submitted with the initial variation application but it was requested with the Request for Supplementary Information in November 2006. The MAH has then provided a Risk Management Plan which was assessed.

The  current  Renagel  SPC  reflects  this  established  safety  profile  and  covers  all  important  risks identified until now. The important unidentified potential risks captured as adverse effects which will be additionally observed in patients treated with Renagel can be evaluated in the context of established Pharmacovigilance  practice.  The  main  new  issues  identified  are  relevant  to  reported  cases  of peritonitis and as well as the functioning of the current surveillance systems.

In the revised RMP the MAH should provide a summary table of planned pharmacovigilance actions for each safety concern. Where no action beyond routine pharmacovigilance is planned, it should be fully justified. The evaluation of the need for risk minimisation activities should list all safety concerns with discussions whether routine (i.e. changes to the Product Information) risk minimisation activities will be sufficient or whether additional risk minimisation activities (e.g. educational material or training programmes for prescribers, pharmacists and patients, restricted access programmes) will be required.

Identified and potential risks including gastrointestinal ADRs such as intestinal obstruction, and ileus, vitamin deficiency, increased serum chloride levels, worsening of acidosis, hypothyroidism should be discussed in the revised RMP.  Whether these risks are similar in HD and PD patients should also be discussed.

In the updated RMP requested by the CHMP the MAH has agreed to revise the Pharmacovigilance Plan and re-evaluate the Need for Risk Minimisation Activities.

More  specifically  there  will  be  increased  monitoring  of  peritonitis  and  provision  of  additional information material for patients and health care professionals including risk factors and precautions against infection. The MAH will review the collected data from the prospective registry and they will update  the  RMP  based  on  the  review.  In  addition  there  will  be  evaluation  of  the  need  for  risk minimisation activities and any planned pharmacovigilance actions for any safety concerns.

The  details  of  important  identified  and  potential  risks  including  gastrointestinal  ADRs  such  as intestinal  obstruction,  and  ileus,  vitamin  deficiency,  increased  serum  chloride  levels,  worsening  of acidosis, hypothyroidism will be discussed including clarification on whether these risks are similar in HD and PD patients which will also be submitted.

The  discussion  on  co-morbidities  such  as  diabetes,  hypertension,  hyperlipidemia,  heart  failure,  and chronic lung diseases will be added and as well as the epidemiology of identified or potential risks in the target population will be studied.

The  ongoing  safety  concerns  will  be  closely  monitored  and  information  on  special  patient  groups, important  missing  information,  and  the  impact  of  identified  and  potential  risk  of  Renagel  will  be added. In addition the present off-label use will be estimated and provided.

## 4 Overall Scientific Discussion and Benefit/Risk Assessment

In kidney failure patients, when GFR drops below 25% of normal, compensatory increases in renal excretion  are  no  longer  sufficient  to  maintain  normal  serum  phosphorus  level.  Control  of  serum phosphorus  is  critical  to  prevent  metastatic  calcification,  a  condition  where  calcium  and  phosphate precipitate  into  soft  tissues,  often  in  association  with  a  high  calcium  phosphorus  product.  Elevated serum  phosphorus  and  calcium  phosphorus  product  are  associated  with  increased  risk  of  death  in dialysis patients.

Patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis are usually placed on phosphorus-restricted diets in attempt to control serum phosphorus levels. Dietary phosphorus restriction is usually insufficient to control serum phosphorus levels, and phosphate binders are also used to decrease absorption of dietary phosphorus. Sevelamer (Renagel) is a non absorbable phosphate-binding polymer, approved for the control of serum phosphorus in adult patients on haemodialysis.

The MAH has now conducted one clinical study, protocol REN00304 in peritoneal dialysis patients. The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  sevelamer  hydrochloride compared with calcium acetate in peritoneal dialysis patients.

Regarding the efficacy, it is concluded that treatment for 12 weeks with sevelamer hydrochloride was non-inferior to the 12-week treatment with calcium acetate (calcium) in reducing serum phosphorus levels.  The  serum  phosphorus  concentrations  in  both  groups  reached  the  K/DOQI  guideline  target concentration in approximately half the patients. The magnitudes of reduction in serum phosphorus were similar to studies conducted in the HD population.

Regarding the safety of the product, the clinical trial REN00304 conducted with Renagel in the PD population has shown that the product is well tolerated in general in this population. The safety profile of Renagel in this new population is consistent with patients' underlying renal disease and with the known safety profile for Renagel. No newly important and potential risks have been identified in this population. Although a higher percentage of patients on sevelamer experienced gastrointestinal events, that  is  consistent  with  results  from  previous  studies  with  the  product.  The  higher  prevalence  of peritonitis  in  the  Renagel  treated  group  compared  with  the  calcium-acetate  treated  group  and compared with reported prevalence of peritonitis episodes in the literature remains a matter for further surveillance. At present there is no evidence of an association between Renagel use and peritonitis. Therefore, the MAH has proposed modifications to the original risk minimization strategy to follow up the reported cases by the collection of additional information at sites and provide it in the PSURs every six months for the period of two years after approval of this variation.

Because failure of a transplant kidney is an increasing reason for end-stage renal disease necessitating dialysis,  the  CHMP  proposed  that  the  interactions  with  tacrolimus  should  also  be  indicated  in  the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC). In addition, cyclosporine A, tacrolimus and mycophenolate  mofetil  should  be  mentioned  also  in  the  Package  Leaflet  because  up  to  50  %  of patients still continue to take immunosuppressive drugs to maintain residual renal function when on dialysis.

The  CHMP  suggested  that  drug-drug  interactions  between  sevelamer  hydrochloride  and  antiarrhythmics/anti-epileptics could not be accurately judged from the results of the REN00304 study. Therefore instructions for intake of these drugs should be given in the SPC and in the Package Leaflet.

The Risk Management Plan will be revised and re-submitted to the CHMP for evaluation. The MAH has accepted this commitment.

The CHMP concluded that the overall benefit-risk is favourable for the control of hyperphosphatemia in adult patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and agreed to the extension of the indication of Renagel as applied by the MAH
