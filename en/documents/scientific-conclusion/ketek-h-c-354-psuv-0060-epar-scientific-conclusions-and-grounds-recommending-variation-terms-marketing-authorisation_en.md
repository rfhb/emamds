## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Ketek, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

The  assessment  of  this  PSUR  revealed  that  the  use  of  telithromycin  was  still  associated  with  a considerable number of visual adverse events such as blurred vision, visual impairment, diplopia and accommodation disorders, that may be both severe and of sudden onset.

The PRAC agreed to recommend that the paragraphs in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC referring to visual disturbances should be made clearer concerning the risk for severe and sudden visual reactions. In  addition,  the  PRAC  recommended  the  addition  of  a  sentence  concerning  the  interaction  between telithromycin and sotalol in section 4.5 of the SmPC, and the addition of gamma-glutamyl transferase increase to the table in section 4.8, within the SOC 'Hepatobiliary disorders', grouped under 'Increase in liver enzymes' and with a frequency of 'common'. The PL was amended accordingly. Based on the review on data on safety and efficacy,  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  telithromycin  in  the approved indications remains favourable. The  product  has  been  approved  since  2001.  The  safety  profile  is  presently  considered  to  be  more established and it is therefore recommended that the PSUR periodicity should be changed from 1 year to 2 years. The next PSUR should be submitted in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c (7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Ketek, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance telithromycin is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information. The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied. Medicinal product no longer authorised
