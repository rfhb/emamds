## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for trametinib, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on AV block from clinical trials, the literature, spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, positive de-challenge cases and that there are known cardiac ADRs listed in the SmPC for trametinib, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between trametinib and AV block is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing trametinib should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for trametinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing trametinib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
