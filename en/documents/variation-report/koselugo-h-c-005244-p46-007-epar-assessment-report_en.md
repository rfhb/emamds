## 1. Introduction

On July 2024, the MAH submitted a paediatric study for selumetinib (Koselugo), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

Study D1346C00015 is a Phase I, Single-Arm, Sequential Study to Evaluate the Effect of Food on the Gastrointestinal  Tolerability  and  Pharmacokinetics  of  Selumetinib  after  Multiple  Doses  in  Adolescent Children with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) Related Plexiform Neurofibromas (PN) conducted by the MAH AstraZeneca to fulfil an FDA Post-Marketing Requirement (PMR 3806-3), and as previously agreed with the PDCO Study 15 used to fulfil PIP Quality Measure 2. The Clinical Study Report for the DCO1 was submitted to the Agency to support the removal of the fasting restriction (EMEA/H/C/005244/II/0013) for which EMA Decision was granted on 19 Oct 23. The MAH AstraZeneca submitted Study D1346C00015 CSR for DCO2, which includes a safety update to fulfil Art.46 requirements.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Study D1346C00015 'A Phase I, Single-Arm, Sequential Study to Evaluate the Effect of Food on the Gastrointestinal Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Selumetinib after Multiple Doses in Adolescent Children with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) Related Plexiform Neurofibromas (PN)'

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

In Study D1346C00015 (Study 15), the commercially representative selumetinib capsules were used to support submission of clinical pharmacology program.

## Assessor's comment:

No complementary biopharmaceutical investigation is needed. The drug products used in the dedicated food effect study 15 (10 and 25 mg capsules) are already approved and deemed suitable for the claimed dosing scheme.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Pharmacokinetics

Selumetinib  is  used  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  symptomatic,  inoperable  plexiform neurofibromas (PN) in paediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) aged 3 years and above.

The recommended dose of selumetinib is 25 mg/m 2  individualised based on body surface area (BSA) and taken orally twice daily (BID). Dosing is rounded to the nearest achievable 5 mg or 10 mg dose (up to a maximum single dose of 50 mg for BSA ≥ 1.9 m 2 ). Selumetinib is not recommended in patients with a BSA &lt; 0.55 m 2 .

The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of selumetinib were sufficiently characterized in the initial MAA. Please refer to section 5.2 of the current SmPC.

In the context of this PAM procedure EMEA/H/C/5244/P46, the Applicant submitted an addendum to CSR of Study D1346C00015 (Study 15): A Phase I, single-Arm, sequential study to evaluate the effect of food on the gastrointestinal tolerability and PK of selumetinib after multiple doses in adolescent children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) Related Plexiform Neurofibromas (PN).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This updated report included new safety data for patients who continued the treatment until the final data cut-off (DCO; 24 April 2023) in the extension period T2 after the primary DCO (06 April 2022). There is no PK analysis conducted at this final DCO, and therefore, there are no updates to the PK data since the primary analysis.

It is important to underline that PK results of Study 15 were already submitted and assessed in type II variation EMEA/H/C/005244/II/0013. Within this variation, it was concluded that, taking into account both  results  from  the  formal  and  pivotal  food  effect  Study  15  in  the  target  adolescent  patients  (a reduction in steady state AUC0-12h,ss and Cmax by in average 8% and 24% respectively, when administered with a low-fat meal compared with the fasted state) and the supportive findings from the population approach (fed state reduced AUC12hss of selumetinib and the N-desmethyl metabolite by less than 30%), the proposal to remove the fasting restriction from the product information (section 4.2 of the SmPC) and addition of PK results from Study 15 (section 5.2) were agreed.

No new data regarding the food effect of  selumetinib  are  submitted  and  no  change  to  the  product information is proposed within the current PAM under review.

Title:A  Phase I,  Single-Arm, Sequential Study to Evaluate the Effect of Food on the Gastrointestinal Tolerability  and  Pharmacokinetics  of  Selumetinib  after  Multiple  Doses  in  Adolescent  Children  with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) Related Plexiform Neurofibromas (PN)

## Summary of the study description following addendum of the CSR

This  is  a  clinical  study  report  (CSR)  addendum  for  Study  D1346C00015.    Study  D1346C00015  was initiated in adolescent children, aged ≥ 12 and &lt; 18 years with neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) -related symptomatic inoperable plexiform neurofibroma (PN), to evaluate the effect of a low-fat meal on steady state selumetinib pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure; to assess the effect on gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability when selumetinib is dosed under fed and fasted conditions; and, potentially, to confirm an appropriate dosing recommendation of selumetinib with a low-fat meal that maintained efficacy with acceptable safety and tolerability.

A Data Review Committee (DRC) reviewed the PK and safety data from treatment period 1 (T1) cycle 1 (C1) and treatment period 2 (T2) C1 to determine whether treatment period 3 (T3) was to be initiated, should a significant reduction in PK exposure have been observed when selumetinib was given with a low-fat meal compared to the fasted state; T3 was deemed not necessary and was not initiated. The T2 extension period continued until the final data cut-off (DCO; 24 April 2023), and included new data for participants who continued study treatment in the T2 extension period after the primary DCO (06 April 2022).

## Objective

The primary analysis of the primary PK and safety endpoints for this study compared T1 C1 (fed) with T2  C1  (fasted)  and  included  the  comparison  of  GI  tolerability  in  the  fed  and  fasted  states;  the  T2 extension period was not included in this comparison. The new safety data reported in this clinical study report (CSR) addendum are for participants who remained in the T2 extension period after the primary

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

DCO, to further assess the safety profile of selumetinib administered in adolescent children with NF1related PN in the fasted state.

## Study design

This was a Phase I, single arm, multiple dose, uncontrolled, sequential, two or three period study in adolescent children aged ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years at study entry with a clinical diagnosis of NF1 -related PN.

The study was designed to evaluate the steady state systemic exposure and safety (especially GI toxicity) of selumetinib 25 mg/m 2  bid given with a low-fat meal versus the same dose given in a fasted state.

This  sequential  study  consisted  of  a  screening  period  lasting  up  to  28  days,  a  28  day  (one  cycle) treatment period (T1) in a fed state, a 7 day washout period (for PK and safety) that could be extended up to 21 days at the discretion of the Investigator if GI related adverse events (AEs) had not recovered or returned to baseline, a further 28 day (one cycle) treatment period (T2) in a fasted state, and an extension to T2 which continued until the final DCO (24 April 2023).

Prior to the start of dosing in T2, the Investigator reviewed all AEs, vital signs, laboratory assessments and concomitant medications to confirm that the participant was able to continue in the study.

For at least 14 days during screening and throughout T1 C1 and T2 C1, participants completed a diary on a daily basis to confirm that selumetinib was taken according to the instructions and to rate GI symptoms (bowel movements, vomiting, nausea). In addition, at the end of each cycle, participants were asked to rate the convenience of taking selumetinib with a low-fat meal versus the same dose given in a fasted state; at the end of the study, participants were asked to indicate how they preferred taking selumetinib.

A third treatment period (T3) was planned to be added if a significant reduction in PK exposure was observed when selumetinib was given with a low-fat meal compared to the fasted; T3 was to evaluate the PK and safety of an adjusted dose of selumetinib when given with a low-fat meal. Based on a DRC assessment of data from T1 and T2, T3 was not initiated.

The final DCO (24 April 2023) included new data for participants who continued treatment in the T2 extension period after the primary DCO (06 April 2022). In addition, there were minor updates to the database for participants treated in T1 C1 plus the washout period and T2 C1; these updates are also reported in this CSR addendum.

Approximately 20 adolescent children aged ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of NF1 -related PN  were  planned  to  be  enrolled  to  ensure  16  evaluable  participants  completing  T2.  A  total  of  25 participants  were  actually  enrolled  (aged  between  12  and  17  years),  of  whom  24  participants  were evaluable for safety (defined as all participants who received at least one dose of selumetinib) and 24 participants were included in the PK Analysis Set (defined as all participants who received at least one dose of selumetinib and who had at least one post-dose quantifiable plasma concentration and did not have any important protocol deviations that would affect the PK analysis). One participant screen failed due to inclusion criterion 6 (participants must have a bod y surface area [BSA] ≥ 1.3 and ≤ 2.5 m 2 ); the participant's BSA was measured as 1.09 m 2 .

## Duration of Treatment

This  sequential  study  consisted  of  a  screening  period  lasting  up  to  28  days,  a  28  day  (one  cycle) treatment period (T1) in a fed state, a 7 day washout period (for PK and safety) that could be extended up to 21 days at the discretion of the Investigator if GI related AEs had not resolved or returned to baseline, a further 28 day (one cycle) treatment period (T2) in a fasted state, an extension to T2 which continued until results from the primary analysis were available, and a recommendation had been made as to whether a third treatment period (T3) in a fed state was required.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The median total treatment duration (intended) and the median actual treatment duration (total minus treatment interruptions) were equal for both T1 C1 (28 days) and T2 C1 (29 days). Median relative dose intensity during both T1 C1 and T2 C1 was 100%.

In  total,  23  participants  had  completed  the  study  at  the  addendum  DCO (24 April 2023). Since the primary  analysis,  median  total  (intended)  treatment  exposure  in  T2  C1  plus  extension  period  had increased  from  91.5  to  417.5  days  and  median  actual  treatment  exposure  (total  minus  treatment interruptions) had increased from 80.0 to 412.0 days.

## Statistical Methods

All statistical analyses and production of tables, figures and listings were performed using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) ®  Version 9.4.

There was no PK analysis conducted at the final DCO. The safety analyses were based on the Safety Analysis Set. Safety data were analysed based on summary statistics.

## Efficacy results

There were no efficacy endpoints in this study.

## Safety results

## Exposure

At the time of the primary CSR DCO (06 April 2022), 25 participants were enrolled into the study and 24  participants  received  treatment.  No  additional  participants  were  enrolled  or  received  treatment between the primary CSR DCO and the final CSR addendum DCO (24 April 2023).

- Treatment Period 1 (Cycle 1 Plus Washout Period): Since the primary analysis, there were no updates to the duration of exposure data for participants during T1 (Section 9 and see Table 14.3.1.2).
- Treatment Period 2 (Cycle 1 Plus Extension Period): The duration of exposure for participants during T2 is presented in Table 5. Since the primary analysis, median total (intended) treatment exposure had increased from 91.5 to 417.5 days and median actual treatment exposure had increased from 80.0 to 412.0 days in the T2 C1 plus extension period.

## Adverse events

For information on AEs in any category during T1 C1, T2 C1, T1 C1 plus washout period, and T2 C1 plus extension period at the time of the primary analysis, see Section 12.2.1 of the primary CSR.

- Treatment Period 1 (Cycle 1 Plus Washout Period)

Since the primary analysis, the only updated data for AEs in any category for T1 was an increase in the number of participants with AESIs, from 15 participants (62.5%) to 16 participants (66.7%).

- Treatment Period 2 (Cycle 1 Plus Extension Period)

Adverse events were reported for 23 participants during the T2 extension period; 4 additional participants since the primary analysis (Table 7). Of these, 18 participants had an AE assessed by the Investigator to  be  possibly  related  to  study  treatment;  5  additional  participants  since  the  primary  analysis.  Six participants had an AE of Grade 3 or higher during the T2 extension period; 5 additional participants since the primary analysis, with one additional participant reporting an AE of Grade 3 or higher that was possibly related to study treatment.

- Treatment Period 1 (Cycle 1 Plus Washout Period)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since the primary analysis, the following AE data for participants in T1 has been updated: One additional participant was reported with acne, increasing from one participant (4.2%) to 2 participants (8.3%). This increased the number of participants with AEs in the SOC of Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders from 16 participants (66.7%) to 17 participants (70.8%).

- Treatment Period 2 (Cycle 1 Plus Extension Period)

The SOCs that had a &gt; 20% increase in participants during the T2 extension period since the primary analysis were:

- Infections and Infestations (from 7 participants [29.2%] to 14 participants [58.3%]; increase of 29.1%);
- Nervous System Disorders (from 2 participants [8.3%] to 8 participants [33.3%]; increase of 25.0%);
- Gastrointestinal Disorders (from 9 participants [37.5%] to 14 participants [58.3%]; increase of 20.8%); and
- Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (from 9 participants [37.5%] to 14 participants [58.3%]; increase of 20.8%).

The  most  common  AEs  (occurring  in  ≥  25%  of  participants  during  the  T2  extension  perio d)  were: paronychia (8 participants [33.3%]), COVID-19 (7 participants [29.2%]), and dermatitis acneiform and vomiting (6 participants [25.0%] each.

The AEs that had a &gt; 10% increase in participants during the T2 extension period since the primary analysis were:

- Paronychia (from 2 participants [8.3%] to 8 participants [33.3%]; increase of 25.0%);
- Dry skin (from one participant [4.2%] to 5 participants [20.8%]; increase of 16.6%);
- Headache (from one participant [4.2%] to 5 participants [20.8%]; increase of 16.6%); and
- Blood CPK increased (from 2 participants [8.3%] to 5 participants [20.8%]; increase of 12.5%).

## Treatment related adverse events

For information on AEs by relation to study treatment during T1 C1, T2 C1, T1 C1 plus washout period, and T2 C1 plus extension period at the time of the primary analysis, see Section 12.2.3 of the primary CSR.

▪ Treatment Period 1 (Cycle 1 Plus Washout Period)

Since the primary analysis, the following data for AEs assessed by the Investigator as possibly related to study treatment for participants in T1 has been updated (Section 9):

One additional participant was reported with acne, increasing from one participant (4.2%) to 2 participants (8.3%). This increased the number of participants with AEs assessed by the Investigator as possibly related to study treatment in the SOC of Skin and

Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders from 14 participants (58.3%) to 15 participants (62.5%).

At the time of the primary analysis, data from the study D1346C00015 demonstrated that consumption of  a  low-fat  meal  with  administration  of  selumetinib  capsules,  compared  with  selumetinib  capsules administered  in  the  fasted  state,  showed  no  difference  in  the  occurrence  and/or  management  of ggastrointrsinal adverse events, or any other AEs.

Overall, since the primary analysis, the one additional year of selumetinib exposure for participants remaining in the T2 extension period led to the following safety findings:

- The reported AEs remained consistent with those reported at the primary analysis and the known safety profile of selumetinib, with minimal changes in the AE categories.
- The gastrointestinal AEs reported were consistent with those reported at the primary analysis. There were no clinically important changes noted in laboratory values or vital signs in participants throughout the study.
