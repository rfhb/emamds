## Information on Paediatric requirements

## Onglyza

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) [P/97/2011] on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP for saxagliptin (P/97/2011) was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Komboglyze

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision on the granting of a product-specific waiver for saxagliptin/metformin (P/240/2009).

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Saxagliptin is a selective, orally administered, xanthine-based inhibitor of dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4). The recommended therapeutic dose of saxagliptin is 5 mg once daily. Like other DPP-4 inhibitors, saxagliptin lowers blood glucose by extending the half-life of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which is secreted  in  response  to  a  meal.  GLP-1  lowers  blood  glucose  by  augmenting  the  glucose-stimulated insulin  release  and  limiting  glucagon  secretion  to  slow  gastric  emptying  and  to  induce  satiety. Therefore, saxagliptin predominately affects postprandial glycaemic excursions. The advantages of DPP4 inhibitors over other established antidiabetic medications include the low risk of hypoglycaemia and lack of weight gain.

Onglyza (saxagliptin) and Komboglyze (saxagliptin/metformin) were approved throughout the European Union on 1 October 2009 and 24 November 2011, respectively.

The MAH proposed to extend the indication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as triple combination (saxagliptin in combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea (SU)).

The clinical program to support the addition of the 'in combination with metformin and a SU' indication was  developed  in  accordance  with  the  'Notes  for  Guidance  on  Clinical  Investigations  of  Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus' (CPMP/EWP/1080/00).

The present worksharing application for Onglyza and Komboglyze  is supported by study D1680L00006, a 24-week, multicentre, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3b study, which  assessed  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  saxagliptin  5  mg  as  an  adjunct  to  metformin  plus  SU  in improving  glycaemic  control  in  adult  subjects  with  T2DM.  In  study  D1680L00006,  saxagliptin  and metformin were administered as separate tablets rather than as the FDC product.

## 2.2. Clinical Efficacy aspects

## 2.2.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

The main study of this application is study D1680L00006.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Study design

Study  D1680L00006  was  a  24-week,  multicenter,  randomized,  parallel-group,  double-blind,  placebocontrolled Phase 3b study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin compared with placebo as add-on  therapy  to  a  stable  metformin  dose  plus  a  stable  SU  dose  in  subjects  with  T2DM  who  have inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥7% and ≤10%). Subjects were to be on a stable combined dose of metformin extended release (XR) or immediate release (IR) (at maximum tolerated dose [MTD], with minimum dose for enrolment being 1500 mg) plus SU (gliclazide, gliclazide modified release [MR], or glimepiride  at  MTD  with  minimum  dose  for  enrolment  being  ≥50%  of  the  maximum  recommended dose) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrolment.

The protocol was amended following enrolment of the first subjects to widen the inclusion and exclusion criteria by allowing use of any SU (including glibenclamide) in combination with metformin for at least 8 weeks prior to enrolment. Following amendment, enrolled subjects were to be on a stable combined dose of metformin XR or IR (at MTD, with minimum dose for enrolment being 1500 mg) plus SU (at MTD, with minimum dose for enrolment being ≥50% of the maximum recommended dose) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrolment.

During the enrolment/screening and 24-week double-blind treatment periods, subjects continued their own (open-label) metformin plus SU at the doses ascertained during enrolment. Metformin and SU were not  supplied  as  part  of  the  investigational  products  and,  thus,  were  not  subject  to  the  treatment compliance check that was performed for saxagliptin and placebo.

Subjects  were  randomized  (1:1)  to  either  saxagliptin  5  mg  or  matching  placebo  once  daily  by  oral administration. The metformin and SU doses were to remain constant during the 24-week double-blind treatment period.

## Study population

The population of Study D1680L00006 consisted of male and female subjects with T2DM, aged between 25 and 83 years of age (inclusive), with inadequate glycaemic control (defined as HbA1c levels ≥7.0% and ≤10.0%) and were on a stable combined dose of metformin plus SU for at least 8 weeks prior to enrolment.

## Endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in HbA1c level from baseline until Week 24.

Secondary endpoints assessed at week 24 were:

- Change in PPG (measured 2 hours after breakfast) from baseline to Week 24;
- Change from baseline in FPG;
- Proportion of subjects achieving a therapeutic glycaemic response (defined as HbA1c &lt; 7%);

Other efficacy endpoints were the changes from baseline to week 24 for TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG; Subject-reported endpoints using the EQ-5D questionnaire; Change in insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon from baseline to Week 24.

## Statistical analysis

## Sample size

To  demonstrate  a  significant  difference  between  saxagliptin  and  placebo-as  add-on  therapy  to  the combination of metformin plus SU-in the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24, a total of 240

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects  randomised  and  treated  (120  subjects  per  treatment  group)  was  needed  to  provide approximately 80% power at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming a true difference of 0.40% and a standard deviation (SD) of 1.1%.

Assuming a 4% drop-out rate of subjects who were randomised but did not return for a post-baseline assessment, a total of 250 subjects was required for randomisation. Assuming a 10% screening failure rate for subjects who were consented and enrolled but were not eligible for randomisation, a total of 275 subjects was planned for enrolment/screening.

## Primary endpoint

The primary efficacy analysis was to compare the difference between saxagliptin 5 mg once daily as add-on  therapy  to  metformin  plus  SU  versus  placebo  as  add-on  therapy  to  metformin  plus  SU,  in subjects with T2DM, as determined by the change in HbA1c levels from baseline to Week 24.

The primary analysis for efficacy variables was based on the Full Analysis set, which included subjects who took at least 1 dose of investigational product and had both baseline and post-baseline efficacy data. For this study, a sensitivity analysis was performed for the Per Protocol (PP) analysis set since the pre-defined  criterion  of  &gt;10%  of  subjects  in  either  treatment  group  of  the  Full  Analysis  set  having significant deviations from the protocol (as defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan [SAP]) was met.

The change from baseline to Week 24 in HbA1c was analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model  with  treatment  group  and  country  as  fixed  effects  and  baseline  HbA1c  value  as  a  covariate. Missing Week 24 values were imputed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. The model was used to derive a least squares estimate of the treatment difference in the mean change from baseline with corresponding 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) and 2-sided p-value. In addition, 2sided 95% CIs for the mean change within each treatment group were calculated.

## Sequential testing methodology

A fixed-sequence test method was adopted for the overall primary efficacy variable (HbA1c change from baseline to Week 24), and the 3 secondary efficacy variables to control the Type I error rate so as not to exceed the 5% level. The fixed-sequence test method was applied to these variables in the following sequential order:

Change from baseline to Week 24 in HbA1c (or the last post-baseline measurement prior to Week 24 if no Week 24 assessment was available).

Change from baseline to Week 24 in 2-hour PPG (or the last post-baseline measurement prior to Week 24 if no Week 24 assessment was available).

Change from baseline to Week 24 in FPG (or the last post-baseline measurement prior to Week 24 if no Week 24 assessment was available).

Proportion of subjects achieving a glycaemic response defined as HbA1c &lt;7.0% was compared using a logistic regression model.

Statistical inference began with the overall primary efficacy variable. If the saxagliptin treatment group was statistically significantly superior in the change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 over the placebo group at the 5% level, then statistical inference continued with (2) in the sequence above-the first secondary efficacy variable (2-hour PPG); otherwise, statistical inference of the overall efficacy variables was stopped (any p value that follows cannot be considered as significant in this confirmatory analysis when the fixed-sequence procedure is used to control the overall Type I error rate, even if the p-value is &lt;0.05).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Similar testing was followed with the prescribed sequential order (1) to (4) as the above steps with the same decision rule at each of the variable evaluations until all 3 secondary variables were analysed or testing was interrupted at any non-significant findings at the 5% level.

## Analysis sets

The primary and secondary efficacy endpoint analyses were performed on the Full analysis set using LOCF to estimate any missing values at Week 24. The safety endpoints were analysed using the Safety analysis set. The decision to include or exclude subjects from each analysis set was performed in a blind data review prior to unblinding.

## Randomised analysis set

All subjects randomised to double-blind treatment at Week 1 (Day 0) were included in the Randomised analysis set.

## Full analysis set

The Full analysis set included all randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational product during the 24-week double-blind treatment period and who had a non missing baseline value and at least 1 post-baseline value for at least 1 efficacy parameter. The Full analysis set followed the principles of intention-to-treat in that all efficacy measures were summarised and analysed according to the treatment to which subjects were randomised, regardless of the treatment actually received.

## Per Protocol analysis set

The PP analysis set was a subset of the Full analysis set including subjects with no reasons for exclusion. These exclusions for the PP analysis set were explicitly defined in the SAP and the subjects with exclusions were identified prior to database locking. A PP analysis on the primary variable was only to be performed if &gt;10% of subjects in either treatment group of the Full analysis set have significant protocol violations or deviations. Otherwise, analysis of the primary variable was restricted to the Full analysis set.

Disposition of subjects is shown in the table above.

The study was conducted at 35 study centres in: United Kingdom (12 sites), Canada (4 sites), Australia (7 sites), India (6 sites), Korea (4 sites), and Thailand (2 sites).

Of  the  383  subjects  who  entered  the  enrolment/screening  period,  126  subjects  did  not  enter  the randomised, double-blind treatment period due to subject decision (n=11), lost to follow-up (n=1), and eligibility criteria not fulfilled (n=114). Thus, a total of 257 subjects were randomised and treated.

In table 1 the following is indicated:

- A total of 257 subjects were assigned to randomised double-blind treatment with either saxagliptin + metformin + SU (n=129) or placebo + metformin + SU (n=128).
- The proportion of subjects who completed the 24-week, double-blind, randomised treatment period was similar in the 2 treatment groups (approximately 88%).
- The  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  in  both  treatment  groups  was  worsening  of  T2DM (6.2% [n=8] in the saxagliptin group and 5.5% [n=7] in the placebo group).
- One subject (0.8%) in each treatment group withdrew due to a calculated CrCl of &lt;60 mL/min or an increase in serum creatinine of ≥44.2 μmol/L (≥0.5 mg/dL) above baseline.
- The  proportion  of  subjects  discontinuing  study  treatment  due  to  an  AE  during  double-blind treatment was in the saxagliptin group 0.8% [n=1] and in the placebo group 2.3% [n=3].

## Protocol deviations

Subjects may have more than 1 deviation.

Met Metforminr; Pla Placebo; PP Per protocol; Saxa Saxagliptin; SU Sulfonylurea

In total, 19 (15.0%) and 16 (12.5%) subjects from the saxagliptin and placebo groups, respectively, were excluded from the PP analysis set. The majority of subjects were excluded for use of a prohibited concomitant  medication  (12  [9.4%]  and  10  [7.8%]  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  and  placebo  groups, respectively),  namely  CYP3A4 inducers and/or CYP3A4/5 inhibitors. On further clarification requested from  the  applicant  by  CHMP  during  the  procedure,  an  analysis  provided  showed  the  number  of individuals with significant protocol deviations leading to exclusion from the PP population to be small when the erroneously counted CYP3A4 inhibitor/inducers/substrates are neglected. The FAS included all individuals  with  significant  protocol  deviations.  Results  of  the  FAS  and  PP  analysis  were  similar, indicating  that  the  treatment  effect  of  saxagliptin  was  robust  and  consistent  and  therefore  the remaining concern was resolved.

## Subjects analysed (analysis sets)

The analysis sets and the number of subjects in each analysis set are summarised in the table below. The Randomised analysis set comprised 257 subjects, of whom 255 (99.2%) were included in the Full analysis set, 220 (85.6%) were included in the PP analysis set, and 257 (100%) were included in the Safety analysis set. The 2 treatment groups were balanced with regard to inclusion in the respective analysis sets.

The  demographic  and  key  baseline  characteristics  were  generally  balanced  across  the  2  treatment groups. The subjects ranged in age from 25 to 83 years with a mean (SD) age of 57.0 (10.54) years. A total of 196 subjects (76.3%) were &lt;65 years of age. Of the 257 randomised and treated subjects, the majority  of  subjects  in  each  treatment  group  were  male  (62.0%  and  57.8%  in  the  saxagliptin  and placebo groups, respectively). Body weight ranged from 40 to 155 kg with a mean (SD) of 82.4 (19.86) kg and 80.3 (18.47) kg for the saxagliptin and placebo groups, respectively. The respective mean (SD) BMI was 29.4 (5.26) kg/m2 and 29.1 (4.93) kg/m2 for the saxagliptin and placebo groups.

The denominator of each % is the mumber of subjects in the Randomised amalysis set.

At the time of screening.

Entered, for example, when the subject did not consider himself or herself to belong to a specific ethmic group.

BMI Body Mass Index; Met Metformin; Pla Placebo; Saxa Saxagliptin; SD Standard deviation; SU Sulfonylurea

## Mean dose of Metformin and SU in the randomized set

In the randomized set mean baseline dose of Metformin (1957.00 mg) and of SU [Glibenclamide (15.50 mg), Gliclazide (159.63 mg), Glimepiride (5.04 mg), and Glipizide (17.78 mg)] was sufficient.

## Baseline diabetes characteristics

Baseline diabetes characteristics for the Randomised analysis set are summarised in the table below.

The  baseline  disease  characteristics  of  HbA1c,  PPG,  and  FPG  were  representative  of  subjects  with uncontrolled T2DM who have inadequate glycaemic control when treated with combination therapy with metformin  plus  SU.  The  mean  baseline  values  for  these  3  parameters  were  slightly  higher  in  the saxagliptin group compared with the placebo group.

For  HbA1c,  the  mean  (SD)  value  at  baseline  was  8.38%  (0.856%)  and  8.19%  (0.832%)  in  the saxagliptin and placebo groups, respectively. Differences in these baseline disease characteristics were accounted for in the efficacy analysis by using baseline value as a covariate in the ANCOVA analysis.

Between-group comparison significant after controlling overall alpha of the study.

Mean baseline HbA1c values were slightly higher in the saxagliptin group compared with the placebo group. The adjusted mean change from baseline to Week 24 was -0.74% for the saxagliptin group and 0.08%  for  the  placebo  group.  Based  on  the  difference  in  adjusted  mean  changes  from  baseline, treatment with saxagliptin significantly decreased HbA1c compared with placebo in the Full analysis set. The difference in adjusted mean changes between the 2 groups (saxagliptin minus placebo) was -0.66% (2-sided 95% CI, -0.86% to -0.47%; p&lt;0.0001).

Mean  HbA1c  values  over  time  during  the  24-week  double-blind  treatment  period  are  summarised graphically for the Full analysis set (LOCF) in the figure below.

In contrast with placebo for saxagliptin a reduction from baseline was observed at weeks 4, 8, 12 and progressively greater to week 16. This reduction was maintained through week 24.

More than 10% of subjects in the Full analysis set were excluded from the PP analysis set. Therefore a sensitivity  analysis  of  the  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  24  was  performed  using  the  PP analysis set (see table below) .

The results from the Full analysis set (LOCF) were confirmed in the PP analysis. Adjusted mean changes from baseline to Week 24 (LOCF) in the PP analysis were -0.70% for the saxagliptin group and -0.09% for  the  placebo  group.  The  difference  in  adjusted  mean  changes  between  the  2  groups  (saxagliptin minus placebo) was -0.61% (2-sided 95% CI, -0.82% to -0.40%; p&lt;0.0001).

## Secondary endpoints

Results for secondary endpoints were in line with those of the primary endpoint.

Treatment with saxagliptin + metformin + SU resulted in a significantly greater reduction in 2-hour PPG at Week 24 compared with placebo + metformin + SU. The difference in adjusted mean changes between the 2 groups (saxagliptin minus placebo) was -0.93 mmol/L (-16.74 mg/dL) (2-sided 95% CI, -1.77 to -0.09 mmol/L [-31.85 to -1.62 mg/dL]; p=0.0301) (see table below)

## Similar results were obtained in the Full analysis set using observed values.

Saxagliptin  +  metformin  +  SU  produced  a  numerically  greater  reduction  compared  with  placebo  + metformin + SU in FPG at Week 24 . The difference in adjusted mean changes between the 2 groups (saxagliptin minus placebo) was -0.44 mmol/L (-7.90 mg/dL) (2-sided 95% CI, -0.94 to 0.06 mmol/L [16.96 to 1.15 mg/dL]; p=0.0868).

The proportion of subjects achieving a therapeutic glycaemic response, defined as HbA1c &lt;7.0% at  Week  24 ,  was  higher  in  the  saxagliptin  group  (30.7%)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (9.4%).  The

## Other efficacy endpoints

Saxagliptin  +  metformin  +  SU  compared  with  placebo  +  metformin  +  SU  had  similar  non-clinically relevant effects on mean changes from baseline to Week 24 in fasting plasma lipids (TC, LDL, HDLC, TG) as well as on fasting levels of insulin , C-peptide , and glucagon .

The changes from baseline to Week 24 were similar in the saxagliptin and placebo groups in subjectreported health status assessed with the EQ-5D .

## 2.2.3. Discussion

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

The design of the study was considered adequate to evaluate the value of saxagliptin when added to metformin plus SU in T2DM.

The primary efficacy analysis was to compare the difference between saxagliptin 5 mg once daily as add-on  therapy  to  metformin  plus  SU  versus  placebo  as  add-on  therapy  to  metformin  plus  SU,  in subjects with T2DM, as determined by the change in HbA1c levels from baseline to Week 24.

The primary and secondary endpoints were agreed .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  general  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  seemed  adequate  and  similar  to  those  used  in  former studies in T2DM patients. The inclusion criterion of metformin dose ≥ 1500 mg/day is consistent with that used in previous studies of saxagliptin and other antidiabetic agents and is acceptable. The mean dose  of  &gt;  1800  mg  is  acceptable.  Two  forms  of  Metformin  have  been  used:  Metformin  XR  and Metformin  IR.  The  XR  formulation  is  not  approved  in  all  EU  Member  States,  as  it  was  considered somewhat less effective than the IR formulation. However, the mean dose of &gt;1800 mg was considered to  be  high  enough  by  CHMP  to  overcome  any  concern  with  possible  small  differences  due  to formulation.

There  were  no  significant  differences  between  treatment  groups  in  the  percentages  of  patients  who completed  the  study  and  the  percentage  of  withdrawals.  Also  the  reasons  for  withdrawal  were  not significantly different between the treatment groups. A relatively large group of subjects discontinued from study: 12.4% in the saxagliptin group. However nearly the same percentage discontinued in the placebo group: 11.7%. Reason for discontinuation due to worsening of T2DM (that is lack of efficacy) was 6.2 and 5.5% respectively.

The study was conducted at 35 study centres in: United Kingdom (12 sites), Canada (4 sites), Australia (7 sites), India (6 sites), Korea (4 sites), and Thailand (2 sites).

Considering the large number of sites (35) and the small number of subjects enrolled at most sites the CHMP was concerned about a possible centre effect. Consequently, the MAH has performed an analysis according  to  country  in  which  the  centres  were  located,  which  did  not  show  any  interaction  and therefore resolved the issue.

There  were  no  relevant  differences  between  treatment  groups  in  demographics  and  baseline  disease characteristics.

45% of  patients  were  white,  27%  were  from  India,  20%  from  Australia,  20%  from  UK,  19%  from Korea, 7% from Canada and 7% from Thailand.

The  mean  baseline  dose  of  metformin  and  SU  (Glibenclamide,  Gliclazide,  Glimepiride  and  Glipizide, respectively) in the randomized set was considered as sufficient by CHMP.

The  baseline  disease  characteristics  of  HbA1c,  PPG,  and  FPG  were  representative  of  subjects  with uncontrolled T2DM who have inadequate glycaemic control when treated with combination therapy with metformin plus SU. Baseline disease characteristics can be considered typical for T2DM patients.

The  mean  baseline  values  for  HbA1c,  PPG,  and  FPG  were  slightly  higher  in  the  saxagliptin  group compared with the placebo group. For HbA1c, the mean (SD) value at baseline was 8.38% (0.856%) and 8.19% (0.832%) in the saxagliptin and placebo groups, respectively. Differences in these baseline disease characteristics were accounted for in the efficacy analysis.

According to the data in table 5, the range of HbA1c was 6.60 - 10.50 %, whereas the eligibility criteria were defined as subjects with HbA1c ≥7% and ≤10% to be  randomized to receive either saxagliptin 5 mg  or  matching  placebo  once  daily  by  oral  administration  for  24  weeks.  The  applicant  provided  as explanation for this extended range that those values were obtained at visit 3, which was not used as enrolement  criterion  and  this  was  considered  by  CHMP  not  to  have  a  relevant  effect  on  the  results obtained.

Results from the FAS and PP analysis indicate that the addition of saxagliptin to metformin + SU was more effective than placebo in lowering HbA1c. The difference of -0.66% was clinically relevant.

Both  primary  and  secondary  parameters  indicate  that  the  addition  of  saxagliptin  to  T2DM  patients treated with metformin + SU was effective. Saxagliptin + metformin + SU was superior to placebo + metformin + SU in lowering HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 (adjusted mean changes of -0.74% for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the saxagliptin group and -0.08% for the placebo group, with a difference versus placebo of -0.66% [2sided 95% CI, -0.86% to -0.47%; p&lt;0.0001] for saxagliptin). The proportion of subjects achieving a therapeutic glycaemic response, defined as HbA1c &lt;7.0% at Week 24, was higher in the saxagliptin group (30.7%) than in the placebo group (9.4%).

A relatively large group of subjects discontinued from this 24 weeks study: 12.4% in the saxagliptin group  was  initially  of  concern  for  CHMP.  However  nearly  the  same  percentage  discontinued  in  the placebo  group:  11.7%.  Reason  for  discontinuation  due  to  worsening  of  T2DM  was  6.2  and  5.5% respectively,  indicating  possible  lack  of  efficacy  in  these  patients.  The  effect  on  FPG  was  not  large enough  for  continuation  but  even  in  those  subjects  there  was  still  a  considerable  placebo-corrected mean reduction in HbA1c, which was found to be satisfactory by CHMP.

## Conclusions on clinical efficacy

Saxagliptin 5 mg added to a stable dose of metformin plus SU was superior to placebo added to a stable dose of metformin plus SU in lowering HbA1c and 2-hour PPG from baseline to Week 24.

In contrast with placebo for saxagliptin a reduction in HbA1c from baseline was observed at weeks 4, 8, 12 and progressively greater to week 16. This reduction was maintained through week 24.

The adjusted mean changes were -0.74% for the saxagliptin group and -0.08% for the placebo group, with  a  difference  versus  placebo  of  -0.66%  [2-sided  95%  CI,  -0.86%  to  -0.47%;  p&lt;0.0001]  for saxagliptin).

## 2.3.2. Results

## Adverse events

Number of Subjects with at least 1 adverse event is given in the table below.

The proportion of subjects with AEs during the 24-week double-blind treatment period was lower in the saxagliptin group than the placebo group: 62.8% (n=81) in the saxagliptin group and 71.7% (n=91) in the  placebo  group.  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  treatment-related  AEs  (as  assessed  by  the investigator to have a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product)  was  higher  in  the  saxagliptin  group  than  the  placebo  group  (16.3%  and  10.2%  in  the saxagliptin  and  placebo  groups,  respectively).  There  were  no  deaths  during  the  study.  SAEs  were reported  in  a  total  of  10  subjects,  3  (2.3%)  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  7  (5.5%)  in  the placebo group. One (0.8%) subject in the saxagliptin group and 3 (2.3%) subjects in the placebo group discontinued treatment due to AEs; of these AEs, 1 in the placebo group was an SAE.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Most AEs in both treatment groups were mild or moderate in intensity. Four (3.1%) subjects in each group had AEs that were severe in intensity. In the saxagliptin group, severe AEs included an SAE of hepatitis  in  1  (0.8%)  subject  that  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  to  be  possibly  related  to  study treatment  (see  Section  8.3.2  and  Section  8.3.4.2),  an  SAE  of  lower  respiratory  tract  infection  in  1 (0.8%) subject that was not considered by the investigator to be possibly related to study treatment (see Section 8.3.2), and AEs of bursitis and carotid artery occlusion reported in 1 (0.8%) subject each, neither of which was considered by the investigator to be possibly related to study treatment. In the placebo group, severe AEs included influenza-like illness, and SAEs of cartilage injury, renal colic, and asthma reported in 1 (0.8%) subject each (also see Section 8.3.2), none of which were considered by the investigator to be possibly related to study treatment.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Deaths

No AEs with fatal outcome were reported.

## Serious adverse events

Subjects who had serious adverse events are tabulated in the table below.

A total of 10 subjects experienced SAEs during the double-blind treatment period, 3 (2.3%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 7 (5.5%) in the placebo group. In the saxagliptin group, the SAEs included lower respiratory tract infection, laryngeal cancer, and hepatitis in 1 subject each. Of these, hepatitis was considered by the investigator  to  be  possibly  related  to  study  treatment.  The  subject,  although asymptomatic, was diagnosed with hepatitis, pancreatitis, and calculus cholecystitis after the subject's end-of-study laboratory evaluations revealed elevated transaminases and total bilirubin.

In the placebo group, SAEs included influenza, osteomyelitis, squamous cell carcinoma, cartilage injury, renal colic, and asthma in 1 subject each, and arthritis and musculoskeletal stiffness in 1 subject. None of  the  SAEs  in  the  placebo  group  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  possibly  related  to treatment.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

A summary of subjects who experienced AEs that led to discontinuation from study treatment is given in the table below.

A total of 4 subjects discontinued due to AEs during the double-blind treatment period, 1 (0.8%) in the saxagliptin  group  (headache)  and  3  (2.3%)  in  the  placebo  group  (abdominal  distension,  diabetes mellitus inadequate control, and asthma). Of these AEs, the events of headache in the saxagliptin group and  abdominal  distension  in  the  placebo  group  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  possibly related to study treatment, and the event of asthma in the placebo group was an SAE.

## Adverse events of special interest

## Hypoglycaemic adverse events

Subjects self-monitored their fasting  blood  glucose  levels  (at  least  every  other  day)  and  recorded  in their  subject  diary  their  fasting  glucose  values,  any  symptoms  suggestive  of  hypoglycaemia,  and fingerstick glucose values obtained at the time of a symptomatic event. A hypoglycaemic event could be an episode with symptoms and confirmed low glucose, an episode with low glucose, or an episode with symptoms when glucose was not measured.

Hypoglycaemic AEs were classified into 3  categories:  major,  minor,  and  suggestive  events  based  on CHMP criteria.  A  hypoglycaemic  AE  was  classified  as  a  major  event  if  it  was  a  symptomatic  episode requiring external assistance due to severe impairment in consciousness or behaviour, with a plasma glucose  level  &lt;3.0  mmol/L  (54  mg/dL),  and  resulted  in  prompt  recovery  after  glucose  or  glucagon administration. A hypoglycaemic AE was classified as a minor event if it was symptomatic associated with a blood glucose level &lt;3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) and no need for assistance, or an asymptomatic plasma  glucose  measurement  &lt;3.0  mmol/L  (54  mg/dL).  Events  suggestive  of  hypoglycaemia  were events  with  symptoms  that  the  subject  experiences  as  hypoglycaemia,  where  plasma  glucose measurements were not available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total of 13 (10.1%) subjects experienced 19 AEs of hypoglycaemia in the saxagliptin group and 8 (6.3%) subjects  experienced  16  AEs  of  hypoglycaemia  in  the  placebo  group  during  the  double-blind treatment  period.  No  subject  in  either  treatment  group  experienced  an  SAE  of  hypoglycaemia.  No subject in either treatment group had a major hypoglycaemic event during the double-blind treatment period.  Of  the  19  AEs  of  hypoglycaemia  in  the  saxagliptin  group,  4  were  minor  events  and  15  were suggestive events. Of the 16 AEs of hypoglycaemia in the placebo group, 5 were minor events and 11 were suggestive events. Confirmed hypoglycaemia events were defined as symptomatic hypoglycaemia with a fingerstick glucose value of ≤2.8 mmol/L [50 mg/dL]). Two (1.6%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and none in the placebo group had confirmed hypoglycaemia events. One saxagliptin subject and 2 placebo subjects had their dose of SU down-titrated during the double-blind treatment period due to hypoglycaemic events.

Hepatic  disorders One  (0.8%)  subject  in  the  saxagliptin  group  had  an  AE  of  hepatitis.  Following repeat laboratory  testing,  the  subject  was  diagnosed  with  asymptomatic  hepatitis,  pancreatitis,  and calculus cholecystitis. The subject received no further study treatment as he had completed the study.

No  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  experienced  hepatic  disorders  during  the  double-blind  treatment period.

No subject  in  either  treatment  group  had  a lymphopaenic AE, thrombocytopaenic AE, localised oedema during the double-blind treatment period.

There  were  no  AEs  of selected  skin  disorders in  the  saxagliptin  group;  1  (0.8%)  subject  in  the placebo group had an AE of skin ulcer.

Infection-related  AEs were  observed  more  frequently  in  the  placebo  group  compared  to  the saxagliptin group. AEs in the SOC infections and infestations were reported in 34 (26.4%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and in 44 (34.4%) subjects in the placebo group. The most common infections (occurring in .2% of subjects in either treatment group) were nasopharyngitis (6.2% in the saxagliptin group and 9.4% in the placebo group), upper respiratory tract infection (4.7% in each group), urinary tract  infection  (3.1%  and  6.3%),  and  pharyngitis  (0  and  2.3%).  Based  on  the  SOC  infections  and infestations, SAEs were reported for 1 (0.8%) subject in the saxagliptin group (lower respiratory tract infection)  and  for  2  (1.6%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  (influenza  and  osteomyelitis  in  1  subject each). No infection-related AEs led to discontinuation of investigational product.

One  (0.8%)  subject  in  each  treatment  group  had  an  AE  of hypersensitivity (urticaria)  during  the double-blind treatment period

There were no AEs of fracture in the saxagliptin group; 1 subject (0.8%) in the placebo group had an AE of rib fracture.

One (0.8%) subject in the saxagliptin group had an AE of pancreatitis .  No  subjects  in  the  placebo group experienced pancreatitis during the double-blind treatment period.

One (0.8%) subject in the saxagliptin group and no subjects in the placebo group had AEs indicative of an acute cardiovascular event , that was considered to be severe and not related to study treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Laboratory findings

There were no clinically  relevant  changes  from baseline  noted  in  mean  haematology  values in  either treatment group.

There were no trends observed for either treatment group based on individual shifts from baseline for any clinical chemistry parameter, including renal function as assessed by CrCl and albumin:creatinine ratio.

Laboratory abnormalities related to liver function were present in 1 saxagliptin treated and two placebo treated subjects.

## Vital signs

There were no apparent treatment-related effects on vital signs noted in either treatment group.

## ECG abnormalities

One subject in the saxagliptin group had a clinically important ECG finding (T-wave inversion) during the double-blind treatment period that was not present at baseline; this event was adjudicated and the final  adjudication  confirmed  that  there  were  non-specific  ST-T-wave  ECG  changes  compatible  with lanoxin therapy and no clinical evidence of myocardial Infarction.

## 2.3.3. Discussion

## Discussion on clinical safety

The safety profile of saxagliptin was comparable to that of placebo. There were no unexpected adverse events. The proportion of subjects experiencing any AE was lower in the saxagliptin group compared with the placebo group (62.8% and 71.7% in the saxagliptin and placebo groups, respectively; 59.7% and 69.5%, respectively, when hypoglycaemic events were excluded).

There were no deaths during the study.

No significant differences in SAEs were observed.

The incidence of AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation was similar between the 2 treatment groups.

Although the dose of SU was sufficiently high it is notable that the incidence of hypoglycaemic events in the saxagliptin triple therapy group, while higher than in the control group, remained low.

Analysis of adverse events of special interest did not reveal unexpected adverse events. The incidence of  hypoglycaemic  AEs  was  low  in  both  treatment  groups  but  was  higher  in  the  saxagliptin  group compared with the placebo group (10.1% and 6.3%, respectively); only 2 subjects (saxagliptin group) had confirmed hypoglycaemia (symptomatic with fingerstick plasma glucose ≤2.8 mmol/L [50 mg/dL]).

There were no apparent treatment-related effects on vital signs noted in either treatment group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Conclusions on the clinical safety

The  safety  and  tolerability  profile  of  saxagliptin  +  metformin  +  SU  was  similar  to  that  of  placebo  + metformin + SU. The proportion of subjects experiencing any AE was 62.8% in the saxagliptin group and  71.7%  in  the  placebo  group.  Most  common  affected  SOCs  were  infections  and  infestations (saxagliptin  26.4%,  placebo  34.4%),  gastrointestinal  disorders  (saxagliptin  18.6%,  placebo  18.0%), nervous  system  disorders  (saxagliptin  12.4%,  placebo  5.5%),  and  musculoskeletal  and  connective tissue  disorders  (saxagliptin  10.1%,  placebo  11.7%).  Nasopharyngitis  (6.2%,  diarrhoea  (5.4  %)  and hypertension  (5.4%)  were  the  most  common  AEs  in  the  saxagliptin  group,  whereas  nasopharyngitis (9.4%),  urinary  tract  infection  (6.3%)  and  dyslipidemia  (5.5%)  were  the  most  common  AEs  in  the placebo group.

The incidence of hypoglycaemic AEs was low in both treatment groups but was higher in the saxagliptin group compared with the placebo group (10.1% and 6.3%, respectively); only 2 subjects (saxagliptin group) had confirmed hypoglycaemia (symptomatic with fingerstick plasma glucose ≤2.8 mmol/L [50 mg/dL]).

An AE of an acute cardiovascular event (carotid artery occlusion) was reported in 1 saxagliptin-treated subject. The event was judged to not be a cardiovascular event upon adjudication.

One subject in the saxagliptin group had a clinically important ECG finding (T-wave inversion) during the  double-blind  treatment  period  compatible  with  digoxin  therapy  There  were  no  other  clinically relevant  changes  in  clinical  laboratory  values,  vital  signs,  or  ECGs.  No  indications  of  renal  or  other system impairments were reported throughout the study.

Saxagliptin 5 mg administered as add-on therapy to metformin plus SU in subjects with T2DM was well tolerated with a safety profile comparable to placebo as add-on to metformin plus SU.

## 2.4. Risk management plan

Based on the current Risk Management Plans (version 2 for Onglyza, version 3 for Komboglyze) the risk management systems were considered acceptable by CHMP. Only minor updates are required to the RMP.

The MAH has agreed to include the minor updates required by CHMP to the RMP in the next RMP updates that will be submitted within three months following CHMP opinion of the current procedure, with the format and content of the updated RMP in line with the requirements of the new pharmacovigilance legislation, for which reference is made to GVP module V.

For further details of the PRAC advice see Attachment 5.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that no new pharmacovigilance activities in addition to those already being performed were needed to monitor the safety of the product.

## 2.5. Changes to the Product Information

The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed (changes highlighted as 'strike-through' and 'underlined'):

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Onglyza

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## Add-on combination therapy

Onglyza is indicated in adult patients aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control:

## as dual oral therapy in combination with

- in combination with metformin, when metformin alone, with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control.
- in combination with a sulphonylurea, when the sulphonylurea alone, with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom use of metformin is considered inappropriate.
- in combination with a thiazolidinedione, when the thiazolidinedione alone with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom use of a thiazolidinedione is considered appropriate.

## as triple oral therapy in combination with

- metformin plus a sulphonylurea when this regimen alone, with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control

in as combination therapy with insulin (with or without metformin), when this regimen alone, with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

## Add-on combination therapy

- The recommended dose of Onglyza is 5 mg once daily as add-on combination therapy with metformin, insulin, a thiazolidinedione or a sulphonylurea. Onglyza tablets must not be split or cut. When Onglyza is used in combination with insulin or a sulphonylurea, a lower dose of the insulin or sulphonylurea may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).

The safety and efficacy of saxagliptin as triple oral therapy in combination with metformin and a thiazolidinedione, or with metformin and a sulphonylurea, has not been established.

. . .

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

. . .

In  addition,  patients  should  be  alerted  to  the  risk  of  hypoglycaemia  when  Onglyza  is  used  in combination with other antidiabetic medicinal products known to cause hypoglycaemia (e.g. insulin, sulphonylureas).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

. . .

## Description of selected adverse reactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

. . .

As add-on to metformin plus a sulphonylurea: dizziness (common), fatigue (common) and flatulence (common).

## Hypoglycaemia

Adverse reactions of hypoglycaemia were based on all reports of hypoglycaemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required.

When used as add-on combination therapy with metformin plus sulphonylurea, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 10.2 % for Onglyza 5 mg and 6.3% for placebo.

When  used  as  add-on  to  insulin  (with  or  without  metformin),  the  overall  incidence  of  reported hypoglycaemia was 18.4% for Onglyza 5 mg and 19.9% for placebo.

When used as add-on combination therapy with metformin plus sulphonylurea, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 10.2 % for Onglyza 5 mg and 6.3% for placebo.

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

. . .

## Saxagliptin add-on combination therapy with metformin and sulphonylurea

A total of 257 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin (5 mg once daily) in combination with metformin plus sulphonylurea (SU) in patients with inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c ≥7% and ≤10%). Saxagliptin (n=127) provided significant improvements in HbA1c and PPG compared with the placebo (n=128).  The HbA1c change for saxagliptin compared to placebo  was -0.7% at Week 24.

## Komboglyze

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

. .l.

Komboglyze is also indicated in combination with a sulphonylurea (i.e., triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adult patients aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus when the maximally tolerated dose of both metformin and the sulphonylurea does not provide adequate glycaemic control.

## 4.3 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

. . .

For patients inadequately controlled on dual combination therapy of a sulphonylurea and metformin, or for patients switching from triple combination therapy of saxagliptin, metformin and a sulphonylurea taken as separate tablets.

The dose of Komboglyze should provide saxagliptin  2.5 mg twice daily (5 mg total daily dose), and a dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. When Komboglyze is used in combination with a sulphonylurea, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).

. . .

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

. . .

Use with medicinal products known to cause hypoglycaemia

Insulin and sulphonylureas are is known to cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or sulphonylurea may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with Komboglyze.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

- . . . In addition, patients should be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when Komboglyze is used in combination with other antidiabetic medicinal products known to cause hypoglycaemia (e.g. insulin, sulphonylureas).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

. . .

Description of selected adverse reactions

. . .

As add-on to metformin and a sulphonylurea: dizziness (common), fatigue (common) and flatulence (common).

. . .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

When used as add-on to metformin plus a sulphonylurea,  the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 10.2 % for saxagliptin 5 mg and 6.3% for placebo.

. . .

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

. . .

## Saxagliptin add-on combination therapy with metformin and sulphonylurea

A total of 257 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin (5 mg once daily) in combination with metformin plus sulphonylurea (SU) in patients with inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c ≥7% and ≤10%). Saxagliptin (n=127) provided significant improvements in HbA1c and PPG compared with the placebo (n=128).  The HbA1c change for saxagliptin compared to placebo  was -0.7% at Week 24.

## 3. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

A study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin compared with placebo as addon  therapy  to  a  stable  metformin  dose  plus  a  stable  SU  dose  in  subjects  with  T2DM  who  have inadequate  glycaemic  control  (HbA1c  ≥7%  and  ≤10%).  Study  D1680L00006  was  a  24-week, multicenter,  randomized,  parallel-group,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  Phase  3b  study  in  257 subjects.

Saxagliptin  5  mg  added  to  a  stable  dose  of  metformin  plus  SU  was  superior  to  placebo  in  lowering HbA1c and 2-hour PPG from baseline to Week 24. In contrast with placebo for saxagliptin a reduction in HbA1c  from  baseline  was  observed  at  weeks  4,  8,  12  and  progressively  greater  to  week  16.  This reduction was maintained through week 24.

The adjusted mean changes were -0.74% for the saxagliptin group and -0.08% for the placebo group, with  a  difference  versus  placebo  of  -0.66%  [2-sided  95%  CI,  -0.86%  to  -0.47%;  p&lt;0.0001]  for saxagliptin).

Secondary endpoints were in line with these results.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Uncertainties about a possible centre effect were addressed by the MAH with an analysis according to country in which the centres were located, which did not show any interaction.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

In general saxagliptin was well tolerated and there were no new unexpected adverse events.

The proportion of subjects experiencing any treatment-related AE was higher in the saxagliptin group compared  with  the  placebo  group  (16.3%  and  10.2%  in  the  saxagliptin  and  placebo  groups, respectively; 11.6% and 7.0%, respectively, when hypoglycaemic events were excluded).

There were no deaths during the study.

SAEs were reported in a total of 10 subjects: 3 (2.3%) subjects in the saxagliptin group. Of these, only 1  SAE  (hepatitis)  was  considered  to  be  possibly  related  to  saxagliptin.  One  (0.8%)  subject  in  the saxagliptin group discontinued due to an AE and 3 (2.3%) subjects in the placebo group discontinued due to an AE.

The incidence of hypoglycaemic AEs was low in both treatment groups but was higher in the saxagliptin group  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (10.1%  and  6.3%,  respectively);  two  subjects  (saxagliptin group) had confirmed hypoglycaemia (symptomatic with fingerstick plasma glucose ≤2.8 mmol/L [50 mg/dL]).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

A relatively large number of subjects discontinued from this 24 weeks study. However, discontinuation was balanced between the saxagliptin group (12.4%) and the placebo group (11.7%).

## Benefit-risk balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The effect on HbA1c of saxagliptin when added to stable doses of metformin and SU is an important benefit. The difference with placebo in change from baseline (-0.66%) is clinically relevant.

The incidence of hypoglycaemia was low in both groups, which is a benefit.

In general saxagliptin was well tolerated and there were no new unexpected adverse events.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Discussion on the benefit-risk balance

The effect of adding saxagliptin to ongoing metformin and SU on HbA1c is demonstrated. Treatment was associated with a small increase in hypoglycaemic events which can be expected. In a former study (CV181040), submitted with the MAA, adding saxagliptin to SU resulted in percentages hypoglycaemia of  14.6  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  10.1%  in  the  placebo  group.  Results  in  the  current  study  are somewhat lower.

Saxagliptin was well tolerated.

## Conclusion

The overall B/R of saxagliptin as add-on therapy to a stable metformin dose plus a stable SU dose in subjects with T2DM who have inadequate glycaemic control is positive.
