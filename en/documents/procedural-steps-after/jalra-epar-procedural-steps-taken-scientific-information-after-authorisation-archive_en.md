Based on previously available data, the use of vildagliptin in patients with CHF in NYHA class I-II has been accepted, whereas the use of vildagliptin in patients with CHF in NYHA class III-IV has not been recommended due to lack of data. The number of patients in NYHA class III treated with vildagliptin is still limited (47) and the data indicate that there were imbalances with regards to background morbidity, thus the data has to be interpreted with caution and the data are insufficient to make claims on the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin in this patient group. |

| are limited and it can be agreed that vildagliptin can be used with caution in ESRD patients. The clinical data provided in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment indicate that there is neither a loss of efficacy nor an exaggerated response to vildagliptin in this population with the proposed adjusted dose. In one of the submitted studies vildagliptin was used as add-on therapy in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment, who were mainly on an insulin based treatment (80% in the study). The results of efficacy have been presented according to baseline treatment (insulin or non-insulin therapy) and no apparent difference in outcome was observed between groups. The mean total insulin dose was only marginally changed from baseline to end of study and no apparent differences were observed between vildagliptin and placebo/comparator treated groups. The safety data has limitations due to the small size of the studies which preclude evaluation of uncommon adverse events. The inclusion of both placebo and active control, however, gives some reassurance in the evaluation. The overall adverse event pattern does not appear to be different in this population as compared to the overall type 2 diabetes population. No firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the uncommon adverse event of interest, but the data does not indicate that renally impaired patients are more prone to develop the specific adverse events identified as known or potential risks with vildagliptin treatment. In view of these data, the CHMP agreed that vildagliptin could be recommended for use in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment at a reduced dose. It also   |

Update of product information with data on liver dysfunction received by the MAH from marketed use of vildagliptin. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 20/10/2011 | 24/11/2011 | SmPC and PL | The clinical safety database for vildagliptin consists of pooled analysis of data from 38 clinical trials including more than 11,500 patients treated with vildagliptin. Furthermore, post-marketing data are available from more than 1.24 million patient years. Data from clinical trials, although not statistically significant, indicate a slightly increased risk of persistent transaminase elevation in patients treated with vildagliptin relative to the comparators. This risk is reflected in the current labeling. Following a request by the CHMP (EMA/549257/2010), the MAH has conducted an evaluation of all reports related to liver dysfunction received from marketed use of vildagliptin (including Galvus and Eucreas) since the original placing on the market. The cumulative post-marketing experience has identified seven cases consistent with a drug-related liver event and a further 15 cases where a causal association cannot be excluded. Based on this, the CHMP considered that the safety information referring to the post-marketing experience in section 4.8 should be updated to reflect this safety concern. Additionally, the MAH agreed to the CHMP request that adverse liver events should be reviewed again in future PSURs. |

C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH   |            |     | patients should be informed on the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis, that resolution has been observed after discontinuation and that treatment should not be resumed after pancreatitis has been diagnosed. Few cases of pancreatitis were reported in the clinical trials safety data base and there was no apparent imbalance between vildagliptin and comparators/placebo. In five of the cases the pancreatitis occurred in the context of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis and all the four cases in which vildagliptin was re-initiated belonged to this group. That is, all the rechallenged cases had an easily identifiable risk factor for pancreatitis present and all four rechallenges were negative. The post-marketing data presented with the current variation covers the period up to 30 April 2011. The cut-off date for the latest PSUR was 30 Nov 2010, thus the current report covers an additional time period of five months. Overall, the analysis of post-marketing events consistent with pancreatitis in vildagliptin agents revealed 42 cases of pancreatitis/acute pancreatitis and 15 cases of reported elevated lipase/amylase. The majority of reported cases had additional risk factors for pancreatitis. A warning statement on acute pancreatitis and that patients should be informed on the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis has been introduced in the product information, in line with the current warnings given for other DPP4-inhibitors.

Since then, the number of elderly patients ? 75 years treated with vildagliptin has increased. In the enlarged database, 334 patients > 75 years were exposed to vildagliptin, 295 of which are included in the main safety population and up to 187 in the efficacy populations. The majority of the patients were treated with the approved dose 50 mg bid. The submitted analyses support a similar efficacy in elderly patients compared to the younger population with respect to reduction of HbA1c and FPG. The treatment was largely weight neutral and the incidence of hypoglycaemia was low. No other safety issues compared to comparators or the younger population were identified. There are limited safety data on the use of vildagliptin in patients with moderately and severely impaired renal function at risk for higher drug exposure. Until data from ongoing studies in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment become available, the use of vildagliptin is not recommended in this population. This would also apply for   |

|         | C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH   |            |            |                 | study with the fixed dose combination of vildagliptin plus metformin in drug naïve patients with T2DM. The results of this study demonstrated that initial combination therapy with the fixed dose combination of vildagliptin plus metformin was statistically superior to that of both individual monotherapy components. Initial combination therapy is not recommended as first line treatment in treatment guidelines and is not in line with the approved indication for vildagliptin. However, the CHMP accepted that information on this study was added to section 5.1 of the SPC. A new pooled safety analysis has been performed which integrates data from these new studies and provides an updated assessment of the safety and tolerability of vildagliptin based on data from more than 11,500 patients. The increased database was also utilized to conduct an extensive analysis of the cardiovascular safety of vildagliptin. The CHMP agreed that this information is consistent with the previously submitted pooled safety data and does not signal any new, unidentified concerns. Additionally, section 4.8 of the SPC and relevant section of the Package Leaflet have been updated to include   |

| II/0002 | Update of SPC Section 4.8 and 5.1 and PL to include information on the results of 3 active-controlled long- term clinical studies. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 23/07/2009 | 21/08/2009 | SmPC and PL | During the review of the initial Marketing Authorisation application for vildagliptin, the Marketing Authorisation Holder committed to submit the results of ongoing, active- controlled, long-term, comparative studies. This included one 2-year monotherapy study, one > 2-year add-on combination therapy study with metformin, and one 1-year (24 week + 28 week extension) add-on combination therapy study with metformin. The results of these studies have now become available and are discussed in the current variation application. Furthermore, a review of the safety of vildagliptin has been performed, integrating data from the above studies of up to more than 2 years in duration as well as from additional studies. Concerning efficacy, non-inferiority to the comparators (glimepiride and pioglitazone), according to the pre- specified non-inferiority margins, was achieved in the add- on to metformin studies, but not in the monotherapy study. |

Concerning safety, vildagliptin has a hypoglycemia profile superior to that of glimepiride and similar to that of pioglitazone and metformin. Previously, signals concerning hepatic and skin safety have been identified. In the current updated safety data set, slightly higher odds of having a persistent transaminase elevation with vildagliptin were found. Concerning skin safety, the incidences of skin/vascular AEs were low and not statistically significant. No additional safety signals were seen.   |
