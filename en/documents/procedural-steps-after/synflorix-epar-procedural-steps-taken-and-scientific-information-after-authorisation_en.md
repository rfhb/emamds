Data from the long-term surveillance study conducted suggests that the introduction of Synflorix in the routine immunisation programme in 2011 (3+0 schedule) with a simultaneous catch up campaign for children younger than 5 years of age was associated with a reduction in hospital admission with IPD, clinically-defined pneumonia and radiologically-confirmed pneumonia.

Nasopharyngeal carriage showed a 92% reduction in vaccine-type (VT) - Invasive Pneumococcal Disease (IPD) in children. There was no significant evidence of replacement disease in Kenya over the study period despite of the fact that carriage prevalence of non VT pneumococci increased. Across the 13-year observation period, there was a general health trend towards a consistent reduction of admission incidence rates, particularly for malaria, malnutrition, and clinically-defined pneumonia. The study used hospital admission for diarrhoea as a control condition.

| II/0117   | Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to reflect the results from study10PN-PD-DIT- 072, a phase III, open, controlled, multi-centric study to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of Synflorix in children at an increased risk of pneumococcal infection. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. An updated RMP version 16 has also been submitted. This submission fulfils the post-authorisation measure MEA 065. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet and to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 12/10/2017   | 25/10/2018   | SmPC and PL   | Based on the submitted data, the SmPC was updated to state that the immunogenicity and safety of Synflorix were assessed in a limited number of primed or unprimed subjects with congenital or acquired asplenia, splenic dysfunction or complement deficiencies: 6 subjects 2-5 years of age and 40 subjects 6-17 years of age (Synflorix is indicated up to 5 years of age). Synflorix was shown to be immunogenic and no new safety concerns were observed in this study. In individuals with splenic dysfunction, a 3-dose schedule of Synflorix should be given as primary vaccination in infants starting vaccination before 6 months of age.   |

| II/0108   | Update of sections 4.2 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to add information obtained from two clinical studies in subjects at risk for pneumococcal infections (study 10PN-PD-DIT-034 and study 10PN- PD-DIT-064). The package leaflet was amended accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to make consequential changes to the RMP and to change the final due date of a post-marketing surveillance study. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 26/01/2017   | 03/10/2017   | SmPC and PL   | Study 10PN-PD-DIT-034 assessed the safety and immunogenicity of Synflorix in children with increased risk for pneumococcal infections, i.e. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected or HIV exposed uninfected infants while study 10PN-PD-DIT-064 assessed the safety and immunogenicity of Synflorix in children with increased risk for pneumococcal infections, i.e. children with sickle cell disease (SCD). Information including immunogenicity and safety results from both studies was added to the product information. The safety profile of Synflorix was considered acceptable in the studied high risk paediatric populations, suggesting that the benefit-risk profile of Synflorix is favourable in these populations. The benefit-risk profile of Synflorix is also considered favourable when administered in a 2+1 schedule beginning at 6 weeks of age. Administration of a booster dose (third or fourth dose) at 9 months of age does not adversely impact the safety profile and could provide additional benefit in terms of increased and prolonged protection. The CHMP considered the proposed changes to the SmPC to be acceptable with some modifications.   |

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with effectiveness data against pneumococcal vaccine serotypes and against vaccine related serotype 19A, and update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to include information on the immune response against serotype 19A observed in infants and children. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make minor editorial changes in the SmPC, and to request extensions to the due dates for MEA 009: Study 10PN-PD-DIT-034 (111634) and MEA 018.5: Study 10PN-PD-DIT-064 (114056).

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance | 23/07/2015 | 02/05/2016 | SmPC | In Brazil, Synflorix was introduced into the national immunization programme (NIP) using a 3+1 schedule in infants (2, 4, 6 months of age and a booster dose at 12 months) with a catch-up campaign in children up to 2 years of age. Based on almost 3 years of surveillance following Synflorix introduction, a matched case-control study reported a significant decrease in culture or PCR confirmed IPD due to any vaccine serotype, and IPD due to individual serotypes 6B, 14 and 19A. In Finland, Synflorix was introduced into NIP with a 2+1 schedule in infants (3, 5 months of age and a booster dose at 12 months) without catch-up campaign. Before and after NIP comparison suggests a significant decrease in the incidence of any culture confirmed IPD, any vaccine serotype IPD and IPD due to serotype 19A. It has also been demonstrated that Synflorix induces an immune response to the cross-reactive serotype 19A with |

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 23/04/2015 | 02/05/2016 | SmPC and PL | Prophylactic administration of antipyretics before or immediately after vaccine administration can reduce the incidence and intensity of post-vaccination febrile reactions. Clinical data generated with ibuprofen suggest that its delayed use might reduce fever, while prophylactic use of ibuprofen showed a limited effect.

The use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine does not replace the use of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines in children ≥ 2 years of age with conditions (such as sickle cell disease, asplenia, HIV infection, chronic illness, or those who are immunocompromised) placing them at higher risk for invasive disease due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Whenever recommended, children at risk who are ≥ 24 months of age and already primed with Synflorix should receive 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. |

Emerging safety concerns, such as Kawasaki disease need further follow-up. • Potential serotype replacement. Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Synflorix, which requires the submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional renewal application in 5 years time. |

In conclusion the IPD data from the COMPAS study support the previously presented data. The protective efficacy/effectiveness against AOM in the COMPAS and 053 studies was lower than expected. Updated analyses of the studies were provided. The results for the catch-up vaccination schedules did not change substantially, but as discussed by the MAH, are not considered robust, especially due to the short follow-up period. The study was not designed to compare different vaccination schedules, and the confidence intervals are generally wide for the AOM endpoints. Therefore the results should not be presented in detail; however a brief summary should be included in the SmPC. The CHMP considered that risk benefit balance of   |

| II/0051   | Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to update the safety information. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 30/05/2013   | 25/11/2013 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | This variation application provided safety and reactogenicity data for Synflorix up to the data lock point (DLP) of December 10, 2011. The safety database for Synflorix from clinical studies completed up to the DLP, consisted of 18 primary vaccination studies (including 7166 subjects in Total vaccinated cohort primed with Synflorix), 15 completed booster studies (5848 subjects in Booster Total vaccinated cohort receiving Synflorix) and five catch- up studies (883 subjects in Catch-up Total vaccinated cohort receiving Synflorix). In addition, post-marketing surveillance data in MAH worldwide safety database up to the DLP of April 2012 has been reviewed for spontaneous reports related to anaphylaxis and angioedema. Changes to the SmPC dealing with local and systemic events noted in primary, booster and catch up vaccination studies were proposed. The proposed additions/revisions to the SmPC were endorsed by the CHMP. The CHMP considered there was sufficient evidence of a causal relationship between Synflorix administration for anaphylaxis and angioedema to warrant an update of the relevant sections of the Product Information. Overall, the studies conducted with Synflorix and the post- marketing surveillance have demonstrated that the vaccine can be safely administered to infants and children up to 5 years of age together with other routinely administered |

| II/0044   | Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to add a warning related to psychogenic syncope. The package leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 20/09/2012   | 25/10/2012   | SmPC and PL        | The MAH provided a safety review to support an insertion of a warning statement regarding syncope associated with the injection of Synflorix. There has only been one possible report out of 63 million doses of Synflorix administered world-wide. The vast majority of doses were given to younger children, but some increase in the use in older children could be expected, as catch-up programs are introduced. It is therefore highly unlikely that insertion of a warning will prevent any further injuries among the infants, but possibly among the older children. In conclusion, the CHMP considered the inclusion of a warning in section 4.4 acceptable with the specification of the age range when these reactions could be expected. The update of contact details of local representatives was accepted.   |

| II/0016   | The MAH seeks to update section 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to include information on preterm infants based on the data provided in response to FUM 005 and FUM 006 that have been assessed by the Rapporteur and reviewed by the CHMP. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 16/12/2010   | 24/01/2011   | SmPC and PL | The current SmPC of 10Pn-PD-DiT in Europe has no recommendation with respect to the posology for vaccination of preterm infants and no description of the immunogenicity and safety of vaccination in preterm infants. The MAH has received requests from immunisation experts and healthcare professionals from several European Member States to have clarification of vaccination status for preterm infants and inclusion of the data in the SmPC for 10Pn-PD-DiT. The update of SmPC section 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to include information on preterm infants is based on data of two studies (primary and booster studies) that evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of 10Pn-PD- DiT when co-administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine in preterm infants (born after a gestation period of 27-36 weeks) as a 3-dose primary immunisation course during the first 6 months of life and then a booster dose at the age of 16-18 months (Studies 10PN-PD-DIT-015 and 10PN-PD- DIT-016). Having assessed these data the CHMP supports the inclusion of information on preterm infants in the SmPC |
