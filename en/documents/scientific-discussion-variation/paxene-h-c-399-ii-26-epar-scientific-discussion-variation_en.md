## Additional indication:

## Treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in patients who are not candidates for potentially curative surgery and/or radiation therapy.

As Taxol is also approved in the treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma  (NSCLC) in patients who are not candidates for potentially curative surgery and/or radiation therapy, clinical data related to this indication can be extrapolated to support the same indication for Paxene (see also 6.2, 6.3.1 and 7.1).

## Introduction

In advanced NSCLC (stage III or IV) with best supportive care alone, the median survival of patients is no greater than 3-6 months and 1-year survival less than 10%. In the early 1990's it was shown that cisplatin-based chemotherapy improved survival by a median of 2 months; symptoms in stage III/IV disease were relieved in up to three-quarters of patients, and QoL was better than with best supportive care alone (Belani &amp; Langer 2002). The introduction of further cytotoxic agents, e.g. taxanes (such as paclitaxel), gemcitabine, vinorelbine, carboplatin, during the 1990s presented new options for singleagent  and  combination therapy leading to the standard platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin)/paclitaxel treatment regimen (Belani &amp; Langer 2002, Crinò &amp; Calandri 2002).

In the second study CA139-165, 599 patients with stage IIIB or IV disease were randomised to receive cisplatin (75 mg/m 2 on day 1) and etoposide (100 mg/m 2 ) on days 1, 2 and 3 (n=200), or cisplatin (75 mg/m 2 ) and a low dose of paclitaxel (135 mg/m 2 over 24 h, n=198), or cisplatin (75 mg/m 2 ) and a high dose  of  paclitaxel  (250 mg/m 2 over  24  h)  with  G  CSF  (n=201)  every  3  weeks.  Although  median survival only approached significance in each individual paclitaxel-containing arm (p=0.097 and 0.090 for high dose paclitaxel/cisplatin/G-CSF and low-dose paclitaxel/cisplatin, respectively) compared to etoposide/cisplatin (due to better than anticipated survival in the etoposide/cisplatin arm), survival in the combined paclitaxel arms was significantly longer than with etoposide/cisplatin (9.7 months versus 7.4 months; 1-year survival 38% versus 32% [p=0.049]). Notably, survival in the subgroup with stage IIIB  disease  (19%  of  the  overall  trial  population)  was  substantially  greater  in  the  combined paclitaxel/cisplatin arms compared to etoposide/cisplatin (13.1 months versus 7.9 months [p=0.152]).

Efficacy of paclitaxel (Taxol)/cisplatin combination as first-line chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC was demonstrated in two Bristol-Myers Squibb randomised, controlled trials in more than 900 patients with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  (CA139-103,  Giaccone  et  al.  1998)  and  CA139-165, Bonomi et al. 2000). Clinical efficacy in the pivotal trials In  study  CA139-103, 332 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC were randomised to receive cisplatin (80 mg/m 2 ) on day 1 in combination with teniposide (100 mg/m 2 ) on days 1, 3, and 5 (n=166), or cisplatin (80 mg/m 2 ) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 over 3 h) on day 1 (n=166) every 3 weeks fora  maximum  of  6  cycles.  There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  increase  in  duration  of survival  with  cisplatin/paclitaxel  vs  cisplatin/tenoposide  (9.5  vs.  9.9  months  or  progression  free survival (5.1 vs. 5.0 months for cisplatin/teniposide. There was a significant benefit in terms of overall response  rate  (37%  cisplatin/paclitaxel  vs.  26%  cisplatin/teniposide.  Overall,  although  a  survival advantage could not be demonstrated with cisplatin/paclitaxel compared to cisplatin/teniposide in this trial,  the  higher  response  rates,  lesser  side  effects  and  improved  QoL  were  considered  important results in a palliative population.

With  respect  to  progression  free  survival  greater  benefits  were  noted  in  favour  of  the  paclitaxelcontaining arms and highly statistically significant results were noted for the high dose and combined paclitaxel  arms  compared  to  etoposide/cisplatin  (p ≤ 0.007  for  both  comparisons).  Finally  response rates also strongly favoured the paclitaxel-containing arms 13%, 30% and 26% for the etoposide/cisplatin,  high  dose  paclitaxel/cisplatin/G-CSF  (p&lt;0.001  versus  etoposide/cisplatin)  and low-dose paclitaxel/cisplatin regimens (p=0.003 versus etoposide/cisplatin), respectively. No differences in outcomes were noted for the high and low-dose paclitaxel treatment arms in comparison to one another.

In  conjunction  these  two  pivotal  phase  III  studies  are  the  primary  basis  for  the  existing  Taxol indication  for  the  treatment  of  advanced  NSCLC,  and  provide  the  principal  data  for  the  current application.  However,  prolongation  of  survival  with  paclitaxel/cisplatin  is  modest  and  further improvement in therapy is likely to require integration of novel, molecularly targeted agents such as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (e.g. gefitinib) in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy  (Belani  &amp;  Langer  2002,  Crinò  &amp;  Calandri  2002)  or  improvement  of  the  dosage schedules. Some of these questions have been addressed in the 12 clinical trials published since the pivotal BMS studies.

## Literature Review

Results  from  12 studies  (11 phase  III  studies  and  1 large  phase  II),  on  the  efficacy  and  safety  of paclitaxel-containing  combination  treatment,  mainly  paclitaxel/platinum  combinations,  in  patients with advanced NSCLC are summarised and discussed (Section 2.7.3 NSCLC). These studies provided additional evidence for the efficacy of paclitaxel/cisplatin in patients with advanced NSCLC.

Data  from more  than 6,000 eligible patients (4,300 patients treated with paclitaxel-containing regimens  and  1,700 patients  with  other  chemotherapeutic  regimens)  with  stage  III  or,  the  majority, stage IV NSCLC from these mainly open, randomised, multicenter studies are summarised in Table 8.1. All patients were between 18 and 87 years old. Prior surgery or radiotherapy was allowed but had to be completed approximately 2 4 weeks before study entry. Probably all patients were chemotherapy-naïve  (no  detailed  information  given  in  the  study  of  Gatzemeier  et  al.  2000).  The majority  of  the  patients  presented  with  a  performance  status  of  0-1  (ECOG  or  WHO  performance status), or Karnofsky index of 90-80%. The overall objectives of these trials were to compare survival, time to disease progression, response to treatment, and QoL  of paclitaxel-containing regimens vs. other chemotherapeutic regimens. Paclitaxel was combined with cisplatin, carboplatin, or gemcitabine, respectively; furthermore a triplet regimen of Paclitaxel cisplatin gemcitabine. Patients received 125 mg/m 2 (over 1 h), 175 - 225 mg/m 2 (over 3 h) or 135 mg/m 2 (over  24 h)  paclitaxel  in  combined  schedules.  The  mean  number  of  cycles ranged from 2 - 6, some patients received up to 10 cycles; in the majority of studies the regimens were administered in 3-week intervals (Table 8.1).

## Efficacy results

The clinical  response  (overall  response),  survival  (overall  survival,  1-  and  2-year  survival),  time  to disease progression/progression-free survival, and QoL of cisplatin- and carboplatin-based paclitaxelcontaining  regimens  are  compared  with  each  other  and  with  other  chemotherapeutic  regimens, respectively. Clinical Response Final  data  on  overall  response  rates  were  reported  in  11/12  studies.  Overall  response  rates  with paclitaxel/cisplatin  ranged  from  21-32%.  These  results  are  consistent  with  those  observed  in  the pivotal  BMS  studies  (overall  response  rates  25%-  41%  in  B-MS  CA139-103,  and  CA139-165, respectively).  No  further  significant  differences  with  regard  to  response  were  noticed  between paclitaxel/cisplatin  (various  dosage  regimens)  and  other  chemotherapeutic  regimens  tested,  i.e. paclitaxel/carboplatin  (Rosell  et  al.  2002,  Schiller  et  al.  2002),  paclitaxel/gemcitabine  (Smit  et  al. 2003), cisplatin/gemcitabine (Smit et al. 2003, Schiller et al. 2003) and cisplatin/docetaxel (Schiller et al. 2003). Overall  response  rates  during  paclitaxel/carboplatin  therapy  ranged  from  17-  32%.    There  was  no significant  difference  in  overall  response  between  paclitaxel/carboplatin  (various  dosage  regimens), paclitaxel/cisplatin  (Rosell  et  al.  2002,  Schiller  et  al.  2002,  see  above),  and  other  chemotherapeutic regimens, i.e.  paclitaxel/gemcitabine (Kosmidis et al. 2002),  cisplatin  plus  docetaxel  (Schiller  et  al. 2002), cisplatin plus gemcitabine (Scagliotti et al. 2002, Schiller et al. 2002), cisplatin plus vinorelbine (Kelly et al. 2001), and paclitaxel/carboplatin/gefitinib (Herbst et al. 2004).

In one study, overall response rates between different doses of paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 and 200 mg/m 2 over 3 hours, respectively) combined with fixed doses of carboplatin (AUC 6) were compared. The overall response rates were comparable: 26% in the paclitaxel (low-dose) and 23% (high-dose) arm (Glorieux et al. 2001). Different weekly application schemes of paclitaxel/carboplatin showed similar efficacy with regard to response parameters. However, in comparison with a 25% historical control rate,  a  lower  overall  response  with  paclitaxel/cisplatin  150  mg/m 2 in  cycle  1,  100  mg/m 2 in  cycle 2/AUC 2 weekly was observed (p=0.04) (Belani et al. 2003).

## Survival

Data on overall survival were available from 11of the/12 published studies. Overall survival was the primary endpoint in 7 of these and the secondary endpoint in the remaining studies. OS ranged from 7.8-  9.8  months  in  patients  who  were  treated  with  paclitaxel/cisplatin  (various  dosage  regimens) compared to 9.7 and 9.9 months, in studies CA139-103 and CA139-16, respectively.

The efficacy of paclitaxel/cisplatin was not significantly different from high-dose cisplatin (Gatzemeier  et  al.  2000),  paclitaxel/carboplatin  (Rosell  et  al.  2002,  Schiller  et  al.  2002)  or  other comparative chemotherapeutic treatments, i.e. paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (Smit et al. 2003), cisplatin

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

plus gemcitabine (Smit et al. 2003), or cisplatin plus docetaxel (Schiller et al. 2003). However, Rosell et  al.  (2002)  noticed  a  significant  difference  in  favour  of  paclitaxel/cisplatin  in  after  22  additional months follow-up: overall survival was 9.8 months in the paclitaxel/cisplatin arm vs.8.2 months in the paclitaxel/carboplatin  arm  (p=0.019).    Addition  of  gemcitabine  to  paclitaxel/cisplatin  resulted  in significantly prolonged survival vs. cisplatin/gemcitabine alone (approx. 11.9 months vs. 8.9 months, p&lt;0.05).  In  the  same  study  another  triple  combination  cisplatin/  gemcitabine/vinorelbine  was  also superior to cisplatin/gemcitabine (approx. 11.9 months p&lt;0.05) (Comella et al 2001).

During treatment with various dosage regimens of paclitaxel/carboplatin OS ranged from approximately 7.4 to10.4 months. In a comparison of different doses of paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 and 200 mg/m 2 , each over 3 hours) combined with fixed doses of carboplatin (AUC 6) OS was not statistically significantly higher with high-dose paclitaxel (8.5 months vs. 7.4 months in the low-dose paclitaxel arm) (Glorieux et al. 2001). In a study of weekly paclitaxel comparing different dosage regimens of paclitaxel/carboplatin, OS survival ranged from about 7.2 to 11.4 months. The differences were not significant (Belani et al. 2003).

Data  on  1-  and/or  2-year  survival  were  available  from  8 studies  (Table  3).  One-year  survival  rates ranged  from  30 -  38%  in  patients  treated  with  paclitaxel/cisplatin;  in  addition,  in  one  study  2-year survival  rates  were  reported  to  be  10%  with  paclitaxel/cisplatin  (Schiller  et  al.  2002).  These  data compare  to  1-year  survival  rates  of  39-43%  reported  in  the  pivotal  BMS  studies  (CA139-103  and CA139-165), and a 2-year rate of  19% in study CA139-103 (2-year data not available for CA139165). In patients receiving paclitaxel/carboplatin 1- and 2-year survival rates ranged from 33- 47%, and  11 - 19%, respectively. With weekly administration of paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin, the ranges for 1-year and 2-year survival rates of 31 - 47% and 10 - 19%, respectively, were similar (Belani et al. 2003, see Table 8.3).

## Time to Disease Progression (TTP) or Progression-Free Survival (PFS)

Data on TTP or PFS was available from 112 studies. TTP was the primary endpoint in 1 study and secondary endpoint in the remaining studies reporting on this parameter.

PFS in patients treated with paclitaxel/cisplatin in the pivotal BMS studies (CA139-103 and CA139165)  ranged  from  4.8-5.4  months.  Reported  TTP/PFS  ranged  from  3.4  to  4.2  months  with paclitaxel/cisplatin  (various  dosages)  in  subsequent  studies  (Gatzemeier  et  al.  2000,  Schiller  et  al. 2002).  There  was  a  significant  difference  in  favour  of  paclitaxel/cisplatin  reported  vs  high-dose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cisplatin (Gatzemeier et al. 2000), paclitaxel/gemcitabine (Smit et al. 2003), and paclitaxel/carboplatin (Rosell  et  al.  2002).  However,  cisplatin/gemcitabine  was  shown  to  be  significantly  superior  to paclitaxel/cisplatin  (Schiller  et  al.  2002).  The  addition  of  gemcitabine  to  paclitaxel/cisplatin  an increased  TTDP  was  reported  which  as  significantly  superior  to  cisplatin/gemcitabine  (approx.  4.4 months, p&lt;0.02) (Comella et al).

With paclitaxel/carboplatin TTP ranged from 3.1 to 7 months (Belani et al. 2003, Glorieux et al. 2001, Herbst et al. 2004 (paclitaxel/carboplatin/placebo), Kelly et al. 2001, Kosmidis et al. 2002, Scagliotti et  al.  2002,  Schiller  et  al.  2002).  As  above,  Rosell  et  al  reported  longer  TTP/PFS  for  paclitaxel/ cisplatin compared to paclitaxel/carboplatin (Rosell et al. 2002).  However, no differences were noted between  paclitaxel/carboplatin  in  various  dose  regimens  and  other  chemotherapy  regimens  i.e. paclitaxel/ gemcitabine (Kosmidis et al 2002, cisplatin/docetaxel (Schiller et al 2002), cisplatin/gemcitabine  (Scagliotti  et  al  2002,  Schiller  et  al  2002),  cisplatin/vinorelbine  (Kelly  et  al 2001), and paclitaxel/carboplatin/gefitinib (Herbst et al 2004).

With weekly administration of paclitaxel, TTP ranged from approximately 4.9 to 7 months in patients receiving paclitaxel/carboplatin (Belani et al. 2003). The regimen of paclitaxel 100 mg/m 2 weekly plus carboplatin AUC 6 mg/ml/min (PTX LD/CAR HD, 4-week intervals) was superior to paclitaxel 100 mg/m 2 plus carboplatin AUC 2 mg/ml/min weekly (PTX LD/CAR LD, 4-week intervals).

In summary differences for TTP/PFS were noted between a number of regimens. With regard to the standard regimen of paclitaxel/cisplatin differences in TTP/PFS where observed favoured paclitaxel/cisplatin, except in comparison to cisplatin/gemcitabine . However, it should be noted that differences in TTP/PFS were not reflected in overall survival (see Table 8. 4).

## Quality of Life

In 5 of the analysed studies, the impact of paclitaxel/platinum-containing regimens on quality of life was evaluated. There were no significant differences for overall QoL.

## Gatzemeier et al. 2000

A  combination  of  paclitaxel  plus  low  dose  cisplatin  was  compared  with  high-dose  cisplatin monotherapy in 414 patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC.  There was no significant improvement in survival  in  the  paclitaxel/cisplatin  arm  vs.  the  high-dose  cisplatin  arm;  however,  the  combination produced a better clinical response, resulting in an increased time to progression.

## Smit et al. 2003

Paclitaxel/cisplatin (control arm) was compared with paclitaxel/gemcitabine and cisplatin/gemcitabine in  480 patients  with  NSCLC.  Cisplatin/gemcitabine  and  paclitaxel/gemcitabine  did  not  increase overall  survival vs. paclitaxel/cisplatin  and  there  was  shorter  progression-free  survival  in  the paclitaxel/gemcitabine group versus the paclitaxel/cisplatin group.

## Comella et al. 2001

A cisplatin-containing triplet regimen of paclitaxel/cisplatin/gemcitabine (n=114 patients) was compared  with  cisplatin/gemcitabine  (n=122)  and  a  triplet  of  cisplatin/gemcitabine/vinorelbine (n=117) in 354 patients with NSCLC. The triplet regimens paclitaxel/cisplatin plus gemcitabine and cisplatin/gemcitabine/vinorelbine were associated with improved outcome

## Rosell et al. 2002

A paclitaxel/carboplatin combination was compared with a paclitaxel/cisplatin combination in a total of 618 patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC. Paclitaxel/carboplatin yielded a similar response rate to paclitaxel/cisplatin; however, median survival was significantly longer with paclitaxel/cisplatin.

## Discussion of Efficacy

In  the  pivotal  BMS  trials  paclitaxel/cisplatin  produced  improvements  in  response  (compared  to teniposide/cisplatin  and  etoposide/cisplatin),  survival  and  progression-free  survival  (compared  to etoposide/cisplatin) in patients with advanced NSCLC. These data led to paclitaxel/cisplatin becoming the  new  reference  regimen.  Although  survival  benefits  with  paclitaxel/cisplatin  in  advanced  are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

modest,  no  other  chemotherapeutic  regimens  have  to  date  shown  consistent  survival  or  QOL advantages over paclitaxel/cisplatin.

Paclitaxel-containing  chemotherapy  regimens,  mainly  paclitaxel/cisplatin  and  paclitaxel/carboplatin, produced a favourable treatment response,  an improvement in survival, time to  disease  progression and progression-free survival in patients with advanced NSCLC.

Paclitaxel/cisplatin  was  significantly  superior  to  cisplatin  monotherapy  in  terms  of  overall  response and time to disease progression (Gatzemeier et al. 2000). In comparison with paclitaxel/carboplatin, paclitaxel/cisplatin showed comparable efficacy with regard to response, time to disease progression, and survival (overall survival, 1 and/or 2 year survival). In terms of progression-free survival/time to progression, paclitaxel/cisplatin was found to be superior to paclitaxel/carboplatin (Rosell et al. 2002), high-dose cisplatin (Gatzemeier et al. 2000) and paclitaxel/gemcitabine (Smit et al. 2003). However, TTP for paclitaxel/cisplatin was shorter than cisplatin/gemcitabine (Schiller et al 2002), although no difference in survival was noted.

Data from the pivotal BMS Taxol studies (CA139-103, and CA139-165) are supported by data from 4 subsequent studies. In each, paclitaxel/cisplatin combinations were administered and results consistent with  those  of  the  pivotal  studies  in  terms  of  survival,  progression  free  survival  and  response  were observed.  Only  one  study  reported  long-term  results  (Rosell  et  al.  2002).  A  survival  update  after 22 months additional follow-up yielded a median survival of 8.2 months (paclitaxel/carboplatin) and 9.8 months  (paclitaxel/cisplatin)  (p=0.019).    These  supplementary  data  therefore  support  the  use  of paclitaxel/cisplatin in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. In  conclusion,  paclitaxel/cisplatin  is  established  as  first-line  therapy  of  patients  with  advanced NSCLC. The recommended dose of paclitaxel is 175 mg/m² administered over a period of 3 hours, followed  by  cisplatin  80  mg/m²,  with  a  3-week  interval  between  courses.  Paclitaxel/carboplatin  is generally  considered  an  alternative  regimen  with  comparable  activity.  The  place  of  alternative regimens  (e.g.  cisplatin/gemcitabine,  paclitaxel/cisplatin/gemcitabine)  in  the  therapy  of  advanced NSCLC is to be confirmed. Clinical safety Paclitaxel  has  been  in  clinical  use  for  more  than  10 years  for  treatment  of  patients  with  ovarian carcinoma,  breast  carcinoma,  NSCLC,  and  AIDS-related  Kaposi's  sarcoma.  Its  safety  profile  has remained consistent  and  is  well  known,  being  summarised  in  various  standard  manuals  and  review articles  (Eisenhauer  &amp;  Vermorken  1998,  Dollery  1999,  Fan  1999,  Ginsberg  et  al.  1997,  Sweetman 2002,  Spencer  &amp;  Faulds  1994,  Sweetman  2002,  Wiseman  &amp;  Spencer  1998).  The  most  common adverse  events  are  neutropenia,  anaemia,  peripheral  neuropathy,  myalgia/arthralgia,  mucositis,  and alopecia (Wiseman &amp; Spencer 1998). In addition, thrombocytopenia, infection, cardiovascular events, hepatic  abnormalities  (increases  in  bilirubin,  alkaline  phosphatase,  aspartate  aminotransferase)  mild gastrointestinal effects, and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported (Eisenhauer &amp; Vermorken 1998, Spencer &amp; Faulds 1994).

## Taxol Data

The following safety data were derived from the publications of the four pivotal BMS studies.

Ovarian cancer

The severity of neutropenia, febrile neuropenia, alopecia, and peripheral neurotoxicity was significantly greater (p ≤ 0.05), in the paclitaxel/cisplatin group. Although neutropenia of grade 3 and 4 developed  in  the  majority  of  women  in  the  paclitaxel/cisplatin  group,  the  incidence  of  febrile neutropenia  was  low  and  was  consistent  with  the  brevity  of  paclitaxel-induced  myelosuppression. Peripheral neurotoxicity was more common in the paclitaxel group but overall was very mild.

As expected, substantially more patients in the paclitaxel/cisplatin group experienced severe myalgia, neurosensory and neuromotor symptoms, alopecia, and hypersensitivity reactions.

## NSCLC

Haematologic toxicity (leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia) was significantly more frequent  and  more  severe  on  cisplatin/teniposide  than  on  paclitaxel/cisplatin.  The  more  profound myelosuppression of cisplatin/teniposide led more frequently to febrile neutropenia and significantly more infectious  episodes.  More  patients  received  blood  transfusions  on  cisplatin/teniposide  than  on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

paclitaxel/cisplatin.  Cisplatin/teniposide  also  induced  more  stomatitis.  On  the  other  hand,  more peripheral neurotoxicity, myalgia/arthralgia, and hypersensitivity reactions were observed on paclitaxel/cisplatin  than  on  cisplatin/teniposide.  Peripheral  neurotoxicity  on  paclitaxel/cisplatin  was more severe in patients who continued treatment with paclitaxel beyond six cycles.  Two hypersensitivity reactions  were  observed  on cisplatin/teniposide and 10 on paclitaxel/cisplatin. However, in only 3 cases on the paclitaxel/cisplatin arm were these severe requiring discontinuation of treatment.

Overall,  treatment  was  discontinued  because  of  toxicity  in  3 patients  on  cisplatin/teniposide,  and  in 5 patients on paclitaxel/cisplatin. Cardiotoxicity and other non-haematologic side effects were similar in  the  two  arms.  Apart  from  alopecia,  which  was  present  in  the  majority  of  patients,  and  vomiting, which was severe in 12% of patients, overall, the other adverse events were infrequent.

There were 9 toxic deaths: 6 on cisplatin/teniposide (3.7%) and 3 on paclitaxel/cisplatin (1.9%). Six of these deaths were due to sepsis due to severe neutropenia, 5 of which occurred in the cisplatin/teniposide arm and 1 in paclitaxel/cisplatin arm. One patient on paclitaxel/cisplatin died of haemorrhage  while  severely  thrombocytopenic  after  the  third  cycle,  and  another  died  of  renal insufficiency.  One  patient  on  cisplatin/teniposide  died  of  heart  failure.  In  four  additional  patients, toxicity could not be definitely excluded as the cause of early death (3 patients in the cisplatin/teniposide arm: 2 possibly due to severe infection, 1 had a sudden cardiac death; 1 patient in the paclitaxel/cisplatin arm: sudden cardiac death) (Giaccone et al. 1998).

Significant  differences  in  haematological  and  non-haematological  toxicity)  between  the  treatment regimens are presented in detail.  Although direct comparisons between the various regimens tested are not possible since the dosages used in the different studies as well as the patient populations are heterogeneous, a comprehensive overview on the pattern of adverse events observed with paclitaxelcontaining treatment regimens can be provided.

Literature Review To provide an update to the safety data presented in the Taxol documentation, supportive safety data on  paclitaxel-containing  combinations  from  20 additional  studies  published  since  2000  (advanced ovarian cancer) and since 1997 (NSCLC), have been reviewed. These publications are identical with those analysed for efficacy, with the exception of Piccart et al. (2003), who did not report any safety data. Overall,  more  than  12,000  patients  with  either  advanced  ovarian  cancer  (n=6,299)  or  advanced NSCLC  (6,093),  were  eligible  for  safety  analysis  in  the  supportive  clinical  trials  (see  also  Table 2.7.4-1).  Of  these,  approximately  9,000  subjects  were  treated  with  paclitaxel-containing  regimens (4,735 with ovarian cancer, 4,315 with NSCLC)  and  about 3,000 patients received other chemotherapeutic regimens (1,564 with ovarian cancer, 1,778 with NSCLC). Adverse event profile of paclitaxel-containing combinations Haematological and non-haematological adverse events reported in the analysed 20 clinical studies are summarised. Myelotoxicity, predominantly neutropenia or leukopenia, was most common and doselimiting. Peripheral neuropathy occurred relatively frequently in patients treated with higher doses of paclitaxel and tended to be the main non-haematologic dose-limiting toxicity. Other adverse effects include  myalgias  and  arthralgias,  alopecia,  diarrhoea  and  mucositis,  which  all  appear  to  be  doserelated,  as  well  as  some  cardiac  abnormalities  (mainly  asymptomatic  bradycardia).  Severe  acute hypersensitivity reactions also occurred in some patients. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Haematological toxicity: Haematological adverse events were reported in both paclitaxel-containing and  non-paclitaxel-containing  regimens.  In  the  majority  of  publications,  severe  (grade 3  and  4) toxicities  were  listed.    The  following  haematologic  toxicities  occurred:  neutropenia,  leukopenia, thrombocytopenia,  anaemia,  febrile  neutropenia/fever,  (neutropenic)  infections).  Several  patients required platelet or red blood cell transfusions due to thrombocytopenia or anaemia .

Neutropenia  occurred  significantly  more  frequently  in  patients  receiving  paclitaxel/cisplatin  or paclitaxel monotherapy vs. patients were treated with single agent cisplatin (Muggia et al. 2000, and Gatzemeier et al. 2000, respectively) and tended to be more severe with paclitaxel monotherapy.

In  two  studies,  neutropenia  was  more  frequently  noticed  with  paclitaxel/carboplatin  than  with paclitaxel/cisplatin (Du Bois et al. 2003b; Neijt et al. 2000); however, in other studies no significant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

differences were found between both regimens (Ozols et al. 2003, Rosell et al. 2002, Schiller et al. 2002). Neutropenia was also reported to be significantly more frequent with cisplatin/vinorelbine vs. paclitaxel/carboplatin (Kelly et al 2001, Scagliotti et al 2002) or cisplatin/gemcitabine (Scagliotti et al 2002).

Anaemia: Anaemia  was  reported  significantly  more  frequently,  and  with  greater  severity,  among patients who were treated with paclitaxel/cisplatin or cisplatin monotherapy (Muggia et al. 2000) than paclitaxel monotherapy. It occurred more frequently with cisplatin/gemcitabine vs. paclitaxel/cisplatin (Schiller et al 2002, Smit et al 2003). Anemia occurred more frequently with cisplatin/vinorelbine vs. paclitaxel/carboplatin  (Scagliotti  et  al  2002)  however,  Kelly  et  al  (2001)  noticed  no  significant difference with the same doses.

Febrile neutropenia and (neutropenic) infections: Febrile neutropenia was significantly more frequent with paclitaxel/cisplatin compared to paclitaxel/carboplatin or to cisplatin/gemcitabine in the study of Schiller  et  al.  (2002);  however,  in  another  study  no  significant  differences  were  found  between paclitaxel/cisplatin and paclitaxel/carboplatin (Rosell et al. 2002).

Febrile neutropenia was seen more often in patients on paclitaxel/carboplatin/epirubicin vs paclitaxel/carboplatin; and was fatal in two patients on the triple arm (Kristensen et al. 2001). Fever occurred more frequently in patients on paclitaxel/cisplatin and high-dose paclitaxel single agent vs single agent cisplatin, and tended to be more severe with the high-dose paclitaxel regimen (Muggia et al. 2000). Platelet  and  red  blood  cell  transfusions: In  the  study  of  Smit  et  al.  (2003)  patients  treated  with cisplatin/gemcitabine needed transfusions significantly more often (95% red blood cell) than patients who  received  paclitaxel/cisplatin. In another study, packed  red blood cell transfusions  were significantly less on the paclitaxel/carboplatin arm vs cisplatin/gemcitabine and cisplatin/vinorelbine arms  (Scagliotti  et  al.  2002).  Du  Bois  et  al.  (2003b)  described  a  higher  frequency  of  red  cell transfusions in patients receiving paclitaxel/carboplatin vs paclitaxel/cisplatin. Non-haematological toxicity Significant differences between the various treatment regimens are summarised below. Neurotoxicity: Any grade of peripheral neuropathy was significantly more frequent with paclitaxel/cisplatin vs single agent cisplatin (Gatzemeier et al. 2000). Peripheral sensory neuropathy (all grades) occurred more frequently with paclitaxel/cisplatin vs paclitaxel/carboplatin (Du Bois et al. 2003b). However, several authors observed no significant differences in the frequency of neuropathy in paclitaxel/cisplatin and paclitaxel/carboplatin treated patients (Neijt et al. 2000, Rosell et al. 2002, Schiller et al 2000); however, Neijt et al did note that grade 1 neurotoxicity occurred earlier in patients who  were  treated  with  paclitaxel/cisplatin  Neijt  et  al.  2000).  Significant  differences  were  found comparing  two  different  doses  of  paclitaxel  (175 mg/m 2 and  225 mg/m 2 over  3 h,  respectively)  in combination  with  carboplatin  (AUC 6):  neurotoxic  events  were  more  frequent  with  high-dose paclitaxel  group  (Bolis  et  al.  2004).  Peripheral  neuropathy  (grade  3 and  4)  was  increased  in  the cisplatin/vinorelbine  arm  vs  paclitaxel/carboplatin  (Kelly  et  al.  2001).  Mild  neuropathy  (grade  1-2) was significantly more common  with  the triplet regimens paclitaxel/cisplatin/gemcitabin and cisplatin/gemcitabine/vinorelbine vs cisplatin/gemcitabine (Comella et al. 2001). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Arthralgia/myalgia: Symptoms  of arthralgia/myalgia were significantly more frequent with paclitaxel/cisplatin vs cisplatin monotherapy (Gatzemeier et al. 2000).

Gastrointestinal  toxicity: Paclitaxel/carboplatin  showed  better  tolerability  than  paclitaxel/cisplatin (Ozols et al. 2003). Nausea and vomiting were more often observed with paclitaxel/cisplatin than with paclitaxel/carboplatin  (Du  Bois  et  al.  2003b,  Rosell  et  al.  2002,  Schiller  et  al.  2000).  Nausea  and vomiting (grade 3 and 4) were increased with cisplatin/vinorelbine (Kelly et al. 2001, Scagliotti et al. 2002) and with paclitaxel/carboplatin/epirubicin (Kristensen et al. 2001) compared to paclitaxel/carboplatin. Furthermore, the frequency was higher with cisplatin/vinorelbine in comparison with cisplatin/gemcitabine (Scagliotti et al. 2002). However, with cisplatin/gemcitabine the frequency of grade 3 vomiting was approximately doubled in comparison to the triplet regimens

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

paclitaxel/cisplatin/gemcitabine and cisplatin/gemcitabine/vinorelbine  In the triplet combinations the cisplatin dose was split between days 1 and 8 while in the doublet regimen the whole cisplatin dose was  given  on  day  1  (Comella  et  al.  2001)  which  may  have  accounted  for  the  difference  in gastrointestinal tolerability.  However, Smit et al. (2003) noticed no significant differences between cisplatin/gemcitabine, paclitaxel/cisplatin, or paclitaxel/gemcitabine for grade 3 and 4 nausea/ vomiting. In  one  study  diarrhoea  was  more  often  noticed  with  paclitaxel/cisplatin  than  with paclitaxel/carboplatin (Rosell et al. 2002) but this was not the case in other studies.

Alopecia: Generally, with paclitaxel-containing regimens grade 1 and 2 alopecia was more frequently described  than  grade  3 to  4  alopecia.  With  paclitaxel  monotherapy  or  paclitaxel/cisplatin,  alopecia (grade 1 and 2) occurred significantly more frequently, and with greater severity, than in patients with single  agent  cisplatin  (Muggia  et  al.  2000).  Neijt  et  al.  (2000)  found  no  differences  in  alopecia, between paclitaxel/cisplatin and paclitaxel/carboplatin .

Nephrotoxicity :  Renal toxicity was mainly grade 1 to 2. Grade 3 to 4 occurred at a significantly higher frequency with single agent cisplatin (100 mg/m 2 ) vs. paclitaxel/cisplatin (Muggia et al. 2000). Renal toxicity  (all  grades)  was  less  frequent  with  paclitaxel/carboplatin  vs.  paclitaxel/cisplatin,  rarely exceeding grade 1 or 2 (Du Bois et al. 2003b, Rosell et al. 2002). However, Neijt et al. (2000) found no differences in renal adverse events between paclitaxel/cisplatin and paclitaxel/carboplatin. Grade 3 to 5 renal toxicity was rare, being more frequent with cisplatin/gemcitabine vs. to paclitaxel/cisplatin (Schiller et al. 2000).

Mucositis: Mucositis  was  significantly  more  common  with  triple  chemotherapy  consisting  of paclitaxel/carboplatin/epirubicin than  paclitaxel/carboplatin (Kristensen et al. 2001). Ototoxicity: Ototoxicity  occurred  mainly  in  platinum-containing  combinations.  Significantly  more patients  developed  ototoxicity  (any  grade)  with  cisplatin  monotherapy  than  with  paclitaxel/cisplatin group  (Gatzemeier  et  al.  2000).  Ototoxicity  was  less  frequent  with  paclitaxel/carboplatin    vs paclitaxel/cisplatin and rarely exceeded grade 1 or 2 (Du Bois et al. 2003b). Discontinuation from study and deaths Discontinuation of therapy due to haematological or non-haematological adverse events, was reported for most studies. There  were  82  deaths  due  to  therapy  reported  in  the  analysed  studies.  Cause  of  death  included: haematological  toxicity  (grade  4  not  further  specified)  with  carboplatin  followed  by  paclitaxel/ cisplatin and paclitaxel/cisplatin,), severe myelosuppression (paclitaxel/carboplatin), febrile neutropenia (paclitaxel/carboplatin/epirubicin), and non-haematological toxicity (grade 4 gastrointestinal toxicity (not further specified) with paclitaxel/cisplatin,, intestinal obstruction (paclitaxel/carboplatin/gefitinib HD), dehydration plus kidney failure (paclitaxel/carboplatin/gefitinib HD), pulmonary embolus (paclitaxel/carboplatin/gefitinib LD), cerebrovascular accident (paclitaxel/carboplatin/gefitinib HD), sepsis (paclitaxel/carboplatin/gefitinib LD, paclitaxel/ carboplatin), acute respiratory distress syndrome (paclitaxel/carboplatin), sudden death (paclitaxel/carboplatin/gefitinib HD), and rapidly progressive disease (paclitaxel/carboplatin).

## Discussion of safety

In  summary,  myelosuppression  (particularly  neutropenia,  leukopenia)  was  the  most  frequently reported haematological adverse event and occurred with all paclitaxel-containing regimens. Neuropathy (both sensory and motor), arthralgia/myalgia, asthenia, and alopecia (mainly grade 1 to 2) were  the  most  frequently  observed  non-haematological  adverse  events  with  paclitaxel-containing regimens.  Neurological  toxicity  occurred  significantly  more  often  with  high-dose  single  agent cisplatin  compared  to  high-dose  single  agent  paclitaxel.  Inconsistent  results  were  obtained  with paclitaxel/cisplatin  versus  cisplatin  monotherapy:  in  one  study  paclitaxel/cisplatin  was  superior  to cisplatin  with  regard  to  neurotoxicity  while  in  another  investigation  cisplatin  was  superior  to  the doublet regimen. Furthermore, in several studies  paclitaxel/carboplatin  was  associated  with  a  lower incidence  of  neuropathy  in  comparison  with  paclitaxel/cisplatin  but  various  authors  observed  no significant  differences  between  both  treatments.  Nausea/vomiting  and  diarrhoea  were  the  most

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

frequently reported gastrointestinal adverse events with paclitaxel-containing regimens. Significantly more  patients  experienced  nausea  and  vomiting  with  cisplatin  monotherapy  compared  to  the paclitaxel/cisplatin.  Paclitaxel/carboplatin  showed  a  better  tolerability  than  paclitaxel/cisplatin  for non-haematological toxicities. The pattern of adverse events observed in the recent paclitaxel literature are  consistent  with  those  previously  described  during  the  BMS  paclitaxel  development  programme. Discontinuation  from  study  and  deaths  were  as  expected  for  patients  with  cancer.  No  unexpected toxicities or new safety issues were identified during these clinical trials.

## Post-marketing experience

In the United States, paclitaxel is approved as Onxol (paclitaxel) Injection by IVAX; the product is identical to Paxene (paclitaxel) Injection, distributed by IVAX in Europe (IVAX Research Inc. 2003). For Onxol in total 12 Quarterly Adverse Drug Experience Reports are available, covering the period from  15/9/00  to  14/903.  During  this  3-year  period  the  MAH  received  a  total  of  80  adverse  events reports from approximately 30,000 to 40,000 patients exposed to Onxol  .

The  marketing  of  Paxene  started  in  May  2004.  All  previous  PSURs  submitted  to  the  EMEA  were based on published data and Onxol  only.

In the renewal of the marketing authorisation application for Paxene submitted in April 2004, the 7 th PSUR (which covered the period from July 1999 to January 2004 and also included the USA data from January 2000 to December 2003) summarised a total of 113 cases of adverse events  from a total estimated  patient  exposure  of  approximately  77,000  patients.  Fourteen  were  spontaneous  reports received by Ivax Pharmaceuticals from healthcare professionals and the remaining 99 cases identified from the literature. Fifty-three cases were considered to be serious and 8 had a fatal outcome. Twentytwo serious unlabelled adverse events were reported. The  majority  of  the  reported  adverse  events  were  labelled  such  as  hypersensitivity  reactions, haematological  toxicity,  nervous  system  disorders  (i.e.  neuropathy  and  encephalopathy),  and  nail changes. There were 33 reported adverse events, which are not listed in the currently approved SPC, which  were  addressed  during  the  assessment  of  renewal.  Subsequently,  the SPC  has  been  update accordingly.
