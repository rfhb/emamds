|           | Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC, subsection 'cardiovascular risk', with results from a new meta- analysis evaluating the cardiovascular safety of vildagliptin. In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to bring the annexes in line with the latest QRD template version 10, and to merge the two SmPCs into one single SmPC for Eucreas, Icandra and Zomarist. Moreover, the section on pregnancy and breast-feeding in the PL for Eucreas/Icandra/Zomarist has been aligned with the wording used for Galvus/Jalra/Xiliarx. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   |            |            |      | for vildagliptin and 49 weeks for comparators) was performed and showed that vildagliptin treatment was not associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk versus comparators. The composite endpoint of adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including acute myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death was similar for vildagliptin versus combined active and placebo comparators [Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio (M-H RR) 0.82 (95% CI 0.61 1.11)]. A MACE occurred in 83 out of 9,599 (0.86%) vildagliptin-treated patients and in 85 out of 7,102 (1.20%) comparator-treated patients. Assessment of each individual MACE component showed no increased risk (similar M-H RR). Confirmed heart failure (HF) events defined as HF requiring hospitalisation or new onset of HF were reported in 41 (0.43%) vildagliptin-treated patients and 32 (0.45%) comparator-treated patients with M-H RR   |

Update of sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to include data in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and congestive heart failure NYHA class I- III. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest version of the QRD template. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- | 27/06/2013 | 26/07/2013 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | With the current variation new clinical data in patients with T2DM and CHF NYHA class I-III has been provided. Based on previously available data, the use of vildagliptin in patients with CHF in NYHA class I-II has been accepted, whereas the use of vildagliptin in patients with CHF in NYHA class III-IV has not been recommended due to lack of data. The number of patients in NYHA class III treated with vildagliptin is still limited (47) and the data indicate that there were imbalances with regards to background morbidity, thus the data has to be interpreted with caution and the data are insufficient to make claims on the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin in this patient group. In the study submitted, the primary objective was to investigate the effect of vildagliptin on cardiac safety with change in LVEF being the primary outcome. The data on LVEF, as well as on worsening of CHF does not indicate any adverse effect of vildagliptin on cardiac function and there |

There were, however, imbalances in AE reporting with more SAEs and deaths observed in the vildagliptin treated NYHA class III population. This was most likely related to the background morbidity. The safety data from the study is in line with the known safety profile of vildagliptin. However, data in patients with CHF NYHA III is still limited and this issue will be continuously monitored in future PSURs which is endorsed. The outcome with regards to HbA1c, responder analysis and FPG in the overall study population (CHF, NYHA class I- III) was in line with that observed in previous studies with vildagliptin although the effect was less prominent at week 52. In patient with CHF, NYHA class III, the HbA1c was modest (-0.3 %), however, this subgroup of patients was small and there are indications of heterogeneity in the data which may explain the modest reduction in HbA1c. This was reflected in the study description in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Due to the limited number of patients, the data provided is still deemed insufficient to decide on the overall benefit risk balance of vildagliptin in patients with CHF NYHA class III. The submitted study, which focused on changes in LVEF in patients treated with vildagliptin, however, provides sufficient data to allow a cautious use in these patients support that vildagliptin has no negative effect on cardiac function and there is no mechanistic/biological rationale for such an effect.

In the assessment of the PSUR No 7 of Galvus, 19 post marketing reports of blistering dermatitis, bullous rash pemphigus were identified. Of these, a causal association to vildagliptin was suspected in 9 cases. To further evaluate the possible risk of skin adverse reactions associated with vildagliptin, the MAH was requested to submit a thorough evaluation of all relevant cases. This evaluation concluded that 'bullous or exfoliative lesions' should be added to the description of the post-marketing experience of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. |

Data from clinical trials, although not statistically significant, indicate a slightly increased risk of persistent transaminase elevation in patients treated with vildagliptin relative to the comparators. This risk is reflected in the current labeling. Following a request by the CHMP (EMA/549257/2010), the MAH has conducted an evaluation |

Based on this, the CHMP considered that the safety information referring to the post-marketing experience in section 4.8 should be updated to reflect this safety concern.

| WS/0164 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of Section 4.4 of the SPC and relevant section of the PL to include a warning on pancreatitis, following assessment of the latest PSUR. C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH | 22/09/2011 | 27/10/2011 | SmPC and PL | Following the review of the latest vildagliptin PSUR, the CHMP requested the addition to the SmPC of a warning statement on acute pancreatitis including information that patients should be informed on the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis, that resolution has been observed after discontinuation and that treatment should not be resumed after pancreatitis has been diagnosed. Few cases of pancreatitis were reported in the clinical trials safety data base and there was no apparent imbalance between vildagliptin and comparators/placebo. In five of the cases the pancreatitis occurred in the context of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis and all the four cases in which vildagliptin was re-initiated belonged to this group. That is, all the rechallenged cases had an easily identifiable risk factor for pancreatitis present and all four rechallenges were negative. |

The cut-off date for the latest PSUR was 30 Nov 2010, thus the current report covers an additional time period of five months. Overall, the analysis of post-marketing events consistent with pancreatitis in vildagliptin agents revealed 42 cases of pancreatitis/acute pancreatitis and 15 cases of reported elevated lipase/amylase. The majority of reported cases had additional risk factors for pancreatitis. A warning statement on acute pancreatitis and that patients should be informed on the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis has been introduced in the product information, in line with the current warnings given for other DPP4-inhibitors. The data provided with this variation is not considered to alter the benefit risk balance for vildagliptin, which remains   |

| WS/0070   | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 4.2 of the SPC following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, to reflect the safety and efficacy data that the MAH has accumulated in patients > 75 years. The MAH also takes this opportunity to implement the latest QRD template, to update Annex IIB with the new RMP version and to update some local representatives' details in the PL. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 16/12/2010 | 24/01/2011 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | During the review of the original marketing authorization application for vildagliptin, there was only a limited number of patients > 75 years who had been treated with vildagliptin (N=113) in clinical studies. Since then, the number of elderly patients ? 75 years treated with vildagliptin has increased. In the enlarged database, 334 patients > 75 years were exposed to vildagliptin, 295 of which are included in the main safety population and up to 187 in the efficacy populations. The majority of the patients were treated with the approved dose 50 mg bid. The submitted analyses support a similar efficacy in elderly patients compared to the younger population with respect to reduction of HbA1c and FPG. The treatment was largely weight neutral and the incidence of hypoglycaemia was low. No other safety issues compared to comparators or the younger population were identified. There are limited safety data on the use of vildagliptin in patients with moderately and severely impaired renal function at risk for higher drug exposure. Until data from ongoing studies in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment become available, the use of vildagliptin is not recommended in this population. This would also apply for the elderly patient population > 75 years. |

| of long-term treatment (52 weeks) with vildagliptin to gliclazide in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy. The presented results from this study are in line with what has been seen in previous studies with vildagliptin in combination with sulfonylurea. The second study was a 24-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled initial combination therapy study with the fixed dose combination of vildagliptin plus metformin in drug naïve patients with T2DM. The results of this study demonstrated that initial combination therapy with the fixed dose combination of vildagliptin plus metformin was statistically superior to that of both individual monotherapy components. Initial combination therapy is not recommended as first line treatment in treatment guidelines and is not in line with the approved indication for vildagliptin. However, the CHMP accepted that information on this study was added to section 5.1 of the SPC. A new pooled safety analysis has been performed which integrates data from these new studies and provides an updated assessment of the safety and tolerability of vildagliptin based on data from more than 11,500 patients. The increased database was also utilized to conduct an extensive analysis of the cardiovascular safety of vildagliptin. The CHMP agreed that this information is consistent with the previously submitted pooled safety data and does not signal any new, unidentified concerns.

| II/0004   | Update of SPC sections 4.8 and 5.1 and PL to include information on the results of 3 active-controlled long- term clinical studies. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 23/07/2009   | 28/08/2009 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | During the review of the initial Marketing Authorisation application for vildagliptin, the Marketing Authorisation Holder committed to submit the results of ongoing, active- controlled, long-term, comparative studies. This included one 2-year monotherapy study, one ? 2-year add-on combination therapy study with metformin, and one 1-year (24 week + 28 week extension) add-on combination therapy study with metformin. The results of these studies have now become available and are discussed in the current variation application. Furthermore, a review of the safety of vildagliptin has been performed, integrating data from the above studies of up to more than 2 years in duration as well as from additional studies. Concerning efficacy, non-inferiority to the comparators (glimepiride and pioglitazone), according to the pre- specified non-inferiority margins, was achieved in the add- on to metformin studies, but not in the monotherapy study. In all studies the absolute reduction of HbA1c with vildagliptin was lower compared to the comparators. Concerning safety, vildagliptin has a hypoglycemia profile superior to that of glimepiride and similar to that of pioglitazone and metformin. Previously, signals concerning hepatic and skin safety have been identified. In the current |
