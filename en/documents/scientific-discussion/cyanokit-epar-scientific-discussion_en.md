## 1. Introduction

## Problem statement

## · Cyanide Poisoning, toxicity

The  most  toxic  cyanide  forms  are  hydrogen  cyanide  (HCN,  hydrocyanic  acid)  and  its  sodium  and potassium salts, as well as cyanogen or dicyanogen and its halides. Cyanogens are more of an irritant than cyanides.

The possible use of cyanide as an agent of terror is addressed in the EMEA/CPMP guidance document (EMEA/CPMP/1255/03) on the use of medicinal products  for  the  treatment  of  patients  exposed  to terrorist attacks with chemical agents.

Cyanide poisoning can occur following inhalation, ingestion, or contact of cyanide with the skin or mucus membranes. The main exposure route is by inhalation of volatile cyanides, particularly threw fire  smoke for which hydrogen cyanide significantly contributes to toxicity. Cyanide poisoning can also  occur  following  industrial  accidents.  Regarding  the  two  other  routes,  absorption  through  intact skin or mucous membranes following dermal or oral exposure is good and systemic toxicity can be expected.

Cyanide and cyanogens are cellular poisons binding to enzymes, mainly metallo-enzymes, with high affinity for Fe 3+ and consequent cytochrome oxidase inhibition, thus blocking the aerobic respiration in  the  mitochondrial  oxidative  phosphorylation  of  the  respiratory  chain,  and  leading  to  lactic  acid accumulation.  Cyanide  has  also  been  shown  to  bind  to  N-methyl-D-aspartate  receptors  and  nitric oxide synthase, resulting in increased production of the vascular relaxant, nitric oxide (NO), which likely contributes to the hypotension typically observed in victims of cyanide poisoning.

The major pathway of endogenous detoxification is conversion, by means of thiosulfate, into the less toxic  compound  thiocyanate  which  is  then  excreted  in  the  urine.  Minor  routes  of  elimination  are excretion  of  hydrogen  cyanide  through  the  lungs  and  binding  to  cysteine  or  hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B12). But they are insufficient at toxic amounts of cyanide.

## · Clinical symptoms

Symptoms of cyanide poisoning appear within seconds to minutes after inhalation and a number of immediate  fatalities  may  be  expected.  In  these  severe  cases,  clinical  signs  of  hyperventilation,  via direct stimulation of the respiratory centre and  metabolic  acidosis, are followed  by  loss of consciousness with convulsions and ultimately cardiovascular collapse and/or respiratory arrest. Other clinical signs include dizziness, weakness, palpitations, and anxiety, followed by dyspnoea, pulmonary oedema,  confusion,  ataxia,  and  paralysis.  Cyanogens  are  also  respiratory  irritants,  and  may  cause pulmonary  effects  if  the  victim  survives  asphyxia.  After  oral  administration,  symptoms  may  be delayed for about 30 minutes, sometimes more.

Cyanide concentrations less than 8 µmol/L (0.02 mg/L) are associated with no symptoms, flushing and tachycardia  appear  for  concentrations  from  20  to  40 µmol/L  (0.5  to  1 mg/L).  Poisoning  has  been reported  with  concentrations  above  40 µmol/L,  coma  and  respiratory  depression  are  reported  for concentrations from 100 to 120 µmol/L (2.5 to 3 mg/L), and fatal outcome for concentrations greater than  120 µmol/L  (3 mg/L).  Time  for  occurrence  of  symptoms  and  death  decreases  with  increasing blood cyanide concentrations. However, a serious drawback to the use of plasma cyanide determinations in the assessment of poisoning is the pronounced instability of cyanide in plasma.

In case of fire smoke inhalation, patients present with soot around the mouth, nose, and/or oropharynx. Intoxicated  patients  also  usually  present  with  altered  neurological  status.  Neurological  signs  are  a

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sensitive but not specific indicator of cyanide intoxication, but in combination with hypotension are highly suggestive of cyanide intoxication. It has to be noted that the clinical picture of this type of intoxication  is  highly  polymorphous  and  cyanide  intoxication  is  often  associated  with  carbon monoxide  intoxication,  for  which  clinical  symptoms  are  quite  similar.  According  to  animal  data, cyanide and carbon monoxide could have additive and synergistic toxicity. In humans, the presence of other toxicants such as carbon monoxide may contribute to lethal outcomes in the presence of even smaller blood cyanide concentrations.

A plasma concentration of lactate ≥ 10 mmol/l can be used as a sensitive but non-specific marker of cyanide poisoning.

## · Treatment management for Cyanide Poisoning

As there is no widely available, rapid cyanide blood assay, the presence and amount of cyanide are often initially  unknown. Treatment decision must therefore be made on the basis of clinical history and/or  signs  and  symptoms  of  cyanide  intoxication.  As  cyanide  poisoning  is  associated  with  early toxicity  and  possible  death  and  neurological  sequelae,  treatment  should  be  initiated  as  soon  as possible.  Conventional  treatment  of  cyanide  poisoning  includes  decontamination,  supportive  and specific treatment. Management of the intoxication is determined by its severity. In mild poisoning, oxygen, reassurance of the subject and bed rest without antidote, can be sufficient.

## First aid measures is decontamination that should be adapted to the exposure route:

In case of inhalation, the patient must be removed from the contaminated environment/atmosphere; as dispersion  of  the  gas  is  very  rapid,  decontamination  is  usually  not  necessary.  In  case  of  dermal exposure,  careful  removing  of  clothes  and  thorough  washing  of  the  skin  with  water  and  soap  is necessary.  In  case  of  oral  poisoning,  if  the  patient  is  stabilised  and  in  the  rare  cases  when  almost immediate  measures  can  be  applied,  the  administration  of  activated  charcoal  is  recommended  as  a primary method  for gastrointestinal decontamination. Decontamination  should  never postpone supportive treatment.

Protective measures such as masks and protective clothes are necessary for rescuers.

## Symptomatic Treatments include:

- supportive  care  including  oxygenation  with  100 %  O2  that  is  the  basic  treatment  of  such intoxication, and if necessary, mechanical ventilation (mask or/and intubation);
- management of seizures by anticonvulsants according to standard protocols;
- hypotension management by vasopressors as by standard protocols;
- arrhythmias management according to standard protocols;
- metabolic acidosis management as by standard protocols.

## Antidote treatments are available in Europe:

Nevertheless, non-clinical and clinical information on these compounds is rather limited, and medical practice  is  not  standardized  across  European  countries  and  is  based  on  availability  of  a  specific antidote and medical practice. Frequently, the simultaneous or successive administration of different antidotes has been recommended.

The European guidance document (EMEA/CPMP/1255/03) \"on the use of medicinal products for the treatment of patients exposed to terrorist attack with chemical agents\" summarizes properties of the different antidotes, which can be categorized into 3 groups:

- Complexation  agents  that  act  by  direct  binding  of  the  cyanide  ions.  Two  products  are available:
- -Dicobalt edetate which is an efficient complexation antidote to cyanide; but its use should be restricted  to  cases  when  the  diagnosis  of  cyanide  poisoning  is  certain  and  only  for  severe poisoning, since it has serious cardio-vascular adverse effects in the absence of cyanide.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Hydroxocobalamin which is  considered  to  be  the  best  choice  antidote,  if  available,  as  it  is experimentally  well  documented  with  clear  advantages  in  situations  such  as  fires  with concomitant exposure to agents that reduce oxygen transport, such as carbon monoxide.
- Sulfur supplying agents which act by promoting conversion of cyanide to thiocyanate, thus enhancing the physiological cyanide detoxification process:
- -Thiosulphate is the main product in this class; it should be considered together with the other cyanide antidotes in sequential treatment (but should no be administered as a mixture at the same time as hydroxocobalamin), as it is a rather slow acting agent.
- Methaemoglobin inducers which act by complexation of cyanide to methaemoglobin:
- -The agents belonging to this class include sodium nitrite, amyl nitrite and 4dimethylaminophenol. Due to the risk of excessive methaemoglobinemia, they should be used in case of non-availability of hydroxocobalamin or dicobalt edetate.

## About the product

Hydroxocobalamin is the biologically active form of Vitamin B12. The mechanism of action is based upon  its  ability  to  very  tightly  bind  cyanide  ions.  The  resulting  molecule,  cyanocobalamin,  is  a physiologically stable, non-toxic compound that is excreted in the urine.

Hydroxocobalamin was first demonstrated to be effective as a cyanide antidote in 1952 (Mushett). In Europe, it has been authorized in France since May 1996.

Each  vial  of  Cyanokit  2.5 g  contains  2.5 g  hydroxocobalamin  lyophilizate  is  recommended  to  be reconstituted  with  100 mL  of  sterile  saline  (0.9 %  NaCl)  solution,  or  other  diluents  as  Lactated Ringers Solution, 5 % dextrose, which have also been found to be compatible with hydroxocobalamin.

The proposed therapeutic indication for Cyanokit 2.5 g was:

'Treatment of known or suspected cyanide poisoning.'

## Scientific Advice

## 2. Quality aspects

## Introduction

Cyanokit is a sterile, lyophilised powder for solution for intravenous infusion and contains 2.5 g of hydroxocobalamin as active substance.  Each vial of Cyanokit is recommended to be reconstituted with 100 mL of sterile saline (0.9% NaCl). Other diluents (i.e., Lactated Ringers Solution, 5% dextrose) have also been found to be compatible with hydroxocobalamin. The reconstitution diluent is not provided in the final marketed product.

The only excipient is Hydrochloric acid.

The primary container consists in a single use Type II glass vials closed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminum cap with a plastic lid.

The proposed final marketed kit consists of:

- Two closed glass vials packed.
- Two sterile transfer spikes allowing the transfer of the diluent into the vial for reconstitution of the lyophilisate (sterile medical device with CE marking)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- One sterile IV infusion set (sterile medical device with CE marking)
- One  sterile  short  catheter  for  administration  to  children  (sterile  medical  device  with  CE marking)

## Active Substance

Hydroxocobalamin, the hydroxylated active form of vitamin B12, is a large molecule in which a cobalt ion is coordinated in 4 positions by a tetrapyrrole ring.  It is a hygroscopic, odourless, dark red crystalline powder that is freely soluble in water and ethanol, and practically insoluble in acetone and diethyl ether.

Information on hydroxocobalamin has been supplied in the form of an ASMF.

## · Manufacture

The manufacturing process is carried out in two stepsAdequate In-Process Controls are applied during the synthesis of the drug substance. Control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents, have been presented.

Batch  analysis  data  batches  from  the  manufacturer  are  presented  and  confirm  consistency  and uniformity of the manufacturing process.

## · Specification

The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification of the active substance (IR, HPLC), identification of cobalt, assay (HPLC, UV), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC),  acetates,  chlorides,  loss  on  drying  (Ph  Eur),  pH,  bacterial  endotoxin  (Ph  Eur),  microbial contamination (Ph Eur).

Batch analysis data of 3 commercial batches of active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

## · Stability

Stability studies were performed on three batches of a satisfactory size according to ICH program ). Results from long term storage at 5ºC±3ºC for 24 months and accelerated storage, 6 months at 25ºC±2ºC 60%RH±5%, were performed.  Loss on drying, assay by UV spectroscopy and related substances were tested on stability samples

The results support the proposed re-test and storage conditions.

## Medicinal Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The development of the manufacturing process was guided by the physicochemical properties of the active substance. Cyanokit is prepared by an aseptic process, as the stability of hydroxocobalamin is not  compatible  with  a  heat  sterilisation  process.  The  sterile  solution  is  then  freeze-dried,  as  the lyophilisate  form  significantly  improves  the  stability  of  hydroxocobalamin  compared  with  a  liquid injectable preparation.

The manufacturing process development was focused on the critical steps of the process. Compatibility  studies  were  performed  in  order  to  determine  the  compatibility  of  Cyanokit  with different drugs and diluents for IV infusion available in Europe and/or on the US market.

All formulation excipients comply with Ph Eur specifications.

Cyanokit is  packaged  in  a  type  II  colourless  (clear)  glass  vial  closed  by  a  gray  bromobutyl  rubber stopper and an aluminum cap with a plastic lid (flip-off).  The containers/closures used are composed of materials compatible with the lyophilisate and compliant with European Pharmacopoeia requirements and certified suitable for food use. The suitability of the container-closure is based on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

stability  studies  where  no  interactions  between  the  product  and  the  container-closure  system  were detected.

The Kit contains two sterile transfer spikes allowing the transfer of the diluent into the vial for reconstitution of the lyophilisate, one sterile IV infusion set, and one sterile short catheter for administration to children. They are covered by an EC marking Certificate and the reconstituted solution is compatible with the IV infusion set in the conditions of use.

The clinical formulation used in the clinical trials is identical with one proposed for marketing.

## · Manufacture of the Product

Manufacturing consists of preparation of the bulk solution, followed by prefiltration, sterile filtration and filling, lyophilisation, capping and visual check. Validation studies have been carried out by a number of studies for the major steps of the manufacturing process in 6 commercial batches  and is satisfactory. The in process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.

## · Product Specification

The drug product specifications include appropriate tests for description, identification (IR, HPLC), tests on lyohilizate (mean mass of vial contents, uniformity of dosage unit, residual humidity %, particulate contamination), tests on reconstitute solution (dissolution, pH), assay%, HPLC ), residual substances (Ph Eur), sterility (Ph Eur), and bacterial endotoxin (Ph Eur).

Batch analysis results (n=6) confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is under control. Impurity limits in the specification are justified by toxicology studies

## · Stability of the Product

Initial stability studies conducted according to ICH recommendations were performed on 3 batches of Cyanokit.  Supportive  stability  studies  conducted  according  to  ICH  recommendations  were  also performed on 2 batches of Cyanokit used for clinical studies. Primary stability data of 3 batches stored according ICH conditions (25°C/60%RH and 30°C/65%RH) for 30 months were provided.

'In-use' stability studies data for 3 batches (performed on reconstituted solution) stored for up to 24 months at 5, 25 and 40°C were also provided.

The parameters tested during stability study are identical with the release specifications.

The influence of light was studied on batch 1 batch of Cyanokit in the primary packaging.  The study was performed on the finished product and on reconstituted solution of sterile  saline  (0.9%  NaCl). Vials were exposed to light in the photostability cabinet according to the recommendations of the ICH Guideline Q1B 'Photostability testing of new active substances and medicinal products.'

Temperature, humidity, temperature and humidity, oxidation studies were performed  with both the reconstituted and unreconstituted product.

Vials were exposed to 3 different thermal cycles simulating the variations of temperature during usual transport , transport in the desert and freezing/defrosting cycles.

As a conclusion from the stability  studies,  the  results  indicate  satisfactory  stability  and  support  the shelf life and conditions of used stated in the SPC.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. At the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe.

## 3. Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

The non-clinical testing strategy was designed to supplement historical non-clinical and clinical data that were published in the literature. New toxicity studies comprised pivotal IV studies in the dog, a standard battery of genotoxicity studies, an in vitro phototoxicity study, studies in rats to investigate the toxicity of batches with high levels of impurities and a 14-day repeated dose study in dogs with the detoxification product, cyanocobalamin.

The  non-clinical  studies  specifically  conducted  in  support  of  this  application  were  carried  out  in accordance with current guidance and in compliance with the principles of GLP.

However it has been reported that the laboratory used for the validation of the bioanalytical methods for measurement of 'total' and 'free' cobalamins and cyanocobalamin in plasma,'total' cobalamins in human  urine,  was  not  fully  compliant  with  GLP  principles  during  the  period  the  studies  were conducted.  The  non-compliance  involved  inappropriate  integration  of  chromatographic  data.  The EMEA and all European member states were advised of this inspection conclusion.

Concerned studies were dog efficacy, single dose rat and dog toxicity studies. The review of the bioanalytical data concluded on the absence of impact on the safety factors originally calculated from these studies.

## Pharmacology

- Primary pharmacodynamics

## In vitro

The rationale for administering hydroxocobalamin as an antidote to cyanide poisoning is based on the high affinity of the cyanide ion for cobalt compounds. Hydroxocobalamin (OHCo) is a natural form of Vitamin  B12, each molecule  containing  a trivalent cobalt ion carrying a hydroxo  ligand. It stoichiometrically  binds  cyanide  ions  by  substituting  the  hydroxo  ligand  to  form  cyanocobalamin. This reaction is supposed to occur primarily in blood.

One study performed in vitro on human cyanide-loaded fibroblasts showed that OHCo can penetrate in the cells and complex cyanide to form CNCo. Cyanocobalamin is very stable and is excreted in the urine.

## In vivo

A primary pharmacodynamic study in cyanide-poisoned dogs was conducted at 75 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg to support the efficacy of hydroxocobalamin in the proposed indication. The selection of the animal model for the efficacy study was based on pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic similarities between dog and man as well as some practical considerations such as blood volume to be withdrawn to accommodate all relevant pharmacodynamic and PK endpoints.

Cyanide poisoning may result from exposure to smoke from closed space fires, inhalation, ingestion or dermal exposure. In the clinical setting, particularly for the treatment of individuals exposed to smoke, exposure to cyanide occurs mainly via inhalation. However in the dog efficacy study, cyanide was administered intravenously.

The choice of route was justified based on the observation that cyanide poisoning by all routes results in similar signs and symptoms, as well as a similar distribution pattern, although the rate of onset of poisoning  differs  and  is  also  dose-dependent.  The  intravenous  route  allowed  the  most  controlled administration  to  produce  defined  apnoea  and  continue  infusion  for  a  further  3  minutes  to  ensure

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

potentially lethal exposure. Oral absorption is variable and would allow less control of the study, and administration by inhalation presents even more practical difficulties.

Mortality data showed that the survival of Cyanokit-treated animals 4 hours and 15 days after cyanidepoisoning  was  increased  compared  to  vehicle-treated  ones.  Survival  at  day  15  was  superior  in  the high-dose  group  (100%)  compared  to  the  low-dose  group  (79%).  Furthermore,  Cyanokit  treatment allowed  a  more  rapid  recovery  of  cardiovascular  parameters  and  respiratory  function.  A  protective effect against cyanide-induced brain lesions in terms of incidence and severity was demonstrated at 150 mg/kg, and partially shown at 75 mg/kg.

No lesions were interpreted to be related to hydroxocobalamin administration at the histopathological examination.

Kinetic data support the proposed mechanism of action for hydroxocobalamin, i.e. cyanide trapping. In  Cyanokit-treated  animals,  the  initial  decrease  in  cyanide  concentration  paralleled  the  increase  in cyanocobalamin concentration.

Overall,  both  the  75  mg/kg  and  150  mg/kg  dose  levels  were  effective  in  the  treatment  of  cyanide poisoning in dogs. The therapeutic dose proposed in humans (5.0 g, equivalent to 75 mg/kg) is in the range of the effective doses tested in dogs.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

Hydroxocobalamin was shown to possess a NO-scavenging property in anesthetized rabbits treated by IV  route.  This  resulted  in  increased  mean  arterial  blood  pressure  and  total  peripheral  resistance, together  with  decreased  cardiac  output.  An  increase  in  blood  pressure  has  also  been  observed  in treated patients (see clinical safety). Cyanocobalamin, the reaction product of hydroxocobalamin with cyanide, did not possess this NO-scavenging property.

## · Safety pharmacology programme

No special safety pharmacology study was performed. However, the effect of hydroxocobalamin on various  parameters  related  to  cardiac  function  was  evaluated  in  repeated-dose  toxicity  studies conducted in dogs. The results showed that ECG-parameters such as heart rate, PQ-, QRS- and QTinterval (including QT-correction according to Van de Water) were not influenced by hydroxocobalamin  treatment.  Considering  the  CNS  and  the  respiratory  system,  specific  safety pharmacology  studies  were  neither  conducted.  However,  in  the  efficacy  study  in  cyanide-poisoned dogs, the recovery of cardiovascular parameters and respiratory function was more rapid in Cyanokittreated animals than in control ones. Additionally, a protective effect against cyanide-induced brain lesions in terms of incidence and severity was shown in Cyanokit-treated dogs.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

## No studies have been conducted

## Pharmacokinetics

## Methods of analysis

Hydroxocobalamin  reacts  with  plasma  constituents  to  form  various  cobalamin-(III)  complexes.  A rapid ligand exchange was shown with coordinative amino acid residues such as histidine and cysteine to form high molecular non-filterable plasma protein complexes, and with low molecular ligands such as thiols, histidine and thiocyanate forming so-called 'free cobalamins-(III)'. Such coordinative ligand exchanges are known to be equilibrium reactions, which proceed much more slowly than the usual non-covalent  protein  binding  of  drugs.  The  HPLC-UV  method  developed  by  the  applicant  to determine free cobalamins-(III) and total cobalamins-(III) levels is considered properly validated. It is based on the property of cobalamin complexes to form cyanocobalamin quantitatively in the presence of excess cyanide. Additionally, the HPLC-UV method developed to determine cyanocobalamin levels after the administration of cyanocobalamin or its formation in vivo (pharmacological study in cyanidepoisoned dogs) is also considered validated.

Absorption

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No studies were conducted and are not needed as Cyanokit is administered intravenously.

## Distribution

The distribution of hydroxocobalamin is influenced by coordinative binding to proteins, with the hydroxo ligand being replaced by histidine and thiol groups of proteins to form cobalamin-(III) complexes. Equilibrium is reached within 1 to 2 hours after infusion of hydroxocobalamin. The free fraction of cobalamin-(III) varies between species (5% in humans, 16% in dogs and 24% in rats). Although tissue distribution was not specifically studied, indirect evidence suggests that distribution follows the physiological organs of storage of vitamin B12 which are the liver, kidneys and nervous system.

## Metabolism

The binding of hydroxocobalamin to proteins may be regarded as reversible metabolism. Hydroxocobalamin also reacts with cyanide thereby forming cyanocobalamin. This complex is highly stable and is therefore regarded as a physiological end product of hydroxocobalamin especially during cyanide intoxication.

## Excretion

Both hydroxocobalamin and cyanocobalamin are excreted mainly via the kidneys in dogs. In human volunteers,  hydroxocobalamin  was  also  excreted  mainly  via  the  renal  route  (58-74%  of  total clearance).  The  mean  half-lives  for  'free'  cobalamins  were  3h  in  the  rat,  6h  in  the  dog  and  28h  in humans. For cyanocobalamin, the half-lives were 0.3 to 0.5h in rats, 0.8 to 1h in dogs and 9.3 ± 3.2 hours in humans.

## PK drug interactions

No studies were conducted. Due to the high molecular weight of hydroxocobalamin, interaction with drug metabolising enzymes such as CYP P450 is unlikely to occur. In addition, since hydroxocobalamin is intended for single administration, induction studies were also considered unnecessary.

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

In rats, the approximate LD50  of hydroxocobalamin ranged from 720 to 1200 mg/kg  by intraperitoneal  route.  In  dogs,  the  toxicity  of  hydroxocobalamin  was  studied  by  IV  route  after administration of a single dose (150, 300 and 1200 mg/kg). Clinical signs included red coloured urine, skin and mucous membranes and subcutaneous oedema around the head. It was considered unlikely that  the  subcutaneous edema could be due to an immediate allergic reaction mediated by histamine release.

## · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

In dogs, in addition to single doses (150, 300 and 1200 mg/kg), the toxicity of hydroxocobalamin was studied by IV route after administration of repeated doses (300, 600 and 1200 mg/kg/day for 3 days 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks). Platelet count was decreased in all these studies. Liver and kidneys were the main target organs. At the biochemistry level, liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP) were increased in  all  the  studies  but  returned  to  baseline  levels  after  withdrawal  of  the  treatment.  At  the histopathological level, changes were attributed to an overload phenomenon. They occurred at ≥ 300 mg/kg and at ≥ 75 mg/kg in the single dose study and in repeat-dose studies, respectively, and were possibly  associated  with  reactive  and  degenerative  changes  mainly  in  repeat-dose  studies.  Other kidney  findings  observed  in  the  single  dose  study  at  1200  mg/kg  and  in  the  3-day  study  at ≥ 600 mg/kg were related to the redistribution of plasma water from the intravascular to the extravascular space occurring after hydroxocobalamin administration. This mechanism was also probably involved in the decrease in platelet count.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Single  cell  necroses,  affecting  mainly  macrophages,  were  observed  at  all  dose  levels  in  the  bone marrow. However, they did not impact either the cellularity of the bone marrow, or the bone marrow functioning.  Moreover,  histopathological  examination  in  the  4-week  toxicity  study  showed  a  trend towards recovery in terms of incidence and severity.

Adverse  effects  were  observed  in  other  organs/tissues  in  3-day  and  4-week  studies.  In  the  3-day toxicity  study,  heart  alterations  occurring  at  the  top  dose  of  1200  mg/kg/day  and  spleen  alterations observed at 600 and 1200 mg/kg/day were attributed to redistribution of plasma water. In the 4-week study, heart and spleen findings were also observed and were considered to result from a non specific inflammatory reaction and from the overload phenomenon, respectively.

Taking into consideration the nature and reversibility of the effects reported in the single dose study, a single dose of 300 mg/kg is considered as well tolerated in dogs.

With  the  exception  of  liver  fibrosis  reported  at  300  mg/kg  in  the  4-week  study,  all  the  treatmentrelated  findings  observed  in  repeat-dose  studies  were  either  fully  reversible  or  showed  a  trend  to recovery after  8  weeks  of  treatment-free  period.  Liver  fibrosis  likely  results  from  the  inflammatory reaction  reported  after  4-week  treatment  and  as  a  sequel  of  the  observed  sinusoid  edema  related  to redistribution  of  plasma  water  and  overload  phenomenon.  Therefore,  the  risk  of  hepatic  fibrosis resulting from the therapeutic use of Cyanokit seems unlikely. In view of the nature of the adverse effects  reported  at ≤ 150  mg/kg/day,  of  their  full  or  on-going  reversibility  after  a  8-week  recovey period, and of the toxicological concerns in patients arising from cyanide-poisoning itself, the dose of 150 mg/kg/day can be considered as a NOAEL.

Cyanocobalamin, the reaction product of hydroxocobalamin and cyanide was administered intravenously to dogs for 2 weeks (40, 100 and 400 mg/kg/day). Kidney findings consistent with an overload  phenomenon,  and  bone  marrow  finding  similar  to  those  reported  with  hydroxocobalamin were observed at the high dose level. Considering this NOAEL in dogs and cyanocobalamin levels in intoxicated victims treated with hydroxocobalamin, safety factors based on Cmax ranged form 1 to 3.

## · Genotoxicity

Hydroxocobalamin was non-genotoxic in a standard battery of in vitro (Ames tests, TK +/-mouse lymphoma assays) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) tests.

## · Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed. This is considered acceptable in the absence of genotoxic potential and because Cyanokit will be administered once (or at most twice) as an IV infusion over 15 minutes.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

Only limited embryo-foetal toxicity studies are available in rats and rabbits, and do not allow to draw any clear conclusion on the embryotoxic potential of hydroxocobalamin. However, it should be noted that no teratogenic effect was reported in both species, which is adequately reported in the SPC section 5.3. In order to complete the knowledge in this area, the applicant committed to perform GLP embryofetal toxicity studies in rats and rabbits according to current standards as a follow-up measure. No studies on fertility and on peri/postnatal development were performed, which is clearly reported in the SPC sections 4.6 and 5.3. Offspring's studies (dosing of juvenile animals) have not been conducted either.

## · Toxicokinetic data

Toxicokinetics of hydroxocobalamin were studied in rats and in dogs after single administration. In dogs,  the  AUCs  of  free  cobalamins-(III)  and  total  cobalamins-(III)  increased  proportionally  to  the dose.  Mean Cmax measured for free- and total cobalamins-(III) were 1 to 5 fold higher than those measured  in  humans  treated  with  5.0  and  10.0  g  hydroxocobalamin.  Terminal  half-lives  reached

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

approximately 6 and 8 hours for free and total cobalamins-(III), respectively in dogs. Corresponding figures in rats amounted to 3 and 5 hours. In dogs, the clearance of total cobalamins-(III) (0.064 to 0.083 L/h/kg) was 6-7 fold lower than clearance of free cobalamins-(III).

In rats and dogs administered cyanocobalamin intravenously, TK data show that AUC increased in a dose-related manner, but less than dose proportionally. This is partly due to the increased clearance at higher doses. Cyanocobalamin did not accumulate after repeated administrations in both species. This is in agreement with the short half lives calculated in rats and in dogs for cyanocobalamin.

## · Local tolerance

Local  tolerance  was  evaluated  in  dog  toxicity  studies.  No  clinical  or  histopathological  treatmentrelated effect was noted at the injection sites.

- Other toxicity studies

## Studies on impurities

Batches of drug product containing impurities at a level up to 10.2% (after storage in stressed conditions) were no more toxic in an acute IP study in female rats than a batch with 2.3% impurities, with similar findings and LD50 values. These batches were also negative in an Ames test. The results of further qualification studies will be submitted in post-authorisation (follow-up measure). In addition, as all impurities are cobalamin-related products, there is no concern for the clinical use of the therapeutic batches.

## Phototoxicity

Hydroxocobalamin was tested for phototoxic potential in vitro in Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts using the Neutral Red uptake assay. Concentrations of 0.316 to 1000 µ g/mL were used in the presence and absence of UV-A irradiation. There were no significant increases in Neutral Red uptake in the presence than in the absence of UV-A.

Therefore, hydroxocobalamin is not considered to have a phototoxic potential. Although no phototoxicity studies have been performed with cyanocobalamin, the clinical experience suggests that the risk of phototoxicity in also unlikely.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

As a vitamin, hydroxocobalamin is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment and an environmental risk assessment is not necessary. Nevertheless the Applicant provided a calculation of the  predicted  environmental concentration (PEC) for hydroxocobalamin in the aquatic compartment based on a refinement of the marketing penetration factor resulting in a refined PEC value below the 0.01µg/l  threshold.  However,  it  should  be  mentioned  that  any  PEC  refinement  at  this  stage  is  not acceptable unless it is based on published data, e.g. epidemiological studies or medicine statistics.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

In the dog efficacy model, Cyanokit significantly improved survival following cyanide administration, and produced a more rapid recovery of cardiovascular and respiratory parameters compared with controls.

Hydroxocobalamin binds coordinatively to plasma proteins and also reacts with cyanide forming cyanocobalamin which is a highly stable complex. In dogs and in humans, both hydroxocobalamin and cyanocobalamin are mainly excreted in the urine.

Hydroxocobalamin has a low acute toxicity. The main target organs of toxicity in repeat-dose studies were the liver, kidney and bone marrow, with findings suggestive of tissue overload with high quantities of hydroxocobalamin. Similar findings were seen in a repeated dose study with cyanocobalamin.

No genotoxic potential have been identified in a standard tests battery. The carcinogenic potential was not studied which is acceptable in view of the toxicological profile and the indication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Data on the reproductive potential are limited and this is reflected adequately in the SPC. In order to complete the knowledge in this area, embryo-foetal studies (rats and rabbits) will be performed as a post-authorisation commitment (follow-up measure).

No significant risk to the environment is expected.

## 4. Clinical aspects

## Introduction

Because of ethical considerations, no placebo-controlled clinical study of the efficacy of hydroxocobalamin  in  acute  cyanide  poisoning  was  performed.  To  overcome  this  lack,  a  primary pharmacodynamics  study  was  performed  in  cyanide-exposed  dogs  to  support  the  efficacy  of hydroxocobalamin in the proposed indication. (See section non-clinical aspects)

The  clinical  dossier  comprises  1  safety  study  with  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  evaluation  as  secondary objective,  and  4  non  comparative  efficacy  studies  (one  prospective  study  and  three  retrospective reports)  in  the  contexts  of  suspected  cyanide-poisoning  due  to  fire  smoke  inhalation  and  of  known cyanide-poisoning.

Overall,  347  subjects  were  exposed  to  hydroxocobalamin  in  submitted  clinical  studies;  102  were healthy volunteers who received doses comprised between 2.5 and 10 g; and 245 were subjects with suspected or known cyanide-poisoning.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The 3 retrospective reports did neither require submission to an Ethics Committee nor signed informed consent from subjects.

## Pharmacokinetics

Hydroxocobalamin  is  intended  for  the  treatment  of  cyanide  intoxication  (known  or  suspected)  in emergency situation. The IV route is therefore the most appropriate as it allows a rapid disposition of the drug.

The sponsor has conducted a single-ascending dose study in healthy volunteers (study EML 015722H101) and has provided sparse data in patients from published literature.

## Analytical methods

An HPLC-UV method was employed and the non-protein-bound cobalamin-(III) is referred to as freecobalamins-(III).  Total  cobalamin-(III)  referred  to  the  sum  of  free  and  protein-bound  fraction.  The analytical  technique  is  adequately  documented  and  a  full  validation  report  is  provided.  However, comparison  of  data  obtained  in  healthy  volunteers  from  the  study  performed  by  the  applicant  with published data from literature should be made cautiously.

## Study EML 015722-H101

## Methods

This  study  investigated  the  PK  behaviour  of  hydroxocobalamin  after  administration  by  IV  route  in adult  healthy  volunteers  This  was  a  double  blind,  placebo  controlled,  single-ascending-dose  study, with a 4-week follow-up, of the safety, tolerability and PK of 4 intravenous doses (2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 g)  of  hydroxocobalamin  in  healthy  volunteers.  The  primary  objective  was  to  test  the  safety  and tolerability of the four single intravenous doses and the second objective was the determination of the pharmacokinetics of the free and total cobalamins-(III) in plasma and the total-cobalamin-(III) in the urine in a subgroup of 9 subjects (for the 2.5, 5 and 7.5 g doses) and 12 subjects (10 g dose). For all doses  the  infusion  rate  of  hydroxocobalamin  was  1g/3  minutes.  Plasma  concentrations  were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adequately monitored over a 96 h time period (19 time points). Urine samples were collected over a 72 h time period post dosing.

## Results

## · Distribution

Following IV infusion of 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 g of hydroxocobalamin at a constant rate of approximately 1 g/3 minutes,  free  cobalamin-(III)  reached  maximum  concentrations  generally  at  the  end  of  the infusion. Fast complexation of hydroxocobalamin with plasma proteins is suggested by the findings of the  study  as  Tmax  observed  for  the  free-cobalamins-(III)  is  very  close  to  that  observed  with  totalcobalamins-(III).

The  volume  of  distribution  at  steady-state  (Vss)  for  both  free  and  total  cobalamins-(III)  is  not dependant upon the administrated dose. Vss ranged from 280.7 up to 349.5 L for the free cobalamins(III)  and  from  21.8  up  to  25.6  L  for  total  cobalamins-(III).  This  could  be  explained  by  the  rapid distribution of free-cobalamins-(III) into tissues.

## · Elimination

Cobalamins  (free  and  total)  are  slowly  eliminated  from  plasma  as  the  apparent  plasma  elimination half-live  is  approximately  30  h.  The  Cmax  and  AUC  of  both  free  and  total  cobalamins  evolve proportionally to the dose over the studied range (2.5 up to 10 g). Cmax values ranged from 73.1 up to 197.2 µg eq/ml for free-cobalamins-(III) and from 287.6 up to 995.3 µg eq/ml for total cobalamins(III). AUC0-t values ranged from 188.4 up to 762.5 µg eq/ml*h for free cobalamins-(III) and 3566 up to 14271.5 µg eq/ml*h. Estimated from AUC ratios, the systemic exposure to free cobalamins-(III) is approximately 5 % that of total cobalamins-(III).

## · Excretion

Kidney is a major route of elimination as up to 74 % of the administered dose is recovered in the urine. The total body clearance (CL) of free cobalamins-(III) ranged from 12.5 up to 13.2 L/h , which exceeds  the normal glomerular filtration rate (approximately 4.8 up to 7.9 L/h).. This high clearance may  be  due  to  the  extensive  binding  of  free  cobalamins  to  plasma  proteins.  Clearance  of  total cobalamins-(III) ranged from 0.566 to 0.645 L/h across all doses.

Overall, the PK profile obtained is well characterized with a linear PK behaviour of hydroxocobalamin over the range of the tested doses (2.5 to 10g).

However, the PK behaviour in cyanide-intoxicated patient may be quite divergent from that observed in healthy volunteers as hydroxocobalamin reacts with cyanide. The lack of PK investigation in the patients is considered acceptable with views of ethical and feasibility constraints.

Additional  sparse  data  from  literature  are  reported  in  the  application  documentation.  Among  them studies performed by Houeto et al. (1995), Houeto et al. (1996) and Astier and Baud (1995) are of interest.  These studies evidenced the formation of cyanocobalamin formation in patients exposed to cyanide.  A  correlation  between  blood  cyanide  levels  and  cyanocobalamin  is  suggested  by  these studies.  The  concentrations  of  cyanocobalamin  in  humans,  following  high  cyanide  exposure  and subsequent IV administration of 5 g of hydroxocobalamin, were in the range of 212.4 ± 30.9 µmol/L (282±41  µg  eq/mL)  in  Houeto  et  al.  (1996)  study  and  227  ±  95  µmol/L  (302±126  µg  eq/mL)    in Houeto et al. (1995) study.

## · Special populations

There are no known differences in the PK of hydroxocobalamin in older versus younger subjects. The basis for paediatric recommendations is discussed further. (See further sub-section 'special populations').

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

No interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Mechanism of action

Hydroxocobalamin is a natural form of Vitamin B12 that was first demonstrated to be effective as a cyanide antidote in 1952, and that has been used in clinical practice for more than 30 years.

Hydroxocobalamin is a complexation agent that acts by direct binding of the cyanide ions, resulting in cyanocobalamin which is a highly stable, nontoxic compound that is excreted in the urine.

In addition, increased blood pressure observed in some healthy subjects of the phase I clinical study and  results  of  a  non-clinical  study  performed  in  anesthetized  rabbits  suggest  an  interference  of hydroxocobalamin with the NO system.

## · Primary and Secondary pharmacology

Pharmacodynamic  properties  have  been  studied  in  non-clinical  models.  For  ethical  reasons,  a controlled  clinical  efficacy  study  on  the  antidotal  properties  of  hydroxocobalamin  against  cyanidepoisoning could not be performed.

Therefore, the applicant conducted a primary pharmacodynamic study in cyanide-poisoned dogs to support the efficacy (see section 'Non-clinical aspects').

## Clinical efficacy

In support of efficacy of hydroxocobalamin in cyanide poisoning, 4 non-comparative clinical studies were submitted as shown in the next table. These studies include:

- -1 prospective efficacy study with additional retrospective safety data collection (Baud study 1), and 2  supportive  retrospective  studies  (Baud  study  2  and  Fortin  study)  in  situation  of  suspected cyanide-poisoning consecutive to fire smoke inhalation;
- -1 retrospective study (Baud Study 3) in cyanide exposure from sources other than fire smoke.

Due  to  ethical  aspects  linked  to  potential  seriousness  of  cyanide  poisoning,  no  clinical  placebocontrolled study was performed. To overcome this lack, a non clinical study placebo-controlled was performed in dogs as primary evidence of efficacy (see section 'Non-clinical aspects').

## · Dose response studies

The initial 5.0 g dose of hydroxocobalamin used in the clinical studies was based on in vitro data, nonclinical data in cyanide-poisoned dogs and on clinical experience.

- -In  vitro data  (Kaczka et  al. ,  1950;  Marques  HM et  al. ,  1988)  showed  stoichiometric  binding  of hydroxocobalamin to cyanide, which would predict that 5.0 g could neutralize a single lethal dose of cyanide. However, a PK study in cyanide-poisoned victims ( Houeto, 1995 ) suggested that larger doses  of  hydroxocobalamin  may  be  required  due  to  less  than  stoichiometric  binding in  vivo . Additional clinical experience suggested a benefit of a second dose in more serious poisonings.
- -The preclinical controlled efficacy study N106342 evaluated 2 doses of hydroxocobalamin, 75 and 150 mg/kg  in  dogs.  The  observed  increase  in  survival  at  150 mg/kg  compared  with  75 mg/kg, further supported the assumption of less than stoichiometric binding in vivo as the 75 mg/kg would have been expected to neutralize the entire delivered dose of potassium cyanide. The absence of complete stoichiometric binding is probably due to the competitive binding of hydroxocobalamin to (plasma) proteins and other small molecular ligands.
- -The safety/tolerance study EML015722-H101 performed in healthy subjects evaluated pharmacokinetics of 4 doses of hydroxocobalamin (2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 g) as secondary objective. This study revealed the linear PK behaviour of hydroxocobalamin over the range of tested doses, and suggested no major differences in the plasma PK parameters of free and total cobalamins-(III) between men and women.

Regarding dose per body weight or Cmax of total cobalamins-(III), the 75 and 150 mg/kg doses studied in  dogs  are  approximately  equivalent  to  5.0  and  10.0 g  in  humans  respectively  (see  table  below). Based on these considerations, a comparable extent of cyanide detoxification as observed in the dog efficacy study is expected in humans.

| 150 mg/kg, Male                   | 1139 ± 175                        | 995.3 ± 149.1                             | 10.0 g                                    |
| 150 mg/kg, Female                 | 1263 ± 145                        | 995.3 ± 149.1                             | 10.0 g                                    |

Therefore, based on experimental data and clinical practice, a 5.0 g dose (approximately 70 mg/kg) of hydroxocobalamin appears to be an appropriate starting dose for the treatment of cyanide poisoning in humans. A 2 nd dose can be administered, based on poisoning severity and on clinical response.

## · Main studies

Two main studies in 2 different situations were provided:

- -one prospective study (Baud Study 1) in suspected cyanide-poisoning consecutive to fire smoke inhalation;
- -one retrospective study (Baud Study 3) in cyanide-poisoning following ingestion or inhalation of cyanide or cyanogenic compounds.

## METHODS

## Prospective study in suspected cyanide intoxication due to fire smoke (Baud Study 1)

## Objectives

Baud Study 1 was a prospective, uncontrolled, open-label study to evaluate efficacy of hydroxocobalamin  in  subjects  with  suspected  cyanide  exposure  due  to  fire  smoke  inhalation. Additional cardiovascular safety data were retrospectively collected. The study was conducted over approximately 7 years between 1987 and 1994, in the Fernand Widal Hospital in Paris, France, known as a French reference treatment centre for poisoning cases.

## Study participants

Subjects  were  eligible  for  the  study  if  they  were  over  15  years  of  age,  suspected  of  cyanide intoxication due to smoke inhalation, with soot in the mouth and expectoration, and had disturbances of higher function such as confusion or slowness of thought, or an altered neurological status defined as either impaired consciousness as evidenced by coma, drowsiness, restlessness or transient loss of consciousness when found by the rescue workers.

Cyanide intoxication was confirmed a posteriori by assay of the blood sample taken at the fire scene. The thresholds for toxic blood cyanide (BCN) concentration and potentially lethal BCN concentration were predefined as ≥ 39 µmol/L and ≥ 100 µmol/L, respectively.

Subjects  with  multiple  traumas,  with  second  or  third  degree  burns  over  at  least  20 %  of  the  body surface area, or with severe burns on the face and neck were excluded from the study. Women who were pregnant were also excluded from the study.

## Treatments

Subjects were treated with a solution of 5.0 g of hydroxocobalamin in 100 mL of water for injection (approximately 70 mg/kg) by intravenous (IV) infusion, over 15 to 30 minutes at the accident scene or in the ICU at hospital admission. Depending on the clinical response, the infusion could be repeated once or twice. The maximum total dose could not exceed 15.0 g of hydroxocobalamin. Symptomatic treatments, mainly oxygen via a mask or after intubation were administered to all patients. Supportive care were performed based on the patient's condition. As smoke inhalation involves intoxication with a variety  of  toxicants  in  addition  to  cyanide,  including  carbon  monoxide,  the  latter  was  treated  with normobaric and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes/endpoints

Subjects were evaluated at the accident scene before receiving hydroxocobalamin, at the end of the hydroxocobalamin infusion, upon arrival in the hospital, and on days 1, 2, and 3 post-intoxication. Efficacy  parameters  included:  survival,  systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP)  and  diastolic  blood  pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), and neurological status. Biological parameters included blood concentrations of cyanide and carbon monoxide, and plasma lactate concentrations.

## Statistical methods

Since this was a non-comparative study only descriptive statistics were generated and sample size was no predefined.

The analysis  was  performed  in  all  included  patients  (Intention  To  Treat);  and  in  subpopulations  of patients defined according to initial BCN concentration, and to presence or absence of initial cardiac arrest.

## Retrospective study in cyanide intoxication from sources other than fire smoke (Baud Study 3)

## Objectives

The objective of this retrospective study was to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxocobalamin in patients with 'pure' cyanide poisoning, not involving fire smoke inhalation.

## Study participants

Database  of  admissions  to  the  toxicological  ICU  of  2  French  hospitals  (Fernand  Widal  and Lariboisière  Hospitals)  was  reviewed  to  identify  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  cyanide  poisoning  by ingestion or inhalation and treated with hydroxocobalamin since the first use of hydroxocobalamin in these hospitals in 1988 and until 2003. Cases involving smoke inhalation were excluded.

## Treatments

Patients received hydroxocobalamin as soon as possible, in addition to standard supportive therapy. The initial dose was 5 g (approximately 70 mg/kg) by IV infusion with a maximum dose of 20g.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The observation period included the prehospital medical intervention at the scene of the intoxication and hospitalization period in ICU or other departments. Retrospective collection of data was based on the review of medical files from ICU. Efficacy variables included survival, changes in neurological status and vital signs.

## Statistical methods

Because of the retrospective non-comparative design, all results were presented descriptively without any statistical hypothesis testing.

## RESULTS

## Baud Study 1

## Participants flow

Approximately 18% (15/84) of patients were not analysed. These patients received hydroxocobalamin on the scene but were not admitted to the Fernand Widal Hospital and most of them met predefined exclusion criteria, mainly age below 15 years or severe extensive burns which could interfere with the assessment of the antidote efficacy. Since these patients were not included in the study, related data are rather limited and do not allow further analysis.

## Baseline data

Demographic and other baseline characteristics are summarized in the table below:

Overall, 69 adult patients (36 women and 33 men) were included, median age 44 (20-94) years old, of whom 15 were 65 years old or older. Initial cardiac arrest was reported in 15 patients and altered neurological status in 66 patients, of whom 39 in coma.

Blood  cyanide  concentration  (BCN)  was  assayed  in  63  patients;  42  (67%)  of  them  had  BCN ≥ 39 µmol/L. Therefore, suspicion of cyanide intoxication based on clinical history and/or signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication such as presence of soot in the mouth or expectoration and altered neurological  status  was  justified  in  at  least  67%  cases.  The  highest  BCN  concentrations  were observed in patients with initial cardiac arrest.

Assessment of carbon monoxide concentrations showed that most subjects had mixed intoxications, as 57 patients (82.6%) had carbon monoxide intoxication.

The total hydroxocobalamin median dose used in this study was 5 g (range from 4.0 to 15.0 g) and varied according to the clinical state and course of the patient. The highest doses were given to the patients in the most critical condition.

A total of 19 deaths (27%) occurred in the study; 13 of these 19 patients were found in cardiac arrest at  the  accident  scene.  Among  the  15  patients  who  had  initial  cardiac  arrest,  13  deaths  (87%) occurred, whereas 6 deaths (11%) occurred among the 54 patients who did not have initial cardiac arrest. Among the 42 patients with initial BCN concentrations ≥ 39 µmol/L ( median :  96.1 µmol/L, range : 40 to 250 µmol/L) 14 died (33.3%) and percentage of deaths increased with BCN, whereas 3 subjects died (14%) among the 21 non-intoxicated subjects ( median BCN: 8.1 µmol/L, range : 0 to 27 µmol/L).

Most patients had a favourable neurological outcome, apart from decerebration in patients with initial cardiac arrest. Neurological symptoms initially present in 66 patients improved with no sequelae in 38  cases.  Nine  patients  had  neuropsychiatric  sequelae  at  discharge  as  psychomotor  retardation, memory impairment, confusion, intellectual deterioration, dementia, aphasia, or cerebellar syndrome.

In  the  intoxicated  subjects,  the  median  SBP  generally  started  to  increase  before  the  end  of  the hydroxocobalamin  infusion  and  remained  at  the  same  level  1  hour  thereafter.  In  non-cyanidepoisoned subjects, hemodynamic status was generally stable.

In  smoke  inhalation  victims,  baseline  plasma  lactate  concentration ≥ 10 mmol/L  appears  to  be  a sensitive  marker  of  cyanide  intoxication,  as  the  highest  lactate  concentrations  were  observed  in patients with confirmed cyanide intoxication and in those with initial cardiac arrest.

These results suggest that survival outcome is strongly correlated with cardiac arrest, and severity of neurological impairments and of the intoxication.

Overall, the response to hydroxocobalamin was assessed as positive by the investigator in 31 patients (44.9%), partial in 15 patients (21.7%), and absent in 10 patients (14.5%). The response was assessed as  unknown  in  13  patients,  when  the  documentation  available  in  the  prehospital  or  ICU  patient

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

records was insufficient for the assessment of the response. The positive response rate was higher in patients with severe states (initial BCN ≥ 39 µmol/L and/or initial cardiac arrest).

## Baud Study 3

## Demographic and baseline data

Medical files of 14 subjects, 12 males and 2 females, with known cyanide poisoning treated with hydroxocobalamin as first line antidote were reviewed. The mean age was 36.3 ± 13.2 years with a range from 14.8 to 64.0 years.

Age, gender, type of cyanide ingested or inhaled, circumstances of cyanide poisoning are summarized in the table below:

Among  determined  blood  cyanide  concentrations,  11  out  of  12  exceeded  100 µmol/L  which  is usually defined as the lethal threshold, and reached values above 200 µmol/L in 3 cases. One case was  reported  as  mild  poisoning  resulted  from  inhalation  of  cyanogen  bromide  in  an  occupational accident. Circumstances of poisoning of the last case were unknown, the subject was a 50 years old man with  history  of  depression,  found  with  altered  consciousness  and  ventricular  fibrillation,  and toxicological  analysis  during  hopitalization  revealed  blood  cyanide  concentration  of  103 µmol/L. Overall, clinical features revealed serious poisoning as 2 patients were found in cardiac arrest, 4 were found in shock, and 5 patients had GCS of 3.

## Conduct of the study

Patients received hydroxocobalamin as soon as possible, in addition to standard supportive therapy. The initial dose was 5 g (approximately 70 mg/kg) by IV infusion. The dose could be repeated in case of incomplete or transient response. Hydroxocobalamin was the only cyanide antidote used in 9 of the 14  cases;  it  was  associated  with  sodium  thiosulphate  in  4  cases,  and  with  sodium  thiosulphate  and dicobalt edetate in 1 case. The median total dose of hydroxocobalamin administered at the scene plus the hospital ICU was 10 g with a range from 5 to 20 g.

Individual patient data on hydroxocobalamin treatment and associated antidotes are presented in the table below.

*: estimated time

One patient received dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite) 200 mg and dimethylsuccinic acid 400 mg for associated  mercury  poisoning.  Four  patients  received  sodium  thiosulphate  and  1 patient  received sodium thiosulphate and dicobalt edetate, in addition to hydroxocobalamin.

Based  on  clinical  evidence  of  need  for  repeated  dose,  multiple  doses  of  hydroxocobalamin  were frequently required in these primarily suicidal ingestions. Only 5 subjects received a single 5 g dose, 7 subjects required a total dose of 9-10 g, 1 subject required 15 g and 1 received 20 g hydroxocobalamin.  All  patients  with  cyanide  ingestion  had  stomach  pumped  out.  Most  patients required oxygenation. Two patients found in cardiac arrest underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Six patients received a catecholamine at the scene of poisoning or on hospital admission. Two patients required  catecholamine  treatment  within  the  2  first  days  following  hospital  admission.  The  most concomitant  medications  were  plasma  substitutes  and  crystalloid  infusion  solutions,  antipsychotics, anesthetics, and cardiac therapy.

## Outcomes and estimation

The lack of a control group and the retrospective design of this study limit to descriptive analysis of the results and do not allow quantitative analysis of the effect of hydroxocobalamin.

Survival outcome, blood cyanide concentration, vital signs and time duration between poisoning and hydroxocobalamin treatment are presented in the following table:

b Estimated time

Ten of the 14 subjects survived, including 1 subject who was in cardiac arrest on initial evaluation. Nine subjects were treated with hydroxocobalamin between 0.25 and 5.5 hours after poisoning and survived without sequelae. The last patient who survived with anoxic encephalopathy and memory impairment  was  in  cardiac  arrest  and  received  late  antidote  treatment  as  he  was  treated  with hydroxocobalamin  12 hours  after  his  discovery.  The  4  patients  who  died  had  high  blood  cyanide concentrations (150 to 260 µmol/L) and were all in cardiac or respiratory arrest prior to receiving hydroxocobalamin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  conclusion,  hydroxocobalamin  appeared  to  be  of  interest  in  critically  poisoned  patients  with supralethal blood cyanide concentrations, particularly before the onset of cardiac arrest that lead to anoxic brain damage. Indeed, efficacy of the antidote treatment appeared to be determined by several factors  including  time  between  cyanide  exposure  and  hydroxocobalamin  treatment,  severity  of poisoning  defined  by  blood  cyanide  concentration  and  critical  clinical  events  preceding  antidote therapy,  quantitative  relationship  between  antidote  and  cyanide,  and  adequacy  of  symptomatic treatment. These results underline the necessity for immediate antidote treatment in case of suspicion of cyanide poisoning, preferably at the scene of the incident and without awaiting confirmatory tests.

## · Clinical studies in special populations

No specific clinical studies in special population have been conducted.

Paediatric patients Documentation on efficacy is available for 54 paediatric patients. The mean age of the paediatric patients was about six years and the mean dose of hydroxocobalamin was about 120 mg/kg body weight. The survival rate of 41% depended very much on the clinical situation. Out of the 20 paediatric patients without initial cardiac arrest, 18 (90%) survived, of whom 4 with sequelae. In general, the effectiveness of hydroxocobalamin in paediatric patients was similar to that of adults.

The clinical outcome for the 54 documented paediatric cases is summarised in the table below.

## Table: Outcome of 54 pediatric patients:

|         | Cardiac Arrest   | Cardiac Arrest   | Cardiac Arrest   | Cardiac Arrest   |
|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
|         | Total            | Yes              | No               | Unknown          |
|         | N=54             | N=32             | N=20             | N=2              |
| Outcome |                  |                  |                  |                  |
| Alive   | 22 (41%)         | 3 (9%)           | 18 (90%)         | 1 (50%)          |
| Dead    | 31 (57%)         | 29 (91%)         | 1 (5%)           | 1 (50%)          |

The proposed posology, initial dose of 70 mg/kg which can be repeated without exceeding 10 g, is considered to be adequate and should provide maximum efficacy with acceptable tolerance. This is reflected in the SPC.

## Hepatic and renal impairment

Although the safety and efficacy of hydroxocobalamin have not been studied in these populations, no dosage adjustment is required in these patients. This is reflected in the SPC.

## · Supportive studies

Two supportive retrospective reports in situation of suspected cyanide intoxication due to fire smoke inhalation were provided.

Baud  Study  2  and  Fortin  Study  are  both  retrospective,  uncontrolled,  open-label  studies,  aimed  to describe French clinical experience in hydroxocobalamin treatment for suspected cyanide-poisoning in smoke inhalation victims, at the scene of fires and/or after hospital admission.

Baud Study 2 collected data from files of the Department of Medical and Toxicological Critical Care of 2 Paris hospitals of patients treated with hydroxocobalamin between 1988 and 2004. Fortin Study collected data from medical intervention reports of the Paris Fire Brigade (PFB) for patients treated with hydroxocobalamin between 1995 and 2003.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Although the 2 studies periods overlap and take place in the same city, there was no duplication of patients enrolled in both studies.

## Retrospective study in suspected cyanide intoxication due to fire smoke (Baud Study 2)

## Methods

Baud Study 2 is a retrospective, uncontrolled, open-label study. Data were collected from files of the Department  of  Medical  and  Toxicological  Critical  Care  of  2  French  hospitals  (Fernand  Widal  and Lariboisière Hospitals) of patients treated with hydroxocobalamin between 1988 and 2004. The files included  firemen  reports,  medical  ambulatory  emergency  and  first  aid  unit  reports,  and  hospital records.

Patients  included  were  adults,  suspected  of  acute  cyanide  poisoning  caused  by  smoke  inhalation, received hydroxocobalamin and had available reports from the intensive care units (ICU). Paediatric patients were transported to other hospitals and were not included.

Efficacy  variables  included  survival,  neurological  status  including  Glasgow  Coma  Score  (GCS), hemodynamic status and restoration of spontaneous circulation in patients with initial cardiac arrest. Toxicology parameters (blood cyanide and lactates concentrations) were measured in some subjects. Blood  cyanide  concentrations  were  categorized  as ≥ 40 µ mol/L  (intoxication)  or  &lt; 40 µ mol/L  (no intoxication). Lactates  concentrations  were  categorized  as ≤ 10 mmol/L  (no  poisoning) versus &gt; 10 mmol/L (poisoning).

Due to the retrospective non-comparative design, all results were presented descriptively without any statistical testing.

The main analysis describes the data for the whole study population. Analyses were also performed in subpopulations, according to presence or absence of initial cardiac arrest, and to BCN concentration measured before any antidote treatment.

## Results

A total of 61 smoke inhalation victims (31 women and 30 men), of mean age 54.3 ± 18.3 years (range from 19.7 to 91.9 years), were treated with hydroxocobalamin and had corresponding hospital records between  1988  and  2004.  However,  initial  blood  cyanide  concentrations  were  only  available  for  25 patients, mean value was 45.1 ± 51.3 µmol/L; and 9 of these 25 patients (36.0 %) had blood cyanide concentrations ≥ 40 µmol/L.

Soot deposits were present in 53 patients (86.9%); out of them 36 had soot in their lower airways. Altered neurological status was  reported in 51 patients (83.6%), 34 had an initial loss of consciousness, 35 were in a coma, and 15 were diagnosed as having psycho-organic syndrome. Mean GCS, evaluated in 60 patients, was 9 ± 5. Initial cardiac arrest at the fire  scene  was  reported  in  17 (27.9%) patients. None of the 8 patients who were &gt; 75 years old experienced cardiac arrest at the fire scene. Burns were more prevalent in patients who experienced cardiac arrest (58.8%) compared with patients who did not experience cardiac arrest (29.5%).

The median total dose of hydroxocobalamin administered at the fire scene plus the hospital ICU was 5 g  with  a  range  from  2.5  to  15.0 g.  No  other  antidote,  such  as  thiosulphate,  was  associated  with hydroxocobalamin.  Other  treatments  were:  epinephrine,  administered  to  15  of  the  17  patients  who experienced cardiac arrest; sedation administered to 31 patients (50.8%) were, IV fluids to 48 patients (78.7%),  isobaric  oxygen  therapy  to  60  patients  (98.4%),  hyperbaric  oxygen  therapy  to  43  patients (70.5%), and mechanical ventilation in 43 patients (70.5%).

Thirty-four patients (55.7%) survived and were discharged, and 24 patients died either in the ICU or other hospital departments. For the remaining 3 patients (4.9%), the hospital outcome was missing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Change  in  Neurological  Status  were  not  evaluable  in  most  patients  due  sedation.  Among  the  20 evaluable  patients,  3  patients  shown  improvement,  15  patients  were  stable,  and  2  patients  shown worsening.

Haemodynamic measurements at hospital admission were available in 14 of the 16 patients who were in  cardiac  arrest  and  received  hydroxocobalamin  at  the  fire  scene:  following  treatment  with hydroxocobalamin,  SBP  was  121.1 ± 54.8 mmHg  (range:  36  to  219 mmHg),  DBP  was  69.6 ± 32.8 (range: 19 to 123 mmHg), and heart rate was 96.7 ± 17.0 bpm (range: 70 to 135 bpm).

GCS was 9 ± 5 in 60 patients evaluated at arrival to the fire scene, and 8 ± 5 in 30 patients evaluated at hospital admission.

Regarding toxicology parameters, at hospital admission, mean blood cyanide concentration assessed in 32  patients  was  28.0 ± 38.7 µmol/L  (range:  3.5  to  161.5 µmol/L),  mean  blood  carbon  monoxide concentration  assessed  in  52  patients  at  hospital  admission  was  1.4 ± 1.1 mmol/L  (range:  0.0  to 4.6 mmol/L),  and  mean  blood  lactate  concentration  assessed  in  55  patients  was  8.8 ± 7.6 mmol/L (range: 1.6 to 42.4 mmol/L).

## Retrospective study in suspected cyanide intoxication due to fire smoke (Fortin Study)

## Methods

Contrary to previous studies which were hospital studies, the aim of Fortin Study was to describe Paris Fire Brigade (PFB) clinical experience in treating suspected cyanide-poisoning in smoke inhalation victims at the scene of fires with hydroxocobalamin. This is a retrospective, uncontrolled, open-label study. Data were collected from medical intervention reports of the PFB during their routine practice, and from a copy of the hospital discharge summary when available, for patients treated with hydroxocobalamin between 1995 and 2003. Contrary to previous studies which were hospital studies, this study was performed by the Paris Fire Brigade. Therefore, data after hospitalisation were not always available and can be incomplete.

This study included patients suspected of acute cyanide poisoning due to smoke inhalation and treated with  hydroxocobalamin  by  the  PFB,  with  available  reports  from  PFB.  Patients  were  categorized according  to  their  conditions  when  the  fire-fighters  arrived  at  the  scene  of  the  fire,  as  follows:  (i) Patients  with  cardiac  arrest,  irrespective  of  whether  they  exhibited  other  clinical  signs;  (ii)  Patients without  initial  cardiac  arrest  were  classified  according  to  the  other  main  symptoms  of  cyanide poisoning: shock or hemodynamic instability (SBP ≤ 90 mmHg), neurological impairment (GCS &lt; 15, or loss of consciousness), or no predominant clinical signs.

Efficacy  variables  included  survival,  neurological  status  including  GCS,  hemodynamic  status  and restoration  of  spontaneous  circulation  in  patients  with  initial  cardiac  arrest.  No  blood  samples  were taken for measurement of cyanide levels.

Due to the retrospective non-comparative design, all results were presented descriptively without any statistical testing.

## Results

A  total  of  101  patients  (48  female  and  53  males)  with  smoke  inhalation  were  treated  with hydroxocobalamin by the PFB between 1995 and 2003. Among them, 38 had initial cardiac arrest, 46 altered neurological status and 5 were in shock.

The mean age of patients in the study was 47.1 ± 20.7 years with a range from 2 to 88 years. Most patients were adults; 8 patients were between 2 and 14 years old.

Soot was present in 71.3% of the patients, mostly in the throat. Thirty-six patients had carboxyhemoglobin  (HbCO)  measured  at  ICU  arrival,  and  carbon  monoxide  intoxication  (HbCO

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

≥ 10%)  was  found  in  22  of  those  patients.  Mean  SBP  and  DBP  were  131.0 ± 34.1 mmHg  and 76.4 ± 15.7 mmHg. Overall, the initial mean GCS was 8.0 ± 5.1.

The median dose of hydroxocobalamin administered to the total population  was  5.0  g  (range:  1  to 10 g) and was comparable across subgroups. The median dose recorded in 7 of 8 children was 1.5 g (range:  1.0  to  3.5 g).  No  other  antidote,  such  as  thiosulphate,  was  administered  together  with hydroxocobalamin.

The outcome and reason for death in the total population and in each subpopulation are shown in the table below:

Regarding survival before hospital admission, 84 of the 101 patients survived. The 17 patients who died at the fire scene were in the cardiac arrest subgroup. Hospital outcome was only available for 55 of the 84 hospital patients. Among them, 25 patients (24.8%) died in the ICU and 30 patients (29.7%) survived  and  were  either  discharged  or  transferred  to  another  department.  A  higher  percentage  of patients died in the cardiac arrest subgroup than in other subgroups. Death occurred on average 4 days after  the  event,  within  2-3  days  in  the  'cardiac  arrest'  and  'shock'  subgroups  and  within 9 and 15 days in the 'no predominant sign' and the 'neurological impairment' subgroups.

Baud Study 2 was a hospital study that retrospectively collected data from adult hospital patients and as  a  result  did  not  include  patients  who  died  at  fire  scene,  whereas  Fortin  study  was  a  Paris  Fire Brigade's  study  that  collected  data  from  pre-hospitalization  reports  and  from  hospital  discharge summaries  when  available.  Therefore,  the  lower  percentage  of  survival  observed  in  Fortin  study compared with Baud Study 2 can be explained by difference between populations included in the 2 studies, i.e. before admission to hospital for Fortin Study and after hospital admission for Baud study 2.

Of the 38 patients who had an initial cardiac arrest, 17 patients died on site, and 21 patients had a return of spontaneous circulation before hospitalization. Most of these patients died within 1 to 8 days after  admission  to  the  ICU.  Of  the  21  patients  who  were  admitted  to  the  ICU,  17  patients  died,  2 patients survived, and 2 patients had hospital outcome missing.

Hemodynamic  improvement  was  calculated  for  all  patients  with  0 &lt; SBP ≤ 90 mmHg  prior  to administration  of  hydroxocobalamin,  and  was  defined  as  at  least  1  follow-up  SBP  measure &gt; 90 mmHg.  Of  the  12  hemodynamically  unstable  patients,  9  patients  recovered  normal  blood pressure,  on  average  30.6 minutes  after  start  of  hydroxocobalamin  administration.  The  remaining  3 patients did not recover.

Change in mean GCS was calculated for 52 patients. It was not calculated due to missing final values in 8 patients and due to concomitant administration of sedative drugs in 41 patients. In the 52 patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

who  were  evaluated,  the  mean  GCS  increased  from  7.9 ± 5.4  to  8.5 ± 5.7.  Ten  patients  showed improvement,  41  patients  were  unchanged,  and  1  patient  worsened.  In  the  46 patients  with  initial neurological  impairment,  the  GCS  improved  in  9  of  18  unsedated  patients,  was  unchanged  in  8 patients, and worsened in 1 patient.

- Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

There  was  a  broad  age  range  across  all  studies,  from  2  to  94  years  old.  Fortin  Study  included  8 paediatric subjects aged between 2 and 14 years old, and Baud 3 Study included one almost 15 years old subject. Median age was somewhat younger in Baud Study 3 than in the other studies. Baud Study 3  included  more  men  than  women,  whereas  there  were  approximately  equal  numbers  of  males  and females in the other 3 studies.

It has to be noted that blood sampling has been performed more or less rapidly after cyanide exposure; therefore measured BCN not always indicate actual maximal cyanide concentration. Among measured BCN,  more  severe  cyanide  intoxications  were  reported  in  Baud  Study  3  with  79%  subjects ≥ 100 µ mol/L, and 42 of the 63 (67%) subjects that had BCN measurements in Baud Study 1 were above the toxic threshold of 39 µ mol/L.  Few patients had BCN determined in Baud Study 2, and no one in Fortin Study. Demographic characteristics of subjects with cyanide concentrations above the toxic threshold were generally similar to those of subjects with cyanide concentrations below the toxic threshold.

The median dose of hydroxocobalamin was 5.0 g in the 3 smoke inhalation studies and was 10.0 g in Baud Study 3.  This is consistent with the higher degree of cyanide intoxication in Baud Study 3 than in the other 3 clinical studies.

Overall, despite a slightly greater percentage of males than females included in the studies, a higher percentage  of  females  than  males  had  initial  cardiac  arrest.  The  median  age  of  subjects  with  initial cardiac arrest was generally slightly younger than the median age of the whole population.

Every  subjects  included  in  Baud  Study  1,  had  plasma  lactate  concentrations  measured  at  hospital admission.  As  expected,  subjects  with  initial  cardiac  arrest  had  much  higher  levels  (median: 24.6 mmol/L) than other subjects and subjects with BCN ≥ 39 µ mol/L had higher plasma lactate levels (median: 11.5 mmol/L) than subjects with BCN &lt; 39 µ mol/L (median: 6.1 mmol/L). In Baud Study 2, plasma  lactate  levels  were  available  for  only  15  subjects,  but  as  for  Baud  Study  1,  plasma  lactate concentrations &gt; 10 mmol/L were consistent with initial cardiac arrest and cyanide intoxication.

In  Baud  Study  3,  median  plasma  lactate  concentration  measured  at  the  scene  in  5  subjects  was 17.6 mmol/L.  Thirteen  subjects  had  plasma  lactate  concentrations  measured  upon  arrival  at  the hospital, median was 12.9 mmol/L (range: 2.1-53 mmol/L).

Among the 213 subjects  with  known  survival  outcome,  124  survived  (58%).  Among  subjects  who died, most had initial cardiac arrest. As expected, a higher percentage of subjects (68%) without initial cardiac arrest survived across all studies, compared with subjects with initial cardiac arrest (8%).

Although  cyanide  intoxication  can  result  in  markedly  decreased  blood  pressure,  this  result  was observed  only  in  a  few  subjects  in  the  absence  of  cardiac  arrest.  In  these  subjects,  SBP  generally improved  following  administration  of  hydroxocobalamin.  In  the  Fortin  Study,  5  of  7  subjects  with SBP ≤ 90 mmHg  demonstrated  improvement  to  &gt; 90 mmHg.  In  Baud  Study  3,  2  subjects  without initial cardiac arrest who had SBP ≤ 90 mmHg and who received hydroxocobalamin before admission to hospital, demonstrated cardiovascular improvement upon arrival to the ICU. However, vasopressors  were  frequently  employed,  which  exerted  an  additive  effect  to  hydroxocobalamin  on blood pressure. As no control group was available one cannot attribute the blood pressure increasing effect solely to hydroxocobalamin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  subjects  with  cardiac  arrest  and  in  whom  spontaneous  circulation  was  restored,  a  marked improvement  of  blood  pressure,  often  to  normal  levels,  was  observed  following  administration  of hydroxocobalamin.  It  should  be  noted  that  in  many  instances,  hydroxocobalamin  was  administered concomitantly with other drugs such as vasopressors for hemodynamic improvement.

Cyanide  intoxication  can  result  in  neurologic  signs  and  symptoms  ranging  from  confusion  and disorientation  to  coma.    Neurologic  status  before  and  after  hydroxocobalamin  administration  was therefore  evaluated;  data  presented  in  this  section  represent  subjects  without  initial  cardiac  arrest. Patients who received sedating drugs were excluded from the analysis as disease related effects could not be distinguished from iatrogenic effects.

Neurologic improvement following administration of hydroxocobalamin was most pronounced in the prospective  Baud  Study  1,  in  which  51  of  54  subjects  without  initial  cardiac  arrest  had  initial neurologic  impairment.    Of  these  54  subjects,  38  subjects  (72%)  were  discharged  alive  with  no sequelae.  Neurologic improvement in the retrospective clinical studies was more difficult to assess, since  many  subjects  were  unevaluable  due  to  sedation,  and  since  the  studies  were  not  designed  to specifically and consistently collect that information. Nevertheless, evidence of neurologic improvement was demonstrated in some subjects in the retrospective clinical studies.  For example, 9 of the 10 subjects who survived in Baud Study 3 had no neurologic sequelae at hospital discharge.

In Baud Study 1, 66 of 69 subjects had initial neurological impairment. Among the 47 patients who survived,  complete  resolution  was  achieved  in  38 subjects,  and  neuropsychiatric  sequelae  were observed in 9 subjects. Neuropsychiatric sequelae included psychomotor retardation (n=1), memory impairment  (n=2),  confusion  (n=2),  intellectual  deterioration  (n=1),  dementia  (n=1),  aphasia  (n=1), cerebellar syndrome (n=2), with some patients presenting more than 1 symptom.

In  Baud  Study  2,  20  subjects  were  evaluable  for  neurological  status;  3  subjects  demonstrated improvement, 15 subjects were stable and 2 subjects demonstrated worsening of neurologic status. Of the remaining 41 subjects, 33 were not evaluable due to sedation and data were missing for 8 subjects.

In Fortin Study, 52 of 101 subjects were evaluable for neurological status, 10 subjects demonstrated improvement,  41  subjects  demonstrated  no  change,  and  1  subject  demonstrated  worsening  of neurologic status. Of the remaining 49 subjects, 41 were not evaluable due to sedation and data were missing for 8 subjects.

In Baud Study 3, 9 of 10 subjects survived without neurologic sequelae, and 1 subject was discharged with post-anoxic encephalopathy.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

The efficacy of hydroxocobalamin as a cyanide antidote was studied in 5 studies of which one was a non  clinical,  placebo-controlled  study  performed  in  cyanide-intoxicated  dogs,  and  4  were  non controlled, non comparative French clinical studies either in suspected cyanide-poisoning due to fire smoke inhalation: Baud Study 1 (prospective) and Baud 2 and Fortin Studies (retrospective), or in known cyanide  exposure  from  sources  other  than  fire  smoke:  Baud  Study  3  (retrospective). Furthermore, a pharmacokinetic study has been performed in forty-one healthy volunteers to study the pharmacokinetic profile a 5 and 10 g doses. The main information brought by this study is the linear PK behaviour of hydroxocobalamin over the range of the tested doses (2.5 to 10 g).

The non clinical, placebo-controlled study in 54 cyanide-poisoned dogs was performed to overcome the lack of clinical placebo-controlled study due to ethical reasons. Day 14 survival was significantly greater  in  both  hydroxocobalamin  dose  groups  (75 mg/kg:  79%  and  150 mg/kg:  100%)  compared with placebo (18%). The results also suggested a dose related reduction in neurologic sequelae.

The 5.0 g starting dose (70 mg/kg in children), and the possibility to administer another 5.0 g dose if needed, is supported by clinical experience, by in vitro data, and by the non clinical  study. Indeed, based on dose per body weight and on Cmax of total cobalamins-(III), the 75 and 150 mg/kg doses

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

studied  in  dogs  are  approximately  equivalent  to  respectively  the  5.0  and  10.0 g  doses  in  humans. Based on these considerations, a comparable extent of cyanide detoxification as observed in the dog efficacy study is expected in humans.

The  literature  research  reveals  that  there  are  only  few  published  comparative  data,  and  that  they mostly refer to animal studies. Clinical data mainly refer to case reports.

No comparative study to another antidote, or to oxygen therapy and symptomatic treatments alone in case  of  mild  intoxication,  was  submitted  by  the  applicant.  In  the  situation  of suspected  cyanidepoisoning , according to the EMEA/CPMP guidance document (EMEA/CPMP/1255/03) on the 'use of medicinal products for the treatment of patients exposed to terrorist attacks with chemical agents', hydroxocobalamin  is  the  antidote  of  choice,  in  particular  for  safety  reasons.  Indeed,  dicobalt edentate,  the  other  complexation  agent,  is  more  potent  on  a  molar  basis;  however  it  has  serious cardio-vascular adverse effects in the absence of cyanide. Thiosulphate is both efficient and safe, but acts  with  delay.  And  methaemoglobin-forming  agents  are  potent,  but  associated  with  a  risk  of excessive methaemoglobinemia with impaired tissue delivery of oxygen. Consequently, the lack of a comparator  antidote-group  in  studies  on  victims  of  fire  smoke  inhalation,  for  whom  cyanidepoisoning is mostly suspected rather than known, can be acceptable.

Over the 4 submitted clinical studies , data from 245 subjects were analysed, of whom 72 subjects in cardiac arrest. Most subjects (231/245) were victims of fire smoke inhalation. Suspicion of cyanidepoisoning  in  these  patients  was  based  on  clinical  history  and/or  signs  and  symptoms  of  cyanide intoxication such as presence of soot in the mouth or expectoration and altered neurological status. Given the impossibility  to  rapidly  assay  blood  cyanide  at  the  fire  scene,  cyanide  intoxication  was later  confirmed  at  hospital.  Each  subject  received  oxygenation  that  is  the  basic  treatment  of  such intoxication and, if necessary, symptomatic treatments as mechanical ventilation, and management of seizures,  arrhythmias,  hypotension and metabolic acidosis. The median dose of  hydroxocobalamin was 5.0 g in the 3 smoke inhalation studies and was 10.0 g in Baud Study 3.  This is consistent with the higher degree of cyanide intoxication in Baud Study 3 than in the other 3 clinical studies.

Survival outcome is known for 213 subjects, of whom 124 (58%) survived. Most subjects (63/89) who died  presented  cardiac  arrest  before  treatment.  Initial  cyanide  concentrations  were  only  assessed  in 100 subjects. Among the 34 subjects with BCN above the lethal threshold of 100 µ mol/L, 21 (62%) survived following treatment with hydroxocobalamin. Time between cyanide exposure and treatment was often not controlled, but results suggested a negative link between this time and survival outcome. There  was  a  trend  toward  greater  survival  in  males  than  females,  but  no  conclusion  on  a  potential gender effect can be drawn due to the limited sample size. Subjects younger than 65 years old tend to have  more  non  fatal  outcome  than  older  subjects.  Regarding paediatric  subjects ,  only  9  patients younger  than  19 years  old  were  included  in  the  clinical  studies,  with  poor  survival  related  to  high frequency  of  initial  cardiac  arrest,  but  analysis  of  a  total  of  54  paediatric  cases  revealed  a  similar survival rate to that of adults.

Blood  pressure  generally  improved  following  administration  of  hydroxocobalamin.  However, vasopressors  were  frequently  employed,  which  exerted  an  additive  effect  to  hydroxocobalamin  on blood pressure. As no control group was available, the blood pressure increasing effect cannot be only attributed to hydroxocobalamin.

Cyanide  intoxication  can  result  in neurological  signs and  symptoms  ranging  from  confusion  and disorientation  to  coma.  Neurological  status  before  and  after  hydroxocobalamin  administration  was therefore evaluated. Neurological improvement following administration of hydroxocobalamin was most  pronounced  in  the  prospective  Baud  Study  1,  72%  subjects  were  discharged  alive  with  no sequelae. Neurological improvement in the retrospective clinical studies was more difficult to assess, since  many subjects were unevaluable due to sedation, and since the studies were not designed to specifically and  consistently collect that information. Nevertheless,  evidence  of  neurological improvement was demonstrated in some subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Baseline  plasma  lactate  concentration ≥ 10 mmol/L  appeared  to  be  a  sensitive  marker  of  cyanide intoxication, as the highest lactate concentrations were observed in patients with confirmed cyanide intoxication and in those with initial cardiac arrest.

According to the European guidance document EMEA/CPMP/1255/03,  the simultaneous or successive  administration  of  different  antidotes  has  been  frequently  recommended.  In  the  current dossier,  only  few  data  are  available  on  the  sequential  combination  of  hydroxocobalamin  and  the sulphur supplying agent, sodium thiosulphate, and do not allow to conclude.

## Clinical safety

The safety data from clinical trial populations are issued from 5 studies:

- Study  EML 015722-H101,  a  prospective  study  of  hydroxocobalamin  in  136  healthy  volunteers (including 34 placebo volunteers).
- Baud Study 1, a prospective study that examined the efficacy and safety of hydroxocobalamin in treating  suspected  cyanide  poisoning  in  69  victims  of  smoke  inhalation.    Additional  data  was collected retrospectively to provide a more complete dataset.
- Baud Study 2, a retrospective study that examined the safety and efficacy of hydroxocobalamin in treating suspected cyanide poisoning in 61 victims of smoke inhalation.
- Fortin Study, a retrospective study that examined the efficacy and safety of hydroxocobalamin in treating suspected cyanide poisoning in 101 victims of smoke inhalation.
- Baud Study 3, a retrospective study that examined the efficacy and safety of hydroxocobalamin in treating suspected cyanide poisoning in 14 victims of cyanide poisoning from sources other than fire smoke.

Due to the important differences between the clinical trials (prospective phase I study, prospective with a retrospective collection of data, retrospective data collection), it was considered as not appropriate to pool the data of these studies.

- Patient exposure

Safety data are available for 347  subjects who  have  been  administered  at  least 1 dose  of hydroxocobalamin,  either  as  treatment  for  known  or  suspected  cyanide  poisoning  or  as  part  of  a clinical  trial  to  evaluate  the  safety  of  hydroxocobalamin  in  healthy  volunteers.  In  addition,  clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxocobalamin in the treatment of cyanide poisoning in various settings: smoke inhalation, ingestion, and occupational accidents.

Of these 347 subjects, 245 subjects had suspected exposure to cyanide at the time of hydroxycobalamin  administration.  The  remaining  102  subjects  were  healthy  subjects  who  had  not been exposed to cyanide at the time of hydroxocobalamin administration.

- Adverse events

Study  EML 015722 -H101, conducted  in  healthy  volunteers,  showed  a  well  tolerated  product.  No serious adverse event was reported, no death was reported. The occurrence of allergic reaction in 10 g dose group lead to discontinue the administration of hydroxocobalamin. The main AEs, considered by the Investigator to be possibly study-drug related, comprised the following events:

- -Chromaturia: all subjects in each active dose group experienced chromaturia (red-coloured urine) after  hydroxocobalamin infusion. This event occurred with the first urine sample, was graded as intense and resolved in two or four weeks according to the dose active groups.
- -Erythema (skin redness): A total of 89 (87.3%) of all subjects treated with hydroxocobalamin, i.e., 62 in the 5.0-g dose group and all subjects at the two highest dose levels showed redness of the skin most often graded this event as moderate, but in some cases as intense. Skin reddening in the 5 - 10-g dose groups mainly occurred within 10 to 33 min after start of infusion, i.e. after infusion of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

at least 3g hydroxocobalamin. In most cases the event resolved after approximately 7 days with a total range of 1 to 15 days. This effect can be a potential source of interference on the assessment of burn lesions. This is reflected in the product information.

- -Pustular rash: Pustular rash was reported in 11 (16.7%) of 66 subjects, in the 5 g hydroxocobalamin dose group in 4 of 9 subjects in the 7.5g hydroxocobalamin group and 3 of 18 subjects of 10-g dose groups. The Investigator mainly considered the intensity as mild. The onset of these AEs ranged from 7 to 25 days post-dose and lasted for approximately 6 to 38 days across all dose groups. The pustules were most often located in the face and neck, but also once on the chest and once on the back. This AE was not observed in any of the subjects included in the lowest dose group and in the placebo groups.
- -Headache:  During  the  study,  22  subjects  complained  about  headache  ('headache'  and  'head pressure'), 19 subjects (18.6%) after Hydroxocobalamin infusion and 3 subjects (8.8%) following placebo.  Overall,  an  increase  in  the  number  of  subjects  with  the  AE  'headache'  related  to  the increase in dose was found in the two highest dose groups (55.6% and 33.3% in the 7.5- and 10-g groups versus 22.2% and 9.1% in the 2.5- and 5-g dose groups). Incidences in the 2.5- and 5-g groups appeared to be similar, in particular in view of the differences in sample size. In 9 out of 24 subjects  with  clinically  relevant  increases  in  blood  pressure,  headache  was  observed  starting immediately after start of infusion up to about 24 h after start of infusion. In the two lower dose groups, only 1 subject suffered from headache and increased blood pressure compared to 8 subjects of the higher dose groups. Three of the 9 headaches occurred within about 2.5 hours after start of infusion,  3  within  about  12  hours  and  the  remaining  from  about  16  to  24  hours  after  start  of infusion. Therefore, a direct correlation between the rise in blood pressure and headache seemed to be unlikely.
- -Increased  diastolic  blood  pressure:  besides  redness  and  chromaturia,  increase  in  blood  pressure particularly diastolic blood pressure was reported in 12 patients (18.2%) in the 5 g dose group and in  5  patients  (27.8%)  in  the  10  g  dose  group.  Blood  pressure  (BP)  increases  from  baseline amounting up to maxima of 22.9-27.0 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP), 14.3-25.4 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and 17.1-25.8 mmHg for mean arterial BP The blood pressure started to increase within 2-5 min after start of Hydroxocobalamin infusion, reached a maximum around the end of infusion and returned to near baseline values within 4-8 hours post-dose.
- -Decreased lymphocyte count and increased CRP.
- -Erythema  at  the  injection  site. : At  dose  levels  of  5.0  g,  7.5  g  and  10.0  g  hydroxocobalamin, injection-site  reactions  were  reported  in  14  subjects.  The  symptoms  comprised  oedema,  pain, exanthema (local macula), reddening of the vein or arm at the infusion site. The symptoms redness of infusion vein or arm and local redness at infusion site in the 10-g active group were rated as mild or moderate by the Investigator, started between about 34 and 52 min after begin of infusion and persisted  for  about  2  to  48  hours.  None  of  the  subjects,  who  received  placebo,  reported  any injection site reaction.
- -In addition, 3 cutaneous allergic reactions (rash papular) out of 18 subjects occurred in the 10-g dose group. No such reactions have been observed in Baud 1 study, which could be explained by several factors (decreased identification due to burns or others skin lesions, underreporting in the emergency context, other medications with anti-allergic properties administered in life threatening conditions etc.)

-

Baud Study 1 included  69  patients  (36  females,  33  males).  The  median  age  of  the  patients  was  44 years (range: 20 to 94 years). Fifteen of the 69 patients (22%) were ≥ 65 years of age and among these, 10 were ≥ 75 years of age. A total of 49 patients (71%) received 5g hydroxocobalamin, and 19 patients (27.5%) received 10 g and one patient received 15 g.

A total of 65 of 69 patients (94.2%) experience at least 1 AE. The most common AEs were respiratory disorders  (n=48),  infections  (n=37)  and  metabolic  disorders  (n=35).  These  AEs  are  linked  to  the cyanide intoxication and considered not related to the hydroxocobalamin administration. A total of 19 of the 69 patients (27.5%) experienced at least one AE possibly related to hydroxocobalamin.

Fourteen of the 69 patients (20.3%) experienced complications during the course of hospitalisation, either linked to their past medical history or to the intoxication itself .

A  review  of  cardiovascular  safety  was  added  in  this  study.  Data  collected  concern  the  changes  of blood pressure (BP), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) before and after the first infusion of Hydroxocobalamin.

Systolic Blood Pressure : The initial median SBP on arrival of rescuers determined in 69 patients was 130.0 mmHg (range 0 to 220 mmHg). In patients in initial cardiac arrest, the median was 0.0mmHg while the median initial SBP in patients without initial cardiac arrest was 140.0 mmHg (range 80.0 to 220.0  mmHg). 25% of all patients  had  an  initially  elevated  SBP.  Eleven  of  the  69  patients  had  an elevated  SBP  at  a  level  consistent  with  the  Stage  2  Hypertension  Classification  of  Joint  National Committee(JNC) (S2SBP)VII.

After administration of OHCo including patients with elevated SBP prior to OHCo a total of 27 of 69 patients were noted to have at least one measurement of SBP &gt;160.0 mmHg (S2SBP). As was the case for pre-infusion values, 25% of all patients had an elevated SBP after OHCo infusion between 150.0 and 180.0 mmHg.

Diastolic Blood Pressure: The initial median DBP on arrival of rescuers, determined in 50 patients was 80.0 mmHg (range 0.0 to 110mmHG). In patients with initial cardiac arrest, the median DBP was 0.0 mmHg while the median DBP in patients without cardiac arrest was 80.0 mmHg (range 50.0 to 110.0 mmHg). When one excludes the patients with no BP initially (initial cardiac arrest) the percentage of patients with S2DBP reaches 18. 9 %.

After  administration  of  OHCo,  including  patients  with  elevated  DBP  prior  to  OHCo,  20  of  69  of patients  (29%)  were  noted  to  have  at  least  one  measurement  of  DBP&gt;100.0  mmHg  (S2DBP)  after administration of OHCo. The median difference in DBP after administration of OHCo was 7.5mm Hg

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(range 30.0mmHG to 90.0 mmHg) in the total population. In patients with initial cardiac arrest, the median difference was 10.0 mmHg (0.0 to 9.0 mmHg compared with 5mmHg in patients no initially in cardiac arrest. The median difference in DBP pre- and post- OHCo was 5.0 mmHg in patients less than 65 years of age and 10.0 mmHg in patients more elderly.

The results of this review show there is not a clear dose-effect relationship between elevated systolic blood pressure and the dose of hydroxocobalamin administered.

Heart Rate (HR): The median HR prior to the first infusion of hydroxocobalamin, in patients not in cardiac arrest was: 100.0 bpm (range: 75-140 bpm) in patients not cyanide-poisoned, and 100.0 bpm (range: 59-140 bpm) in patients with initial BCN ≥ 39 µ mol/L. In general there was a slight decline in HR after treatment with hydroxocobalamin.

Baud Study 2 included 61 patients (smoke inhalation victims). A total of 59 patients (96. 7%) received hydroxocobalamin  alone  and  two  received  hydroxocobalamin  plus  sodium  thiosulfate.  36  patients (61%) received a total of 5g of hydroxocobalamin 12 patients 20.3% received a total de 10g,and 6 patients (10.2%) received a total of 15 g. 54 of 61 patients (88.5%) experienced a least 1 AE.  16 of the  61  patients  (26.2%)  experienced  AEs  related  to  hydroxocobalamin:  chromaturia:  there  were  12 reports of dark red urine, skin discoloration: there were 4 reports of red to pink skin, blood disorder s : there  were  2  reports  of  red  colored  plasma,  eyelid  oedema  (n=1),  generalized  erythema  (n=1), hypertension  (n=1).  The  incidence  of  AEs  did  not  appear  to  be  related  to  the  dose  of  administered hydroxocobalamin or to gender.

Fortin  Study included  101  patients  (13  ADR  in  10  patients  were  reported):  Chromaturia  or  skin discoloration:  there  were  5  reports  of  red  or  pink  coloration  of  urine  or  skin,  Allergic  reaction, cutaneous rash (n=1), cardiac arrest (n=2), respiratory distress (n=1), gastric and cutaneous hemorrhages (n=1). These AE have been considered as not drug related.

A  review  of  cardiovascular  safety  was  added  in  this  study:  SBP  and  DBP  measurements  were collected retrospectively for 101 smoke inhalation victims from the medical intervention reports of the PFB during their routine practice. Time points for blood pressures collection included arrival at the scene, T0 (time of hydroxocobalamin administration), T+5, T+10, T+15, T+20, T+25, T+30, T+40, T+50, T+60, T+70 minutes. Data for all patients was not available for all time points. Elevations in SBP and DBP were examined in all patients and in the subgroups listed below. BP thresholds were selected according to the definition of Stage 2 hypertension.

The  mean  SBP  upon  arrival  at  the  scene  of  the  fire  for  patients  not  in  initial  cardiac  arrest  was 131.0±34.1  mmHg  (range  70.0-300.0,  n=61).  After  administration  of  OHCo,  in  25/101  (24.8%) patients there was at least 1 SBP value ≥ 160 mmHg between T0 and T+70 minutes. The peak mean SBP of 144.3±43.5 mmHg (range 80.0-250.0, n=23) was reached at T+30. At T+70, the mean SBP had decreased to 142.9±33.1 mmHg (range 80.0-210.0, n=17).

The  mean  DBP  upon  arrival  at  the  scene  of  the  fire  for  patients  not  in  initial  cardiac  arrest  was 76.4±15.7 mmHg (range 50.0-118.0, n=54). After of administration of OHCo the peak mean DBP of 89.5±22.6  mmHg  (range  60.0-150.0,  n=19)  was  reached  at  T+30.  At  T+70,  the  DBP  mean  had decreased to 87.9±15.7 mmHg (range 67.0-110.0, n=12).

At least 1 isolated elevation in SBP and DBP exceeded the threshold value for Stage 2 hypertension (JNC VII) in 25/101 (24.8%) and in 20/101 (19.8%) of patients respectively, between T0 and T+70.

The  mean  SBP  and  DBP began  to  increase  within  5  minutes  of  the  start  of  OHCo  infusion.  Most patients had a peak mean increase at 20 and return to baseline levels within 70mn. None of the BP elevations have had any harmful consequences. As expected patients with a history of cardiovascular disease or the elderly had higher mean averages for initial, final, and peak BP measures.

Baud study 3 included 14 patients with a diagnosis of cyanide poisoning by ingestion or inhalation. 8 (57%)  of  the  14  patients  experienced  an  ADR.  The  main  drug  related  ADR  are  the  following:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

chromaturia ( dark red urine) (n=5), skin discoloration ( red to pink skin) (n=3), circulatory collapse (n=2) and hypertension (n=1).

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

In the phase I study EML 015722 -H101 no serious adverse events and no deaths were reported.

In studies Baud 1, Baud 2 Baud 3 and Fortin: no serious adverse events and 89 (36%) deaths were reported but none was considered possibly related to administration of hydroxocobalamin.

- Laboratory findings

Interference of hydroxocobalamin with laboratory tests:

Because of its deep red colour, hydroxocobalamin has the potential to interfere with determination of blood chemistry, haematology, coagulation, and urine parameters. Interferences were studied in vitro and in healthy volunteers. Since the pharmacokinetic profile of hydroxocobalamin may be modified in the presence of cyanide, the extent and duration of interference in cyanide-poisoned patients may differ  from  healthy  volunteers.  Data  suggested  that  laboratory  results  may  vary  considerably  from one analyser to another, and depend on hydroxocobalamin concentration and partially on the time between sampling and measurement. Therefore, caution is required when reporting and interpreting laboratory results. This is reflected in the SPC and the labelling (educational sticker for medical and healthcare professionals).

- Safety in special populations

The study protocol of the clinical study EML 015722 was amended in adding blood sample to the study to be used for genotyping experiments. The aim of this additional investigation was to evaluate a possible  correlation  between  genotype  of  the -786 C/T  polymorphism  of  the  human nos-3  gene and cardiovascular  diseases.  From  the  90  blood  samples,  only  53  samples  following  administration  of active treatment were evaluable and a failure of analysis has been observed for about 22%.

Indeed a potential association was reported between C/T nos-3 gene polymorphisms and an increased risk of coronary heart disease. It was demonstrated that patients with a single nucleotide polymorphism at position-786 in the promotor of the nos-3 gene had a decreased capacity to produce nitric oxide (NO) in the endothelium.. Nitric oxide playing a role in regulation vascular tone and in maintenance of properties of vessel wall, the presence of the genotype CC may predispose patients to or accelerate coronary heart disease.

No correlation was found with any of the 3 genotypes, CT, CC, TT for either SBP, DBP, MAP, HR.

## · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No interaction studies have been performed, which is considered acceptable in regards to the indication.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

One subject in clinical study EML 015722 was discontinued in 10 g dose group of hydroxocobalamin due  to allergic reaction. This reaction occurred  12  min  after the start of administration of hydroxocobalamin while the patient had received 3g.

- Post marketing experience

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cyanokit  has  marketing  authorisations  in  France  (1996),  Hong  Kong  (1999)  and  USA  (2006). Cyanokit has been distributed, based on the French marketing authorisation, in 37 other countries (18 EU member states and 19 countries outside Europe).

However, the experience with Cyanokit outside France is very limited. The few data from literature seem to report similar use of hydroxocobalamin outside France as in France, with similar efficacy and tolerance.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

The IV administration of hydroxocobalamin (5.0 or 10.0 g) appears safe and well tolerated, even when administered in the prehospital setting. In general, there was little difference in the incidence of AEs across age categories or between genders. The safety of hydroxocobalamin has been evaluated in study EML 015722-H101, a prospective study in 136 healthy volunteers, and in 4 French clinical studies of subjects with known or suspected cyanide poisoning. A number of ADRs, most of which were transient and non-serious, have been associated with the use of hydroxocobalamin:

Chromaturia and erythema are the primary side effects of treatment with hydroxocobalamin and cannot be avoided. These effects can be a potential source of interference on the assessment of burn lesions (erythema) and of a number of laboratory parameters. This is reflected in the SPC and the labelling (educational sticker for medical and healthcare professionals). However, there are no other known medical consequences of these effects.

-  Chromaturia was detected in most subjects treated with hydroxocobalamin. Chromaturia appeared promptly after administration of hydroxocobalamin and resolved without treatment or sequelae.
- Erythema was detected in most subjects treated with 5.0 g or more of hydroxocobalamin. Erythema appeared during the administration of hydroxocobalamin and resolved without treatment or sequelae.
-  Elevated  blood  pressure  was  detected  in  some  healthy  volunteers  treated  with  2.5  g  or  more  of hydroxocobalamin.  A  return  to  near  pre-dose  mean  blood  pressure  values  was  generally  observed within 4 to 8 hours post-dose.
-  In  some smoke inhalation victims, hydroxocobalamin was associated with reversible and transient increases in blood pressure and, more  rarely, with tachycardia. The  observed  alterations in cardiovascular status rarely, if ever, appear to pose a risk to patients. The risk of these potential side effects must be weighed against the very real lethality induced by exposure to cyanide.
- Allergic reactions have been reported infrequently in healthy volunteers as well as in post-marketing experience. Similar reactions have been reported with chronic use of low-dose hydroxocobalamin in the treatment of Vitamin B12 deficiency.
-  Pustular  or  papular  rash  was  detected  in  a  small  number  of  subjects  treated  with  5  g  or  more  of hydroxocobalamin. The rash was most often located on the face and neck, and resolved spontaneously without treatment.
- The results of haematological, coagulation, chemistry, and urinary analyses may well be altered by hydroxocobalamin. Interpretation of such values should be performed with caution.
-  No  clinically  relevant  ECG  alterations,  respiratory  alterations,  or  blood  gas  alterations  have  been attributed to the use of hydroxocobalamin.

## 6. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the dog efficacy model, Cyanokit significantly improved survival following cyanide administration, and produced a more rapid recovery of cardiovascular and respiratory parameters compared with controls.

Hydroxocobalamin binds coordinatively to plasma proteins and also reacts with cyanide forming cyanocobalamin which is a highly stable complex. In dogs and in humans, both hydroxocobalamin and cyanocobalamin are mainly excreted in the urine.

Hydroxocobalamin has a low acute toxicity. The main target organs of toxicity in repeat-dose studies were the liver, kidney and bone marrow, with findings suggestive of tissue overload with high quantities of hydroxocobalamin. Similar findings were seen in a repeated dose study with cyanocobalamin.

No genotoxic potential have been identified in a standard tests battery. The carcinogenic potential was not studied which is acceptable in view of the toxicological profile and the indication.

Data on the reproductive potential are limited and this is reflected adequately in the SPC. In order to complete the knowledge in this area, embryo-foetal studies (rats and rabbits) will be performed as a post-authorisation commitment (follow-up measure).

No significant risk to the environment is expected.

## Efficacy

Based  on  the  provided  data,  the  efficacy  of  Cyanokit  is  established.  The  efficacy  of  the  antidote treatment appeared to be determined by several factors including time between cyanide exposure and hydroxocobalamin  treatment,  severity  of  poisoning  defined  by  blood  cyanide  concentration  and critical  clinical  events  preceding  antidote  therapy  (mainly  cardiac  arrest),  quantitative  relationship between antidote and cyanide, and adequacy of symptomatic treatment. These results underline the necessity  for  immediate  antidote  treatment  in  case  of  suspected  or  known  cyanide  poisoning, preferably at the scene of the incident and without awaiting confirmatory tests.

Despite  the  lack  of  comparative  study  between  different  cyanide  antidotes,  conclusions  of  the guidance document EMEA/CPMP/1255/03 ' on the Use of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Patients Exposed to Terrorist Attacks with Chemical Agents ' are still valid. Hydroxocobalamin can be considered as the best choice antidote if available, as it is experimentally well documented with clear advantages  in  situations  such  as  fires  with  concomitant  exposure  to  agents  that  reduce  oxygen transport, such as carbon monoxide.

## Safety

The  safety  database  was  collected  from  five  studies:  3  retrospectives  studies,  one  phase  I  study  in healthy  volunteers  and  one  phase  III  prospective  study.  Overall,  this  safety  population  included 347 subjects/patients who received at least 1 dose of hydroxocobalamin.

Based  on  the  provided  data,  the  intravenous  administration  of  hydroxocobalamin  (5.0  or  10.0 g) appears safe and well tolerated, even when administered in the pre-hospital setting. In general, there was little difference in the incidence of AEs across age categories or between genders. The safety of hydroxocobalamin  has  been  evaluated  in  the  phase  I  study  (EML 015722-H101)  in  136 healthy volunteers, and in 4 French clinical studies of subjects with known or suspected cyanide poisoning.

Most of the adverse drug reactions (ADR) were transient and considered as non serious. Chromaturia was observed in most subjects/patients,  as  well  as  erythema  which  may  interfere  with  the  clinical assessment of burns. Both reactions resolved without treatment. Allergic reactions were rare. Other cutaneous reactions such as pustular or papular rash were observed in approximately a third of the healthy  volunteers  of  study  EML 015722-H101  but  not  in  the  Baud  Study  1.  Increases  in  blood pressure were observed in 18.2% of healthy volunteers treated with a 5.0 g dose and 27.8% of those treated with a 10 g dose. More rarely, tachycardia was associated. Increases started 2-5 minutes after start  of  the  infusion,  reached  a  maximum  at  the  end  of  the  infusion  and  returned  to  near  baseline values 4-8 hours post-dose. Similar finding were observed in the Baud Study 2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results of haematological, coagulation, chemistry, and urinary analyses may  be altered by hydroxocobalamin. Interpretation of values of these laboratory parameters should be performed with caution. Lastly, no clinically relevant ECG, respiratory or blood gas alterations have been attributed to the use of hydroxocobalamin.

Overall, despite the small number of patients studied, hydroxocobalamin was well tolerated in subjects in  case  of  non  cyanide  poisoning.  The  intra  venous  administration  was  not  associated  with  a deleterious safety profile. Section 4.8. of the proposed SmPC adequately reflects the safety profile of Cyanokit. Specific warnings and precautions for use are also adequately reflected in section 4.4. of the SmPC.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics

Having considered the safety concerns, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in the risk management plan adequately addressed these

- User consultation

The study was performed according to an acceptable methodology.

The report shows clearly that all respondents were able to answer correctly and without difficulty. Therefore, the test is considered to be satisfactory.

## Risk-benefit assessment

Hydroxocobalamin  is  a  complexation  agent  that  acts  by  direct  binding  of  the  cyanide  ions.  Each hydroxocobalamin molecule can theoretically bind 1 cyanide ion by substituting the hydroxo ligand that  is  linked  to  the  central  trivalent  cobalt  ion.  The  resulting  molecule  cyanocobalamin  is  a  highly stable, nontoxic compound that is excreted in the urine.

In the current dossier, evidence for efficacy is based on 5 studies of hydroxocobalamin as a cyanide antidote:

- -One non clinical  study  placebo-controlled  performed  in  54  cyanide-poisoned  dogs  showed  the beneficial effect of hydroxocobalamin on survival and neurological sequelae compared to placebo in the setting of acute cyanide poisoning.
- -Four non-controlled, non comparative clinical studies either in suspected cyanide-poisoning due to  fire  smoke  inhalation  or  in  known  cyanide  exposure  from  sources  other  than  fire  smoke, provided evidence of hydroxocobalamin efficacy despite the lack of controlled data.

Based  on  provided  data,  hydroxocobalamin  appears  to  be  safe  and  well  tolerated.  Neither  serious adverse event nor death related to the drug was reported, even in healthy volunteers.

In conclusion, hydroxocobalamin, at initial dose of 5 g which can be repeated once if needed, appears to  be  well  tolerated  and  efficient  as  a  cyanide  antidote  on  survival  outcome  and  prevention  of neurological sequelae. As no percentage of success is available with other antidotes or with supportive treatment, no comparative analysis is possible. However, compared to other available antidotes, due to its favourable safety profile even in non-intoxicated subjects, hydroxocobalamin presents advantages in situations were cyanide-intoxication is only suspected, such as fire smoke inhalation.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

-  Routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. Health care professionals will be warned on potential interference of Cyanokit with burn lesions assessment or laboratory tests via a non-promotional educational sticker (part of the product

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- information) that will be included in each Cyanokit pack and that could be attached to the patient's medical record.
-  No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus, that the risk-benefit balance of Cyanokit (hydroxocobalamin) was favourable for the following indication: 'Treatment of known or suspected cyanide poisoning. Cyanokit is to be administered together with appropriate decontamination and supportive measures.' Therefore, the CHMP recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
