<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## I. SUMMARY OF THE DOSSIER

Equilis StrepE is a live vaccine, containing at least 10 9.0 cfu, but not more than 10 9.4 cfu of S. equi strain TW928 per dose as active substance. The vaccine is intended for use in horses from four months of age onwards  to  induce  immunity  against S.  equi to  reduce  clinical  signs  and  occurrence  of  lymph  node abscesses: Strangles. The  vaccination schedule  consists of  a basic  vaccination  with a primary  injection followed by a second injection after an interval of four weeks and a re-vaccination with one dose every three  months to maintain immunity. A priming response is maintained for up to six months after basic vaccination.  Therefore  a  single  dose of vaccine  is  needed  to restore  immunity.  The  vaccine  is administered  submucosally  into  the  inside  of  the  upper  lip,  using  a  volume  of  0.2  ml.  The  vaccine  is presented in a lyophilised form together with the solvent, applicator and a syringe with needle.

## II. OVERVIEW OF PART II OF THE DOSSIER

## Composition

Equilis StrepE is a live vaccine, containing at least 10 9.0 cfu, but not more than 10 9.4 cfu of S. equi strain TW928 per dose as active substance. The vaccine contains a number of stabilisers and is presented with the solvent for reconstitution of the lyophilisate. No adjuvant or preservative is included.

## Container

For both the vaccine and the solvent, vials with a nominal volume of 3 ml and of hydrolytical class type I glass  are  used.  The  vials  are  closed  with  a  halogenobutyl  rubber  stopper  and  encapsulated  with  an aluminium cap.

## Development  Pharmaceutics

The  product  was  developed  in  response  to  the  economic  impact  of  Strangles  and  is  the  first  vaccine against  this  conditionlicensed in the EU. Due to the clonal character of S.  equi ,  development of a live vaccine was favoured. The vaccine strain was isolated as a virulent field strain in The Netherlands. This field isolate was used for construction of a deletion mutant strain, named TW928. A deletion mutant strain has been selected because of environmental safety reasons. The only safety risk that theoretically may be expected is recombination with wild-type S. equi or other homologue species, leading only to the normal wild-type S. equi already present in the field. The suitability of the vaccine strain for all areas of the EU was justified based on the published literature as well as on the results of efficacy studies conducted in different  regions  of  the  European  Union. S.  equi strains  are  genetically  stable  with  respect  to  their immunogenic properties. Further issues regarding the genetic construction of the vaccine strain as well as the question of genetic stability were addressed in the dossier.

Submucosal  vaccination  to  the  inside  of  the  upper  lip  of  horses  was  chosen  as  the  optimal  route  of administration. An applicator is included to ensure that the vaccine is administered at the right depth. For production of the vaccine, routine culture conditions for a live bacterial vaccine are used.

## Clinical trials formulations

Composition  of  batches  used  in  the  clinical  trials  were  provided.  All  the  vaccine  batches  used  in  the clinical trials were produced as described for the vaccine intended for the market, except for fill volume of one batch and the fermentation size for some of the batches.

## Method of manufacture

The method of preparation of the active substance, the freeze-dried vaccine and the solvent was presented in detail. For production, routine culture conditions for a live bacterial vaccine (growth in culture medium, mixing with stabiliser and freeze-drying) are used. All parameters of the process are monitored carefully

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to guarantee a consistent quality. Validation data of the aseptic filling of the vaccine and the lyophilisation process were presented and considered satisfactory.

The minimum and maximum number of subcultures of each seed lot prior to the production stage were specified, along with the typical minimum and maximum bulk sizes.

The solvent is filtered, filled into vials and autoclaved.

## Control of Starting Materials

## Active substance

The wild-type S. equi subspecies equi strain TW was isolated from a lymph node abscess of a horse with Strangles  in  the  Netherlands  in  1990.  This  strain  was  used,  to  construct  the  deletion  mutant S.  equi subspecies equi strain TW928. During construction of the vaccine strain the wild-type gene of strain TW was replaced by the selected gene interrupted by an antibiotic resistance gene, which was subsequently replaced by the gene with the deletion in it, which resulted in the vaccine strain TW928.

Preparation and testing of the Master Seed and Working Seed were adequately described.

Genetic stability  of  the  vaccine  strain  is  very  high  and  was  substantiated  in the  Reversion  to  virulence study. The risk of DNA uptake by the vaccine strain from other bacteria present in its environment is low. Wild-type S.  equi is  classified  as  EEC  class  2  (according  to  EU  Guideline  2000/54/EC)  being  only pathogenic for equidae whereas S. equi strain TW928 considered as non-pathogenic, is classified as EEC class 1. Strangles is not considered as a zoonosis.

## Excipients

Conventional  pharmaceutical  excipients  are  used  and  all  complied  with  the  relevant  Ph.Eur/USP monographs and Certificates of analysis were provided.

Preparation of media were described and information on starting materials used was provided.

The finished product complies with the current TSE-Risk assessment according to Commission Directive 1999/104/EC and Note for Guidance EMEA/410/01-Rev. 1.

## Control tests during Production

Results of in-process control tests for the active substance, freeze-dried vaccine and solvent were provided and met the specifications.

## Control Tests On The Finished Product

The description  of the  methods  used  for the  control  of the  finished  product  (vacuum,  final  inspection, identity, purity, titre, safety, residual humidity) and the specifications were provided. The specifications proposed  at  release  and  at  the  end  of  shelf-life  are  appropriate  to  control  the  quality  of  the  finished product.  As  Equilis  StrepE  is  a  live  vaccine  administered  parenterally,  only  horses  seronegative  with regard to S.  equi and  with  no  history  of Strangles  or  vaccination  against Strangles  will be  used  for the batch safety test. Detailed safety test results will be provided for further batches post-marketing.

Full specifications of the final product tests on the solvent were provided.

The  results  of  the  analysis  of  three  consecutive  production  runs  of  freeze-dried  vaccine  and  for  two consecutive production batches of solvent were presented which comply with the required specifications.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Stability

## Stability of the bulk antigen

The  storage  period  of  the  final  bulk  between  blending  and  filling  at  a  temperature  of  2-10°C  under constant agitation has been validated for a maximum period of 4 days.

## Stability of the finished product

Stability  data  to  support  a  shelf  life  of  36  months  for  the  freeze-dried  vaccine  has  been  provided.  A minimum release  titre  of  10 9.0 cfu  per  dose  of  0.2  ml  is  proposed  on  the  basis  that  efficacy  has  been demonstrated with this dose.

Stability data to support a five year shelf-life for the solvent was provided.

## Stability of the reconstituted product

Stability after reconstitution for two batches reconstituted with solvent and stored at room temperature for up  to  4  hours  was  submitted  and  demonstrate  that  the  vaccine  may  be  used  up  to  four  hours  after reconstitution.

## Environmental  risk  assessment  for  products  containing  or  consisting  of  Genetically modified organisms

Data related to the environmental risk assessment for the product according to Directive 2001/18/EC were provided and consultation with the competent bodies under this Directive was undertaken.

The  choice  and  number  of  gene  deletions  selected  for  the  vaccine  strain  were  justified.  The  genes responsible  for  the  natural  antibiotic  resistance  of  the  vaccine  strain  are  neither  of  chromosomal  or plasmidal origin. A  complete antimicrobial  drug  resistance  profile  of the  vaccine strain including  MIC values  was  provided.  A  detection  limit  of  the S.  equi strain  used  was  determined  by  spiking  of  nasal washings. The results show that S. equi vaccine strain TW928 can be re-isolated from nasal washings if the bacterium constitutes at least 0.028% of the bacterial flora.

The  survival  of  the  vaccine  strain/wild  type  strains  of S.  equi in  the  environment  (tap  water  and  pond water) at different temperatures was investigated.  It was shown that the vaccine strain cannot compete with  other  bacteria  in  its  natural  environment  and  that  the  vaccine  strain  is  only  able  to  survive  in  its natural environment  when the  general  conditions  for bacterial  growth, including the  vaccine strain, are limited.

No particular hazard was identified with the use of this product in the environment. The overall risk to humans, animals and the environment with this product was considered negligible.

## OVERALL CONCLUSION ON PART II

The analytical part of the dossier is well described. Production of the vaccine is straightforward - growth of  the  production  strain,  followed  by  concentration  of  the  harvest,  blending  with  stabiliser,  filling  and freeze-drying.  All  of  the  critical  process  parameters  were  monitored  in  order  to  ensure  a  product  of consistent  quality.  The  TSE  risk  with  this  product  is  negligible.  The  quality  of Equilis  StrepE  can  be considered to be adequately demonstrated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## III. SAFETY ASSESSMENT

The vaccine is intended for use in horses from four months of age onwards to induce immunity against S. equi to reduce clinical signs and occurrence of lymph node abscesses. The vaccine is administered submucosally into  the  inside  of  the  upper  lip,  using  a  volume  of  0.2  ml.  Safety  studies  have  been carried  out  in  the  target  species,  the  horse.  Four  laboratory  studies  and  four  field  trials  have  been conducted.

Composition of batches used in the safety trials and protocols of all batches were provided. All laboratory safety  studies  were  performed  with  a  maximum potency  batch  at  minimum passage level. Field  safety trials were performed with batches of minimum passage level with low to intermediate potency.

Respiratory signs, including pneumonia, were seen in many horses in almost all safety trials, and even in efficacy trials. They were always considered non-specific, essentially because no S. equi could be isolated, contrary to S. zooepidemicus isolated on several occasions. In the safety studies S. zooepidemicus and S. equi were differentiated by colony structure and distinguishable from each other.

## LABORATORY TESTS

One overall study was presented to address the safety of the administration of one dose, an overdose and a repeated  dose  of  vaccine.  An  additional  study  was  performed  to  investigate  the  safety  of  a  ten-fold overdose.  To  fulfil  the  special  requirements  for  live  vaccines  according  to  Directive  2001/82/EC  part 7.C.6, several laboratory studies in the target species have been carried out (spreading and dissemination of the vaccine strain, reversion to virulence).

All  control  animals  used  in  the  studies  had  a  serum  antibody  titre  of ≤ 2 3 cfu/ml  at  the  moment  of challenge and were susceptible to challenge. A definition of specific clinical signs of Strangles used for the assessment of the safety was provided. 'Specific clinical signs of Strangles are swollen lymph nodes and strong pyrexia at the same time'. All laboratory studies were conducted in compliance with the principles of GLP.

## Safety of single, repeated, overdose and spreading and dissemination of live Streptococcus equi strain TW928 deletion mutant vaccine in horses after submucosal vaccination

The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of the live vaccine after submucosal vaccination of foals at an age of three to five months by investigation of local and systemic reactions. The horses were  also  examined  for  shedding  of  the  vaccine  strain,  spreading  of  the  vaccine  strain  to  other susceptible  contact  horses  and  possible  dissemination  in  the  horses  to  different  sites  of  the  upper respiratory tract or draining lymph nodes.

One group of horses was vaccinated three times with one 0.2 ml dose of the vaccine submucosally in the upper lip at intervals of four weeks. Another group was vaccinated with a ten-times overdose of the  vaccine  submucosally  in  the  inside  of  the  upper  lip.  Unvaccinated  horses  served  as  untreated controls.

After  vaccination  with  a  single  dose  of  vaccine,  a  warm  and  diffuse  or  hard  swelling,  which  was painful upon palpation on the day of vaccination, was observed at the injection site from four hours after  vaccination  onwards  and  reached  a  maximum  size  at  day  2  to  4.  After  two  to  three  days  the swellings discharged little exudate and then decreased rapidly in size. Some animals showed a small mucosal  lesion  at  the  injection  site  (day  4  to  10).  All  reactions  disappeared  within  24  days  after vaccination. The reactions caused no apparent discomfort to the horses. The appetite was normal. An increase of rectal temperature up to 2.6°C occured on the day of vaccination. Occurrence of abscesses in the regional lymph nodes after vaccination with a single dose was not observed.

After  vaccination  with  an  overdose,  the  reactions  were  larger  and  more  persistent  than  after  single dose  vaccination.  The  entire  upper  lip  of  all  horses  was  diffusely  swollen,  warm  to  the  touch  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

painful upon palpation. This may be due to the larger volume administered. At four hours after each vaccination there  was  a transient increase in rectal temperature (up to 2.7°C). The temperature  was normal again the next day. In the majority of horses vaccinated with a tenfold overdose, an abscess occurred in one or both of the submandibular lymph nodes, from which  apurulent discharge appeared about one week later. After draining, the abscesses healed completely without any treatment.

Abscesses of the submandibular lymph nodes were seen in the horses on D14 - 24 after vaccination. The SPC was amended to reflect the risk of developing abscesses after an overdose.

## Safety of a ten-times overdose of live Streptococcus equi strain TW928 deletion mutant in horses after submucosal vaccination

The  objective  of  the  study  was  to  confirm  the  results  of  the  ten-fold  overdose.  A  special  batch  of vaccine was prepared, as it is not possible to dissolve 10 vials of the vaccine in 0.2 ml of solvent to obtain the ten-fold overdose. The mean infectivity titre was 10 11.1 cfu/ml, corresponding to 10 10.4 cfu per 0.2 ml dose.

Four month old, susceptible foals were used in this study. The horses were vaccinated submucosally in the inside of the upper lip with 0.2 ml of the test batch, containing 10 10.4 cfu per 0.2 ml dose. All data on local and systemic reactions post vaccination as well as the results at post-mortem were recorded individually for each horse.

All horses developed local reactions after the overdose vaccination. A diffuse and hard swelling was observed  at  the  injection  site  from  four  hours  after  vaccination  onwards.  From  day 3  onwards,  the reactions  drained  a  little  exudate  and  then  decreased  rapidly  in  size  and  subsequently  disappeared within 21 days. At four hours after vaccination the rectal temperature was transiently increased (up to 2.2°C). The temperature was normal again (pre-vaccination level) the next day. After vaccination, all horses  had  a  normal  appetite  and  were  in  good  condition.  Transient  reactive  submandibular  lymph nodes,  i.e.  slightly  enlarged,  were  observed  in  five  horses.  Specific  vaccination-related  signs  were noted in two horses,  which developed an abscess in  one  of the submandibular lymph nodes, 1 to  3 weeks after vaccination. After draining, the abscesses healed completely without any treatment. The possible risk and consequences of the persistence of the vaccine strain in vaccinated horses in view of the possibility that S. equi can establish the carrier state was addressed. It was demonstrated that the vaccine strain does not spread to other horses by the natural route.

## Examination of reproductive performance

The vaccine is not intended to be used in pregnant and lactating animals as stated in the SPC.

## Examination of immunological functions

Simultaneous vaccination of Equilis StrepE with Equilis Pro-T or Equilis Equenza-T had not shown any influence on the immune response against the antigens of these vaccines. Therefore, it is concluded that Equilis StrepE does not adversely affect the immunological response in horses vaccinated with these other two Equilis vaccines.

In the literature, a rare complication after immunisation of highly-immune animals is described, purpura haemorrhagica, which causes severe vasculitis due to immune complex formation. Purpura haemorrhagica has not been observed in any of the safety studies performed during development of Equilis StrepE and this is reflected in the SPC.

## Special requirements for live vaccines

Spreading  and  dissemination  of  live Streptococcus  equi strain  TW928  deletion  mutant  vaccine  in horses after submucosal vaccination was investigated. The horses were examined for shedding of the vaccine  strain,  spreading  of  the  vaccine  strain  to  other  susceptible  contact  horses  and  possible dissemination in the horses to different sites of the upper respiratory tract or draining lymph nodes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After vaccination with a single and repeated dose S. equi was re-isolated from injection site swabs of the majority of horses, mainly at day 3 to 4, but never later than day 4 after each vaccination. From nasal washings, S. equi was not re-isolated. After vaccination with an overdose, S. equi was re-isolated from injection site swabs at day 2 to 7 and from nasal washings at day 2 and day 4. At post mortem examination S.  equi was  not  isolated  from  any  horse  or  tissue  sampledincluding  injection  sites, guttural pouches and lymph nodes.

In 5 overdosed horses, submandibular 'Strangles' abscesses developed, all containing S. equi . In none of the single or repeated dose horses or controls, were abscesses seen to develop and isolation of S. equi could  not  be  made,  except  at  the  injection  site  D1-D4.  In  overdosed  horses  there  was dissemination  of the  organism to the submandibular lymph nodes. The single  dose and repeat  dose horses developed a small suppurative inflammation locally at the injection site, whereas the in-contact horses  had  no  signs  of S.  equi dissemination.  It  is  reflected  in  the  SPC,  that  the S.  equi vaccine establishes a small suppurative inflammation locally at the injection site, and potentially disseminates to  the  regional  lymph  nodes.  The  transmission  of  the vaccine  strain  from  overdosed  horses  with  a draining abscess has not been investigated.

Carriers  of  the  vaccine  strain  can  be  detected  after  three  consecutive  nasopharyngeal  swabs  with  60% success after bacteriological isolation and with 90% success with PCR-methods. The PCR method detects both  viable  and  non-viable  bacteria,  but  also  fragments  of  DNA  of  bacteria  which  drained  from  the injection  site.  As  for  spreading  and  dissemination  studies  only  viable  bacteria  should  be  detected  and standard bacteriological examination methods were applied.

## Reversion to virulence

Reversion to virulence was tested in two separate studies. In the first study, five passages through horses were  made  in  total.  In  the  second  study  the  sixth  passage  in  horses  was  performed  and  the  safety  of material from the sixth passage was compared with that of unpassaged material.

The reversion to virulence study was performed in accordance with the guidelines where the safety of material  from  the  highest  successful  passage  is  compared  with  that  of  unpassaged  material.  The identity  of  the  original  vaccine  strain  and  the  vaccine  strain  after  the  last  passage  in  horses  was confirmed by PCR i.e. presence of the deletion. The choice of the intranasal challenge model used for testing of reversion to virulence was justified.

The study  to  perform an  additional  (sixth)  passage  in  horses  and  to  compare  the safety  of  material from this passage with the safety of unpassaged material showed that the vaccine does not revert to virulence after six in vivo passages. Two weeks after intranasal inoculation the vaccine strain could not be  isolated  from  injection  site  swabs/samples  of  the  inner  side  of  the  upper  lip  and  nasal  washing samples.

One  year  old  horses  were  used  in  this  study,  as  when  the  experiment  started  no  animals  of  the specified  age  were  available.  Neither  the  Ph.Eur.  5.2.6  nor  the  Directive  2001/82/EC  state  that reversion to virulence should be tested in animals of the minimum age.

## Biological properties of the vaccine strain

Information on the biological properties of the vaccine strain and its suitability for use in a live vaccine was  provided.  The  vaccine  strain is  a  deletion  mutant  which  is  unable  to  multiply  in  humans  or  other animals.

## Recombination or genomic reassortment of strains

The  strain  was  shown  to  be  genetically  stable.  The  possibility  of  recombination  or  genomic reassortment of the vaccine strain with wild-type organisms was shown to be remote. S. equi can be considered a clonal pathogen, based on its uniform antigenicity, identical restriction fragments profiles and  data  from  multilocus  enzyme  electrophoresis,  indicating  no  or  very  limited  horizontal  gene transfer or influx of heterologous DNA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Interactions

Some information regarding the compatibility of Equilis Pro, Equilis Pro-T, Equilis Equenza and Equilis Equenza-T has been provided. However, while there appears to be no influence on the immune response to these vaccines when Equilis StrepE is administered and in light of the limited efficacy data provided to support the concurrent claim, it is not possible to include a recommendation of concurrent vaccination.

## FIELD STUDIES

Four field safety studies have been carried out. The trials were performed according to the principles of the guideline 'Good clinical practice for the conduct of clinical trials for veterinary clinical products'.

## A field safety trial of Equilis StrepE in horses

The aim of this study was to assess the safety of Equilis StrepE under field conditions. Horses of at least 4 months of age were included in the study. Horses were vaccinated submucosally (0.2ml) into the inside of the upper lip, whereas control horses were injected with the solvent only. The horses received the first two injections at an interval of four weeks and a third injection three months after the second vaccination. The first and second vaccination were given to investigate all aspects of field safety. The third vaccination, however, was given to investigate whether the local reactions would increase after repeated vaccination.

One hour after first vaccination, no significant differences were observed between the vaccinated and the solvent  group. Four  hours after  vaccination significantly  more horses  of the  vaccinated  group showed a local reaction compared to the solvent group. Vaccination with Equilis StrepE, resulted in a typical local reaction at the injection site, normally starting as a diffuse soft swelling. Most of the reactions were small to  medium  in  size  (&lt;2  x  2cm  -  &lt;4  x  4cm),  hard  in  nature  and  sometimes  painful  upon  palpation.  The maximum size  was normally  reached  2  to  3  days post  vaccination .  From  day  4  onwards,  the  reactions decreased in size, became  softer in  nature and sometimes led to  an  erosion  of tissue  accompanied by  a discharge. The mean duration of local reactions was about seven days. On day 14, most of the reactions had disappeared.

One and four  hours after second  vaccination, significantly  more  horses of the  vaccinated  group showed local reactions compared to the solvent group. After the second vaccination, all swellings observed were visible from the outside of the lip. Two-thirds of the horses showed an extensive swelling with a maximum (2x2 cm to 4x4 cm, hard in nature) at day 2 and 3. This was comparable to what has been described after first vaccination.

One hour after third vaccination, no significant differences were observed between the vaccinated horses and  those  administered  the  solvent.  Four  hours  after  vaccination,  significantly  more  horses  of  the vaccinated group showed a local reaction and more than half of the horses showed a large (greater than 4x4 cm) or a medium (2x2 to 4x4 cm) swelling. This is similar to that described after first vaccination. A slight and  transient  increase  inrectal  temperature  after  vaccination  was  observed  as  well.  The  average  rectal temperature  was  38.0 ± 0.2°C  for  the  vaccination  group and  37.8 ± 0.2  °C  for  the  group  administered  the solvent.

On  day  one  after  first  and  second  vaccination  with  Equilis  StrepE,  swellings  of  the  mandibular  or retropharyngeal lymph nodes were observed in the majority of vaccinated horses. Swelling of the lymph nodes  had  declined  at  the  next  examination  time  point  at  day  4  and  reached  base  levels  at  day  14. Approximately half of the swollen lymph nodes were painful on palpation at day one after vaccination. In the group administered the solvent, lymph node swellings were also noted, but to a lesser extent and were not painful on palpation.

The SPC includes a warning that swellings at the injection site which may be 'warm or painful' develop with 4 hours, and that the reaction is maximal 2-3 days post vaccination. The swelling resolves completely with 3 weeks and causes no apparent discomfort. The SPC also states 'Slight enlargements, which may be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

transiently painful, of the retropharyngeal and mandibular lymph nodes may occur for a few days after vaccination. Further, an increase in rectal temperature up to 2°C may occur on the day of vaccination'.

## A field safety trial of Equilis StrepE administered concurrently with Equilis Equenza-T

The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  the  safety  of  vaccination  with  Equilis  StrepE  under  field conditions, when administered concurrently with Equilis Equenza-T. The Equilis Equenza-T vaccine batch used contained 100 AU subunits A/equine 1/Prague/56, 50 AU subunits of A/equine 2/Newmarket 1/93, 50 AU subunits of A/eqine 2/Newmarket 2/93, 40 Lf of purified tetanus toxoid and 125 µg saponin per dose of 1 ml.

Foals between 6 and 8 months of age were included in the study. The horses were divided into four groups.

- Group A:   Horses, vaccinated with Equilis  StrepE (0.2 ml) submucosally in the upper lip, concurrently with Equilis Equenza-T intramuscularly in the pectoral muscle at days 0 and 28.
- Group B: Horses, vaccinated with Equilis StrepE (0.2 ml) submucosally in the upper lip at days 0 and 28.
- Group C:   Horses, vaccinated with Equilis Equenza-T intramuscularly in the pectoral muscle at days 0 and 28.
- Group D: Horses, non-vaccinated controls

All animals vaccinated with Equilis StrepE showed a local reaction at the injection site. Initially the reaction had a diffuse character. Later on the swelling changed to a hard nodule. Within a few days, the reaction discharged and then disappeared. A slight and transient increase of rectal temperature was observed.

The results show that concurrent use of Equilis StrepE and Equilis Equenza-T is safe. However, the recommendation  to  use  such  a  combination  has  not  been  included  on  the  SPC  due  to  the  limited efficacy data provided.

## A field safety trial of Equilis StrepE in pregnant horses

The aim of this study was to assess the safety of vaccination with Equilis StrepE under field conditions in pregnant horses. One group of horses was vaccinated submucosally (0.2 ml) into the inside of the upper lip, whereas another group of horses was injected with the solvent only. Depending on the stage of the pregnancy, the  mares received two to five injections. The horses received the first two injections at an interval of four weeks and the following injections at intervals of three months. Vaccinations were given in all stages of pregnancy. The mares were vaccinated from the day after mating up until two days before parturition.

One  horse  of  the  Equilis  StrepE  group  gave  birth  twice  during  the  study  period.  None  of  the  mares aborted. Nearly all pregnancies had a normal course. Only one pregnancy  in the vaccinated group had a negative outcome. A fully developed foal was stillborn together with the placenta.

This study was provided for information only, as the vaccine is not intended for use in pregnant and lactating  horses.  Nevertheless, the results  confirm the observations  made in the  other safety studies included in the documentation.

## ECOTOXICITY

A study was conducted to test survival of the S. equi strain TW928 in different environments at ambient temperature. In  0.9%  salt  solution  at  ambient  temperature,  the  vaccine  strain  was  inactivated  within  a period  of  three  weeks.  After  air  drying  of  4.0x10 9 cfu/ml,  no  growth  of  the  vaccine  strain  could  be detected at five and six weeks after drying.

The study was performed again, but now also at +2 to +8 °C and +37 °C. In tap or pond water the vaccine strain appeared quickly inactivated and /or overgrown by other bacteria that were already present in these

waters. At higher temperatures the inactivation and overgrowing of the vaccine strain occur faster than at lower temperatures. Survivability was best in air-dried conditions at low temperatures.

## Phase 1 Assessment

An assessment  of  risk  according  to  EMEA/CVMP/074/95  was  conducted.  A  Phase  I  ecotoxicity  risk assessment  was  performed,  and  was  deemed  to  have  been  adequately  addressed.  No  Phase  II  risk assessment was considered necessary and was therefore not performed, in line with current guidelines.

## IV. OVERVIEW OF EFFICACY TRIALS

## INTRODUCTION

Efficacy studies (four laboratory studies and one field trial) have been carried out in the target species, the horse,  by  the  recommended  route  of  administration.  The  approved  indication  is  'For  immunisation  of horses against Streptococcus equi to reduce clinical signs and occurrence of lymph node abscesses.'

The following studies were performed:dose-response study; studies assessing duration of immunity and onset of immunity after basic vaccination and re-vaccination; compatibility studies; one field trial.

For laboratory efficacy studies batches of vaccine at maximum passage level (except onset of protection study:  minimum  passage level)  with  minimum or sub-minimum  potency  were  used. The  field  efficacy study was performed with a medium potency batch at minimum passage level.

## IV.C. LABORATORY TRIALS

For all efficacy studies the same numeric clinical scoring system has been used and the most important parameters used to assess the efficacy of the vaccine are temperature and lymph node palpation, which are specific  for  Strangles.  Other  symptoms  e.g.  throat  swelling,  stridor,  anorexia  and  lameness  (only  in bastard Strangles) are only observed in very severe cases.

In all studies the rectal temperature was measured daily after challenge, but the clinical examination was performed at regular intervals during 0-4 days. Since the clinical signs in vaccinates and controls were evaluated in the same manner, advantages or disadvantages of assessing certain parameters on a limited number of days were the same for both groups.  The criteria for allocation of horses to the different groups for  the  efficacy  studies  were  equivalent  to  that  for  the  safety  studies;  the  horses  were  allotted  to  the different groups based on an even distribution based on age and supplier.

Although a variety of statistical tests were used to assess data resulting from studies to evaluate the efficacy of Equilis StrepE, there was little statistical planning of the experiments reported in the initial submission.  Due  to  the  lack  of  pre-planning  the  studies  may  have  been  underpowered  in  order  to detect biologically relevant differences between the vaccinated and the control groups. However, it is acknowledged that with respect to animal welfare the number of animals used in such trials should be minimised.

The data presented were re-analysed by repeated measures ANOVA using the generalised linear model in Minitab  and,  where  appropriate,  a  Dunnet's  comparison  with  the  control  group.  This  type  of  analysis compares the data measured on the different days and also takes into account that the data on the different days were measured in the same animals. However, after rechecking the analysis performed, it was noted that the model used, did not account for the correlation of repeated measurements within the same animal. Therefore,  a  re-analysis  of  the  data  using  the  correct  statistical  model  was  provided  and  found  to  be acceptable.

Another point of concern with the statistical analysis as performed was the fact that only p-values were reported. Estimates of the effects seen including their pertinent confidence intervals (necessary to judge the relevance of observed statistical significances) in general were lacking.

The  total  clinical  score  used  to  assess  the  effects  of  vaccination  was  based  on  all  clinical  parameters measured  including  rectal  temperature.  The  data  was  re-analysed  focussing  on  the  typical  clinical parameters for Strangles: pyrexia (rectal temperature) and nasal discharge/lymphadenopathy.

Vaccination  with  Equilis  StrepE  results  in  decreases  in  rectal  temperature:  mean  decreases  in  rectal temperature are observed of up to almost 1 o C for an 11 day period with peak decreases of up to 2.68 o C.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Vaccination resulted in clinically significant decreases in mean clinical score for nasal discharge/lymphadenopathy.

The  'Split-Plot'-model  used  in  the  re-analysis  of  the  data  on  temperature  and  nasal  discharge  and lymphadenopathy is appropriate.

Based on animal welfare reasons and the observation that the control animals consistently developed Strangles upon challenge, the number of control animals included in the experiments were limited and were considered to function as a check of the uptake of the challenge. A re-analysis of the cumulative abscess  score  data  using  the  individual  control  groups  and  also  the  data  of  the  combined  control groups  was  provided.  It  can  be  concluded  that  vaccination  with  Equilis  StrepE  gives  a  significant reduction  in the cumulative abscess scores.

Some  concerns  were  raised  regarding  the  pooling  of  controls.  It  was  confirmed  that  pooling  of  the control groups was only performed for the analysis of the po st-mortem data of the vaccination/challenge  experiments  and  not  for  the  analysis  of  the  rectal  temperature  data  or  nasal discharge/lymphadenopathy data. For the latter two parameters, comparisons were only made with the corresponding control groups. For the analysis of the field trial no pooling of data of control groups was performed.

For each of the trials a large number of tests were performed without adjustment. A p-value adjustment should have been made when using multiple control groups. It is clear, that when the adjusted p-value is used  in  three  experiments  a  significant  difference  in  cumulative  abscesses  score  is  observed  between vaccinated group and the pooled control group.

The  three  major  parameters  analysed  to  demonstrate  the  efficacy  of  Equilis  StrepE  were:  rectal temperature; nasal discharge and lymphadenopathy; post-mortem analysis of the lymph nodes (abscess score). The rectal temperatures in vaccinated and control animals were determined on a large number of different days. The data were re-analysed by repeated measures ANOVA which compares the data of the vaccinated and control animals measured on the different days and also takes into account that the data measured on the different days are measured in the same animals. Therefore, multiplicity is not  an  issue  for  this  parameter.  The  nasal  discharge/lymphadenopathy  data  was  re-analysed  in  the same  manner  as  the  rectal  temperature  data  and  therefore  multiplicity  is  also  not  an  issue  for  this parameter. The post-mortem score (abscess score) is determined at only one time point. Multiplicity is therefore not an issue for this parameter. It was noted however that not only multiple measurements over time but also multiple endpoints (as in this study) form sources for multiplicity.

## Establishment of a Challenge Model

For  demonstration  of  efficacy  an  intranasal  challenge  model  in  horses  was  used.  The  criteria  used  to diagnose Strangles were defined as 'Specific clinical signs of Strangles are swollen lymph nodes caused by S. equi and strong pyrexia at the same time'. Clinical examination was performed double blinded i.e. the  veterinarian  was  unaware to which group, vaccinates or controls, the animal belonged. The overall condition of the individual animal at the moment of veterinary examination is decisive for determining the time point for euthanasing diseased animals.

The challenge strain was obtained from a horse with clinical Strangles and was identified as Streptococcus equi subspecies equi and  was  haemolytic  on  blood  agar  plates.  The  doses  were  based  on  preliminary studies  in  which  Strangles  was  induced  in  unvaccinated  horses.  As  all  challenged  control  horses developed clinical signs, the choice of the challenge strain and method  is  justified. Intranasal administration of a fresh culture of the S. equi challenge strain containing about 10 9 cfu/ml consistently resulted in signs of Strangles within five to ten days in control animals. The serum antibody ELISA was used to verify the susceptibility of the horses to S. equi infections. No correlation between protection and antibody titre was shown.

## Determination of the Vaccine Dose

## Dose-response study in horses with Equilis StrepE administered submucosally in the lip

The objective of the study was to determine the vaccine dose of Equilis StrepE vaccine after submucosal vaccination of horses at an age of 4 to 5 months with no history of Strangles (dose-response experiment).

Horses  were  vaccinated  twice  with  10 9 cfu/0.2  ml,  with  10 8 cfu/0.2  ml  or  with  10 7 cfu/0.2  ml  at intervals  of  four  weeks  submucosally  in  the  upper  lip.  Other  horses  were  used  as  unvaccinated challenge controls. All horses were challenged intranasally two weeks after second vaccination.

A repeated  dose  of 10 8 or  10 9 cfu  per  dose  induced  a  comparable  protection  in  vaccinated  horses.  No difference in protection was shown between a repeated dose of 10 8 or 10 9 cfu per dose at two weeks after vaccination. The minimum protective dose was set at 10 9 cfu per dose. A dose of 10 8 cfu seemed to be the absolute  minimum protective  dose, but it  was  assumed that 10 9 cfu  would  induce  a  better  duration  of immunity.

## Onset of protection

## Efficacy of Equilis StrepE vaccine in foals vaccinated concomitantly with Nobi Equenza-T

The objective of the study was to investigate the onset of immunity after submucosal re-vaccination with one  dose  of  Equilis  StrepE  at  six  months,  after  completion  of  the  basic  immunisation  in  horses. Additionally,  the  horses  were  simultaneously  vaccinated  intramuscularly  with  Nobi  Equenza-T  to  test compatibility.

The Equilis StrepE vaccine batch used (at a passage level of X+6 from the MS) contained 1 x 10 9 cfu per dose. The Nobi Equenza-T vaccine batch used contained 100 µg subunits A/equine 1/Prague, 50 µg subunits  of  A/equine/Miami/63,  50  µg  subunits  of  A/eqine/Fontaine-bleau/79,  40  Lf  of  purified tetanus toxoid and 125 µg Quil A per dose of 1 ml.

Six month old foals havingno history of Strangles, influenza and tetanus (disease or vaccination) were used in this study. The first group were vaccinated with Equilis StrepE (10 9 cfu/0.2 ml) submucosally in the upper lip and with Nobi Equenza-T (1 ml) intramuscularly. At day of first treatment all horses were seronegative or had very low titres to S. equi . After the second and third vaccination most of the horses showed a seroconversion. Seroconversion was also observed in the group only vaccinated with Nobi Equenza-T.

The horses were challenged  with virulent S.  equi two  weeks after the last vaccination. The  controls developed  clear  signs  of  Strangles,  whereas  no  clinical  signs  of  Strangles  were  observed  in  the vaccinated horses. A post-mortem investigation confirmed the clinical findings.

As limited efficacy documentation was presented for the combined vaccination any conclusions regarding any  effect  of  vaccination  with  Equilis  StrepE  on  influenza  or  tetanus  antibody  titres  development  are impossible. The revaccination 6 months after the second vaccination at D210, shows that the anamnestic response is present and protection is restored after one booster vaccination. A single dose after 6 months will restore immunity.

## The Influence of Maternal Antibody on the Efficacy of the Vaccine

It  was  confirmed  that  maternal  antibodies  to S.  equi do  not  have  an  influence  on  the  efficacy  of  the vaccine. The minimum age of vaccination is 4 months and if maternal antibodies to S. equi are present, they should be declining or have disappeared at that time. This was confirmed by the serology results of the safety and efficacy studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Duration of Immunity

## Duration of immunity of S. equi vaccine and compatibility with Equilis Equenza-T

The objective of the study was to investigate the duration of immunity after submucosal vaccination with Equilis  StrepE  in  horses  at  an  age  of  4  to  5  months. Additionally  the  horses  were  simultaneously vaccinated intramuscularly with Equilis Equenza-T to test compatibility.

The Equilis StrepE vaccine batch (at maximum passage level) used contained 1 x 10 10 cfu per vial. The Equilis  Equenza  T  vaccine  batch  used  contained  100  AU  subunits  A/equine  1/Prague,  50  AU subunits of A/equine 2/Newmarket 1, 50 AU subunits of A/eqine 2/Newmarket 2, 40 Lf of purified tetanus toxoid and 125 µg saponin per dose of 1 ml.

Four to five month old foals having no history of Strangles were used in this study. The horses were divided into two  groups;  vaccinated  with Equilis StrepE 0.2 ml) submucosally in the  upper lip and with Equilis Equenza-T (1 ml) intramuscularly in the neck muscle or; vaccinated with Equilis Equenza T  (1  ml)  intramuscularly  in  the  neck  muscle.  The  horses  were  vaccinated  twice  at  four  weekly intervals.  Several  horses  received  a  third  vaccination  6  months  after  the  second.  At  day  of  first treatment all horses  were seronegative  or  had  very low titres to S.  equi .  After  the  second  and  third vaccination, most  of the  horses showed a seroconversion. Challenge  was performed  3  months after second vaccination as well as 3 and 6 months after third vaccination.

The  duration  of  immunity  after  two  or  three  submucosal  vaccinations  with  Equilis  StrepE was examined in horses, at the youngest recommended age of vaccination. The horses were simultaneously vaccinated  with  Equilis  Equenza-T,  an  influenza  and  tetanus  vaccine,  to  test  compatibility.  The immunity against S. equi was tested by challenge and the efficacy of Equilis Equenza-T was evaluated serologically.

Efficacy is limited to 3 months after two injections and no protection is seen after 6 months. Therefore, revaccination every 3 months is required to maintain immunity.

Additionally a new study had been performed in which a group of horses received a basic vaccination of Equilis  StrepE  and  a  single  booster  vaccination  6  months  later  (group  1).  At  the  moment  of  booster vaccination  horses  suffering  from  Strangles  were  introduced  into  the  herd.    Another  group  of  horses (group  2)  received  their  first  vaccination  at  the  moment  that  the  horses  suffering  from  Strangles  were introduced  into  the  herd  and  the  last  group  of  horses  (group  3)  served  as  unvaccinated  controls.  The objective of the study is to investigate the efficacy of Equilis StrepE in horses when vaccinated during an outbreak.

Significant  differences  were  observed between  group  1 and  group 3 regarding  clinical  examination. The results demonstrate that most of the horses were protected against a field infection with S. equi about 25 weeks after a previous basic vaccination if the third vaccination and infection occurred at the same time. It was demonstrated that a single injection of Equilis StrepE after a time span of 6 months is sufficient to restore immunity at a level of protection at least equivalent to the level obtained after basic vaccination.The SPC (section 5.5) includes a sentence e.g. 'Basic vaccination performed during an  outbreak  is  not  efficacious  because  immunity  is  insufficient  until  basic  vaccination  has  been completed.' Section 5.8 of the SPC included the statement: 'A priming response is maintained for up to  six  months  after  basic  vaccination.  Therefore  only  a  single  dose  of  vaccine  is  needed  to  restore immunity.'

## FIELD TRIALS

## Field efficacy of Equilis StrepE including compatibility with Equilis Pro-T

The objective of the study was to investigate the efficacy of Equilis StrepE in young horses under field conditions, against field exposure. Additionally the horses were simultaneously vaccinated intramuscularly  with  Equilis  Pro-T  (contains  three  inactivated  influenza  antigens  and  tetanus)  to  test compatibility.

The Equilis StrepE vaccine batch used contained 1 x 10 9.1 cfu per dose. Six to seven month old horses, with no history of Strangles, disease or vaccination were used in this study. The horses were divided into two groups; vaccinated with the Equilis StrepE submucosally in the upper lip and with Equilis Pro T (1 ml) intramuscularly; or vaccinated with Equilis Pro T only, (1 ml) intramuscularly. The horses were vaccinated at days 0 and 28 of the study with both vaccines.

The following parameters were significantly different between vaccinated horses and control animals (p&lt;0.05):

- ♦ mean daily clinical scores
- ♦ total clinical scores
- ♦ number of horses with clinical signs of Strangles
- ♦ number of lymph nodes affected
- ♦ mean cumulative abscess score

A group, vaccinated only with Equilis StrepE, wasnot included. The Committee agreed that if horses are vaccinated with Equilis StrepE alone, the number of animals without any clinical or subclinical signs of Strangles would be greater. No recommendation for concurrent use is included in the SPC.

## OVERALL CONCLUSION ON PART IV

From the results of the efficacy studies performed, it may be concluded that Equilis StrepE is efficacious at 10 9.0 cfu of S. equi strain TW928 per dose and that reduction in clinical signs of Strangles and reduction of lymph node abscesses is obtained as early as 2 weeks after completion of the basic vaccination. The duration of immunity of Equilis StrepE is three months after completion of the basic vaccination and after each single booster vaccination.

Vaccination  with  Equilis  StrepE  seems  to  have  a  beneficial  effect  at  10 9.0 cfu  per  dose  leading  to  a reduction in specific clinical signs of Strangles (strong pyrexia and swollen lymph nodes). A justification for  10 9 cfu chosen  as  minimum  protective  dose  of  vaccination  was  provided,  as  the  repeated administration  of  10 8 or  10 9 cfu  per  dose  seemed  to  induce  a  similar  protection  in  vaccinated  horses. Statistical  analysis of these data was presented. There is no difference in protection between a repeated dose of 10 8 or 10 9 cfu per dose at two weeks after vaccination.

## RISK-BENEFIT ASSESSMENT

Strangles is a highly contagious disease of horses caused by the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus equi subspecies equi, a beta-haemolytic, Lancefield group C streptococcus. A high fever will normally be present, as well as coughing and difficulty in swallowing. A nasal discharge appears which begins as a clear, thick  discharge  but rapidly  becomes  yellow and contains a large amount of pus. External lymph nodes behind the back edge of the mandible, under the lower jaw, and above the eye begin to swell and become  very  painful.  Internal  lymph  nodes  in  the  head  regioncan  become  large  enough  to  block  the airway, causing the horse to have difficulty breathing and hence the name Strangles. The lymph nodes may rupture, and dischargehighly infectious pus for 7-14 days after the onset of clinical signs.

Other horses may develop 'bastard Strangles'. This is a more rare, but more severe form of the disease, with an almost 100% mortality rate, that involves abscessation of internal lymph nodes, including brain, mesenteric and pulmonary lymph nodes and possible rupture of them within the body.

Strangles  cannot  be  effectively  treated  with  antibiotics  as  the  latter  fail  to  penetrate  abscesses  and  the presence of pus inactivates most antibiotics. Strangles outbreaks are protracted and the fatality rate may reach 10%. There is currently no other vaccine licensed for Strangles in the EU. Strangles is one of the most  frequently  diagnosed  infectious  diseases  of  the  horse.  No  eradication  programmes  exist  on  a European or national level against Strangles.

The main benefit for horses is that Equilis StrepE reduces the clinical signs and occurrence of lymph node abscesses  after Streptococcus  equi infection. The  vaccine  has  to  be  regarded  as  an  \"orphan  product\" which will be administered only in horses for which a risk of Streptococcus equi infection has been clearly identified, due to contact with horses from areas where this pathogen is known to be present.

## The analytical part of the dossier is well described.

The results of the safety trials demonstrate that Equilis StrepE is safe for horses from four months of age onwards, as the local and systemic reactions observed after single, repeated dose and overdose treatment were considered acceptable and healed completely without intervention and without residues. Furthermore,  the  vaccine  strain  did  not  spread  to  other  target  animals  and  did  not  revert  to  virulence following six passages in- vivo . Any risk for the operator or environment is not to be expected.

The Committee agrees, that due to the genetic nature of the vaccine strain and its clonal character, the genetic stability of the vaccine strain can be considered as high. Reversion to virulence is considered to be unlikely. Any risks for humans can be regarded as negligible, as literature data did not reveal any specific risk of zoonosis for wild-type S. equi . Wild type S.equi is only pathogenic for equidae and considered to be  apathogenic  for  humans.  Thus,  this  risk  can  be  regarded  as  even  less  for  a  vaccine  strain  being  a deletion mutant. The environmental risk can also be regarded as very low, as contact animals included in a laboratory safety study were not infected and survival of the vaccine strain in the environment is low.

The basic vaccination consists of 2 vaccinations 4 weeks apart. The duration of immunity is 3 months. Therefore,  re-vaccination  every  3  months  is  required  to  maintain  immunity.  A  priming  response  is maintained for up to six month after basic vaccination. Therefore only a single dose of vaccine is needed to  restore  immunity.  Thus the  vaccine  can  also  be  used  in  the  face  of  an  outbreak  in  these  conditions. Basic vaccination performed during an outbreak is not efficacious, because immunity is insufficient until basic vaccination has been completed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## CONCLUSIONS

- The mild local and systemic reactions induced by vaccination clearly outweigh the severe clinical signs after  a Streptococcus equi infection. The risk  of  other  side  effects is  considered  very  low after  normal  single  dose  treatment.  Therefore  the  risk-benefit  analysis  is  in  favour  of  Equilis StrepE.
- The risk of the vaccine strain in the environment is also considered negligible.
- The risk for veterinarians using Equilis StrepE is considered as negligible.
- Equilis StrepE is recommended for use in horses at risk of S. equi infection and not as a routine vaccination.
