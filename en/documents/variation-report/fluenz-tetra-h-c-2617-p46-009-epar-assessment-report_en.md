Study  D2560C00007  -  a  Phase  3  Open-label  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Safety  of  MEDI3250  in Healthy Japanese Children aged 2 years through 6 years. The rapporteur is of the opinion that the data do not support the requirement for a variation. 1.1. Steps taken for the assessment 24/08/15 CHMP Rapporteur's preliminary assessment report circulated on: 28/09/15 CHMP Rapporteur's updated assessment report circulated on: n/a 2. Assessment of the post-authorisation measure P46 009 This open label, single arm, multicentre study enrolled 100 subjects. The study was designed to gather the safety and tolerability data in Japanese children 2 to 6 years of age that would support approval of MEDI3250 (Fluenz Tetra /FluMist Quadrivalent) in Japan. For  children  age  2  years  through  6  years,  the  recommended  dosage  schedule  for  intranasal administration was 0.2 mL (0.1 mL per nostril). For children not previously vaccinated against seasonal influenza, a second dose was recommended to be given after an interval of at least 4 weeks. For the safety and tolerability endpoints, data were gathered on solicited symptoms, AEs and SAEs. The study was conducted at 3 sites in Japan during the 2014/2015 influenza season. Study duration was 1 to 2 months for each participant. No subjects withdrew from the study or were excluded from the safety population. Medicinal product no longer authorised

AEs  solicited  in  the  study  are  already  rated  in  the  SmPC  to  be  common  or  very  common. However, the frequency of AEs was not compared to the same frequency measured in similar studies.  It  is  thus  not  possible  to  determine  whether  the  reactogenicity  during  2014/2015 season in the Japanese population was higher than the reactogenicity in other seasons or in

The median age of subjects was 4.5 years (mean ± standard deviation [SD]: 4.2 ± 1.4)  and male subjects accounted for 45.0% (45 subjects). Ninety four subjects who had been previously vaccinated for seasonal influenza received one dose of the IP, and the remaining 6 subjects who had not been previously  vaccinated  for  influenza  received  2  doses  of  the  IP  with  at  least  a  28  day-  interval.  A protocol deviation was reported in one subject with a GCP violation. No other protocol deviations or inappropriate treatment compliance including overdose were noted during the study. The overall incidence of any solicited symptoms was 57.0% (57/100 subjects). The common solicited symptoms (≥ 5%) were runny/stuffy nose (51.0%), cough (35.0%), fever ≥ 38.0°C (11.0%), sore throat (10.0%) and headache (5.0%). 42 out of 100 of subjects (42%) experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAEs) after the first dose, and 2 out of 6 subjects (33.3%) after the second dose. The common TEAEs (≥ 4%) reported during the study were nasopharyngitis (13.0%), gastroenteritis (4.0%), pharyngitis (4.0%), and dry skin (4.0%). No new TEAEs, by preferred term, were observed after the second dose. All TEAEs were graded as mild in severity. No deaths, SAEs or TEAEs leading to IP discontinuation were reported. MAH's Conclusion No novel safety signals were detected in this small study conducted in 100 Japanese children 2 through 6 years of age and the vaccine was safe and well tolerated. These data support the continued positive benefit/risk assessment for Fluenz Tetra. 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion Regarding the study, the Rapporteur notes that: The size of the sample permits to identify AEs with an incidence &gt; 2.5% with a probability of ≥ 90%; Medicinal product no longer authorised
