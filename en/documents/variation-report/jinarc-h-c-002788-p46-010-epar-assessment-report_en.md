## 1. Introduction

On 10 Feb 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for paediatric heart failure patients aged from 6 months to less than 15 years with volume overload, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that A Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, dose-defining trial to investigate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Tolvaptan in male and female paediatric heart failure patients aged from 6 months to less than 15 years with volume overload (study number:156102-00123) is a stand alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Pharmaceutical formulations used in this study included Tolvaptan 1% granules or tolvaptan 15 mg tablets not approved in EU.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

Jinarc (tolvaptan) has been authorised in EU since on 27/05/2015. The approved pharmaceutical forms are tablets 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 mg. The approved indication is:

Jinarc is indicated to slow the progression of cyst development and renal insufficiency of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 1 to 4 at initiation of treatment with evidence of rapidly progressing disease (see section 5.1).

Regarding the paediatric population, the safety and efficacy of tolvaptan in children and adolescents has not yet been established. No data are available. Tolvaptan is not recommended in the paediatric age group.

At the time of approval the following obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures, was issued:

- Study 156-102-00123: a Phase 3, Multicenter, Open-label, Dose-defining Trial to Investigate the Efficacy, Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Tolvaptan in Pediatric Heart Failure Patients With Volume Overload.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study 156-102-00123 - A Phase 3, Multicenter, Open-label, Dose-defining Trial to Investigate the Efficacy, Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Tolvaptan in Pediatric Heart Failure Patients With Volume Overload.

## Description

This was a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled, dose-titration trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tolvaptan in male and female pediatric heart failure patients with volume overload despite having received conventional diuretic therapy. Pediatric patients aged 6 months to less than 15 years were included. The target number of subjects for receiving tolvaptan was set at 60. A basic trial design schematic is shown in Figure 9.1-1.

Basic Trial Design Schematic

After completion of a screening examination, subjects were hospitalized prior to the evening meal on 3 days before start of tolvaptan administration. Tolvaptan administration was started at 0.05 mg/kg/day, and subjects with sufficient increase in urine volume continued administration at 0.05 mg/kg/day for 3 days. For subjects whose urine volume did not sufficiently increase (see below for study rule specifications), the dose was increased to 0.15, 0.3, or 0.5 mg/kg/day according to the specification. In that case, the dose was decided for each individual subject to obtain sufficient increase in urine volume, and administration at the decided dose was continued for 3 days. When the dose was increased to 0.5 mg/kg/day, administration at 0.5 mg/kg/day was continued for 3 days. After final tolvaptan administration, subjects continued to be hospitalized for 2 days, so that their condition could be monitored. Subjects also underwent the follow-up 5 to 7 days after final tolvaptan administration.

## Methods

## Study participants

The target patients were divided into 3 age groups (6 months to less than 2 years, 2 years to less than 7 years, and 7 years to less than 15 years).

## Treatments

Subjects took tolvaptan 1% granules or tolvaptan 15 mg tablet with water once daily after breakfast.

The dose of tolvaptan 1% granules to be administered was determined depending on the subject's body weight on the day before start of tolvaptan administration; however, the maximum dose was 15 mg/day even if the calculated dose exceeded 15 mg/day. For administration at the maximum dose of 15 mg, tolvaptan 15-mg tablet was allowed to be administered in place of tolvaptan 1% granules.

The initial dose of tolvaptan was 0.05 mg/kg/day. From the second day of the treatment period and onward, if necessary the dose could be increased to 0.15, 0.3, or 0.5 mg/kg/day according to the increase in urine volume. Decision on up-titration was based on daily urine volume. Dose increase was considered in cases of 'insufficient increase in urine volume' when it was less than 150% of that for the pretreatment observation period (one day before the start of tolvaptan administration), while 'sufficient increase in urine volume' was at least 150%. The dose decided for each individual subject was administered for 3 days. and then the dose decided for each individual subject was administered for 3 days.

## Objective(s)

Primary: To determine the efficacy, safety, and dose and regimen of tolvaptan in pediatric heart failure patients with volume overload.

Secondary: To determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of tolvaptan when administered to pediatric heart failure patients with volume overload.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary Endpoint

The percentage of subjects who satisfied the following condition:

- Body weight on the day after the third day of treatment with tolvaptan at the evaluation dose was decreased by 1.7% or more from the weight measured before breakfast on the first day of the treatment period (the initial tolvaptan administration day).

However, the mean daily urine volume for the 3 days of treatment with tolvaptan at the evaluation dose had to be higher than the daily urine volume for the pretreatment observation period. For subjects who discontinued treatment with tolvaptan, the mean daily urine volume up to the time of discontinuation had to be higher than the daily urine volume for the pretreatment observation period.

## Secondary Endpoints

- Body weight
- Edematous symptoms (edema [lower limbs, eyelids, etc], dyspnea, jugular venous distension, pulmonary congestion, cardiothoracic ratio, respiration rate at rest, pulse rate, and pleural effusion),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

central venous pressure (only subjects with central venous catheterization), and retention of pericardial effusion (only subjects requiring echocardiography to confirm retention of pericardial effusion prior to tolvaptan administration)

- Daily urine volume

## Sample size

For the primary endpoint, the required sample size was set by first setting the threshold value for assessment of efficacy, and then using binomial distribution to determine the number of subjects required to maintain a 90% or higher probability that the lower limit of the 95% CI for the percentage of subjects achieving the primary endpoint above the threshold value.

As reference information for the threshold value and binomial distribution parameter required to set the sample size for the trial, a threshold of 0.3 and a binomial distribution parameter of 0.5 to 0.6 were used based on interviews with clinicians, since no clinical trial results for administration of tolvaptan in pediatric patients have been obtained either in Japan or other countries.

Based on the above, the required number of subjects was calculated to be a minimum of 68 for a parameter of 0.5 and a minimum of 30 for a parameter of 0.6. A sample size of 30 to 68 subjects was therefore considered to be appropriate, and in view of feasibility the number of subjects for the trial was set at 60.

## Statistical Methods

The full analysis set (FAS) includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the IMP and have postdose data on body weight and daily urine volume.

The dose maintenance analysis set includes all subjects who received administration at same dose for at least 3 days in the full analysis set.

The safety analysis set (SAS) includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the IMP.

The pharmacokinetic analysis set includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the IMP and have postdose data on drug concentration.

The pharmacodynamic analysis set includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the IMP and have postdose pharmacodynamic data.

For the primary endpoint analysis, the number and percentage of subjects as well as the exact 95% CI based on binomial distribution were calculated. The same calculations were performed for body weight on the day after the final administration at the evaluation dose and the day after the final administration. The number and percentage of subjects was also calculated for each time point after the start of administration at the evaluation dose (the data to be summarized are from the first day of administration at the evaluation dose to the day after the final administration at the evaluation dose and follow-up period; the same shall apply hereinafter).

Similar calculations were performed for the percent change in body weight as secondary endpoint. For edematous signs, a shift table was prepared for changes in the degree of edema (lower limbs) from baseline to the third day of administration at the evaluation dose, the day of the final administration at the evaluation dose, and the day of the final administration.  In addition, the number and percentage

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of subjects as well as the exact 95% CI based on binomial distribution was calculated for the improvement rate (the percentage of subjects who had symptoms at baseline and showed remarkable improvement or improvement after the IMP administration) and the disappearance rate (the percentage of subjects who had symptoms at baseline and whose symptoms resolved after the IMP administration) on the third day of administration at the evaluation dose, the day of the final administration at the evaluation dose, and the day of the final administration. Analysis was also performed using data collected immediately before the start of administration at the evaluation dose as the baseline (the phrase 'after the IMP administration' for the improvement and disappearance rates was read as that of 'after the start of administration at the evaluation dose').

A shift table was prepared for changes in the degree of pulmonary congestion from baseline through the day after the final administration. The number and percentage of subjects as well as the exact 95% CI based on the binomial distribution was calculated for the improvement and disappearance rates on the day after the final administration.

Subgroup analyses and analyses by the evaluation dose of the primary endpoint, percent changes in body weight, and edematous symptoms were performed for (the day after) the third day of administration at the evaluation dose, the day of (or the day after) the final administration at the evaluation dose, and the day of (or the day after) the final administration (except for the summarization by the number of days that had elapsed since the start of administration).

Investigator judged that it was difficult to contimue the climical trial because of the heavy mental and physical burden on patient and parents due to frequent blood sampling : It is difficult to increase the amount of investigational product because fluid retention has already improved.

: The dose of the treatment drug could not be increased for the safety of the subjects because the weight was decreased

; Serum sodium concentration increased (Serum or blood sodium at 4 to 6 hours after study drug admimistration increased by 8 mEq/L. or more from just before administration).

## Pharmacokinetics results

## Time points of blood sampling

Blood was to be collected before administration, and at 2 to 4, 10 to 14, and approximately 24 hours after administration on the third day of treatment with tolvaptan at 0.05, 0.15, 0.3, or 0.5 mg/kg/day.

Rationale for the time points of blood sampling: To determine the pharmacokinetics of tolvaptan in pediatric heart failure patients, data on the plasma concentrations of tolvaptan (OPC-41061) and its metabolites (DM-4103 and DM-4107) were to be collected. For the time points of blood sampling, a trial in adult CHF patients (Trial 156-06-004) was referred to. As a result of consideration, a total of 4 time points (before administration, at around the peak time [2 to 4 hours after administration], and at times in an elimination phase [10 to 14 hours and 24 hours after administration]) were set, so that the pharmacokinetic parameters of tolvaptan (OPC-41061) could be determined by a population pharmacokinetic analysis, which was to be separately conducted.

In the pharmacokinetic analysis set, the plasma concentrations of tolvaptan (OPC-41061) and its metabolites (DM-4103 and DM-4107) were summarized by descriptive statistics, in the following 2 ways. The doses used for tabulation (0.05, 0.15, 0.3, and 0.5 mg/kg/day) were those on the date of blood sampling.

- Summarization for each compound, time point of blood sampling, and dose
- Summarization for each compound, time point of blood sampling, dose, and age group (young age, 6 months to less than 2 years; middle age, 2 years to less than 7 years; and old age, 7 years to less than 15 years)

Descriptive statistics to be determined were the number of subjects, mean, SD, coefficient of variation, minimum, median, and maximum.

The population pharmacokinetic analysis of tolvaptan (OPC-41061) was to be separately performed and reported.

## Pharmacokinetic results

For tolvaptan (OPC-41061) the changes in the plasma concentrations by subject are shown in the figures below.

Individual OPC-41061 Plasma Concentrations on the Third Day of Admimistration at Each Dose (Phanmacokinetics Analysis Set)

<!-- image -->

The plasma concentrations (mean) of tolvaptan (OPC-41061) reached the maximum values at 2 to 4 hours after administration at all of the evaluation doses of 0.05, 0.15, 0.3, and 0.5 mg/kg/day, and decreased at 10 to 14 hours after administration and at approximately 24 hours after administration. The plasma concentrations of tolvaptan (OPC-41061) at approximately 24 hours after administration were below the lower limit of quantitation (2.00 ng/mL) in 12/13 subjects at 0.05 mg/kg/day, in 5/14 subjects at 0.15 mg/kg/day, in 1/2 subject at 0.3 mg/kg/day, and in 1/5 subject at 0.5 mg/kg/day. The plasma concentrations (mean) at 2 to 4 hours after administration were comparable to those at baseline at 0.15 and 0.3 mg/kg/day, but generally increased in proportion to the evaluation dose.

The plasma concentrations (mean) of DM-4103 at each evaluation dose were highest at 10 to 14 hours after administration or at approximately 24 hours after administration. The plasma concentrations (mean) of DM-4107 at each evaluation dose reached the peak at 2 to 4 or 10 to 14 hours after administration, and decreased at approximately 24 hours after administration.

The number of subjects included in the pharmacokinetic analyses by evaluation dose and by age group, in the order of young, middle, and old age, was 3, 2, and 8 subjects at 0.05 mg/kg/day; 5, 2, and 8 subjects at 0.15 mg/kg/day; 1, 1, and 0 subjects at 0.3 mg/kg/day; and 3, 0, and 2 subjects at 0.5 mg/kg/day. It was limited to 2 or fewer subjects in 1 or more age groups, at all of the evaluation doses. The plasma concentrations (mean) of tolvaptan (OPC-41061) at 0.05 and 0.15 mg/kg/day, at which plasma drug concentration results were obtained in all age groups, showed no trends that were dependent on age-group.

Note: Baseline is defined as 24 hours from Day -1 to Day 1 before IMP administration at treatment period.

For daily urine volume, subjects are counted on the accurately measured data of daily urine volume.

Number of treated subjects with evaluation of the given parameter at each timepoint.

bNumber of treated subjects with both baseline and evaluation of the given parameter at each timepoint.

The percent changes (mean ± SD) from baseline in daily urine volume show increases for the 3 days after the start of administration at the evaluation dose compared to baseline.

The percent changes (mean ± SD) in daily urine volume from before the start of administration at the evaluation dose show increases for the 3 days after the start of administration at the evaluation dose compared to that before the start of administration at the evaluation dose.

Descriptive statistics of the measured values and percent changes from baseline in daily urine volume (mL) at each time point after the start of administration at the evaluation dose in the dose maintenance analysis set are shown by evaluation dose in Table 11.5.3.3.1.1-2.

The percent change (mean) was largest at the evaluation dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day and smallest at 0.5 mg/kg/day. No evaluation dose-dependent changes were observed.

Note: Baseline is defined as 24 hours from Day -1 to Day 1 before IMP administration at treatment period.

For daily urine volume, subjects are counted on the accurately measured data of daily urine volume.

Number of treated subjects with evaluation of the given parameter at each timepoint.

bNumber of treated subjects with both baseline and evaluation of the given parameter at each timepoint.

When analysed by age subgroups, the results showed increases compared to baseline for the 3 days after the start of administration at the evaluation dose in all age groups. The percent changes were slightly smaller in the young age group than in the middle and old age groups.

The changes (mean ± SD) from baseline in daily fluid intake show increases for the 3 days after the start of administration at the evaluation dose compared to baseline.

The changes (mean ± SD) in daily fluid intake from before the start of administration at the evaluation dose show increases for the 3 days after the start of administration at the evaluation dose compared to that before the start of administration at the evaluation dose.

The change (mean) was largest at the evaluation dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day and smallest at 0.5 mg/kg/day. No evaluation dose-dependent changes were observed.

## Daily Fluid Balance

For measured values and changes from baseline in daily fluid balance (mL) in the pharmacodynamic analysis set, descriptive statistics at each time point after the start of administration at the evaluation dose are shown in Table 11.5.3.3.1.3-1.

Note: Baseline is defined as 24 hours from Day -1 to Day 1 before IMP administration at treatment period.

For daily fluid balance, subjects are counted on the accurately measured data of daily urine volume

Number of treated subjects with evaluation of the given parameter at each timepoint.

bNumber of treated subjects with both baseline and evaluation of the given parameter at each timepoint.

The changes (mean ± SD) from baseline in daily fluid balance show decreases on the first and second days of administration at the evaluation dose compared to baseline, but no marked change on the third day.

The changes (mean ± SD) in daily fluid balance from before the start of administration at the evaluation dose show decreases for the 3 days after the start of administration at the evaluation dose compared to that before the start of administration at the evaluation dose.

While no decrease was observed at the evaluation dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day compared to baseline, decreases were observed at 0.05, 0.15, and 0.3 mg/kg/day. No evaluation dose-dependent changes were observed.

When analysed by age subgroups, the results showed decreases for the 3 days after the start of administration at the evaluation dose compared to the time point before the start of administration at the evaluation dose in the middle and old age groups, and decreases on the first and second days of administration at the evaluation dose in the young age group.

Note: Baseline is defined as 24 hours from Day -1 to Day 1 before IMP administration at treatment period.

For urine osmolality, subjects are counted on the measured data of whole urine collection.

Number of treated subjects with evaluation of the given parameter at each timepoint.

The change (mean) from baseline in urine osmolality from the start of administration at the evaluation dose to the third day show a decrease for the 3 days after the start of administration at the evaluation dose compared to baseline.

The change (mean) in urine osmolality from before the start of administration at the evaluation dose to the third day show a decrease for the 3 days after the start of administration at the evaluation dose compared to that before the start of administration at the evaluation dose.

## Pharmacodynamic conclusions

Data by the number of days that had elapsed since the start of the tolvaptan administration showed that the percent change (mean) from baseline in daily urine volume was from 18.9% to 46.4%, and that the changes (mean) in daily fluid intake and daily fluid balance were from 164.5 to 365.5 mL and -98.9 to 18.4 mL, respectively. The daily urine volume and daily fluid intake increased compared to baseline for the 3 days after the start of administration at the evaluation dose. The daily fluid balance decreased compared to baseline on the first and second days of administration at the evaluation dose, but did not change markedly on the third day.

Urine osmolality decreased compared to baseline for the 3 days after the start of administration at the evaluation dose. No significant changes were observed in daily urine sodium excretion or daily urine potassium excretion.

Serum osmolality and serum or blood sodium concentration increased slightly compared to baseline, for the 3 days after the start of administration at the evaluation dose. There were no marked changes in serum or blood potassium concentration.

Plasma AVP concentration on the day after the final administration increased compared to baseline.

## AEs by age group

The incidence of AEs by age group was 50% (10/20 subjects) in the young age group, 37.5% (6/16 subjects) in the middle age group, and 41.7% (10/24 subjects) in the old age group. The AEs that occurred in at least 2 subjects in the young age group were pyrexia and thirst (two subjects each, 10%).

No AEs occurred in the middle age group.

The AEs occurring in at least 2 subjects in the oldest age group were vomiting, thirst, and hyperkaelimia (2 subjects each, 8.3%).

## Deaths

No deaths occurred in this trial.

## Other SAEs

An SAE occurred in 1/60 subjects (1.7%). The SAE that occurred was cardiac failure chronic, and was determined to be unrelated to the IMP. The subject was between 10 and 13 years old at the evaluation dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day. after the completion of the treatment with the IMP, the event occurred on Day 8 (5 days affetr the completion of treatment) and resolved on day 17 after onset (21 days after the completion of treatment).

## AEs of special interest

The AEs of special interest in this trial were dehydration and renal impairment. Dehydration and renal impairment were reported in one subject each (the same subject). The subject who experienced dehydration and renal impairment was a between 11 and 14 years old; both of these two events were determined to be unrelated to the IMP. All of the events were mild in severity and occurred on Day 5 (4 days after discontinuation), and the outcome was unresolved.

## Discussion on clinical aspects

According to Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the MAH has submitted the results of a paediatric clinical trial with tolvaptan in patients with heart failure. The presented data pertain a shortterm administration of tolvaptan in a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, dose-defining trial to investigate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug in male and female paediatric heart failure patients with volume overload, aged from 6 months to less than 15

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

years. The study design contemplated an initial 3 day-hospitalisation period before IMP administration, followed by an up-titration scheme starting at 0.05 mg/kg/day that was progressively increased to 0.15, 0.3, or 0.5 mg/kg/day according with daily urine volume. Dose augmentation was considered in cases of 'insufficient increase in urine volume' when it was less than 150% of that for the pretreatment observation period (one day before the start of tolvaptan administration). Once reached the target dose (i.e. evaluation dose), treatment was maintained for 3 days, and that period was considered for efficacy evaluation. The dose range was empirically chosen, based on the adult dose finding trials and post-marketing experience in Japan.

The study was conducted in Japan, where a MA is in place for tolvaptan in the treatment of heart failure in adults. This is indication is not licensed in the EU, nor a paediatric line of extension is herein pursued.

## Pharmacokinetics

The plasma concentrations (mean) of tolvaptan (OPC-41061) reached the maximum value at 2 to 4 hours after administration, and subsequently decreased. The MAH states that plasma concentrations (mean) of tolvaptan (OPC-41061) at 0.05 and 0.15 mg/kg/day, at which plasma drug concentration results were obtained in all age groups, showed no trends that were dependent on age-group. However, no clear graphical or tabular data are reported to allow drawing firm conclusions.

In addition, it is not clear why pharmacokinetic analysis set included only 44/60 participants, i.e. why post dose samples are not available for a significant number of subjects.

Subjects took tolvaptan 1% granules or tolvaptan 15 mg tablet with water once daily after breakfast. The impact of the different formulations used on pharmacokinetics cannot be excluded, since it is not clear if bioequivalence was demonstrated.

## Pharmacodynamics

Pharmacodynamics parameters were well described and analysed, age subgroups analysis was performed, even though numbers are small.

## Efficacy and Safety

Definition of treatment response was derived from the clinical experience with tolvaptan as accumulated in the adult heart failure setting. Specifically, based on the body weight reduction of 1.27 kg observed 3 days post-treatment initiation in adults, a cut-off of 1.5 kg in body weight decrease on Day 3 was taken for the efficacy evaluation in children. Body weight reduction was under the condition that the mean daily urine volume for the 3 days of treatment with tolvaptan at the evaluation dose was higher than the daily urine volume for the pre-treatment observation period.  By acknowledging the general lack of a standardised measure of diuretic responsiveness, the primary endpoint appears quite controversial since body weight fluctuations do not represent changes in volume distribution, and poorly correlate with fluid output. This measure appears even weaker in the paediatric setting, particularly in the youngest ages. As a more solid measure of decongestion, a net fluid output would have been more informative or, alternatively and as recently suggested in a position paper from the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology (2019), a combination of biomarkers and clinical parameters should have been considered for clinical efficacy determination.

In total, 60 patients were exposed to tolvaptan for a mean duration of 4.8 ± 2.2 days. Evaluation dose groups included 0.05 mg/kg/day (36.7%), 0.15 mg/kg/day (40%), 0.3 mg/kg/day (10%) and 0.5 mg/kg/day (13.3%). The IMP treatment periods (mean ± SD) by evaluation dose were 2.7 ± 0.6 days at 0.05 mg/kg/day, 4.9 ± 0.9 days at 0.15 mg/kg/day, 6.5 ± 0.8 days at 0.3 mg/kg/day, and 9.0 ± 0.0 days at 0.5 mg/kg/day. The sample size was calculated based on a value for assessment of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

efficacy as defined by the primary endpoint, and then using binomial distribution to determine the for the percentage of subjects achieving the primary endpoint.

The percentage of subjects whose body weight was decreased by 1.7% or more from baseline on the day after the third day of administration at the evaluation dose was 22.8% (13/57 subjects; 95% CI [0.127, 0.358]). A similar percentage of 'responders' was identified across all the different dose ranges (around 25%) with the exception of the highest dose group, for which a reduced response to treatment (12.5%) was registered. Lack of dose-dependency would be expected in an individualised up-titration scheme as defined in the study protocol. Of note, the highest dose of tolvaptan was most frequently employed in the youngest patients (75% of those receiving 0.5 mg/kg/day were aged between 6 month-&lt;2 years), while the oldest patients were more prevalent in the lower dose ranges (45% and 50% of those receiving 0.05 mg/kg/day and 0.15 mg/kg/day were aged between 7-15 was almost comparable across dose groups.  It could be that disease severity varied across ages, and this might justify the worse response rate observed at the highest dose. However, data on disease severity were not collected during the study; therefore, this hypothesis remains a speculative observation.

number of subjects required to maintain a 90% or higher probability that the lower limit of the 95% CI According with the baseline characteristics, the recruited population showed a representation of the three pre-defined age groups (6 months-1 year: 33.9%; 2-6 years: 27.1%; 7-14 years:14%) which is in line with disease epidemiology for time of diagnosis. Only Asian patients were recruited, with 47.5% and 52.5% of male and female sex, respectively. Surgical history was present in 76.3% of the population. As expected, congenital heart disease and cardiomyopathy leading to either overcirculation failure or pump failure, were among the most common causes of heart failure in the studied population. Of note, a wide variety of symptomatology was included encompassing Class II and III of the disease severity grading system adopted in children (i.e. NYHA or Ross). Indeed, the majority was symptomatic at the time of recruitment (98.3%), as per inclusion criteria requiring patients to present with volume overload and inadequate response to 'conventional diuretic therapy'. The definition was left to the investigator, leading to the recruitment of a heterogeneous population in terms of concomitant diuretic medications that mostly reflects clinical practice. The majority of patients were on a combination of loop diuretics and anti-aldosterone drugs (76.3%), while a minority was on monotherapy with loop diuretics (10.2%), or Loop diuretic + Thiazide diuretic + Antialdosterone drug (11.9%). According with clinical practice and as a standard-of-care, additional heart failure medications were concomitantly used with tolvaptan, including the phosphodiesterase inhibitor milrinone (administrated to 20% of participants on Day 1), and digoxin (used in 8.3% of patients on Day 1). years, respectively). The use of concomitant medications including diuretics and anti-aldosterone drugs

As regards the secondary endpoint, namely the  percentage of body weight change from baseline, the trend was generally consistent with the primary endpoint variations, showing a dose-independent reduction by 0.7%, 0.2% and 1.5% in the 0.05, 0.15 and 0.3 mg/kg/day group respectively, while an increase in body weight from baseline was observed in the 0.5 mg/kg/day dose, which could be attributed to either a reduced individual response or increased disease severity in the group receiving the highest dose. The requested dose and age subgroup characterisation could offer insight into these data. However, the clinical meaning of this observation remains unclear taking into consideration the abovementioned poor correlation between body weight fluctuations and volume distribution. In keeping with this, the clinical response as evaluated by signs of congestion was generally better compared to the primary endpoint results, and was overall consistent across the different dose groups, although missing a clear dose-dependency. Improvement in peripheral oedema was registered in 68.6% of the population, and resolution of symptoms occurred in 65.7% of patients; the proportion of responders progressively augmented by dose increase between 0.05 and 0.3 mg/kg/day (from 81.8% to 100% for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

improvement and 72.7% and 100% for disappearance), although falling in the highest dose group (0.5 mg/kg/day; 40% for improvement and disappearance, respectively). More variable trends were observed for improvement in jugular venous distension (50% in all groups with the exception of 0.5mg/kg/day registering 25% response) and pulmonary congestion (59.3%, 63.6%, 50% and 16.7% in the four dose groups); their respective disappearance rates were similar, suggesting a variable individual response. Finally, evaluation of daily urine volume as indicative of the aquaretic effect of tolvaptan, showed  dose-independent percent changes (mean ± SD) from baseline and high interindividual variability,  based on the values on the first day of administration at the evaluation dose in the dose maintenance analysis (86.4 ± 67.2% at 0.05 mg/kg/day, 56.5 ± 48.9% at 0.15 mg/kg/day, 57.5 ± 3.3% at 0.3 mg/kg/day, and 14.7 ± 11.3% at 0.5 mg/kg/day) and the full analysis set (53.1 ± 52.9% on the first day of administration at the evaluation dose, 47.8 ± 43.3% on the second day, and 45.8 ± 29.3% on the third day).

At the subgroup analysis, the intermediate 2-6 year age category had the lowest percentage of responders based on the primary endpoint (14.3% compared to 30% and 21.7% of the 6 months-1 year and 7-14 year group, respectively), while achieving the best clinical response when evaluating oedema improvement (47.3% compared to 27.7% and 38.4% of the 6 months-1 year and 7-14 year group, respectively) and disappearance rates (87.5% compared to 50% and 66.7% of the 6 months-1 year and 7-14 year group, respectively).

From a safety perspective, the incidence of AEs was 43.3% in the total population, with AEs related to the IMP occurring in 16.7% of patients. A consistent rate of events was observed across age groups and dose ranges. No deaths were reported, nor cases of acute liver toxicity were registered in this trial. The majority of AEs by SOC categories included gastrointestinal disorders (13.3%), general disorders and administration site conditions (10.0%), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (8.3%). AEs occurring with common frequency were thirst (6.7%) and anaemia, constipation, dry mouth, vomiting, pyrexia, and hyperkalaemia (3.3% for all of them). AEs were more often mild in severity (35.0%), with only a minority reporting moderate AEs (6.7%) and one patient (1.7%) developing a serious event, namely cardiac failure that was judged unrelated to the IMP. This was about a 13-old boy with dilated cardiomyopathy receiving tolvaptan 0.05 mg/kg/day for 3 days who suffered acute cardiac decompensation 5 days post-last dose administration. On revision of this case, no concerns arise. Among IMP-related AEs, General disorders and administration site conditions (i.e. pyrexia 1.7%; and thirst 6.7%) were the most frequent (8.3%), followed by gastrointestinal disorders (5.5%; dry mouth 3.3% and constipation 1.7%); polydipsia, dizziness and neutropenia occurred with a frequency of 1.7%.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

In conclusion, based on the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, the MAH claims treatment efficacy for Jinarc (tolvaptan) in children aged from 6 months to less than 15 years with heart failure and signs of congestions not controlled by conventional diuretic therapy. However, the benefit of treatment in the short-term remains undefined due to the abovementioned study limitations, and information on the long-term effect are currently unavailable. No new safety signals emerged in this paediatric investigation. The safety profile for this short-term course of tolvaptan administration appears manageable and in line with the adult clinical experience accumulated so far. Considering that the MAH is not pursuing a paediatric indication in the EU, the presented data have only a limited clinical and regulatory impact.
