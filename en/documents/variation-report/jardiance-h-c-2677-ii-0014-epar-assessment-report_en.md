## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 9 November 2015 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Modification of the indication for Jardiance to reflect new data on cardiovascular outcomes based on study 1245.25 (EMPA-REG OUTCOME).

In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to make some editorial changes.

Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) P/0211/2015on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP not yet completed as some measures were deferred

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is an increasingly prevalent disease. Recent estimates suggest that the number of people worldwide with diabetes is currently 382 million and is expected to reach at least 592 million within the next 25 years. The most common form is type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which is characterized by insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and increased glucose production by the liver.

Type 2 diabetes is frequently associated with comorbidities that exacerbate cardiovascular (CV) risk, such as obesity and hypertension. The risk of CV disease is increased approximately 2 to 4-fold in adults with diabetes. The risk of heart failure is increased more than 2-fold in patients with T2DM, and heart failure in these patients is associated with a poor prognosis. Recommended strategies for reducing CV risk in patients with T2DM include glucose management, lipid lowering, blood pressure (BP) control, smoking cessation, and weight loss [R14-0344]. There is a clear association between microvascular complications such as albuminuria and an increased risk of CV events in patients with T2DM, and improved glycaemic control has been associated with a reduction in microvascular events. However, the impact of reducing blood glucose and the potential benefit of specific glucose-lowering agents on CV events in patients with T2DM remains unclear and highly controversial. Thus, there is a strong clinical need to identify antihyperglycaemic agents that are safe and can potentially reduce cardiovascular and microvascular complications.

Empagliflozin is a novel, orally administered, potent, and selective SGLT-2 inhibitor developed by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI). Empagliflozin is currently indicated for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in conjunction with diet and exercise, as monotherapy or as add-on therapy to other oral antidiabetic treatments or insulin. Empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg once daily is approved in more than 50 countries including the EU and the US.

In this application, the proposed new indications, as initially proposed by the applicant, are to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality by reducing CV deaths and to reduce the risk of CV death or hospitalisation for heart

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

failure, in patients with T2DM and high CV risk. The proposed indications are based on the results from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME (trial 1245.25).

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non- clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The MAH has provided a justification for not submitting an environmental assessment update.

As the target population and the maximum daily dose (25 mg) are not changed as a result of this variation, the CHMP agrees that the ERA submitted with the initial MAA remains valid for the current type II variation.

## 2.2.2. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of empagliflozin. Empagliflozin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

In this dossier, (only) the results of the cardiovascular outcome trial are presented. In this outcome trial, limited PK data were collected. The design of the trial is discussed below under clinical efficacy.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

Limited pharmacokinetic data were collected during the EMPA-REG trial. No changes to the product documentation are proposed.

Steady-state morning trough concentrations of empagliflozin were evaluated on Days 85 and 364. In this study patients were treated with Empagliflozin 10mg or 25mg once daily. Empagliflozin trough concentrations were similar within each dose group at both time points indicating that steady-state concentrations of empagliflozin were maintained during the course of the trial. The increase in empagliflozin exposure with dose was roughly proportional to dose.

Empagliflozin exposures were generally similar in men and women at both dose levels. There were no relevant changes in empagliflozin exposure with an increase in gender, age or body weight. No specific trends were observed by geographic region or country. There were no major differences in exposure in different races or ethnicities. Empagliflozin exposure increased with a decrease in renal function. These findings are consistent with the results of the previous population pharmacokinetic analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In subjects with renal insufficiency, dose-normalised geometric mean plasma trough concentrations are increased up to 2.8 fold in patients with severe renal impairment compared to patients with a normal renal function (Figure 1). These results are in line with the previously observed higher AUCss of empagliflozin in patients with renal impairment as reflected in the current SmPC.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

No specific pharmacodynamic data were submitted. For results regarding HbA1c and FPG, please refer to the section on Further Efficacy endpoints (see section 2.4.1).

## Mechanism of action

The current SmPC contains information about the regulation of glucose by empagliflozin. However, the proposed CV prevention indication likely has another mode of action that is not directly related to glycaemic control. This is even more relevant in subjects with renal insufficiency, where the effect on glycaemic control was limited but the effect for CV prevention is preserved.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

In this application, a single trial is submitted (EMPA-REG, 1245.25). This trial is discussed below and summarised in Table 16.

The study was performed in patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk who had insufficient glycaemic control despite diet and exercise and were either treatment-naïve (drug-naïve) or receiving any antidiabetic background therapy.

The inclusion criteria specify a population at high risk for CV events, specified by the combination of T2DM and a history of CV disease, defined as at least one of the following:

-  confirmed history of myocardial infarction (MI) (&gt;2 months prior to informed consent);
-  evidence of coronary artery disease (in ≥2 major coronary arteries or single vessel coronary artery disease (significant stenosis with positive non-invasive stress test or with previous hospitalisation for unstable angina); last episode of unstable angina &gt;2 months prior to informed consent);
-  history of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke (&gt;2 months prior to informed consent);
-  presence of peripheral artery disease (symptomatic or not).

Patients could only be included if glycaemic control was insufficient (HbA1c 7-9% for treatment-naïve patients, 7-10% for patients already on glucose-lowering therapy).

Contrary to the current SmPC of Jardiance, subjects with moderate renal insufficiency (eGFR between 30 and 60 ml/min 1.73m 2 ) were fully eligible for all treatments.

## Treatments

Empagliflozin was administered in 10 mg or 25 mg doses once daily and compared to placebo. The study treatment is in line with the current SmPC of Jardiance for subjects with normal renal function or mild renal impairment (eGFR &gt; 60 ml/min 1.73m 2 ).

However, according to the SmPC for subjects with moderate renal insufficiency (eGFR between 45 and 60 ml/min 1.73m 2 ) only the 10 mg dose should be used and therapy should not be initiated. Therapy should be withdrawn if the eGFR remains below 45 ml/min 1.73m 2 .

All patients received trial medication on top of standard-of-care treatment, which could be adapted if indicated. Background antidiabetic medication was to be kept stable in the first 12 weeks but could be changed thereafter to achieve standard of care according to investigator's discretion and local guidelines.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this event-driven study was to determine non-inferiority (with a non-inferiority margin of 1.3) and subsequently superiority of empagliflozin treatment (2 pooled doses, 10 mg once daily and 25 mg once daily) vs. placebo based on the composite of 3 major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE): cardiovascular death, non-fatal stroke, or non-fatal MI in patients with T2DM and increased cardiovascular risk. The procedure guaranteed control of the type 1 error.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of 3-point MACE (major adverse cardiovascular events; composite of any of the following: cardiovascular death, non-fatal stroke, or non-fatal myocardial infarction). The key secondary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of 4-point MACE (cardiovascular death, non-fatal stroke, or non-fatal myocardial infarction, or hospitalisation for unstable angina pectoris).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

These events were prospectively adjudicated using pre-specified definitions by an independent clinical events committee (CEC), blinded to treatment allocation.

In addition, around 40 secondary and other endpoints were analysed.

## Sample size

The primary hypothesis originally aimed to assess the non-inferiority of empagliflozin versus placebo based on a non-inferiority margin of 1.8 for the hazard ratio but later this was amended (see below) to a non-inferiority margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio. Assuming a non-inferiority margin of 1.3 and 90% power, with a significance level of 0.025 (one-sided), with the empagliflozin and placebo patients in 2:1 ratio, a minimum of 691 events were required to achieve the primary aim of the trial (using a Haybittle-Peto boundary that preserved 0.0249 of the alpha for the final analysis). The trial would continue until a minimum of 691 patients had experienced an adjudicated primary outcome event.

While the number of required events was independent of the accrual and follow-up time and independent of the yearly event rates, the number of patients to be randomised was dependent on these parameters. To obtain the minimum 691 events, based on 7000 patients, assuming an accrual period of 24 months, a yearly event rate of 1.5%, and a randomisation rate of 3500 patients/year, the trial duration was anticipated to be just under 8 years. The planned treatment duration of the patients was therefore up to 8 years, with approximately 8 years (approximately 420 weeks) as the planned total duration of trial. With a minimum of 691 events, the trial would have at least 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.785 (corresponding to a 21.5% risk reduction in cardiovascular outcome events) for the primary endpoint.

## Randomisation

Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment groups (empagliflozin 10 mg; empagliflozin 25 mg; placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomisation was stratified in a balanced ratio for HbA1c (&lt;8.5 or ≥8.5% at screening), BMI (&lt;30 or ≥30 kg/m2 at randomisation), geographical regions (North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, and Asia), and renal function at screening (normal: eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2; mild impairment: eGFR 60 to ≤89 mL/min/1.73m2; moderate impairment: eGFR 30 to ≤59 mL/min/1.73m2).

## Blinding (masking)

The placebo run-in period of this trial was performed open-label, i.e. both the investigator and the patient knew that the patient received placebo during the run-in period. The randomised period of this trial was performed double-blind according to current standards. The interim analysis was performed by a separate team.

## Statistical methods

For confirmatory testing, the hazard ratio (HR) of empagliflozin (10 mg and 25 mg combined; designated as 'all empagliflozin' in the document) to placebo was to be analysed with a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Non-inferiority on the primary endpoint was to be tested based on the non-inferiority margin of 1.3 and the overall significance level of alpha=0.025 (1-sided). If non-inferiority for the primary endpoint could be established for the 1.3 margin, non-inferiority would be tested for the key secondary endpoint based on the same margin. If non-inferiority was established for both endpoints, superiority was to be tested for the primary endpoint and then the key secondary endpoint. The significance level of the final analysis was slightly adapted due to an interim analysis of the trial data.

The primary and key secondary endpoints were tested for non-inferiority and superiority using a 4-step hierarchical testing strategy, which will protect the overall type I error. The non-inferiority margin was set at 1.3.

A number of additional secondary and further endpoints related to CV safety and microvascular safety were analysed in an exploratory manner, based on adjudicated events, reported adverse events, or laboratory

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

data. These included the components of the composite CV and microvascular endpoints as individual endpoints, as well as a composite of heart failure requiring hospitalisation or CV death, all-cause mortality, and a composite of new or worsening nephropathy.

The main analysis for each endpoint followed the 'intent-to-treat (ITT)' principle, using the treated set (TS) and including all events up to individual trial completion. In addition, on-treatment analyses for CV endpoints based on the 'treatment-emergent' principle were performed using the on-treatment set (OS, included only patients with at least 30 days of cumulative treatment and considered only events up to 30 days after treatment stop). Furthermore, analyses using the TS with various lengths of follow-up time (such as 7 or 30 days) after treatment stop were performed for CV endpoints (see Figure 2 below).

Figure 2. Illustration of the analyses based on the TS and OS

The primary analysis will be on the ITT population and performed with a Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by age, sex, baseline categories of BMI, baseline HbA1c, baseline eGFR values and geographical region, performed on the ITT population. This is considered standard for time to event endpoints. For sensitivity analyses, the primary endpoint was further tested in the on-treatment set and the per-protocol set. Secondary and exploratory time-to-event endpoints used the same analysis model as the primary endpoint. UACR and eGFR were analysed with the mixed model repeated measures approach (MMRM), using the observed data. Other categorical endpoints were analysed using an ANCOVA model with LOCF. An interim analysis was performed in 2012 to provide data for a cardiovascular meta-analysis submitted in the initial marketing application. The overall type I error rate was maintained at a one-sided significance level of 0.025 using a Haybittle-Peto correction, resulting in α=0.0001 for the interim analysis and 0.0249 for the final analysis, to protect the overall type I error at 0.025 one-sided.

## Results

## Participant flow

Of the 7020 patients treated with randomised trial medication, 97.0% of the patients completed the trial. Vital status information at the end of the trial was available for all but 53 patients (0.8%). Disposition in terms of trial completion and the availability of vital status was balanced across the 3 treatment groups (Figure 3). The proportions of patients who prematurely discontinued trial medication were higher in the placebo group than in the empagliflozin groups; the most frequent reasons were adverse events (placebo: 13.0%; empagliflozin 10 mg: 11.4%; empagliflozin 25 mg: 11.7%).

## Recruitment

This trial was a multi-centre trial conducted globally. A total of 11531 patients signed informed consent, i.e. were screened or enrolled, at 609 centres in 42 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Latin America and Australia/New Zealand (the last 2 countries were grouped with North America for the purpose of the analyses). The first patient was enrolled into this trial on 26 Aug 2010. The last on-site visit of a patient took place on 13 Apr 2015. The last contact date with any patient in the trial was 21 Apr 2015.

The majority of randomised patients came from Europe (41.1%) and North America (19.8%).

## Conduct of the study

This trial was conducted according to the original trial protocol dated 10 May 2010 and its revisions. There were 4 global protocol amendments leading to 4 global protocol revisions (dated 22 Sep 2010, 22 Apr 2011, 29 Dec 2011, 15 Oct 2013).

With amendment nr 3, prior to the interim analysis, the non-inferiority margin was reduced from 1.8 to 1.3 and the sample size increased accordingly from 4000 to 7000 patients to meet regulatory requirements. The required number of events increased from 137 to 691. The anticipated treatment duration of the patients was changed from 3-4 years to 6-8 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Also with amendment nr 3, the primary endpoint was reworded to make it clear that silent MI was not included in the definition (time to the first occurrence of MACE-3).

## Baseline data

Demographics and baseline characteristics were well balanced across the 3 treatment groups. For brevity, only overall data are shown and no breakdown per group (Table 1).

Of note, slightly fewer patients in the placebo group compared to 'all empagliflozin' reported a history of recurrent or chronic urinary tract infection (5.6% v 6.7%).

In the placebo group, more medications were introduced during the trial, especially antidiabetic (31.5% placebo v. 19.5% empagliflozin) and anti-hypertensive (51.0% v 44.5%).

## Numbers analysed

Several analysis sets were defined for the various analyses in this trial. An overview of the number of patients in each analysis set is provided in the table below. The treated set (TS) was used for the primary analysis. It comprised all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication and thus excluded 8 randomised but not treated patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The RS, TS, FAS, PPS and OS all included at least 98.2% of randomised patients in each group and thus largely overlap.

According to the disposition of patients, 1780 (25.4%) of patients prematurely discontinued trial medication. In line with the ITT principle these patients were followed up and remained in the trial. The results in these patients were consistent with the on-treatment and per protocol analyses.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary endpoint: 3-point MACE

The primary endpoint (3-point MACE) was the time to first occurrence of CV death (including fatal stroke and fatal MI), non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. The primary analysis based on the TS showed superiority of 'all empagliflozin' treatment to placebo (Table 3).

The Kaplan-Meier estimates for time to first 3-point MACE are shown in Figure 4 below.

Exploratory analyses were performed for the individual empagliflozin doses. The results were consistent with those for 'all empagliflozin', with no relevant differences observed between the 2 doses. The similarity of the hazard ratio point estimate of 'all empagliflozin' and the 2 doses supports the robustness of the primary analysis. Due to the smaller sample size (thus a loss of statistical power) in the analysis for the individual doses, the p-values of empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg vs. placebo treatment were not significant (p&gt;0.05; Table 4 below).

The primary analysis based on TS described above included all events until individual trial completion, following the ITT principle. Results from the sensitivity and additional analyses (such as on-treatment analysis and analysis based on the per-protocol set) were generally consistent with the results of the primary analysis, but in the per protocol analysis statistical significance was not reached (Table 3 and Table 5 below).

The breakdown of the first event for 3-point MACE indicated that the lower frequency of 3-point MACE for empagliflozin was primarily due to the lower frequency of CV death (Table 6 below). Assessments of the

time to first events for each MACE component as individual outcome endpoint are described in the sections below, and confirmed a reduction in CV death with empagliflozin treatment.

## Key secondary endpoint: 4-point MACE

The key secondary endpoint (4-point MACE) was the time to first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalisation for unstable angina pectoris. Empagliflozin (doses pooled) was non-inferior, but not superior, to placebo based on this endpoint (Table 7 below). The result of the additional component in the 4-point MACE, hospitalisation for unstable angina pectoris, showed no significant difference between empagliflozin and placebo treatment.

1  Based on the reduced alpha level of 0.0249 resulting from the interim analysis

The results from the analyses of the individual empagliflozin doses vs. placebo were consistent with those for 'all empagliflozin', with no relevant differences observed between the 2 doses. Results from all sensitivity analyses were consistent with the results of the main analysis following the ITT principle.

## Component: CV death (and all-cause mortality)

The risk of CV death and all-cause mortality was significantly reduced in the 'all empagliflozin' group and the individual dose groups compared with the placebo group. There were no obvious differences between the two empagliflozin dose groups. The majority of all deaths were CV deaths, but also non-CV death was numerically reduced in the empagliflozin groups compared with the placebo group (Table 8 below). The additional analyses using an on-treatment approach showed results consistent with the main analyses following the ITT analysis principle. Also, an analysis for time to all-cause mortality assuming all 36 patients lost to follow up in the empagliflozin groups as deceased further confirmed the robustness of the main analysis (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.93; post hoc ). The analyses of subgroups (including by age, sex, renal function, glucose control and medication use at baseline; performed for CV death and all-cause mortality post hoc ) showed consistent results across all subgroups.

The most prevalent categorisation of the CV deaths were 'other CV death', including fatal events deemed not assessable by the CEC (129 of 309 patients with CV death), followed by sudden deaths (91) and worsening of heart failure (30). The majority of the non-CV deaths at system organ class (SOC) level were benign, malignant and unspecified neoplasms (incl. cysts and polyps; 69 of 154 patients with non-CV deaths) and infections and infestations (37).

For both CV death and all-cause mortality, the separation of the event rates between empagliflozin and placebo started shortly after trial onset and was maintained throughout the trial (Figure 8).

## Component: Stroke and Cerebrovascular disease-related outcomes

For stroke (fatal/non-fatal), non-fatal stroke, and transient ischaemic attack (TIA), no significant difference was observed between empagliflozin and placebo (Table 10). Strokes were classified into ischaemic, haemorrhagic, and type not assessable by the CEC neurology. The majority of confirmed strokes were ischaemic.

Although not statistically significant, the hazard ratio point estimate for stroke was above 1. Therefore stroke results were further investigated. In the TS analysis including all events up to individual trial completion, the Kaplan-Meier estimates showed almost no difference between empagliflozin (both doses) and placebo in the probability of stroke up to Day 600; thereafter, empagliflozin 10 mg started to separate from placebo, and empagliflozin 25 mg after about Day 900 (Figure 9). For patients in Europe, the differences are larger and the separation appears earlier (around Day 180) for both doses (Figure 10).

When analysing treatment-emergent stroke using a cut-off for the observation period after treatment stop (7, 30, 90 days after treatment stop on TS; 30 days after treatment stop on OS; see Figure 2), the results showed no significant differences between empagliflozin and placebo, and the hazard ratio point estimate shifted towards unity when compared with the analysis of all events following the ITT analysis principle (Figure 10). The difference between empagliflozin and placebo in the ITT analysis was largely caused by more events occurring beyond 90 days after treatment stop in the empagliflozin groups (10 mg: 11 patients with stroke; 25 mg: 7 patients) than in the placebo group (3 patients).

In the subgroup analyses of time to first stroke, a nominal treatment-by-subgroup interaction p-value &lt;0.05 was observed for the parameters baseline HbA1c and geographic region.

## Heart failure-related outcomes

Heart failure endpoints were analysed in exploratory manner. The risk was reduced in the 'all empagliflozin' group and the individual dose groups compared with the placebo group. There were no obvious differences between the 2 empagliflozin dose groups (Table 11). The additional analyses using an on-treatment approach showed results consistent with the main analyses which followed the ITT principle. The analyses of subgroups (including by age, sex, renal function, glucose control, cardiac failure based on SMQ, diuretics and other medication use at baseline; performed for the first 2 heart failure endpoints) showed consistent results across all subgroups. Moreover, the frequencies of patients with AEs requiring hospitalisation (a criterion for SAE) were numerically lower in the empagliflozin groups (10 mg: 32.0%; 25 mg: 34.9%) than placebo (36.5%)

For all heart failure endpoints, the separation of the event rates between empagliflozin and placebo started shortly after trial onset and was maintained throughout the trial (Figure 12)

## Composite microvascular endpoints

The composite microvascular outcome was defined as the time to first occurrence of any of the following nephropathy or eye related events:

-  New or worsening nephropathy defined as any of the following:
- o New onset of macroalbuminuria (UACR &gt;300 mg/g)
- o Doubling of serum creatinine level accompanied by an eGFR ≤45 mL/min/1.73m 2
- o Initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy
- o Death due to renal disease
-  Diabetic eye complications
- o Initiation of retinal photocoagulation
- o Vitreous haemorrhage
- o Diabetes-related blindness (included any blindness reported)

For the two composite microvascular outcome endpoints, the risk was reduced in the 'all empagliflozin' group compared with the placebo group (patients with event placebo: 424 (20.5%); all empa: 577 (14.0%); HR 0.62 95% CI: 0.54, 0.70). There was a similar treatment effect for the 2 empagliflozin dose groups. The majority of the events of the microvascular outcome endpoints were new onset of nephropathy (see the section below). For all diabetic eye complication endpoints, the incidence rates were low (&lt;5/1000 patient-year) and no significant difference was observed between empagliflozin and placebo.

## Nephropathy-related endpoints

## Nephropathy composite endpoints and components as independent endpoints

For the composite nephropathy endpoints ('new or worsening nephropathy' and 'new or worsening nephropathy or CV death'), the risk was reduced in the 'all empagliflozin' group and the individual dose groups compared with the placebo group. There were no obvious differences between the 2 empagliflozin dose groups (Table 12). The Kaplan-Meier estimation of cumulative probability of events are shown in Figure 13 and for the composite 'new or worsening nephropathy' Figure 14. The analyses of subgroups (including by age, sex, renal function, glucose control and medication use at baseline; post hoc ) showed consistent beneficial treatment effects across all subgroups.

## UACR-related endpoints

New onset of albuminuria (UACR ≥30 mg/g) and macroalbuminuria (&gt;300 mg/g)

While the risk of new onset of macroalbuminuria (UACR&gt;300 mg/g) was reduced in the empagliflozin groups compared with the placebo group (Table 12), no significant difference between empagliflozin and placebo was observed for new onset of albuminuria (UACR ≥30 mg/g; Table 13 below).

## Reversibility of albuminuria

For patients with microalbuminuria (UACR 30 to 300 mg/g) or macro-albuminuria (UACR &gt;300 mg/g) at baseline, more patients showed sustained reversal of their proteinuria after treatment with empagliflozin than with placebo, which started shortly after trial onset and was maintained throughout the trial. There were no obvious differences between the 2 empagliflozin dose groups (Table 14 below)

## eGFR change over time

When mean eGFR values were analysed over time, there was a steady decrease in eGFR in the placebo group, indicative of natural disease progression. In contrast, the initial decreases in eGFR in the empagliflozin groups were reversible over time, with eGFR values higher in the empagliflozin groups than in the placebo group after about a year (Figure 15). About 30 days after the stop of treatment, eGFR increased from the last value on treatment by about 3.5 ml/min/1.73m 2  in the empagliflozin groups, while no change was seen in the placebo group.

## Further Efficacy endpoints

This outcome study was designed to investigate the long-term CV safety of empagliflozin. The analyses of HbA1c, FPG, body weight, SBP, and DBP considered all available data including values obtained post-treatment and after the intake of rescue medication (OC-AD), to match the analyses used for the outcome events following the ITT analysis principle.

Of note, in this trial, adjustments to concomitant medications, including those that affect glycaemic control, blood pressure, etc., could be made at the discretion of the investigator to achieve best standard of care.

Reductions in HbA1c, FPG, body weight, SBP, and DBP were seen for empagliflozin compared with placebo at Week 94 (52 for body weight), the time point corresponding to the treatment duration all patients could reach in this trial (Table 15 below). The higher dose showed better efficacy, but the differences were small.

## Ancillary analyses

## Ancillary analyses

The subgroups of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3A (defined as eGFR 45 to &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) and CKD stage 3B (30 to &lt;45 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) are described in detail because currently, empagliflozin is not recommended for use in patients with persistent eGFR &lt;45 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and the MAH   seeks authorisation for use in these patients.

The CV and nephropathy endpoints were analysed according to the eGFR categories ≥90, 60 to &lt;90, 45 to &lt;60, &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . In total 1249 patients had a baseline eGFR in the category of CKD 3A (45 to &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ). In total 570 patients had a baseline eGFR of &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , of whom 543 had 30 to &lt;45 ml/min/1.73 m 2 . Although eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m 2  at screening was an exclusion criterion, 27 patients had an eGFR value of &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m 2  at baseline, which was measured about 3 weeks after screening. These 27 patients were pooled with patients with eGFR of 30 to &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m 2  at baseline which can be considered conservative.

For the CV endpoints analysed, the treatment differences between the eGFR subgroups were small and treatment-by-subgroup interaction p-values were &gt;0.05. The hazard ratio point estimates for patients with CKD 3A or 3B were in line with subjects with better renal function.

Also for new or worsening nephropathy, no relevant treatment differences were observed between the eGFR subgroups and treatment-by-subgroup interaction p-values were &gt;0.05. The hazard ratio point estimates for patients with CKD 3A and 3B were similar to those of the overall study population

| Design           | This was a randomised, double-blind, multinational, parallel group, event driven study with 3 treatment groups. Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to empagliflozin 10 mg once daily, empagliflozin 25 mg once daily, or placebo, as add-on to standard of care treatment, including for diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. After screening, all eligible patients underwent a 2-week, open-label, placebo run-in period before randomisation. The end of study visit was to take place within ±7 days of a scheduled visit date after the last dose of study medication for patients who prematurely discontinued or at study closure for patients ongoing when the required number of outcome events was anticipated to have been reached for the trial. A final follow-up visit was planned 30 days after the end of treatment visit. Patients who discontinued or withdrew from trial medication after randomisation (Visit 3 and beyond) were to be followed up until the end of the study using the same visit schedule until the end of the trial. The observational period for a patient was from randomisation until the last visit after study closure announcement (including 30 days after the last ontreatment visit). The planned treatment duration was anticipated to be approximately 6 and 8 years (approximately 300 to 420 weeks), depending on the expected accrual period of 2 years and the assumed 3-point MACE event rate and the different times at which patients were randomised. The actual study duration depended on the first occurrence of primary outcome events; a minimum of 691 patients with adjudicated primary outcome events were required for the primary analysis. An independent external committee (Clinical Event Committee) was established to adjudicate centrally and in a blinded fashion, all fatal events and events suspected of stroke, myocardial ischaemia (incl. myocardial infarction), cardiac failure, and coronary revascularization procedures, as detailed in the CEC charter. Additionally, specified events of cancer and hepatic events were adjudicated by external independent committees.

Patients who discontinued or withdrew from trial medication after randomisation (Visit 3 and beyond) were to be followed up until the end of the study using the same visit schedule until the end of the trial. The observational period for a patient was from randomisation until the last visit after study closure announcement (including 30 days after the last ontreatment visit). The planned treatment duration was anticipated to be approximately 6 and 8 years (approximately 300 to 420 weeks), depending on the expected accrual period of 2 years and the assumed 3-point MACE event rate and the different times at which patients were randomised. The actual study duration depended on the first occurrence of primary outcome events; a minimum of 691 patients with adjudicated primary outcome events were required for the primary analysis. An independent external committee (Clinical Event Committee) was established to adjudicate centrally and in a blinded fashion, all fatal events and events suspected of stroke, myocardial ischaemia (incl. myocardial infarction), cardiac failure, and coronary revascularization procedures, as detailed in the CEC charter. Additionally, specified events of cancer and hepatic events were adjudicated by external independent committees. A project based data monitoring committee (DMC), independent of the sponsor was established to monitor patient safety across several phase IIb/III empagliflozin trials, and to advise the sponsor whether to |

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of the clinical study

EMPA-REG was a cardiovascular outcome trial in type 2 diabetes patients. The primary objective of such trial is to exclude a harmful effect on cardiovascular events and mortality. MACE-3 was the primary endpoint for the trial, which is the preferred endpoint for safety studies according to EMA guidance(Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment or prevention of diabetes mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 1)). MACE-4 was assessed as key secondary endpoint which can be accepted. The primary and key secondary endpoints were assessed for both non-inferiority and superiority.

The inclusion criteria specify a population with T2DM at especially high risk for CV events, specified by a history of at least one CV event such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral artery disease or significant coronary artery disease. Contrary to the current SmPC of Jardiance, subjects with moderate renal insufficiency (eGFR between 30 and 60 ml/min 1.73m 2 ) were fully eligible for treatment both with 10 mg and 25 mg empagliflozin OD. Patients could only be included if glycaemic control was insufficient.

The population that was actually investigated, included 41.1% subjects from Europe and 44.6% of subjects were above 65 years of age. This is considered representative for the European T2DM population with documented atherosclerotic disease. The previously excluded population with eGFR &lt; 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2 was represented by 570 (8.1%) of subjects.

The sample size estimations are considered adequate. The event rates were around 4 %/year and higher than anticipated (2%/year). This emphasizes that the patients were at very high risk indeed. Compared to the original planning, the trial was shorter and retention was higher than expected as the trial was ended (according to plan) when a sufficient number of events was observed.

Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment groups (empagliflozin 10 mg; empagliflozin 25 mg; placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomisation was stratified in a balanced ratio for HbA1c (&lt;8.5 or ≥8.5% at screening), BMI (&lt;30 or ≥30 kg/m2 at randomisation), geographical regions (North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, and Asia), and renal function at screening (normal: eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m 2 ; mild impairment: eGFR 60 to ≤89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ; moderate impairment: eGFR 30 to ≤59 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). As these factors are prognostically important, this stratification helped to ensure baseline comparability of the treatment groups. There are no concerns related to randomisation or blinding or group differences in baseline characteristics.

The type-I error was adequately preserved for the primary and key secondary endpoints (MACE-3 and MACE-4) by a hierarchical approach including both non-inferiority and superiority testing. However, the results of all other endpoints were exploratory and should be considered hypothesis-generating. According to the Points to consider on application with 1. meta-analyses; 2. one pivotal study (CPMP/EWP/2330/99), the minimum requirement for authorisation is generally one controlled study with statistically compelling and clinically relevant results and it is regulatory practice that evidence from a single pivotal trial is generally required to be stronger than the nominal level used in an application with multiple pivotal trials. In addition, internal and external validity, clinical relevance, data quality and internal consistency should be supportive. The phase-3 results submitted with the original MAA are primarily supportive for safety. While the primary endpoint and the mortality data are considered highly reliable, all endpoints besides MACE-3 and MACE-4 in EMPA-REG were exploratory and for these exploratory results the effect of chance findings is an important concern.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The primary endpoint ( 3-point MACE ) showed superiority of 'all empagliflozin' treatment to placebo. The results were similar in exploratory analyses for both empagliflozin doses. Due to the wider confidence intervals, these results were not statistically significant. The exploratory breakdown of the first event for 3-point MACE indicated that the lower frequency of 3-point MACE for empagliflozin was primarily due to the lower frequency of CV death. The results of the per protocol analysis (PPA) and sensitivity analyses were generally consistent, but in the PPA statistical significance was not reached.

Some subgroups of the primary endpoint deserve further attention:

-  The results for the subgroups age: 50-&lt;65 years and weight: 70-80 kg were inconsistent with both lower and higher subgroups. There was, however, no trend in the results across age and weight classes (Figure 5, 6).
-  The results in users of thiazolidinediones and DPP4-inhibitors showed trends in the wrong direction (HR 1.13 and 1.27 respectively for all empa, see also Figure 7). This is especially surprising as these products have been linked to cardiac failure in the past. For thiazolidinediones the mortality results were in line with the overall trial result, but for DPP-4 inhibitors the estimate of the HR for CV mortality was &gt; 1.
-  The results in Black or African American patients (n = 357; HR: 1.48) showed trends in the wrong direction.  This was driven by strokes and MI, while the effects on CV mortality and HF were apparently maintained. However, as also the trend for all-cause mortality was unfavourable, the uncertainties regarding this subgroup have been mentioned in 4.4 (SmPC).
-  The results in subjects with normal renal function (eGFR &gt; 90 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) were less favourable than the results with impaired renal function, especially on the component 'stroke' (see below).
-  The benefits in Europe and North America were smaller than in Latin America and Asia (see below).

In the end, the results in these subgroups were considered consistent with the overall trial results based on statistical considerations.

For the key secondary endpoint ( 4-point MACE ) empagliflozin (doses pooled) was non-inferior, but not superior, to placebo. The results for 10 and 25 mg were similar.

The risk of CV death and all-cause mortality was significantly reduced in the 'all empagliflozin' group and the individual dose groups compared with the placebo group. Again, there were no obvious differences between the 2 empagliflozin dose groups. The majority of all deaths were CV deaths, and non-CV death was numerically reduced in the empagliflozin groups compared with the placebo group.

Although mortality (all-cause and non-CV) was only tested in an exploratory way, the results are considered robust. Both CV-mortality and non-CV mortality favoured empagliflozin. Vital status information was available for all but 53 patients. The benefit for empagliflozin was confirmed in a sensitivity analysis assuming all empagliflozin treated-patients lost to follow up had died.

The mortality results were obtained in addition to standard of care which included blood pressure-lowering medications (used by 95% of patients at baseline), lipid-lowering medications (81%), and anticoagulants (89%, in the vast majority anti-platelets), most of which have been proven to decrease CV death. The reduction in the risk of death can be translated into a number needed to treat (NNT) of 39 to prevent 1 death in 3.1 years. There was a rapid response to empagliflozin treatment, with a lower probability of death for empagliflozin with the curves separating from placebo as early as the first month based on the Kaplan-Meier estimates. The probability of death continued to separate throughout the observation period. The magnitude of the effect is in line with that seen in the outcome trials that established the use of statins or ACEi /ARBs. (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blockers).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The positive effect of antidiabetics on macrovascular complications has until now only been demonstrated for metformin (UKPDS 34 study). This is the first time since 1998 that the efficacy of an antidiabetic medicinal product in decreasing cardiovascular events has been shown in a large clinical trial. In the case of EMPA-REG the effect on MACE-3 was largely driven by the effect on cardiovascular death. Cardiovascular mortality is the most important mortality in type 2 diabetes.

For all myocardial infarction -related endpoints, no significant difference was observed between empagliflozin and placebo, but the point estimate slightly favoured empagliflozin (non-fatal MI, HR: 0.87; 95% CI 0.70, 1.09). Silent MI, defined as single flagged ECG and not confirmed by the adjudication committee, was not part of the primary endpoint. All of these flagged ECG cases were sent to the central adjudication committee for assessing any outcome events. The outcome of unconfirmed single flagged ECG favoured placebo (HR 1.28; 95% CI 0.70, 2.33). The unconfirmed single flagged ECG defined as 'silent MI' was only assessable in a limited number of patients, as it required an ECG at baseline without major abnormalities and excluded patients with prior MI-related adjudicated outcome events. The fact that the primary endpoint was reworded regarding silent MIs raised questions as to whether this could have been a modification potentially based on unblinded data, and not a clarification as described in the study report. The MAH clarified that silent MI had never been a part of the primary endpoint and justified the reasons for this.

Although not statistically significant in the primary analysis, the hazard ratio point estimate for stroke was clearly above 1 (non-fatal stroke; HR 1.24; 95% CI 0.92, 1.67). The MAH has compared the On-treatment set (+30 days) with the Treated set and concludes that this result is driven by events during observation after treatment (23 empa, 3 placebo). In the subgroup of patients in Europe, the adverse effect was larger, is already evident in the Kaplan-Meijer curve at 180 days and even reached statistical significance (HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.26-3.29). In light of this finding, the results for other selected endpoints (as reported in the study report) in Europe were summarized (Figure 17). This shows that the results for MACE-3 and all its components, and also, MACE-4 in Europe (and North America) are less favourable than the overall trial results. No plausible explanation for the findings in Europe was found, which may be attributable to chance. In general, the excess of strokes during treatment with empagliflozin (if not chance) may be partly related to the decrease of circulating blood volume, which can be seen as an increased haematocrit in the empagliflozin treated groups. This latter finding has been described in 4.8 (SmPC).

Apparently, the mortality benefits are not explained by a risk reduction for atherosclerotic events. Instead, the MAH suggests that a reduction of heart failure related events may be one of the factors driving the benefit. The most prevalent categorisation of the CV deaths were 'other CV death', including fatal events deemed not assessable by the CEC (129 of 309 patients with CV death), followed by sudden deaths (91) and worsening of heart failure (30). This pattern could indeed be compatible with mortality from heart failure.

Heart failure is highly prevalent in patients with diabetes (e.g. 22% of those aged ≥65 years) and associated with increased mortality (in the referenced study a 5-year survival rate of only 12.5%) [Bertoni AG, Diabetes Care 2004]. Heart failure related endpoints were predefined (but exploratory) in the EMPA-REG study. For all heart failure endpoints, the risk was reduced in the 'all empagliflozin' group and the individual dose groups compared with the placebo group (Hospitalisation for heart failure: HR: 0.65).

The exploratory composite nephropathy endpoint 'new or worsening nephropathy' was reduced for both empa doses (HR all empa: 0.61 ). This was primarily driven by 'New onset of macroalbuminuria (UACR &gt;300 mg/g)'. No obvious difference between empagliflozin and placebo was observed for new onset of albuminuria (HR 0.95 ).

For patients with microalbuminuria (UACR 30 to 300 mg/g) or macro-albuminuria (UACR &gt;300 mg/g) at baseline, more patients showed sustained reversal of their proteinuria after treatment with empagliflozin than with placebo (patients with improvement, HR &gt; 1 favours empa: microalbuminuria HR 1.43 ; macroalbuminuria: HR 1.82 ). There were no obvious differences between the 2 empagliflozin dose groups. These results are maintained in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All patients had cardiovascular disorders, and it seems obvious that this patient population had also nefrangioscleroses. Moreover, most patients in this trail were already diagnosed with a renal insufficiency. Although the incidence rates for decreased renal function were lower in the empagliflozin group, the microvascular endpoint 'nephropathy' should be taken with special consideration, since:

-  19,5% of the included patients were diagnosed with a 'diabetic nephropathy', and were equally divided in different groups. Since however the diagnosis of nephropathy was based on the measurement of eGFR and not based on a pathological diagnosis due to a renal biopsy, the distinction between a diabetic nephropathy and an ischemic nephropathy due to cardiovascular diseases could not be made. Moreover, in practice only a subset of patients with diabetes type II have typical diabetes glomerulopathy in biopsies. Therefore it is not sure how many patients indeed had a diabetic nephropathy in this study population
-  Microalbuminuria is a common feature of aging and can be associated with a large number of acute and chronic inflammatory as well as vascular pathologies. Furthermore, microalbuminuria is often transient and reversible. Therefore, the adverse event of albuminuria should be taken with some reservation, albuminuria is not a specific parameter for renal insufficiency.

When mean eGFR values were analysed over time, there was a steady decrease in eGFR in the placebo group, indicative of natural disease progression. In contrast, the initial decreases in eGFR in the empagliflozin groups were reversible over time, with eGFR values higher in the empagliflozin groups than in the placebo group after about a year. About 30 days after the stop of treatment, eGFR increased from the last value on treatment by about 3.5 ml/min/1.73m 2  in the empagliflozin groups, while no change was seen in the placebo group. These data suggest that the initial decrease seen with empagliflozin treatment is haemodynamic in nature.

Taken together, prevention of new albuminuria, reversal of existing albuminuria and prevention of the usual decline of eGFR in type 2 diabetes patients all suggest that empagliflozin may be important in the prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy. This result was an exploratory finding in EMPA-REG and requires further confirmation. Many questions are still open, e.g. the development of eGFR in subjects with impaired renal function and how these potential benefits interact with other medicinal products, either usually beneficial (ACE-inhibitors) or detrimental (NSAIDs).

The underlying nephro-protective mechanism of empagliflozin is not clear but may at least partly be due to the attenuation of renal hyperfiltration via tubulo-glomerular feedback mechanisms [Skrtic M, Diabetologia, 2014; Cherney DZI, Circulation, 2013]. Renal hyperfiltration results in increased glomerular pressure and can lead to albuminuria, renal function decline, and renal impairment. Altered hemodynamics may also explain the improvement seen in the occurrence of heart failure and either directly or indirectly contribute to the improvement of cardiovascular mortality.

In EMPA-REG, patients could be included with any eGFR &gt; 30 ml/min/1.73m 2  and they were eligible for both dose levels of empagliflozin. The MAH proposes to lift the restriction for use in patients with moderate renal insufficiency based on these results.

Based on the analysis of MACE-3, all-cause and CV mortality, it can be agreed that the results for moderate renal insufficiency are in line with the overall trial results. Exploratory results for heart failure requiring hospitalisation and new or worsening nephropathy suggest that the efficacy is at least maintained with worsening renal function.

Efficacy for glycaemic control in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency was similar to previous results. In these patients, no clinically relevant effect on glycaemic control has been shown. Although empagliflozin has shown beneficial CV effects in these patients, the inclusion in SmPC section 4.2  (as proposed by the applicant) of patients with eGFR below 45 ml/min/1.73m 2   was not supported by the CHMP, as glycaemic

efficacy is considered essential for any diabetes product. Therefore, the posology in patients with renal impairment should remain unchanged.

The efficacy data for both dose levels tested were highly comparable for the primary and secondary endpoints. There were slight advantages for the higher dose in parameters like, HbA1c, FPG, blood pressure and weight; only in subjects with eGFR &gt;60 ml/min/1.73m 2 . For the proposed CV prevention indication, the higher dose has no advantages.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

EMPA-REG was a well-designed and well-conducted trial. The trial showed superiority of empagliflozin to placebo on the primary outcome MACE-3, which was driven by benefits on CV mortality; effect shown on all-cause mortality was consistent. Exploratory results suggest that prevention of heart failure and less worsening nephropathy may explain the findings. However, for an application based on a single pivotal trial, the inconsistent additional endpoints (stroke, silent MI) and inconsistent subgroups (especially Europe) raise concerns. The included population was at especially high cardiovascular risk. Therefore, the results cannot be directly extrapolated to the entire diabetic population.

In the population with eGFR between 30 and 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 , in which empagliflozin is currently not recommended, the benefits seem maintained.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

In phase 3, the overall incidence of adverse events in patients treated with empagliflozin was similar to placebo. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was hypoglycaemia when used with sulphonylurea or insulin. Increased urination and volume depletion are directly related to the mode of action. Genital and urinary tract infections are common.

Although CV and microvascular outcome events are defined as safety endpoints in the trial protocol, their analyses are described in the efficacy section in this document

## Patient exposure

The median observation period was about 3.1 years for each treatment group. The total observation time per treatment group was at least 6794 years (Table 17). The total exposure to treatment per group was at least 5747 years (Table 18).

## Adverse events

The incidence rates for any AE and for SAEs (and fatal SAEs) were lower for patients treated with empagliflozin than placebo. The incidence rates for drug-related AEs as defined by the investigator were higher for patients treated with empagliflozin than placebo. For other categories of AEs, including those leading to discontinuation of study medication, there was no marked imbalance between the 3 treatment groups (Table 19 below).

## Most frequently reported Adverse Events

Of the most frequently reported AEs at PT level, similar rates across the 3 treatment arms were reported for urinary tract infection and hypoglycaemia. Lower incidence rates for hyperglycaemia were reported for patients treated with empagliflozin (10 mg: 3.86/100 patient-years; 25 mg: 3.55/100 pt-yrs) compared with placebo (8.51/100 pt-yrs). Of the less frequently reported AEs, imbalances in incidence rates between empagliflozin and placebo groups were observed for PTs associated with genital infections, or with other AEs known to occur with empagliflozin (such as dysuria, pollakisuria, and polyuria). The rate for PT thirst was higher in the empagliflozin groups (10 mg: 0.12/100 pt-yrs; 25 mg: 0.32/100 pt-yrs) than placebo (0.09/100 pt-yrs). Urinary tract infections were reported slightly more frequently in the placebo group, but lead to discontinuation more among empagliflozin users (Table 20).

The most frequently reported AEs leading to treatment discontinuation at the PT level were myocardial infarction and acute myocardial infarction, with similar rates in all treatment groups.

The overall incidence rates of AEs assessed as drug-related by the investigators were higher for both empagliflozin groups than the placebo group. This was largely due to higher incidence rates for AEs in the SOCs reproductive system and breast disorders, renal and urinary disorders, and investigations. At the PT level, slight imbalances in incidence rates between the empagliflozin and placebo groups followed the differences in the SOCs, with higher incidence rates for the empagliflozin groups compared with placebo observed, for example, for balanoposthitis, vulvovaginal pruritus, genital pruritus, decreased weight, pollakisuria, and polyuria.

The most frequently reported AEs with severe intensity were in the SOCs cardiac disorders and infections and infestations. The frequency of severe cardiac disorders was slightly lower for patients treated with empagliflozin (10 mg: 6.9%; 25 mg: 7.3%) than placebo (9.4%). The frequencies of severe events at the PT level within the SOC cardiac disorders were generally slightly lower for the empagliflozin groups than for placebo. For infections and infestations, the most frequently reported PT, pneumonia, was reported at a slightly lower frequency for patients in the empagliflozin groups than placebo. With regard to severe nervous system disorders, the frequency of ischaemic stroke was slightly lower for the empagliflozin groups (10 mg: 0.4%; 25 mg: 0.2%) than placebo (0.6%) while the frequency of cerebrovascular accident was slightly higher for the empagliflozin groups (10 mg: 0.8%; 25 mg: 0.9%) than placebo (0.5%).

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

The overall incidence rates for fatal AEs were lower for patients treated with empagliflozin than for patients treated with placebo (Table 19). At the PT level, the most frequently reported fatal AEs were myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest, acute myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure were less frequently reported for patients treated with empagliflozin than placebo. Incidence rates for the other most frequently reported PTs (≥0.2% in any group) were generally similar between the empagliflozin and placebo treatment groups or slightly lower for empagliflozin than placebo. As for most of the AE analyses in this trial, the fatal AE analyses were based on a follow-up period of 7 days after treatment stop, and therefore the numbers of patients with fatal AEs differ from the numbers for all-cause mortality (for which the follow-up was until individual trial end). Nonetheless, the reduction in deaths in the empagliflozin groups is seen in both analyses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incidence rates of SAEs (which included fatal and non-fatal SAEs) were slightly lower for patients treated with empagliflozin than for patients treated with placebo (Table 19), largely due to lower incidence rates of serious cardiac disorders in the empagliflozin groups than in the placebo group. At the PT level, a number of SAEs had slightly lower incidence rates for patients on empagliflozin than on placebo (angina unstable, cardiac failure, coronary artery disease, cardiac failure congestive, myocardial ischaemia, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, pneumonia). Other PTs had slightly higher incidence rates for patients on empagliflozin than for patients on placebo (urosepsis, cerebrovascular accident).

The overall incidence rates for SAEs that were immediately life-threatening were slightly higher in the empagliflozin groups than in the placebo group, largely due to the higher incidence rates of cardiac disorders that were immediately life-threatening (empagliflozin 10 mg: 0.47/100 pt-yrs; empagliflozin 25 mg: 0.57/100 pt-yrs; placebo: 0.40/100 pt-yrs). However, the incidence rates for combined fatal or immediately-life-threatening SAEs, overall and for the SOC cardiac disorders, were lower for both empagliflozin groups (overall 10 mg: 2.35/100 pt-yrs; 25 mg: 2.21/100 pt-yrs) than for the placebo group (2.68/100 pt-yrs).

## Adverse Events of special interest

An adverse event of special interest (serious or non-serious) was an AE of scientific, medical, or regulatory concern. A total of 11 categories of adverse events of special interest were analysed in this trial (Table 20).

The incidence rates of genital infections were higher in the empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg groups than in the placebo group. Although non-serious urinary tract infections were similar among all groups, serious or complicated UTIs occurred more with the 25 mg dose, but not with the 10 mg dose.

Although the incidence rate of hepatic injury was slightly lower in both empagliflozin groups than the placebo group, there were slightly more serious cases.

Five patients in total were reported with diabetic ketoacidosis (placebo: 1, empa 10mg: 3, empa 25mg: 1). The frequencies of confirmed hypoglycaemic adverse events were comparable in all groups, including frequencies for events where the patient required assistance.

Bone fractures occurred more frequently in the placebo group compared to the empagliflozin groups.

The overall frequencies and incidence rates for malignancy up to trial termination were somewhat higher for the empagliflozin-treated groups; the same was true for patients with malignancy with an onset after 6 months of exposure to study medication (Table 20).

## Laboratory findings

There were increases in total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol in all treatment groups from baseline to Week 28. Thereafter, values continued to increase slightly until Week 80. The increase was greater in the empagliflozin 25 mg group than in the empagliflozin 10 mg group, and increases were greater in both empagliflozin groups than in the placebo group. There were also increases in Haemotocrit in the Empa groups versus placebo.

## Safety in special populations

AEs in patients with CKD 3A/B were similar between treatment groups although higher than in 'all patients'. For most SOCs, events for placebo were numerically higher (Table 21).

The incidence of AEs and SAEs increases with age, but similarly in placebo and empagliflozin-treated groups. No new risks are identified for elderly patients who use empagliflozin (Table 22).

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety profile of empagliflozin in trial 1245.25 is consistent with the known safety profile of empagliflozin. Only thirst is proposed by the MAH as a new side effect after their assessment of all available clinical data and in light of the new data from trial 1245.25. Thirst was not included in the definition of volume depletion as used by the MAH and therefore evaluated separately. In the pooling of all placebo-controlled trials with a treatment duration of 18 to 24 weeks (not including 1245.25), which was designated for side-effects labelling, the PT thirst was reported for 1.3% of the patients in either empagliflozin group (10 mg or 25 mg), while not reported in the placebo group. These data are consistent with the results from the largest safety pooling supporting the initial marketing application and from trial 1245.25 (empagliflozin 10 mg: 0.3%; 25 mg: 0.8%; placebo: 0.2%). The addition of thirst is therefore agreed. Besides, elderly patients, who are often exposed to multi drug treatments, including diuretics and ACE-inhibitors are vulnerable for volume depletion. Therefore, a special warning should be added in section 4.4 of the SmPC

The new data about AEs that were collected are in line with previous knowledge about empagliflozin as documented in the SmPC. This also applies to the AEs of special interest. Although this was a large trial, the numbers of rare events are still too low to draw definite conclusions. Of note:

-  Hepatic events were carefully assessed by a blinded committee. Although infrequent, serious hepatic injury and/or patients with ALT/AST ≥5x ULN were higher for patients in the empagliflozin groups (increased AST/ALT: 10 mg: 0.7%; 25 mg: 0.6%) than placebo (0.3%). No definite cases of DILI were identified as according to the committee confounding factors were present.
-  In total, 7 patients (0.3%) in the empagliflozin 10 mg group and 12 patients (0.5%) in the empagliflozin 25 mg group had PT urosepsis or sepsis possibly originated from the urinary tract, compared with 5 patients (0.2%) in the placebo group. However, the overall incidence rate of (complicated) UTIs was similar in the empagliflozin groups and the placebo group. The text regarding UTI in Section 4.4 of the SmPC is still acceptable.
-  The frequency of confirmed hypoglycaemic adverse events was similar in all treatment groups within each subgroup (e.g. by age, renal impairment, use of insulin at baseline), except for the subgroup with SU at baseline. It is somewhat surprising that concomitant use of SUs is associated with less hypoglycaemias (with SU: 24.5% for empagliflozin 10 mg, 25.0% for empagliflozin 25 mg, 23.4% for placebo; without SU: 30.5 % for empagliflozin 10 mg, 29.7 % for empagliflozin 25 mg, 31.2 % for placebo).
-  Use of loop diuretics was associated with a higher risk of volume depletion in the empagliflozin groups (10 mg: 4.92/100 pt-yrs; 25 mg: 4.45/100 pt-yrs) than in the placebo group (3.69/100 pt-yrs). This association is already mentioned in section 4.5 of the SmPC.
-  There was no clear increase in the incidence of keto-acidosis.
-  Malignancies occurred more frequently with empagliflozin treatment (4.3%) compared to placebo treatment (3.3%), also when taking into account only cases after at least 6 months of exposure. However, no specific group of malignancies seems to explain this and after detailed classification the groups become very small.

The MAH summarised AE data for subjects with moderate renal insufficiency and for older patients. Although in these groups the overall rate of AEs is higher than in the overall population, the AE profile is comparable to the total population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The following additional laboratory value changes should be added to the Jardiance SmPC because these safety issues are now confirmed in empa-reg and other trials with FDC:

-  Increase in haematocrit should be added to sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.
-  Increase in serum lipids should be added to section 4.8 of the SmPC.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The established safety profile, as described in the SmPC is confirmed. Thirst can be added as a common adverse reaction. The SmPC should be extended with information on the increase in haematocrit (section 4.4 and section 4.8) and serum lipids (section 4.8).

The safety profile in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency who use empagliflozin is comparable to placebo, although the AE rates are higher than in subjects with normal renal function.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP):

The PRAC considered that the Risk Management Plan version 10.3 is acceptable.

The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu.

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 10.3 with the following content:

In addition, sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 of the SmPC have been updated with additional safety information pertaining to elevated haematocrit, volume depletion, thirst, serum lipids increased.

For detailed information on the changes to the PI, please refer to attachment 1.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

Jardiance is currently indicated to improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes. In this type 2 variation, and based on the results of the EMPA-REG cardiovascular outcome trial, the MAH initially sought an additional indication for prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of

-  all-cause mortality by reducing cardiovascular death and
-  cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Also, the MAH sought to expand recommended use in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency (eGFR 30-60 ml/min/1.73m 2 ).

During the CHMP assessment, the MAH limited the claim for additional indication to patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death.

Also during the assessment, use in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency was sought for the claim with regard to reduction of cardiovascular death only, but not for the glycaemic control part of the proposed indication.

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The EMPA-REG cardiovascular outcome trial included 7028 diabetic patients with established cardiovascular disease (high cardiovascular risk defined as at least one of the following risk factors: myocardial infarction or CVA within 2 months before inclusion, coronary heart disease, instable angina pectoris, peripheral arterial disease) who were randomised between placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg OD and empagliflozin 25 mg OD. Patients were followed up for a median of 3.1 years. The trial was stopped according to plan after 691 events had been observed.

The primary endpoint ( 3-point MACE ) was the time to first occurrence of CV death (including fatal stroke and fatal MI), non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. The primary analysis [based on the treated set population] showed superiority of 'all empagliflozin' treatment to placebo. Patients with events were 282/2333 (12.1%) for placebo and 490/4687 (10.5%) for all empagliflozin treated patients. The HR was 0.86 (95.02% CI: 0.74, 0.99; p (2-sided) = 0.0382). The results were similar (although not statistically significant) in exploratory analyses for both empagliflozin doses (patients with events 10 mg: 243/2345 (10.4%), 25mg: 247/2342 (10.5%)).

The exploratory breakdown of the first event for 3-point MACE indicated that the lower frequency of 3-point MACE for empagliflozin was primarily driven by a lower frequency of CV death (placebo: 107 (4.6%), all empa: 143 (3.1%); HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.49, 0.77). The most prevalent categorisation of the CV deaths was 'other CV death', including fatal events deemed not assessable by the CEC (129 of 309 patients with CV death), followed by sudden deaths (91) and worsening of heart failure (30). For all myocardial infarction -related endpoints, no significant difference was observed between empagliflozin and placebo, although the point estimate favoured empagliflozin (non-fatal MI, HR: 0.87; 95% CI 0.70, 1.09). Silent MI was not part of the primary endpoint, but the outcome favoured placebo (HR 1.28; 95% CI 0.70, 2.33). However, the hazard ratio point estimate for stroke was above 1 (non-fatal stroke; HR 1.24; 95% CI 0.92, 1.67; not statistically significant). In Europe, the HR for stroke was statistically significant (HR 2.04, CI: 1.26, 3.29).

The key secondary endpoint ( 4-point MACE ) was the time to first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalisation for unstable angina pectoris. Empagliflozin (doses pooled) was non-inferior, but not superior, to placebo based on this endpoint (HR 0.89 (95.02% CI 0.78, 1.01); p = 0.0795). The results for 10 and 25 mg were similar.

The risk of CV death and all-cause mortality was significantly reduced in the 'all empagliflozin' group and the individual dose groups compared with the placebo group (all-cause mortality: placebo: 194 (8.3%), empa: 269 (5.7%)). There were no obvious differences between the two empagliflozin dose groups. The majority of all deaths were CV deaths, and non-CV death was numerically reduced in the empagliflozin

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

groups compared with the placebo group. The result was confirmed in a sensitivity analysis assuming all empagliflozin-treated-patients lost to follow up had died.

The efficacy data for both dose levels tested were highly comparable for the primary and secondary endpoints. There were slight advantages for the higher dose in parameters like HbA1c, FPG, blood pressure and weight.

Results in this trial confirmed previous data for glycaemic control in subjects with moderate renal impairment.

Additional data were obtained with regard to pharmacokinetic through levels reflecting on exposure. These data confirm the PK information in the current SmPC.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Heart failure related endpoints were exploratory by design in this trial. For all heart failure endpoints, the risk was reduced in the 'all empagliflozin' group and the individual dose groups compared with the placebo group (Patients with events of hospitalisation for heart failure: Placebo 4.1%, All empa 2.7%; HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.85).

The exploratory composite nephropathy endpoint 'new or worsening nephropathy' was reduced for both empa doses (HR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.70). This was primarily driven by 'new onset of macro-albuminuria'. However, no obvious difference between empagliflozin and placebo was observed for new onset of albuminuria.

For patients with microalbuminuria (UACR 30 to 300 mg/g) or macro-albuminuria (UACR &gt;300 mg/g) at baseline, more patients showed sustained reversal of their proteinuria after treatment with empagliflozin than with placebo. There were no obvious differences between the 2 empagliflozin dose groups. These results were maintained in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency.

When mean eGFR values were analysed over time, there was a steady decrease in eGFR in the placebo group, indicative of natural disease progression. In contrast, the initial decreases in eGFR in the empagliflozin groups were reversible over time, with eGFR values higher in the empagliflozin groups than in the placebo group after about a year. About 30 days after the stop of treatment, eGFR increased from the last value on treatment by about 3.5 ml/min/1.73m 2  in the empagliflozin groups, while no change was seen in the placebo group.

Although most subgroups with regard to the primary endpoint were consistent with the main analysis, there were some exceptions. In the analysis of Black or African American patients, the HR for MACE-3 favoured placebo (HR: 1.48). The results in users of thiazolidinediones and also DPP4-inhibitors showed trends in the wrong direction (HR 1.13 and 1.27). In these same subgroups, the HRs for CV mortality were 0.77, 0.60 and 1.23 respectively. In Black or African American patients, the HR for all-cause mortality was 1.25.

The benefits in Europe and also North America were smaller than in Latin America and Asia. The HR for MACE-3 in Europe (41.1% of the patients) was 0.97 for the 10 mg dose and 1.07 for the 25 mg dose, for North America (19.9% of the patients) this was 0.78 and 1.01 respectively.

The results for MACE-3 in subjects with normal renal function (eGFR &gt; 90 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) were also slightly less favourable than the results in subjects with impaired renal function.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The safety profile of empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG trial was consistent with the known safety profile of empagliflozin. The overall incidence of adverse events in patients treated with empagliflozin was similar to placebo. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was hypoglycaemia when empagliflozin was used

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with sulphonylurea or insulin. Increased urination and volume depletion are directly related to the mode of action. There was no clear increase in the occurrence of keto-acidosis (placebo: 1, empa 10 mg: 3, empa 25mg: 1). In EMPA-REG, thirst occurred more frequently with empagliflozin than with placebo (empagliflozin 10 mg: 0.3%; 25 mg: 0.8%; placebo: 0.2%). This ADR is not completely covered by the potentially related entity of 'volume depletion', and has thus been added to SmPC section 4.8.

The MAH summarised AE data for subjects with moderate renal insufficiency and for older patients. Although in these groups the overall rate of AEs is higher than in the overall population, the AE profile is comparable to the total population. EMPA-REG confirmed increases in haematocrit and serum lipids.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

For some rare AEs of special interest, the numbers of events were low despite the size of the trial. Of note:

-  Serious hepatic injury and/or patients with ALT/AST ≥5x ULN were higher for patients in the empagliflozin groups (increased AST/ALT: 10 mg: 0.7%; 25 mg: 0.6%) than placebo (0.3%). No definite cases of DILI were identified as according to the hepatic events committee confounding factors were present.
-  In total, 7 patients (0.3%) in the empagliflozin 10 mg group and 12 patients (0.5%) in the empagliflozin 25 mg group had PT urosepsis or sepsis possibly originated from the urinary tract, compared with 5 patients (0.2%) in the placebo group. The overall incidence rate of (complicated) UTIs was similar in the empagliflozin groups and the placebo group.
-  Malignancies occurred more frequently with empagliflozin treatment (4.3%) compared to placebo treatment (3.3%), also when taking into account only cases after at least 6 months of exposure. However, no specific group of malignancies seems to explain this and after detailed classification the groups become very small.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The EMPA-REG trial is a large, well-designed and well-conducted cardiovascular outcome trial. There are no major concerns related to group differences in baseline characteristics. The trial demonstrated superiority (p=0.04) of empagliflozin over placebo on the primary endpoint of MACE-3. When analysed by the individual components, this result is driven primarily by a benefit in CV death, starting to be significant as early as day 59. The components non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke showed statistically non-significant, heterogeneous differences, with a positive trend for non-fatal MI and a negative trend for stroke. The reduction in CV mortality appears largely independent of HbA1c and change from baseline in HbA1c, being even observed in subjects with baseline HbA1c &lt; 7, and with similar results obtained for subjects with a reduction in HbA1c &lt;0.3% or even an increase as compared to subjects with a decrease &gt;0.3%. This separation of glucose lowering effect and reduction in CV mortality was confirmed by additional analyses and may suggest a different mode of action.

All-cause mortality in these patients is mainly attributable to CV causes, but also non-CV causes favoured empagliflozin (although not statistically significant). This positive effect of antidiabetics on macrovascular complications had previously only been demonstrated for metformin (UKPDS 34 study). This was the first time since 1998 that efficacy of an antidiabetic drug was demonstrated in decreasing cardiovascular events in a large clinical trial. The effect size for the reduction in the risk of death expressed as the number needed to treat (NNT) was 39 to prevent 1 death in 3.1 years and is considered clinically relevant. Results are considered reliable as follow-up information for vital status was almost complete (&gt;99%, only 53 patients missing) and the parameter is free from bias.

This type 2 variation is based on the results of a single, but large pivotal clinical trial. The primary and key secondary endpoints were assessed for non-inferiority and superiority. These tests were defined in a hierarchical testing procedure. All other outcomes of the trial are considered exploratory, but show supportive results. This applies in particular to the heart failure and nephropathy related outcomes where significant and potentially clinically relevant results were observed.

The results for stroke remain unexplained. This result was significant in the European population, leading to a neutral HR for the primary endpoint of MACE-3 in Europe (see Figure 17). However, trends were different for North and South America, and overall the HR was non-significant. With regards to the overall trial population, the MAH has provided data to show that part of the effect on stroke can be attributed to off-treatment events occurring late in the trial. There was no evidence of an association between stroke and volume depletion adverse events that occurred prior to a stroke nor with haemo-concentration. A similar trend is not seen for transient cerebral ischaemia (TIA). Also, no relevant difference in baseline characteristics was identified that could be related to such regional differences.

Many subjects were included in the study with an eGFR between 30 and 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 . The results are largely in line with the overall trial population. The established mode of action, related to glycaemic control, does seem not to confer the mortality benefits. In this group of patients, the CV prevention effect has been shown, but the effect on glycaemic control is limited.

The safety profile confirms prior knowledge, no unexpected adverse effects occurred. As usual for this class of products, genital infections were more frequent among empagliflozin users. Urinary tract infections were balanced between groups. Bone fractures were not more frequent in empagliflozin treated patients. Ketoacidosis occurred in only 5 cases with only a numerical increase in the 10 mg group (3 vs. 1 in the other groups). Malignancies occurred slightly more frequently in the empagliflozin-treated groups, but no specific malignancy was noticeable after classification, the numbers were too small.

## Benefit-risk balance

The overall benefit in terms of reduction in cardiovascular deaths by treating DM patients with a history of a cardiovascular event with empagliflozin is considered clinically relevant and outweighs the risks. The small increase in non-ischemic stroke remains an uncertainty, but could be due to chance. The question is whether the over-all improved CV outcome justifies a new indication. This will be discussed further below.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

Results of EMPA-REG indicate that the subgroup of T2DM patients with established CV disease may benefit in terms of cardiovascular outcome. The issue discussed as part of this CHMP assessment was whether these patients and their goals of treatment should be mentioned in section 4.1.

The indication proposed by the MAH was defining two T2DM populations, one large (T2DM) and one more restricted (patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease), aiming at two different goals of treatment (glycaemic control and reduction of cardiovascular death). Important in this regard is the view that the cardiovascular benefit appears to be not only explained by the glucose lowering effect of empagliflozin. The MAH supported this by arguments such as the time course of the effect observed with an early benefit, the independence of the size of the glucose lowering effects and the beneficial effects in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 where the glucose lowering effects are marginal. It is therefore unlikely that the effect is only based on an effect on atherosclerosis, glycaemia control or blood pressure. However, the exact mechanism of action remains speculative. Renal effects may play a role but further studies are needed to unravel the underlying mechanism(s) and to confirm these beneficial effects.

Apart from the mechanism of action, the MAH gave other arguments to separate glycaemic control and the reduction in cardiovascular mortality in the indication. Mentioning results only in section 5.1 would not be clear for the prescriber for whom sections 4.1 and 4.2 are more important. The posology proposed is different, as the 25 mg dose has no additional advantages (compared to the 10 mg dose) for CV prevention. In modern CV outcome trials investigating three different DPP-4 inhibitors and two GLP-1 analogues, modest differences in glucose control did not translate to improved CV outcomes, with the exception of the LEADER trial with liraglutide that was recently published (N Engl J Med 2016; 375:311-322). Finally, there are also precedents with other risk reducing therapies, such as the statins and ACE-inhibitors where a distinction in goals of treatment has been made in the indication between the metabolic/haemodynamic endpoint and the clinical outcome.

An oral explanation was held by the applicant presenting the rationale for their proposed indication (discussed above). The CHMP concluded that while EMPA REG is a positive cardiovascular outcome trial, treatment of T2DM may cover treatment and/or prevention of many co-morbidities. CHMP is of the view that in the indication section of the SmPC the patient population eligible for treatment with empagliflozin should be mentioned, i.e. patients with T2DM, without mentioning any goal of treatment, i.e. neither improvement of glycaemic control, nor reduction of the risk of cardiovascular death. This means that the wording of the indication will refer to the patient population for whom treatment with empagliflozin is intended, i.e. patients with T2DM, and the information on the EMPA-REG study including the heterogeneity of the MACE-3 endpoint, will be included in section 5.1. The rationale for CHMPs decision is that the improvement in glucose control and reduction of cardiovascular events are the main goals of treatment for T2DM and should not be separated. These have now been demonstrated in the EMPA-REG trial for patients with established CV disease and may also apply to other T2DM patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In line with the Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics with regard to wording of the indication(s), the CHMP was of the view that the population studied in the EMPA-REG i.e. T2DM patients with established CV disease, is a sub-population of the already approved T2DM population for Jardiance and that the demonstrated effect of reduction of CV mortality is covered by the general indication 'treatment of type 2 diabetes'; similarly, achievement of glycemic control is covered. Thus, the effect on CV mortality does not constitute a separate (prevention) indication. Therefore CHMP did not grant a separate CV prevention indication but deleted the endpoint 'glycaemic control' from section 4.1 to clarify that the treatment goal for empagliflozin is not limited to glycaemic control. The results of the EMPA-REG are reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

Furthermore, in the case of the current empagliflozin application based on a single pivotal trial some further considerations were: 1) EMPA-REG was primarily a safety study and the primary endpoint resulted in a p for superiority of only 0.04, 2) patients with established cardiovascular disease are only a subgroup of the total (T2DM) population with overlap between the two indications claimed, 3) the effect on the MACE-3 endpoint was inconsistent with an increase in stroke, and 4) the pharmacological principle is new and the mode of action for the latter effect has not been established.

CHMP also reflected whether to delete the restriction of the indication to patients for whom use of metformin is considered inappropriate and to grant a broad indication of monotherapy and combination therapy in patients with T2DM. The main reason for this restriction has been that only metformin had demonstrated a CV benefit in T2DM, but now this also applies to empagliflozin where 20% of the patients in the EMPA-REG study did not receive metformin and showed an even higher benefit. CHMP finally decided that it is too early for this decision, especially as the safety profile of empagliflozin is not completely mature yet.

A final issue discussed was the inclusion (as proposed by the applicant) of patients with eGFR below 45 ml/min/1.73m 2 . In these patients, no clinically relevant effect on glycaemic control has been shown but CV events may be prevented. This extension was not granted, as the CHMP considered glycaemic efficacy is essential for any diabetes product. Therefore, the posology in patients with renal impairment remained unchanged.

The final wording for the modified indication in SmPC section 4.1 as agreed by the CHMP is as follows (new text shown in bold; removed text as strikethrough):

'Jardiance is indicated for in the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control in adults as :

## Monotherapy

When an adjunct to diet and exercise

- as monotherapy when alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom use of metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance

Add-on combination therapy

·   In combination with in addition to other glucose-lowering medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes including insulin, when these, together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control

(For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available data on different combinations).'
