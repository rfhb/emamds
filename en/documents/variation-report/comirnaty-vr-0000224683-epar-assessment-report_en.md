## 1. Background information on the procedure

Pursuant to Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 31 July 2024 an application for group of variations.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation(s) requested   | Variation(s) requested                                                                                                                                      | Type              |

A grouped application comprised of 3 Type II Variations as follows:

C.I.4: Update of sections 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update pregnancy related information based on final results from interventional study C4591015, listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. Study C4591015 is a phase 2/3, placebo controlled, randomised, observer-blinded study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidate (BNT162b2) against COVID-19 in healthy pregnant women 18 years of age and older. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

C.I.4: Update of sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update information for immunocompromised individuals based on final results from interventional study C4591024, listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. Study C4591024 is a phase 2b, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of vaccine candidate BNT162b2 in immunocompromised participants ≥2 years of age. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

C.I.13: Submission of the C4591030 (secondary BNT162b2 immunogenicity endpoint analysis) supplementary (post-final) clinical study report. This is a phase 3, randomised, observer-blind trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 when co-administered with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV) in adults 18 through 64 years of age.  In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI.

The requested variation(s) proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

Within this type II variation, the MAH wishes to update the SmPC to describe the safety and immunogenicity of the Comirnaty Original while administrated to pregnant women (study C4591015) and to immunocompromised population from 2 years old and above (study C4591024). Also, MAH submitted the final neutralising antibody data when Comirnaty Original was administrated simultaneously with seasonal inactive influenza vaccine (SIIV).

## C4591015

The study C4591015 was a global Phase 2/3, randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of Comirnaty Original (30 µg) versus placebo (saline) administered in 2 doses, 21 days apart, in approximately 350 healthy pregnant women 18 years of age or older vaccinated at 24 to 34 weeks' gestation. Participants were randomised 1:1. Enrolment in this study was terminated due to enrolment challenges as a result of universal recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination of pregnant women and the increased global availability of COVID-19 vaccines.

## Efficacy

The primary immunogenicity objective was to compare neutralising antibody titres 1 months post-dose 2 in pregnant women compared to the historical control, which consisted of age matched non-pregnant women from study C4591001. The secondary objectives were to investigate vaccine efficacy (VE), describe antibody levels of mothers and their infants at different time points, up to delivery and 6 months post-delivery.

All study arms had about 110 individuals in each. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) analysis of neutralising antibodies was descriptive, but the data showed, that antibody level was higher among nonpregnant women, especially when those without earlier SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared. This is expected results and in agreement with earlier data. Section 5.1 of SmPC was updated to include a short text regarding the study design with reference to pregnant participants lower geometric mean titres (GMT) and GMR compared to non-pregnant women from historical control group.

About 110 infants born for both vaccinated and placebo arms mothers were evaluated for S-protein binding antibodies. No neutralisation assay was performed for serum from infant participants. Considering the binding and neutralising antibodies have demonstrated good agreement, this is acceptable. At the delivery, there was high level of S-protein binding antibodies in infants. This is a sign of a successful antibody transfer through placenta, which is expected results and in agreement with data from other vaccines.

## Safety

The safety database constitutes of pregnant women were randomised to receive either 30 μg of Comirnaty Original (BNT162b2, n=174) or placebo (n=174) administered in 2 doses, 21 days apart at 24 to 34 weeks' gestation and their infants. The study was limited in size due to the national recommended COVID-19 vaccination of pregnant women.

The reactogenicity profile was in line with previous results from non-pregnant adult individuals. The reactions were transient and most of them were mild to moderate at intensity. The most reported local reaction was pain at injection site (83% dose 1; 75% dose 2). The most frequently reported systemic events were fatigue (50%) and headache (34-41%). Fever was reported in 1-4% (dose 1 and 2 respectively). Most reported adverse events (AEs) were related to reactogenicity. The frequency of participants reporting any serious adverse event (SAE) was low and comparable to what was reported in the placebo group (5.6% and 5.5%, respectively). Two related AEs were reported among the pregnant participants receiving BNT162b2 (tachypnoea and injection site pain). None of the infants experienced

AEs related to maternal vaccination. No new safety concern was identified in this limited study population. Sections 4.6 and 4.8 of the SmPC are updated accordingly.

## C4591024

Study C4591024 was a Phase 2b study that evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 in immunocompromised participants &gt;2 years of age based and utilised a vaccination series of 3 doses of age adapted Comirnaty followed by a fourth dose 3-6 months after dose 3.

## Efficacy

The main immunogenicity objective was to evaluate neutralising antibody titres among baseline SARSCoV-2 negative immunosuppressed population before and after the 3rd and 4th dose. The study recruited all ages from 2 years and above. The study had also explorative objectives. Most important of those is the evaluation of neutralising antibody titre among entire evaluable immunogenicity population regardless of their baseline SARS-CoV-2 status.

Enrolment in this study was terminated due to enrolment challenges as a result of universal recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination of immunocompromised individuals and the increased global availability of COVID-19 vaccines. Altogether 124 individuals were enrolled to the study, whereas 7 participants were adults. Therefore, the entire study became descriptive.

The immunogenicity data showed that most reduced antibody response appears among those who were on immunomodulatory therapy. The immune response improved for everybody regardless of diagnosis or age after the 4 th  dose. The primary immunogenicity objectives were to describe the immune responses among baseline SARS-CoV-2 negative immunocompromised population. There were roughly quarter of participants with unknown baseline status because these participants did not have some baseline sample (either blood or nasal swab) or had unclear test result. Section 5.1 of SmPC was updated to include a short text describing that all studied immunocompromised groups had higher GMT after fourth dose compared to the third dose. In conclusion, the 4 th  dose of Comirnaty improved neutralising antibody titres among immune-compromised population. This observation is in agreement with an earlier data.

## Safety

The safety database constitutes of a total of 124 immunocompromised participants aged 2 to &lt;5 years (n=37), 5-&lt;12 years (n=65) 12-&lt;18 years (n=15) and ≥18 years (n=7). The dose for each of the 4 vaccinations depended on the age of participants at time of vaccination (&gt;12 years of age: 30-µg dose, 5 to &lt;12 years of age: 10-µg dose, 2 to &lt;5 years: 3-µg dose).

Most of the reactogenicity evens were transient and mild to moderate at intensity. Children aged 2-&lt;5 years old were presented with a mild reactogenicity profile with a low frequency of both local and systemic events (&lt;21%), similar as for non-immunocompromised participants presented in other studies. Children aged 5 to &lt; 12 years that constituted the largest age group (n=65) in this limited study reported local reactions (most common pain at injection site: 53-63%) and systemic events where fatigue (4661%). Fever was reported in 1,5-12%, none had fever &gt;40 o C. Among the participants ≥12 years old (n=22), the reactogenicity profile was in line with the data that has been presented previously for nonimmunocompromised participants. The majority of AEs were in the infections and infestations SOC, and all adverse events of special interests (AESIs) were likely related to participant's underlying condition. There were no deaths, no SAEs assessed as related by the investigator, no life-threatening AEs, and no AEs leading to withdrawal. No new safety concerns were identified in this limited study population of immunocompromised individuals. Section 4.8 of the SmPC is updated accordingly.

## C4591030

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study C4591030, which investigated co-administration of Comirnaty and seasonal influenza vaccine study has been part of RMP since April 2021. 1134 participants were randomised at a ratio of 1:1 into the coadministration group, or the separate administration group (placebo and SIIV)/Comirnaty, stratified by age groups (18 through 49 years and 50 through 64 years) and by history of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) or rapid antigen test prior to randomisation (with prior history of SARS-CoV-2 and without prior history of SARS-CoV-2). Data for this study has been assessed previously in procedure II/0201.

## Efficacy

The primary immunogenicity objective was to demonstrate that the immune responses elicited by Comirnaty when co-administered with SIIV are non-inferior to those elicited by Comirnaty when administered alone, as demonstrated by full-length S-binding IgG levels. The GMR met the pre specified non-inferiority criteria (lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR &gt;0.67) as immunogenicity primary endpoint of this study, which was evaluated during an earlier procedure II/201.

In current update, an overview of results of the secondary BNT162b2 immunogenicity endpoint analyses of SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation titres for a subset of approximately 200 participants were presented. The neutralising assay results from this smaller selected population agree generally with the earlier presented S-protein binding antibody results from entire evaluable immunogenicity population. The antibody titre was very high for both separate and co-administration groups. The antibody concentration was numerically higher in separate administration group compared to the co-administration group according to both serology methods for this selected smaller study population. As assessed in II/0201, the GMRs of the S-protein binding antibody data from entire evaluable immunogenicity population did meet the pre specified non-inferiority criteria. The GMR coadministration vs. separate administration was 0.83 [95% CI: 0.77, 0.89]). For this post-hoc analysis for small subgroup, the GMR would not meet the pre specified non-inferiority criteria for neither of the assays (lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR &gt;0.67). The result was very near to non-inferiority criteria, GMR LL 0.66 for neutralisation and 0.67 for S-binding assay. According to the applicant, this may be due to the sampling variability and smaller sample size of the neutralisation subset.

There will be no immunogenicity data presented from this co-administration study in SmPC as agreed earlier during II/201. The clinical impact for lower titre of neutralising antibodies in case of coadministration with SIIV is unknown.

The benefit-risk balance of COMIRNATY remains positive.

## 5. Introduction

The present submission is intended to provide final immunogenicity, efficacy and safety analyses from studies C4591015 and C4591024, as well as secondary neutralisation titre data from study C4591030. As a result, the MAH has proposed update of the SmPC sections 4.4, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1.

The phase 3 study C4591015 enrolled 348 healthy pregnant women participants ≥18 years of age and their infants, once born. This Phase 2/3 study evaluated 2 doses of BNT162b2 30 µg or placebo administered 21 days apart (Visits 1 and 2) in pregnant women vaccinated at 24 to 34 weeks' gestation.

The phase 2b study C4591024 enrolled a total of 124 immunocompromised participants aged 2 to &lt;18 years (n=117) and ≥18 years (n=7). The study evaluated a 4-dose schedule (the first 2 doses separated by 21 days), with a third dose occurring 28 days after the second dose. The fourth dose was administered 3-6 months after Dose 3, at the discretion of the investigator. The dose for each of the 4 vaccinations depended on the age of participants at time of vaccination (&gt;12 years of age: 30-µg dose, 5 to &lt;12 years of age: 10-µg dose, 2 to &lt;5 years: 3-µg dose).

Study C4591030 evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a fourth dose of BNT162b2 30 µg administered concomitantly with SIIV compared with the vaccines given 1 month apart in adults 18 through 64 years of age who had previously received 3 doses of BNT162b2 30 µg. This study enrolled a total of 1134 participants 18 through 64 years of age who had previously received 3 doses of BNT162b2 30 µg: 568 participants in the coadministration group (BNT162b2 and SIIV)/placebo and 566 participants in the separate-administration group (placebo and SIIV)/BNT162b2. This study has been evaluated earlier during procedure II/201 and the safety data is therefore not included in this report. The MAH has here submitted the SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay results for a subset of participants (N= 100 in each study arm), which was a secondary immunogenicity objective of this study.

## 6. Clinical Efficacy aspects

## 6.1. Study C4591015

## 6.1.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

This was a global Phase 2/3, randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 30 µg of BNT162b2 or placebo administered in 2 doses, 21 days apart, in approximately 350 healthy pregnant women 18 years of age or older vaccinated at 24 to 34 weeks' gestation. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive BNT162b2 or placebo (saline).

The Phase 2 portion of the study included approximately 200 pregnant women enrolled at 27 to 34 weeks' gestation. The IRC reviewed safety data through 7 days after the second dose for all Phase 2 participants. The Phase 3 portion of this study included approximately 150 pregnant women enrolled at 24 to 34 weeks' gestation. Phase 3 proceeded after the first 200 maternal participants had been enrolled in Phase 2. Maternal participants who originally received placebo could receive BNT162b2 at the 1-month post delivery visit.

Enrolment in this study was terminated due to Enrolment challenges as a result of universal recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination of pregnant women and the increased global availability of COVID-19 vaccines.

## Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

Enrolled in this study were participants who were healthy pregnant women ≥18 years of age and their infants, once born. Enrolment was monitored to help ensure distribution of vaccination across the gestational age ranges of 27 0/7 to 34 0/7 weeks for Phase 2 and ≥24 0/7 and ≤34 0/7 weeks for Phase 3.

## Allocation

All participants were centrally assigned to randomised study intervention using an IRT system.

## Blinding

The study was observer-blinded, as the physical appearance of the investigational vaccine and the placebo may differ. The participant, investigator, study coordinator, and other site staff were blinded through the 1-month postdelivery visit for each maternal participant, at which point maternal participants who originally received placebo could receive BNT162b2.

## Immunogenicity

The below assays were performed for immunogenicity analyses, which were all based on samples analysed at the central laboratory.

- -SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay;
- -Full-length S-binding IgG levels;
- -N-binding antibody assay

For the primary immunogenicity objective, the GMR at 1 month after Dose 2 was calculated as the difference in means of logarithmically transformed assay results (SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres in pregnant women minus those in nonpregnant women) and exponentiating the difference. Two-sided CIs were obtained by calculating CIs using Student t distribution for the difference of the means of the logarithmically transformed assay results and exponentiating the confidence limits. The primary immunogenicity analysis included participants without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and with and without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. The nonpregnant participants were randomly selected from Study C4591001 female participants based on 1:1 age matching to the maternal participants within each vaccine group.

## Efficacy

Efficacy was assessed throughout a maternal and infant participant's involvement in the study through surveillance for potential cases of COVID-19. If, at any time, a maternal or infant participant developed acute respiratory illness, for the purposes of the study he or she was considered to potentially have COVID-19 illness. The assessments included a nasal (midturbinate) swab, which was tested at a central laboratory using an approved and validated RT-PCR test, or other equivalent nucleic acid amplificationbased test (i.e., NAAT) to detect SARS-CoV-2. In addition, clinical information and results from local

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

standard-of-care tests were assessed. The central laboratory NAAT result was used for the case definition, unless no result was available from the central laboratory, in which case a local NAAT result could be used.

## Statistics general consideration

All of the immunogenicity analyses were based on the evaluable immunogenicity populations. An additional analysis was performed based on the all-available immunogenicity populations as there was over 10% difference in sample size between the all-available immunogenicity populations and the evaluable immunogenicity populations.

Participants were summarized according to the vaccine group to which they (or their mothers) were randomised.

The efficacy analyses were based on the evaluable efficacy populations. In addition, VE was also analysed by the all-available efficacy (mITT) populations.

Due to early Enrolment termination and reduced sample size, all endpoints were analysed descriptively without formal hypothesis tests.

Subgroup analyses based on race and ethnicity were performed on all primary safety and immunogenicity endpoints (as supplemental analyses).

Analyses among HIV-positive women and their infants were provided separately, as these were considered special populations for this study.

Exploratory analyses of the serological response at baseline, 1 month after Dose 2, delivery, and 6 months after delivery were planned for maternal participants with confirmed COVID- 19, confirmed severe COVID-19, or SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on both protocol and CDC definitions; however, since there were no maternal participants who reported severe COVID-19 and a limited number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, these analyses were not conducted as the sample sizes would have been too small for any meaningful interpretation.

Assessor´s comment : The methodology of the Study C4591015 is similar to the Comirnaty studies reported earlier and is approvable. There were plenty of exploratory objectives for this study, which were not all calculated due to limited sample size. Also, not all of the calculated explorative results are presented in current AR due to non-conclusive results from the limited number of participants.

In immunological comparison, age matched historical control group consisting of non-pregnant women was used. This is not the ideal control group as the time and place for the control is not the same as for the active arm. The study C4591015 recruited since 16.02.2021, whereas C4591001 phase 3 recruited in summer 2020. The time gap between studies was at least 6 months.

Still, we have to accept it as it was not feasible and ethical to conduct a clinical trial on a group, to whom the vaccination with Comirnaty was officially recommended.

The issues of postponement of the study results has been assessed during an earlier procedure EMEA/H/C/005735/MEA/012.2. It was agreed, that due to the high burden in neutralisation assay laboratory, the study results were delayed.

## 6.1.2. Results

## Immunogenicity population-  Maternal Participants

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Exclusions from the evaluable immunogenicity population were balanced across BNT162b2 and placebo groups among C4591015 participants and among C4591001 participants; the most common reason for exclusion for C4591015 participants was due to a lack of at least 1 valid and determinate immunogenicity result within 28-42 days after Dose 2. The proportions of participants without evidence of prior infection for the C4591015 (ca. 33%) and C4591001 (86%) study participants reflect varying conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the studies were conducted in different times and countries.

## Demographics

A greater proportion of C4591015 participants identified as Black or African American (≥27.0% compared with ≥5.3% in C4591001) and a higher percentage were enrolled from South African sites (≥24.3% compared with ≥0.8% in C4591001). Additionally, the proportion of C4591015 maternal participants with positive baseline SARS-CoV-2 status (≥37.8%) was higher than what was observed among C4591001 participants (≥3.5%), which could have been due to the different timepoints at which participants were enrolled in each study relative to the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of participants identified as non-Hispanic/non-Latino (≥62.2%). The median age of participants at Dose 1 was 30.0 years, and the median gestational age at Dose 1 for the BNT162b2 and placebo groups was 28.9 weeks and 29.1 weeks, respectively. Both groups were similar with regards to HIV status. Pre-pregnancy BMIs for C4591015 maternal participants were generally higher than those observed in C4591001 nonpregnant female participants .

Assessor´s comment: the study pregnancy study recruited mainly in USA (47%), South Africa (24%) and Spain (14%), whereas the historical control population was from USA (57%), Argentina (21%), Brazil (14%) and Germany(4%). The geographical origin of study population may influence the antibody levels among baseline seropositives as different SARS-COV-2 were spread in different locations. Also it is unknown, how many different SARS-CoV-2 infections every seropositive participant have had. As the historical control was recruited early in the pandemic, much higher proportion was still seronegative (95%) compared to the pregnancy study population (55-60 %).

## Immunogenicity population - Infant Participants

The proportions of infant participants included in the immunogenicity populations were balanced between the BNT162b2 and placebo groups. The evaluable immunogenicity population for infant participants included 109 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 105 participants in the placebo group. The proportion of participants excluded from the evaluable immunogenicity population was 34.7% and 37.5% for the BNT162b2 group and the placebo group, respectively. The most frequent reason for exclusion of infant participants from the evaluable immunogenicity populations was because the mother was not considered to be an evaluable immunogenicity maternal participant.

Demographics and baseline characteristics for the safety population of infant participants were balanced for the BNT162b2 and placebo groups. The majority of participants were White (67%), non-Hispanic/nonLatino (64%), and located in the US (48%) or South Africa (27%). The majority of infants were born ≥37 weeks to 41 weeks 6 days, and 89% of infant participants were breastfed. Both groups were similar with regards to HIV status.

Efficacy population- maternal participants

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The evaluable efficacy population included 161 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 163 participants in the placebo group.

Exclusions from the evaluable efficacy population were similar across groups; the most common reason was due to other protocol deviation(s) as determined by the clinician.

The evaluable efficacy population without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to 7 days after Dose 2 included 91 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 94 participants in the placebo group.

## Efficacy population- infant participants

The evaluable efficacy population included 167 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 168 participants in the placebo group.

For infants born to mothers in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups, most (88.0% and 90.5%,respectively) were breastfed and few (6.6% and 5.4%, respectively) were born to mothers who were HIV-positive.

## Primary immunogenicity - Maternal GMR of Neutralising Titres

- Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2 (evaluable immunogenicity population), the ratio of the neutralising GMT (GMR) in Study C4591015 maternal participants in the BNT162b2 (30 µg) group to that of Study C4591001 nonpregnant females who received BNT162b2 30 µg was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.90). See the table below, which is the version MAH intends to be added to the SmPC.
- For participants with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2 (evaluable immunogenicity population), the model-adjusted ratio of the neutralising GMT (adjusted GMR) in Study C4591015 maternal participants in the BNT162b2 (30 µg) group to that of Study C4591001 nonpregnant females who received BNT162b2 30 µg was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.30).

Note: Participants from Study 2 are a selected subset of age matched nonpregnant female Phase 3 participants.

- Participants who had no serological or virological evidence (prior to the 1 month after Dose 2 blood sample collection) of past SARS-CoV-2 infection (ie. N-binding antibody [serum] negative at Dose 1 and 1 month after Dose 2 and no positive result between visits, negative NAAT [nasal swab] at Dose 1, Dose 2, and any unscheduled visit prior to the 1 month after Dose 2 blood sample collection) were included in the analysis.
- SARS-CoV-2 NT50 were determined using a validated 384-well assay platform (original strain [USA-WA1/2020, isolated in January 2020]).
- b. Protocol-specified timing for blood sample collection.
- C n = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at the given dose/sampling time point.
- d. GMTs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LL OQ were set to O.5 x LLOQ.

Assessor´s comment: the GMR analysis was descriptive, but the data shows, that antibody level was higher among non-pregnant women, especially among those without earlier SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is expected results and in agreement with earlier data. We suggested to use short text instead of the table to describe that pregnant woman had lower GMT and GMR than non-pregnant women from historical control group (OC), which the Applicant has followed in an updated SmPC.

## Secondary Immunogenicity Analyses- Maternal participants

Neutralising GMTs and Full-length S-binding IgG GMCs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In maternal participants in the BNT162b2 group, GMTs of neutralising antibodies and full-length S-binding IgG GMTs were substantially increased, compared to the placebo group, peaked at 2 weeks after Dose 2 and remained elevated through the 6-month postdelivery visit. See the results in Table below. Results for participants in the evaluable immunogenicity population with or without evidence of infection followed a similar trend.

Assessor´s comment: the neutralising and binding antibody levels show agreement, so that the highest levels were measured 2 weeks post dose 2. The levels then started to lower reaching 3-4x lower levels at 6 months post-delivery timepoint in comparison to the 2 weeks post dose 2. This antibody kinetics is in agreement with an earlier data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The placebo group demonstrated about the same low antibody level than at the baseline during entire study period.

## GFMRs

GMFRs of neutralising and binding antibodies at 1 month after Dose 2 was substantially higher in the BNT162b2 group  compared to the placebo group. In maternal participants in the BNT162b2 group, the GMFR for neutralising and full- length S- binding antibodies peaked at 2 weeks after Dose 2 and remained elevated through the delivery visit and 6-month postdelivery timepoints. See the results below. Results for participants in the overall evaluable immunogenicity population followed a similar trend.

## Subgroup Analyses

GMTs at prevaccination (Dose 1) and 1 month after Dose 2 were evaluated by race, ethnicity, and baseline SARS-CoV-2 status in Study C4591015 maternal participants and Study C4591001 nonpregnant females, see table below. Among participants with or without evidence of infection, higher baseline and post-vaccination titres were observed in Black/African American participants as compared to other race groups. Higher GMTs were also observed in participants with positive baseline SARS-CoV-2 status at both baseline and 1 month after Dose 2 timepoints compared to those observed in participants with negative baseline status.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, GMTs for the BNT162b2 groups for both studies were generally similar and did not identify any clinically meaningful differences for any other race subgroup or ethnicity. As several subgroups included a limited number of participants, these results should be interpreted with caution

Assessor´s comment: the highest impact for antibody level after 1 month post dose 2 is the baseline SARS-COV-2 baseline status. Priming with natural infection results with 5-8 fold higher antibody titres compared to SARS-CoV-2 naïve population. The other factors such as race and ethnicity have less impact. This is expected results and in agreement with an earlier data.

## Secondary Immunogenicity Analyses - Infant Participants

Full-length S-binding IgG GMCs

- Maternal vaccination with BNT162b2 30 µg yielded substantially higher GMCs of full-length Sbinding IgG in infants compared to placebo. For the evaluable immunogenicity population, at birth and 6 months of age GMCs were 5576.4 (95% CI: 4246.2, 7323.2) and 311.1 (95% CI: 235.8, 410.5) respectively for infants whose mothers received BNT162b2, compared to 19.4 (95% CI: 10.2, 37.0) and 22.0 (95% CI: 11.4, 42.7) for infants whose mothers received placebo, see the results in the table below.

Assessor´s comment: no neutralising test was performed in infant participants, but the binding antibodies were evaluated. Anyhow, as binding and neutralising antibodies have demonstrated good agreement, this is acceptable. These data show successful antibody transfer through placenta, which is expected results and in agreement with data from other vaccines.

It is noted, that in infants, the binding antibody levels were about double as high as in their mothers at the delivery, but lowered much more than in their mothers. While in their mothers, the antibody level was about half reduced 6 months after the delivery, then in infants, the levels were reduced 20- fold. Anyhow, these data show, that maternal immunisation results in high antibody level in their infants and is most likely protective several months post-delivery.

The MAH wishes to present this data in SmPC as a text as following:

Despite that the immunogenicity evaluation in newborns was a secondary objective, the MAH removed this part from 5.1 following a request in an RSI.

## GMFRs

- In infants in the evaluable immunogenicity population whose mothers received BNT162b2, the GMFR of full-length S-binding IgG from birth to 6 months of age was 0.1 [95% CI: 0.0, 0.1], indicating a decline in antibody titres during this period.

## Exploratory Subgroup Analyses

GMCs of full-length S-binding IgG in infants in the evaluable immunogenicity population were evaluated by breastfeeding status, see the table below. GMCs for breastfed infants were generally higher than those observed for infants who were not breastfed. GMCs for breastfed or not breastfed infants whose mothers received BNT162b2 were substantially higher at birth compared to infants whose mothers received placebo, and remained elevated at 6 months of age. As the not breasted subgroup included a limited number of participants, these results should be interpreted with caution.

Assessor´s comment: these data show that breastfed babies have somewhat higher level of binding antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 than babies, who have got antibodies through placental transfer only. This means that antibodies from vaccinated mothers milk are stable enough to survive passage through

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

gastrointestinal tract and baby is immunized passively through breastmilk. This is expected results and in agreement with earlier data from other vaccines.

The clinical impact of this antibody level difference between breastfed and not breastfed babies is unknown. There is no data of levels of neutralising antibodies in breastmilk compared to serum in vaccinated mothers.

## Immunogenicity Conclusions

The immunogenicity outcomes for evaluable maternal participants in this study are as follows:

- The observed SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising GMT 1 month after Dose 2 was lower in the maternal participants without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, when compared to similar nonpregnant female participants from Study C4591001, which is consistent with what has been observed in other maternal COVID vaccine studies across the wider literature.
- In the group inclusive of participants with prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, maternal participants had higher antibody levels than nonpregnant participants from Study C4591001. This observation is due to the higher prior SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in the maternal participants. After accounting for the baseline neutralising titres, the model-adjusted SARSCoV-2 50% neutralising GMT in maternal participants was numerically lower than nonpregnant comparators.
- The SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising GMTs and full-length S-binding IgG GMCs for both participants without prior infection and those with or without prior infection were substantially higher in groups vaccinated with BNT162b2 versus the placebo group for all post-vaccination timepoints.
- The SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising GMT and full-length S-binding IgG GMC responses for both participants without prior infection and those with or without prior infection were highest 2 weeks after Dose 2 and dropped at the 6 month after Dose 2 timepoint. Antibody levels remained elevated in participants vaccinated with BNT162b2 at the 6 month timepoint compared to those observed in the placebo group at any previous timepoint.
- There was an increase in SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising GMTs and GMCs of full-length Sbinding IgG from the Dose 1 prevaccination to the Dose 2 prevaccination time points; however, this increase was not as substantial as the increase observed after post-Dose 2.

The immunogenicity outcomes for evaluable infant participants in this study are as follows:

- Full-length S-binding IgG GMC levels at birth were higher in the infants born to vaccinated maternal participants than those born to participants in the placebo group. These concentrations dropped over the following 6 months but remained higher in infants born to vaccinated participants compared to those born to participants in the placebo group, even at the 6 month post-birth timepoint.
- Comparing the maternal and infant full-length S-binding IgG GMCs [4336.9 (95% CI: 3456.0, 5442.4) at 1-month post-dose 2 and 5576.4 (95% CI: 4246.2, 7323.2) at birth respectively] indicates effective transplacental transfer of antibody.

Assessor´s comment: the efficacy population was small, below 100 in each arm and in both arms had equal number of cases (n=2). This results in very wide 95 % CI and no conclusions can be made.

Vaccine Efficacy Against Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection Based on Seroconversion (N-Binding)

For asymptomatic infection, based on N-binding antibody seroconversion, in the evaluable efficacy population of maternal participants without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the first post-Dose 2 N-binding test, the VE had wide 95% CI due to the limited number of participants and these results should be interpreted with caution.

Assessor´s comment: due to the low sample size, the uncertainty of the VE estimate is large, but in placebo group there were more cases of asymptomatic infections (10/89) than in vaccinated arm (4/84).

## 6.1.3. Discussion

The study C4591015 was a global Phase 2/3, randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 30 µg of BNT162b2 or placebo administered in 2 doses, 21 days apart, in approximately 350 healthy pregnant women 18 years of age or older vaccinated at 24 to 34 weeks' gestation. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive BNT162b2 or placebo (saline).

Enrolment in this study was terminated due to enrolment challenges as a result of universal recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination of pregnant women and the increased global availability of COVID-19 vaccines. The original study protocol was amended 5 times mainly to adapt the protocol to the requests from the authorities and to the reduced sample size.

The methodology of the Study C4591015 was similar to the Comirnaty studies reported earlier and is acceptable. The primary immunogenicity endpoints were evaluated using neutralising assay and secondary endpoints S-protein binding antibodies. The primary immunogenicity objective was to compare neutralising antibody titres in pregnant women compared to the age matched non-pregnant women 1 months post- dose 2. The secondary objectives were to investigate VE, describe antibody levels of mothers and their infants at different time points, up to delivery and 6 months post-delivery. There were also plenty of exploratory objectives for this study, which not all gave meaningful results due to the limited sample size.

In immunological comparison, about 110 individuals in each study arm in pregnant cohort were age matched with the historical control group consisting of non- pregnant woman from study C4591001. Both studies were randomised, placebo-controlled and observer-blind. Anyhow, this was not the ideal control group as the time and place for the control is not the same as for the active arm. The study C4591015 recruited since 16.02.2021, whereas C4591001 phase 3 recruited in summer 2020. The time gap between studies was at least 6 months. The pregnancy study recruited mainly in USA (47%), South Africa (24%) and Spain (14%), whereas the historical control population was from USA (57%), Argentina (21%), Brazil (14%) and Germany (4%). The geographical origin of study population may influence the antibody levels among baseline seropositives as different SARS-COV2 were spread in different locations. Also it is unknown, how many different SARS-Cov2 infections every seropositive participant have had. As the historical control was recruited early in the pandemic, much higher proportion was still seronegative (95%) compared to the pregnancy study population (55-60%). Still, we have to accept this kind of historical control as it was not feasible and ethical to conduct a placebo controlled clinical trial on a group, to whom the vaccination with Comirnaty was officially recommended.

The GMR analysis of neutralising antibodies was descriptive, but the data shows, that antibody level was higher among non-pregnant women, especially when those without earlier SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared. This is expected results and in agreement with earlier data. The MAH wishes to add a table including immunogenicity information from pregnant and non-pregnant women to the SmPC. We suggested to use a short text instead of a table describing that GMT and GMR was lower among pregnant compared to the non-pregnant from historical control (OC), which the Applicant has followed in an updated SmPC.

The neutralising and S protein binding antibody levels show agreement. The highest levels of both kind of antibodies were measured 2 weeks post dose 2. The levels then started to lower reaching 3-4x lower levels at 6 months post- delivery timepoint in comparison to the 2 weeks post dose 2. This kind of

antibody kinetics is in agreement with an earlier data. The placebo group demonstrated about the same low antibody level than at the baseline during entire study period.

Subgroup analysis show that the highest impact for antibody level after 1 month post dose 2 is the baseline SARS-CoV-2 baseline status. Priming with natural infection results with 5-8 fold higher antibody titres compared to SARS-CoV-2 naïve population. This is expected results and in agreement with an earlier data.

About 110 infants born for both vaccinated and placebo arm mothers were evaluated for S-protein binding antibodies. No neutralisation assay was performed for serum from infant participants. Anyhow, as binding and neutralising antibodies have demonstrated good agreement, this is acceptable. At the delivery, there was high level of S-protein binding antibodies in infants. This is a sign of a successful antibody transfer through placenta, which is expected results and in agreement with data from other vaccines. The MAH wishes to add immunogenicity data in newborns to the SmPC despite that the immunogenicity evaluation in newborns was a secondary objective. Still we agree that this information is important to be presented in SmPC.

It is noted, that in infants, the binding antibody levels were about double as high as in their mothers at the delivery, but lowered much more than in their mothers. While in their mothers, the antibody level was about half reduced 6 months after the delivery, then in infants, the levels were reduced 20- fold. Anyhow, these data show, that maternal immunisation results in high antibody level in their infants and is most likely protective several months post-delivery.

One of the explorative objectives were to compare the antibody levels 6 months post delivery among breastfed babies in comparison for those who were not. These data show that breastfed babies had somewhat higher level of binding antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 than babies, who have got antibodies through placental transfer only. This means that antibodies from vaccinated mothers milk are stable enough to survive passage through gastrointestinal tract and baby is immunized passively through breastmilk. This is expected results and in agreement with earlier data from other vaccines. There is no data of levels of neutralising antibodies in breastmilk compared to serum in vaccinated mothers. The clinical impact of this antibody level difference between breastfed and not breastfed babies is unknown.

Vaccine efficacy evaluation in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women was a secondary objective for this study. Due to the very small sample size resulting from early termination of Enrolment the number of COVID-19 cases was also low and VE results were uninterpretable. In VE evaluation for symptomatic Covid-19, there was equal number of cases (N=2) in both study arms (ca N=90). In VE evaluation for asymptomatic COVID-19 placebo group there were more cases of asymptomatic infections (10/89) than in vaccinated arm (4/84).

In conclusion, this descriptive study demonstrated that antibody titres were somewhat lower in pregnant women compared to the non-pregnant women in historical control group. These antibodies were transferred through placenta and the newborns had high levels of antibodies in their blood at the delivery. After 6 months the antibody titres in babies was strongly reduced, but still higher that in the placebo group. Breastfeeding helps to maintain higher antibody titres. These observations are in agreement with earlier data.

## 6.2. Study C4591024

## 6.2.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

Study C4591024 was a Phase 2b study that evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 in participants &gt;2 years of age based on representative medical conditions and utilized a vaccination series of 3 doses (the first 2 doses separated by 21 days, with a third dose occurring 28 days after the second dose) followed by a fourth dose 3-6 months after dose 3. The dose for each of the 4 vaccinations depended upon the age of the participant at the time of vaccination.

- For the 22 participants who were &gt;12 years of age, a 30 μg dose level was used.
- For the 65 participants who were 5 to &lt;12 years of age, a 10 μg dose level was used.
- For the 37 participants who were 2 to &lt;5 years of age, a 3 μg dose level was used.

Enrolment in this study was terminated due to enrolment challenges as a result of universal recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination of immunocompromised individuals and the increased global availability of COVID-19 vaccines.

Assessor´s comment: the main immunogenicity objective was to evaluate neutralising antibody titre among baseline SARS-CoV-2 negative immunosuppressed population before and after the 3 rd  and 4 th dose. The study recruited all ages from 2 years and above. The study had also explorative objectives, most important of those is the evaluate neutralising antibody titre among entire evaluable immunogenicity population regardless of their baseline SARS-CoV-2 status.

## Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

Individuals were excluded from the study if they had a past clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID19, or a past clinical diagnosis of MIS-C. Individuals were also excluded from the study if they had active GVHD, transplant rejection, or PTLD, or were treated for one of these conditions within 3 months before Enrolment. A bleeding diathesis or condition associated with prolonged bleeding that would contraindicate an IM injection, a medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within past year) or active suicidal ideation/behaviour and pregnant or breastfeeding individuals were also excluded. Individuals were also excluded if they had a history of severe adverse reaction associated with a vaccine and/or severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the study intervention.

## Blinding

This was an open-label study.

## Immunogenicity Endpoints and Analysis

For all the immunogenicity endpoints, the analysis were based on the evaluable immunogenicity population. An additional analysis was performed based on the corresponding all-available immunogenicity population. Participants were summarized according to the vaccine group to which they were assigned.

## Geometric Means

The geometric means were calculated as the mean of the assay results after making the logarithm transformation and then exponentiating the mean to express results on the original scale. Two-sided 95% CIs were obtained by taking log transforms of assay results, calculating the 95% CI with reference to Student's t-distribution, and then exponentiating the confidence limits.

## Geometric Mean Fold Rises

GMFRs were defined as ratios of the results after vaccination to the results before vaccination. GMFRs were limited to participants with nonmissing values at both time points. GMFRs were calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed assay results (later time point minus earlier time point) and exponentiating the mean. The associated 2-sided 95% CIs were obtained by constructing CIs using Student's t-distribution for the mean difference on the logarithm scale and exponentiating the confidence limits.

## Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves

Empirical RCDCs plotted proportions of participants with values equal to or exceeding a specified assay value versus the indicated assay value, for all observed assay values. Data points were joined by a step function with data points on the left side of the step.

## 6.2.2. Results

## Changes in study conduct

There have been 5 protocol amendments during the study. Some changes were purely administrative clarifications initially reported in PACLs. Other more important changes are listed below:

- Removal of the requirement to conduct a potential COVID-19/MIS-C convalescent visit following each COVID-19/MIS-C illness visit.
- Removal of the exploratory objective looking into viral shedding in line with the removal of the convalescent visit.
- Addition of primary and exploratory safety, tolerability, and immune response objectives for the expanded cohort of participants on active immunomodulator therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Updated Visit 5 window to allow its occurrence as early as 28 days after Visit 2 and updated wording to allow subgroup analysis of immunogenicity endpoints based on various timing of Dose 3. These changes were made to be in line with Regulatory recommendations for providing a 3rd dose of BNT162b2 to immunocompromised individuals.
- Updated procedures to allow a fourth dose (booster), reducing the window for provision of Dose 3, and allowing vaccination with the age-appropriate dose.
- Updated the number of participants in each group based on actual recruitment figures.
- Removed further blood draws for participants who have consented to PBMC sampling.

Assessor´s comment: the changes of the study protocol has been assessed earlier during procedures PAM MEA/016.0-0.16.6.

Assessor´s comment: The MAH faced problems to recruit the desired sample size for the planned study among immunocompromised population. The study started to recruit subjects in October 2021, which is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

already 10 months since CMA for Comirnaty 30 µg for adults in EU. Indeed, all countries provided vaccine against COVID-19 after the authorisation at first to the most vulnerable population, which includes the immunocompromised individuals. Therefore, it is not surprising, that the desired sample size was unreachable. Therefore, it was considered acceptable to stop recruiting subjects during procedure PAM 016.4 September 2022 and continue with the available study population.

The largest sample size was achieved among age group 5-&lt;12 years, who received 10 µg Comirnaty. Older cohorts, which received adult dose 30 µg Comirnaty, recruited very low number as for older than 12, the vaccine was officially recommended at the time of the study.

The majority of study population was from USA and Germany and was SARS-CoV-2 negative at the baseline. There was rather large proportion, about 20% of participants in age group 5-&lt;18 with unknown baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. This is strange and need a clarification (OC). The MAH answered that these participants did not have some baseline sample (either blood or nasal swab) or had unclear test result.

## GMTs- 1 months post dose 3 or 4

## Participants without evidence of infection

## Participants 2 to &lt; 5 Years of Age

In total, GMTs were higher at 1 month after Dose 3 (741.6) and 1 month after Dose 4 (2219.5) compared to levels observed before study vaccination across all disease subsets. At 6 months after Dose 4, GMTs were reduced across all disease subsets (293.2). No participants in the stem cell transplant group had a valid and determinate assay result at any time point.

Between disease subsets, GMTs were generally similar between participants in the immunomodulatory therapy group and the solid organ transplant group at 1 month after Dose 3 (600.2 and 884.7, respectively) and before Dose 4 (266.3 and 870.6, respectively). At 1 month after Dose 4, GMTs were higher in the solid organ transplant group (9576.3) than in the immunomodulatory therapy group (837.5).

Assessor´s comment: the sample size in this age group was small, especially when dividing into subgroups and therefore conclusions should be drawn carefully. Anyhow, the data shows, that most reduced antibody response appears among those who are on immunomodulatory therapy. The immune response improved for all after the 4 th  dose.

## Participants 5 to &lt; 12 Years of Age

In total, GMTs were higher at 1 month after Dose 3 (1612.0) and 1 month after Dose 4 (3270.8) compared to levels observed before study vaccination across all disease subsets. At 6 months after Dose 4, GMTs were reduced across all disease subsets (296.7).

Between disease subsets, GMTs were lowest in participants in the immunomodulatory therapy group before Dose 4 (258.3), 1 month after Dose 4 (754.2), and 6 months after Dose 4 (135.5). At 1 month after Dose 3, GMTs were higher in the stem cell transplant group (4592.3) than in the immunomodulatory therapy group (758.4) and the solid organ transplant group (741.2). At 1 month after Dose 4, GMTs in the solid organ transplant group (5335.3) and the stem cell transplant group (5330.8) were both higher than those in the immunomodulatory therapy group (754.2).

Assessor´s comment: the data shows, that most reduced antibody response appears among those who are on immunomodulatory therapy. The immune response improved for all after the 4 th  dose. As this age group had the largest sample size in this study, these results are the most trustable.

## Participants 12 to &lt; 18 Years of Age

At 1 month after Dose 3, GMTs in the immunomodulatory therapy group, solid organ transplant group, and stem cell transplant group were 7330.0, 43.5 and 2368.1, respectively Only 1 participant in the solid organ transplant group had a valid and determinate assay result at 1 month after Dose 4 (2845.0).

Assessor´s comment: the sample size is too low to make separate analysis for subgroups.  The immune response improved for all after the 4 th  dose.

Participants ≥18 Years of Age

GMTs were only able to be determined for participants in the immunomodulatory therapy group at all 4 time points and for 1 participant in the haemodialysis group at prevaccination and at 1 month after Dose 3. In total, GMTs were higher at 1 month after Dose 3 (344.6) and elevated 1 month after Dose 4 (1474.0) compared to levels observed before study vaccination.

Assessor´s comment: the sample size is too low to make separate analysis for subgroups.  The immune response improved for all after the 4 th  dose.

Participants with or without evidence of infection

GMTs were observed to be higher across all timepoints in participants with or without evidence of prior infection compared to those without evidence of infection, see the table below, which MAH wishes to be added to the SmPC.

Assessor´s comment: the primary immunogenicity objectives were to describe the immune responses among immunosuppressed baseline SARS-CoV-2 negative population. The MAH wishes to update the SmPC with a table presenting immune responses regardless of the baseline SARS-CoV-2 status, which was an exploratory objective. There were roughly quarter of participants with unknown baseline status and the sample size is small even for entire evaluable immunogenicity population. The data shows mainly, that the 4 th  dose improves the antibody titre in all studied age groups including immunosuppressed individuals from 2 years and older. This observation is in agreement with an earlier data.  We suggested to replace the table above with a short text describing that all groups had higher GMT after fourth dose (OC), which the Applicant has followed in an updated SmPC.

## GMFRs From Before Dose 1 to Each Subsequent Timepoint

## Participants Without Evidence of Infection

Similar to the pattern observed in GMTs, the GMFRs in participants without evidence of prior infection in the evaluable immunogenicity population were observed to be higher at 1 month after Dose 3 and 1 month after Dose 4 across all age groups.

## Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection

In the evaluable immunogenicity population, GMFRs were observed to be generally higher across all timepoints in participants with or without evidence of prior infection compared to those without evidence of infection.

## GMFRs From Before Dose 4 to Each Subsequent Timepoint

## Participants Without Evidence of Infection

## Participants 2 to &lt; 5 Years of Age

In the evaluable immunogenicity population, no participants in the stem cell transplant group had valid and determinate assay results at both prevaccination time points and at the given dose/ sampling time points.

At 6 months after Dose 4, 1 (50.0%) out of the 2 participants with assay results at 6 months after Dose 4 achieved seroresponse to the reference strain.

## Participants 5 to &lt; 12 Years of Age

In total, the proportion of participants without evidence of infection in the Dose 3 or Dose 4 evaluable immunogenicity population who achieved seroresponse to the reference strain at 1 month after Dose 3 was 80.8% (95% CI: 60.6, 93.4) and 66.7% (95% CI: 41.0, 86.7) before Dose 4. Seroresponse rate was 87.5% (95% CI: 47.3, 99.7) at 1 month after Dose 4 and 33.3% (95% CI: 4.3, 77.7) at 6 months after Dose 4.

## Immunogenicity Conclusions

Analysis of immunogenicity data at 1 month after Dose 3 (26 participants 2 to &lt;5 years of age, 56 participants 5 to &lt;12 years of age, 11 participants 12 to &lt;18 years of age, and 4 participants ≥18 years of age) and 1 month after Dose 4 (16 participants 2 to &lt;5 years of age, 31 participants 5 to &lt;12 years of age, 6 participants 12 to &lt;18 years of age, and 4 participants ≥18 years of age) in the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior infection demonstrated a vaccine-elicited immune response.

## GMTs

GMTs were observed to be higher at 1 month after Dose 3 and 1 month after Dose 4 compared to levels observed before study vaccination across age groups and disease subsets.

## GMFRs

Similar to the pattern observed in GMTs, the GMFRs were observed to be higher 1 month after Dose 3 and 1 month after Dose 4 across age groups and disease subsets.

## Seroresponse

The proportion of participants achieving seroresponse to the reference strain was observed to be highest at 1 month after Dose 4 across age groups and disease subsets.

## 6.2.3. Discussion

Study C4591024 was a Phase 2b study that evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 in immunocompromised participants &gt;2 years of age based and utilized a vaccination series of 3 doses of age adapted Comirnaty followed by a fourth dose 3-6 months after dose 3.

The main immunogenicity objective was to evaluate neutralising antibody titre among baseline SARSCOV-2 negative immunosuppressed population before and after the 3rd and 4th dose. The study recruited all ages from 2 years and above. The study had also explorative objectives, most important of those is the evaluate neutralising antibody titre among entire evaluable immunogenicity population regardless of their baseline SARS-COV-2 status.

Enrolment in this study was terminated due to enrolment challenges as a result of universal recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination of immunocompromised individuals and the increased global availability of COVID-19 vaccines. The MAH faced problems to recruit the desired sample size for the planned study among immunocompromised population. The study started to recruit subjects in October 2021, which is already 10 months since CMA for Comirnaty 30 µg for adults in EU. Indeed, all countries provided vaccine against COVID-19 after the authorisation at first to the most vulnerable population, which includes the immunocompromised individuals. Therefore, it is not surprising, that the desired sample size was unreachable. Therefore, it was considered acceptable to stop recruiting subjects during procedure PAM 016.4 September 2022 and continue with the available study population. Altogether 124 individuals were enrolled to the study, whereas 7 participants were adults. Therefore entire study became descriptive.

The largest sample size was achieved among age group 5-&lt;12 years, who received 10 µg Comirnaty. Older cohorts, which received adult dose 30 µg Comirnaty, recruited very low number as for older than 12, the vaccine was officially recommended at the time of the study.

The majority of study population was from USA and Germany and was SARS-CoV-2 negative at the baseline. There was rather large proportion, about 25% of participants in age group 5-&lt;18 with unknown

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. The reason was unknown and needed a clarification from the MAH (OC). The Applicant explained that absence of the baseline sample (either blood or nasal swab) or unclear test result caused the 'unknown baseline Covid-19 status' label for about 20% of participants.

The immunogenicity data shows, that most reduced antibody response appears among those who were on immunomodulatory therapy. The immune response improved for everybody regardless of diagnosis or age after the 4 th  dose.

The primary immunogenicity objectives were to describe the immune responses among baseline SARSCoV-2 negative immunocompromised population. The MAH wishes to update the SmPC with a table presenting immune responses regardless of the baseline SARS-CoV-2 status, which was an exploratory objective. There were roughly 20 % of participants with unknown baseline status and the sample size is small even for entire evaluable immunogenicity population. The data shows mainly, that the 4 th  dose improves the antibody titre in all studied age groups including immunosuppressed individuals from 2 years and older. We suggest to replace the table with a short text describing improved immunogenicity after the 4 th  dose for all studies groups (OC), which the Applicant has followed in an updated SmPC.

In conclusion, the 4 th  dose of Comirnaty improved neutralising antibody titres among immunocompromised population. This observation is in agreement with an earlier data.

## 6.3. Study C4591030

## 6.3.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

Study C4591030 was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, observer-blind, 2-arm, parallel-design study conducted in Australia and New Zealand. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a fourth dose of BNT162b2 administered concomitantly with SIIV compared with the vaccines given 1 month apart in adults 18 through 64 years of age who had previously received 3 doses of BNT162b2. Approximately 1126 participants were planned to be randomised at a ratio of 1:1 into the coadministration group (BNT162b2 and SIIV)/placebo, or the separate-administration group (placebo and SIIV)/BNT162b2, stratified by age groups (18 through 49 years and 50 through 64 years) and by history of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results by NAAT or rapid antigen test prior to randomisation (with prior history of SARS-CoV-2 and without prior history of SARS-CoV-2).

Results pertaining to the primary, secondary, and exploratory objectives for Study C4591030 were previously described in the C4591030 Final CSR (dated 29 June 2023), which was submitted, reviewed and approved via EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0201 (CHMP Opinion: 30 May 2024, EC decision: 03 July 2024). As requested in the EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0201 final assessment report, an overview of results of the secondary BNT162b2 immunogenicity endpoint analyses of SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation titres for a subset of approximately 200 participants.

The evaluable BNT162b2 immunogenicity population of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay subset included 100 (100%) participants in the coadministration group and 100 (100%) in the separateadministration group. No participants were excluded from the evaluable BNT162b2 immunogenicity population of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay subset.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Participants without evidence of infection up to 1 month after BNT162b2 vaccination included 60 (60.0%) in the coadministration group and 60 (60.0%) in the separate-administration group.

## Secondary Immunogenicity Analyses

SARS-CoV-2 Neutralising Geometric Mean Titres and Geometric Mean Fold-rises

In the evaluable BNT162b2 immunogenicity population of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay subset, reference strain neutralising GMTs were increased from baseline to 1 month after BNT162b2 vaccination among both the coadministration and separate-administration groups. GMTs were slightly lower in the coadministration group compared with the separate- administration group at 1 month after vaccination. SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titre GMFRs for the reference strain from before vaccination to 1 month after BNT162b2 vaccination were 2.5 (95% CI: 2.1, 2.9) in the coadministration group and 3.3 (95% CI: 2.7, 3.9) in the separate-administration group.

An ad hoc analysis of model-based GMR (coadministration group to separate-administration group), which was not prespecified, was also conducted for the SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay subset. The model-based GMR for the SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay (reference strain) in the subset was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.96), very similar to that observed for the full- length S-binding IgG assay in the same subset of participants. The model-based GMR for the full-length S-binding IgG assay (coadministration group to separate-administration group) was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.89) in the overall study population in the primary analysis, while in the neutralisation assay subset the GMR was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.89).

serology method. For this post- hoc analysis for small subgroup, the GMR would not meet the pre specified non-inferiority criteria (lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR &gt;0.67) There will be no immunogenicity data presented from this co-administration study in SmPC as agreed earlier during II/201. The clinical impact for lower neutralising antibody titre in case of separate administration is unknown.

## Immunogenicity Conclusions

Secondary BNT162b2 Immunogenicity - SARS-CoV-2 Neutralisation Assay Subset

- SARS-CoV-2 reference strain GMTs were increased from baseline to 1 month after BNT162b2 vaccination among both the coadministration and separate-administration groups. GMTs were slightly lower in the coadministration group compared with the separate-administration group at 1 month after vaccination.
- GMFRs for the reference strain from before study vaccination to 1 month after BNT162b2 vaccination were slightly lower in the coadministration group (2.5 [95% CI: 2.1, 2.9]) compared with the separate-administration group (3.3 [95% CI: 2.7, 3.9]).
- Due to the sampling variability and smaller sample size of the neutralisation subset, the lower bounds of the 95% CI of the model-based GMRs were lower than seen for the full-length Sbinding IgG assay in the overall study population in the primary analysis; however, the point estimates of GMRs for the SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay and full-length S-binding IgG assay were similar: 0.77 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.89) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.96) for the full-length Sbinding IgG assay and the SARS- CoV-2 neutralisation assay (reference strain) in the neutralisation subset respectively, compared to 0.83 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.89) in the overall study population in the primary analysis for the full-length S-binding IgG.

## 6.3.3. Discussion

The primary results were evaluated during procedure II/201, but are repeated here to put the new results into the context.

Because the recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination and influenza vaccination have a considerable overlap, including recommended age groups, at-risk populations, and timing, both vaccines may need to be administered at the same time. Such guidance is already provided in the USA and European Union, and by the World Health Organization (WHO) since autumn 2022.

The study C4591030, which investigates co-administration of Comirnaty and seasonal influenza vaccine study has been part of RMP since April 2021.

1134 participants were randomised at a ratio of 1:1 into the coadministration group, or the separate administration group (placebo and SIIV)/Comirnaty, stratified by age groups (18 through 49 years and 50 through 64 years) and by history of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results by NAAT or rapid antigen test prior to randomisation (with prior history of SARS CoV-2 and without prior history of SARS-CoV-2).

The primary immunogenicity objective was to demonstrate that the immune responses elicited by Comirnaty when co-administered with SIIV  are noninferior to those elicited by Comirnaty when administered alone, as demonstrated by full-length S-binding IgG levels. The full-length S-binding IgG measurement results showed that binding antibody concentration was numerically higher in separate administration group compared to the co-administration group (non-overlapping GMC 95% CI). The GMR coadministration vs. separate administration was 0.83 [95% CI: 0.77, 0.89]). The GMR met the pre specified non-inferiority criteria (lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR &gt;0.67) as immunogenicity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

primary endpoint of this study. S-binding IgG levels has not been used earlier as a primary immunogenicity endpoint in Comirnaty studies. Neutralisation assay is seen as the most relevant to demonstrate protection against infection.

Already during the study report evaluation (MEA 018) we noted that the primary SARS-CoV-2 Immunogenicity endpoint for this study is full-length S-binding IgG  levels and not the neutralising antibodies. At the same time, SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody titre  is a secondary endpoint and was planned to be evaluated for a subset of approximately 200 participants. The approach of choosing binding antibodies as a primary endpoint could be acceptable if a good correlation of binding IgG and Neutralisation assays would be demonstrated. Therefore, the MAH had to show the correlation between neutralising and binding antibodies to ensure clinical relevance of the binding antibody data. The MAH has submitted the requested method correlation analysis and the result is acceptable as demonstrating a good correlation (R 2  = 0.97) between the values measured using Neutralisation and Binding assay.

In current update, an overview of results of the secondary BNT162b2 immunogenicity endpoint analyses of SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation titres for a subset of approximately 200 participants were presented.

The evaluable BNT162b2 immunogenicity population of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay subset included 100 (100%) participants in the coadministration group and 100 (100%) in the separateadministration group. The neutralising assay results from this smaller selected population agree generally with the earlier presented S-protein binding antibody results from entire evaluable immunogenicity population. The antibody titre was very high for both separate and co-administration groups. The antibody concentration was numerically higher in separate administration group compared to the coadministration group according to both serology method for this selected smaller study population. For this post-hoc analysis for small subgroup, the GMR would not meet the pre specified non-inferiority criteria for neither of the assays (lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR &gt;0.67). The result was very near to non-inferiority criteria, GMR LL 0.66 for neutralisation and 0.67 for S-binding assay. The GMRs of the S- protein binding antibody data from entire evaluable immunogenicity population did meet the pre specified non-inferiority criteria.

There will be no immunogenicity data presented from this co-administration study in SmPC as agreed earlier during II/201. The clinical impact for lower titre of neutralising antibodies in case of coadministration with SIIV is unknown.

The Phase 3 portion of this study included approximately 150 pregnant women enrolled at 24 to 34 weeks' gestation. Phase 3 proceeded after the first 200 maternal participants had been enrolled in Phase 2. Maternal participants who originally received placebo could receive BNT162b2 at the 1-month postdelivery visit.

Subjects with known HIV infection could be included if the participant had a viral load &lt;50 copies/mL and CD4count &gt;200 cells/mm3 within 6 months before Enrolment, and on stable antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months.

Enrolment in this study was terminated on 25 October 2021 due to Enrolment challenges as a result of universal recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination of pregnant women and the increased global availability of COVID-19 vaccines.

## 7.1.2. C4591024

This was a Phase 2b, open-label study with BNT162b2 in immunocompromised participants ≥18 years of age treated for NSCLC or CLL, receiving haemodialysis treatment secondary to end-stage renal disease, or receiving immunomodulator therapy for an autoimmune inflammatory disorder, and in immunocompromised participants 2 to &lt;18 years of age receiving immunomodulator therapy or who have undergone solid organ transplant (within the previous 3 months) and are on immunosuppression or who have undergone bone marrow or stem cell transplant at least 6 months prior to Enrolment.

The study evaluated a 4-dose schedule (the first 2 doses separated by 21 days), with a third dose occurring 28 days after the second dose. The fourth dose (booster) occurred 3-6 months after Dose 3*.

The dose for each of the 4 vaccinations depended upon the age of the participant at the time of vaccination, as follows:

- For participants who were &gt; 12 years of age (on the day of vaccination): at a 30-μg dose level
- For participants who were 5 to &lt;12 years of age (on the day of vaccination): at a 10-μg dose level
- For participants who were 2 to &lt;5 years of age (on the day of vaccination): at a 3-μg dose level
- In each of the cohorts &lt;18 years of age (at Visit 1), participants with the following immunocompromising conditions were recruited/enrolled:
- o Immunomodulator treatment for an autoimmune inflammatory disorder (≥10 participants in each age cohort)
- o Immunomodulator treatment after solid organ transplant (≥10 participants in each age cohort)
- o Underwent bone marrow or stem cell transplant ≥6 months (182 days) before Enrolment (≥10 participants in each age cohort)
- In the cohort that was ≥18 years of age (at Visit 1), participants with the following immunocompromising conditions were recruited/enrolled:
- o Treated for NSCLS or CLL (no participants who were receiving treatment or under observation for CLL were enrolled in Study C4591024.)
- o Were receiving haemodialysis treatment secondary to end-stage renal disease
- o Immunomodulatory treatment for an autoimmune inflammatory disorder

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

*Note that the timing of the fourth dose was determined by the investigator's discretion, taking into account factors such as the participant's underlying condition and level of immunosuppression, the evolving clinical literature, the COVID-19 incidence in the participant's geographic area, and the potential for increased reactogenicity with Dose 4 occurring earlier. Additionally, although more data are needed for COVID-19 vaccines, there is a risk of reduced immunogenicity and antibody persistence with a shorter interval between Dose 3 and Dose 4. Investigators were encouraged to weigh the risks and benefits for each participant and make an individualized decision on the timing of the third dose, provided it falls within the minimum and maximum time frames detailed above. Depending on the timing of Dose 3 and Dose 4, participants were expected to participate for up to 14 months, with a maximum of approximately 15 months

There have been 5 protocol amendments during the study. Some changes were purely administrative clarifications initially reported in PACLs. Other more important changes are listed below:

- Removal of the requirement to conduct a potential COVID-19/MIS-C convalescent visit following each COVID-19/MIS-C illness visit.
- Removal of the exploratory objective looking into viral shedding in line with the removal of the convalescent visit.
- Addition of primary and exploratory safety, tolerability, and immune response objectives for the expanded cohort of participants on active immunomodulator therapy.
- Updated Visit 5 window to allow its occurrence as early as 28 days after Visit 2 and updated wording to allow subgroup analysis of immunogenicity endpoints based on various timing of Dose 3. These changes were made to be in line with Regulatory recommendations for providing a 3rd dose of BNT162b2 to immunocompromised individuals.
- Updated procedures to allow a fourth dose (booster), reducing the window for provision of Dose 3, and allowing vaccination with the age-appropriate dose.
- Updated the number of participants in each group based on actual recruitment figures.
- Removed further blood draws for participants who have consented to PBMC sampling.

## Infant population:

A total of 167 infants were born to maternal participants in the BNT162b2 group and 168 were born to maternal participants in the placebo group. Most (86.9%) infant participants completed the 6-months-ofage follow-up visit. Withdrawal from the study was more frequently reported among infants whose mothers were randomised to placebo (17.3%) than those whose mothers were randomised to BNT162b2 (9.0%); the most frequent reasons for withdrawal during the study was withdrawal by parent/guardian and lost to follow-up. Two infant participants (1 in the BNT162b2 [pneumonia, mother was HIV positive]and 1 in the placebo group [neonatal pneumonia]) died during the study due to SAEs that were assessed as unrelated to study vaccination, and were subsequently withdrawn from the study.

The safety population for maternal participants included 173 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 173 participants in the placebo group; 2 maternal participants were excluded from the safety population because they did not receive the study intervention. Most maternal participants included in the safety population were breastfeeding, and 12 in the BNT162b2 group and 10 in the placebo group were HIVpositive.

Most (≥97.7%) maternal participants were administered Dose 1 and Dose 2 as randomised. For participants who were originally randomised to placebo, 87.4% and 85.1% received a first dose and second dose of BNT162b2, respectively, following unblinding at the 1-month postdelivery visit. In all randomised maternal participants, the majority (≥87.9%) in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups received Dose 2 in the protocol-defined window of 19 to 23 days after Dose 1. For the 152 (87.4%) maternal participants who were originally randomised to placebo and received a first dose of BNT162b2 after unblinding, the majority (127 [73.0%]) received a second dose of BNT162b2 in the protocol-defined window of 19 to 23 days after the first dose.

Infant population:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The majority of participants were White (65.4%), non-Hispanic/non-Latino (60.3%), and located in the US (48.7%) or South Africa (23.9%). The majority of infants were born ≥37 weeks to 41 weeks 6 days, and 89.3% of infant participants were breastfed. Both groups were similar with regards to HIV status (mother positive in 6-7%).

Most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity. A severe event of swelling was reported in 1 participant in the BNT162b2 group after Dose 1, and a severe event of pain at the injection site was reported in 1 participant in the same group after Dose 2. No Grade 4 local reactions were reported in either group.

Across both groups, median onset for all local reactions was between Day 1 and Day 2.5 after Dose 1 or Dose 2, and all events resolved with median durations between 1 to 2 days.

Subgroup analysis: Local reactions reported within 7 days after vaccination were evaluated by race, ethnicity, and baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. Overall, for these subgroups, local reactions were reported at higher frequencies among participants in the BNT162b2 group after both doses compared to those in the placebo group. Among vaccinated participants, no clinically meaningful differences were observed by race or ethnicity in either group. For participants with baseline negative SARS-CoV-2 status, higher frequencies of pain at the injection site were reported after each dose in both the BNT162b2 and placebo groups as compared to baseline positive participants. As several subgroups included a limited number of participants, these results should be interpreted with caution.

## Systemic Events

Most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity. In both the BNT162b2 and placebo groups, the most frequently reported severe events after any dose were fatigue (2.0% and 0.6%, respectively) and headache (1.9% and 0.6%, respectively). No Grade 4 systemic events were reported in either group.

Across both groups, median onset for all systemic events was between Day 1 and Day 4 after Dose 1 or Dose 2, and all events resolved with median durations between 1 to 4.5 days.

The reported frequencies of participants with baseline systemic events were similar for the BNT162b2 and placebo groups, with the baseline fatigue most frequently reported (29.7% and 33.8%, respectively).

Subgroup analyses: Systemic events reported within 7 days after vaccination were evaluated by race, ethnicity, and baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. Among vaccinated participants, no clinically meaningful differences were observed by race, ethnicity, or SARS-CoV-2 status in either group. As several subgroups included a limited number of participants, these results should be interpreted with caution.

## Participants Randomised to Placebo and Who Received BNT162b2 After Unblinding

Note that these participants did not use an e-diary to record local reactions or systemic events occurring within 7 days of vaccination after receipt of BNT162b2 after unblinding at 1 month postdelivery, and all such events were reported as AEs.

The frequency of AEs reported among participants who originally received placebo and then received BNT162b2 after unblinding (22.2%) was similar to that in the BNT162b2 group during the blinded followup period (23.6%), and overall the results did not suggest any meaningful differences in types of AEs reported. From vaccination with BNT162b2 to 1 month after the second dose of BNT162b2 for original placebo participants who then received BNT162b2 after unblinding, there were no reported SAEs, life-threatening AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, or deaths. Except for 1 participant, all AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Related AEs were reported in 12.5% of participants. The most frequently reported AEs in these participants unblinded at 1-month postdelivery were reactogenicity events. The frequency of AEs reported among participants who originally received placebo and then received BNT162b2 after unblinding (22.2%) was similar to that in the BNT162b2 group during the blinded follow-up period (23.6%). From vaccination with BNT162b2 to 1 month after the second dose of BNT162b2 for original placebo participants who then received BNT162b2 after unblinding, there were no reported SAEs, lifethreatening AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, or deaths. Except for 1 participant, all AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Related AEs were reported in 12.5% of participants. The most frequently reported AEs in these participants unblinded at 1-month postdelivery were reactogenicity events.

Infant Participants

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The proportions of infant participants with any AEs reported from birth to 1 month of age were similar in the BNT162b2 (35.3%) and placebo (37.1%) groups. Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity (≤6.3% were severe between both groups), and none were assessed by the investigator as related. Between both groups, SAEs were reported in ≤13.8% and life-threatening AEs were reported in and ≤3.1% of infants. One infant participant in the placebo group was withdrawn due to a fatal SAE of neonatal pneumonia that was assessed by the investigator as unrelated to study intervention. Additionally, 1 infant born to an HIVpositive maternal participant in the BNT162b2 group was withdrawn due to a fatal SAE of pneumonia that was also assessed as unrelated to study intervention by the investigator.

## Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term

## Maternal Participants

AEs in maternal participants from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 that were most frequently reported for the BNT162b2 group were in the SOCs of pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions (9.3%), infections and infestations (5.0%), and gastrointestinal disorders (4.3%); in the placebo group, AEs were reported in these SOCs for pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions (9.2%), gastrointestinal disorders (6.1%), infections and infestations (2.5%), and blood and lymphatic system disorders (2.5%), respectively. The frequency of AEs reported by PT was generally similar between the BNT162b2 and placebo groups. Few Tier 2 AEs 1  were reported in maternal participants from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2. In the BNT162b2 group, most Tier 2 AEs were reported in 2 participants each.

## Participants Randomised to Placebo and Who Received BNT162b2 After Unblinding

In maternal participants originally randomised to placebo, who received BNT162b2 after unblinding at 1month postdelivery, AEs reported from the first dose of BNT162b2 to 1 month after the second dose of BNT162b2 were most frequently in the SOCs of general disorders and administration site conditions (13.2%), infections and infestations (6.9%), and nervous system disorders (5.6%). The few AEs reported in &gt;1 participant was primarily reactogenicity events; the most frequently reported were injection site pain (9.0%) and headache (4.9%).

## Infant Participants

AEs in infant participants from birth to 1 month of age that were most frequently reported for the BNT162b2 group were in the SOCs of pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions (16.7%) and congenital, familial and genetic disorders (10.3%); in the placebo group, AEs were reported in these SOCs for 19.5% and 5.0%, respectively. In the BNT162b2 group, most AEs were reported in 1 participant each. The most frequently reported AE in the BNT162b2 group was jaundice neonatal (12.2%), which was reported similarly in the placebo group (10.7%).

Tier 2 AEs were reported at similar frequencies between the BNT162b2 and placebo groups (53 and 61 participants, respectively). In the BNT162b2 group, most Tier 2 AEs were reported in 1 to 3 participants each.

## Infants Born to HIV-Positive Participants

There were few infants born to HIV-positive maternal participants with AEs reported during the study; most were born to mothers in the placebo group. None of the AEs were assessed as related. One infant born to an HIV-positive participant maternal participant in the BNT162b2 group had a fatal SAE of pneumonia that was assessed by the investigator as not related.

Neither of the two related AEs were SAEs or AEs which led to withdrawal.

In infant participants, none of the AEs reported from birth to 1 month of age were assessed as related to study intervention by the investigator.

## Immediate Adverse Events

## Maternal Participants

In maternal participants, there were no immediate AEs reported within 30 minutes after receiving Dose 1. After Dose 2, 1 participant in the placebo group reported an immediate AE of injection site pain.

## Participants Randomised to Placebo and Who Received BNT162b2 After Unblinding

In maternal participants who were originally randomised to placebo and then received BNT162b2 after unblinding at 1-month postdelivery, there were no immediate AEs reported after the first or second dose of BNT162b2.

## Severe and Life-Threatening Adverse Events

## Maternal Participants

Severe AEs were reported by 7 participants (4.3%) in the BNT162b2 group and 8 participants (4.9%) in the placebo group from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2. In the BNT162b2 group, severe AEs were mostly reported by 1 participant each and were most frequently reported (≤2 participants) in the SOCs of pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions and infections and infestations. The few severe AEs that were SAEs were similar in frequency between groups (5 [3.1%] participants in the BNT162b2 group, 4 [2.5%] participants in the placebo group), and none were assessed by the investigator as related.

## Infant Participants

Severe AEs were reported by 5 participants (3.2%) in the BNT162b2 group and 10 participants (6.3%) in the placebo group from birth to 1 month of age. In the BNT162b2 group, severe AEs were reported in 1 participant each and were most frequently reported (≤3 participants) in the SOCs of congenital, familial and genetic disorders and pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions. The few severe AEs that were

SAEs were similar in frequency between groups (5 [3.2%] participants in the BNT162b2 group, 8 [5.0%] participants in the placebo group), and none were assessed by the investigator as related.

## Deaths

## Maternal Participants

There were no deaths in maternal participants.

## Infant Participants

One infant born at 32 weeks and 3 days gestational age, to a maternal participant in the placebo group, died at 7 days of age due to an SAE of neonatal pneumonia; the event duration was 7 days, and was assessed as not related by the investigator. Additionally, one infant born at 40 weeks gestational age, to an HIV-positive maternal participant in the BNT162b2 group, died at 124 days of age due to an SAE of pneumonia; the event duration was 6 days, and was investigator-assessed as not related.

## Serious Adverse Events

## Maternal Participants

For SAEs reported in maternal participants from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2, the proportions were similar in the BNT162b2 (5.6%) and placebo (5.5%) groups; none were assessed by the investigator as related.

## Participants Randomised to Placebo and Who Received BNT162b2 After Unblinding

In maternal participants originally randomised to placebo, who received BNT162b2 after unblinding at 1month postdelivery, from the first dose of BNT162b2 to 1 month after the second dose of BNT162b2 there were no SAEs reported.

## Infant Participants

From birth to 1 month of age, SAEs were reported in 12.2% and 13.8% of infant participants in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups, respectively; none were assessed by the investigator as related.

From birth to 6 months of age, SAEs were reported in 13.5% and 15.1% of infant participants in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups, respectively; none was assessed by the investigator as related. In the BNT162b2 group, SAEs were most frequently reported in the SOCs of pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions (5.8%) and congenital, familial and genetic disorders (5.8%), which were reported at similar frequencies n the placebo group (3.1% and 3.1%, respectively). By PT, all SAEs in the BNT162b2 group were reported in ≤3 participants each, except for jaundice neonatal (7 participants). In the placebo group, an SAE of neonatal pneumonia, assessed by the investigator as not related, was fatal.

## Infants Born to HIV-Positive Participants

From birth to 6 months of age, SAEs were reported in 9.1% and 22.2% of infants born to HIV-positive participants in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups, respectively, none were assessed by the investigator as related. One infant born to an HIV-positive participant in the BNT162b2 group had a fatal SAE of pneumonia that was assessed by the investigator as not related to study vaccine.

## Discontinuations from Study Due to Adverse Events

## Maternal Participants

There were no maternal participants who were withdrawn due to AEs.

## Infant Participants

In the placebo group, 1 infant was withdrawn due to a fatal SAE of neonatal pneumonia that was assessed by the investigator as not related. Additionally, 1 infant born to an HIV-positive participant maternal participant in the BNT162b2 group was withdrawn due to a fatal SAE of pneumonia that was assessed by the investigator as not related.

## Adverse Events of Special Interest

## Maternal Participants

No protocol-defined AESIs were reported in maternal participants during the study (before or after unblinding).

## Infant Participants

Numerical differences between infant participants with reported congenital anomalies were observed between groups, with anomalies reported in 8 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 2 in the placebo group. None of the events were assessed by the investigator as related. All participants with reported AESIs were breastfed.

## Other Significant Adverse Events

## Maternal Participants

- Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity: In the BNT162b2 group, there was 1 participant with hypersensitivity (allergy) of moderate severity that was reported 12 days after Dose 2, which was assessed by the investigator as not related to study intervention, and resolved within 3 days.
- Bell's palsy: There were no reported AEs of Bell's palsy in either vaccine group.
- Appendicitis: There were no reported AEs of appendicitis in either vaccine group.
- Lymphadenopathy: In the placebo group, there was 1 participant with lymphadenopathy (left axillary) of mild severity that was reported 2 days after Dose 1, which was assessed by the investigator as related, and resolved within 2 days. There were no reported AEs of axillary pain, lymph node pain, or lymphadenitis.

## Other Safety Evaluations

## Pregnancy Outcomes - Maternal Participants

Most maternal participants delivered via the vaginal route (69.0% in BNT162b2 and 66.1% in placebo), and fewer had an emergency Cesarean delivery (7.7% in BNT162b2 and 10.7%). For 1 HIV-positive participant in the BNT162b2 group, the outcome was a stillbirth.

## Reactogenicity

## Local Reactions

Across all age groups, the majority of local reactions were mild or moderate in severity. No severe or Grade 4 local reactions were reported.

## Participants 2 to &lt; 5 Years of Age

Frequencies of any local reaction (redness, swelling, pain at the injection site) within 7 days after each dose of BNT162b2 3 μg were similar (Dose 1: 18.9%, Dose 2: 14.3%, Dose 3: 14.3%, Dose 4: 21.1%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local reaction, and the frequency was similar after each Dose (Dose 1: 16.2%, Dose 2: 14.3%, Dose 3: 14.3%, Dose 4: 15.8%).

Across all groups, the median onset for any local reaction after receiving BNT162b2 3 μg was Day 1 for Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3, and was Day 2 for Dose 4. Local reactions resolved within a median duration of 1 days, 1 days, 1-6 days, and 1-2 days after onset for Dose 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. After Dose 3, one participant in the solid organ transplant group reported swelling with a median duration of 6 days.

## Participants 5 to &lt; 12 Years of Age

Frequencies of any local reaction (redness, swelling, pain at the injection site) within 7 days after each dose of BNT162b2 10 μg were similar (Dose 1: 66.2%, Dose 2: 63.1%, Dose 3: 52.5%, Dose 4: 54.3%). Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local reaction, and the frequency was similar after each Dose (Dose 1: 61.5%, Dose 2: 60.0%, Dose 3: 49.2%, Dose 4: 54.3%.

Across all groups, the median onset for any local reaction after receiving BNT162b2 10 μg was Day 1.0 for Dose 1, Dose 2, Dose 3, and Dose 4. Local reactions resolved within a median duration of 1-2.5 days, 1-2 days, 1-4 days, and 2-3 days after onset for Dose 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

## Participants 12 to &lt; 18 Years of Age

Frequencies of any local reaction (redness, swelling, pain at the injection site) within 7 days after each dose of BNT162b2 30 μg were similar (Dose 1: 80.0%, Dose 2: 80.0%, Dose 3: 71.4%, Dose 4: 75.0%). Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local reaction, and the frequency was similar after each Dose (Dose 1: 73.3%, Dose 2: 73.3%, Dose 3: 71.4%, Dose 4: 62.5%).

Across all groups, the median onset for any local reaction after receiving BNT162b2 30 μg was Day 2, Day 1, Day 1, and Day 2, for Dose 1, Dose 2, Dose 3, and Dose 4, respectively. Local reactions resolved within a median duration of 2-3.5 days, 2-3 days, 4.5-7 days, and 1-5 days after onset for Dose 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Duration of local reactions was observed to be marginally higher in the immunomodulatory group, however, considering the small number of subjects, this cannot be considered clinically significant.

## Participants ≥18 Years of Age

Frequencies of any local reaction (redness, swelling, pain at the injection site) within 7 days after each dose of BNT162b2 30 μg were similar (Dose 1: 85.7%, Dose 2: 71.4%, Dose 3: 60.0%, Dose 4: 75.0%).

Note: The mumber above each bar denotes the numbei ofpartieipants (N) in each vaccine group who provided nt least 1 yes or no response for the specifed 1eaction within 7 days of the specified dose. This is the denominator used to calculate the percentages shown.

One participant (20.0%) in the immunomodulatory therapy group reported a fever of ≥38.0°C to 38.4°C after Dose 2. No participants reported fever ≥40.0°C. Antipyretic or pain medication use was reported by 4 participants (57.1%) after any Dose.

The median onset for systemic events was Day 1, Day 2, Day 1, Day 2 for Dose 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Systemic events resolved within a median duration of 1-5 days, 1-3.5 days, 1-8 days, and 1-5 days after onset for Dose 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

## Adverse Events

## Summary of Adverse Events

The AE profile after vaccination of children 2 to &lt;18 years of age mostly reflected reactogenicity events or unrelated infections typically observed in a paediatric population with immunocompromising conditions, with a low incidence of severe AEs. The AE profile after vaccination of adults ≥18 years of age mostly reflected reactogenicity events or unrelated infections typically observed in an adult population with immunocompromising conditions, with a low incidence of severe AEs. Across all age groups, the majority of local and systemic reactions were mild or moderate in severity. No Grade 4 systemic reactions were reported. The majority of AEs were in the infections and infestations SOC, and all AESIs were likely related to participant's underlying condition. There were no deaths, no SAEs assessed as related by the investigator, no life-threatening AEs, and no AEs leading to withdrawal.

Summary of Adverse Events from Dose 1 to 1 Month After Dose 2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AEs were reported by 14 participants (37.8%) who were 2 to &lt;5 years, 15 participants (23.1%) who were 5 to &lt;12 years of age, 2 participants (13.3%) who were 12 to &lt;18 years of age, and 1 participant (14.3%) who was ≥18 years of age.

- 4 participants (10.8%) who were 2 to &lt;5 years of age reported nonserious AEs that were assessed as related, and they were all severe.
- 5 participants (7.7%) who were 5 to &lt;12 years of age reported nonserious AEs that were assessed as related.
- 1 participant (14.3%) who was 12 to &lt;18 years of age in the stem cell transplant group who reported nonserious AEs that were assessed as related.
- 1 participant (14.3%) ≥18 years of age reported a severe, nonserious AE that was not assessed as related.

## Summary of Adverse Events from Dose 3 to 1 Month After Dose 3

AEs were reported by 9 participants (25.7%) who were 2 to &lt;5 years of age, 8 participants (12.9%) who were 5 to &lt;12 years of age, and 2 participants (14.3%) who were 12 to &lt;18 years of age. No participants ≥18 years of age reported an AE.

2 participants (5.7%) who were 2 to &lt;5 years of age reported nonserious AEs that were assessed as related. SAEs were reported by 4 participants (11.4%) in the safety population all 4 participants (26.7%) were in the solid organ transplant group. Two of the SAEs were classified as severe.

3 participants (4.8%) who were 5 to &lt;12 years of age reported nonserious AEs that were assessed as related. There was 1 participant (5.9%) in the immunomodulatory group who reported a severe SAE.

The participant who was 12 to &lt;18 years of age in the stem cell transplant group reported nonserious AEs that were assessed as related.

## Summary of Adverse Events from Dose 4 to 1 Month After Dose 4

AEs were reported by 2 participants (10.5%) who were 2 to &lt;5 years of age and 7 participants (15.2%) who were 5 to &lt;12 years of age. No AEs were reported by participants who were &gt;12 years of age.

1 participant (5.3%) who was 2 to &lt;5 years of age in the immunomodulatory therapy group reported nonserious AEs that were assessed as related to study intervention by the investigator.

All participants who were 5 to &lt;12 years of age who reported AEs were in the solid organ transplant group. There was 1 participant (5.3%) who reported a nonserious AE that was assessed as related.

## Incidence Rate of Confirmed COVID-19 Cases After Dose 1

Overall, there was a small number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (n=45) reported by participants after Dose 1 to end of study.

## Participants 2 to &lt;5 Years of Age

In participants who received BNT162b2 3 μg, the IR of first COVID-19 occurrence after Dose 1, from 7 days after Dose 3, and from 7 days after Dose 4 in the immunomodulatory therapy group was 663.287, 633.565, and 751.543 per 1000 person-years of follow up, respectively. The IR of first COVID-19 occurrence after Dose 1 and from 7 days after Dose 3 in the solid organ transplant group was 492.251 and 181.266 per 1000 person-years of follow up, respectively, and no case occurred from 7 days after Dose 4. The IR of first COVID-19 occurrence after Dose 1 in the stem cell transplant group was 234.737 per 1000 person-years of follow up, and no case occurred after 7 days after Dose 3 onwards.

## Participants 5 to &lt;12 Years of Age

In participants who received BNT162b2 10 μg, the IR of first COVID-19 occurrence after Dose 1, from 7 days after Dose 3, and from 7 days after Dose 4 in the immunomodulatory therapy group was 952.660, 770.895, and 519.559 per 1000 person-years of follow up, respectively.

There was a separation in the KM curves between the immunomodulatory therapy and the other two disease groups, which potentially corresponds to the lower GMTs observed in the immunomodulatory therapy disease group.

## Participants 12 to &lt;18 Years of Age

In participants who received BNT162b2 30 μg, the IR of first COVID-19 occurrence after Dose 1 and from 7 days after Dose 3, in the immunomodulatory therapy group was 861.947 and 602.226 per 1000 person-years of follow up, respectively. No case occurred in solid organ transplant group. The IR of first COVID-19 occurrence after Dose 1 and from 7 days after Dose 3, in the stem cell transplant group was 422.499 and 616.976 per 1000 person-years of follow up, respectively. No case occurred in solid organ transplant group.

## Participants ≥18 Years of Age

In participants who received BNT162b2 30 μg, the IR of first COVID-19 occurrence after Dose 1, from 7 days after Dose 3, from 7 days after Dose 4, in the immunomodulatory therapy group was 697.708 and 1144.984, and 3397.674 per 1000 person-years of follow up, respectively.

## Surveillance of COVID-19 Cases

Confirmed COVID-19 Cases, Severe COVID-19 Illness, and MIS-C

There were few episodes of confirmed COVID-19 cases (n=45) reported by participants across all age groups throughout the study and primarily represented mild to moderate illness.

One participant 5 to &lt;12 years of age reported COVID-19 that met 1 or more severe illness criteria (protocol-defined) and no cases of MIS-C were reported.

## 7.3. Discussion

## C4591015

This report presents the final safety data from the phase 3 study C4591015 where pregnant women were randomised to receive either 30 μg of BNT162b2 (n=174) or placebo (n=174) administered in 2 doses, 21 days apart at 24 to 34 weeks' gestation. HIV positive subjects could be included if they were on stable antiretroviral therapy and a viral load of &lt;50 copies/mL. These subjects could therefore not be seen as immunocompromised. The study was limited in size due to the national recommended COVID-19 vaccination of pregnant women.

The reactogenicity profile was in line with previous results from non-pregnant adult subjects. The reactions were transient and most of them were mild to moderate at intensity. The most reported local reaction was pain at injection site (83% dose1; 75% dose2). The most frequently reported systemic events were fatigue (50%) and headache (34-41%). Fever was reported in 1-4% (dose 1 and 2 respectively). Most reported AEs were related to reactogenicity. The frequency of participants reporting any SAE was low and comparable to what was reported in the placebo group (5.6% and 5.5%, respectively). Two related AEs were reported among the maternal participants receiving BNT162b2 (tachypnoea and injection site pain). None of the infants experienced AEs related to maternal vaccination. No new safety concern was identified in this limited study population.

## C4591024

This report presents the final safety data of the phase 2b study C4591024 that enrolled a total of 124 immunocompromised participants aged 2 to &lt;5 years (n=37), 5-&lt;12 years (n=65) 12-&lt;18 years (n=15) and ≥ 18 years (n=7). The study evaluated a 4-dose schedule (the first 2 doses separated by 21 days), with a third dose occurring 28 days after the second dose. The fourth dose was administered 3-6 months after Dose 3, at the discretion of the investigator. The dose for each of the 4 vaccinations depended on the age of participants at time of vaccination (&gt;12 years of age: 30-µg dose, 5 to &lt;12 years of age: 10µg dose, 2 to &lt;5 years: 3-µg dose).

Most of the reactogenicity evens were transient and mild to moderate at intensity. Children aged 2-&lt;5 years old were presented with a mild reactogenicity profile with a low frequency of both local and systemic events (&lt;21%), similar as for non-immunocompromised subjects presented in other studies. Children aged 5 to &lt; 12 years that constituted the largest age group (n=65) in this limited study reported local reactions (most common pain at injection site: 53-63%) and systemic events where fatigue (4661%). Fever was reported in 1,5-12%, none had fever &gt;40 o C. Among the subjects ≥12 years old (n=22), the reactogenicity profile are in line with the data that has been presented previously for nonimmunocompromised subjects. The majority of AEs were in the infections and infestations SOC, and all AESIs were likely related to participant's underlying condition. There were no deaths, no SAEs assessed

as related by the investigator, no life-threatening AEs, and no AEs leading to withdrawal. No new safety concerns were identified in this limited study population of immunocompromised subjects.

## Question 3

In study C4591024 there was about 20% of participants in age group 5-&lt;18 with unknown baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. The reason is unknown and need a clarification.

## Summary of the MAH's response

There are 2 age groups within the 5-&lt;18 years category which comprise of 5-&lt;12-year-olds and 12&lt;18-year-olds. Considering the total evaluable immunogenicity population the following table demonstrates that the 5-&lt;18 age bracket contains the majority of missing baseline SARS-CoV-2 results as the 5- &lt;12 years age group was the highest enrolling group (n = 56), and therefore also had the highest number of missing results (n=14).

| Age Group (years)   |   Total Number of Participants - Dose 3 Evaluable Immunogenicity Population (N) | Number of Missing Baseline SARS- CoV-2 Status, n (%)   |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 2-<5                |                                                                              26 | 3 (11.5)                                               |
| 5-<12               |                                                                              56 | 14 (25.0)                                              |
| 12-<18              |                                                                              11 | 3 (27.3)                                               |
| ≥18                 |                                                                               4 | 0                                                      |
| Total               |                                                                              97 | 20 (20.6)                                              |

As the total denominator of the study is small (N=124), and that of the evaluable immunogenicity population is further reduced (n=97), small fluctuations in the number of participants with a missing result would lead to large changes in the percentage.

The baseline COVID status was unknown for some participants due to the analyses not being able to be performed (e.g. blood sample/swab not taken, indeterminate result).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Assessment of the MAH's response:

The Applicant explained that absence of the baseline sample (blood or nasal swab) or unclear test result caused the 'unknown baseline Covid-19 status' label for about 20 % of participants.

## Conclusion:

Issue solved

- [x] Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly

- [ ] No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance
