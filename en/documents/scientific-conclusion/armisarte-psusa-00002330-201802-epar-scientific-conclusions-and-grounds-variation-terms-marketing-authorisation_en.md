## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pemetrexed, the scientific conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:

During a periodic regulatory review of the use of pemetrexed a number of cases describing pigmentation disorders has been described with a common frequency. Data from the originator medicinal product identified 141 cases of pigmentation disorders such as hyperpigmentation (n=48) and pigmentation disorders NEC (n=80) corresponding mostly to blackish or increased pigmentation, positive de-challenge and positive re-challenge in a number of cases was also described. This is further supported with data from a clinical study. As a result there is sufficient evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the use of pemetrexed and hyperpigmentation. Section 4.8 of the SmPC is being updated accordingly together with consequential changes in the Package leaflet.

A number of cases describing cellulitis, pseudocellulitis, dermatitis and dermo-hypodermitis have been reported with an unknown frequency. In the data from the originator product, 91 cases of cellulitis, 42 of dermatitis, 13 cases of dermo-hypodermitis, and 3 cases of pseudocellulitis were identified. As a result there is sufficient evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the use of pemetrexed and infectious and non-infectious disorders of the dermis, the hypodermis and/or the subcutaneous tissue including acute bacterial dermo-hypodermitis, cellulitis, pseudocellulitis and dermatitis. Section 4.8 of the SmPC is being updated accordingly together with consequential changes in the Package leaflet.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pemetrexed the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pemetrexed is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
