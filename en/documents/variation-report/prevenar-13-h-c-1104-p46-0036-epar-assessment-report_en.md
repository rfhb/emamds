## I. INTRODUCTION

On, March 1, 2010 the MAH submitted completed paediatric studies for Prevenar 13, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric studies do not influence the benefit risk for Prevenar 13 and that there is no consequential regulatory action.

## II. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study(ies)

13vPnC contains saccharides from pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F individually conjugated to nontoxic diphtheria toxin cross-reactive material 197 (CRM197). The vaccine is formulated to contain 2.2 μg of each saccharide, except for 4.4 μg of 6B per 0.5-mL dose. The final formulation contains 5 mM succinate buffer, 0.02% polysorbate 80, with 0.125 mg of aluminium as aluminium phosphate per 0.5-mL dose.

## Clinical aspects

## 1. Introduction

Wyeth  has  developed  Prevenar  13,  a  13-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  (13vPnC),  as  a successor  to  the  currently  registered  vaccine,  Prevenar,  for  use  in  infants  and  young  children  to prevent pneumococcal disease (invasive pneumococcal disease [IPD], nonbacteremic pneumonia, and acute  otitis  media  [AOM])  caused  by  the  13  pneumococcal  serotypes  contained  in  the  vaccine. Prevenar is a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPnC) that contains serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F. In addition to these serotypes, 13vPnC contains serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A.

The MAH submitted final reports for:

Study  6096A1-3003: A Phase 3, Open-Label Trial evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity  of  a  13-valent  Pneumococcal  Conjugate  Vaccine  in  Healthy  Infants  in  Japan.  Final infant and toddler report.

Study  6096A1-3008 :  A  Phase  3,  Randomized,  Active-Controlled,  Doubleblind  Trial  Evaluating  the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Infants Given With Routine Pediatric Vaccinations in Canada Final infant and toddler report.

Studies 6096A1-3003 and 6096A1-3008 are part of the global clinical development program for the use  of  Prevenar  13  in  infants  and  were  conducted  to  support  licensure  in  Japan  and  in  Canada, respectively.

## 2. Clinical studies

Study  6096A1-3003: A Phase 3, Open-Label Trial evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity  of  a  13-valent  Pneumococcal  Conjugate  Vaccine  in  Healthy  Infants  in  Japan.  Final infant and toddler report.

## Description

-  Methods
-  Objective(s)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  the  immune  response  to  the  13  pneumococcal conjugates  (1,  3,  4,  5,  6A,  6B,  7F,  9V,  14,  18C,  19A,  19F,  and  23F)  induced  by  13vPnC  when measured 1 month after the infant series.

The safety objective was to evaluate the acceptability of the safety profile of 13vPnC as measured by the incidence rates of local reactions, systemic events, and adverse events (AEs).

Secondary objectives were as follows:

-  To assess the immune response to the 13 pneumococcal conjugates (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) induced by 13vPnC when measured 1 month after the toddler dose.
-  To evaluate the comparability/superiority of immunogenicity data after the infant series and after  the  toddler  dose  between  this  study  in  Japanese  infants  (6096A1-3003-JA)  and  the pivotal licensure study in the United States (6096A1-004).
-  Study design

This  was  an  open-label,  single-group,  multicenter  trial  to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability,  and immunogenicity  of  13vPnC  administered  SC  to  Japanese  infants.  No  concomitant  vaccines  were administered.

##  Study population /Sample size

Approximately 165 subjects were to participate in this study at 20 to 30 sites to achieve a total of 140 evaluable subjects.

-  Treatments

All subjects were to be vaccinated with open-label 13vPnC in a schedule that included a 3-dose infant series  and  a  toddler  (booster)  dose.  The  protocol  stated  that  it  was  preferable  for  infants  to  be vaccinated at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. However, the first vaccination (dose 1) could be given at any time between 2 and 6 months of age, with dose 2 given at least 28 days after dose 1, dose 3 given at least 28 days after dose 2, and with the infant series being completed before 12 months of age. The toddler dose could be administered at any time between 12 and 15 months of age, but at least 60 days after dose 3.

##  Outcomes/endpoints

Blood samples (5 mL) were to be obtained from all subjects at 4 timepoints: before dose 1, one month (28 to 42 days) after dose 3, before the toddler dose, and one month (28 to 42 days) after the toddler dose. For all subjects and for each of the 4 blood samples, serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations were to be determined for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes.

Parent(s)/legal  guardian(s)  were  asked  to  monitor  and  record  in  an  electronic  diary  (e-diary)  the subject's local reactions and systemic events (including the use of antipyretic medication to treat and prevent symptoms) for 7 days after each vaccination. AEs were to be collected and recorded on the CRF based on ancillary information recorded by the parents/legal guardians in a paper diary, clinical evaluation during a study visit, and verbal questioning of the parent/legal guardian about the child's health since the last visit. AEs were collected from the signing of the ICF to visit 4 (the visit for the postinfant series blood draw) and from visit 5 (toddler dose) to visit 6. At visit 5 any newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions or serious adverse events (SAEs) since visit 4 were to be recorded. All SAEs were recorded from the signing of the ICF to visit 6.

##  Statistical Methods

The primary endpoint for each of the pneumococcal serotypes was the proportion of subjects achieving a  serotype-specific  IgG  concentration  ≥0.35  μg/mL  measured  1  month  after  the  infant  series.  This choice of endpoints was  based on the World Health Organization (WHO)  guideline for the pneumococcal serotypes.

The  secondary  endpoints  for  each  of  the  pneumococcal  serotypes  were  the  proportion  of  subjects achieving a serotype-specific IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL after the toddler dose, and the serotypespecific  geometric  mean  IgG  concentrations  measured  1  month  after  the  infant  series,  before  the toddler dose, and 1 month after the toddler dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The comparison of interest was to evaluate the comparability of immunogenicity data 1 month after the infant series and 1 month after the toddler dose between this study in Japanese infants (6096A13003) and the pivotal licensure study in the United States (6096A1-004).

Unless specified otherwise, the following analyses were performed for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes, using data for both time points (infant series and toddler dose) and for both the evaluable immunogenicity populations and the all-available immunogenicity populations:

##  Proportion of Subjects Achieving Specified Concentrations of IgG

These  analyses  were  performed  for  the  protocol-specified  level  of  ≥0.35  μg/mL  and  also  for  the additional level of ≥0.15 μg/mL, which was specified in the SAP.

Values  for  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  antibody  concentrations  ≥0.35  μg/mL  in  this  study (3003) were compared with reference values from the pivotal US licensure study (004). For each of the pneumococcal serotypes, exact, unconditional, 2-sided 95% CIs on the difference in proportions (study 3003 - study 004) were computed using the procedure of Chan and Zhang, and using the standardized test statistic and gamma = 0.000001.

##  Geometric Mean Antibody Concentrations

The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of serotype-specific IgG was calculated for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes at 4 timepoints: before and after the infant series, and before and after the toddler dose. Each concentration was logarithmically transformed for analysis. Two (2)-sided 95% CIs were constructed by back transformation of the CIs for the mean of the logarithmically transformed assay results computed using the Student t distribution.

Values for  IgG  GMCs from this study (3003) were compared with values from the pivotal US study (004).  For  each  of  the  13  serotypes,  the  ratio  of  the  GMCs  (geometric  mean  ratio,  GMR)  was calculated, and the 95% CI was computed using the Student t distribution for the mean difference of the measures on the log scale (the GMC from study 3003 relative to the reference value from study 004).

##  Geometric Mean Fold Rise in Antibody Concentrations

The geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) in the concentration of serotype-specific IgG was calculated for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes using data from the determinations made before the toddler dose and after the toddler dose. The GMFRs with 95% CIs were computed using the logarithmically transformed assay results and the Student t distribution.

In addition, the GMFRs from this study were compared with those from study 004. The ratio of the GMFRs and the corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated. The CIs were computed using the Student t distribution for the mean difference of the measures on the logarithmic scale (the value from study 3003 relative to the value from study 004). The mean difference of the log-transformed results is equivalent to the mean of the ratio of the logarithmic scale: log (x/y) = (log x) - (log y).

##  Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves

Results for IgG concentrations are presented graphically using reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs). Only data for the evaluable immunogenicity populations are presented in RCDCs. Separate RCDCs were prepared for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes, for both the postinfant series and posttoddler dose determinations. To provide for comparison of data between studies, RCDCs for both study 3003 and study 004 are displayed on the same graph.

##  Safety analyses

The safety endpoints were AEs, local reactions, and systemic events, including fever and the use of antipyretic  medications  to  treat  and  prevent  symptoms.  Fever  was  defined  as  axillary  temperature ≥37.5°C.

The incidences of local reactions, systemic events, and AEs were summarized separately for each dose of study vaccine (dose 1, dose 2, dose 3, and the toddler dose). AEs were also summarized for any time during the infant series (dose 1, 2, or 3).

The proportions of subjects with local reactions and systemic events reported on any day within the 7day  period  after  each  vaccination  were  summarized  for  each  type  of  event.  These  data  were  also summarized for just the first 4 days after vaccination, in order to provide data for comparison with data from others studies in which e-diary data were collected for only 4 days after each vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Local reactions were also summarized according to severity (mild, moderate, severe); and summary statistics for the duration (in days) of both local reactions and systemic events were reported.

Summary tabulations of AEs were produced separately for solicited (e-diary) AEs and for unsolicited AEs, and additional tabulations are provided for all AEs combined (both solicited and unsolicited). For summarization,  AEs  were  categorized  according  to  the  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA).  AE  summaries  show,  for  each  MedDRA  preferred  term,  the  number  and  percentage  of subjects experiencing at least 1 event and the number of events. SAEs were summarized for the infant series and the toddler dose, rather than for each vaccination separately. Additional summaries by AE severity and by relationship to study vaccine were also produced.

##  Results

##  Recruitment/ Number analysed

Approximately 165 subjects were to participate in this study, per protocol. A total of 193 subjects were screened and enrolled, and written informed consent was provided for all subjects. All 193 subjects received  dose  1,  and  190  (98.4%)  received  both  dose  2  and  dose  3.  Five  subjects  (2.6%)  were withdrawn from the study during the infant series, while 188 (97.4%) completed the infant series.

Three subjects (1.6%) were withdrawn from the study after completing the infant series but before receiving the toddler dose. A total of 185 subjects (95.9%) were vaccinated at the toddler dose, and all but 1 of these subjects completed the toddler dose.

-  Demographics and other baseline characteristics

All subjects were Japanese, and 51.8% were male. The mean age at enrollment was 3.7 months, and the mean weight at enrollment was 6.7 kg. Demographic characteristics for the 176  subjects in the evaluable  infant  immunogenicity  population  in  study  3003  were  similar  to  those  for  all  enrolled subjects. For these subjects, the mean age at dose 1 was 3.7 months, mean age at dose 2 was 5.1 months, and the mean age at dose 3 was 6.7 months. For the 178 subjects in the evaluable toddler immunogenicity population,  the  mean  age  at  the  toddler  dose  was  12.6  months.  In  comparison,  in study 004, the mean age was 2.1 months at dose 1, 4.1 months at dose 2, and 6.1 months at dose 3.

##  Immunogenicity results

## Infant dose

## Proportion of Subjects Achieving Prespecified Antibody Levels

In  study  3003,  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  pneumococcal  antibody  concentrations  ≥0.35 µg/mL 1 month after the infant series was 97.2% or higher for all 13 pneumococcal serotypes (Table 9-3). In study 004, the proportion of responders was 87.3% or higher for all serotypes except serotype 3,  for  which  the  proportion  of  responders  was  63.5%.  The  proportion  of  responders  was  higher  in study  3003  than  in  study  004  for  all  serotypes  except  serotype  19F  (for  which  the  proportion  was 97.2% in study 3003 and 98.0% in study 004), and the difference between the studies was 11.0% or less for all serotypes except serotype 3 (difference of 36.5%). (Table 9-3). Results for the all-available infant immunogenicity population were similar to those observed for the evaluable infant population.

## Proportion of Subjects Achieving an Additional Prespecified Antibody Level

In analyses of data for the additional antibody level of ≥0.15 µg/mL, the proportion of responders 1 month  after  the  infant  series  in  study  3003  was  100%  for  all  serotypes  except  for  serotype  19F (98.9%)  and  serotype  23F  (98.3%);  and  in  study  004  the  proportion  of  responders  was  92.4%  or higher for all serotypes. The difference between the studies was greatest for serotype 3 (difference of 7.6%) and serotype 6B (difference of 6.0%).

## Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves

RCDCs showing the distribution of IgG responses for each of the 13 serotypes after the infant series were  provided in the clinical study report. For all 13 serotypes, the RCDCs were higher along most of the curve for study 3003 as compared with study 004.

## Pneumococcal IgG Geometric Mean Concentrations

In study 3003, GMCs for the 13 serotypes 1 month after the infant series ranged from 2.57µg/mL for serotype  23F  to  6.97  µg/mL  for  serotype  19A,  with  the  exception  of  serotype  14,  for  which  the concentration  was  14.69  µg/mL,  more  than  twice  that  for  any  other  serotype  (Table  9-4).  IgG concentrations were lower in study 004 for all 13 serotypes, ranging from 0.49 µg/mL for serotype 3 to 2.57 µg/mL for serotype 7F, with serotype 14 again being an outlier, with a serum concentration of 4.74 µg/mL. GMRs comparing data for study 3003 versus study 004 ranged from 1.72 for serotype 6A to 5.88 for serotype 3. Antibody GMCs for the 13 serotypes before the infant series ranged from a low of 0.03 µg/mL for serotype 4 to a high of 0.35 µg/mL for serotype 19A.

## Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves

RCDCs  for  the  posttoddler  dose  time  point  were  provided  in  the  clinical  study  report.  For  all  13 serotypes, the RCDCs were higher along most of the curve for study 3003 as compared with study 004.

## Pneumococcal IgG Geometric Mean Concentrations Before the Toddler Dose

In study 3003, before the toddler dose, GMCs for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes ranged from 0.73 µg/mL for serotype 3 to 5.25 µg/mL for serotype 14 (Table 9-6). GMCs were lower in study 004 for all 13 serotypes, ranging from 0.15 µg/mL for serotype 3 to 1.89 µg/mL for serotype 14. GMRs ranged from 2.37 for serotype 23F to 4.84 for serotype 3.

## After the Toddler dose

In study 3003, 1 month after the toddler dose, GMCs ranged from 2.06 µg/mL for serotype 3 to 16.33 µg/mL for serotype 14 (Table 9-7). For all serotypes, GMCs 1 month after the toddler dose were higher than GMCs observed before the toddler dose, demonstrating the booster effect of the toddler dose. Furthermore, GMCs were higher after the toddler dose than after the infant series for all serotypes except serotype 3. In study 004, GMCs 1 month after the toddler dose ranged from 0.94 µg/mL for serotype 3 to 11.53 µg/mL for serotype 6B. For all serotypes, IgG concentrations were higher in study 3003 than  in  study  004,  with  GMRs  (study  3003  relative  to  study  004)  ranging  from  1.27  to  2.60 (Table 9-7).

Assessor's comment: The GMCs for serotype 3 were lower after the toddler doser than after the infant dose  in  study  6096A1-3003.  However,  the  titres  had  decreased  between  the  third  infant  dose  and before the toddler dose, which indicates that there was indeed a response to the toddler dose. The slightly lower response therefore does not seem to be the result of immune hyporesponsiveness, but it may be that the immunological memory induced by serotype 3 is different from that induced by the other serotypes. These results are consistent with what has been seen previously in other studies for serotype 3.

## Geometric Mean Fold Rises

The GMFRs in serum IgG concentrations from before the toddler dose to 1 month after the toddler dose are summarized in Table 9-9 for both studies. In study 3003, GMFRs ranged from 2.83 to 7.48, while in study 004, GMFRs ranged from 4.85 to 15.12. For all serotypes, the GMFRs were higher in study 004 than in study 3003, with GMFR ratios (study 3003/study 004) ranging from 0.38 to 0.79 (Table 9-9). The relatively low GMFRs in study 3003 reflect the high GMCs observed before the toddler dose in that study.

5.  Safety results

## Local Reactions

In comparing the data for local reactions, it should be noted that while 13vPnC was administered SC in study 3003, study vaccine was administered IM in study 004.

## Infant Series

The number and percentage of subjects with local reactions reported within 7 days after each dose in the infant series are presented in Table 10-3 through Table 10-5. For comparison, data for the 13vPnC group in study 004 are also shown.

In study 004, the incidence of tenderness after each dose was higher than in study 3003, both for any tenderness  (between  72%  and  79%)  and  for  significant  tenderness  (between  8%  and  14%).  In contrast,  the  incidence  of  induration  after  each  dose  was  higher  in  study  3003  (between  47%  and 54%) than in study 004 (between 27% and 38%), as was the incidence of erythema (between 67% and 75% in study 3003 and between 35% and 49% in study 004). In both studies, most reports of induration  and  erythema  were  mild.  Local  reactions  of  moderate  intensity  were  reported  more frequently  in  study  3003  than  in  study  004,  both  for  induration  (between  14%  and  30%  versus between 5% and 7%, respectively) and for erythema (between 24% and 44% versus between 1% and 6%, respectively). There were no reports of severe induration or erythema in study 004, while in study 3003, severe induration and severe erythema were each reported for 2 subjects after dose 2 (1.3%) and for 1 subject after dose 3 (0.7%). In study 004, there was a trend toward higher incidences of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tenderness, induration, and erythema with each subsequent dose, while in study 3003, no pattern of increasing or decreasing incidence across doses was apparent.

## Toddler Dose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The number and percentage of subjects with local reactions within 7 days after the toddler dose are presented in Table 10-6. In study 3003, the incidence of each type of reaction after the toddler dose was similar to the incidence that had been observed during the infant series, whereas in study 004, the incidences were somewhat higher after the toddler dose than during the infant series. Similar to what was seen during the infant series, the incidence of tenderness after the toddler dose was markedly higher  in  study  004  (81.2%)  than  in  study  3003  (18.2%),  while  the  incidences  of  induration  and erythema were higher in study 3003 (57.1% and 68.1%, respectively) than in study 004 (44.0% and 54.4%). There were no reports of significant tenderness after the toddler dose in study 3003, while 10 subjects  (15.4%)  experienced  significant  tenderness  in  study  004.  In  both  studies,  most  reports  of induration and erythema were mild. There were no reports of severe induration or erythema after the toddler dose in study 004, while in study 3003, severe induration was reported in 3 subjects (2.3%) and severe erythema was reported in 2 subjects (1.5%).

## Systemic Events

## Infant Series

The  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  systemic  events,  including  the  use  of  antipyretic medications, within 7 days after each dose in the infant series are presented in Table 10-7 through Table 10-9. In study 3003, fever was defined as an axillary temperature ≥37.5°C, while in study 004, fever  was  defined  as  a  core  (rectal)  temperature  ≥38.0°C.  In  the  following  tables,  the  incidence  of fever after each dose in the infant series is summarized for study 3003 only, using the protocol-defined criterion (any temperature ≥37.5°C). In addition, data from study 3003 are compared with those from study 004 using the criterion from study 004 for mild fever (≥38°C but ≤39°C). The protocols for both studies defined moderate fever as a temperature &gt;39°C but ≤40°C and severe fever as a temperature &gt;40°C.

- a. N = number of subjects reporting yes for at least 1 day or no for all days.
- b. n1 = Number of subjects reporting the event.
- C. Includes fever ≥38°C, decreased appetite, irritability, increased sleep, decreased sleep, and hives (urticaria).

Comparisons  of  data  between  the  studies  show  that  the  incidence  of  mild  fever  (defined  as  a temperature ≥38°C but ≤39°C) was substantially higher in study 004 (ranging from 24.0% to 43.2% across  doses)  than  in  study  3003  (ranging  from  6.7%  to  12.2%).  In  contrast,  the  incidences  of moderate fever (&gt;39°C but ≤40°C) were similar in the 2 studies, between 1.2% and 2.8% after each dose, except after dose 3 in study 004, where the incidence of moderate fever was 8.5% (8 subjects). Severe fever (&gt;40°C) was reported for only 1 subject, after dose 2 in study 3003.

The frequency of  antipyretic  medication  use  within  7  days  after  each  dose  in  the  infant  series  was much higher in study 004 than in study 3003. Antipyretic medications were used to treat symptoms in ≤6.5%  of  subjects  after  each  dose  in  study  3003,  compared  with  between  78.6%  and  82.4%  of subjects in study 004. Similarly, antipyretic medications were used to prevent symptoms in ≤3.3% of subjects after each dose in study 3003, compared with between 75.0% and 86.7% of subjects in study 004.

Other systemic events were consistently reported more frequently in study 004 than in study 3003:

-  Decreased  appetite  was  reported  for  ≤16.5%  of  subjects  in  study  3003  but  for  ≥54.8%  of subjects in study 004.
-  Irritability was reported for ≤36.1% of subjects in study 3003 but for ≥88.4% of subjects in study 004.
-  Increased sleep was reported for ≤40.6% of subjects in study 3003 but for ≥71.3% of subjects in study 004.
-  Decreased  sleep  was  reported  for  ≤23.1%  of  subjects  in  study  3003  but  for  ≥45.7%  of subjects in study 004.

The mean duration of systemic events after each dose of the infant series was between 1.8 and 3.1 days for all events except hives, for which the duration ranged from 1.0 day for 1 subject after dose 3 to 4.0 days for 1 subject after dose 2.

## Toddler Dose

The number and percentage of subjects reporting systemic events within 7 days after the toddler dose are  presented  in  Table  10-10.  In  study  3003,  the  incidence  of  fever  ≥37.5ºC  was  higher  after  the toddler  dose  (50.7%)  than  after  any  dose  in  the  infant  series  (maximum  of  40.3%),  as  was  the incidence of mild fever (≥38ºC but ≤39°C) (20.4%, compared with a maximum of 12.2% during the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

infant series). For all other types of systemic events in study 3003, there was no clear trend toward higher or lower incidence after the toddler dose as compared with the infant doses. Similar to what was observed during the infant series, the incidence of each type of systemic event after the toddler dose was consistently higher in study 004 than in study 3003.

## Spontaneously reported Adverse Events

During the infant series, spontaneously reported AEs were reported for approximately 92% of subjects in study 3003 and 83% of subjects in study 004. In general, the types of AEs reported in both studies were consistent with the types of childhood illnesses and conditions commonly occurring in this age group.  In  study  3003,  the  types  of  AEs  reported  most  frequently  during  the  infant  series  were infections (most often respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, exanthema subitum, and bronchitis); skin disorders (mostly diaper dermatitis and eczema); general disorders and administration site conditions (mostly injection site erythema and injection site induration); gastrointestinal  disorders  (mostly  diarrhea);  and  respiratory,  thoracic,  and  mediastinal  disorders (mostly rhinorrhea, asthma, and upper respiratory tract inflammation). Similar events were reported after the toddler dose. The types and frequencies of spontaneously reported AEs reported in study 004 were similar to those observed in study 3003.

In study 3003, a total of 30 SAEs were reported for 22 subjects (11.4%): 9 subjects (4.7%) during the infant series, 14 subjects (7.3%) after the infant series, and 1 subject (0.5%) after the toddler dose. Most were infections and infestations that required hospitalization. None of the SAEs were considered related to study vaccine by the investigator. There were no deaths during the study.

Three (3) subjects were withdrawn from study 3003 because of AEs: 2 because of febrile convulsions (considered not related to study vaccine) and 1 because of injection site swelling (considered related to study vaccine).

Assessor's comment: The local reactions induration and erythema were reported more frequently in study 3003 than in study 004, while tenderness had a higher incidence in study 004 than in 3003. The same  pattern  was  seen  after  the  infant  and  toddler  doses.  The  systemic  reactions  also  differed between the two studies.

## MAH overall conclusions for study 6096A1-3003-JA

In conclusion, 13vPnC administered SC as a 3-dose infant series followed by a booster dose at 12 to 15 months of age was immunogenic, safe, and well tolerated in Japanese infants. For all 13 serotypes, serum IgG concentrations were higher in Japanese infants (study 3003) than in infants in the United States (study 004), with GMRs (3003 relative to 004) for the 13 serotypes ranging from 1.72 to 5.88 after the infant series. The incidence of local reactions differed markedly between subjects vaccinated SC  in  study  3003  and  subjects  vaccinated  IM  in  study  004.  After  each  dose,  the  incidence  of tenderness  was  consistently  lower  in  study  3003  than  in  study  004,  while  the  incidences  of  both erythema and induration were consistently higher in study 3003 than in study 004. In addition, the incidence of mild fever (defined as a temperature ≥38°C but ≤39°C) was higher in study 004 than in study 3003. The adverse event profile of 13vPnC in Japanese infants was comparable to that observed in US infants.

Assessor's  comment:  The  conclusions  of  the  MAH  are  partly  endorsed  for  this  study.  The  adverse events profile are not considered comparable between the two studies, as there are several differences in incidences of local and systemic adverse events between the two studies. Whether they are due to the route of administration, other concomitant vaccines or other reasons is not clear.

The  reasons  for  the  higher  immune  responses  in  the  Japanese  study  were  discussed  in  the  clinical study  report.  There  are  several  possible  reasons  for  these  results,  e.g.  the  SC  route,the  age  at vaccination,the lack of concomitant vaccinations or among others. Considering the many differences between the studies it is difficult to conclude on the reason for the differing safety and immunogenicity results.

Study  6096A1-3008 :  A  Phase  3,  Randomized,  Active-Controlled,  Doubleblind  Trial  Evaluating  the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Infants Given With Routine Pediatric Vaccinations in Canada

-  Description
-  Methods
-  Objective(s)

The primary objectives of this study were as follows:

-  To demonstrate that the immune response induced by NeisVac-C given with 13vPnC is noninferior  to  the  immune response induced by NeisVac-C given with 7vPnC, when measured 1 month after the 2-dose NeisVac-C infant series. The immune response to the meningococcal C antigen in NeisVac-C was assessed using a serum bactericidal assay (SBA).

To demonstrate that the immune responses induced by Pentacel given with 13vPnC are non-inferior to the immune responses induced by Pentacel given with 7vPnC, when measured 1 month after the 3dose infant series. The immune responses to the following antigens in Pentacel were assessed: Hib and pertussis  antigens  (pertussis  toxoid  [PT],  filamentous  hemagglutinin  [FHA],  pertactin  [PRN],  and fimbrial agglutinogens [FIM]).  Immune responses to diphtheria, tetanus, and poliovirus antigens were not assessed in this study.

The 13vPnC immunogenicity objectives were as follows:

-  To assess the immune response to 13vPnC 1 month after a 3-dose infant series, as measured by serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels.
-  To assess the immune response to 13vPnC 1 month after the toddler dose, as measured by serum IgG levels.

The secondary objectives of this study were as follows:

-  To  assess  the  immune  response  induced  by  NeisVac-C  given  with  13vPnC  relative  to  the immune response induced by NeisVac-C given with 7vPnC, when measured 1 month after the toddler  dose.  Immune  response  to  the  meningococcal  C  antigen  in  NeisVac-C  was  assessed using an SBA.
-  To assess the immune response induced by Pentacel given with 13vPnC relative to the immune response induced by Pentacel given with 7vPnC at an alternative cutoff level, when measured 1 month after the infant series. Immune response to the Hib antigen in Pentacel was assessed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety objective of this study was as follows:

-  To evaluate the acceptability of the safety profile of the 13vPnC, as measured by the incidence rates of local reactions, systemic events, and adverse events (AEs).

##  Study design

This was a parallel-group, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of 13vPnC compared with 7vPnC in healthy infants.

##  Study population /Sample size

Approximately  570  subjects  (285  subjects  per  group)  were  to  be  enrolled  in  this  study  in  order  to achieve 241 evaluable subjects per group at approximately 12 sites. Subjects were to be randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio prospectively) to receive 13vPnC plus routine pediatric vaccines or 7vPnC plus routine pediatric vaccines.

##  Treatments

Each  subject  was  to  receive  1  dose  (0.5  mL)  of  either  13vPnC  or  7vPnC  together  with  at  least  1 concomitant  dose  of  a  routine  pediatric  vaccine  at  each  of  the  4  vaccination  visits.  Standard vaccination  practices  were  observed,  and  appropriate  resuscitative  equipment  was  available  in  the event  of  an  anaphylactic  reaction.  13vPnC  and  7vPnC  were  to  be  administered  by  intramuscular injection into the anterolateral thigh muscle of the left leg at 2, 4, and 6 months (infant series) and 12 months of age (toddler dose).

The following routine pediatric vaccines were given: Pentacel using a 2-, 4-, and 6-month infant series; NeisVac-C using a 2- and 6-month infant series followed by a toddler dose at 12 months of age; and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccines at 12 months of age.

##  Outcomes/endpoints

Blood samples were to be obtained 1 month after the third 7vPnC or 13vPnC dose of the infant series (visit  4,  at  approximately  7  months  of  age)  and  1  month  after  the  toddler  dose  (visit  6,  at approximately 13 months of age). Samples obtained after the infant series and toddler dose were to be tested for IgG antibodies against the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) present in 13vPnC in subjects receiving 13vPnC. Antibody responses to NeisVac-C and to selected antigens in Pentacel (Hib and pertussis antigens PT, FHA, PRN, and FIM) were to be measured  in  blood  samples  collected  from  all  subjects  1  month  after  the  infant  series.  Antibody responses to NeisVac-C were to be measured in blood samples collected from all subjects 1 month after the toddler dose.

Antibody responses to the NeisVac-C antigens were to be measured in blood samples collected from all subjects 1 month after the 2-dose NeisVac-C infant series (visit 4, at approximately 7 months of age). In addition, antibody responses to the pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN, and FIM) in Pentacel were to be  measured  in  blood  samples  collected  from  all  subjects  1  month  after  the  third  dose  (visit  4,  at approximately 7 months of age).

Parents/legal guardians were asked to monitor and record in an e-diary the subject's local reactions, systemic events, and use of antipyretic medication to treat and prevent symptoms for 4 days after each vaccination. Other signs and symptoms were to be recorded on the e-diary as well from visit 1 through  visit  4,  and  from  visit  5  to  visit  6;  the  e-diary  was  collected  at  visit  4,  returned  to  the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) at visit 5, and collected for the final time at visit 6.

AEs  were  to  be  collected  and  recorded  on  the  CRF  based  on  ancillary  information  on  the  e-diary, clinical evaluation during a study visit, and verbal questioning of the parent about the child's health since the last visit. AEs were to be collected from the signing of the informed consent to visit 4 and from visit 5 to visit 6. All SAEs were to be recorded from the signing of the informed consent to 6 months after  the  last  study  vaccination.  At  visit  5,  any  newly  diagnosed  chronic  medical  conditions since visit 4 were to be recorded.

A telephone contact was to be made 6 months after the last study vaccination to record any newly diagnosed  chronic  medical  conditions,  hospitalizations,  SAEs,  and  other  reportable  information  that occurred since the last study visit.

-  Statistical Methods

For the pneumococcal  IgG  concentrations, the proportion of subjects achieving an antibody concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL was computed for each blood sample obtained from subjects in the 13vPnC group.

Within  each  vaccine  group  and  for  each  concomitant  antigen  separately,  the  proportion  of  subjects achieving  at  least  a  prespecified  antibody  concentration  was  computed.  For  all  concomitant  vaccine antigens, non-inferiority was declared if the lower limit of the 2-sided, 95% CI for the difference in proportions was greater than -0.10.

##  Results

-  Recruitment/ Number analysed

The  number  of  subjects  planned  for  this  study  was  570,  with  285  in  each  vaccine  group.  Actual enrollment in the study was 603 subjects, who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio prospectively to either the 13vPnC group (n=300) or the 7vPnC group (n=303). In addition, 5 subjects were screened but not randomly assigned; consent had been obtained from the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) of 4 of these 5 subjects.

All 603 randomly assigned subjects (100%) received dose 1, 593 subjects (98.3%) received dose 2, and 587 subjects (97.3%) received dose 3. Overall, 96.8% (96.0% to 97.7% by group) completed the infant series. A total of 584 subjects (96.8%) completed the infant series, with a similar percentage of subjects in each group completing the series: 293 (97.7%) in the 13vPnC group and 291 (96.0%) in the 7vPnC group.

## Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics

The 2 vaccine groups were well balanced with respect to sex, race, ethnicity, age at enrollment, and weight at enrollment. The proportion of male subjects was slightly higher in the 13vPnC group (52.3%) than in the 7vPnC group (49.8%). Most subjects were white (81.7%) and non-Hispanic and non-Latino (95.9%). The mean age (±standard deviation [SD]) at enrollment was 2.1 (±0.3) months and the mean weight at enrollment was 5.4 (±0.8) kg.

##  Immunogenicity results

## Immune Response to Pneumococcal Antigens

## Proportion of Subjects Achieving Prespecified Antibody Levels

For the evaluable pneumococcal infant immunogenicity population, the proportions of responders after dose 3 of the infant series were all greater than 90.0% for each serotype common to both 13vPnC and 7vPnC (Table 9-5). The proportion of responders was greater than 95.0% for each of the 6 additional serotypes unique to 13vPnC, except serotype 3 (79.6%) and serotype 5 (87.0%).

## Pneumococcal IgG Geometric Mean Concentrations

GMCs of each serotype were measured 1 month after the infant series, and were calculated for each serotype of the 13vPnC vaccine group. In the evaluable infant immunogenicity population, IgG GMCs were  1.00  μg/mL  or  greater  for  all  pneumococcal  serotypes  except  serotype  3  (0.63  μg/mL)  and serotype 5 (0.90 μg/mL) (Table 9-6).

## Concomitant Vaccine Immunogenicity

The immune response induced by NeisVac-C given with 13vPnC was shown to be non-inferior to the immune response induced by NeisVac-C given with 7vPnC following the infant series and toddler dose. After the infant series, the proportion of responders was 96.8% for the 13vPnC group and 99.3% for the 7vPnC group. This non-inferiority conclusion was supported by the geometric mean titers (GMTs) for meningococcal C serum bactericidal assay (SBA) antibodies, which were approximately 361 for the 13vPnC group and 303 for the 7vPnC group. The ratio of GMTs (13vPnC to 7vPnC) was 1.19, and the lower  limit  of  the  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  of  the  ratio  was  0.96,  meeting  the  non-inferiority criterion. After the toddler dose, the proportion of responders was 100.0% for both the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups. This non-inferiority conclusion was supported by the GMTs for meningococcal C SBA antibodies, which were approximately 1380 for the 13vPnC group and 1084 for the 7vPnC group. The ratio of GMTs (13vPnC to 7vPnC) was 1.27, and the lower limit of the 95% CI of the ratio was 1.08, meeting the non-inferiority criterion.

The immune responses induced by Pentacel given with 13vPnC were shown to be non-inferior to the immune  responses  induced  by  Pentacel  given  with  7vPnC  after  the  infant  series.  The  immune responses were very similar in the 2 vaccine groups for the specific antigens assessed (pertussis and Hib).  All  comparisons  of  the  proportions  of  subjects  achieving  prespecified  antibody  levels  for concomitant vaccine antigens met the non-inferiority criterion for the 4 pertussis antigens (pertussis toxoid [PT], filamentous hemagglutinin [FHA], pertactin [PRN], and fimbrial agglutinogens [FIM]) and Hib.  When  Hib  was  assessed  at  the  higher  antibody  level  (≥1.0  μg/mL),  the  responses  were  also shown to be non-inferior. Similarly, when the pertussis antigen responses were assessed at the higher antibody  concentration  for  FHA  and  the  concentrations  achieved  by  95%  of  the  7vPnC  group,  noninferiority criteria were also met.

GMTs and GMCs in the 2 groups were comparable for all antigens and were formally non-inferior using the 2-fold criterion for each of these antigens. The results for the infant series are summarised in Table 9-3, the results of the toddler dose are not presented in this AR.

##  Safety results

## Prompted Adverse Events

## Local Reactions

The majority of local reactions were mild in severity after any dose. The incidence and severity of local reactions at the pneumococcal vaccine injection site were similar for the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups. With the exception of significant tenderness (p=0.034) after dose 3 (3.8% and 0.8%  in the 13vPnC and  7vPnC  groups,  respectively),  there  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  2 vaccine  groups  in  the  incidence  of  local  reactions  within  4  days  of  vaccination  after  any  dose. Significant tenderness was reported by fewer than 4.5% of subjects in either vaccine group following any  dose  in  the  infant  series  and  by  2.5%  or  fewer  subjects  in  either  vaccine  group  following  the toddler dose. No subjects reported severe induration or severe erythema at the injection site after any dose.

## Systemic Events

The incidence of each type of systemic event was generally similar for the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups after  each  dose.  There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  vaccine  groups  in  the incidence of any type of prompted systemic event following any dose, except for irritability, which had a higher incidence in the 13vPnC group (68.8%) than in the 7vPnC group (58.5%; p=0.023) after the toddler dose.

Most occurrences of fever were mild and did not exceed 13.3% in the 13vPnC group and 12.2% in the 7vPnC  group  following  any  dose.  The  incidence  of  moderate  fever  did  not  exceed  2.0%  and  1.4% among 13vPnC and 7vPnC recipients, respectively, after any dose. Severe fever (&gt;40°C) was reported in 1 subject (0.5%) in the 7vPnC group.

## Spontaneously Reported Adverse Events

During the infant series, spontaneously reported AEs were reported for 76.3% of 13vPnC recipients and 75.9% of 7vPnC recipients. Most of the AEs were the types of conditions and symptoms expected in infants in this age group. The types of AEs reported most frequently during the infant series were infections (most often nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and bronchiolitis); gastrointestinal  disorders  (mostly  diarrhea,  vomiting,  teething,  and  constipation);  general  disorders and administration site conditions (mostly pyrexia, irritability, and injection site erythema); respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (mostly nasal congestion, cough, and rhinorrhea); and skin disorders (mostly eczema, rash, and diaper dermatitis). Similar events were reported after the toddler dose.

AEs that  were  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  related  to  study  vaccine  were  general  disorders  and administration  site  conditions  (injection  site  erythema  and  irritability),  gastrointestinal  disorders

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(diarrhea and vomiting), and infections and infestations (nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection).

A total of 35 SAEs were reported for 25 subjects who received 13vPnC and 20 SAEs for 17 subjects who received 7vPnC. During the infant series, SAEs occurred in 5 subjects (8 events) vaccinated with 13vPnC  and  in  5  subjects  (7  events)  vaccinated  with  7vPnC.  After  the  infant  series,  11  subjects reported 17 SAEs and 7 subjects reported 7 SAEs in the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups, respectively. Two (2) SAEs in 2 subjects were reported in each of the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups during the toddler dose. During the 6-month follow-up period, SAEs were reported for 7 subjects (8 SAEs) in the 13vPnC group and  3  subjects  (4  SAEs)  in  the  7vPnC  group.  Most  were  infections  and  infestations  that  required hospitalization and were not considered related to study vaccine. One (1) subject reported a related SAE of severe pyrexia after receiving the 13vPnC toddler dose. There were no deaths during the study.

Five (5) subjects in the 7vPnC group withdrew from the study after dose 3 because of AEs (urticaria, febrile neutropenia, convulsion, febrile convulsion, and movement disorder).

## Conclusions of the MAH:

13vPnC may be given safely in a 3-dose infant series, administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age with concomitant  NeisVac-C  and  Pentacel.  The  immunogenicity  of  the  meningococcal  group  C,  Hib,  and pertussis components of these vaccines was not adversely affected by concomitant administration of 13vPnC. The 13vPnC was immunogenic with substantial responses seen to all 13 serotypes after the infant series. The safety analysis of infant series data showed that most local reactions and systemic events were mild, and no clinically important differences between vaccine groups were noted for the prompted symptoms or unsolicited AEs. Although not formally tested, no increase in local or systemic AEs  was  seen  in  this  study  from  dose  1  to  dose  2  to  dose  3.  For  most  events,  the  proportion  of reported AEs actually tended to decrease with subsequent doses. These results indicate that the safety profile of 13vPnC is similar to that of 7vPnC, the standard of care for infants and young children.

13vPnC  administered  with  concomitant  vaccines  in  this  study  in  Canadian  children  demonstrated  a comparable safety profile to 7vPnC and good immunogenicity for all pneumococcal and concomitant vaccine antigens studied.

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

## MAH overall conclusions:

Subcutaneous  administration  of  13vPnC  in  study  3003  elicited  strong  IgG  responses  to  all  13 pneumococcal conjugate serotypes after the infant series and toddler dose. When compared with study 004, the antibody responses were generally higher in study 3003. The higher immune responses in study  3003  may  be  due  to  ethnic  differences  in  response  to  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccination. Studies with Prevenar given subcutaneously in Japan and intramuscularly in other Asian populations have also shown a high immune response. Pneumococcal immunogenicity results from study 3008 with IM administration of 13vPnC also indicate a strong IgG response to all 13 serotypes following the infant series and toddler dose in the 13vPnC group.

Concomitant  vaccine  immunogenicity  data  from  study  3008  show  that  the  responses  elicited  by NeisVac-C given with 13vPnC are non-inferior to those elicited by NeisVac-C given with 7vPnC using a 2- and 6-month infant series followed by a toddler dose at 12 months of age. The immune responses to  pertussis  and  Hib  antigens  induced  by  Pentacel  given  with  13vPnC  were  also  shown  to  be  noninferior to the immune responses induced by Pentacel given with 7vPnC after the 2-, 4-, and 6-month infant series.

Overall, safety and tolerability in study 3003 was acceptable. The incidence of local reactions differed markedly between subjects vaccinated SC in study 3003 and subjects vaccinated IM in study 004. The difference  in  local  reactions  is  likely  due  to  the  different  route  of  administration.  The  incidence  of systemic events was either similar to or lower in study 3003 compared with study 004.

Safety data from study 3008 demonstrate similar rates of local reactions and systemic events among 13vPnC and 7vPnC recipients. The rates and nature of SAEs and other AEs associated with 13vPnC were similar to those associated with 7vPnC. The safety profile of 13vPnC was shown to be comparable with that of 7vPnC and the frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has not changed compared with the frequency reported in the MAA.

The data presented in this Article 46 submission package do not alter the benefit-risk assessment of 13vPnC; therefore, no further regulatory action is required at this time with respect to the marketing authorization for Prevenar 13.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Assessor's  comment:  The  conclusions  of  the  MAH  are  generally  endorsed,  except  that  the  safety results of the Japanese study and the US study are not considered comparable. The Japanese study provides data on SC administration of Prevenar 13, which has not been used previously in other clinical studies. This information can be useful for prescribers when vaccinating children with thrombocytopaenia  or  any  coagulation  disorder  that  would  contraindicate  intramuscular  injection. Therefore, we do not agree that no further regulatory action is required, and the MAH should submit a variation to include a statement on subcutaneous administration.

## III. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

Immunogenicity: The conclusions of the MAH are generally endorsed. The Immunogenicity results from the two submitted studies are in agreement with previously submitted studies.

Safety: The conclusions of the MAH are generally endorsed. The safety results from the two submitted studies are in agreement with previously submitted studies.

However, we do not agree with the MAH that no further regulatory action is needed. The Japanese study provides data on SC administration of Prevenar 13, which has not been used previously in other clinical  studies.  This  information  can  be  useful  for  prescribers  when  vaccinating  children  with thrombocytopaenia  or  any  coagulation  disorder  that  would  contraindicate  intramuscular  injection. Therfore the MAH should submit a variation to include a statement on subcutaneous administration.

## Update 2010-05-11

One  comment  from  a  MS  was  received  not  supporting  the  demand  for  a  type  II  variation.  The Rapporteur does not agree with the MS comment. Since information is available from SC vaccination of children this could be valuable for the prescriber. However, the Rapporteur does agree that it is not possible to state that the immune responses are in any way superior to IM vaccination, considering that  the  data  are  not  entirely  comparable  due  to  the  many  differences  between  the  studies.  The Rapporteur  suggests  a statement  in  the  SPC  that  the  vaccine  has  been  given  SC  without  safety  or immunogenicity concerns.
