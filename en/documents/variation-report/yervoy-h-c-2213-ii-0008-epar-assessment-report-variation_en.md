| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II     |

The MAH proposed the extension of indication of Yervoy for the treatment of previously untreated adult patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma. Consequently, changes were proposed to sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). The package leaflet was proposed to be updated accordingly.  Editorial changes were also made to the SmPC and package leaflet.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0116/2012 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and on the granting of a class waiver.

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0116/2012 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0116/2012.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Ipilimumab (MDX-010, BMS-734016), a fully human anti-human CTLA-4 (CD152) monoclonal antibody of the IgG1-κ isotype, is an immunomodulatory agent that is being developed for use in the treatment of cancer. The proposed mechanism of action for ipilimumab is interference of the interaction of CTLA4, expressed on a subset of activated T cells, with B7 (CD80/CD86) molecules on professional antigenpresenting cells. This results in T-cell potentiation due to blockade of the inhibitory modulation of T-cell activation promoted by the CTLA-4/B7 interaction.

The resulting T-cell activation, proliferation, and lymphocyte infiltration into tumours, leads to tumour cell death. The mechanism of action of ipilimumab is indirect, through enhancing T-cell mediated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

immune response. The commercial dosage form proposed for the European Union (EU) is a 5 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion.

Ipilimumab was granted a marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) on 13 July 2011 and is currently approved for the indication 'treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults who have received prior therapy '.

Ipilimumab is administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg for a maximum of 4 doses.

The marketing authorisation was based on the results of the pivotal study MDX010-20 ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) where ipilimumab has shown a statistically significant improvement in OS compared to gp100 vaccine (experimental vaccine), when given as second line therapy of patients with metastatic melanoma with HLA-A0201 positive status. Median OS was 10.1 months with ipilimumab alone versus 6.4 months with gp100 vaccine (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51, 0.87, p=0.003). A significant increase in PFS was also observed (HR 0.64, median PFS 2.86 months with Ipilimumab and 2.76 months with gp100 vaccine, p&lt;0.001). BORR (PR+CR) and disease control rate was 10.9% and 28.5%, respectively. Longterm survival data indicates that 54 of the 403 patients in the ipilimumab plus gp100 group, 24 of the 137 patients in the ipilimumab monotherapy group, and 16 of the 136 patients in the gp100 monotherapy group, remain alive for a minimum of 2 years. The positive efficacy results for ipilimumab of the MDX010-20 study were supported by high level results from study CA184024 in which an OS benefit was seen for previously untreated patients treated with ipilimumab (10 mg/kg) in combination with dacarbazine (DTIC) compared to patients treated with DTIC alone.

In this application, the MAH applied to extension the indication of Yervoy to previously untreated adult patients advanced melanoma (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma at a proposed posology of 3 mg/kg.

Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer. The incidence of melanoma varies between different European countries the estimated incidence is about 3.5 /100.000 men and 2.5/ 100.000 women per year. White populations have an approximately 10-fold greater risk of developing cutaneous melanoma than black, Asian or Hispanic populations (Goldstein AM, et al., Curr Opin Oncol. 1993; 5:258-363). Approximately half the incidence is in people between the age of 35 and 65 years, with a median age at diagnosis of 57 years. The last decades the incidence has been increased continuously.  The increase in incidence affect all ages.

The prognosis of localized disease (thin lesions &lt;1.0 mm without adverse prognostic features) is excellent, with greater than 90% survival when detected early and treated with adequate surgery. However, about 20% of the patients diagnosed with melanoma develop metastases. For these patients the prognosis is poor: the 5-year survival rate is lower than 15%; only 25.5.% of patients are alive at 1 year.  Palliative treatment, consisting of systemic therapy, surgery and/or radiotherapy, is the only therapeutic option for patients with unresectable or metastatic disease. Complete resection of isolated metastases to one anatomic site (lung, gastrointestinal tract, bone or brain) may occasionally achieve long term survival. Systemic treatment may consist of chemotherapy, and/or immunotherapy. Palliative radiotherapy is indicated for symptomatic relief of metastases to brain, bones and viscera.

Currently, only DTIC and vemurafenib are approved for systemic first line treatment of advanced melanoma. However, both options have their limitations and restrictions.

DTIC may achieve objective response rates of about 20%, of which less than 5% is complete remission (Huncharek M. et al., Melanoma Res 2001; 11:75-81).  Responses are usually short, although, for a very limited number of patients long term survival has been reported.

Vemurafenib is a low molecular weight, orally available, inhibitor of the activated form of the BRAF serine-threonine kinase enzyme. It is indicated for patients for the treatment of BRAF V600 mutation-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Consequently, for more than 50% of the patients with advanced melanoma vemurafenib is no treatment option.

It is considered that still an unmet medical need exist for first line treatment of advanced melanoma.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

According to the CHMP guideline 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' (ref. EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, dated 01 June 2006), 'Vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Similarly, vaccines and herbal medicinal products are also exempted due to the nature of their constituents'.

Ipilimumab is a natural substance (protein composed of natural amino acids), the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, ipilimumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

All studies with pharmacokinetic data for ipilimumab are summarized in Table 2. PK results from studies Medarex (MDX)-sponsored studies and Bristol-Myers Squibb (CA-studies)-sponsored studies CA184004, CA184007, CA184008, and CA184022 have been discussed in the reports of the initial marketing authosiation application (MAA) for Yervoy. This application included newly submitted PK data from phase 3 study CA184024 and from the drug-drug interaction study CA184078.

The objective of the applicant was to provide clinical pharmacology data of ipilimumab to support of the treatment of advanced melanoma in previously untreated patients with this 3 mg/kg monotherapy, to overcome the lack of data at that dose from the provided phase 3 study which used a 10 mg/kg dose in combination with dacarbazine. Consequently, the applicant provided a population pharmacokinetics (popPK) analysis based on all CA-studies.

## Study CA184078: interaction between ipilimumab and paclitaxel/carboplatin or between ipilimumab and dacarbazine

Study CA184078 was a 3-arm, parallel, randomized, open-label phase 1 study of ipilimumab administered alone or in combination with chemotherapy in subjects with untreated advanced melanoma.

Subjects were randomized (1:1:1) to one of the following 3 treatment arms: to receive ipilimumab alone or in combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin, or in combination with dacarbazine  during the Induction Phase:

· Arm A: During the Induction Phase, each subject received paclitaxel/carboplatin (paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] by a 3-hour infusion and carboplatin [AUC=6] IV by a 30-minute infusion) on Day 1 (Week 1 Day 1) and ipilimumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV administered on Day 3 (Week 1 Day 3). Further doses of ipilimumab (Weeks 4, 7, and 10) and paclitaxel/carboplatin (Weeks 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, and 22) were administered every 3 weeks, with subjects receiving the ipilimumab infusion first, followed by the paclitaxel and then carboplatin infusions. A maximum of 8 doses of chemotherapy was permitted.

· Arm B: During the Induction Phase, each subject received dacarbazine (dacarbazine 850 mg/m2 IV by a 1-hour infusion) on Day 1 (Week 1 Day 1) and ipilimumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV administered over 90 minutes on Day 3 (Week 1 Day 3). Further doses of ipilimumab (Weeks 4, 7, and 10) and dacarbazine (Weeks 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, and 22) were provided every 3 weeks, with subjects receiving the ipilimumab infusion first, followed by the dacarbazine infusion. A maximum of 8 doses of chemotherapy was permitted.

· Arm C: During the Induction Phase, each subject received ipilimumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV administered over 90 minutes every 3 weeks for up to 4 doses (Weeks 1 [Week 1 Day 1], 4, 7, and 10).

In Arm A, PK samples to measure paclitaxel in plasma were collected up to 48 hours after the first dose of paclitaxel on Day 1 (without ipilimumab) and after the third dose at Week 7 (with ipilimumab).

In Arm B, PK samples to measure dacarbazine and its active metabolite, 5- minoimidazole-4carboxamide (AIC), in plasma were collected up to 24 hours after the first dose of dacarbazine (before ipilimumab) and after the third dose at Week 7 (with ipilimumab).

In all 3 arms, PK samples to assess the PK profile of ipilimumab at steady-state were collected after the third dose of ipilimumab (Week 7).

## Ipilimumab pharmacokinetics

The PK parameters of ipilimumab are summarized in Table 3. Co-administration of chemotherapy concurrent with ipilimumab resulted in slight deceases in exposure, however the mean estimates of area under the curve (AUC), maximum observed concentration (Cmax), and half-life (T-HALF) values were comparable across the treatment arms. The mean systemic clearance (CL) and Vss values were similar between the 3 treatment arms.

The geometric means for ipilimumab Cmax and AUC(0-21d) changed 0.982 and 0.917 fold, respectively, in the presence of dacarbazine. The 90% CIs for the geometric mean ratios were contained within 0.75 and 1.21.

The geometric means for ipilimumab Cmax and AUC(0-21d) changed 0.934 and 0.868 fold, respectively, in the presence of paclitaxel/carboplatin. The 90% CIs for the geometric mean ratios were contained within 0.68 and 1.14.

## Pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel with or without ipilimumab

Pharmacokinetic parameters of paclitaxel with (day 43) or without (day 1) 10 mg/kg ipilimumab are summarized in Table 4. The geometric means for paclitaxel Cmax and AUC(INF) changed 0.963 and 1.068 fold, respectively, in the presence of ipilimumab. All 90% CIs for the geometric mean ratios were contained within 0.79 and 1.20.

## Pharmacokinetics of dacarbazine with or without ipilimumab

Ipilimumab did not affect the pharmacokinetics of dacarbazine and its active metabolite AIC. The PK parameters are summarized in Table 5. The geometric means for dacarbazine Cmax and AUC(INF) changed 1.027 and 0.912 fold, respectively, in the presence of ipilimumab. Those for its metabolite,

## Population pharmacokinetics

The popPK analysis is an extension of the popPK analysis evaluated in the original application for Yervoy supplemented with sparse PK data from the phase 3 study CA184024 and rich PK data from the pharmacokinetic interaction study CA184078. 3200 ipilimumab serum concentration values from 785 subjects with advanced melanoma who received 0.3 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg ipilimumab during the induction dosing period from several clinical studies: one chemo-combination phase 1 study (CA184078, N=29), four phase 2 monotherapy clinical studies (CA184004 N=79,CA184007 N=112, CA184008 N=148 and CA184022 N=177) and one randomized phase 3 study in combination with dacarbazine (CA184024, N=240). Of these, 528 subjects received ipilimumab alone, while 257 subjects received ipilimumab with dacarbazine. This analysis included 348 previously untreated and 437 previously treated advanced melanoma subjects.

In most studies, PK samples were collected on Day 1 and Day 43 (3rd dose), preinfusion and after 90minute infusion. Three additional samples were taken between Day 3-7 (post-dose) after week 7 dose, Day 10-15 (post-dose) after week 7 dose and the predose sample on Day 64. In study CA184078 PK

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

drug interaction study, samples were collected on Day 1 and Day 43, preinfusion and 1.5, 3, 5, 9, 24, and 48 hours post-start of infusion.

Ipilimumab PK was described with a linear two-compartment model with zero-order IV infusion parameterized in terms of clearance (CL), volume of central compartment (VC), inter-compartmental clearance (Q), and volume of peripheral compartment (VP).

PopPK parameters were very similar to the popPK model in the initial application. Like previous, bodyweight was a significant co-variate for both CL and VC and ipilimumab CL increased with higher LDH baseline levels. In the original application, it was discussed that no dose adjustments based on baseline LDH and bodyweight are necessary as ipilimumab is being dosed per bodyweight.

Concomitant dacarbazine, prior systemic anti-cancer therapy, and immunogenicity status were not retained in the final model because they were found not to clinically relevant predictors of ipilimumab PK.

Ipilimumab concentration-time data were described with a linear, two-compartment, zero-order IVinfusion model with first-order elimination. Dose proportionality in the PK of ipilimumab was investigated in a previous report and ipilimumab was found to exhibit dose proportional PK. This was again confirmed by the current popPK model: Cl, Vss and elimination half-life were independent of dose (Table 6). The estimated mean (CV%) of CL, VSS, and,T1/2β are 0.0168 L/h (38.1%), 7.47 L (10.1%), and 15.4 days (34.4%). The individual PK parameter estimates for the 3 and 10 mg/kg dose are obtained from final popPK model have been summarized in Table 6.

Table 6 - PK parameter estimates obtained from the final pop-PK model for ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg in advanced melanoma subjects (CA184004, CA184007, CA184008, CA184022, CA184024, and CA184078)

## Renal impairment

In the popPK model 350 subjects with normal renal function (GFR&gt;80 ml/min), 349 with mild renal impairment (GFR 50-80 ml/min), 82 subjects with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-50 ml/min) and 4 subjects with severe renal impairment (GFR&lt;30 ml/min) were included. Like in the popPK model in the original application, the CL of ipilimumab is similar across the renal function groups. Median CL of ipilimumab for subjects with normal renal function, mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment is 0.017, 0.015, 0.015, and 0.014 L/hr, respectively. The results confirm that ipilimumab can be dosed without regard to renal function.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

The bulk of the PK data came from subjects with normal hepatic function (708 subjects including a subject whose classification was missing and was reclassified as normal) and those with mild hepatic impairment (76 subjects). Mild hepatic impairment was defined as bilirubin between 1 and 1.5x ULN or AST&gt;ULN. The median values of CL for the normal and mild hepatic function categories are 0.015, and 0.018 L/hr, respectively. Thus, mild hepatic impairment has no effect on ipilimumab CL.

## Previously treated and untreated advanced melanoma

This analysis included 348 previously untreated and 437 previously treated advanced melanoma subjects. The final popPK model was used to generate exposure metrics (Cminss) using data from 0.3, 3 and 10 mg/kg ipilimumab dosing. Ipilimumab Cminss was comparable in previously treated or untreated melanoma subjects (data not shown).

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

Data on T-cell activation from the newly and previously submitted studies was also discussed in this application.

The MAH also submitted exposure-OS analysis from the phase 3 study CA184024 for ipilimumab 10 mg/kg with dacarbazine (DTIC) compared with DTIC alone in untreated patients and exposuresafety analysis from all CA studies will be discussed in the pharmacology section of the report.

## Biomarker analysis: Activation of T-cells

CTLA-4, the target of ipilimumab, is expressed only on T cells. Previously, activation of T-cells at the 3 mg/kg dose was studied in previously treated or untreated subjects in the Phase 2 CA184004 trial. Treatment with ipilimumab resulted in an increase in the frequency of activated CD4+ and CD8+ Tcells (defined as expression of HLA-DR). Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg induces a sustained increase from baseline in frequency of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells for both the untreated and previously treated subjects (Table 7).

Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg induced an increase in frequency of activated HLA-DR+ CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells when administered as monotherapy or in combination with DTIC or paclitaxel/carboplatin (data not shown).

Previously, ipilimumab monotherapy has been shown to result in an increase from baseline in mean absolute lymphocyte count (ALC). Also in the Phase 3 study (CA184024), mean ALC increased over time after initiation of treatment in the 10 mg/kg ipilimumab plus DTIC group, but not in the DTIC monotherapy group. The increase in ALC by ipilimumab was not affected by DTIC in study CA185078.

## Exposure-Efficacy Response Analysis: Overall Survival

CA184024 was a large, double-blind, multi-center Phase 3 study in previously untreated advanced melanoma subjects (see Clinical Efficacy for details on methodology).

Exposure-response (E-R) analyses were performed to characterize the relationship between ipilimumab steady-state trough concentration (Cminss) and select clinical endpoints.

The exposure-overall survival (OS) relationship was analysed with the Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model. Higher ipilimumab Cminss increased survival. The relative hazard ratio for a subject who had median Cminss value of 49.9 µg/mL was 0.73 relative to a subject in the placebo (placebo plus dacarbazine) group. Metastatic status, LDH, and ECOG status were determined to be potentially clinically relevant predictors of OS. The magnitude of covariate effects were assessed by the ratio of parameter estimates relative to typical parameter values for a reference subject. Subjects with the worst metastatic status (M1C) had 2.24-fold higher risk of death compared to subjects with milder metastatic status (M0). A poor ECOG status (ECOG =1) subject had higher risk (1.71-fold) than a normal ECOG status subject. Subjects with elevated LDH status (&gt; ULN) were at a higher risk (2.22 times) when compared with subjects who had normal LDH status.

The distribution of OS (time-to-death) relative to the first dose was characterized using the KaplanMeier (KM) analysis. KM analysis for OS grouped by ipilimumab exposure (using Cminss tertiles) is presented graphically in Figure 1. The Cminss tertiles were defined as the following:

- 1st Cminss tertile (0 &lt; Cminss ≤ 42.11 mcg/mL),
- 2nd Cminss tertile (42.11 &lt; Cminss ≤ 59.94 mcg/mL), and
- 3rd Cminss tertile (Cminss &gt; 59.94 mcg/mL).

The ipilimumab Cminss values for dacarbazine + placebo group were assumed to be zero. Based on the result from KM analysis using ipilimumab exposure (Figure 1) the ris k of death tended to decrease with increasing Cminss.

## Exposure-Safety Response Analyses: immune related Adverse Event

Data from all CA studies were included to evaluate ipilimumab exposure -  immune related Adverse Event (irAE) relationship. The relationship between Cminss and the probability of having Grade 2+ and Grade 3+ irAEs was characterized with data from 1036 subjects in one Phase 1 study (CA184078),four Phase 2 studies (CA184004, CA184007, CA184008, and CA184022) and one Phase 3 study (CA184024). Of these, 528 subjects received ipilimumab alone, while 257 subjects received ipilimumab with DTIC and 251 subjects administered DTIC + placebo. Immune-related AEs were selected as the safety endpoint for the E-R analysis because they are likely causally related to drug exposure and the mechanism of action of ipilimumab, and were the most frequently reported drug-related AEs. An Emax-based proportional odds model was developed to describe the probability of experiencing a worst irAE of grade 2 or greater (Grade ≥ 2), and grade 3 or greater (Grade ≥ 3). A separate model was developed for each of gastrointestinal irAEs, hepatobiliary irAEs, skin irAEs, and any occurrence of gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, skin, endocrine, neurologic, or 'other' irAEs (in any organ).

The E-R analyses indicated that the probability of experiencing irAE Grade ≥ 2 and Grade ≥ 3 increased with increasing Cminss (Table 8). In addition to Cminss, the following covariates were also assessed as potential predictors of irAE: age, weight, baseline LDH, baseline ALC, concomitant DTIC, gender, previous treatment status, ECOG status, and metastatic stage, and the presence of liver metastases (in the hepatobiliary irAE model).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Concomitant DTIC was retained as a covariate in the Final GI and hepatobiliary irAE models. Coadministration of DTIC with ipilimumab was associated with a markedly increased risk of having hepatobiliary irAEs (OR: 9.3) but a decreased risk of GI irAEs (OR: 0.57). No other covariates were found to have explanatory value. Liver metastases was evaluated as a potential explanatory factor for hepatobiliary irAEs, however, it was not associated with high incidence of Grade 3+ irAEs.20 No covariate was retained in the Final E-R model for skin irAEs.

The only factor retained in the Final E-R model for any irAE (other than Cminss) was previous treatment status. However, the effect of DTIC and previous treatment status might be confounded as most previously untreated subjects received DTIC, and therefore the selection of this factor may be an artifact of the potential confounding between these two estimated effects. Specifically, the apparent increase in the risk of irAEs in previously untreated patients may in fact be due to the increased risk of the hepatobiliary component of any irAEs, which has been shown to be markedly higher (OR: 9.3) for patients who received concomitant DTIC.

## 2.3.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg demonstrated a prolonged and significant OS benefit in the randomized Phase 3 study MDX010-20 in previously treated melanoma patients.

In study CA184024 ipilimumab was given at a 10 mg/kg dose+DTIC. PK and exposure-response analysis from phase 3 study CA184024 have been submitted to support the rationale for the extension of the indication to be approved for ipilimumab as monotherapy at a 3 mg/kg dose.

PK of ipilimumab was similar in previously treated and untreated, advanced melanoma. Two ipilimumab target concentrations were set: Cminss 3 µg/ml to block CD86 and 20 µg/ml to block CD86 and CD80. Ninety nine percent of the subjects in the 3 mg/kg dose exceeded the 3 µ/mL ipilimumab target trough concentration, however, less than 50% of the subjects exceeded the 20 µg/ml ipilimumab target trough concentration. Ipilimumab increased the percentage of activated HLA-DR+ CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in both previously treated and previously untreated subjects.

With respect to exposure-response analyses of the phase 3 study CA184024 at a 10 mg/kg dose+DTIC, metastatic status, LDH, and ECOG status were clinically relevant predictors of OS. Subjects with the worst metastatic status (M1C), poor ECOG status (ECOG =1) and subjects with elevated LDH status (&gt; ULN) had a higher risk of death. The Cox proportional hazard model indicated that higher ipilimumab Cminss increased probability of survival. The relative hazard ratio for a subject who had median Cminss value of 49.9 µg/mL was 0.73 relative to a subject in the placebo arm (placebo plus DTIC). Also Kaplan Meier estimates indicated a better OS with higher ipilimumab Cminss. However, only subjects with ipilimumab Cminss concentrations &gt;42 µg/ml appeared to have a higher OS over dacarbazine alone. Based on PK data submitted in the original application (median Cminss ipilimumab for 3 mg/kg was 17.9 µg/ml and 95% percentile was 38.9 µg/ml), it is clear that such high ipilimumab Cminss concentrations are not be reached with a 3 mg/kg ipilimumab dose. The exposure efficacy response analysis suggested a lower efficacy (lower OS) for the 3 mg/kg as compared to the 10 mg/kg ipilimumab treatment. However, the results are difficult to interpret, because the difference can also be explained by an imbalance in prognostic factors in the patient groups with a relatively low plasma concentration. Also, the comparison may be biased as the groups being compared are based on post-baseline criteria and patients with poorer prognosis are likely to have lower exposure.

The results from the Cox proportional hazard analysis to investigate the exposure - OS relationship could also not exclude that the effect of ipilimumab may be reduced in patients receiving concomitant DTIC. A possible negative interaction for concomitant use of ipilimumab and DTIC is of less concern at this time, because the MAH applies for an indication for ipilimumab monotherapy.

The probability of Grade 2+ (Gr2+) and Grade 3+ (Gr3+) any irAEs was indeed lower at 3 mg/kg monotherapy compared to 10 mg/kg. However, the probability of Gr2+ and Gr3+ any irAE appeared to be higher in previously untreated compared to previously treated patients. This effect of previous treatment status might be confounded as most previously untreated subjects received ipilimumab in combination with DTIC.

This application also included results from a drug-interaction study of ipilimumab administered alone and in combination with chemotherapy (dacarbazine or paclitaxel/carboplatin) evaluating interaction with CYP isozymes (particularly CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4) in patients with treatmentnaive advanced melanoma. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug drug interaction and this is reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC.

Additional information has also been included in the SmPC with regards to patients with renal and hepatic impairment further to the additional population PK data submitted in this application.

## 2.3.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The clinical pharmacology data submitted in this application were considered adequate to support the proposed indication. Further discussion on the posology recommendation is addressed in the efficacy and safety sections.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Dose response study

No dose-response study was submitted.

The primary evidence of efficacy and safety of 10 mg/kg ipilimumab in untreated advanced melanoma is based on study CA184024.

Four of the clinical studies (MDX010-20, MDX010-08, CA184022 and CA 184004) evaluated the recommended dose of 3 mg/kg administered once every 3 weeks (q3w) for 4 doses, were submitted and assessed during the initial MA. To support the same posology recommendation for the currently applied indication (treatment of previously untreated melanoma patients), data were analyzed by prior treatment (previously treated vs previously untreated, chemotherapy naïve vs chemotherapy pretreated) and is further discussed in the following section.

## Treatments

Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive DTIC plus ipilimumab or DTIC plus placebo.

## Ipilimumab

Each patients received ipilimumab (10 mg/kg or placebo) as a single dose via a 90-minute intravenous (IV) infusion. In the induction phase, ipilimumab or placebo was administered at Weeks 1, 4, 7 and 10 for a total of 4 separate doses. Patients without progressive disease who continued to tolerate placebo

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

or active ipilimumab continued dosing in 12-week intervals (maintenance phase). Ipilimumab administration continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.

## Dacarbazine (DTIC)

All patients in the induction phase received open-label DTIC at 850 mg/m2 IV over 30 to 60 minutes every 3 weeks up to Week 22, until PD on or after Week 12, unacceptable toxicity associated with DTIC or ipilimumab/placebo, discontinuation of ipilimumab, or withdrawal from treatment or the study itself. Whenever applicable (Weeks 1, 4, 7 and 10), DTIC was to be administered following ipilimumab/placebo, on the same day.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this study was to compare overall survival (OS) in patients with previously untreated stage IIIc, N3 (unresectable) or Stage IV melanoma receiving dacarbazine plus 10 mg/kg ipilimumab vs dacabazine with placebo.

Secondary objectives included the comparison between the two arms of progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (proportion with best overall response of complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] or stable disease [SD]), the estimate of survival rates at 1 year, 18 months and 2 years for each treatment arm; the estimates of the duration of response, time to response, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for each treatment arm. In addition, serum samples were to be obtained for population pharmacokinetics (PK).

Following database lock for the main analysis, the study was amended and will continue in an Extension Phase, the objectives of which are to estimate survival rates at 3, 4, and 5 years for ipilimumab and to evaluate the safety profile of ipilimumab for patients in the Extension Phase.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Overall Survival (OS) was defined for each patient as the time between randomization date and death. If a patient was still alive, the patient was censored at the last known alive date

Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time between randomization and the date of progression or death, which ever occurred first. A patient who died without reported prior progression was considered to have progressed on the date of death. For those who remained alive and did not progress, PFS was censored on the date of last evaluable TA, but if they had no recorded post-baseline TA, they were censored at the day of randomization. Progression prior to Week 12 did not constitute a PFS event if the patient showed a subsequent assessment of SD, PR or CR at week 12. Such patients were, however, counted progressors if they experienced progression at a visit subsequent to week 12. For patients who had surgical resection, only pre-surgical |TAs conducted on or prior to the date of surgery were considered in the determination of PFS. The primary assessment of PFS was based on review of lesion imaging data by the independent review committee (IRC).

Other secondary efficacy endpoints were: Survival rate, PFS rate at week 12, tumour response (CR, PR, SD or PD) based on assessment according to modified WHO criteria (mWHO), disease control rate defined as the number of patients whose BOR was PR, CR or SD, divided by the total number of randomized patients, best overall response rate defined as the number of patients whose BOR was PR or CR, divided by the total number of randomized patients, duration of response, time to response, duration of stable disease, brain metastasis-free status, immune-related response and Health-related Quality of Life (questionnaire C-30).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Progression-free survival and tumor response were evaluated by an IRC and investigators based on modified World Health Organization (mWHO) criteria. The assessment of the IRC was considered primary over that of the investigators. Response was also assessed using prespecified immune-related (ir) Response criteria that were developed, using mWHO as a foundation, to systematically categorize ipilimumab clinical activity before and after progression by mWHO. Response using both mWHO and irResponse criteria was determined by the IRC.

## Sample size

A total of 416 events from a sample size of 500 patients ensured 90% power to detect (using a logrank test at the two sided 0.05 significance level) an improvement in PFS equivalent to a HR of 0.727. The study similarly had 90% power to detect (also using a log-rank test at the two-side 0.05 significance level) an improvement in OS, equivalent to a HR of 0.727 (corresponding to an increase from 8 to 11 months in median OS).

Analyses of baseline characteristics and efficacy endpoints were based on all randomized patients and were performed using the treatment group as randomized, i.e., on an intent-to treat (ITT) basis.

The safety population is all treated patients who received at least 1 dose of ipilimumab or placebo and/or DTIC.

## Randomisation

A centralized randomization scheme was used to assign patients in a 1:1 ratio to the DTIC plus ipilimumab or DTIC plus placebo groups. The randomization was stratified to: 1) baseline M stage (M0 vs M1a vs M1b vs M1c), 2) ECOG performance status (0 vs 1) as determined at randomization, and 3) study site.

## Blinding (masking)

The sponsor, patient, and site staff were blinded with respect to the patient's treatment assignment. Local pharmacists and the CRO pharmacy monitors were unblinded. An independent Data Monitoring Committee had the possibility to access unblinded data in order to enable review of emerging safety data. In the event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual patient, the treating physician could be unblinded if knowledge of the investigational product was critical to the patients management.

## Statistical methods

The primary efficacy analysis was a log-rank test, stratified by baseline M-stage (M0 vs. M1a vs. M1b vs. M1c) and ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1) as defined at the time of randomization, to compare OS between treatment groups. A two-sided alpha of 0.05 was used. The HR of DTIC plus 10 mg/kg ipilimumab to DTIC with placebo and the corresponding two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by baseline M-stage (M0 vs. M1a vs. M1b vs. M1c) and ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1) as defined at the time of randomization, and with treatment as the single covariate.

For the secondary efficacy analyses, survival rates at 1 year, at 18 months, at 2 years (and at 3 years) were calculated for each treatment group using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. Corresponding two-sided 95% bootstrap CIs were calculated. Hierarchical tests were performed to compare the following secondary endpoints between treatment groups, with the order reflecting the hierarchy after the primary OS analysis: IRC-determined PFS, disease control rate and BORR. The comparison of IRCdetermined PFS between the treatment groups was conducted in a similar fashion to that for OS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

described above. For the comparisons of BORR and disease control rate between treatment groups, a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test with an associated odds ratio estimate and exact 95% CI, stratified by the factors noted above, was used. The duration of response in subjects with a confirmed response of CR or PR, estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method, was plotted. The time to response in subjects with a BOR of CR or PR was summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics.

## Recruitment

First Subject First Visit: 8 August 2006

Last Subject Last Visit for the Primary Endpoint: 7 February 2011

## Conduct of the study

In light of Phase 2 data that suggested that OS was the better endpoint to characterize efficacy, the primary endpoint of the study was changed from PFS to OS after a discussion and approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in October 2008. No changes to the statistical considerations were necessary as the study was already fully powered to assess OS.

## Baseline data

Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 9.

Most patients (&gt;98%) had normal WBC, ANC, and platelet results at baseline. Haemoglobin was normal in 77.9% of the patients, with Grade 2 abnormalities reported in 2.8% of the patients. Absolute lymphocyte count was normal in 58.4% of the patients, with Grade 2 and 3 abnormalities reported in 4.6% and 0.4% of patients respectively. No differences between treatment groups were noted.

Most patients (&gt;84%) had normal ALT, AST, ALP and bilirubin results at baseline. No differences between treatment groups were noted.

Most patients had normal pancreatic (&gt;92%) and renal (&gt;97%) function at baseline; no differences between treatment groups were noted.

The median time from initial pathological diagnosis of malignant melanoma to first dose of study therapy was 20.0 months.

The frequency of prior systemic was balanced between treatment groups (26.4% and 27% in ipilimumab+ DTIC group and DTIC monotherapy group, respectively). A total of 26.7% of patients received prior systemic therapy, nearly all of whom received a total of 1 regimen. The most common adjuvant therapies were interferon-containing regimens (114/133 patients). The most common reason for discontinuing prior therapy was disease progression (55 patients), followed by treatment completion (37 patients).

## Numbers analysed

A total of 502 subjects were randomized (250 to ipilimumab plus DTIC and 252 to DTIC monotherapy); 498 subjects were treated (247 to ipilimumab plus DTIC and 251 to DTIC monotherapy). Two subjects in the DTIC monotherapy group each erroneously received 1 dose of active ipilimumab instead of ipilimumab placebo.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Overall survival

The median OS was 11.2 months (95% CI; 9.4, 13.6) in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group and 9.1 months (95% CI: 7.8, 10.5) in the DTIC monotherapy group. The HR for comparison of OS between the groups was 0.72 (95%CI; 0.59, 0.87; p=0.0009), indicating a 28% risk reduction in OS for the ipilimumab plus DTIC group compared with the DTIC monotherapy group.

Overall survival for patients with disease control (patients with CR/PR/SD) was 28.7 months (95% CI: 23.8, ---) and 19.8 months (95% CI: 14.6, 28.2) in the ipilimumab plus DTIC and DTIC monotherapy groups respectively.

(1) 2-sided confidence interval calculated using the bootstrap method, based on Kaplan-Meier estimation

In each treatment group, the median OS was longer for those patients who received 4 induction doses of ipilimumab/placebo compared to those who received fewer doses, based on landmark analysis, which excluded patients who died (or who were censored) before the scheduled 4th induction dose. This explains the initial delay (up to Week 10) in the Kaplan-Meier plots before any deaths are observed.

In the DTIC monotherapy group, the median OS for patients who received 4 induction doses was 11.8 months (95% CI: 10.5m 13.9), compared to 5.3 months (95% CI: 3.9, 6.3) for those who received &lt; 4 doses, and 5.4 (95% CI: 4.1, 8.3) for those who received 3 doses.

The assessment of progression was based on the IRC database which was finalized (after at least 416 patients had progressed or died, as per original sizing assumptions) 15 months prior to the main database lock and are also presented in the figure below. Hence, the proportion of censored patients before 4 years in the PFS analysis is higher than in the OS analysis.

## Tumour response assessments using irRC criteria

The irRC are a refinement of the mWHO criteria to systematically capture tumor response in patients on immunotherapy. The irRC were created due to the distinct patterns of the clinical responses observed in patients treated with agents such as ipilimumab, patterns which exist in addition to conventional response patterns and are distinct from those seen in patients on chemotherapy.

Results of the irRC are in line with the results of the conventional methods.

## Ancillary analyses

Subgroup comparisons for OS were performed across the following pre-specified categories: M-stage, baseline LDH, age, female age, ECOG status, prior adjuvant tratement, race,and gender. M-stage and baseline LDH represent prognostic factors associated with poor clinical outcome in late -stage melanoma.

Results from most subgroup analyses demonstrated a consistent pattern with HRs favouring the ipilimumab plus DTIC group relative to the DTIC monotherapy group. However, for women above 50 years of age (HR 1.03), the data supporting an OS benefit of ipilimumab plus DTIC treatment were limited. The efficacy of ipilimumab plus DTIC for women above 50 years of age is therefore uncertain.

With regards to PFS, results from pre-specified subgroup analyses demonstrated a consistent pattern with HRs favoring the ipilimumab plus DTIC group relative to the TIC monotherapy group with the exception of baseline M1a (HR 1.04).

Results from prespecified subgroup analyses using mWHO criteria indicate responders in all subgroups, confirming clinical activity in all subgroups. The analyses demonstrated a consistent pattern with BORRs and DCRs numerically superior in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group relative to the DTIC monotherapy group in most case.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) and supportive studies

Studies with ipilimumab were conducted using the 3 and/or 10 mg/kg posology, and are summarised in Table 1.

In order to support the proposed 3 mg/kg posology recommendation, the MAH discussed these studies results and provided pooled analysis and comparison of results with reported with 3 mg/kg in previously treated vs previously untreated patients and of results in 3 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg.

## Comparison by prior therapy

For the efficacy studies submitted the OS after ipilimumab treatment for treatment naïve patients was compared to previously treated patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All randomized patients in the previously treated subgroups had received prior systemic therapies and many had received prior immunotherapies.

In each of the studies (MDX010-20, MDX010-08 and CA184004/022), nearly all (&gt;95%) randomized patients were treated with ipilimumab (alone or in combination with gp100 or DTIC). All treated patients were off treatment at the time of the analysis.

Although the total number of patients within each study is limited, the baseline demographics and patient characteristics were generally similar between previously untreated and previously treated patients.

Within each study, previously untreated and previously treated patients each received a median of 4 doses, with the exception of previously treated patients in MDX010-08 (median of 3 doses in the monotherapy group and 3.5 doses in the ipilimumab +DTIC group).

As indicated in the table below, results of median OS for previously treated patients were similar across studies. Results of median OS and estimated 1-year survival rates for previously untreated patients were similar to or numerically higher than those in previously treated patients in the MDX01020 study.

With some Phase 2 studies having only a few patients still at risk for death beyond 18 months (e.g., MDX010-08), the 2 year survival estimates for each study alone should be interpreted with caution.

## Overall survival by Prior therapy- MDX010-20

In the MDX010-20, OS benefit was observed regardless of the number of or type of prior anti-cancer systemic treatment. Specifically, OS benefit was observed for patients who did or did not have prior DTIC or non-DTIC chemotherapy or prior immunotherapy and for patients who had 1 or ≥2 prior line of therapy.

The treatment effect in favor of the 3 mg/kg ipilimumab group was observed across all prior therapy subgroups: in all cases, the 95% CI of HR estimates in all subgroups included in the HR estimate for the overall (intent-to-treat [ITT]) population (HR=0.66; 95% CI: 0.51-0.87). These results demonstrate that the performance of ipilimumab within these subgroups is favorable and thus consistent with the survival advantage demonstrated for the overall study population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Similar results were observed favoring in the ipilimumab 3 mg/kg + gp100 group vs the control group, where the 95% CI of HR estimates in all subgroups included the HR estimate for the overall (ITT) population (HR=0.68; 95% CI : 0.55-0.85).

## Pooled OS analysis for 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy

OS analysis of data from the ipilimumab monotherapy arms of MDX010-20, the pooled data of CA184004/022, and all pooled data provided an overall survival of about 9 months after initiation of the studies, providing a consistent result regarding OS after 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma (data not shown).

Comparison of survival in the pooled group of 35 previously untreated patients vs the pooled group of 254 previously treated patients are presented in the table and figure below.

The MAH also provided additional comparisons including results from two retrospective observational studies (CA184332 and CA184338) which included previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma who were treated with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab.

Although DTIC has never demonstrated an OS benefit, this medicine has historically been used as the reference arm in randomized melanoma trials. Based on the 5 most recent trials in previously untreated, advanced melanoma, a median OS of approximately 9 months and estimated 1-year OS rate of approximately 36% represents an appropriate historical benchmark for DTIC monotherapy. The median OS for DTIC monotherapy as reported in several previously published studies was between the 5.6 and 9.4 months (Patel et al., Eu J Cancer 2011, Middleton et al., J Clin Oncol 2000, Chapman et al., J Clin Onclol 1999, Avril et al., J Clin Oncol 2004).

A number of historical comparisons were provided. Key demographic and other baseline characteristics of the concerned studies are summarised in the table below.

## Comparison of Efficacy between 3 mg/kg Ipilimumab and 10 mg/kg Ipilimumab+DTIC

Two randomized Phase 3 trial of ipilimumab have demonstrated long-term OS benefit, confirming that ipilimumab is efficacious in previously untreated and previously treated advanced melanoma. In both

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

studies, the 2 year OS rates were similar despite different eligibility (treatment naïve or pre-treated) and different regimens (3mg/kg ipilimumab or 10 mg/kg ipilimumab +DTIC).

OS analyses from 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy (pooled) in previously untreated advanced melanoma demonstrate that 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy has at least similar OS (median, 1 year and 2 year) to the ipilimumab treated patients in the two randomized Phase 3 studies. Furthermore, in previously untreated patients, the median and long-term OS from 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy and 10 mg/kg ipilimumab + DTIC are similar and both are numerically higher than DTIC alone (median OS = 9.07 months; 1 yr: 36%, 2 yr: 18%).

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The phase 3 study CA184024 in which the efficacy of 10 mg/kg ipilimumab +DITC was compared to DTIC +placebo has been submitted to support the applied extension of indication of ipilimumab in previously untreated patients in addition to earlier data that have been obtained with the 3 mg/kg dose.

This additional study showed a statistically significant effect on OS, with a median OS with ipilimumab +DTIC of 11.2 months vs 9.1 months in DTIC monotherapy (HR 0.716 95% CI:0.588, 0.872; p=0.0009). The primary endpoint of overall survival and secondary endpoints were considered adequate. The results of the secondary endpoints were in line with the result of the primary endpoint and supported the increased efficacy of ipilimumab + DTIC treatment in comparison to DTIC monotherapy.

The observed OS benefit was consistent within most of the subgroups of patients. For women above 50 years of age the HR is just above 1, which is consistent with the results of MDX010-20 in which also a HR close to 1 for the subgroup of women above 50 years was found (see SmPC section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, the indicated OS benefit of 2.1 months for ipilimumab+DTIC treatment in comparison to DTIC monotherapy is considered clinically relevant. The obtained survival for the control group (DTIC+placebo) is relatively long, as previous studies have indicated a survival after the treatment with DTIC monotherapy 5.6 till 7.4 months. (Avril et al., J Clin Oncol. 2004; Bedikian et al., Ann Oncol. 2011).

No randomized studies comparing the efficacy of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy with DTIC in previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma have been submitted. Thus, a number of aspects related to clinical efficacy of ipilimumab in chemotherapy naïve patients have been discussed during the scientific evaluation, in particular, the use of DTIC as control arm in the pivotal study; the efficacy of the proposed dose of 3 mg/kg monotherapy compared to 10 mg/kg ipilimumab+ DTIC (used in the pivotal clinical trial CA184024).

## Use of DTIC as control arm in the pivotal study

Although DTIC has never demonstrated an OS benefit, in view of limited treatments being available, it is still commonly used in Europe as first line systemic therapy in advanced melanoma as it may achieve objective response rates of about 20% (Huncharek M. et al., Melanoma Res 2001; 11:75-81). Therefore, showing superiority of ipilimumab in combination with DTIC to DTIC + placebo was considered an acceptable study design to prove the efficacy of ipilimumab in chemotherapy naïve patients with advanced melanoma.

## Efficacy of the proposed dose of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy

The proposed monotherapy regimen can be supported based on the following arguments (see also Discussion on clinical pharmacology):

- The efficacy of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy has been established in previously treated melanoma patients;  the baseline characteristics of the patients included in the pivotal studies in previously treated and previously untreated subpopulations were similar (see Table 15 Clinical efficacy: Analysis performed across trials); the similar patient characteristics of the two trials support the relevance of the results observed in a previously treated population to the first-line setting.
- Ipilimumab PK was not significantly affected by concomitant dacarbazine, prior systemic anticancer therapy (see Clinical pharmacology; Population PK); thus, major differences in exposure between combination treatment and monotherapy or between pre-treated patients and nonpretreated patients are not expected. This supports the efficacy of ipilimumab monotherapy regardless of concomitant or prior DTIC treatment and the relevance of the results observed in a previously treated population to the first-line setting.
- Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg induced a sustained activation of T cells for both the untreated and previously treated subjects; co-administration of DTIC did not affect the increase in absolute lymphocyte count by ipilimumab (see Clinical pharmacology; Biomarker Analysis). There is no pharmacological or biological rationale to suspect a different activity for ipilimumab treatment in the first or the next line setting, because the mechanism of action of ipilimumab is general stimulation of the immune-system, which is rather aspecific.
- In historical comparisons, ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy was associated with an increase in median overall survival of at least 2.4 months compared to placebo + DTIC (see Clinical Efficacy, Table 16).
- Concomitant DTIC was associated with a markedly increased risk of having hepatobiliary irAEs (see Clinical Pharmacology; Exposure-Safety Response Analyses: immune related Adverse Event);The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

combination of 10 mg/kg of ipilimumab with DTIC was associated with treatment discontinuation due to study drug toxicity in 89 (36%) patients, and mean number of doses of 2.9 out of the planned 4 doses in the CA184024 study.

- Higher trough concentration at steady state (Cminss) was associated with increased toxicity (see Clinical Pharmacology; Exposure-Safety Response Analyses: immune related Adverse Event);

Overall, based on the evidence and arguments summarized above, the CHMP concluded that sufficient evidence of the efficacy of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in previously untreated patients has been provided.

At the time of the initial marketing authorization, the MAH was requested by the CHMP conduct a study on any relevant difference in efficacy between 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg (Study CA184169, postauthorisation measure as an obligation). This study will further clarify any differences in safety or efficacy between 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg monotherapy in previously untreated patients.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The efficacy of ipilimumab in previously untreated patients has been established.

The CHMP considers the ongoing post-authorisation measure to address issues related to efficacy of 3 mg/kg vs 10 mg/kg ipilimumab (study CA184169) was also applicable to this extension of indication.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

The safety population for the CA184024 study was defined as all treated patients. Unless otherwise specified overall safety is described based on events observed throughout the on-study period (defined as starting from the first date of induction dosing and ending at 70 days after the last dose of study therapy, including maintenance doses).

## Patient exposure

Of the 248 patient who received ipilimumab, 247 patients received at least 1 dose of ipilimumab as randomized. A total of 497 patients received DTIC in this study (ipilimumab plus DTIC , 246; DTIC 251).

The number of doses of ipilimumab or placebo and DTIC during the induction phase are presented respectively in the table below. Progressive disease was the most common reason for early drug discontinuation in both groups, followed by study drug toxicity in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group.

Patients without PD who continued to tolerate placebo or active ipilimumab were eligible to receive maintenance dosing. At least 1 maintenance dose of study therapy was received by 43 (17.4%) and 53 (21.1%) patients in the ipilimumab plus DTIC and DTIC monotherapy groups, respectively.

The median number of doses of ipilimumab received in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group in the maintenance phase was 4 (range: 1 to 14). Progressive disease was the most common reason for drug discontinuation in each group (60.5% and 77.4% in the ipilimumab plus DTIC and DTIC monotherapy groups, respectively).

The median number of doses of placebo received in the DTIC monotherapy group in the maintenance phase was 2 (rang: 1 to 14).

a On-study adverse events include all AEs reported between the first dose and 70 days after the last dose of study drug.

b Subject CA184024-115-24072 in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group had 2 Grade 5 AEs. 'Systemic inflammatory response syndrome' was considered a Grade 5 possibly related AE, and was considered ongoing at the time of death; an accompanying Grade 5 'pneumonia' was considered unlikely to be drug related, but was the precipitating event with an outcome of death. This death was classified by the investigator as 'other-pneumonia'.

The most common on study AEs (any grade an reported in ≥20% of the patients in any treatment group) were nausea (48.6% in each of the ipilimumab plus DTIC and DTIC groups) fatigue (41.7% vs 39.0%), Pyrexia (36.8% vs 9.2%), diarrhea (36.4% vs 24.7%), ALT increased (33.2% vs 5.6%), vomiting (31.6% vs 27.9%), pruritus (29.6 vs 8.8%), AST increased (29.1% vs 5.6%), constipation (28.3% vs 27.9%), rash (24.7 vs 6.8%), decreased appetite (21.9% vs 18.7%), and malignant neoplasm progression (14.2% vs 23.1%).

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Serious Adverse Events

A total of 68.8% of the patients in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group reported an SAE of any grade, compared to 48.2% of the patients in the DTIC group. Of the patients in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group 47.0% reported a drug-related SAE of any grade, compared to 6.8% of the patients in the DTIC group.

The most common drug-related SAEs reported in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group was increase ALT (any grade: 19.0%, Grade 3/4; 18.2%) and AST (any grade: 19.0%, Grade 3/4: 16.2%). Other SAEs reported in ≥patients included diarrhoea (6.5%) and pyrexia (5.7%). All drug-related SAEs in the DTIC group were reported in 1 (0.4%) patients each, except for pyrexia (3 patients 1.2%).

## On study AEs leading to discontinuation

On-study AEs resulting in discontinuation of study drug were reported in 46.2% of the patients in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group vs 18.3% in the DTIC group. Drug-related AEs resulting in discontinuation of study drug are presented in the below table. Events reported in ≥5% of the patients in either group included AST increase (any grade 17.0%, Grade 3/4: 15.0%) and AST increased (any grade: 16.6%, Grade 3/4: 15.4%) and were all reported in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group.

Subjects may have more than one event.

Drug related events are events with a relationship to study drug reported as 'Certain', 'Probable', 'Possible' or missing.

Adverse events leading to discontinuation are events with an action indicating discontinuation of study therapy. On-study events are events reported between first dose and 70 days after last dose of study therapy. Unknown intensities are included in \"Any Grade\" column.

## Death

A total of 193 (78.1%) of the patients in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group and 217 (86.5%) of the patients in the DTIC monotherapy group died. The majority of deaths were caused by disease progression. There were no drug-related AEs with the outcome of death in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group, and 1 (0.4%) in the DTIC group (GI hemorrhage). The cause of death was specified as 'other' for 9 3.6%) of the patients in each of the treatment groups. The class of 'other' included death due to; brainhemorrhage, acute myocardial infarction, apoplexy, pneumonia, hypertension and cerebrovascular ischemia, coronary arthrosclerosis, respiratory failure and surgical complications (all Ipilimumab + DTIC group), hepatocellular carcinoma, MI, suicide, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular ischemia, cardiopulmonary arrest and cardiopulmonary failure (all DTIC group). Most of these patients died more than 70 days after last dosing.

A total of 8 deaths (3 in the ipilimumab+DTIC and 5 in the DTIC monotherapy group) were due to unknown causes. All of these were post-study deaths (i.e., more than 70 days after last dose).

## Adverse Events of special interest: Immune-related Adverse Events (irAEs)

Ipilimumab is associated with inflammatory events resulting from increased or excessive immune activity, likely to be related to its mechanism of action. These events may involve the gastrointestinal, liver, skin, nervous, endocrine, or other organ system.

Immune-related AEs (irAEs) reported in Study CA184024 are summarised in the table below.

Includes blood, eye, immune system, infections, renal, and respiratory systems irAE = immune-related adverse event

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most frequently reported ir AEs in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group (≥20%) were diarrhea, ALT increased, AST increased, pruritus, and rash. The most frequently reported irAE in the DTIC group was diarrhea (15.9%).

Serious irAEs (any grade) were reported for 36.8% of the patients in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group and for 1.2% of the patients in the DTIC group.  Serious GI irAES were reported for 8.5% of the patients in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group vs 0.8% of the patients in the DTIC group. Serious events reported for more than 1 patients in either group were in the ipilimumab plus  DTIC group only and included diarrhea (6.5%) and colitis (3.2%).

Serious liver irAES were reported for 64 (25.9%) of the patients in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group vs 1 (0.4%, a Grade 3 event) in the DTIC group and included increase ALT (19.0%), increased AST (19.0%), autoimmune hepatitis (1.6%), Hepatitis (1.2%), hepatotoxicity (1.2%), increased gammaglutamyltransferase (1.2%) and increased blood bilirubin (0.8%).

The only on-study serious endocrine irAE was autoimmune thyroiditis reported in 1 patients in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group.

Serious skin irAEs were reported for 2 patients, both in the ipilimumab plus DTIC group and included pruritus and erythematous rash.

Other immune-related AE included hypersensitivity (6.1% vs 2.0%), increased lipase (2.8% vs 0.8%), eosinophilia (2.4% vs 1.2%), increased blood amylase (1.2% vs 0.8%), autoimmune disorder (0.8% vs 0%) and cytokine release syndrome (0.8% vs 0%)

a One subject had an ongoing Grade 2 skin event at baseline and an onset of a Grade 2 immune-related skin adverse reaction on study. This patient was included in the time to onset analysis (n=43). However, per the definition of resolution (return to baseline or Grade ≤ 1), this patient was not eligible for the analysis of resolution and is thus excluded (n=42).

## Safety 10 mg/kg ipilumumab monotherapy in comparison to 10 mg/kg ipilimumab+DTIC

A pooled analysis of the safety data obtained from studies using 10 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy (CA184004, CA184007, CA184008 and CA184022) was submitted during the initial application procedure. In comparison to 10 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy the incidence of nausea (16.3% vs 48.6%), vomiting (10.2% vs 31.6%), constipation (3.1% vs 28.3%) and fatigue (22.7% vs 41.7%) was considerable higher for patients treated with 10 mg/kg ipilimumab +DTIC.

Although direct comparison is difficult the frequency of SAE seemed to be comparable between the 10 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy and 10 mg/kg ipilimumab+DTIC. Also the incidence of treatment related death is not higher for patients treated with 10 mg/kg ipilimumab+DTIC than for patients treated with 10 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy (0% vs 2.8%). On the other hand the frequency of drug related adverse events leading to discontinuation is extremely high in for the 10 mg/kg ipilimumab+DTIC regimen in comparison to 3 mg/kg monotherapy but also to  10 mg/kg monotherapy (46.2% vs 9.9% vs 18.8%). Regarding the irAE, the events types and the frequency of irAE were according to the MAH similar for 10 mg/kg ipilimumab and for 10 mg/kg ipilimumab +DTIC, except for hepatic irAEs for which the incidence was higher with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg+DTIC than for ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy ore ipilimumab 10 mg/kg monotherapy.

## Comparison 3 mg/kg Ipilimumab monotherapy previously untreated and previously treated patients

The safety profile of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy in previously untreated patients (CA184338) was comparable to that observed with the same dose in chemotherapy-naïve patients (pooled analysis of chemotherapy-naive), and previously treated patients (MDX010-20). In all 3 groups, the incidence

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and severity of drug-related AEs and drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were generally similar (Table 31).

As in previously treated patients, the most frequent drug-related AEs were immune-related. The incidence and severity of irAEs reported in subjects treated with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab were similar between previously untreated, chemotherapy-naive, and previously treated, advanced melanoma patients (Table 32).

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

Safety data for 3 mg/kg ipilimumab in treatment naïve patients was provided by retrospective observational study CA184338. The key safety profile of the 3 mg/kg in previously untreated and previously treated patients seemed overall comparable. One-year interim safety data and final study results of these studies will be provided as additional pharmacovigilance activities from the risk management plan. Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect the additional data available from these studies and analyses.

Concerning the ipilimumab 10 mg/kg +DTIC regimen, reported AEs were known AEs for ipilimumab treatment and also reported in other studies using ipilimumab. The striking high percentage (46.2%) of AEs leading to drug discontinuation is indicative for severe toxicity of 10 mg/kg ipilimumab +DTIC treatment and the bad tolerance of patients regarding this treatment regime. A substantial part (31.2%) of the patients in the 10 mg/kg ipilimumab+DTIC arm did not receive more than two doses of ipilimumab, possibly decreasing the efficacy of the ipilimumab treatment.

As already seen in previous studies with ipilimumab, the majority of AEs are considered immune related. Particularly, the incidence of hepatitis was much higher in the patient group treated with 10 mg/kg ipilimumab+DTIC than in the treatment group treated with 3 mg/kg monotherapy ipilimumab. However, most of the AEs resolved after approximately 10 weeks. According to the applicant the irAE's are generally manageable and resolvable within 10 weeks (longest time to resolve hepatitis 9.9 weeks), in the majority of patients. Still the OS benefit of 10 mg/kg ipilimumab +DTIC was hardly longer than the time needed to recover from the AEs, by which the benefit of the treatment could be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

questioned regarding to quality of life. Analysis regarding the correlation between the occurrence of irAEs and OS suggest a positive relation. Although these results are considered reassuring, they are considered only hypothesis generating and no definitive conclusions can be drawn.  In contrast to other data of studies with ipilimumab, in spite of the high dose ipilimumab used, no treatment-related death was reported for the CA184024 study. Most likely this is due to an increased familiarity with managing immune-related toxicity; however this cannot be quantified.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety of ipilimumab treatment at 3 mg/kg in previously untreated patients appears similar to that of the currently approved previously treated patients population and is therefore acceptable.

The CHMP considers the ongoing post-authorisation measure to address issues related to safety of 3 mg/kg vs 10 mg/kg ipilimumab (study CA184169) was also applicable to this extension of indication.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

## PRAC Advice

The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC considered that the risk management system version 8.1 is acceptable. The PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached.

The CHMP endorsed this advice with changes.

These changes concerned the following elements of the Risk Management Plan:

- Addition of the 2 retrospective studies CA184332 and CA184338 to the pharmacovigilance plan

The CHMP justified these changes as follows:

The CHMP considered that the interim and final results of these studies in previously untreated patients would provide further information on the efficacy and safety profile in the target patient population at the proposed 3 mg/kg posology.

The MAH implemented the changes requested in the RMP (version 8.2) by PRAC and/or CHMP. The CHMP endorsed the changes to the Risk Management Plan with the following content:

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Editorial changes were also made to the SmPC and Package Leaflet.

No user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed for this extension of indication. This is acceptable as the extension of indication does not include major changes to the current package leaflet.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg efficacy in second line treatment was already established based on the phase III study MDX010-20 and is now as first line treatment supported by the two retrospective studies performed in patients with untreated advanced melanoma treated with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab, a median OS of 14.4 months (CA184332) and 11.5 months (CA184338) was observed. This would indicate an

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

improvement of at least 2.4 months compared to the patients in the control arm (placebo + DTIC) of the pivotal study CA184024.

The results from study CA184024, in which the efficacy of ipilimumab in previously untreated patients was investigated, showed an OS benefit of 2.1 months for patients treated with 10 mg/kg ipilimumab + DTIC in comparison to DTIC monotherapy (i.e. 11.2 months OS [95% CI of 9.4-13.6] vs. 9.1 months OS [95% CI of 7.75-10.51], HR 0.716 95% CI (0.588, 0.872); p=0.0009). This benefit in OS of ipilimumab treatment was consistent in most of the subgroups related to prognosis (i.e. race, age, M-stage, performance score (PS; ECOG) and baseline LDH). The results of this study were considered to support the efficacy of ipilimumab  in previously untreated patients. Furthermore, exploratory analyses of the role of prior treatment did not reveal any important interaction. Clinical pharmacology data supported similar pharmacokinetics for previously treated and previously untreated patients, and was unaffected by dacarbazine. Thus, the efficacy of the ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy regimen in previously untreated patients was considered established (see Discussion on Clinical Efficacy).

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Although efficacy is considered established for the 3 mg/kg dose, it is important to clarify any differences in efficacy (and safety) between 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg monotherapy in previously untreated patients. Study CA184169 was requested by the CHMP as an obligation to conduct postauthorisation measure at the time of the initial marketing authorisation is expected to address this issue.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Safety data for previously untreated patients treated with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab were obtained mostly by the retrospective study CA184338:  54.2% of the patients experienced drug-related adverse events, in 16.2% of patients this was ≥ grade 3. In 9.2% of the patients, drug-related adverse events led to drug discontinuation. Comparable results were observed in the previously treated patients group (study MDX010-20), although more patients experienced drug related adverse event (78.2%, 20.6% patients ≥grade 3). In 9.9 % of patients a drug related event led to study discontinuation.

As in previously treated patients, the most frequent drug-related AEs were immune-related, although a lower incidence of drug-related AEs during induction was observed in the pooled chemotherapy-naïve and previously untreated patients compared to previously treated patients (52.5% vs. 61.8%). A lower incidence of skin irAEs in previously untreated patients (CA184388) compared to pooled chemotherapy-naive and previously treated patients was 27.5% vs. 52.0% and 41.2%, respectively. Finally, there were no deaths due to drug-related AEs or irAEs in previously untreated patients (CA184338), while the reported incidence was 2.7% in the pooled chemotherapy-naïve patients population and 3.1% in the previously treated patient population.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The key safety profile of the 3 mg/kg in previously untreated and previously treated patients seems overall comparable. However, additional safety data from all patients in both CA184332 and CA184338 and information on the safety profile of ipilimumab in previously treated vs previously untreated patients in pooled Phase 2/3 clinical trials will be reported as per the pharmacovigilance plan and PSUR as applicable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

For patients with advanced melanoma without BRAF mutation currently only DTIC is approved as first line treatment from which only a limited increase in PFS can be expected.

Efficacy of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab in second line treatment was already proven by the phase III MDX01020 study. From a pharmacological or biological point of view it is not rational to suspect a different activity for ipilimumab treatment in the first or the next line setting, because the mechanism of action of ipilimumab is general stimulation of the immune-system, which is rather aspecific. Efficacy of 3 mg/kg ipilimuamb in previously untreated patients was supported by two retrospective studies performed in patients with untreated advanced melanoma treated with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab, a median OS of 14.4 months (CA184332) and 11.5 months (CA184338) was observed. An overall survival benefit has never been shown with DTIC, while the median OS observed with ipilimumab is consistently at least &gt; 2 months longer regardless of the line of therapy used as shown by the results from the pivotal and the supportive studies. The efficacy of the 10 mg/kg ipilimumab + DTIC regimen in the CA184024 study was considered to support the efficacy of ipilimumab in previously untreated patients.

The data of the retrospective observational studies are useful for assessing the safety of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab for the treatment of previously untreated patients. Based on the data provided, the results do not indicate additional safety issues for first line ipilimumab in comparison to second line ipilimumab treatment for key safety issues.

## Benefit-risk balance

Based on the clinically relevant effect on overall survival and the acceptable safety profile the benefit risk balance of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg as monotherapy is considered to be positive for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

Overall, the benefit/risk of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab treatment in patients with advanced melanoma without restriction regarding the line of treatment is considered positive. Estimation of the effect in previously untreated patients was based on several factors; similarity between patient characteristics of previously treated and untreated patients, the pharmacological rationale assuming similar activity for ipilimumab in different treatment setting and consistent beneficial effect on OS in comparison to DTIC observed in the clinical trials regardless the line of therapy.

Regarding the safety, the data from the observational studies increase the database for safety considerably and indicate a similar safety profile for first and second line ipilimumab treatment (3 mg/kg). The safety of the 3 mg/kg dose appears more acceptable than that of the 10 mg/kg dose.
