## 1. Introduction

The MAH submitted the completed paediatric study AI424452 for Reyataz hard capsules, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Study AI424452 started in November 2012 and completed on 20-Feb-2017. Study AI424452 was a post-approval commitment safety study for the US FDA to assess the safety of ATV capsules boosted with RTV (ATV/RTV) administered with an optimized nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) background therapy in patients ≥ 6 to &lt; 18 years of age and weighing ≥ 15 kg. The study was to provide confirmatory safety data through 24 weeks of study treatment for ATV/RTV at the recommended doses approved in the United States (US) in 2008 and the European Union (EU) in 2010 (ATV 150, 200 and 300 mg, each with RTV 100 mg, for 15 to &lt; 20 kg, 20 to &lt; 40 kg, and ≥ 40 kg weight groups, respectively). Atazanavir paediatric dosing recommendations were later revised in the EU in 2016 and in the US in 2017. The approved dosing recommendations used in Study AI424452 were those in effect at the time of the study and therefore are not consistent with the current posology of Reyataz in US and EU (see below the current approved posology).

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

In this study, all subjects received ATV capsules boosted with RTV tablets or capsules administered according approved paediatric dosing recommendations at the time of the study (ATV/RTV 150/100, 200/100 and 300/100 mg for 15 to &lt; 20 kg, 20 to &lt; 40 kg, and ≥ 40 kg weight groups, respectively).

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for study AI424452. This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label study evaluating the safety of ATV capsules boosted with RTV capsules or tablets administered once daily (QD) with an optimized background therapy of 2 NRTIs in HIV-infected antiretroviral (ARV)-naive or -experienced paediatric subjects ≥ 6 to &lt; 18 years of age. Subjects were enrolled from South Africa, South America countries, US and Russia.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Study AI424452

## Methods

## Objective

Primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  ATV  capsule  boosted  with  RTV-based regimens in paediatric subjects ≥ 6 years to &lt; 18 years of age dosed for 24 weeks.

## Study design

This is a Phase 4 ongoing prospective single-arm, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety of ATV capsule boosted with RTV capsules or tablets QD with an optimized background therapy of 2 NRTIs in HIV-infected, ARV-naive and -experienced pediatric subjects ≥ 6 years to &lt; 18 years of age, and ≥ 15 kg.

Treatment-experienced subjects were defined by previous exposure to ARV drugs through either prior treatment for their HIV infection, or through post-natal treatment with ≥ 1 ARV as part of the prevention of mother-to-child transmission. For the purposes of this study, subjects exposed to ARVs in utero or intra-partum were eligible for the study, but were considered treatment naive. Eligible subjects were required to have a screening HIV viral load of ≥ 1000 copies/mL (ARV-naive) or ≥ 400 copies/mL (ARV-experienced). Subjects at screening were to have genotypic sensitivity (ARV-naïve subjects) or genotypic and phenotypic sensitivity (ARV-experienced subjects) to ATV and at least 2 NRTIs approved for pediatric use per the local country label.

All subjects received ATV capsules boosted with RTV tablets or capsules administered according approved pediatric dosing recommendations at the time of the study (ATV/RTV 150/100, 200/100 and 300/100 mg for 15 to &lt; 20 kg, 20 to &lt; 40 kg, and ≥ 40 kg weight groups, respectively). The NRTI backbone consisted of 2 NRTIs locally approved for pediatric use at doses specified in the country's label(s). Subjects were dosed for a minimum of 24 weeks. However, in countries where there is no locally approved pediatric indication for ATV capsule, subjects may continue on study treatment and have regular 12-week study visits.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Safety variables included deaths, adverse events (AEs) (serious and nonserious), including Other Significant Adverse Events and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Class C acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) events, concomitant medication use, laboratory measurements, and electrocardiogram (ECG) results. Class C AIDS events were assessed only through Week 24.

## Statistical Methods

No statistical comparisons between weight bands were conducted, and only summary statistics are presented. Categorical variables are summarized with counts and percents or with proportions (number with event divided by number evaluable) and percents. Continuous variables are summarized with univariate statistics.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Results

## Recruitment/Number analysed

Fifty-nine subjects were treated. Fifty-three (89.8%) subjects completed 24 weeks of study treatment. Forty-seven (79.7%) subjects continued in the study after Week 24, and 30 of them completed the study.

[1] Can include subjects who either completed or discontinued phase 1

[2] Note that Table 1 reports incorrectly that 18 subjects (30.5%) did not complete the study. However, 1 subject is counted in error in the end of study analysis as continuing after Week 24 and discontinuing due to lack of efficacy This subject completed Week 24 but did not continue after Week 24 due to lack of efficacy

## Baseline data

Most subjects (50.8%) were female; 59.3% were Black/African American, and 57.6% were from South Africa. Of the 59 treated subjects, 32 (54.2%) were ARV-naive and 27 (45.8%) were ARV-experienced. The overall median baseline HIV RNA was 4.05 log10 c/mL; 15% of subjects had HIV RNA &gt; 100,000 c/mL. The overall median CD4 count was 390 cells/mm3, and the median CD4% was 19%.

## Safety results

## Exposure

The mean time on ATV/RTV treatment at the time of the Week 24 primary analysis was 37, 47, and 38 weeks in the 15 to &lt; 20 kg, 20 to &lt; 40 kg, and ≥ 40 kg weight groups, respectively. By the end of the study, the mean time on ATV/RTV therapy was 109, 102, and 65 weeks in the 15 to &lt; 20 kg, 20 to &lt; 40 kg, and ≥ 40 kg weight groups, respectively. The shorter exposure in the ≥ 40 kg weight group in the  end-of-study  analysis  reflects the  fact  that  subjects  in  this  weight  group  were  older  at  baseline than the other 2 groups (11 of the 23 subjects in the ≥ 40 kg weight group were at least 16 years of age at baseline) and reached 18 years of age and completed earlier than subjects in the lower (and younger) baseline weight groups.

Lamivudine  tablet  was  the  most  common  medication  in  the  NRTI  backbone  both  at  Week  24  (31 subjects) and at the end of the study (33 subjects). Other common medications in the NRTI backbone were  abacavir  tablets,  tenofovir  tablets,  and  zidovudine  tablets.  The  mean  daily  doses  of  NRTI medications were consistent with pediatric dose recommendations in the respective product labels.

## Overall safety summary

The overall safety profile at Week 24 of ATV capsules boosted with RTV in pediatric subjects ≥ 6 and &lt; 18 years of age was similar to that observed in previous ATV pediatric and adult studies. No safety finding  was  identified  in  this  pediatric  population  that  had  not  been  reported  previously  in  other pediatric and adult studies of ATV.

a Week 24 results are through Week 24; EOS results are cumulative from Day 1 to the end of the study

b Week 24 results are through database lock for the Week 24 CSR; EOS results are cumulative from Day 1 to the end of the study

ALT = alanine aminotransferase, DILI=drug induced liver injury

The most common AEs (≥ 10% across weight groups) through Week 24 were nasopharyngitis (16.9%), upper respiratory tract infection (16.9%), vomiting (16.9%), cough (13.6%), abdominal pain (11.9%), hyperbilirubinemia (11.9%), and influenza, nausea, and jaundice (each 10.2%).

Hyperbilirubinemia was the most common Grade 3 to 4 AE, occurring in 3 (5.1%) subjects, 2 (6.1%) in the 20 to &lt; 40 kg weight group and 1 (4.3%) in the ≥ 40 kg weight group, all with Grade 3 events. All other Grade 3 to 4 AEs occurred in only 1 subject per AE term (neutropenia, overdose, and post

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

procedural haemorrhage in the 20 to &lt; 40 kg weight group; and abdominal pain, ALT increased, appendicitis, blood bilirubin increased, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypersensitivity in the ≥ 40 kg weight group). No Grade 3 to 4 rash and no Grade 3 to 4 cardiac events were reported.

## Deaths and SAEs

One subject died during Year 2 (bacterial meningitis not considered related to the study therapy).

Overall, the cumulative incidence of SAEs was 8 (13.6%) subjects (0, 1, 3, and 4 subjects in the 15 to &lt; 20 kg, 20 to &lt; 40 kg, and ≥ 40 kg weight groups, respectively). Other than overdose, which was reported as an SAE in 2 subjects as accidental overdose and overdose, respectively, none of the ontreatment SAEs occurring in this study was reported for more than 1 subject per AE term; no SAE was considered  by  the  investigators  to  be  related  to  study  treatment;  and  none  led  to  treatment discontinuation.

## AEs leading to discontinuation

The cumulative incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was 3 (5.1%) subjects: 1 in the 20 to &lt; 40 kg  weight  group  (Grade  1  pulmonary  tuberculosis)  and  2  in  ≥  40  kg  weight  group  (Grade  3  acute allergic systemic reaction considered related to study drug and resolved off treatment, and one Grade 2 tuberculosis of the eye).

## AEs of interest

-  Hyperbilirubinemia: Through Week 24 database lock, 13 (22.0%) subjects had hyperbilirubinemiarelated AEs (0, 3 [9.1%] and 10 [43.5%] in the 15 to &lt; 20 kg, 20 to &lt; 40 kg, and ≥ 40 kg weight groups,  respectively).  Most  hyperbilirubinemia  AEs  were  Grade  2  to  4  (9  of  the  13  subjects).  Four additional subjects had hyperbilirubinemia events (Grade 1 to 3) after the Week 24 database lock. All except 1 were considered related to study drug.

- Renal toxicity: One subject (20 to &lt; 40 kg weight group) had a Grade 1 hematuria on Day 421 that was  considered  not  related  to  the  study  drug  by  the  investigator.  This  subject  subsequently experienced 3 renal SAEs (hematuria on Day 665, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis on Day 695, and  glomerulonephritis  on  Day  865),  a  non-serious  AEs  of  nephrotic  syndrome  (Day  787)  and proteinuria on Day 1177. None of these AEs or SAE was considered related to the study drug by the investigator.

- Cardiac disorders: Through the Week 24 database lock, 6 (10.2%) subjects had cardiac disorders. Four  subjects  (20  to  &lt;  40  kg  group)  had,  respectively,  first  degree  atrioventricular  (AV)  block  (2 subjects, and one of the two also had sinus bradycardia), AV block (1 subject), and sinus bradycardia (1 subject). The first degree AV block in 1 of the 2 subjects with this event, and the AV block in 1 subject were each considered related to the study drug by the investigators. Two subjects (≥ 40 kg group)  had  AEs  of  sinus  bradycardia  that  were  considered  unrelated  to  the  study  drug  by  the investigators, and the subjects continued on treatment. After Week 24, through the end of the study, a cardiac AE (Grade 1 sinus tachycardia) was reported for 1 additional subject (≥ 40 kg group), which was considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator.

- Rash: Seven (11.9%) subjects had rash events (4 in the 20 to &lt;40 kg group and 3 in the ≥ 40 kg group). None of these events was considered related to the study drug by the investigators. No Grade 3 or Grade 4 AE was reported in the SOC of Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  AIDS  events:  1  subject  (20  to  &lt;  40  kg  group)  had  Grade  1  pulmonary  tuberculosis  that  was considered not related to the study drug by the investigator.

No on-treatment events of lipodystrophy,  lactic  acidosis  syndrome or  symptomatic  hyperlactatemia, cholelithiasis, or nephrolithiasis were reported at any time during the study.

## Laboratory AEs

The majority of subjects had normal serum chemistries, except for amylase (72.9%), low bicarbonate (71.2%) and total bilirubin (62.7%), which were abnormal at any grade level across all weight groups. Grade 3 to 4 abnormalities were infrequent except for total bilirubin and amylase:

Two subjects, both in the ≥ 40 kg weight group, had ALT and total bilirubin measurements that met laboratory criteria for potential DILI (ALT or AST &gt; 3x ULN with concurrent total bilirubin &gt; 2x ULN) during the first 24 weeks of the study.

## 2.3.3. MAH's discussion

The benefit-risk profile for ATV paediatric capsules has not changed. In the post-approval commitment safety study AI424452, ATV capsules, boosted with RTV capsules or tablets, administered with 2 NRTIs using  the  approved  dosing  recommendations,  were  generally  safe  and  well  tolerated  across  all  3 weight bands through 24 weeks of treatment (the primary endpoint) and through the end of the study. There were no unexpected or novel safety events. No safety findings were identified in this pediatric population that had not been reported previously in other ATV pediatric and adult studies, or that merit an update to the product information.

## 3. Overall conclusion and recommendation

In 2010, an extension of indication for atazanavir (Reyataz hard capsules) was accepted (variation II57) to include HIV-1 infected paediatric patients 6 years of age. Study AI424452 was a PostAssessment Measure (PAM) initiated in 2012 in order to consolidate the safety data of Reyataz in the paediatric subjects. Therefore, the posology and the formulations of Reyataz in this study were those adopted at the time of its initiation.

In  2016  through  the  procedure  EMEA/H/C/494/X/94/G,  the  posology  of  Reyataz  hard  capsules  in paediatric  subjects  (≥  6  years  and  weighing  at  least  15  kg)  was  modified,  and  a  new  formulation (Reyataz oral powder) was authorised for younger paediatric subjects (≥ 3 months of age).

| Old paediatric dosage of Reyataz capsules (+RTV)   | Current paediatric dosage of Reyataz capsules (+RTV)   |
|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| ≥15 kg to <20 kg: 150/100 mg QD                    | ≥15 kg to <35 kg: 200/100 mg QD                        |
| ≥20 kg to <40 kg: 200/100 mg QD                    | ≥35 kg: 300/100 mg QD                                  |
| ≥40 kg: 300/100 mg QD                              |                                                        |

For  a  similar  weight,  the  ATV  exposure  may  be  higher  with  the  current  dosage  of  Reyataz  in comparison  to  the  dosage  in  study  AI424452.  Therefore,  the  final  results  of  study  AI424452  have become outdated. However, it is noted that no new safety signal was highlighted within this study. We agree with the MAH that the safety profile in this paediatric study is overall similar with those in adults.

In conclusion, no additional recommendation or variation could be issued from this final report of study AI424452.
