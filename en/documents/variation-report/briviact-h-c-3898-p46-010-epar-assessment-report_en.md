## 1. Introduction

On July 4 th  2022, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for brivarecetam, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006,  as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that Open-Label, Single-Arm, Multicenter, Long-Term Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Brivaracetam Used as Adjunctive Treatment in Pediatric Subjects with Epilepsy (N01266)  is part of a clinical development program.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Brivaracetam (tablet and oral solution) was administered bid approximately 12 hours apart in 2 equally divided doses. Study participants were dosed with either oral tablets or oral solution and not a combination of both. The mg dosage for the oral tablet treatment was calculated to match as closely as possible the mg/kg-based dosage and was a combination of the BRV 10mg, 25mg, and 50mg tablets. Only the following exact dosages were allowed for the oral tablet administration: BRV 20, 40, 50, 70, 100, 150, and 200mg/day.

The dose of oral solution was measured using the appropriate syringes (1mL, 3mL, and/or 10mL) with an adaptor able to fit both bottle sizes. Oral solution should not have been mixed with other liquids prior to administration.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report(s) for:

- N01266 - Open-Label, Single-Arm, Multicenter, Long-Term Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Brivaracetam Used as Adjunctive Treatment in Pediatric Subjects with Epilepsy

N01266 - Open-Label, Single-Arm, Multicenter, Long-Term Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Brivaracetam Used as Adjunctive Treatment in Pediatric Subjects with Epilepsy

## Description

N01266 was a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, LTFU study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BRV in study participants with epilepsy.

Upon enrollment, eligible LTFU study participants entered the Evaluation Period and continued their BRV treatment in accordance with their individualized dose at the completion of the core study. Directly enrolled (DE) study participants were screened and participated in up to 3 weeks of an Up Titration Period. If a DE study participant demonstrated, in the opinion of the Investigator, acceptable

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tolerability and seizure control on the same daily dose of BRV (no lower than the minimum specified dose) for 7±2 days during the Up-Titration Period, the study participant attended the Entry Visit (EV) and entered the Evaluation Period on that dose.

For LTFU study participants, the EV was the first study visit. For DE study participants, the EV was the visit at which study participants entered the Evaluation Period and occurred after study participants completed the Screening Visit (ScrV) and at least 1 Titration Visit (TV). For study participants who continued in the study until it ended, the Evaluation Period extended from the EV to the Final Visit (FV). For study participants who prematurely discontinued the study, the Evaluation Period lasted from the EV until the Early Discontinuation Visit (EDV). Following the EDV or following the FV for study participants who completed the study but did not continue BRV treatment, study participants had their BRV dose reduced by a maximum of half the dose every week for a maximum of 4 weeks until a dose of 1mg/kg/day (50mg/day for study participants with body weights &gt;50kg) was reached (DownTitration Period). After 2 weeks free of IMP (Safety Period), study participants completed the Safety Visit (SV).

## Methods

## Study participants

Overall, it was planned that approximately 600 study participants would be enrolled in N01266 from a core study; however, study participants from study N01269 were not rolled over to N01266, and studies N01265 and N01268 were not conducted. Therefore, the anticipated number of LTFU study participants for N01266 was approximately 270.

Study participants who enrolled in N01266 from a core study (ie, LTFU study participants from other BRV studies N01263, EP0065, or N01349) must have been ≥ 1 month to &lt;16 years of age upon entry in the core study; eligible study participants who had POS and enrolled in N01266 without having participated in a core study (ie, directly enrolled [DE] study participants) must have been ≥ 4 years to &lt;17 years of age.

Below are some key Inclusion criteria for DE study participants only:

8. Study participant was a male or female ≥ 4 years to &lt;17 years of age.
9. Study participant had a clinical diagnosis of POS according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification.
10. Study participant had an EEG compatible with the clinical diagnosis of POS.
11. Study participant had been observed to have uncontrolled POS after an adequate course of treatment (in the opinion of the Investigator) with at least 1 AED (concurrently or sequentially).
12. Study participant had at least 1 seizure (POS) during the 3 weeks before the ScrV.
13. Study participant was taking at least 1 AED. All AEDs needed to be at a stable dose for at least 7 days before the ScrV. Vagal nerve stimulator stable for at least 2 weeks before the ScrV was allowed and was counted as a concomitant AED. Benzodiazepines taken more than once a week (for any indication) were considered as a concomitant AED.

## CHMP comments

In general, the study population included in this study was similar to the one defined in the authorized indication with the exception of some patients from LTFU part (from EP0065 and N01349),  which were younger.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

Immediate-release BRV oral solution and immediate-release, film-coated BRV oral tablets were provided during the study.

Brivaracetam oral solution, at a concentration of 10mg/mL, was supplied in 300mL glass bottles.

Brivaracetam oral tablets were provided in the following strengths: 10mg, 25mg, and 50mg.

There was no placebo or reference product.

Brivaracetam (tablet and oral solution) was administered bid approximately 12 hours apart in 2 equally divided doses. Study participants were dosed with either oral tablets or oral solution and not a combination of both. The mg dosage for the oral tablet treatment was calculated to match as closely as possible the mg/kg-based dosage and was a combination of the BRV 10mg, 25mg, and 50mg tablets. Only the following exact dosages were allowed for the oral tablet administration: BRV 20, 40, 50, 70, 100, 150, and 200mg/day.

For all study participants enrolled in N01266, the maximum BRV dose was 5.0mg/kg/day (2.5mg/kg bid), not to exceed a dose of 200mg/day. Dose adjustments of BRV and/or concomitant antiepileptic drugs [AEDs] were allowed at any time based on clinical judgment; however, during the Up Titration Period, dose adjustments for BRV should have been made only as specified in the protocol.

## Objective(s)

The primary objective of N01266 was to document the long-term safety and tolerability of BRV.

The secondary objective of N01266 was to assess the efficacy of BRV during long term exposure.

The following other objectives were studied in N01266:

- To explore direct cost parameters
- To assess the effect of BRV on behavior using the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) in study participants ≥ 18 months of age
- To explore the effect of BRV on cognition using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function® Preschool Version/Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function® (BRIEF® P/BRIEF®) in study participants ≥ 2 years of age
- To assess the effect of BRV on cognition using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development®, Third Edition (Bayley-III®) in study participants &lt;18 months of age (applicable only to long-term follow-up [LTFU] study participants enrolled in English-speaking countries and countries where a validated translation was available)
- To explore the effect of BRV on health-related quality of life using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory ™ (PedsQL ™ ) in study participants ≥ 2 years of age

## CHMP comments

The study objectives primarily focused on long-term safety of treatment and are acceptable.

## Recruitment

Overall, 264 study participants enrolled in the study and 257 study participants (97.3%) were included in the SS, including 127 study participants in the DE cohort and 137 study participants in the LTFU cohort. Seven DE study participants (5.5%) were screen failures.

The number of study participants varied across age groups: 36 study participants in the ≥ 1 month to &lt;2 years age group, 15 study participants in the ≥ 2 to &lt;4 years age group, 141 study participants in the ≥ 4 to &lt;12 years age group, and 65 study participants in the ≥ 12 to &lt;17 years age group. Due to the low number of participants in the ≥ 1 month to &lt;2 years and ≥ 2 to &lt;4 years age groups, any comparison of data across age groups should be made with caution (Table 5 1).

A total of 124 study participants (48.2%) completed the study (Table 5 1), 65 participants (47.4%) in the LTFU cohort and 59 participants (49.2%) in the DE cohort (N01266 CSR Table 1.2.2). Eighteen participants (50.0%) in the ≥ 1 month to &lt;2 years age group, 4 participants (26.7%) in the ≥ 2 to &lt;4 years age group, 65 participants (46.1%) in the ≥ 4 to &lt;12 years age group, and 37 participants (56.9%) in the ≥ 12 to &lt;17 years age group completed the study (Table 5 1).

The most frequently reported seizures at Baseline were classified as complex partial (144 study participants [56.0%]), followed by partial evolving to secondary generalized (112 study participants [43.6%]). A total of 66 study participants (25.7%) had generalized seizures; the most frequently reported seizures at Baseline were myoclonic (30 study participants [11.7%]), followed by tonic (23 study participants [8.9%]). A total of 12 study participants (4.7%) had a seizure profile classified as unclassifiable (Table 5 5).

A greater proportion of study participants in the ≥ 2 to &lt;4 years (66.7%), ≥ 4 to &lt;12 years (85.8%), and ≥ 12 to &lt;17 years (86.2%) of age groups had a POS profile at Baseline compared with study participants in the ≥ 1 month to &lt;2 years of age group (58.3%); this would be expected given the study was designed to enroll more study participants with POS in the ≥ 4 years age groups (DE study participants must have been ≥ 4 years to &lt;17 years of age [Section 1.3.3]). A greater proportion of study participants in the ≥ 1 month to &lt;2 years (36.1%) and ≥ 2 to &lt;4 years (60.0%) age groups had a

Note: Seizures experienced at any time prior to study entry were summarized.

Note: The history of epilepsy used eCRF information collected at the time of entry into the core studies for LTFU study participants or at the time of entry into N01266 for DE study participants.

Note: The percentages may add to more than 100% as study participant may have been represented in more than 1 category.

Data source: N01266 CSR Table 5.2.1

A greater proportion of POS study participants had localization-related epileptic syndromes (163/185 study participants [88.1%]) at Baseline compared with PGS study participants and study participants with primary generalized seizure excluding typical absence (PGS*; 10/68 study participants [14.7%] and 10/66 study participants [15.2%], respectively). Whereas a greater proportion of PGS and PGS* study participants had generalized epileptic syndromes (54/68 study participants [79.4%] and 52/66 study participants [78.8%], respectively) at Baseline compared with POS study participants (9/185 study participants [4.9%]).

## CHMP comments

The largest group of patients included into the study was 4-12 years old. The majority of patients were coming from Europe with the largest group coming from East Europe (38%).

Most common were complex partial seizures (56%) and the most common type of PGS seizures were myoclonic seizures (30%).

Overall, 252 study participants (98.1%) reported taking at least 1 AED medication at entry into the core study for LTFU study participants and at entry into N01266 for DE study participants. The majority of study participants reported taking 3 or fewer AEDs at study entry: 68 participants (26.5%) reported taking 1 AED, 107 participants (41.6%) reported taking 2 AEDs, and 58 participants (22.6%) reported taking 3 AEDs at study entry. The most commonly reported AEDs taken at study entry were valproate (117 study participants [45.5%]), topiramate (55 study participants [21.4%]), and clobazam (48 study participants [18.7%]).

The concomitant AEDs used by ≥ 10% of all study participants are summarized in Table 7-10.

## CHMP comments

It is noted that rather large proportion of patients had prior use of levetiracetam reported (44%) as well as valproate (38%).

The most common concomitant ASD was valproate (50%), especially in the youngest patients ( ≥ 1 month to &lt; 2 years) - increase from 16.7% to 50%. It is also noted that percentage of patients using at least 1 ASD as a concomitant treatment was similar (99.2%) to the proportion of patients using at least one ASD at the study entry (98.1%) which was higher compared to prior use of ASD (78.6%). Having in mind that study entry for LTFU study participants was defined as the time of entry into the previous core study and for direct enrolled (DE) study participants it was time of entry into N01266, the increased use of concomitant ASD medications complicates interpretation of efficacy results.

## Number analysed

Overall, 257 study participants (97.3%) of the 264 study participants enrolled received at least 1 dose of BRV and were included in the SS; 7 DE study participants (5.5%) were screen failures. In addition, 257 study participants (97.3%) had a Baseline and at least 1 completed post-Baseline DRC or EEG and were included in the FAS.

Note: Because percent change cannot be calculated for participants with 0 Baseline ADF, n's for absolute change and percent change may differ and do not necessarily capture the same participants.

Note: Seizure category at Baseline according to N01266 SAP Section 3.10.3.

Note: Change is defined as decrease in 28-day adjusted POS frequency compared with Baseline.

Note: EP0065 and N01349 participants did not provide appropriate Baseline data and were excluded in the planned analyses.

Data source: N01266 CSR Table 7.6.2

Overall, study participants ≥ 2 years of age with POS reported a median (minimum, maximum) absolute change in POS frequency from Baseline over the Evaluation Period of 7.09 (7075.3, 721.9) per 28 day period and a median (minimum, maximum) percent change in POS frequency of 62.92% (-693.7%, 100.0%) per 28-day period. The large median absolute and percent change values during Months 1 to 3 are due, in part, to a small number of study participants such as Study Participant who had seizure frequencies of 1020.0 at Baseline, 356.0 at Up-Titration, and 8095.3 over the Evaluation Period, resulting in the absolute and percent changes from Baseline of  7075.3 and  693.7%, respectively. The study participant received BRV treatment for 106 days before discontinuing the study due to lack of efficacy.

## 50% responder rate for total seizures

A summary of the responder rate for all study participants ≥ 2 years of age during the Evaluation Period based on DRC data is presented for the FAS in Table 4 2. Note that study participants who had no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

seizures at Baseline and post-Baseline were regarded as 'not evaluable' for the responder assessment because these participants already had the minimum possible number of seizures.

Overall, 81 study participants (50.9% of all evaluable participants ≥ 2 years of age) were responders during the Evaluation Period (defined as participants with a ≥ 50% reduction in the number of seizure days, standardized to a 28 day duration, based on the DRC data). This included 61 study participants with POS (48.4% of evaluable participants ≥ 2 years of age with POS) and 20 study participants with primary generalized seizures (PGS) (60.6% of evaluable participants ≥ 2 years of age with PGS).

## CHMP comments

In patients ≥ 2 years of age the absolute numbers and percentage of POS were reduced compared to baseline. In patients with PGS there were more responders (60.6%) compared to patients with POS (48.4%).

Note: Worsening was defined as increase in PGS ADF compared with Baseline.

Note: EP0065 and N01349 participants did not provide appropriate Baseline data and were excluded in the planned analyses.

Data source: N01266 CSR Table 7.4.1

Overall, study participants &lt;2 years of age with POS reported a median (minimum, maximum) absolute worsening in PGS ADF based on EEG from Baseline to Month 3, Month 6, and the end of Evaluation Period of 0.00 ( 1.0, 0.0), each (Table 4-16) (negative data for worsening indicate a reduction of PGS seizure frequency in these analyses). Only 1 participant &lt;2 years of age with POS had data to calculate percent worsening in PGS ADF during the Evaluation Period.

## CHMP comments

Numbers of study participants &lt;2 years of age were very low thus interpretation of the observed efficacy endpoints is difficult.

## Other efficacy variable - Study participants with typical absence seizures

There were 2 study participants with typical absence seizures; neither of these study participants reported non-absence seizures during the course of the study.

## Other efficacy variable - Direct cost parameters

For study participants overall who remained in the study and on BRV treatment, higher proportions of study participants achieved fewer health care provider visits and hospital stays over time, with similar observations across age groups.

## CHMP comments

The 257 patients received BRV treatment in N01266 with a mean of 3.2 study-participants years of exposure. However, only 6 out of 15 patients in ≥ 2 to &lt;4 years age group were exposed for more than 18 months. Thus, even after the completion of the study the information regarding long-term exposure in this age group is very limited.

## Overall summary of TEAEs

An overview of TEAEs by age group is presented for the SS in Table 5 8.

TEAE=treatment-emergent adverse event

Note: TEAEs were defined as AEs that had onset on or after the day of first BRV dose.

Note: n=number of study participants reporting a TEAE for that specific category of AE.

Note: Percentages were relative to the number of study participants in the SS.

Note: Each study participant was counted at most once for each category.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incidences of TEAEs (range: 88.8% to 97.7%), discontinuations due to TEAEs (range: 10.2% to 14.8%), and severe TEAEs (range: 14.8% to 18.6%) were similar across geographic regions. The incidence of SAEs was higher in Western Europe (46.5%) compared with the other geographic regions (range: 27.9% to 32.7%) and the incidence of IMP related TEAEs was lower in Latin America (19.7%) compared with the other geographic regions (range: 32.7% to 37.2%).

The most common TEAEs (ie, those TEAEs experienced by ≥ 10% of all study participants) are presented by age group in Table 5 9.

AE=adverse event; BRV=brivaracetam; MedDRA=Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; PT=preferred term; SOC=system organ class; SS=Safety Set; TEAE=treatment-emergent adverse event

Note: Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as AEs that had onset on or after the day of first BRV dose.

Note: n=number of study participants reporting a TEAE for the specified SOC or PT.

Note: Percentages were relative to the number of study participants in the SS.

Note: Each study participant was counted at most once for each SOC and PT.

Data source: N01266 CSR Table 12.2.1.1

A total of 240 study participants (93.4%) experienced TEAEs, most frequently reported in the system organ class (SOC) of Infections and infestations (187 study participants [72.8%]), followed by Nervous system disorders (135 study participants [52.5%]), and Gastrointestinal disorders (117 study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

participants [45.5%]). Overall, the most frequently reported TEAEs (by preferred term [PT]) were nasopharyngitis (75 study participants [29.2%]), pyrexia (65 study participants [25.3%]), and pharyngitis (59 study participants [23.0%]) (Table 5 9).

In considering most common ongoing TEAEs by 3-month time interval, a higher proportion of study participants experiencing TEAEs was observed during the first 3 months of treatment (195 study participants [75.9%]) compared with the subsequent time intervals, with an overall trend of similar TEAEs over time.

In considering most common TEAEs by total duration of exposure cohorts, across total duration of exposure cohorts, the most frequent TEAEs experienced were consistently nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, vomiting, pharyngitis, seizure, and diarrhea. Study participants who remained on BRV for periods longer than 30 months experienced increased incidence of PTs in the SOC of Infections and infestations (eg, upper respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis, cough, and rhinitis).

## Most common TEAEs by study period

A total of 120 DE study participants entered the Up-Titration Period and 59 DE study participants (49.2%) experienced TEAEs, most frequently in the SOCs of Infections and infestations (22 study participants [18.3%]) and Psychiatric disorders (20 study participants [16.7%]). Overall, the incidence of TEAEs (by PT) was low (&lt;6%) with irritability (7 study participants [5.8%]) and decreased appetite, diarrhea, and cough (6 study participants [5.0%] each) being most frequently reported.

One DE study participant (1/120 study participants [0.8%]) experienced a TEAE of suicidal ideation during the Up Titration Period. Nine study participants (9/255 study participants [3.5%]) experienced TEAEs of suicidal ideation during the Evaluation Period (DE n=7, LTFU n=2). One study participant (DE) (1/124 study participants [0.8%]) experienced a TEAE of suicidal ideation during the Safety Period.

A total of 255 study participants entered the Evaluation Period and a majority experienced TEAEs during this period (233 study participants [91.4% of all study participants]). The most frequently reported TEAEs overall were nasopharyngitis (73 study participants [28.6%]) and pyrexia (61 study participants [23.9%]).

Eighty-six study participants entered the Down-Titration Period, and 9 study participants (10.5%) experienced TEAEs. Varicella, nasopharyngitis, and status epilepticus were reported by 2 study participants (2.3%) each; the remaining PTs were reported by 1 participant each.

One hundred twenty-four study participants were evaluated during the Safety Period and 22 study participants (17.7%) experienced TEAEs. Pharyngitis was reported by 3 study participants (2.4%) and pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, and seizure were reported by 2 participants (1.6%) each; the remaining PTs were reported by 1 participant each.

## Treatment-emergent AEs by maximum intensity

Overall, a majority of study participants experienced TEAEs with a maximum intensity of mild (60 study participants [23.3%]) or moderate (136 study participants [52.9%]). A total of 44 study participants (17.1%) experienced severe TEAEs. The most frequently reported severe TEAEs were seizure (7 study participants [2.7%]), pneumonia (7 study participants [2.7%]), and status epilepticus (5 study participants [1.9%]); no other severe TEAEs were experienced by more than 2 study participants.

Note: Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as AEs that had onset on or after the day of first BRV dose.

Note: n=number of study participants reporting a TEAE for the specified category of AE.

Note: Percentages were relative to the number of study participants in the SS.

Note: An AE was considered to be related to IMP if either the relationship to IMP was specified as related by the Investigator or the relationship to IMP was not specified.

Data source: N01266 CSR Table 12.3.1

## CHMP comments

The most common TEAEs are similar to the ones described in the SmPC. No new unexpected TEAEs were reported.

## Adverse events of special interest

There were no study participants who reported TEAEs of special interest. Three study participants reported 4 TEAEs that were erroneously marked as TEAEs of special interest. These TEAEs did not meet the predefined criteria described in the protocol for being of special interest; however, cases were not resolved by data cleaning before lock of the data base. Therefore, these cases are reported:

- 1 event of seizure (nonserious, mild, did not lead to discontinuation)
- 2 events of simple partial seizures in 1 participant (1 event was nonserious and moderate, 1 event was serious and moderate, and both led to discontinuation)
- 1 event of epididymitis (serious, moderate, did not lead to discontinuation)

## Deaths

Seven study participants died during the study. A by participant listing of AEs with an outcome of death is provided in N01266 CSR Listing 9.2.4 and is presented in Table 5-11.

## CHMP comments

Seven patients died during the study according to the Table 5-11 'AEs with an outcome of death (SS)'. Patients' age ranged from 0.58 to 14 years old. Two patients were directly enrolled (DE) into the study, while remaining were from the LTFU. The relationship to the IMP was considered as not related by the MAH.

It is noted that another fatal outcome was presented in the Table 5-13 'AEs leading to discontinuation (SS)'. Patient (LTFU/F/)  died from pneumonia on day 81 from the treatment onset. Addition of this patient to the list would make the most common cause of death pneumonia (n=4). The second most common cause of death was circulatory collapse (n=2). Other death causes were reported in single individual patients.

Overall, a total of 83 study participants (32.3%) experienced serious TEAEs, most frequently in the SOC of Nervous system disorders (41 study participants [16.0%]) (N01266  CSR Table 12.4.1.1). Seizure was the most frequently reported serious TEAE by PT.

There were a total of 5 SAEs considered to be IMP related: weight decreased, epilepsy, seizure, status epilepticus, and homicidal ideation (each experienced by 1 study participant [0.4%]).

## CHMP comments

Seizures (6.2%) and status epilepticus (4.3%) were the most common serious TEAEs. The highest proportion of patients with 'status epilepticus' were reported in patients ≥ 1 month to &lt;2 years old (5.6%) and ≥ 4 to &lt;12 years old (5%).

'Convulsion' is listed as a common ADR in the SmPC. Status epilepticus is not listed in the SmPC.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Thirty-one study participants (12.1%) had TEAEs that led to permanent discontinuation of IMP (Table 5 8). The most frequently reported TEAEs overall that led to discontinuation of IMP were suicidal ideation (4 study participants) and pneumonia, simple partial seizures, status epilepticus, pregnancy, and circulatory collapse (2 study participants each). Ten of the 31 study participants discontinued due to IMP-related TEAEs.

Majority of patients were from the LTFU (n=20) and 13 patients were DE. Majority of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation resolved or were resolving (n=22). The AEs which were not resolved after discontinuation of treatment included pregnancy (n=2), suicidal ideation (n=2), depression/major depression (n=2), simple partial seizures (n=2), neurocystirecosis and hepatic enzyme increase.

## Hematology

Mean values for the majority of hematology parameters remained within the normal ranges overall and for each age group. Observed changes from Baseline to the Last Value were small and generally similar between age groups.

Overall, the incidences of possibly clinically significant treatment-emergent (PCST) hematology values in the Evaluation Period were generally low ( ≤ 10% for any parameter), with the exception of low neutrophils (46 study participants [18.5%]).

Reported TEAEs associated with hematology values were in the SOCs of Blood and lymphatic system disorders or Investigations and included anemia (5 study participants [1.9%]), hypochromic anemia, neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased, white blood cell count decreased (2 study participants [0.8%] each), and eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, iron deficiency anemia, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, eosinophil count increased, and hemoglobin decreased (1 study participant [0.4%] each).

## Blood chemistry

Mean values for the majority of biochemistry parameters remained within the normal ranges overall and for each age group. Observed changes from Baseline to the Last Value were small and generally similar between age groups. Overall, no consistent or clinically relevant treatment related changes in mean or median chemistry values were observed. With the exception of GGT, the incidences of PCST values for liver function parameters were low. Reported PCST blood chemistry values for liver function included high ALT (9 study participants [3.6%]), high AST (4 study participants [1.6%]), high ALP (4 study participants [1.6%]), and high bilirubin (1 study participant [0.4%]).

## Endocrinology

Mean values for the endocrinology parameters remained within the normal ranges for the duration of the study overall and for each age group. Mean and/or median endocrinology values occasionally were outside the normal range overall and for individual age groups at visits where the number of study participants for that visit was small or where values for the given parameter were already outside the normal range at Baseline. These changes were not deemed to be clinically significant.

## Urinalysis

Urinalysis parameters were generally within normal ranges and there were no mean changes from Baseline to the Last Value during the Evaluation Period and during the Up Titration Period for DE study participants that were considered clinically relevant.

## Vital signs

Mean values for the vital signs parameters remained within the normal ranges overall and for each age group. Observed changes from Baseline to the Last Value were small and generally similar between

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

age groups. Overall, no consistent or clinically relevant treatment related changes in mean or median vital signs values were observed.

## ECG findings

At Baseline, the majority of study participants (194 study participants out of 254 [76.4%]) had normal ECG findings; 58 study participants out of 254 (22.8%) had abnormal but not clinically significant ECG findings; and 2 study participants (0.8%) had clinically significant findings. The percentage of study participants with normal and abnormal but not clinically significant ECG findings remained generally consistent over time through the SV.

## Pregnancies

There were 2 pregnancies reported by UCB's Patient Safety database (N01266 CSR Listing 9.2.2):

- Study participant LTFU study participant at study entry. Investigational medicinal product was discontinued.
- Study participant LTFU study participant at study entry. Investigational medicinal product was discontinued.

## Tanner stage

Apart from slight inconsistencies regarding the staging of the development process in some study participants between individual visits, the individual data are as expected. There is no obvious effect of the drug on the sexual maturation process.

## Behavior and cognition

## Achenbach CBCL

Mean and median changes from Baseline in CBCL raw scores for both the study participants aged 1½ to 5 years and for ages 6 to 18 years were small in amplitude and generally negative (reflecting slight improvement) or close to 0. In both age groups, the vast majority of study participants had no shift in T score category from Baseline to last evaluation for each Achenbach CBCL subscale (between normal and borderline or clinical range [BCR]).

The proportions of study participants aged 1½ to 5 who were normal at Baseline and remained in the normal range at the 6-month assessment were 82.1% for aggressive behavior, 79.5% for anxious/depressed, 51.3% for attention problems, 69.2% for emotionally reactive, 82.1% for sleep problems, 59.0% for somatic complaints, and 46.2% for withdrawn. The proportions of study participants aged 6 to 18 years who were normal at Baseline and remained in the normal range at the 6-month assessment were 55.2% for aggressive behavior, 62.1% for anxious/depressed, 44.0% for attention problems, 69.8% for rule-breaking behavior, 42.2% for social problems, 57.8% for somatic complaints, 59.5% for thought problems, and 60.3% for withdrawn/depressed.

## BRIEF-P/BRIEF

The BRIEF-P was used for study participants ≥ 2 years to &lt;5 years of age and the BRIEF was used for study participants ≥ 5 years of age.

Mean and median changes from Baseline in BRIEF-P and BRIEF raw scores were small in amplitude and generally negative (reflecting slight improvement) or close to 0. In both age groups, the vast majority of study participants had no shift in T score category from Baseline to last evaluation for BRIEFP/BRIEF subscales (between normal and potentially clinically significant [PCS]). Changes that occurred across the BRIEF-P subscales were mostly from PCS to normal. Across the BRIEF subscales, similar proportions of study participants changed from normal to PCS or from PCS to normal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The proportions of study participants aged ≥ 2 years to &lt;5 years of age (BRIEF-P) who were normal at Baseline and remained in the normal range at the 6-month assessment were 80.0% for inhibitory selfcontrol, 77.8% for flexibility, 30.0% for emergent metacognition, and 70.0% for global executive composite (GEC). The proportions of study participants aged ≥ 5 years of age (BRIEF) who were normal at Baseline and remained in the normal range at the 6-month assessment were 48.5% for behavioral regulation, 49.5% for metacognition, and 43.7% for GEC.

## Bayley-III  scores

Only 1 study participant met the criteria of the Bayley-III assessment.

## PedsQL

Mean and median changes from Baseline in parent-reported PedsQL scores were generally positive (reflecting improvement) or close to 0 when negative, with the exception of values at Early Discontinuation, where the mean changes were negative (ranging from -5.1 for school functioning to 2.3 for emotional functioning).

Similarly, for self-reported PedsQL, the mean and median changes from Baseline were generally positive or close to 0 when negative, with the exception of values at Early Discontinuation, where the mean changes for all but 1 score were negative (ranging from -8.2 for physical functioning to 0.2 for social functioning).

Calculated values and change from Baseline in PedsQL scores, by age, parent reported and self reported are provided for the SS in N01266 CSR Table 7.16.2.1 and N01266  CSR Table 7.16.2.2, respectively. No particular trends in calculated values and change from Baseline in PedsQL scores, by age, parent reported and self-reported were observed.

## CHMP comments

No clear changes were observed for sexual maturation, cognitive and behavioral functioning as measured by Tanner scale, Achenbach CBCL, BRIEF-P/BRIEF and PedsQL.

## Assessment of suicidality

Positive findings on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) for questions regarding suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior were reported for 13 study participants and 11 study participants, respectively. Of the study participants who had positive responses on the C SSRS, 11 study participants experienced TEAEs of suicidal ideation, 1 study participant experienced a TEAE of suicide attempt, 4 study participants experienced depression, 1 study participant experienced depressed mood, and 3 study participants experienced self-injurious behavior.

No suicide attempts were reported on the C-SSRS during the study.

## 2.3.2. Discussion on clinical aspects

N01266 was a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BRV in study participants with epilepsy.

The eligible LTFU study participants were enrollment from studies N01263, EP0065, or N01349 (n=137). In addition, a number of eligible patients were directly enrolled (DE) into the study (n=127).

The study objectives primarily focused on long-term safety of treatment. The efficacy variables were described as secondary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total of 264 study participants had been enrolled and 257 received BRV treatment in N01266  with a mean of 3.2 study-participants years of exposure. The largest group of patients included into the study was 4-12 years old (n=141). Only 6 out of 15 patients in ≥2 to &lt;4 years age group were exposed for more than 18 months. Thus, even after the completion of the study the information regarding longterm exposure in this age group is very limited. At baseline, patients had the most common type of POS - complex partial seizures (56%) and the most common type of PGS seizures were myoclonic seizures (30%).

Due to study design the interpretation of the observed efficacy results is highly uncertain. In patients ≥2 years of age the absolute numbers and percentage of POS were reduced compared to baseline. Other efficacy variables for all study participants ≥ 2 years of age - absolute and percent change in 28days adjusted total seizure frequency from Baseline to the end of the Evaluation Period, seizure freedom, proportion of seizure free days during the evaluation period, - are pointing to the same direction as secondary efficacy variables.

Numbers of study participants &lt;2 years of age were very low thus interpretation of the observed efficacy endpoints is difficult.

The most common TEAEs are similar to the ones known for BRV which are described in the SmPC. No new unexpected TEAEs were reported. Seizures (6.2%) and status epilepticus (4.3%) were the most common serious TEAEs. The highest proportion of patients with 'status epilepticus' were reported in patients ≥1 month to &lt;2 years old (5.6%) and ≥4 to &lt;12 years old (5%).

There were some discrepancies observed in reported deaths. Seven patients died during the study according to the Table 5-11 'AEs with an outcome of death (SS)'. Patients' age ranged from 0.58 to 14 years old. Two patients were directly enrolled (DE) into the study, while remaining were from the LTFU. The relationship to the IMP was considered as not related by the MAH. It is noted that another fatal outcome was presented in the Table 5-13 'AEs leading to discontinuation (SS)'. Patient (LTFU/F/8)  died from pneumonia on day 81 from the treatment onset. Addition of this patient to the list would make the most common cause of death pneumonia (n=4). The second most common cause of death was circulatory collapse (n=2). Other death causes were reported in single individual patients.

It is also noted that in the Table 5-13 'AEs leading to discontinuation (SS)' 33 patients discontinued treatment because of AEs, including 8 fatal cases. Majority of patients were from the LTFU (n=20) and 13 patients were DE. Majority of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation resolved or were resolving (n=22). The AEs which were not resolved after discontinuation of treatment included pregnancy (n=2), suicidal ideation (n=2), depression/major depression (n=2), simple partial seizures (n=2), neurocysticercosis and hepatic enzyme increase (n=1 each).

No clear changes/trends were observed for sexual maturation, cognitive and behavioral functioning as measured by Tanner scale, Achenbach CBCL, BRIEF-P/BRIEF and PedsQL.

In summary, no new information regarding efficacy of BRV were reported and the safety findings in N01266 were generally consistent with the known safety profile of BRV.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

No new efficacy or safety concerns were identified in the study N01266. Safety profile of the paediatric patients who received BRV treatment and completed the N01266 study was in line with the established safety profile of BRV. Therefore, the benefit-risk ratio remains unchanged. No changes in the SmPC are considered necessary.
