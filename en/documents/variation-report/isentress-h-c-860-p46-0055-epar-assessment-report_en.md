## I. INTRODUCTION

In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, is submitting the final report for a paediatric clinical study  (Protocol PN248), a Phase II, open-label trial to evaluate the  safety  and  tolerability  of  Isentress  in  HIV-infected  children  2  to  &lt;18  years,  receiving  either  the raltegravir 400 mg film-coated tablet or the chewable tablet formulations.

The  MAH  states  that  in  accordance  with  Article  16(2)  of  Regulation  (EC)  N°  726/2004,  the  data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for Isentress and therefore do not require taking further regulatory action on the marketing authorization for Isentress at this stage.

## II. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1. Introduction

Raltegravir is a HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitor approved in both treatment- experienced and treatment-naïve  adult  patients.  Raltegravir  received  initial  marketing  authorization  in  2007  in  adult treatment-experienced and in July 2009 in treatment-naïve adult patients at a dose of 400 mg BID. Based  on  complete  24  week  and  partial  48  week  data  from  a  Phase  I/II  study  in  HIV-1  infected children  and  adolescents,  IMPAACT  P1066  (Merck  Protocol  022),  raltegravir  received  marketing authorization in the European Union (February 2013) for the treatment of paediatric patients 2 to 18 years  of  age.  An  extension  application  (EMEA/H/C/000860/X/44/G)  submitted  in  June  2013  for granules  for  oral  suspension  in  children  from  4  weeks  to  &lt;  2years  of  age  is  currently  under  EMA review.

## 2. Study P 248

A  Phase  II,  multicenter,  open-label,  non-comparative  study  of  raltegravir  (MK-0518)  in  two  oral formulations  in  combination  with  other  antiretroviral  agents  to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability  and antiretroviral activity in HIV-1 infected Russian children and adolescents.

Data  collected  from  this  single  country  clinical  study  in  a  local  patient  population  was  intended  to supplement the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) data already generated in IMPAACT P1066 in the 2 to 18 year age range.

This trial was conducted in ten (10) centres, of which nine (9) allocated subjects to study treatment.

## Ethical conduct

The  MAH  states  that  'clinical  trials  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  current  standard  research approaches with regard to the design, conduct, and analysis of such trials including the archiving of essential documents. All trials were conducted following appropriate Good Clinical Practice standards and considerations for the ethical treatment of human subjects that were in place at the time the trials were performed.'

## 2.1 Description of the study

Both treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve patients were eligible to participate in this study. Thirty-two (32) HIV-infected paediatric patients, ages 2 years to &lt;18 years of age (at the time of  signing the informed consent) participated in this study. Treatment-experienced patients included patients who were failing or who were intolerant to other licensed ARTs.

Patients weighing &gt; 7kg, with a screening HIV RNA &gt;1,000 copies/mL, were eligible. Patients with ALT, AST or AP &gt; 5x ULN or HCV or HBV co-infection were excluded. The study treatment duration for a given patient was 24 weeks.

Co-  administration  of  phenobarbital,  phenytoin  and  rifampicin  was  prohibited.  Use  of  systemic immunosuppressive therapy or immune modulators within one month prior to treatment in this study was also prohibited

Based on the U.S. Prescribing Information (USPI) at the time Protocol 248 was started, the following dosing recommendation by age group were studied:

- patients 12 to 18 years: 400 mg twice daily (BID) of the film-coated tablet;
- patients 6 to &lt; 12 years: either 400 mg BID of the film-coated tablet (if ≥25 kg) or a weightbased dose of the chewable tablet formulation (maximum of 300 mg) BID;
- patients 2 to &lt;  6 years: a weight based dose of the chewable tablet formulation (maximum of 300 mg) BID.

## · Objectives

Primary Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of raltegravir in two oral formulations (filmcoated tablets, chewable tablets) in combination with other antiretroviral agents in pediatric patients, as assessed by review of accumulated safety data.

Secondary  Objective:  Evaluate  the  antiretroviral  activity  of  raltegravir  in  two  oral  formulations  in combination  with  other  antiretroviral  agents  in  pediatric  patients,  as  measured  by  the  following parameters at Week 24:

- Proportion of patients achieving ≥1 log10 drop from baseline in HIV RNA or HIV RNA &lt;200 copies/mL
- Proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA &lt;40 copies/mL
- Proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA &lt;200 copies/mL
- Change from baseline in CD4 cell counts (cells/mm3)
- Change from baseline in CD4 percent

## · Statistical Methods

All efficacy and safety analyses provided descriptive statistics only; no formal comparisons were made between the groups receiving the different formulations.

Primary analysis: The All-Patients-as-Treated (APaT) population was employed for safety analyses. The APaT population consisted of all enrolled patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.

Secondary analysis: The efficacy analyses were based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population. The FAS population included all patients who took at least one dose of study medication, and had baseline (required for change from baseline endpoints only) and at least one postbaseline evaluation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The proportion of patients with virologic responses (achieving ≥1 log10 drop from baseline in HIV RNA or HIV RNA &lt;200 copies/mL; achieving HIV RNA &lt;40 copies/mL; achieving HIV RNA &lt;200 copies/mL) was summarized for the whole population as well as by formulation group at each time point, with primary interest at Week 24. Point estimate and the associated 95% CI calculated using exact binomial method were provided.

The Observed Failure (OF) approach was used as the primary approach to handle missing HIV RNA values. Under this approach, monotone missing values after premature discontinuations were imputed as failures if the discontinuation was due to lack of efficacy.

Other  missing  values  were  excluded  from  the  analysis.  In  addition  to  the  OF  approach,  sensitivity analysis was performed using the Non-Completer = Failure (NC=F) approach.

The  medical  history  profiles  of  patients  were  consistent  with  those  expected  for  children  with  HIV infection. Most secondary diagnoses were infections and infestations and blood and lymphatic system disorders. The most common (≥10% in all patients) condition reported overall was anemia.

## · Antiretroviral therapy

Raltegravir could have been taken without regard to food. At baseline, the investigator selected the other  ARTs  to  be  used  in  combination  with  raltegravir  based  on  current  treatment  guidelines,  the patient's prior treatment history, the results of the HIV-1 genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing at screening, and prior antiretroviral resistance testing, if available.

The treatment regimen consisted of ARTs approved and licensed for use in adult patients, even if not currently approved for use in paediatric patients. Any changes in background ART while on study were discussed with the Sponsor or designee. Unless the change was specifically permitted, patients whose background ART was changed after initiation of study therapy were considered treatment failures. The following changes to background therapy were permitted during the study:

- Substitution within class or rarely, across class for documented toxicity
- Discontinuation of a background ART
- Formula substitutions

Clinical  adverse  events  related  to  raltegravir  alone  were  reported  in  3  (9.4%)  of  the  32  treated patients  overall.  The  drug-related  clinical  adverse  events  related  to  raltegravir  alone  were  the following: diarrhea, vomiting, and somnambulism.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All  3  clinical  adverse  events  were  experienced  by  patients  in  the  raltegravir  chewable  tablet  group. Patient 1 xperienced vomiting on Day 77 (450 mg total daily dose). The event was assessed by the investigator  as  mild  in  intensity.  It  persisted  for  1  minute  then  resolved.  Patient  2  experienced somnambulism on Day 29 (400 mg total daily dose). The event was assessed by the investigator as mild in intensity. It persisted for 63 days then resolved. Patient 3 experienced diarrhea on Day 3 (300 mg total daily dose). The event was assessed by the investigator as mild in intensity. It persisted for 2 days then resolved.

Clinical adverse events related to raltegravir in combination with background ART were reported in 1 (3.1%) of the 32 treated patients overall.

The  drug-related  clinical  adverse  events  related  to  raltegravir  in  combination  with  background  ART were the following: abdominal pain and nausea. The patient who experienced the 2 clinical adverse events was in the raltegravir chewable tablet group. Patient 4 experienced abdominal pain and nausea on Day 1 (300 mg total daily dose). The events were assessed by the investigator as mild in intensity. They persisted for 6 days then resolved.

There were no patients in either formulation group who experienced laboratory adverse events that were related to raltegravir alone. Laboratory adverse events related to raltegravir in combination with background ART were reported in 1 (3.1%) of the 32 treated patients overall.

The  patient  who  experienced  the  laboratory  adverse  event  was  in  the  raltegravir  chewable  tablet group. Patient 4 experienced a decrease in platelet count on Day 85 (150 mg total daily dose). The event was assessed by the investigator as mild in intensity. It persisted for 84 days then resolved.

## 2.2.4 Efficacy results (Secondary analysis)

At Week 24, 86.2% of patients overall achieved ≥1 log10 drop from baseline in HIV RNA or HIV RNA &lt;200 copies/mL. At Week 24, the proportion of patients overall with HIV RNA at &lt;40 copies/mL and &lt;200 copies/mL were 44.8% and 72.4%, respectively. The mean change from baseline in CD4 cell count and percent were 266.7 cells/mm3 and 5.7%, respectively.

Efficacy analyses were all based on the Observed Failure approach.

Plasma HIV RNA and CD4 count were performed at each clinic visit. Plasma HIV RNA determination was performed at each visit, by a central laboratory specified by the Sponsor or designee, using the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay, which has a linear range of 40 to 10,000,000 copies/mL.

Blood samples for genotypic viral resistance testing were collected at the Screening visit and at Week 24 or the 14-Day post-therapy follow-up (if not already obtained at the Week 24 visit) or at an Early discontinuation visit (if applicable) and were tested in patients identified as confirmed virologic failures.

## Viral resistance

Definition of virologic failure for the efficacy analyses:

- 1) Non-responder: patients who never achieved ≥1 log10 drop from baseline in plasma HIV RNA or HIV RNA &lt;200 copies/mL through Week 24

OR

- 2) Virologic rebound at Week 24, defined as:
- a) Confirmed HIV RNA ≥200 copies/mL (on 2 consecutive measurements at least 1 week apart) after initial response with HIV RNA &lt;200 copies/mL or
- b) Confirmed &gt;1.0 log10 increase in HIV RNA above nadir level (on 2 consecutive measurements at least 1 week apart).

Of  the  4  viral  failure  patients,  3  had  post-baseline  genotypic  data  available.  (Testing  on  the  4th patient's sample could not be performed). Overall in the 3 patients with post-baseline genotype data, viruses  from  1  patient  displayed  a  signature  resistance  mutation  (at  AA  155),  along  with  L74I.  The other 2 patients had no signature mutations at AA 143, 148, or 155 (1 patient had another known RAL resistance mutation [L74I, which by itself does not confer resistance to raltegravir, and 1 patient had no other known RAL resistance mutations).

## MAH's discussion and conclusion

The general patterns of safety, tolerability, and efficacy were comparable to the results found in the IMPAACT  P1066  study,  a  Phase  1/2  multicenter,  open-label,  noncomparative  study  of  HIV-infected children and adolescents ≥2 to &lt;19 years of age to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy  of  raltegravir  (film-coated  tablet  and  chewable  tablet  formulations)  in  this  HIV-infected age population. In the IMPAACT P1066 study, there were also no deaths or discontinuations due to an adverse event. Of the 96 final dose patients, 87.5% experienced clinical adverse events (including 14 serious adverse events and 1 serious drug-related adverse event) and 88.5% experienced laboratory adverse events (including 1 serious adverse event and no serious drug-related adverse events). The higher frequency of clinical and laboratory adverse events (including serious adverse events) may be due to the greater number of treatment experienced patients with more advanced HIV disease in the IMPAACT P1066 study. As mentioned, there was only 1 serious drug-related adverse event overall.

The efficacy data (likewise based on the OF approach) at Week 24 in the IMPAACT P1066 study was also  very  similar  to  that  of  the  P248  study.  At  Week  24,  overall  patient  data  demonstrated  71.6% achieved  ≥1  log10  drop  from  baseline  in  HIV  RNA  or  HIV  RNA  &lt;400  copies/mL.  At  Week  24,  the proportion of patients overall with HIV RNA at &lt;50 copies/mL and &lt;400 copies/mL were 53.7% and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

66.3%,  respectively.  Immunologic  benefit  was  also  demonstrated  at  Week  24  for  all  patients:  the mean  change  from  baseline  in  CD4  cell  counts  and  CD4  percent  were  119  cells/mm3  and  3.8%, respectively. The P248 study had more stringent efficacy endpoints and had higher overall percentages of patients achieving those endpoints as compared with the IMPAACT P1066 study. Again, this may be due to sample size and demographic differences.

Data from P248 based on the OF approach demonstrated that raltegravir in combination with other ARTs has acceptable efficacy at Week 24 in the Russian paediatric population, as measured by key efficacy parameters. There were 3 additional supportive endpoints recorded in this study at Week 24 (≥1 log10 drop or &lt;400 copies/mL; &lt;50 copies/mL; &lt;400 copies/mL), and the results for these were generally consistent with the corresponding primary endpoints.

Immunologic benefit was also demonstrated at Week 24 for all patients, based on the OF approach: the mean change from baseline in CD4 cell counts and CD4 percent were 266.7 cells/mm3 and 5.7%, respectively.  The  results  of  analyses  for  patients  overall  using  the  NC=F  approach  were  generally comparable to the results using the OF approach.

In Russian HIV-infected children and adolescents ≥2 to &lt;18 years of age, raltegravir administered as either  the  adult  film-coated  tablet  formulation  or  the  pediatric  chewable  tablet  formulation,  in combination with an optimized background antiretroviral regimen, through 24 weeks,

• was generally safe and well tolerated as chronic therapy at the recommended dose,

· had a favorable antiretroviral effect as measured by the proportions of patients who achieved prespecified virologic responses,

· and demonstrated immunological benefit as measured by changes from baseline in CD4 cell count and CD4 percent.

The MAH states that efficacy and safety data collected from Protocol 248, which evaluated raltegravir use in pediatric patients 2 to &lt;18 years of age in Russia, are consistent with data collected in the pediatric study IMPAACT P1066, thereby continuing to support the conclusion that there is a favourable benefit/risk ratio with administration of raltegravir at the appropriate recommended dose in HIV infected paediatric patients in this age group.

## CHMP's comment

In this study, children were dosed according to the US prescribing information. EU prescribing information differs from the US posology insofar as Isentress is not approved in the EU for children weighing less than 12kg and children weighing 12- &lt;14kg receive a dose of 75mg bd. Difference in dosing and possibly exposure would hence be expected for children weighing 10- 12kg. The report does not allow verifying if any children from this weight bracket were included in the study.

The majority of patients (&gt;80%) were treatment naive. Most presented with a VL &lt;100,000c/ml and a CD 4 count &gt; 500 cells/mm 3 . Twenty- eight of the 32 subjects received the chewable tablet, only four the film coated tablet.

The information on concomitant ART is limited. The most commonly used NRTIs were lamivudine, zidovudine, and abacavir. Only two patients received an NNRTI (efavirenz), and 3 (?4) received a PI. Study duration was 24 weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No PK data were collected. No firm conclusions can be drawn from the efficacy results of this small study, which were reportedly in line with previous paediatric results. The evaluation of safety did not produce any unexpected results. Overall 12.5% of patients experienced drug related AEs. The study was not designed to compare formulations.

## III. CHMP'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

The  MAH  submitted  the  final  report  for  P248,  a  Phase  II,  multicenter,  open-label,  non-comparative study of raltegravir (MK-0518) in two oral formulations in combination with other antiretroviral agents to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability  and  antiretroviral  activity  in  HIV-1  infected  Russian  children  and adolescents.

A chewable tablet and weight- based dose is already approved for children weighing 12kg or more in the EU. An application for granules for oral suspension in children from 4 weeks to &lt; 2years of age is currently under EMA review. The doses used in this trial are largely in line with the EU prescribing information.

The additional information obtained from this study is limited. The MAH does not consider that the study results require changes to the product information to be made. The CHMP agrees.
