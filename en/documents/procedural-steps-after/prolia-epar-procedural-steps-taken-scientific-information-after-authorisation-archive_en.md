The mean lumbar spine BMD T-score at the end of the study was -1.3 in patients treated for 10 years. Fracture incidence was evaluated as a safety endpoint but efficacy in fracture prevention cannot be estimated due to high number of discontinuations and open-label design. The cumulative incidence of new vertebral and non-vertebral fractures were approximately 6.8% and 13.1% respectively, in patients who remained on denosumab treatment for 10 years (n = 1,278). Patients who did not complete the study of any reason had higher on-treatment fracture rates. Incidence of ONJ was 0.04% at 3 years, 0.06% at 5 years |

The risk of ONJ increased with duration of exposure to Prolia. Overall, long-term antiresorptive treatment (including both denosumab and bisphosphonates) may contribute to an increased risk for adverse outcomes such as osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures due to significant suppression of bone remodelling. The optimal total duration of antiresorptive treatment treatment for osteoporosis (including both denosumab and bisphosphonates) has not been established. The need for continued treatment should be re-evaluated periodically based on the benefits and potential risks of denosumab on an individual patient basis, particularly after 5 or more years of use.   |

| II/0055   | Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC based on the final dataset from study 20060289 (treatment for up to 10 years with denosumab in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO)) in fulfilment of the post-authorisation measures MEA 015 and MEA 010. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to combine the SmPC for Prolia 60 mg solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe and Prolia 60 mg solution for injection in line with the latest QRD template. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 26/05/2016   | 02/05/2017   | SmPC   | A total of 2,626 subjects (58% of the women included in the extension study i.e. 34% of the women included in the pivotal study) completed the extension study. In patients treated with Prolia for up to 10 years, BMD increased from the pivotal study baseline by 21.7% at the lumbar spine, 9.2% at the total hip, 9.0% at the femoral neck, 13.0% at the trochanter and 2.8% at the distal 1/3 radius. Fracture incidence was evaluated as a safety endpoint. In years 4 through 10, the rates of new vertebral and non-vertebral fractures did not increase over time; annualised rates were approximately 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Two adjudicated cases of atypical fractures of the femur occurred during the extension study. ONJ has been reported rarely, in 16 patients, in clinical trials in osteoporosis and in breast or prostate cancer patients receiving hormone ablation including a total of 23,148 patients. Thirteen of these ONJ cases occurred in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis during the phase III clinical trial extension following treatment with Prolia for up to 10 years (0.3%; < 0.1 events per 100 subject- years). Fifty nine women participated in the bone biopsy sub-study at month 24 (n = 41) and/or month 84 (n = 22) of the extension study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Bone histology was also evaluated in 17 men with osteoporosis following 1 year treatment with Prolia. Bone biopsy results showed bone of normal architecture and quality with no evidence of mineralisation defects, woven bone or marrow fibrosis. Histomorphometry findings   |

Given that there were several ongoing safety concerns associated with denosumab (Prolia) at the time of this renewal, it was recommended that one additional five-year renewal is asked for on the basis of pharmacovigilance grounds. |

While on treatment, patients with risk factors should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on Prolia therapy, doctors should develop a management plan for the individual patient in close collaboration with a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary interruption of treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk factors are mitigated, where possible.   |

|         | of postmenopausal osteoporosis (Study 20060289). C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   |            |            |             | extension study demonstrated that: - BMD increased at lumbar spine, proximal femur, and radius, in both the long-term and crossover groups. - New vertebral and nonvertebral fracture incidence rates were similar in the long term and crossover groups. - Through year 5 of the extension study, bone turnover markers remain reduced in both the long term and crossover groups with a characteristic attenuation at the end of the dosing interval. - The rates of common adverse events or serious adverse events observed through Month 60 have not shown significant increases over time. - Eight events of ONJ and two atypical femoral fractures have been observed. The median time to onset of ONJ was approximately 5 years after the start of denosumab treatment. One case of atypical femoral fracture was reported after 3 years of denosumab treatment and the other case was reported after 7 years of denosumab treatment. Owing to the small number of subjects, no definite conclusion can be drawn on the ONJ rate over time. A longer duration of treatment with Prolia may increase the risk of these adverse events as it does for Xgeva and other antiresorptive treatments. - Bone biopsies at month 24 of the extension study showed bone of normal architecture and quality with no evidence of mineralization defects, woven bone, or marrow fibrosis.   |

Following this recalculation the ADR frequency categories remained the same, with the following exceptions: 'pain in extremity' changed from common to very common and 'eczema' changed from uncommon to common. The results from the pooled analysis regarding 'influenza- like illness' in section 4.8 of the SmPC were updated from event rates (0.006 per subject year for denosumab and 0.003 per subject year for placebo) to subject incidence rates (1.2% for denosumab and 0.7% for placebo). The revised stratified analysis did not identify an imbalance in influenza-like illness. Although the difference is not statistically significant, there was a 2.2% imbalance in Study 20010223 (denosumab: 41 of 314 subjects, placebo: 5 of 46 subjects) using subject incidence. No imbalances were observed in other studies and the numerical imbalances were not directionally consistent across individual studies.

Atypical femoral fractures are subtrochanteric or proximal diaphyseal fractures that occur with little to no trauma. Specific radiographic findings, including a simple transverse or oblique fracture with beaking of the cortex and diffuse cortical thickening of the proximal femoral shaft, characterize these events. They may occur bilaterally. An increased risk of atypical femoral fractures has been reported with bisphosphonates, another class of |

As a result, the MAH has evaluated the potential for atypical femoral fractures in patients treated with Prolia in clinical trials and the post-marketing setting. Cases of atypical femoral fracture have been confirmed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Prolia participating in the ongoing open-label extension study of the pivotal phase 3 fracture trial in postmenopausal osteoporosis (FREEDOM). These events have occurred rarely (≥ 1/10,000 t o < 1/1,000) based on 8,928 subjects being exposed to Prolia in bone loss studies, corresponding to 31,266 subject-years of exposure. The new information in the SmPC and Package Leaflet informs prescribers of the risk of atypical femoral fracture with Prolia, provides information on the nature of these events, and guides physicians in the recognition and management of this risk. Further, a DHPC has also been agreed as an additional risk minimisation measure in order to inform prescribers of this safety concern and the subsequent changes to the SmPC. During Prolia (denosumab) treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Patients presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femoral fracture. The contralateral femur should be examined in denosumab- treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Discontinuation of denosumab therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered while they are evaluated. An individual   |

The Prolia SmPC also includes a contraindication for hypocalcemia and steps to mitigate the risk. A review of post-marketing, spontaneous adverse event reports has identified 8 cases of medically confirmed hypocalcemia with severe signs or symptoms, for which a causal association with denosumab could not be ruled out. The majority of these events occurred in patients with severe or end-stage kidney disease who were predisposed to hypocalcemia. The Prolia SmPC currently indicates an increased risk of hypocalcemia in patients with kidney disease and recommends monitoring of calcium levels in patients predisposed to hypocalcemia; adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is recommended in all patients. The SmPC also indicates that, for all patients, hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy with denosumab. To inform prescribers about the post-marketing experience with Prolia, the SmPC has been updated to report that severe symptomatic hypocalcemia has been observed in |

Further, the MAH has made minor editorial changes to the SmPC. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 15/03/2012   | 20/04/2012 | SmPC | Update of SmPC section 5.1 to reflect 2-year clinical data available from study 20060289. Study 20060289 was an open-label Extension Study in the Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis. A total of 4550 patients (2343 Prolia & 2207 placebo) who missed no more than one dose of investigational product in the pivotal study (already described in section 5.1 of the SmPC) and completed all study visits agreed to enroll in a 7-year, multinational, multicenter, open label, single-arm extension study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of Prolia. At month 24 of the extension study, after 5 years of denosumab treatment, the long-term group increased BMD by 13.8% at the lumbar spine, 7.0% at the total hip, 6.2% at the femoral neck and 9.7% at the trochanter from the original pivotal study baseline. Fracture incidence was evaluated as a safety endpoint: continued Prolia treatment maintained a low incidence of new vertebral and non- vertebral fractures in years 4 and 5 (annualized rate of new vertebral fracture was 1.4% in both years 4 and 5, while 1.4% and 1.1% of patients had a non-vertebral fracture in years 4 and 5 respectively). Three cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) occurred during the first 25 months in the study, two cases in the de novo treatment group and one case in the long term treatment group, all cases resolved. |

| II/0011 | This type II variation concerned an update of section 4.8 of the SmPC with information regarding 'hypersensitivity reactions' reported during the post- authorisation phase, a change of the frequency category allocated to the ADR 'hypocalcaemia' from 'very rare' to 'rare', the inclusion of 'osteonecrosis of the jaw' as a rare adverse reaction in the ADR table and the inclusion of text under 'summary of safety profile' in line with the SmPC guideline. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Further, for increased clarity the MAH has implemented changes to the 'instructions for injecting with the Prolia pre- filled syringe with an automatic needle guard' section of the Package Leaflet. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial changes in the annexes, to update the annexes in line with the latest QRD template (version 8.0) and to update the contact details in the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 16/02/2012 | 15/03/2012 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | The MAH has presented reports of 'hypersensitivity' in 6 patients receiving denosumab (60 mg every 6 months) for bone loss. These medically confirmed cases had sufficient information available for review, were not obviously confounded by history or suspect concomitant medication, and although clinical features were variable, drug-related hypersensitivity could not be excluded. Common clinical features among these 6 cases were rash, urticaria, facial oedema, and erythema. None of these cases was fatal and there were no cases featuring bronchospasm or hypotension. The MAH provided data supporting the use of 'Rare' as the appropriate CIOMS frequency category for this ADR. Based on the data from study 20060289 (24 month analysis), an extension study from study 20030216, there were in total 3 cases of ONJ, two cases in the de novo treatment group and one case in the long term treatment group. The MAH provided data supporting the use of 'Rare' as the appropriate CIOMS frequency category for this ADR. |

In this study, foetal lymph nodes were not examined. In another study of cynomolgus monkeys dosed with denosumab throughout pregnancy at AUC exposures 119- fold higher than the human dose (60 mg every 6 months), there were increased stillbirths and postnatal mortality; abnormal bone growth resulting in reduced bone strength, reduced haematopoiesis, and tooth malalignment; absence of peripheral lymph nodes; and decreased neonatal growth. A no observed adverse effect level for reproductive effects was not established. Following a 6 month period after birth, bone related changes showed recovery and there was no effect on tooth eruption. However, the effects on lymph nodes and tooth malalignment persisted, and minimal to moderate mineralisation in multiple tissues was seen in one animal (relation to treatment uncertain). There was no evidence of maternal harm prior to labour; adverse maternal effects occurred infrequently during labour. Maternal mammary gland development was normal. From a clinical viewpoint, women who become pregnant during Prolia treatment are encouraged to enrol in the MAH's Pregnancy Surveillance programme. Contact details are provided in section 6 of the Package Leaflet - Information for the user. Similarly, women who are nursing during Prolia treatment are encouraged to enrol in the MAH's Lactation Surveillance Program.
