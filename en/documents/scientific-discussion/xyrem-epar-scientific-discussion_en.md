## 1 Quality aspects

## 1.1 Introduction

Sodium oxybate is a simple molecule, the sodium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and is presented in the form of a stabilised oral solution, 500mg/ml

## 1.2 Active Substance

Sodium oxybate is the Common Name of the substance butanoic acid 4-hydroxy-monosodium salt. At the time of writing this report there is no INN for this substance.

## 1.2.1 Manufacture

The  manufacturing  process  is  very  simple  and  is  basically  a  one-step  hydrolysis  of  gamma butyrolactone under alkaline conditions with sodium hydroxide.

Starting materials and critical steps are well defined; there are no intermediates.

The active substance is obtained as a white solid which is dried, 'de-lumped' and packed.

The characterisation of the substance arising from the documented method of synthesis confirms that it is  indeed  sodium  oxybate  and  this  has  been  done  by  the  usual  range  of  spectroscopic  methods including UV, IR &amp; NMR together with elemental analysis and pKa determination.

Since sodium oxybate is to be given in solution, polymorphism has not been investigated

## 1.2.2 Specification

The  specification  includes  test  for  identification  (IR,  HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  related  impurities (HPLC)  together  with  tests  for  water  content  (KF)  residual  solvents  (GC)  and  heavy  metals,  all performed by validated methods. It is not necessary to control solid state properties.

The impurities include a number of named impurities and one un-named impurity, the levels of which have all been qualified on a toxicological basis and are considered to present no unnecessary risk.

Batch analyses (n = 45) from the site of manufacture defined in the dossier, demonstrate satisfactory compliance with the agreed specification and indicate good uniformity.

## 1.2.3 Stability

In addition to forced degradation studies in the solid state and in solution, stability studies have been performed  on  6  batches  of  sodium  oxybate  under  ICH  conditions,  accelerated  and  long  term.  No significant  negative  trends  or  out  of  specification  results  were  observed  in  the  formal  ICH  stability investigation, and on the basis of the accumulated results a satisfactory re-test period has been defined.

## 1.3 Medicinal Product

## 1.3.1 Pharmaceutical Development

The product is a simple aqueous solution which is stabilised with malic acid (hydroxysuccinic acid) and adjusted to the pH of maximum stability. From a microbiological point of view, investigations on this formulation showed that the product also had intrinsic antimicrobial activity and passed the test for  efficacy  of  antimicrobial  preservatives;  therefore  it  was  considered  unnecessary  to  include  a preservative in the formulation.

The product is presented as a plastic PET bottle with a child-resistant screw cap closure for the liquid, and in order to facilitate accurate dosage a separate dispensing or dosing system is attached at time of first use. This consists of a plastic adaptor to fit into the bottle, leading to a syringe dispenser allowing the patient to withdraw the accurate dose. In addition, two plastic dosing cups are provided with childresistant closures.

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1.3.2 Manufacture of the Product

The active substance is dissolved in purified water and the pH adjusted with malic acid before dilution with purified water, filtration, and bottling. The  validation of this simple  scheme  was  not problematical.

## 1.3.3 Product Specification

The product release specification includes relevant tests and limits for physical examination, identity

(HPLC  &amp;  IR),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (degradation  products,  HPLC),  volume  in  container, reproducibility of dosage, pH,  microbiological attributes (PhEur), etc. Control  of rheological properties is not considered necessary for a mobile liquid dosage form.

Batch analyses (n = 18) indicate satisfactory compliance with the agreed specification and satisfactory product uniformity

## 1.3.4 Stability of the Product

In all,  ten  batches  of  product  have been investigated for stability under ICH conditions, accelerated and long term, and in all cases the results support the shelflife and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.

In  addition,  since  this  is  a  multidose  product  with  a  special  adapter  and  dosing  system,  additional studies were performed with these plastic components in place, in order to mimic the in-use situation, and a suitable in-use shelflife has been defined.

In general the studies show that the plastic adapter and dosing system is compatible with the solution and does not encourage degradation.

Apart  from  the  physical  chemical  analytical  studies  carried  out  during  the  stability  investigations, microbiological studies were also performed with satisfactory results.

## 1.4 Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The  simple  synthesis  and  manufacture  of  the  product  are  described  and  controlled  in  a  relevant manner,  and  the  specifications  of  the  active  substance  and  medicinal  product  are  considered  to  be relevant for a product of this type. The stability of the product has been well-investigated, both in the unopened form, and with the adaptor and dosing system in place during use.

Satisfactory uniformity of dose has been demonstrated, and there are no unresolved quality issues that could have an impact on the benefit/risk balance for the patient.

## 2 Non-clinical aspects

## 2.1 Introduction

## 2.2 Pharmacology

## 2.2.1 Primary pharmacodynamics (in vitro/in vivo)

Oxybate (GHB)  is a metabolite of γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA)  which  is  synthesised  and accumulated  by  neurones  in  the  brain.  It  is  present  at µ M  concentrations  in  all  brain  regions investigated  as  well  as  in  several  peripheral  organs,  particularly  in  the  gastro-intestinal  system. Neuronal  depolarisation  releases  GHB  into  the  extracellular  space  in  a  Ca2+-dependent  manner.  A family of GHB receptors in rat brain have been identified and cloned and most probably belong to the G-protein-coupled  receptors.  High-affinity  receptors  for  GHB  are  present  only  in  neurones,  with  a restricted specific distribution in the hippocampus, cortex and dopaminergic structures of rat brain.

In  general,  stimulation  of  these  receptors  with  low  (physiological)  amounts  of  GHB  induces hyperpolarisation in dopaminergic structures with a reduction of dopamine release. However, in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, GHB seems to induce depolarisation with an accumulation of cGMP and  an  increase  in  inositol  phosphate  turnover.  However,  at  higher  (therapeutic)  exposures,  GHB

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

receptors are saturated and probably de-sensitised and down-regulated. Such GHBergic potentiations induce  dopaminergic  hyperactivity,  strong  sedation  with  anaesthesia  and  EEG  changes  that  are consistent with normal sleep and/or epileptic spikes.

The  pathogenesis  of  narcolepsy  is  still  unknown,  but  an  imbalance  between  monoamines  and acetylcholine is generally accepted. Recent research has found a marked reduction of the neuropeptide hypocretin type 1 in the cerebrospinal fluid of a majority of patients and a global loss of hypocretins in post-mortem brain tissue of narcoleptic subjects. The hypocretins are synthesised by a small group of neurones predominantly located in the lateral hypothalamic and perifornical regions of the hypothalamus.  The  hypothalamic  system  directly  and  strongly  innervates  and  potently  excites noradrenergic,  dopaminergic,  serotoninergic,  histaminergic  and  cholinergic  neurones.  The  effect  of GHB on this system has not been investigated. However, the available data indicate that its mode of action is likely to relate to non-specific dopaminergic stimulation rather than the hypocretin system.

Formal nonclinical pharmacology studies to investigate the primary pharmacodynamics have not been conducted  by  the  applicant,  rather  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  scientific  literature  has  been conducted.  The  publications  included  have  been  selected  based  on  their  relevance  to  the  proposed indications, based on evidence of efficacy from early clinical studies. In addition, animal models of cataplexy and narcolepsy are continuing to be developed, but have not yet been fully validated. Little nonclinical information is available on its effects on narcolepsy in general, and cataplexy in particular. Available,  directly  relevant  data,  from  the  published  literature,  has  been  reviewed  but  the  current understanding  of  the  role  of  GHB  in  the  CNS  does  not  provide  a  mechanistic  explanation  of  the positive  clinical  effects  reported  in  the  dossier.  GHB  had  no  effect  on  cataplexy  in  dogs  with hereditary narcolepsy when administered as a single dose of 500 mg/kg i.v. or 50 mg/kg/day p.o. for 3 consecutive days. However, although such dogs have a mutation of the type 2 hypocretin receptor, the clinical relevance of this model remains to be established. Moreover, a dose of 75 mg/kg/day for at least 14 days is required for efficacy in humans.

Though the precise mode of action is unknown, the sedative properties of GHB and its effects on sleep may play a role in the efficacy observed in humans.

Evidence  from  a  human  clinical  study  (Study  OMC-SXB-20)  where  GHB  was  administered  to narcoleptic patients and overnight polysomnograms (PSG) were recorded, suggests that GHB modifies sleep  architecture,  specifically  a  dose-related  increase  in  Stage  3  &amp;  4  slow  wave  sleep  (SWS,  delta sleep). The cause of human narcolepsy and cataplexy is, as yet, unknown. Recent evidence points to the  loss  of  hypocretin-containing  neurones,  possibly  due  to  autoimmune  attack,  as  a  likely  cause (Scammell  2003).  Hypocretin  is  a  neurotransmitter  that  has  roles  amongst  others,  in  sleep-wake regulation.  Alterations  in  hypocretin  neurotransmission  have  also  been  observed  in  mouse  and  dog models of narcolepsy, although no studies have been undertaken with GHB in these models. Animal models of cataplexy and narcolepsy are continuing to be developed (Gerashchenko et al, 2003), but the effects of GHB in these models, have yet to be investigated.

## 2.2.2 Secondary pharmacodynamics

Published  literature  reports  are  presented  that  discuss  the  potential  for  effects  on  the  respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal and endocrine function, together with relevant findings from the toxicology studies.

GHB may increase growth hormone secretion, but this effect is inconsistent across species and dose levels. GHB has no other relevant secondary pharmacodynamic effects in animals.

GHB  consistently  decreases  respiration  by  effects  on  minute  volume  and  respiratory  rate,  with younger animals being more susceptible to these effects. In halothane-anaesthetized rats, GHB (187.5750  mg/kg  i.p.)  dose-dependently  decreased  basal  minute  volume  and  respiratory  rate  compared  to pre-injection  control,  with  a  maximum  decrease  to  about  60%  of  pre-injection  values  for  each parameter at the highest dose of GHB (Hedner et al , 1980).

Effects on cardiovascular parameters were also studied as part of the repeat dose toxicology studies in dogs,  including  heart  rhythm  and  P-QRS-T  complexes  determined  from  ECGs,  and  there  was  no evidence of any dramatic changes in these parameters during the studies at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day (corresponding to male and female AUC0-24 of 3363.05 and 3631.35 µg·hr/mL and Cmax of 583.0

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and 726.7 µg/mL). Additionally, in several human clinical studies, there were no significant effects of GHB administration on ECGs. The applicant claims that given the relatively long established clinical use  of  GHB,  as  an  anaesthetic  and  sedative  and  other  uses  such  as  for  the  treatment  of  alcohol withdrawal,  the  undesirable  effects  and  risk  potential  of  GHB  are  well  known,  and  additional nonclinical  safety  pharmacology  studies  are  not  justified.  Results  of  some  studies  indicate  weak rewarding  effects  and  possible  development  of  tolerance  in  rats  and  mice,  however  there  is  no compelling evidence that GHB represents a significant drug dependence hazard. Interaction of GHB with ethanol and other central nervous system depressants generally result in greater central depressant effects than seen with either drug alone. Numerous case reports of GHB poisoning demonstrate that overdosing in humans is associated with many of the same signs and symptoms as in animals: a rapid onset  of  drowsiness,  nausea,  vomiting,  myoclonic  seizures,  respiratory  depression  progressing  to apnoea, and coma.

## 2.2.3 Safety pharmacology

The  applicant  has  not  conducted  animal  safety  pharmacology  studies.  However,  there  is  ample evidence in the published literature that GHB is a potent CNS depressant, may cause convulsions and potentially fatal respiratory depression and cardiac failure.

On  the  basis  of  available  information,  the  lack  of  conventional  safety  pharmacology  studies  is considered acceptable. However, since co-medication is probable, the effects of GHB on respiratory pattern  in  the  presence  of  other  CNS  depressing  agents  like  ethanol,  and  inhibitors  of  GHB metabolism like valproic acid and ethosuximide are mentioned in the SPC. A  weak  tolerance  to  GHB  administration  has  been  demonstrated  in  a  number  of  specific  animal behavioural studies and also the development of cross-tolerance between GHB and ethanol. Therefore, potentially,  an  acute  toxic  effect  (e.g.  acute  respiratory  depression)  could  be  experienced  after  drug intake following a period of drug withdrawal, sufficient for the disappearance of tolerance. Caution is advised  if  treatment  is  re-started  after  discontinuation.  (SPC,  section  4.2).  Clinical  data  (open  label study  OMC-GHB-3)  have  failed  to  show  any  major  development  of  tolerance  on  efficacy  and  the AUC after 8-weeks compared to the first dose was not significantly increased (study OMC-SXB-10, see  clinical  section).  However,  as  these  clinical  data  are  too  limited  to  draw  firm  conclusions,  the potential  for  development  of  tolerance,  especially  with  concomitant  intake  of  ethanol,  cannot  be excluded and is mentioned in the SPC.

## 2.2.4 Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Formal  studies  of  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  have  not  been  conducted.  According  to  the published literature, concomitant administration of GHB and other CNS depressants (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, alcohol) results in an additive increase in sedation.

## 2.3 Pharmacokinetics

The  applicant  has  not  conducted  animal  PK  studies,  with  the  justification  that  the  more  relevant pharmacokinetic data are derived from human exposure. Some data have been compiled from a review of  the  published  literature.  Data  on  non-clinical  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  and  excretion have been compiled from a review of the published literature

## 2.3.1 Absorption- Bioavailability

In the rat, oral bioavailability was about 50-80%. Kinetics was non-linear, with oral dose increments resulting in an under-proportional increase in Cmax and an over-proportional increase in the AUC. By contrast, i.v. administration resulted in an over-proportional increase in Cmax. Thus, both absorption from the gut and elimination may depend on saturable mechanisms. Saturable absorption from the gut was confirmed in an everted rat intestine model.

## 2.3.2 Distribution

Whole-body autoradiography following  i.v.  injection  of 14 C-GHB in mice showed a fairly uniform distribution pattern of radioactivity due to GHB and/or its metabolites.  Shortly after injection, lower radioactivity was found in fatty tissues such as thymus, brown fat, and the white and grey brain matter

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

than  in  other  tissues,  including  plasma.    However,  by  30  minutes  after  injection,  radioactivity  was distributed throughout the body, including brain, skeletal muscle, myocardium, kidney, spleen, liver, lung, thymus, urinary bladder, stomach, intestines, and, in pregnant mice, the foetus. GHB distributed rapidly  to  the  brain  of  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys,  producing  brain  concentrations  several  orders  of magnitude above the physiological level. In the dog, the highest concentration was found in the white matter of the temporal lobe. There are no data on plasma protein binding in animals, but this is likely to be negligible.

## 2.3.3 Metabolism (in vitro/in vivo)

Metabolism of GHB is rapid and complete and proceeds via succinic semialdehyde, succinate and the Krebs cycle or through γ -hydroxybutyrate and β -oxidation.

The potential for inhibition of CYP isozymes was tested in pooled human liver microsome fractions using standard markers for CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A. In all cases, the IC50 was &gt; 3000 µ M (&gt; 378 µ g/ml). Since the average maximum human exposure is 142 µ g/ml, GHB is not expected to show  pharmacokinetic  interactions  with  drugs  metabolised  by  these  isozymes.  Non  P450  mediated effects on GHB metabolism are unclear.

A rat study found that co-administration of compounds stimulating or inhibiting GHB dehydrogenase were able to decrease or increase plasma levels of GHB by up to 1/3. The interactions resulting from the stimulation or inhibition of GHB dehydrogenase, namely with anticonvulsivant drugs and L-dopa are considered to be clinically relevant and are mentioned in the SPC.

## 2.3.4 Excretion

Clearance is predominantly by biotransformation, with limited amounts of unchanged drug recovered from  the  urine  or  faeces.  Radiospirometric  studies  in  rats  showed  that  14C-GHB  was  rapidly converted to exhaled CO2 and about 2/3 of the dose was excreted by respiration within 6 hours and an additional  10-  20%  over  the  next  18  hours.  After  oral  administration  of  14C-labelled  GHB (200 mg/kg) to rats, the urinary recovery over 48 hours was 5.5% of the radioactive dose, and only 1.5% was recovered in the faeces. There are no data on the excretion of GHB in the milk of lactating animals. The proposed SPC contains an appropriate statement to this effect.

T½ in rats following oral administration of a single dose of 200 mg/kg was 0.75 h for the α - and 2.68 h for the β -phase. Similar T½ values were observed in dogs and monkeys. In rats, Cmax and AUC values tended to be higher in females than in males, whereas the opposite applied to dogs.

The  applicant has been asked to discuss the comparative pharmacokinetics in  humans  and experimental animals and the implications for a critical appraisal of the relevance of the main species used in the toxicity testing for human safety assessment. In summary, the rat and dog showed similar pharmacokinetic characteristics,  although  exposure  measured  as  AUC was higher in human than in either rat or dog at the NOAEL. The exposures measured in the maximum tolerated dose toxicokinetic studies (conducted in support of mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies) were, however, greater than in human subjects (Cmax 2.60- and 2.76-fold; AUC 1.21- and 1.64-fold for mouse and rat, respectively).

## 2.4 Toxicology

All toxicology studies were conducted by the applicant with the exception of data from literature for single dose toxicity and carcinogenicity in mice.

## 2.4.1 Single dose toxicity

Formal  single  dose  toxicity  studies  were  not  conducted.  A  review  of  published  literature  data identified  a  number  of  references  providing  LD50  values  in  several  species.  In  the  mouse,  LD50 values of 2960 - 3700 mg/kg following i.p. injection were identified; in the rat, LD50 values were 9990 mg/kg following p.o. administration, and 1700 mg/kg following i.p. injection. In the rabbit and dog, LD50 values in excess of 1000 mg/kg were reported following i.v. administration, which could be increased to over 7000 mg/kg with artificial respiration without lethality.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.2 Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Repeat-dose toxicity studies comprised 3- and 6-month toxicity studies in rats and 3- and 12-month studies  in  dogs.  Treatment-related  clinical  signs  were  mainly  related  to  sedation,  reduced  food consumption and secondary changes in body weight, body weight gain and organ weights.

In rats, the only treatment-related clinical chemistry changes were a slight reduction of serum albumin and WBC in rats that may have been related to changes in nutritional status. The lowest NOAEL value was 350 mg/kg/day in rats (AUC ≈ 200 µ g.h/ml) based on bodyweight changes.

In dogs, three repeat dose studies have been conducted, an initial rising dose study, followed by 90 day  and  52  week  exposure  studies.  In  the  rising  dose  study  single  doses  ranging  from  150  -  1800 mg/kg/day  were  investigated,  followed  by  a  5  day  continuous  dosing  phase  at  600  mg/kg/day. Treatment related clinical signs included emesis following dosing at 600 mg/kg and 1200 mg/kg and emesis, hypersalivation, ataxia and hypoactivity following the 1800 mg/kg dose. Emesis and ataxia were  also  observed  during  the  600  mg/kg/day  daily  dosing  phase.  Plasma  concentrations  were observed to increase in approximate proportion to increasing dose, with emesis leading to decreased plasma  concentrations.  These  signs  subsided  after  the  first  few  weeks  of  the  study,  and  led  to  the decision to increase the high dose to 900 mg/kg/day at Week 32. Following this dose increase, similar clinical signs were noted in the 900 mg/kg/day dose group.

There  were  no  treatment-related  clinical  chemistry,  ophthalmology  or  ECG  findings.  Necropsy findings included a dark area on the ileal mucosa of one animal, as a result of emesis during the study. A dose-dependent  atrophy  of  the  salivary  and  submucosal  oesophageal  glands  was  observed.  Such changes are not uncommon with drugs acting on the parasympathetic nervous system. The NOAEL value  was  150  mg/kg/day  (AUC ≈ 300 µ g.h/ml)  based  on  bodyweight  changes  and  salivary  gland atrophy.

The toxicokinetic parameters (mean values calculated from male and female data, since no apparent gender  difference  has  been  reported)  at  the  NOAEL  and/or  NOELs  in  the  repeat  dose  toxicology studies in rats and dogs are presented in the next table, together with pharmacokinetic parameters for humans from a study where the highest proposed dose of GHB was administered (2 x 4.5 g, 4 h apart, Study OMC-SXB-9).

| Species (Study)                | Dose                    | Cm(μg/ml)   | Tm (h)    | T: (h)   |   AUCo.(ug.h/iml) |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Human (OMC-SXB-9)              | 2 x 4.5g: Dose 1 Dose 2 | 77.6 142    | 1.17 0.72 | 0.83     |             518   |

| Dog 52 week (Covance 6627-118) | 150 mg/kg/day           | 158.5       | 0.875     | 0.99     |             286.3 |

NOAELNOEL

At the NOAEL observed in both rat repeat dose toxicology studies, mean AUC and Cmax values were approx 0.5 fold the values in humans. After the second 4.5 g dose in humans, the Cmax values for rats and humans were approximately the same. At the lowest NOEL for dogs, observed in the dog 52 week toxicology  study  (150  mg/kg/day),  the  exposure  margin  for  AUC  was  approximately  0.5  fold  the values observed in humans. The exposure margin for Cmax was approx 0.5 fold the value following the first dose in humans and approximately the same following the second dose in humans. Thus, with the exception of Cmax values following the second GHB dose in humans, exposure to GHB in both rats and dogs was less than observed for humans at the highest proposed therapeutic dose.

## 2.4.3 Genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo

Genotoxicity  studies  in  vitro  (bacterial  mutation  assays  in  salmonella  and  E.coli  and  chromosomal aberrations  in  CHO  cells  in  absence  and  presence  of  metabolic  activation)  and  in  vivo  (rat

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

micronucleus test) did not identify a cause for concern. Sodium oxybate may be considered as nongenotoxic.

## 2.4.4 Carcinogenicity (with toxicokinetics)

There is available data on rat and mouse with γ -butyrolactone (GBL which converts in GHB rapidly in the  body)  in  two  NTP  (National  Toxicology  Program)  studies  and  with  sodium  oxybate  in  rats (applicant-sponsored  2-year  study).  In  the  rat  carcinogenicity  study  the  active  substance  was administered as sodium oxybate (maximum dose 1000 mg/kg). In the National Toxicology Program mouse  carcinogenicity  study  (CAS  No.  96-48-0)  the  active  substance  was  administered  as  GBL (maximum dose 525 mg/kg). Provided that no toxicokinetic data was included in the NTP studies, single dose and 14 day dose bridging studies were conducted by the applicant in both rat and mouse to estimate the exposure in these species following administration of sodium oxybate or γ -butyrolactone (GBL)  in  support  of  these  carcinogenicity  studies.  The  exposures  in  rat  and  mouse  at  the  doses corresponding to the maximum doses in the respective carcinogenicity studies was compared to the exposures  in  humans  at  the  maximum  recommended  dose  of  9g,  administered  as  two  4.5g  doses  4 hours apart (OMC-SXB-9). The animal/human exposure ratios for Cmax were 2.60 and 2.76 for mouse and  rat,  respectively.  Similarly  the  animal/human  exposure  ratios  for  AUC  were  1.21  and  1.64  for mouse and rat, respectively. It is not clear whether data from short-term administration (up to 14 days) is informative regarding the exposure of animals at the end of the study, provided that accumulation seemed  to  occur  at  least  at  high  doses,  as  suggested  by  comparative  toxicokinetic  analysis  of  the values obtained in repeated dose studies in rats and dogs. Underestimation of exposure may therefore be given in the bridging studies.

GBL has been classified by NTP as non-carcinogenic in rats and equivocal carcinogen in mice, due to slight  increase  of  pheochromocytomas  which  was  difficult  to  interpret  due  to  high  mortality  in  the high dose group. With GBL a non-significant increase of hyperplasia of adrenal medulla was observed also in rats, which poses the possibility of a drug-related effect in both species. Decreased incidence of several neoplasm types in mice (hepatocellular tumors) and rats  (mammary  fibroadenomas) administered with GBL were also observed in the NTP study.

In rats, both sodium  oxybate  (applicant-sponsored  study)  and  GBL  were  classified  as  noncarcinogenic. In the oxybate study 2/50 pituitary carcinomas were observed in high-dose female rats compared  to  0/50  in  all  other  groups  including  controls.  However,  this  finding  was  of  doubtful statistical significance and the incidence was at the upper bound of historical controls. Since GHB was non-genotoxic and the pituitary carcinomas in the rat were of marginal statistical significance, there is sufficient information to assume that Xyrem is unlikely to be a potential carcinogen in humans. The safety ratios calculated against predicted human exposure were still low but new studies do not seem necessary as no concern has been raised from the available toxicological data.

## 2.4.5 Reproductive and developmental studies

GHB had no effect on mating, general fertility or sperm parameters and did not produce embryo-foetal toxicity in rats exposed to up 1000 mg/kg/day GHB. As there are no PK data in pregnant animals, the corresponding exposure margin, calculated from non-pregnant animals is 1.64 times the human one.

In  rabbits,  foetotoxicity  was  slight  and  did  not  reach  statistical  significance.  The  only  notable abnormality was hydrocephalus in two foetuses from the same litter in a mid-dose female. Based on historical data provided and taking into consideration that there were no similar findings in any other litter or dose group, this finding was considered to be unrelated to treatment. The rabbit study included toxicokinetics. The highest Cmax recorded was 454 µ g/ml, which is 3-fold higher than the predicted human value.

GHB had no adverse effects on the F0 animals in a conventional Segment III study in rats, except for an  increase  in  the  incidence  of  post-dose  sedation,  low  bodyweight  gain  and  reduced  food consumption  in  the  high-dose  group.  Perinatal  mortality  was  increased  and  mean  pup  weight  was decreased during the lactation period in high-dose F1 animals. Though not dose related, a relationship of  these  mortalities  with  the  treatment  cannot  be  ruled  out.  GHB  is  not  to  be  recommended  during pregnancy or breast-feeding and this is reflected in the SPC.

## 2.4.6 Other toxicity studies

Immunotoxicity studies were not carried out. However, there were no signals of direct immunotoxicity in any of the repeat-dose toxicity studies.

## Dependance studies

GHB is a known substance of abuse and in the United States the use of Xyrem is subject to a rigid risk management program. The applicant did not conduct specific animal tests for dependence. However, a review  of  the  published  literature  was  carried  out  to  collect  information  on  the  effects  of  GHB  in models  of  drug  discrimination,  self-administration  and  tolerance.  Drug  discrimination  studies  show that GHB produces a unique discriminative stimulus that in some respects is similar to that of alcohol, morphine and certain GABA-mimetic drugs. However, the characteristics of these effects differ with dose, suggesting the involvement of multiple receptor systems with varied affinities for GHB. Selfadministration studies in rats, mice and monkeys have produced conflicting results, whereas tolerance to GHB as well as cross-tolerance to alcohol has been clearly demonstrated in rodents.

The data generated in the file does not allow evaluation of the potential of sodium oxybate to induce withdrawal phenomena. The literature review suggest that mild effects could occur in mice and rats after  frequent  daily  administration  and  in  primates  after  continuous  long  term  administration  (more than 30 days) of 750mg/kg/day dose. The potential for withdrawal seems therefore to exist, though limited.  This  is  reflected  in  the  SPC  and  will  be  further  evaluated  clinically  as  a  post-marketing commitment.

## 2.5 Environmental risk assessment

A formal environmental risk assessment has not been carried out. It is nevertheless agreed that sodium oxybate is unlikely to pose any perceivable risk to the environment.

## 2.6 Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

The  precise  mechanism  by  which  sodium  oxybate  produces  an  effect  on  cataplexy  is  unknown, however sodium oxybate is thought to act by promoting slow (delta) wave sleep and consolidating night-time sleep. The cause of human narcolepsy and cataplexy is, as yet, unknown. Recent evidence points  to  the  loss  of  hypocretin-containing  neurons,  possibly  due  to  autoimmune  attack,  as  a  likely cause. Animal models of cataplexy and narcolepsy are continuing to be developed, but the effects of GHB in these models, have yet to be investigated.

In  addition  to  its  sedative  properties,  GHB  is  a  potent  CNS  depressant  and  may  increase  growth hormone secretion. The potential for acute respiratory depression after reintroduction of treatment in patients who might have developed tolerance is mentioned in the SPC (4.2) as well as a warning in case of concomitant administration with other CNS depressant, and especially alcohol. (SPC, 4.4 and 4.5)

The  interactions  resulting  from  the  stimulation  or  inhibition  of  GHB  dehydrogenase,  namely  with anticonvulsivant  drugs  and  L-dopa  are  considered  to  be  potentially  relevant  in  the  clinic  and  are mentioned in the SPC.(section 4.5 and 5.3).

The  bioavailability  in  rats  is  about  50-80%  and  the  clearance  is  rapid  (T½ ≈ 1h)  with  extensive biotransformation which  is not P450  dependant.  The  kinetic is non-linear, due  to saturable mechanisms of both absorption and elimination resulting in reduced Cmax and increased AUC from linearity with increasing doses. As GHB is metabolised by γ hydroxybutyrate (GHB) dehydrogenase, there  is  a  potential  interaction  with  drugs  that  inhibit  this  enzyme.  This  is  reflected  in  the  SPC (sections 4.5 and 5.3)

In  repeat-dose  toxicity,  treatment-related  clinical  signs  were  mainly  related  to  sedation.  Safety margins, based on body weight changes and salivary gland atrophy, are low or non-existent. This is in accordance with the frequent occurrence in humans of adverse effects such as nausea, anorexia and parasympathetic disorders (blurred vision, enuresis and sweating).

GHB is non-genotoxic and not considered to present a carcinogenic risk to humans.

In reproductive toxicity studies, foetoxicity was observed in rats and rabbits. The use of GHB is not recommended during pregnancy or breast-feeding and this is reflected in the SPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tolerance to GHB as well as cross-tolerance to alcohol has been clearly demonstrated in rodents. The potential of GHB to induce withdrawal phenomena, demonstrated in animal models, is low, and the relevance for humans will be monitored in the future during the post-authorisation phase.

## 3 Clinical aspects

## 3.1 Introduction

Sodium oxybate is directed to the treatment of cataplexy in narcolepsy which is an orphan disease and the development plan reflects this status. The database is small and the claims are supported by studies that in part were conducted on the initiative of the investigators. The sponsor put particularly efforts in one main pivotal study which is of reasonable size with more than 100 patients enrolled.

All analytical methods used were validated. An overview of the pharmacological studies is given in the following table:

## 3.2 Pharmacokinetics

The following pharmacokinetic characteristics of sodium oxybate can be described as follows:

## 3.2.1 Absorption and Bioavailability/Bioequivalence

Xyrem is presented as an oral solution (500 mg/ml). As sodium oxybate is highly soluble and all the formulations used in the clinical trials were solutions with no excipients except for pH adjustment, no formulation effect is thus expected. Therefore the absence of bioequivalence studies is acceptable.

Sodium oxybate was rapidly absorbed following oral administration in solution. The mean /median time  to  achieve  peak  plasma  concentration  (Tmax)  ranged  from  around  0.5  to  1.25  hours  in  both healthy volunteers and patients with narcolepsy.

Absolute  bioavailability  was  not  studied  to  avoid  potential  safety  issues  following  intravenous administration.  In  the  literature,  limited  data  suggest  a  bioavailability  of  27%.  This  low  figure  is probably due to a high first pass metabolism.

## Influence of food

A clear effect of food on the absorption of sodium oxybate was demonstrated in study OMC-SXB-11. Food  intake  reduces  Cmax  by  59%,  AUC  by  37%  and  variability  in  both  parameters  as  well. Administration after a high fat meal showed a slower absorption, resulting in a longer Tmax (2 hours) compared with administration after an overnight fast (0.75 hours). It is considered unlikely that these

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

small  differences  in  Tmax  may  have  any  clinical  impact.  However,  as  the  concentration/response relationship  has  not  been  well  established,  it  is  recommended  that  the  proposed  posology  closely follows what has been used in the clinical trials and that patients should observe the same timing of dosing in relation to meals and upon retiring to bed .

## 3.2.2 Distribution

Palatini and colleagues (1993) showed that there was essentially no plasma protein binding (&lt;1%) in their study of one volunteer at pre-dialysis concentrations of 3, 10, 20, 100, 200 and 300 mg/ml.

In study OMC-SXB-11, the apparent volume of distribution tended to be higher after the high fat meal than in the fasted situation (Vz/F was 26.9 L and 13.4 L respectively, as referred to 70 kg with rsd% of 84.4% and 101% respectively). The large variability is probably due to the absolute bioavailability factor (F).

## 3.2.3 Elimination

GHB is eliminated  via  two  metabolic  pathways:  beta-oxidation  and  TCA  cycle.  Renal  excretion  is negligible (3 to &lt; 10%). Half-life ranges from 0.57 to 0.83 h with an average rsd% of 33.3% across all studies.  Total  clearance  (Cl/F  ml/min/kg) ranges from 2.51 to 5.07 with an average rsd% of 25.9% across all studies.

The main PK parameters are summarised in the next 2 tables:

## 3.2.4 Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Study  OMC-SXB-9  in  healthy  volunteers  and  studies  OMC-SX-10  OMC-GHB-4  in  patients respectively addressed the issue of dose dependency and steady-state.

The non-linearity found in study OMC-SXB-9 has not been fully explained. Since sodium oxybate undergoes  extensive  first-pass  metabolism  (oral  absolute  bioavailability  is  about  28%),  the  nonlinearity can be due to saturation of either pre-systemic or systemic elimination. A slight increase in the  half-life  is  observed  (see  table  4  below),  but  statistical  significance  cannot  be  tested  due  to confounding factors such as divided dose and food effect.

Studies OMC-SXB-10 and OMC-GHB-4 did not show evidence of a strong dose-dependency.

Overall,  a  careful  monitoring  upon  individual  dose  titration  is  recommended  and  is  reflected  in  the SPC.

Table 4: Dose proportionality study

## 3.2.5 Special populations

The  applicant  did  not  perform  studies  in  special  populations:  sodium  oxybate  is  not  intended  for children or elderly because narcolepsy/cataplexy has a very low prevalence in those age brackets.

As  sodium  oxybate  is  eliminated  almost  exclusively  via  biotransformation,  no  renal  impairment effects are expected. Therefore the only recommendation in patients with compromised renal function is a possible reduction in sodium intake since 4.5 g of sodium oxybate contains 0.75 g of sodium. This is stated in the SPC.

Based  on  a  published  study,  the  dosing  recommendation  in  the  SPC  for  patients  with  hepatic impairment, is to halve the starting dose in such patients, and to monitor closely the response to dose increments.

## 3.2.6 Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

GHB is metabolised  via  beta-oxidation  or  tricarboxylic  acid  cycle  (Krebs)  pathways.  Therefore  no involvement  of  CYP  isoenzymes  is  expected.  This  has  been  confirmed  by in  vitro studies  for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Four drug-drug interaction studies have been performed (OMC-SXB-12,-14,-17,-24). No significant interactions have been detected of either GHB on zolpidem, protriptyline and modafinil or of the same drugs on GHB. However, the rate of adverse events in co-administration with protriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, was increased both in healthy subjects and patients. Therefore a potential pharmacodynamic interaction cannot be excluded with antidepressants. This is stated in the SPC.

Omeprazole did not show significant interaction on GHB pharmacokinetics.

There  is  also  a  suggestion  in  primates  that  the  antiepileptic  drugs  valproate,  ethosuximide  and phenytoin can influence activity of gamma-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase in the initial conversion of gammahydroxybutyrate to succinic semialdehyde (Snead 1978a, 1978b). As GHB is metabolised by gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) dehydrogenase, there is a potential interaction with drugs that inhibit this enzyme. These drugs include but are not limited to valproate, phenytoin, ethosuximide, salicylate, amobarbital, disulfiram and cyanide, and trimethadione. As the interaction of Xyrem with drugs that inhibit GHB dehydrogenase was not studied in human subjects, it is not known clinically what effects these drugs would have if administered concurrently (i.e. in patients being treated with anticonvulsants). L-DOPA, a precursor to dopamine, which increases dopamine levels, has also been shown  to  potentiate  Xyrem's  hypnotic  effects,  although  studies  in  primates  have  shown  that  coadministration of L-DOPA and GHB may result in a reduction in serum concentrations of GHB.

## 3.3 Pharmacodynamics

## 3.3.1 Mechanism of action

The mechanism of action is largely unknown. The applicant did not produce any original data. The summary below is based in the published literature.

Sodium oxybate is an endogenous 4-carbon fatty acid that is thought to act as a neurotransmitter in the regulation of sleep cycles, blood flow, emotion, and memory. Its actions are thought to be mediated through brain receptors specific for GHB as well as through binding to GABA-B receptors. At low doses, the drug inhibits presynaptic dopamine release, while at high doses, dopamine release may be stimulated. It is believed that sodium oxybate decreases the symptoms of narcolepsy by inducing REM sleep  and  increasing  delta  sleep.  The  precise  mechanism  by  which  sodium  oxybate  produces  anticataplectic activity in patients with narcolepsy is unknown.

## 3.3.2 Primary and Secondary pharmacology

Sodium oxybate is a central nervous system depressant, pharmacotherapeutic group: Other Nervous System Drugs, ATC code: N07XX04 hydroxybutyric acid.

Sodium oxybate is directed to the treatment of cataplexy in Narcolepsy and the model to propose this indication is based on the current understanding that narcolepsy symptoms should be categorised in 2 groups: 1) daytime sleepiness and sleep fragmentation; 2) Cataplexy and REM related symptoms.

Anesthetic induction is thought to occur from a general CNS depressant effect on the cerebrospinal axis,  and  occurs  at  higher  dosages.  Intoxication  with  sodium  oxybate  or  GHB  can  produce  severe symptoms including seizures, respiratory depression, CNS depression, coma, and death.

## Endocrine effects

It is known from the literature that GHB exhibits effects on growth hormone, cortisol and prolactin. Available  literature  data  from  human  studies  show  that  oxybate  (gammahydroxybutyrate;  GHB) consistently provokes small, short-lived increases in growth hormone (GH) release, whereas, the data from animal studies is less clear; vide infra. In contrast, evidence in the literature of any substantial effect  of  GHB  on  either  Prolactin  (PRL)  or  cortisol  release  is  weak.  Likewise,  neither  IGF-I  nor IGFBP-3, indices of hypersecretion of GH (MacGillivray, 2001), are consistently altered (van Cauter, et al, 1997) and other hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis appear to be unaffected by GHB, there  being  little  or  no  effect  on  thyroid  stimulating  hormone,  thyroxine,  melatonin  or  luteinising hormone (Oyama et al, 1972, Gerra 1994a, van Cauter, et al, 1997).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the clinical trial database, more than 80 % of patients maintained concomitant stimulant use.

Stimulants  such  as  methylphenidate,  dextroamphetamine,  methamphetamine,  pemoline  or  modafinil are used commonly to treat the symptoms of daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  -  such  as protryptiline, amitriptyline,  chlomipramine,  imipramine  and trimipramine - or serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - such as fluoxetine, sertraline and paroxetine -are used to treat the REM-dissociation phenomena of cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations  and  sleep  paralysis.  The  seven  trials  that  comprise  the  clinical  trial  database  did  not include  a  trial  designed  to  specifically  investigate  the  potential  pharmacodynamic  interactions  of sodium  oxybate  with  other  concomitant  medications  in  this  patient  population.  A  re-analysis considering subgroups defined by the concomitant use of stimulants or tricyclic antidepressants was performed  at  the  request  of  CHMP.  No  signals  of  a  pharmacodynamic  interaction  were  shown. However, due to the small numbers and the inherent limitation of post-hoc analysis a pharmacodynamic interactions with CNS stimulants or TCA antidepressants cannot be ruled out and this is reflected in the SPC.

## 3.4 Clinical efficacy

The use of sodium oxybate (sodium gamma hydroxybutyrate) in narcolepsy dates back to open-label clinical  trials  conducted  by  Broughton  and  Mamelak  (1979  and  1980).  These  trials,  along  with subsequent  open-label  trials  (Scharf  et  al,  1985;  Mamelak  et  al,  1986;  Montplaisir  and  Godbout, 1986),  provided  early  evidence  that  sodium  oxybate  was  effective  in  the  treatment  of  narcolepsy symptoms.

Efficacy  data  from  seven  completed  clinical  trials,  to  support  the  use  of  sodium  oxybate  for  the treatment of cataplexy associated with narcolepsy, are included in this application.

## Controlled studies

There are four controlled studies:

- Randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled comparison of 3, 6 and 9 g of sodium oxybate (given in two divided doses) versus placebo in 136 patients treated for 4 weeks (OMC-GHB-2);
-  Randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  crossover  comparison  of  sodium  oxybate  (2  x  25 mg/kg) and placebo in 20 patients treated for 29 days (Scrima).
-  Randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  crossover  comparison  of  sodium  oxybate  (2  x  30 mg/kg) and placebo in 25 patients treated for 4 weeks (Lammers).
-  Randomized,  long-term,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled  study  to  compare  continued  sodium oxybate (3, 4.5, 6, 7.5 or 9 g/night in two divided doses) with placebo in 56 patients over a 2-week treatment period following long-term sodium oxybate treatment (OMC-SXB-21).

All  studies  included  patients  with  an  established  diagnosis  of  narcolepsy,  although  the  precise inclusion and exclusion criteria varied between studies. In all four studies, the number of cataplexy attacks  is  the  primary  efficacy  variable  (or  is  one  of  the  stated  primary  efficacy  variables)  and  was obtained from diary cards filled in by the patients. Pre-existing stimulant medication was maintained in all studies.

The  two  pivotal  studies  for  determination  of  the  effects  against  cataplexy  are  OMC-GHB-  2  and OMC-SXB-21.

All  four  controlled  studies  assessed  various  symptoms  of  narcolepsy,  in  addition  to  the  change  in number  of  cataplexy  attacks,  although  the  actual  assessments  varied  between  the  studies.  Several assessments were made by the patient (including the number of hypnagogic hallucinations, daytime naps, and daytime sleepiness). In the pivotal OMCGHB- 2 study, groups were compared for daytime sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and there was an investigator assessment of severity of the patient's illness by the Clinical Global Impression of Change. The Scrima and Lammers studies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

included  polysomnogram  recordings,  but  data  were  not  available  for  the  Lammers  study  report. Scrima published the polysomnogram and multiple sleep latency test data from his study (Scrima et al, 1990), but the results presented are based upon those presented in the Scrima study report. Patients in the Scrima study had a mean prevalence of cataplexy episodes of approximately 20 per week, whilst those in the Lammers study had approximately five episodes per week.

The results from the controlled studies demonstrating a reduction l in the number of cataplexy attacks and improvement of other narcolepsy symptoms are supported by those from three open label noncomparative studies:

## Open-label studies

·  The  open  label  extension  trial,  OMC-GHB-3,  extended  the  analysis  of  efficacy  and  safety  from OMC-GHB-2 for an additional 12 months and served to further validate the endpoints in OMC-GHB2. Patients began treatment at 6 g/night and the dose was subsequently adjusted to effect. The study included 117 treated patients.

• OMC-SXB-6 was an open-label 6-month study in 185 patients treated with 3, 4.5,

6, 7.5 or 9 g/day, titrated from a starting dose of 4.5 g/night to effect.

· OMC-SXB-20 was an open label study examining the effects of four doses of sodium oxybate (4.5 g, 6 g, 7.5 g and 9 g) on overnight polysomnogram recordings in 25 treated patients. In addition, patients from OMC-GHB-3, OMC-SXB-6 or the Scharf (safety) study could enter the long-term study OMCSXB-7. An interim analysis, when 145/300 patients had been entered and treated, is included in this application.

In OMC-GHB-3, the number of cataplexy attacks is recorded, amongst other assessments. In the other open  studies  a  narcolepsy  symptom  questionnaire  was  used  to  assess  symptoms  and  response.  The primary objective of study OMC-SXB-20 was not, however, to assess the effects against cataplexy but to characterise the polysomnographic sleep architecture in narcoleptic patients at the doses of sodium oxybate  that  were  to  be  used  therapeutically.  In  this  study,  patients  were  withdrawn  from  tricyclic antidepressant,  specific  serotonin-reuptake  inhibitors  and  hypnotics  over  a  2-week  period  and  were maintained for further 2-weeks without such medication. Overnight polysomnograms were recorded at the  beginning  and  end  of  the  4-week  period.  Patients  then  received  sodium  oxybate  at  4.5  g  for  4 weeks, 6 g for 2 weeks, 7.5 g for 2 weeks and 9 g for 2 weeks and a polysomnogram was recorded on the last night of each dose level. The study assessments also included subjective determinations of the effects of sodium oxybate on daytime sleepiness (using the Epworth Sleepiness scale) and the wellestablished Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT).

The  pharmacokinetic  studies  have  assessed  a  night  time  equally  divided  dose,  between  4g  and  9g. Because of the non-linear kinetics of sodium oxybate a decision was made not to further elevate the maximum dose of 9g, because of the potential for tolerability problems.

The  minimum  effective  dose  has  also  not  been  fully  assessed.  The  clinical  efficacy  studies  were designed to assess a lowest dose of 3g nightly in equally divided doses. This is based on the efficacy data that had been apparent in previous (non-sponsor, published literature) studies.

A decision was made to clinically evaluate dosing at night time, based on the rationale of mechanism of action, which propose that a normalisation of night time REM sleep will have effect on daytime REM phenomena (such as cataplexy) and also based on clinical experience in earlier trials.

## 3.4.1 Dose response studies

The studies designed by SCRIMA and LAMMERS were randomised, placebo controlled studies of investigator  initiative  that  were  performed  several  years  before  the  pivotal  trials.  These  2  studies provide background data to the pivotal studies and can be considered therapeutic exploratory studies.

SCRIMA STUDY: The effects of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), 25 mg/kg orally at bedtime and 3 hours  later,  on  cataplexy  and  sleep  in  narcolepsy  patients:  a  doubleblind,  placebo-controlled  study (Scrima).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Objectives: To evaluate as primary variables average daily number of cataplexy attacks and objective daytime sleepiness using the sleepiness index determined by the multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) in narcolepsy patients during treatment with GHB as compared with placebo (PLC) and baseline.

To evaluate as secondary variables average number of sleep attacks, average number of awakenings per night, dosing requirement of methylphenidate, feelings on awakening, mood in the morning and evening, sleep patterns identified on the polysomnogram (PSG), and average number of REM onsets determined by the MSLT during treatment with GHB as compared with placebo and baseline

## Results:

The mean number of cataplexy attacks is summarized below; the data indicate that GHB was superior to placebo at Weeks 3 and 4 and overall. There was no evidence of carryover.

By  week  4,  GHB  was  superior  to  placebo  for  16/19  patients  (84  %).  No  cataplexy  attacks  were reported for 4/19 (21 %) of patients during week 4 of GHB compared with 1/19 (5 %) during week 4 of placebo.

Pre-study  mean  MSLT  sleepiness  index  was  88.5.  Although  the  mean  sleepiness  index  was  lower during GHB treatment than placebo treatment (87.2 versus 90.3) there was no significant treatment effect (p = 0.085).

The  PSG  results  revealed  statistically  significant  differences  between  GHB  and  placebo  which  are modest. With regard to overall sleep efficiency on Days 1 and 29 (84.4 % versus 88.1 %, p = 0.023), sleep latency (3.5 versus 2.5 min, p = 0.028), Stage 1 sleep (23.0 % versus 27.0 %, p = 0.042), Stage 3 sleep (5.5 % versus 2.8 %, p = 0.003), stage shifts (109.9 versus 129.2, p = 0.006), and number of objective awakenings (21.8 versus 26.9, p = 0.012). On Day 1, GHB and placebo differed significantly with regard to sleep efficiency (83.5% versus 87.8 %, p = 0.019), stage shifts (102.9 versus 125.1, p = 0.005),  and  number  of  objective  awakenings  (20.7  versus  25.1,  p  =  0.049).  On  Day  29,  GHB  and placebo differed with respect to stage 1 sleep (24.3 % versus 28.6 %, p = 0.026), Stage 3 sleep (6.7 % versus 2.3 %, p = 0.001), and number of objective awakenings (22.8 versus 28.6, p = 0.042).

There were no differences with respect to Stage 2 sleep, Stage 4 sleep, REM sleep or REM latency. There was also no difference in relationship to the number of MSLT REM onsets.

LAMMERS Study: Prospective,  double-blind,  cross-over,  randomised  study  to  assess  the  effect  of gamma-hydroxybutyrate in patients with narcolepsy (Lammers)

Objectives: To investigate whether:

-  gamma-hydroxybutyrate,  in  a  double-  blind  study,  has  an  effect  on  the  REM  -dissociation phenomena and possibly on the elevated inclination to sleep during the day;
- gamma-hydroxybutyrate affects the alertness during the day; and·
- gamma-hydroxybutyrate has a mood-improving effect.

Results:  A  Significant  improvement  was  shown  in  the  two  primary  efficacy  parameters  (global improvement and number of cataplexy attacks).  In  addition  significant  improvement  was  shown  in daytime sleepiness, number of daytime sleep attacks and number of night-time awakenings. Its longterm  safety  was  not  determined  in  this  trial,  but  the  treatment  was  very  well  tolerated  by  the  vast majority of the trial patients over a 4-week course of therapy.

## 3.4.2 Main studies

The two pivotal studies for determination of the effects against cataplexy are OMC-GHB-2 and OMCSXB-21.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In OMC-GHB-2, patients were tapered from their existing anti-cataplexy treatment over a period of 1 day to 4 weeks and there was then a washout period of 5-28 days (dependent upon the half-life of the previous medication), followed by a baseline period of 2-3 weeks during which no cataplexy treatment was  given.  The  double-blind  comparative  phase  was  followed  by  a  3-5  day  period  without  any cataplexy treatment. Patients were randomized to a low (3 g), medium (6 g) or high (9 g) fixed dose of sodium oxybate, enabling comparison of each of the three doses against placebo.

## STUDY OMC-GHB-2

Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre trial comparing the effects of three doses of orally administered Xyrem (sodium gamma-hydroxy-butyrate or sodium oxybate or GHB) with placebo for the treatment of narcolepsy (OMC-GHB-2)

| Withdrawal of treatment for cataplexy | No treatment for cataplexy | No treatment for cataplexy | Placebo or GHB 3g.6g, or 9g | No treatment for cataplexy |

## · Study Participants

Diagnostic criteria: Current diagnosis of narcolepsy for a least 6 months according to the following two items of criteria A as established by the American Sleep Disorders Association (ASDA): recurrent daytime naps or lapses into sleep than occur almost daily for at least 3 months; sudden bilateral loss of postural tone in association with intense emotion (cataplexy).

## · Treatments

Sodium oxybate, 3 g, 6 g or 9 g, divided into two nightly doses

## · Objectives

To  evaluate  and  compare  the  efficacy  of  three  doses  (3  g,  6  g  and  9  g)  of  sodium  gammahydroxybutyrate and placebo in the treatment of the symptoms of narcolepsy.

To  evaluate  and  compare  the  safety  of  GHB  with  placebo  when  used  in  a  narcoleptic  patient population.

## · Endpoints

Primary efficacy parameter: total number of cataplexy attacks. Secondary efficacy parameters:

- number of complete and partial cataplexy attacks,
- hypnagogic hallucinations,
- sleep paralysis episodes,
- excessive daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, number and

duration of sleep attacks/inadvertent naps,

- number of night-time awakenings,
- total amount of sleep,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- severity of the patient's illness by Clinical Global Impressions of Change.

## · Sample size

Planned: 104 patients (26 in each of four groups)

Studied: 136 patients (57 M, 79 F, mean 43.1 y); 34 (7 M, 27 F, mean 47.1 y) treated with 3 g/day, 33 (21 M, 12 F, mean 43.5 y) with 6 g/day, 35 (17 M, 18 F, mean 40.9 y) with 9 g/day and 34 (12 M, 22F, mean 40.8 y) with placebo.

## · Outcomes and estimation

At 9 g, 4.5 g taken at bedtime and 4.5 g taken 2.5-4 hours later, sodium oxybate produced a significant improvement in total number of cataplexy attacks per week; the reduction was also significant for the 6 g dose in the FDA's reanalysis of results by ANOVA. The following table shows the results for both ANCOVA and ANOVA; the latter are shown after the /, where appropriate.

The clinical global impression is summarised below as responders (those who were much improved or very much improved) and non-responders (minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, very much worse).

The proportion of responders was notably and significantly higher in the 9 g group.

The  median  change  in  excessive  daytime  sleepiness  as  assessed  by  the  Epworth  Sleepiness  Scale (ESS) is shown below.

At baseline the number of patients with an ESS of 13 or higher in the placebo, 3 g, 6 g and 9 g groups was 30, 28, 27 and 25, respectively. At endpoint, 2, 7, 9 and 12 of these patients had scores of less than 13 and 1, 3, 3, and 6 had scores of less than 10 (= normal).

Other  efficacy  variables  showed  a  positive  effect  of  sodium  oxybate.  The  median  change  from baseline in the number of inadvertent nap/sleep attacks in the placebo, 3 g, 6 g and 9 g groups from baseline to endpoint was -0.26, -0.20, -0.48 and -0.48 and the 6 g (p = 0.0497) and 9 g groups (p = 0.0122) differed significantly from the placebo group. The median change from baseline to endpoint in the number of awakenings per night was 0.20 for placebo, -0.25 for 3 g, -0.21 for 6 g and -0.91 for 9 g. The 9 g and placebo groups differed significantly (p = 0.0035).

There  were  no  significant  differences  between  groups  with  regard  to  the  change  from  baseline  to endpoint  in  median  number  of  hypnagogic  hallucinations,  sleep  paralysis  episodes,  total  amount  of sleep and duration of inadvertent naps/sleep attacks.

After treatment was stopped, the number of attacks of cataplexy increased: in the 9 g/day group, the median change in the number of attacks per week from end of treatment to follow-up 3-5 days later was +4.7 (p = 0.0017, n = 27) and in the 6 g/day group the median change was +6.1 (p = 0.0001, n = 29). The changes in the placebo and 3 g groups were not significant (+1.9, n = 30, and +2.3, n = 29). There was no evidence of rebound: the median change in the number of weekly cataplexy attacks from baseline to 3-5 days after end of treatment was -11.6 for the 9 g/day group (p = 0.0001). The number of attacks was thus still lower than at baseline (median 29.2).

This is a relapse-prevention like design but in this case patients were already treated with GHB for several  years.  The  test  situation  consisted  in  withdrawing  patients  from  their  usual  treatment  by switching to placebo under double-blind conditions. This study allows the evaluation of the risk of a withdrawal and rebound phenomenon.

## · Objectives

To provide evidence for the long-term efficacy of Xyrem based on the return of cataplexy symptoms upon cessation of a minimum of 6 months of open label treatment with Xyrem and to evaluate the safety of Xyrem.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

Efficacy: Change in the number of cataplexy attacks from the baseline (2- week single-blind lead-in phase) to endpoint (2-week double-blind treatment phase).

Safety:  Assessment  of  AEs  and  changes  in  clinical  laboratory  results,  vital  signs,  and  physical examinations.

The baseline characteristics of the 2 groups differ in parameter that constitutes the primary endpoint number of cataplexy attacks. At baseline, the number of cataplexy attacks were much higher in the placebo  group  (median  =4.0)  than  in  the  active  group  (median=1.9).  This  is  due  to  the  wide  interpatient variability in the frequency of cataplexy attacks.

There was no change in the number of cataplexy attacks from baseline (2-week single-blind treatment ith  Xyrem only) to endpoint (2-week double-blind treatment with Xyrem or placebo) in the Xyrem

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

group  (median  change  0.0),  while  cataplexy  attacks  increased  by  a  median  of  21.0  in  the  placebo group  (see  table).  This  difference  was  statistically  significant  (p  &lt;  0.001)  when  analysed  by  an ANCOVA  model  containing  rank  baseline,  treatment  group,  and  baseline-by-treatment  group interaction. The change from baseline in the number of cataplexy attacks by week during the doubleblind period mirrors the overall change from baseline: no change in the Xyrem group (median change 0.0, each week), while cataplexy attacks increased in the placebo group by a median of 4.2 in Week 1, and 11.7 in Week 2.

The results (number of cataplexy attacks/week) are shown by week in the next table.

Rebound reactions in term of efficacy were characterized as a return to a level of cataplexy attacks per week that exceeded the original (pre-treatment) baseline levels.

Relative to subjects who remained on sodium oxybate, in subjects in the placebo group there was a small increase in the number of cataplexy attacks during the first and the second week of interruption of  treatment  with  sodium  oxybate  (Week  3  and  Week  4  of  the  study).  The  median  change  from baseline  in  the  number  of  cataplexy  attacks/week  was  4.2  during  the  first  week  after  cessation  of sodium oxybate, and 11.7 in the second week.

Thus there is evidence of a gradual increase in incidence of cataplexy on withdrawal of treatment. This is reflected in the SPC (section 4.4)

Withdrawal symptoms are discussed in the Clinical Safety section of this report.

## Open-label supportive studies

## Long-term,  open-label,  multi-centre  extension  trial  of  orally  administered  Xyrem  (sodium gamma-hydroxybutyrate) for the treatment of narcolepsy symptoms.

OMC-GHB-3 (US) was a long-term, Phase III, open-label, multicentre extension trial with the primary objective of evaluating the safety, and the secondary objective of evaluating the efficacy of sodium oxybate when used for 12 months in patients with narcolepsy.

The dose, calculated as the average dose used by the patient over the course of their involvement in the first 12 months of the trial, was 3 g for 15 patients, 4.5 g for 20, 6 g for 37, 7.5 g for 25 and 9 g for 20 patients. The total number of patients included in the analysis of the number of cataplexy attacks was 103 at 1 month, and reduced to 75 at 12 months and 52 at 18 month. The greatest reduction in number of cataplexy attacks occurred during the first month of sodium oxybate treatment. The change was  significant  at  every  visit  (p  &lt;  0.001).  There  was  no  difference  between  doses  (patients  being titrated to clinical effect). The improvement in the number of cataplexy attacks was paralleled by an improvement in excessive daytime sleepiness as assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). At  1  month,  the  median  change  in  the  number  of  cataplexy  attacks  per  week  was  -15.08  (-76.7% reduction from baseline), and the median change in ESS was -3.50. At 6 and 12 months, the median reduction in number of cataplexy attacks was -19.00 (-92.5%) and - 23.0 (-93.1%), respectively. The corresponding change in ESS was -5.0 at each of these time-points.

## Open-label, multicentre 6-month trial of Xyrem (sodium oxybate) oral solution for the treatment of narcolepsy in trial drug-naïve patients

The OMC-SXB-6 trial (US) was a Phase III, open-label, multicentre trial with the primary objective of evaluating the safety and the secondary objective of evaluating the efficacy of sodium oxybate when

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

titrated  from  a  starting  dosage  of  4.5  g/d  to  optimal  effect  in  patients  with  narcolepsy  for  up  to  6 months. Total daily dosages were 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5, or 9 g/d.

A total of 185 patients entered and 140 patients completed the trial. Other than having a history of cataplexy (i.e., &gt; 0), frequency of cataplexy was not specified by this protocol, and was not quantified at  baseline.  A  categorical  questionnaire  administered  at  baseline  (Visit  2),  indicated  that  in  the preceding week patients had experienced between 0 and 50 (or more) attacks per week.

At baseline the number of cataplexy attacks per week was none for 41 patients (23%), 1- 10 for 86 (48%), 11-25 for 35 (19%), 26-50 for 11 (6%) and more than 50 for 7 (4%).

The last  dose  of  sodium  oxybate  received  was  3  g  for  4  patients,  4.5  g  for  52  patients,  6  g  for  73 patients, 7.5 g for 27 patients and 9 g for 29 patients. The 9 g group was predominantly male (others were predominantly female) and also had higher mean weight and height suggesting that male, heavier and/or taller patients may require higher dosage.

## Long-term,  open-label,  extension  trial  of  Xyrem  (sodium  oxybate)  oral  solution  for  the treatment of narcolepsy.

OMC-SXB-7 was a long-term open label extension trial; patients who had participated in OMC-GHB3, OMC-SXB-6 or the Scharf (safety) study were eligible.

Efficacy has been summarised as the change from baseline to last observation on trial medication. The proportion of patients with no cataplexy attacks or with a significant decrease since the previous week was 77% overall and 100%, 100%, 70%, 69% and 87% for those taking 3 g, 4.5 g, 6 g, 7.5 g and 9 g, respectively.  Improvement  in  daytime  sleepiness  had  also  occurred  with  52%  overall  showing  no sleepiness or an improvement; the proportion showing improvement on 3 g, 4.5 g, 6 g, 7.5 g and 9 g were  100%,  38%,  49%,  50%  and  62%.  The  overall  proportions  with  improvement  in  inadvertent naps/sleep attacks (day), awakenings at night, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis episodes were 57%, 55%, 90% and 92%. Overall, 92% of patients regarded themselves as much improved or somewhat improved in overall narcolepsy symptom assessment.

## Open-label, multi-centre trial evaluating the effects of four doses of orally administered Xyrem (sodium oxybate) on overnight polysomnographic recordings

The primary objective of OMC-SXB-20 was to characterize the polysomnographic sleep architecture in narcoleptic patients at four escalating doses of sodium oxybate (4.5, 6, 7.5 and 9 g/day) over a 10week  exposure  period.  Daytime  function  was  also  assessed.  Safety  was  assessed  on  the  basis  of adverse events, clinical laboratory results, ECG, vital signs and physical examinations

The  following  conclusions  are  derived  from  the  objective  and  subjective  measures  of  daytime sleepiness:

·  The  administration of sodium oxybate produced a significant increase in daytime sleep latency as measured by the MWT. This dose-dependant increase averaged 3.7 minutes (p = 0.038) after 4 weeks of 4.5 g nightly that further increased to a mean improvement of 6.1 minutes (p &lt; 0.001) following the nightly 9.0 g dose.

This measured response is additive to that produced by concomitant stimulant dosing.

·  The presence of sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs) during MWT, which occurred in 18 of 21 patients (86%) at baseline, decreased to 13 of 21 (62%) following 4 weeks of 4.5 g sodium oxybate nightly. SOREMPs further decreased to 6 of 20 patients (30%) following the 9.0 g dose.

· The ESS  total score significantly decreased in a dose-dependant manner  by the nightly administration  of  sodium  oxybate.  The  median  total  score  of  20  at  baseline  improved  by  2  points following the 4.5 g dose regimen (p&lt;0.001), increasing across the dose range up to 7 points after the 9.0 g dose (p&lt;0.001).

The patients in the current trial reported substantial improvements in subjectively determined daytime narcolepsy symptoms including the incidence of cataplexy attacks, the number of inadvertent naps as well  as  decreased  daytime  sleepiness,  and  increased  the  ability  to  concentrate  and  a  perception  of overall improvement in their narcolepsy while taking nightly doses of sodium oxybate.

## 3.4.4 Discussion on clinical efficacy

Cataplexy is one of the hallmarks of narcolepsy although it is possible to have narcolepsy without the presence  of  cataplexy,  either  because  it  did  not  manifest  yet  or  because  the  clinical  situation  is  a variant  of  the  classical  narcolepsy.  At  a  given  moment  60  to  70%  of  the  patients  have  cataplexy attacks. Out of these only a fraction has cataplexy attacks that because of their frequency or severity need treatment. These patients are about 30% of all narcoleptic patients.

Narcolepsy  symptoms  are  categorised  in  2  families  those  that  are  REM  related,  meaning  that  they result  for  the  intrusion  of  REM  phenomena  in  a  disrupted  sleep/wakefulness  cycle.  The  REM phenomena  are  cataplexy,  hypnagogic  hallucinations  and  sleep  paralysis.  The  other  family  of symptoms  are  related  with  excessive  daytime  sleepiness.  Nevertheless  these  2  families  are  not completely independent and it is likely that improvement in one of them will reflect in a benefit in the other. However it is possible to produce an independent effect which is the case of modafinil that have a  beneficial  effect  in  daytime  sleepiness  without  affecting  cataplexy.  Thus,  efficacy  must  be demonstrated either for cataplexy or daytime sleepiness or for both.

In the case of GHB the applicant aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of GHB on cataplexy, although daytime sleepiness was also evaluated.

No dose-finding studies were conducted but the pivotal trial tested 3 doses (3, 6 and 9g/day).

There are 2 phase II trials (placebo controlled, crossover) which were of investigators initiative. One was GCP compliant the other not. In addition, there was a pivotal parallel, placebo-controlled trial. In these trials the duration of the double-blind treatment was not longer than 4 weeks. In the pivotal trial and one of the phase II trials patients had about 20 cataplexy attacks/week at baseline, in the other phase II trial patient were much less affected - 5 attacks/week. All patients were older than 16, and most of them older than 18 years old. In these conditions GHB reduced consistently the number of cataplexy attacks. This reduction was translated in a global improvement only in the high dosage of the pivotal trial. The open-label trials and extension of trials that are present in the dossier are also supportive of an effect in the number of cataplexy attacks. They also suggest that the positive effect of GHB is built up during time which makes 4 weeks a short time frame to assess the overall effect.

In  conclusion  GHB  is  efficacious  in  reducing  cataplexy  attacks.  The  9g  dose  is  clearly  the  most efficacious dose (the only dose that produces also a consistent effect in other symptoms) but this extra efficacy is at cost of more side-effects. The current recommended posology is starting at 4.5 g/day and going upwards according to efficacy and tolerability although such a regimen has not been studied in a randomised controlled trial. The effect on cataplexy seems to be maintained during several years but the  proof  of  this  is  not  very  robust  because  it  is  based  on  the  open-label  trials  and  in  the  relapse prevention trial. This suggests that in fact, the effect is maintained, but is confounded by an imbalance of severity at baseline between placebo and active group and by putative withdrawal effects.

The  data  available  is  consistent  with  the  existence  of  a  mild  withdrawal  syndrome  and  rebound cataplexy upon suspension of treatment. This is reflected in the SPC

In addition to the effect in cataplexy, GHB seems to have a positive effect on daytime sleepiness when the higher doses are used (9 g in the OMC-GHB-2 trial) and in the long-term (open label extensions). Usually  the  effect  on  daytime  sleepiness  is  paired  with  less  inadvertent  naps/sleep  attacks  and  less awakenings during the night which are probably related to the increase in slow wave sleep seen in the polysomnograms. The data that supports an effect on daytime sleepiness is not as strong than the one on cataplexy. Therefore the effect on daytime sleepiness is not considered to be demonstrated.

The populations studied do not include patients below 16 years of age, and the strata between 16 and 18 years old is very small. Although the disease starts at adolescence, mainly with excessive daytime sleepiness, the cataplexy attacks, affecting a fraction of the patients, occur on average 6 year from the onset of the other symptoms. Therefore, the indication has been limited to adults and this is reflected in the SPC.

## 3.5 Clinical safety

Safety data were collected in all clinical studies included in this application.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Analyses of adverse events in phase I (clinical pharmacology) studies, one additional study (OMCSXB-24)  is  included,  but  one  study  OMC-GHB-4  is  excluded.  The  latter  study  included  only  six patients who were part of the main Scharf study and none of them experienced any adverse events.

The  Scharf  study  is  a  long-term,  open-label,  retrospective  compilation  of  safety  data  from  143 narcoleptic patients treated with sodium oxybate for up to nearly 16 years under an investigator-held IND.  The  majority  of  the  patients  were  treated  at  doses  in  the  range  established  by  previous investigators (3 g to 9 g) with most patients experiencing optimal benefit at doses of approximately 6 g (Scharf et al, 1985).

There is also a retrospective study- the Scharf study- that only contributes with safety data and which was not described in the efficacy section.

## 3.5.1 Patient exposure

In total, 421 patients were treated with sodium oxybate for mean/median 219.7/174 days.

In total, 81 patients received placebo. Of those, three patients received placebo only, as the others in the  placebo-controlled  trial  (Scrima)  crossed  over  to  sodium  oxybate  treatment  (or  vice  versa),  or entered studies in which they received sodium oxybate after receiving placebo in OMC-GHB-2. All placebo-treated patients in OMC-SXB-21 had previously received sodium oxybate treatment.

The number of patients for whom data from clinical efficacy and safety studies have been analysed in MedDRA, is shown in the following table.

The majority of subjects were prescribed sodium oxybate at doses below 9 g/d. In study OMC-SXB-6, over  two-thirds  of  subjects  received  4.5  or  6  g/d  as  the  last  dose;  in  the  Scharf  study,  over  threequarters of subjects took the 4.5 or 6 g/d dose for the longest duration; in study OMC-GHB-3, just under 50% of subjects received an average dose of 4.5 or 6 g/d. This is summurised in the following table:

Note 1: in study OMC-SXB-6, of the 4 subjects on 3 g sodium oxybate (last dose). 3 had their dose decreased (from 4.5 g) for AEs, but did not report improvement of their cataplexy attacks at the 3 g dose. One subject had two reports of no attacks in the past week and one report of a significant increase on the 3 g dose. This subject had had his dose of SSRI decreased.

Note 2: in study OMC-GHB-3, it is not possible to interpret the effects of a 3 g sodium oxybate dose because the dose was frequently modified and the reason for changes in dose were not recorded systematically page 45, CSR Scharf study; Appendix 44a-6: Table 6. page 87, CSR OMC-GHB-3.

Source; Table 2.7.4.2.1 and 2.7.4.3.1 and Tables 6 a and 21 (Clinical) in Module 5.3.5.3.2 (Studies OMC-GHB-2, OMC-GHB-3,OMC-SXB-6,OMC-SXB-7, OMC-SXB-20. OMC-SXB-21 and the Scrima study)

The results (shown for all events combined, irrespective of relationship to treatment) were, in general, good agreement with those from all integrated studies. The most common events in sodium oxybatetreated patients that were observed in a higher proportion of sodium oxybate-treated patients, when compared to placebo, were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache and enuresis. However, many more events were recorded for a low percentage of sodium oxybate-treated patients and for none or just one placebo  treated  patient.  These  included  sleep  paralysis,  abnormal  dreams,  nightmares  and  sleep disorder. Blurred vision is also listed as a common side effect for which a possible pharmacodynamic is not proven.

## 3.5.3 Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

The only studies in which there were any deaths were the long-term Scharf study and study OMCSXB-7 (a  long-term,  open  extension  of  OMC-GHB-3,  OMC-SXB-6  and  the  Scharf  study).  Eleven deaths (7.7 %) were reported in the Scharf study. None of the deaths was considered related to sodium oxybate.

Two  deaths  have  been  reported  in  study  OMC-SXB-7,  both  of  which  were  suicides.  One  suicide (patient  0531,  coded  as  death)  was  due  to  multiple  drug  toxicity  that  included  toxic  levels  of  six psychotropic drugs other than sodium oxybate. The second suicide (patient 0936) was a patient with a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

history  of  depression  and  a  subsequent  suggested  diagnosis  of  bipolar  disease.  This  event  was officially ruled as a death due to cardiovascular disease (without autopsy by the Medical Examiner) but later evidence pointed to a possible overdose that included lithium, Paxil, and Percocet as well as sodium oxybate.

## 3.5.4 Laboratory findings

None of the laboratory changes raises a concern.

## 3.5.5 Safety in special populations and drug abuse

GHB is a known drug of misuse producing purported euphoric and/or hallucinogenic states.

The clinical trials and post-marketing data for Sodium oxybate have not revealed any clear evidence of abuse in patients.

It  should also be noted that 2,021 patients have registered for Xyrem use since US approval in July 2002, and there have been no premature refill requests or reports of theft or loss. However in Europe a risk management system as strictly controlled as in the US will not be possible.

## 3.5.6 Withdrawal and rebound

Literature reports (Friedman et al, 1996, Galloway et al, 1997) indicate that abrupt discontinuation of high-dose chronic sodium oxybate results in withdrawal symptoms including insomnia, anxiety, and tremors.  Of  these,  insomnia,  which  generally  resolved  within  3  days,  was  the  most  consistently described symptom, even in less heavy sodium oxybate users. Hallucinations have also been reported (Hernandez et al, 1998).

In study OMC-SXB-21, the incidences of subjects reported to have AEs, related AEs or severe AEs were higher in the group switched to placebo when compared to the group that continued with sodium oxybate therapy in the final 2-week double-blind treatment period, but these differences were small.

Five of the individual AEs might represent possible symptoms of sodium oxybate withdrawal. These were reported only in subjects in the placebo group: anxiety (n=2; 7%), dizziness (n=1; 3%), insomnia (n=1; 3%), sleep disorder (n=1; 3%) and somnolence (n=1; 3%).

Although  these  symptoms  might  have  represented  possible  symptoms  of  mild  sodium  oxybate withdrawal, they may also be consistent with the recurrence of symptoms of narcolepsy.

In  study  OMC-GHB-2,  during  the  3-5  day  follow-up  period  following  discontinuation  of  sodium oxybate, in each dose group (sodium oxybate 3 g/d, 6 g/d, 9 g/d and placebo), with the exception of headache (n=2 in the groups who had received sodium oxybate 6 g/d or 9 g/d) and pain (n=2 in the group who had received sodium oxybate 9 g/d), only one subject was reported to have each of the individual AEs.

Overall, although the data do not show clear evidence of a withdrawal syndrome, a mild withdrawal syndrome cannot be excluded. This is reflected in the SPC (section 4.4. and 4.8) Rebound reactions have been addressed in the clinical efficacy section of this report.

## 3.5.7 Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

There are no analyses of safety by concomitant treatments. Potential drug interactions with zolpidem, protriptyline, modafinil and omeprazole were analysed in Phase I studies (OMC-SXB-12, OMC-SXB14, OMC-SXB-17 and OMC-SXB-24, respectively).

## 3.5.8 Discontinuation due to adverse events

Thirty-five sodium oxybate-treated patients and one placebo-treated patient in the integrated clinical studies were withdrawn due to adverse events.

## 3.5.9 Post marketing experience

The commonly reported adverse events are consistent with those identified in clinical studies. No new safety issues have been identified when analysing the post marketing safety data for Xyrem.

## 3.5.10 Discussion on clinical safety

A major concern regarding the safety profile of sodium oxybate is the narrow safety margin between the efficacious dose and the toxic doses. The frequency of AEs increases with dose and this is clear at the dose of 9g/day. This dose level is very close to the toxic doses taking as shown by 3 cases that suffered either from impaired consciousness or respiratory depression at doses that were 2x or 3X the recommended dose given as a single administration.

Unfortunately,  the  clinical  studies  did  not  attempt  to  characterize  dosing  on  a  per/kg  body  weight basis.  Therefore,  the  recommended  method  of  administration  is  to  initiate  treatment  with  a  starting dose  of  4.5 g/d,  divided  in  two,  and  going  up  according  to  efficacy  and  tolerability.  In  addition prescribers should be warned that in patients with concomitant sleep apnoea the benefit-risk of going above 6 g/d should be stringently evaluated.

Most  common  AEs  are  expected  (vomiting,  nausea,  dizziness,  sleep  disorders).Regarding  the occurrence of enuresis/incontinence, the mechanism is unknown, but as the phenomena is similar to 'enuresis nocturna' the release of inhibitory mechanism is a putative mechanism.

An  evaluation  of  the  most  likely  hormonal  changes  by  means  of  a  specific  study  is  planned  as  a follow-up measure.

The  risk for withdrawal  reactions is mild  and  will be further studied in a  post  marketing Pharmacovigilance study.

The abuse/misuse potential will be also closely monitored in a risk management strategy. In addition to the limitations inherent to the legal status of GHB (schedule IV of the UN convention of 1971), the illicit use will be mitigated by means of education materials to health professionals and patients, strict control of distribution and non-interventional post-marketing surveillance

## 4 Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## 4.1 Quality

The  simple  synthesis  and  manufacture  of  the  product  are  described  and  controlled  in  a  relevant manner,  and  the  specifications  of  the  active  substance  and  medicinal  product  are  considered  to  be relevant for a product of this type. The stability of the product has been well-investigated, both in the unopened form, and with the adaptor and dosing system in place during use.

Satisfactory uniformity of dose has been demonstrated, and there are no unresolved quality issues that could have an impact on the benefit/risk balance for the patient.

## 4.2 Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The  precise  mechanism  by  which  sodium  oxybate  produces  an  effect  on  cataplexy  is  unknown. However, sodium oxybate is thought to act by promoting slow (delta) wave sleep and consolidating night-time sleep. The cause of human narcolepsy and cataplexy is, as yet, unknown. Recent evidence points  to  the  loss  of  hypocretin-containing  neurons,  possibly  due  to  autoimmune  attack,  as  a  likely cause.

In  addition  to  its  sedative  properties,  GHB  is  a  potent  CNS  depressant  and  may  increase  growth hormone secretion. The potential for acute respiratory depression after reintroduction of treatment in patients who might have developed tolerance is mentioned in the SPC (4.2) as well as a warning in case of concomitant administration with other CNS depressant, and especially alcohol. (SPC, 4.4 and 4.5)

The  interactions  resulting  from  the  stimulation  or  inhibition  of  GHB  dehydrogenase,  namely  with anticonvulsivant  drugs  and  L-dopa  are  considered  to  be  potentially  relevant  in  the  clinic  and  are mentioned in the SPC.(section 4.5 and 5.3).

The  bioavailability  in  rats  is  about  50-80%  and  the  clearance  is  rapid  (T½ ≈ 1h)  with  extensive biotransformation which  is not P450  dependant.  The  kinetic is non-linear, due  to saturable mechanisms of both absorption and elimination resulting in reduced Cmax and increased AUC from linearity with increasing doses. As GHB is metabolised by γ hydroxybutyrate (GHB) dehydrogenase, there  is  a  potential  interaction  with  drugs  that  inhibit  this  enzyme.  This  is  reflected  in  the  SPC (sections 4.5 and 5.3)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  repeat-dose  toxicity,  treatment-related  clinical  signs  were  mainly  related  to  sedation.  Safety margins, based on body weight changes and salivary gland atrophy, are low or non-existent, which is is in accordance with the frequent occurrence in humans of adverse effects such as nausea, anorexia and parasympathetic disorders (blurred vision, enuresis and sweating).

GHB is nongenotoxic and not considered to present a carcinogenic risk to humans.

In reproductive toxicity studies, foetoxicity was observed in rats and rabbits. The use of GHB is not recommended during pregnancy or breast-feeding and this is reflected in the SPC.

Tolerance to GHB as well as cross-tolerance to alcohol have been clearly demonstrated in rodents. The potential of GHB to induce withdrawal phenomena, demonstrated in animal models, is low, and the relevance for humans will be monitored in the future during the post-authorisation phase.

## 4.3 Efficacy

The clinical  programme  aimed  to  demonstrate  the  efficacy  of  GHB  on  cataplexy  although  daytime sleepiness was also evaluated.

No dose-finding studies were conducted but the pivotal trial tested 3 doses (3, 6 and 9g/day).

There are 2 phase II trials (placebo controlled, crossover) which were of investigators initiative. One was GCP compliant the other not. In addition, there was a pivotal parallel, placebo-controlled trial. In these trials the duration of the double-blind treatment was not longer than 4 weeks. In the pivotal trial and one of the phase II trials patients had about 20 cataplexy attacks/week at baseline, in the other phase II trial patient were much less affected - 5 attacks/week. All patients were older than 16, and most of them older than 18 years old. In these conditions GHB reduced consistently the number of cataplexy attacks. This reduction was translated in a global improvement only in the high dosage of the pivotal trial. The open-label trials and extension of trials that are present in the dossier are also supportive of an effect in the number of cataplexy attacks. They also suggest that the positive effect of GHB is built up during time which makes 4 weeks a short time frame to assess the overall effect.

In  conclusion  GHB  is  efficacious  in  reducing  cataplexy  attacks.  The  9g  dose  is  clearly  the  most efficacious dose (the only dose that produces also a consistent effect in other symptoms) but this extra efficacy  is  at  cost  of  more  side-effects.  The  current  recommended  posology  is  starting  at  4.5  g/day divided  in  two  intakes  and  going  upwards  according  to  efficacy  and  tolerability  although  such  a regimen has not been studied in a randomised controlled trial. The effect on cataplexy seems to be maintained during several years but the proof of this is not very robust because it is based on the openlabel trials and in the relapse prevention trial. This suggests that in fact, the effect is maintained, but is confounded by an imbalance of severity at baseline between placebo and active group and by putative withdrawal effects.

The  data  available  is  consistent  with  the  existence  of  a  mild  withdrawal  syndrome  and  rebound cataplexy upon suspension of treatment. This is reflected in the SPC

In addition to the effect in cataplexy, GHB seems to have a positive effect on daytime sleepiness when the higher doses are used (9 g in the OMC-GHB-2 trial) and in the long-term (open label extensions). Usually  the  effect  on  daytime  sleepiness  is  paired  with  less  inadvertent  naps/sleep  attacks  and  less awakenings during the night which are probably related to the increase in slow wave sleep seen in the polysomnograms. The data that supports an effect on daytime sleepiness is not as strong as the one on cataplexy. Therefore the effect on daytime sleepiness is not considered to be demonstrated.

The populations studied do not include patients below 16 years of age, and the strata between 16 and 18 years old is very small. Although the disease starts at adolescence, mainly with excessive daytime sleepiness, the cataplexy attacks, affecting a fraction of the patients, occur on average 6 year from the onset of the other symptoms. Therefore, the indication has been limited to adults and this is reflected in the SPC.

## 4.4 Safety

A major concern regarding the safety profile of sodium oxybate is the narrow safety margin between the efficacious dose and the toxic doses. The frequency of AEs increases with dose and this is clear at the dose of 9g/day. This dose level is very close to the toxic doses taking as shown by 3 cases that

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

suffered either from impaired consciousness or respiratory depression at doses that were 2x or 3X the recommended dose given as a single administration.

Unfortunately,  the  clinical  studies  did  not  attempt  the  characterize  dosing  on  a  per/kg  body  weight basis.  Therefore,  the  recommended  method  of  administration  is  to  initiate  treatment  with  a  starting dose  of  4.5 g/d,  divided  in  two,  and  going  up  according  to  efficacy  and  tolerability.  In  addition prescribers are warned that in patients with concomitant sleep apnoea the benefit-risk of going above 6 g/d should be stringently evaluated.

Most  common  AEs  are  expected  (vomiting,  nausea,  dizziness,  sleep  disorders).  Regarding  the occurrence of enuresis/incontinence, the mechanism is unknown, but as the phenomenon is similar to 'enuresis nocturna' the release of inhibitory mechanism is an hypothesis.

An  evaluation  of  the  most  likely  hormonal  changes  by  means  of  a  specific  study  is  planned  as  a follow-up measure.

The  risk for withdrawal  reactions is mild  and  will be further studied in a  post  marketing Pharmacovigilance study. The objectives of the study are to obtain data about patients' compliance to instructions  for  using  Xyrem,  to  monitor  the  adverse  drug  reactions  (ADRs)  and  estimate  their frequency, to obtain data on the potential of dependence, withdrawal syndrome, overdose, of Xyrem and to broaden the knowledge about adverse drug reactions in special populations; elderly, young.

The abuse/misuse potential will be also closely monitored in this post-marketing study as part of a risk management  strategy.  The  illicit  use  will  be  mitigated  by  means  of  education  materials  to  health professionals and  patients, strict control of distribution  and  non-interventional  post-marketing surveillance.

## 5 Benefit/risk assessment

The efficacy of sodium oxybate for reducing the number of cataplexy attacks in narcolepsy patients has been demonstrated.

The tolerability profile is good, but the potential toxic dose is close to the highest therapeutic dose of 9g/day and makes the adherence to a strict up-titration extremely important. Therefore the prescription is restricted to physicians with experience in sleep disorders.

Due to the well known potential of abuse of sodium oxybate, Xyrem is under special prescription.

Warnings and recommendations in order to use Xyrem are explained in the SPC, especially the dosing regimen (daily dose divided in two and not in fasting conditions), and several warnings in particular the risk of respiratory depression.

In addition, a post-marketing pharmacovigilance plan has been agreed in order to monitor closely the safety regarding the possible occurrence of respiratory depression, as well as the potential for rebound and withdrawal reactions. This Pharmacovigilance plan includes also a risk management programme in order to minimise the risks of misuse/abuse.

Overall, the benefit risk assessment of sodium oxybate is considered to be favourable.

## 6 Recommendation

'Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of  Xyrem  in  the  'treatment  of  cataplexy  in  adult  patients  with narcolepsy' was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation as a special and restricted prescription.
