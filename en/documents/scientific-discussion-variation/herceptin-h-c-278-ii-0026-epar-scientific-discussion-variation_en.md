## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Introduction

Trastuzumab is currently approved for the treatment of Her2 over-expressing metastatic breast cancer, either as monotherapy if therapy with anthracycline and taxanes has failed or is contraindicated, or in combination  with  paclitaxel  inpatients  who  have  not  received  prior  chemotherapy  for  metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable or in combination with docetaxel in patients who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

The  MAH  has  submitted  data  from  the  BO16348  (HERA)  trial  to  support  an  extension  of  the indication  to  include  adjuvant  treatment  of  patients  with  Her2  positive,  early  breast  cancer  after surgery and completion of chemotherapy.

## Clinical aspects

## Clinical pharmacology

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetics  of  trastuzumab  has  been  evaluated  in  patients  with  metastatic  breast  cancer previously.  Posology  in  metastatic  breast  cancer  is  a  loading  dose  of  4  mg/kg  followed  by  weekly infusion  at  a  dose  of  2  mg/kg.  Initially  pharmacokinetic  analysis  was  performed  using  a  onecompartmental model in phase I, II and III studies. This analysis gave a half-life estimate of 6-8 days which was included in the initial SPC. A reassessment using a two-compartmental model gave a halflife estimate of 28.5 days.

The BO16348 (HERA) trial contained a pharmacokinetic sub-study because of a different posology. Additional data using the same posology in the metastatic breast cancer setting have been submitted.

## Methods

Serum samples were assayed for trastuzumab concentration by a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The lower limit of quantification of the assay was 0.15 ng/mL.

Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived by model-independent methods. The principal parameters of interest from cycles 1 and 13 were Cmin, Cmax, tmax, AUC and Cl. The principal parameter of interest from cycle 18 was the terminal half-life (t½). Trough (pre-dose) concentrations from cycles 2, 3 and 13 were compared with those obtained previously from patients with metastatic breast cancer at the  same  time  points.  Data  from  metastatic  breast  cancer  studies  WO16229  and  BO15935  were combined and a graphical comparison with data from the HERA study was made.

Forty-four patients from the 1 year treatment group entered the PK substudy. Treatment consisted of a 8  mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg every three weeks. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis  were  collected  pre-dose  and  at  1.5,  2,  3,  4,  6,  8,  24,  96,  168  and  336  h  after  the  start  of infusion at cycles 1 and 13. In addition, a pre-dose sample was taken prior to dosing on day 1 of cycles 2, 3 and 14. On the day of administration of the final dose of Trastuzumab (cycle 18 at the end of year 1)  samples  were  collected  pre-dose  and  at  1.5,  2,  3,  4,  6,  8  and  24  hours  post-dose,  with  further samples taken on days 7, 14, 28 and 42 after the final Trastuzumab administration.

where EBC = Early Breast Cancer (current study) and MBC = Metastatic Breast Cancer (combined data from BO15935 and WO16229).

## Discussion on pharmacokinetics

A different posology has been chosen for the treatment of patients with early breast cancer. Instead of a  4  mg/kg loading dose and 2 mg/kg weekly dose an 8 mg/kg loading dose and a 6 mg/kg dose is administered  every  3  weeks.  The  results  from  the  ongoing  PK  study  are  preliminary,  in  particular population PK analyses will be performed after completion of the HERA study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Accumulation ratios, median trough concentrations and drug concentration profiles at week 13 and 18 indicate that steady state has been reached by week 13, the exact time-point prior to week 13 is not known. Accumulation ratios and median trough concentrations are similar to the results obtained in studies in patients with metastatic breast cancer using identical posology.

Half-life at cycle 18 was 16 days, calculated using a non-compartmental model. Although this is in disagreement to population PK analysis in the metastatic setting, these results should be regarded with caution because of low number of individuals (n=8). Final analysis is pending after completion of the HERA study.

No data comparing efficacy for the different posologies have been provided.

## Clinical efficacy

The MAH submitted data from one pivotal trial (HERA, BO16438) investigating trastuzumab in an adjuvant setting after completed chemotherapy and data from two studies investigating trastuzumab concurrent to adjuvant chemotherapy (NSABP B-31, NCCTG N9831).

## Main study HERA (BO16438)

HERA is a multi-centre, randomised, open label, parallel group study comparing observation to one or two years of treatment with trastuzumab. The study was conducted worldwide with the exception of the USA. Patients were enrolled at 462 centers in 39 countries.

Trastuzumab  treatment  consisted  of  an  8  mg/kg  loading  dose  and  a  6  mg/kg  dose  that  was administered every 3 weeks. Patients were randomised to either observation or Trastuzumab for one or two  years.  Concomitant  treatment  with  tamoxifen  or  anastrozole  was  allowed  according  to  centre practice.

In the case of cardiac toxicity a detailed algorithm was used to define discontinuation/continuation/stopping rules for trastuzumab (Figure 2). Dose modification for cardiac toxicity was not allowed.

Primary  objectives  were:  To  compare  disease-free  survival  in  patients  with  HER2  over-expressing breast cancer who have completed acceptable adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, if applicable, and who have been randomized to trastuzumab for one year versus no trastuzumab.

Secondary objectives were:

- -To  compare  overall  survival  in patients  randomized  to  no  trastuzumab  versus  one  year  of trastuzumab, and in patients randomized to no trastuzumab versus two years of trastuzumab.
- -To  compare  recurrence-free  survival  in  patients  randomized  to  no  trastuzumab  versus  one  year  of trastuzumab, and in patients randomized to no trastuzumab versus two years of trastuzumab.
- -To compare distant disease-free survival in patients randomized to no trastuzumab versus one year of trastuzumab, and in patients randomized to no trastuzumab versus two years of trastuzumab.
- -To evaluate safety and tolerability of trastuzumab.
- -To compare the incidence of cardiac dysfunction in patients treated and not treated with trastuzumab.

## · Primary endpoint

The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS) defined as the time from randomisation until the first event. An event was defined as any loco-regional or distant recurrence of breast cancer, the development of secondary primary cancer other than basal  or squamous carcinoma of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or death from any cause without documentation of one of these events. Lobular  carcinoma  in  situ  was  not  considered  an  event.  The  diagnosis  of  a  first  breast  cancer recurrence  could  be  made  only  when  both  clinical  and  laboratory  findings  met  criteria  for  locoregional or distant recurrence.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Secondary endpoints

Secondary  endpoints  included  overall  survival,  recurrence  free  survival  and  distant  disease-free survival.  Overall  survival  was  defined  from  time  of  randomisation  to  death  due  to  any  cause. Recurrence free survival was defined as the time from randomisation to the first local, regional and/or distant  tumour  recurrence.  Second  primary  cancers,  contralateral  breast  cancer,  and  deaths  without evidence of disease were treated as censoring events. Distant disease-free survival is defined as the time between randomisation and the date of the first distant tumour recurrence, second primary cancer, or contralateral breast cancer, whichever occured first. Local and regional recurrences were ignored for  calculating  distant  disease  free  survival.  Deaths  without  evidence  of  disease  were  treated  as censoring events.

## · Sample size

Sample size was calculated applying a (two-sided) Type I error of 0.025 and anticipating a 5 years disease free survival (DFS) rate of 65% in the observational arm, a 23% reduction in the risk of DFS following treatment with Trastuzumab and one interim analysis a total number of 951 events to be observed was calculated in order to achieve a power of 80% in a log-rank test. Assuming an annualized recruitment rate of 1992 patients per year over 2.25 years and a minimum follow-up period of 12 months this translates into a sample size of 1494 subjects per group (total: 4482).

## · Randomisation

Subjects were centrally randomized on a 1:1:1 basis (no Trastuzumab, 1 year Trastuzumab, 2 years Trastuzumab) using an interactive voice response system (IVRS). Randomization was stratified for the following factors:

## Nodal status

1. Any nodal status, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (nodal status unknown prior to chemotherapy)
2. No positive nodes, no neoadjuvant chemotherapy
3. 1-3 nodes positive, no neoadjuvant chemotherapy
4. &gt;4 nodes positive, no neoadjuvant chemotherapy Adjuvant chemotherapy regimen
1. no anthracyclines or taxanes
2. anthracyclines but no taxanes
3. anthracyclines + taxanes

Receptor status and endocrine therapy

1. negative
2. positive and no endocrine therapy
3. positive and endocrine therapy
1. &lt; 35 years
2. 35 - 49 years
3. 50 - 59 years
4. ≥ 60 years

Age

## Region

European, Nordic countries, Canada, Republic of South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, Asian/Pacific region and Japan, Eastern Europe ('CEE' countries including Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Russia and Slovakia), Central and South America

Randomization was done using the minimization technique to balance assignments across stratification groups (xx1).

## · Statistical methods

This study report deals with (partial) results of a pre-planned interim analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study protocol planned for one interim efficacy analysis after half (475) of the required 951 events had been observed. The aim of this interim analysis was to compare DFS for patients randomized to one  year  of  Trastuzumab  versus  no  Trastuzumab  and  two  years  of  Trastuzumab  versus  no Trastuzumab.  The  interim  analysis  was  performed  by  an  independent  statistician  and  the  results presented to the IDMC.

To account for the interim analysis an error-spending function of O'Brien-Fleming type was applied. The Bonferroni-Holm approach was used to account for the two comparisons vs. the observational arm. The significance levels for the most significant pair-wise comparison were 0.0010 for the interim analysis and 0.0247 for the final analysis assuring an overall significance level of 0.025 for the more significant pair-wise comparison. If significance was reached, the significance levels for the second pair-wise comparison were to be 0.0020 for the interim analysis and 0.0494 for the final analysis. The overall study-wide significance level for this procedure was 0.05.

The pairwise comparisons were made using an unstratified log-rank test. The time course of events was described by Kaplan-Meier curves and two year DFS rates including their 95% confidence limits were given for each treatment group. Risk ratios and 95% confidence limits were given for each pairwise comparison. As the IDMC disclosed data from the observation arm and the 1 year Trastuzumab arm (but not from the 2 years Trastuzumab arm), all data displays in this report are limited to two arms (observational arm and 1 year Trastuzumab).

Explorative subgroup analyses (e.g. for the stratification factors applied in treatment allocation) were performed to assess the consistency of results.

Similar methods as for DFS were used to analyse the secondary parameter overall survival (OS), recurrence free survival (RFS), distant disease free survival (DDFS), time to recurrence (TTR), and time to distant recurrence (TTDR).

All efficacy analyses in this report are based on the Full Analysis Set.

## RESULTS

The trial  was  started  on  30.11.2001  and  is  still  ongoing.  Recruitment  was  complete  in  March  2005 with 5090 patients enrolled. The planned interim analysis was performed after 3386 patients had been included in the trial, 1693 of these patients were randomised to the observation arm and 1693 were randomised to the 1 year trastuzumab arm. 475 events had been recorded at this point. Disposition of patients is shown in the following flow diagram.

## Prior and concomitant treatment

All  patients  had  surgical  treatment,  approximately  one  half  had  breast  conserving  surgery  and  the other half had mastectomy. More than 95% in both groups had resection of axillary nodes and about half  had  adjuvant  endocrine  therapy  (tamoxifen,  aromatase  inhibitors,  LHRH-agonists,  ovarian ablation  and  combinations  thereof).  94%  of  patients  in  both  groups  had  received  anthracyclinecontaining chemotherapy regimen. A summary of adjuvant chemotherapy is table 8.

## Efficacy Results

The primary endpoint of the HERA study is DFS. At the time of interim analysis 219 patients in the observation arm and 127 patients in the trastuzumab arm had an event defined as any recurrence of breast cancer, contralateral breast cancer, second non-breast malignancy or death from any cause (logrank test p&lt;0.0001). The mean duration of follow-up was 12.4 months for the observation group and 12.7 months for the trastuzumab group. Analysis survival by Kaplan-Meier curve (FAS population) is shown in the following figure. The hazard ratio is 0.54 (95% confidence interval 0.44-0.67). The 2year disease-free survival rate is 78.2% in the observation group and 85.8% in the trastuzumab group.

## Secondary efficacy parameters

## Overall survival

At  the  time  of  interim  analysis  40  (2.4%)  patients  in  the  observation  arm  compared  to  31  (1.8%) patients in the trastuzumab arm had died. A Kaplan-Meier plot for overall survival is shown in the following figure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Fig 5:

<!-- image -->

## Recurrence free survival

At the time of interim analysis 208 (12.3%) patients in the observation arm compared to 113 (6.7%) patients  in  the  trastuzumab  arm  had  a  relapse  of  disease  (local,  regional  or  distant).  This  result  is statistically significant (log-rank test p&lt;0.0001). The hazard ratio was 0.51 (95% CI 0.40-0.64).

## Distant disease-free survival

At the time of interim analysis 184 (10.9%) patients in the observation arm compared to 99 (5.8%) patients  in  the  trastuzumab  arm  had  a  distant  recurrence  of  disease.  This  result  is  statistically significant (log-rank test p&lt;0.0001). The hazard ratio was 0.50 (95% CI 0.39-0.64).

## SUPPORTIVE STUDIES

Two additional studies are provided to support the claim for treatment in early breast cancer. NSABP B-31  and  NCCTG  N9831  are  two  randomised  phase  III  studies  comparing  adjuvant  chemotherapy with  doxorubicin  and  cyclophosphamide  followed  by  paclitaxel  with  and  without  trastuzumab  in patients  with  HER2  positive  breast  cancer.  Both  studies  were  independently  planned  but  of  similar design. Therefore a joint interim analysis was performed

## Methods

Study  B-31  enrolled  women  with  HER2-positive,  early-stage,  node-positive  breast  cancer.  Study N9831 enrolled women with early-stage breast cancer who were at high risk of recurrence.

Important inclusion criteria for both studies were:

- -Pathologic  diagnosis  of  adenocarcinoma  of  the  breast  with  strongly  positive  (3  +)  HER2  protein overexpression or HER2 gene amplification
- -Histologically  confirmed  node-positive  disease  or  (Study  N9831  only  following  the  May  2003 amendment) high-risk node-negative disease (defined as tumour size &gt; 1 cm and oestrogen receptor [ER] and progesterone receptor [PR] negative, or tumour size &gt; 2 cm regardless of hormone receptor status)
- -Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than or equal to the lower limit of normal for the local radiological facility
- -Complete resection of the primary breast tumour and axillary nodal dissection (sentinel node biopsy alone, if negative, was allowed on Study N9831)
- -84 days (12 weeks) between surgery and randomization

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Both  studies  were  conducted  primarily  in  the  USA,  smaller  numbers  of  patients  were  recruited  in Canada, Guam, Lithuania, Peru, South Africa, United States, and Puerto Rico.

## Treatments

Patients  received  four  3-week  cycles  of  doxorubicin  (60  mg/m²)/cyclophosphamide  (600  mg/m²) followed by paclitaxel (weekly 80 mg/m²or three-weekly 175 mg/m²) for 12 weeks.

Patients randomized to Arm 2 of Study B-31 or Arm C of Study N9831 began trastuzumab therapy concurrently with paclitaxel. The total duration of trastuzumab therapy was 52 weeks.

The trastuzumab loading dose was 4 mg/kg and the weekly dose was 2 mg/kg.

- Objectives

Primary  objective  for  the  planned  joint  interim  analysis  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  weekly trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (four cycles of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by 12 weeks of paclitaxel [weekly or every-3-week administration] plus weekly trastuzumab) versus chemotherapy alone as adjuvant therapy for women with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer as measured by disease-free survival.

Co-primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  safety  of  combined  therapy  as  evidence  by  incidence  and severity of cardiac and non-cardiac events.

Secondary objective was to evaluate efficacy as measured by overall survival.

## · Sample size

The joint analysis of Studies B-31 and N9831 included patients from Arms 1 and 2 of Study B-31 and patients  from  Arms  A  and  C  of  Study  N9831.  The  joint  analysis  was  designed  to  detect  a  25% decrease  in  the  event  rate  for  DFS  (the  primary  endpoint)  and  overall  survival  (the  secondary endpoint). To achieve 90% power against this alternative and have an overall one-sided 0.025 level of significance,  710  events,  accumulated  across  both  trials,  were  required.  A  formal  plan  for  interim analyses of efficacy was incorporated into the description of the joint analysis of the two studies. This plan was documented before any efficacy evaluations were done in either study.

## · Efficacy

The primary efficacy endpoint of the joint analysis was DFS. At the time of the first scheduled interim analysis to evaluate efficacy, 394 patients had experienced a DFS event. Of these, 261 patients were in the chemotherapy alone arm and 133 patients were in the trastuzumab + chemotherapy arm. The pvalue for the hazard ratio crossed the prespecified early-reporting boundary of 0.001 (nominal 0.0005 one-sided) for DFS. As a result, the DMCs of both cooperative groups independently recommended closing the studies to accrual and offering trastuzumab to eligible patients in the chemotherapy alone arms.

| DFS rate at 4 years | 67.1% (95% CI: 62.5%, 71.7%) | 85.3% (95% CI: 82.4%, 88.3%) |

Interim  analysis  of  combined  data  showed  significantly  decreased  hazard  ratio  in  favour  of  the trastuzumab group. There is an increase in disease free survival in the trastuzumab group. At 3 years this translates to an absolute benefit with respect to disease free survival rate of 11.8% (95% CI:8.7%, 15.0%), at 4 years of 18.2% (95% CI: 14.4%, 22.1%).

## Discussion on Clinical Efficacy

The MAH has provided the results from one pivotal study (HERA) and two supportive studies (B13 and  N9831)  for  the  evaluation  of  safety  and  efficacy  of  trastuzumab  for  the  adjuvant  treatment  of HER2-positive, early breast cancer. The conduct of these studies is acceptable and no deviations from GCP are apparent.

In  these  trials  the  effect  of  chemotherapy  followed  by  a  one  year  treatment  with  trastuzumab  on disease recurrence and overall survival was examined. While HERA allowed a spectrum of currently used  adjuvant  chemotherapy  protocols,  B31  and  N9831  had  a  defined  chemotherapy  protocol consisting  of  cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin  and  paclitaxel.  However,  most  patients  in  the  HERA trial had received anthracyclines which is in line with current recommendations.

For the HERA trial the MAH has chosen a new posology, the loading dose has been increased from 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg and the maintenance dose from 2 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg, schedule has been changed from once weekly to once every three weeks. Both supportive studies have been performed using the approved posology. Efficacy data comparing both posologies directly are not available but the effect size in pivotal study and supportive studies is comparable.

Primary  objective  in  the  HERA  trial  and  in  the  joint  analysis  of  the  supportive  studies  was demonstration of efficacy as determined by disease-free survival. Primary endpoint was met in both analyses and a significantly reduced hazard ratio in favour of trastuzumab treatment was demonstrated (log-rank  p&lt;0.0001).  The  hazard  ratio  of  disease  free  survival  in  the  HERA  study  was  0.54  (95% confidence  interval  0.44-0.67).  The  2-year  disease-free  survival  rate  was  78.2%  in  the  observation group  and  85.8%  in  the  trastuzumab  group.  The  hazard  ratio  of  disease  free  survival  in  the  joint analysis of B-31 and N9831 study was 0.48 (95% confidence interval 0.39-0.59). The 3-year diseasefree survival rate was 75.4% (95% CI: 72.4%, 78.3%) in the observation group and 87.2% (95% CI: 85.0%, 89.4%) in the trastuzumab group.

There was no statistically significant effect on overall survival in the HERA trial yet, while the joint analysis of B-31 and N9831 showed a significantly reduced hazard ratio of 0.67 (95% CI 0.48-0.92) in favour of the trastuzumab treatment arm. Overall survival is significantly increased in the trastuzumab group although absolute benefit (difference in 4 year overall survival rate 4.8%, 95% CI 1.4-8.2) is considerably lower than for disease free survival.

Efficacy  was  demonstrated in  all  clinically  relevant  subgroups,  there  was  no  indication  that  certain subgroups do not have a benefit from treatment. External validity for efficacy is considered to be high, however, as discussed in the safety assessment in detail there is concern that inclusion and exclusion criteria  define a population with a considerably lower cardiac risk compared to patients that will be treated outside of strictly controlled trials.

Current data allow evaluating efficacy of one-year treatment only; data from the two year treatment arm have not been submitted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  conclusion  trastuzumab  is  effective  in  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  HER2-positive  breast  cancer  if given after adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy if appropriate. Efficacy has not been demonstrated in node-negative disease with a tumour-size of less than or equal to 1 cm, which is generally regarded as a low risk group for recurrence and thus was not included in the trial.

## Clinical safety

Analyses  presented  in  this  report  focus  on  the  comparison  of  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  1  year trastuzumab  arm  versus  observation  only  arm  based  on  a  protocol-specified  interim  analysis  of  the data performed after half of the required (951) events of disease free survival were recorded on the database (clinical cut-off March 29th 2005).

Secondary objectives of the trial with regard to the safety were

- To evaluate the safety and tolerability of trastuzumab.

- To compare the incidence of cardiac dysfunction.

Patients  entering  the  HERA  trial  were  required  to  have  an  LVEF  of ≥ 55%  at  baseline.  Cardiac monitoring was performed at weeks 13 and 25 and every 3 months thereafter and comprised ECG, echocardiogram or MUGA scan, clinical signs and symptoms of cardiac failure and completion of a cardiac questionnaire by the investigator. Trastuzumab treatment was discontinued in any patient who developed  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of  congestive  heart  failure.  In  addition,  an  algorithm  was provided  for  the  discontinuation  of  trastuzumab  in  individual  patients  based  on  interval  LVEF assessments, as described earlier (Figure 2).

Primary and secondary cardiac endpoints were defined and used in three pre-defined interim analyses of  cardiac  safety,  after  300,  600  and  900  patients  had  completed  6  months  from  randomization.  A significant LVEF drop was defined as an absolute decrease of at least 10 points below the baseline measurement and to below 50%.

## Primary Cardiac Endpoint

The occurrence in any patient at any time after randomization, but prior to the start of any new therapy for recurrent disease of any of the following:

- -Symptomatic congestive heart failure of NYHA class III or IV (confirmed by a cardiologist) and a drop in LVEF of at least 10 EF points from baseline and to below 50%.
- -Cardiac death defined as either:
- -Definite  cardiac  death:  due  to  CHF,  myocardial  infarction  or  documented  primary arrhythmia
- -Probable  cardiac  death:  sudden  unexpected  death  within  24  hrs  of  a  definite  or probable cardiac event (syncope, cardiac arrest, chest pain, infarction, arrhythmia etc.) without documented aetiology.

All primary cardiac endpoints, as defined above, were to be reported as serious adverse events (SAEs) irrespective of treatment allocation.

## Secondary Cardiac Endpoint

A secondary cardiac endpoint could occur any time after randomization, but prior to the start of any new therapy for recurrent disease, and was defined as:

- -A significant asymptomatic (NYHA class I) or mildly symptomatic (NYHA class II) drop in LVEF identified by MUGA scan or echocardiogram, unless the following  LVEF assessment indicated  a  return  to  levels  which  did  not  meet  the  definition  of  a  significant  LVEF  drop. NYHA class II CHF had to be confirmed by a cardiologist. A repeat assessment had to be performed  approximately  3  weeks  after  the  first  documented  LVEF  drop.  If  such  a  repeat assessment or confirmation of NYHA class II CHF by a cardiologist was not available, the Cardiac  Advisory  Board  (CAB)  was  to  review  the  case  to  determine  acceptability  as  a secondary cardiac endpoint. A significant LVEF drop was defined as an absolute decrease of at least 10 EF points below baseline and to below 50%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Events such as acute coronary syndrome, acute myocardial infarction or severe rhythm disturbances requiring treatment were not considered as primary or secondary cardiac endpoints unless fatal. These events were, however, reported as AEs or SAEs, as applicable.

The analyses were performed by an independent statistician and presented to the IDMC, who would have recommended stopping or modifying the trial if an absolute difference of more than 4% in the incidence  of  primary  cardiac  endpoints  was  observed  between  the  trastuzumab  and  observation groups.  The  IDMC  recommended  that  the  study  continued  as  planned  after  each  interim  analysis, implying that the difference remained below 4%.

## Adverse events

A total of 46% (792/1708) of patients in the observation arm and 70% (1179/1678) of patients in the trastuzumab  arm  experienced  at  least  one  adverse  event  during  the  study.  A  higher  percentage  of patients  in  the  trastuzumab  treatment  arm  (8.6%;  145/1678)  compared  with  the  observation  arm (4.6%;  79/1708) experienced at least  one  grade  III  adverse  event.  The  most  frequent  of  these  were hypertension, hot flush, vomiting, headache, diarrhoea and congestive cardiac failure. Ten observation arm patients and 13 trastuzumab arm patients experienced a Grade IV adverse event. Two grade IV adverse  events  (cardiac  failure,  congestive  cardiac  failure)  were  considered  related  to  trastuzumab treatment. In both cases, treatment with trastuzumab was discontinued and the events resolved without sequelae.

Arthralgia,  headache,  hot  flush,  nasopharyngitis  and  fatigue  were  each  reported  by  &gt;  10%  of  all patients. Not unexpectedly, adverse events occurring with a higher frequency in the trastuzumab arm than the observation arm included headache, nasopharyngitis, fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea, pyrexia and chills, all of which are commonly associated with trastuzumab infusions.

The vast majority of adverse events were classified as NCI-CTC grade 1 or 2 (2130/2251 events in the observation arm and 5046/5248 events in the trastuzumab arm). A total of 102 grade 3 adverse events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were reported by 79 patients (4.6%) in the observation arm, compared with 183 grade 3 adverse events in  145  patients  (8.6%)  recorded  during  treatment  with  trastuzumab.  Higher  frequencies  of  grade  3 infections  (including  influenza  and  acute  bronchitis),  general  disorders  and  administration  site conditions  (most  commonly  fatigue  and  chills)  and  gastrointestinal  disorders  (mainly  diarrhoea  and vomiting) were reported by patients in the trastuzumab group than in the observation arm.

Grade 4 (life-threatening) adverse events were reported by 10 patients (12 events) in the observation arm and 13 patients (14 events) in the trastuzumab arm, with no event occurring in more than one patient within each group.

During the study, 10 observation arm patients and 13 trastuzumab arm patients reported at least one adverse event that was considered life-threatening (grade IV) in intensity. No single grade IV adverse event occurred in more than one patient in each treatment arm. The 12 grade IV events reported in 10 patients  from  the  observation  arm  were  pain,  paresis,  hypotension,  pulmonary  embolism,  cardiac failure,  breast  cancer,  uterine  cancer,  breast  cancer  in  situ,  cervix  carcinoma,  pancreatic  carcinoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma and leukopenia. The 14 grade IV events reported in 13 patients from the trastuzumab arm were central line infection, appendicitis, catheter related complication, sudden death, cerebrovascular accident, cerebral ischemia, lymphoedema,  deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary hypertension,  depression,  congestive  cardiac  failure,  cardiac  failure,  breast  cancer  and  malignant melanoma. Two grade IV adverse events were considered related to trastuzumab treatment: Patient 31412/5416,  a  53-year-old  patient  reported  grade  IV  cardiac  failure  on  day  85  of  trastuzumab treatment which was reported as a serious adverse event. The cardiac failure was assessed as related to trastuzumab treatment. Patient 31289/1650, a 40-year-old patient reported grade IV congestive cardiac failure on day 155 of trastuzumab treatment. The event was reported as a serious adverse event and assessed  as related  to  trastuzumab  treatment.  In  both  cases,  treatment  with  trastuzumab  was discontinued and the events resolved without sequelae.

A total of 1276 adverse events reported by 600 patients in the trastuzumab arm were considered to be related to treatment. The most common treatment-related adverse events included known trastuzumab infusion reactions, such as chills, pyrexia and nausea, and known cardiac-related events, predominantly decreased ejection fraction and cardiac failure.

## Cardiac Safety

Primary cardiac endpoints (symptomatic CHF of NYHA class III or IV and a drop in LVEF to below 50% and at least 10 points below baseline, or cardiac death) were recorded by 1 patient (0.1%) in the observation arm (cardiac failure leading to death) and 10 patients (0.6%) in the trastuzumab arm (CHF of  NYHA  class  III  [8  patients]  or  class  IV  [2  patients],  no  deaths).  Secondary  cardiac  endpoints (asymptomatic-NYHA I or mildly symptomatic-NYHA II and decreases in LVEF of at least 10% of baseline value and below  50%)  were  recorded  by 9  patients  (0.5%)  in  the  observation  arm  and  51 patients (3.0%) in the trastuzumab arm.

Of  the  10  trastuzumab  patients  with  a  primary  cardiac  endpoint,  8  were  asymptomatic  at  the  last scheduled  assessment  on  the  database  (as  per  15th  December  2005).  Six  of  the  ten  patients  had  a recovery of the LVEF to at least 55% at a median of 121 days (36-409 days) from the initial LVEF drop. Nine of the 10 trastuzumab patients received treatment for congestive heart failure.

Of the 51 trastuzumab patients with a secondary cardiac endpoint, 45 (88%) were asymptomatic at the last scheduled assessment on the database (as per 15th December 2005). Thirty-five of the 51 patients (69%) had a recovery of the LVEF to at least 55% at a median of 189 days (13-831 days) from the initial  LVEF  drop.  Twelve  of  the  51  trastuzumab  patients  (24%)  have  been  reported  as  having received treatment for congestive heart failure.

All observation patients were asymptomatic at the last scheduled assessment on the database (as per 15th December 2005). Six of the 9 observation patients exhibited a recovery of the LVEF to at least 55% at a median of 204 days (139-274 days) from the initial LVEF drop. One of the 9 observation patients have been reported as having received treatment for congestive heart failure.

As  expected,  patients  treated  with  trastuzumab  had  a  higher  incidence  of  asymptomatic  cardiac dysfunction, defined as at least one drop in LVEF of ≥ 10 EF points from baseline and to &lt; 50% (7.4% of  patients  in  the  1  year  trastuzumab  arm  compared  with  2.3%  of  patients  in  the  observation  arm). Approximately  50%  of  trastuzumab  patients  who  had  an  initial  significant  LVEF  drop  were  later confirmed by a subsequent assessment to have a primary or secondary cardiac endpoint. The clinical significance of single, unconfirmed LVEF drops is unclear.

The majority of patients in the study (94% in each treatment arm) had received a previous treatment regimen  containing  anthracyclines.  All  11  patients  experiencing  a  primary  cardiac  endpoint  had received  previous  anthracycline  therapy and  all  but  2  of  the  60  patients  experiencing  a  secondary cardiac  endpoint  (both  of  whom  were  receiving  trastuzumab)  had  received  previous  anthracycline therapy.

The Applicant stated that the results regarding cardiac event compare favourably with rates of cardiac events from a pooled analysis of studies in patients with MBC, in which 2.7% of patients treated with trastuzumab experienced serious cardiac events and 10.2% of trastuzumab patients experienced a decrease in LVEF of ≥ 10% to below 50% .

In the majority of cases, LVEF values stabilized or returned towards baseline following cessation of trastuzumab treatment.

It is well known from the MBC setting that the risk of cardiotoxicity is higher in patients who receive anthracycline chemotherapy. In the HERA trial, 94% of all patients had previously been treated with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

chemotherapy  regimens  which  included  epirubicine  or  doxorubicine.  Each  of  the  10  trastuzumab patients experiencing primary cardiac endpoints (severe CHF, NYHA class III or IV), and all but two of  the  patients  who  recorded  secondary  cardiac  endpoints  (NYHA  class  I  or  II)  had  received anthracycline treatment before entering the study.

Slightly  higher  rates  of  cardiac  disorders  and  LVEF  drops  were  seen  in  the  other  large  EBC  trials. Assessment  of  cardiac  dysfunction  in  trial  B-31  showed  that  the  cumulative  incidence  of  cardiac events (CHF of NYHA class III or IV, or cardiac death) was 4.1% (31/850) for patients treated with trastuzumab  compared  with  0.8%  (5/814)  for  patients  in  the  control  group.  14%  of  patients discontinued  Trastuzumab  therapy  as  a  result  of  asymptomatic  decreases  in  LVEF  and  4% discontinued  because  of  symptomatic  cardiotoxicity.  As  seen  in  MBC  patients,  the  trastuzumabrelated cardiac dysfunction in this trial was generally reversible on cessation of treatment. The higher incidence in  this  study  may  be  related  to  the  concomitant  treatment  of  trastuzumab  with  paclitaxel. Recent data from the N9831 trial suggests that lower rates of severe cardiac disorder are seen when trastuzumab treatment is administered after completion of taxane therapy. The Applicant stated that the temporal proximity of trastuzumab treatment to AC chemotherapy may play a bigger role, based on  results  from  the  BCIRG-006  trial  where  symptomatic  cardiac  events  were  recorded  by  2.3%  of patients receiving trastuzumab concomitantly with docetaxel following AC therapy compared to 1.2% of patients in both the control group (AC → T) and the group of patients who received Trastuzumab in combination  with  docetaxel  and  carboplatin.  LVEF  decreases  (&gt;  15%  and  below  lower  limit  of normal) occurred in 2.4%, 0.6% and 0.4% of patients, respectively, in the AC → TH, AC → T and TCH groups.

The Applicant stated  that  the  rates  of  severe  CHF  seen  in  early  breast  cancer  are  lower  than  those observed in the metastatic setting. At the point of data cut-off in the HERA trial, rates of CHF, LVEF decreases  and  other  cardiac  disorders  were  lower  than  predicted  from  historical  data,  however,  the duration of follow-up is short (median 12 months) and the possibility that the rates may rise over time cannot be excluded. The current SmPC provides clear information on the risks of cardiac dysfunction associated  with  trastuzumab  therapy,  particularly  following  anthracycline-containing  chemotherapy. The  SmPC  also  outlines  recommended  cardiac  assessments  prior  to  prescribing  trastuzumab,  and provides  discontinuation  criteria.  The  same  precautions  should  be  followed  when  considering treatment in patients with early breast cancer.

## LVEF changes from baseline

At baseline, the median LVEF value was 64% in both treatment arms. The percentage of patients with significant  LVEF  drops  at  each  time  point  was  greater  in  the  1  year  trastuzumab  arm  than  in  the observation arm. Decreases in LVEF of ≥ 10% were recorded at some point during the study by 25% (394/1600)  of  patients  in  the  trastuzumab  arm  compared  with  14%  (213/1545)  of  patients  in  the observation  arm.  Significant  LVEF  drops  (i.e.  LVEF  value  &lt;  50%  and  a  decrease  of  &gt; 10%) were recorded  on  at  least  one  occasion  during  the  study  by  7.4%  (118/1600)  of  patients  treated  with trastuzumab compared with 2.3% (35/1545) of patients in the observation arm. Sixty-one of the 118 trastuzumab patients who had an initial significant LVEF drop were later confirmed by a subsequent assessment to have either a primary (10 patients) or secondary (51 patients) cardiac endpoint.

61 of the 118 trastuzumab patients who had an initial significant LVEF drop were later confirmed by a subsequent assessment to have a primary or secondary cardiac endpoint.

## Infusion Reactions

Common adverse events in patients treated with trastuzumab included those usually associated with infusions, namely pyrexia, chills, headache and nausea. The majority of these events were of mild or 2 days) and resolved without sequelae.

moderate intensity (NCI-CTC grade 1 or 2), short-lasting (app. There  was  no  evidence  of  an  increase  in  the  incidence  or  severity  of  infusion-associated  adverse events associated with the higher doses (6 mg/kg) used in the three-weekly regimen compared with the approved weekly dose of 2 mg/kg. Serious infusion-associated adverse events were reported by only eight patients in the study and resulted in the discontinuation of trastuzumab treatment in three of these patients.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

At the time of data cut-off, serious adverse events had been reported for 5% (92/1708) of patients in the observation arm compared with 8% (134/1678) of patients in the 1 year trastuzumab arm. Serious infections and infestations were reported by 36 (2%) patients in the trastuzumab arm compared with 16 (&lt; 1%) control patients, cardiac disorders were reported by 22 trastuzumab patients (1%) and 4 (&lt; 1%) observation arm patients and general disorders and administration site conditions were reported by 13 (&lt; 1%) trastuzumab arm patients compared with 2 (&lt; 1%) observation arm patients.

The  most  common,  treatment-related  serious  adverse  event  was  cardiac  failure,  reported  by  11 trastuzumab patients (preferred terms 'congestive cardiac failure' [7 patients] and 'cardiac failure'[4 patients])  vs.  no  observation  patients.  In  total,  30  patients  in  the  Trastuzumab  group  recorded  38 serious  adverse  events  that  were  considered  to  be  related  to  treatment,  most  commonly  congestive cardiac failure/cardiac failure (11 patients), chills (4 patients), pyrexia (3 patients) and hypotension (2 patients).

After  congestive  cardiac  failure,  the  next  most  frequently  reported  serious  adverse  events  were erysipelas  (reported  by  7  trastuzumab  patients  and  1  observation  patient),  central  line  infection  (6 trastuzumab  patients  and  1  observation  patient),  breast  fibrosis  (5  trastuzumab  patients  and  1 observation patient), cellulitis and deep vein thrombosis (each reported by 4 trastuzumab patients).

Ninety-seven patients were withdrawn from the study as a result of an adverse event. In 88 of these patients,  the  adverse  event  which  led  to  withdrawal  was  considered  to  be  related  to  trastuzumab treatment. 'Cardiac disorders' (SOC) accounted for discontinuation in 44 patients (3%), of whom 30 experienced congestive cardiac failure/cardiac failure. A  further 23 patients had  trastuzumab discontinued  due  to  ejection  fraction  decrease  (recorded  within  the  SOC  'Investigations').  Cardiac disorder and chills were each recorded as the reason for discontinuation by three patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At the time of the interim efficacy analysis, two patients in the observation arm and 4 patients in the trastuzumab arm had died as a result of an adverse event. In the observation arm, patient 31307/6503 committed suicide on study day 146 and patient 31508/2771 died on day 205 due to cardiac failure which  the  investigator  considered  to  be  probably  a  result  of  pulmonary  embolism.  Deaths  in  the trastuzumab arm resulted from cerebral haemorrhage (study day 115, patient 31216/7913), cerebrovascular accident (study day 289, patient 31218/3621), sudden death (study day 290, patient 31351/7392)  and  appendicitis  (study  day  366,  patient 31562/4095).  A  further  patient in the trastuzumab arm died as a result of a road accident, which was not reported as an AE.

In  addition,  disease  progression  of  the  underlying  breast  cancer  accounted  for  38  deaths  in  the observation arm and 26 deaths in the Trastuzumab arm.

In the B-31 and N9831 trials, some rare cases of interstitial pneumonitis were reported that appeared to  be  related  to  trastuzumab  therapy.  Four  patients  treated  with  trastuzumab  in  trial  B-31  had interstitial pneumonitis, one of whom died. In N9831, five patients in the trastuzumab arm had grade 3+ pneumonitis or pulmonary infiltrates, one of whom died. These occurred during or shortly after the paclitaxel  phase  of  treatment,  however,  the  relationship  to  paclitaxel  treatment  is  unclear.  In  the HERA trial, one patient in the trastuzumab group recorded pneumonitis during the study. The event was  considered  unrelated  to  treatment  by  the  investigator,  was  of  NCI-CTC  grade  2  and  resolved without sequelae following appropriate treatment.

## Laboratory findings

During the study the majority of patients in either study arm did not exhibit a shift from their baseline laboratory  test  parameter  values  or  exhibited  a  shift  of  2  grades  or  less  between  baseline  and  their worst test value. Fewer patients in the trastuzumab 1 year arm experienced a shift of 3 or 4 grades from baseline than in the observation arm.

A total of 31 observation arm patients and 21 patients in the 1 year trastuzumab arm experienced a 3grade  worsening)  from  baseline  in  one  or  more  laboratory  test  parameter  values  (40  events  and  24 events, respectively). Twenty-four  observation  arm  patients and  16  trastuzumab  arm  patients experienced a 4-grade worsening in one or more laboratory test parameters (30 events and 17 events, respectively). There was no difference between the treatment arms with respect to the type of 3grade or 4-grade shifts from baseline.

## Risk Management Plan

The applicant has submitted a risk management plan in accordance with the EC directive EC/27/2004. The plan details the steps to be taken post marketing authorisation in order to minimise the risks associated with the use of this agent.

The  submitted EU-RMP will be revised in accordance with CHMP comments and will be resubmitted by June 2006.

In view of the likelihood that cardiac failure will occur at higher rates in ordinary practice than in the HERA study, proposals for an observational study should be included. The RMP should incorporate a set of guidelines to ' initiate and monitor cardiac function/dysfunction associated with Herceptin use' in early breast cancer.

## Risk Minimisation

On the  basis  of  the  safety  profile  detailed  above,  it  is  considered  that  the  major  identified  risk  for trastuzumab  is  of  cardiotoxicity.  In  keeping  with  current  regulatory  guidelines,  and  in  order  to maximise the benefit/ risk ratio in the adjuvant setting this section, Roche proposes a risk minimisation plan.

The MAH amended the trastuzumab label, as per the HERA data, to emphasise the current warning regarding cardio toxicity. In addition to good pharmacovigilance practice, the following measures will be implemented

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discussion on clinical safety

Cardiotoxicity  is  a  known  risk  of  treatment  with  trastuzumab  and  described  in  the  SmPC  in  the metastatic  setting.  The  current  SPC  states  that  all  MBC  candidates  for  treatment  should  undergo baseline cardiac assessment including history and physical examination, ECG, echocardiogram and/or MUGA  scan,  and  a  careful  risk-benefit  assessment  conducted  prior  to  starting  treatment  with trastuzumab.  It  is  also  recommended  that  cardiac  function  be  monitored  regularly  (e.g.  every  three months) during treatment, and patients who develop asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction may benefit from  more  frequent  monitoring  (e.g.  every  6-8  weeks).  Discontinuation  of  treatment  should  be considered in patients who develop cardiac failure or who have a continued decrease in LVEF.

The major adverse event that could be a limiting factor for the use of Herceptin in breast cancer is the cardiac safety. Herceptin use in the metastatic breast cancer setting is associated with heart failure that varied in incidence depending up on the concomitant chemotherapy used. In the metastatic setting the incidence  of  cardiac  dysfunction  was  ~7%  when  used  as  monotherapy,  28%  combined  with anthracyclines,  and  11%  when  combined  with  paclitaxel.  Use  of  broader  criteria  has  led  to  newer events and redefinition of percentages.

In the 'early breast cancer' setting, the HERA trial provides the first clues towards the incidence of cardiac  dysfunction.  The  findings  of  other  studies  (B-31,  N9831  and  BCIRG-006),  support  the findings  but  in  a  slightly  different  context.  In  the  B-31  and  N9831  studies,  Herceptin  was  used  in conjuction  with  a  taxane  and  are  therefore  not  identical  to  the  HERA  trial.  However,  overall,  the incidence of heart failure or cardiac dysfunction is lower in this setting than that seen earlier with the metastatic setting.

The incidence of cardiac dysfunction in the HERA trial should taken as a composite of the primary and secondary end points. The long-term effects of drop in LV ejection fraction in this subset of other wise healthy patients will need to be addressed carefully. The 'investigators' cardiac questionnaire' showed a higher incidence of cardiac symptoms and clinical findings, suggesting that the 0.6% heart failure  incidence  projected  by  the  applicant  is  an  underestimate.  In  this  context,  it  is  considered appropriate to raise questions to the applicant.

Safety  data  have  been  reported  from  patients  who  have  been  treated  with  trastuzumab  in  the  three other  large  studies  of  trastuzumab  in  early  breast  cancer  (B-31,  N9831  and  BCRIG-006).  The  joint efficacy  analysis  of  trials  B-31  and  N9831  included  1672  women  in  the  trastuzumab  arm  (weekly Trastuzumab  treatment  given  concurrently  with  paclitaxel  following  4  cycles  of  doxorubicin  and cyclophosphamide).  In  study  BCIRG  006,  a  total  of  2147  patients  were  randomized  to  receive trastuzumab, either in combination with docetaxel following 4 cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (N=1074), or with docetaxel and carboplatin (N=1075). In these trials trastuzumab had been administered in combination with taxane in the adjuvant setting after administration of an anthracycline containing chemotherapy regimen. The definition of cardiac events for confirmation by a committee for evaluation of cardiac events were very strict, so that only 16 of 40 adverse events in the chemotherapy alone arm had been confirmed and only 43 of 133 events in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm. The joint analyses demonstrated 2.0% of confirmed symptomatic cardiac events in the  trastuzumab  plus  chemotherapy  arm  and  0.5%  in  the  chemotherapy  alone  group.  The  rate  of cardiac events determined by the cardiac review committee pooling the data of both studies was lower than  that  determined  by  the  individual  study  committees  of  both  studies.  The  worst  case  rate  of symptomatic cardiac events was 0.7% in the chemotherapy alone arm and 3.2% in the Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm and this rate was nearly similar in the study where trastuzumab had been coadministered  with  taxanes  of  0.7%  in  the  arm  without  trastuzumab  and  3.5%  for  the  trastuzumab

containing  regimen.  In  the  trastuzumab  plus  chemotherapy  arm,  3  patients  died  because  of  cardiac events and in the chemotherapy alone arm 2 patients died because of cardiac event

The primary and secondary cardiac endpoint defined by the MAH are very selected which may lead to an  underestimation  of  cardiac  toxicity  of  trastuzumab  in  EBC.  In  the  US  studies  the  definition  of cardiac dysfunction differed from those in the HERA study (less exclusive). The cardiac dysfunction was described in two ways:; cardiac events and asymptomatic LVEF events.

It is stated that the majority of primary and secondary cardiac endpoints were recorded during the first 6  months  post-randomization,  which  may  suggest  there  is  no  increase  in  the  risk  of  cardiac dysfunction with long term (1 year) treatment with trastuzumab. It remains to be seen whether a higher incidence  of  CHF  will  be  observed  with  longer  follow-up  and  following  2  years  treatment  with trastuzumab.

In  the  EBC  setting  all  patients  with  risk  factors  for  cardiotoxicity  were  excluded  from  study participation.  In  addition,  the  cumulative  dose  of  AC  was  limited  to  certain  thresholds.  This precautionary measure might explain the difference between the results of cardiac toxicity in the MBC and EBC setting. The different definitions of cardiac toxicity should also be taken into account.

Infusion reactions associated with trastuzumab treatment are well characterized, generally mild in intensity and are manageable by interruption of the dose and/or appropriate medical care. As demonstrated in the HERA trial, patients who experience mild infusion reactions in the early treatment cycles usually go on to receive subsequent infusions without problem. There are no additional concerns relating to infusion-associated adverse events in early breast cancer patients.

## Overall Conclusion and Benefit-risk assessment

The HERA trial has demonstrated an impressive level of efficacy for both primary and secondary end points  that  include  disease  free  survival,  recurrence  free  survival,  and  distant  disease  free  survival within the limited median follow up of 1 year. The reduction in relative risk is of the order of ~4550%, while the absolute risk reduction is ~5.4% for the primary end point. The hazard ratio of disease free survival in the HERA study was 0.54 (95% confidence interval 0.44-0.67, log-rank p&lt;0.0001). No benefit in overall survival was seen yet but this may require further follow up as the number of events were  few  and  the  overall  survival  in  early  breast  cancer  with  the  current  modalities  of  treatment exceeds  85%.  The  results  are  based  on  interim  analysis  only  and  the  2  year  arm  results  are  still awaited. The 2-year disease-free survival rate was 78.2% in the observation group and 85.8% in the trastuzumab group. The hazard ratio of disease free survival in the joint analysis of B-31 and N9831 study  was  0.48  (95%  confidence  interval  0.39-0.59,  log-rank  p&lt;0.0001).  The  3-year  disease-free survival rate was 75.4% in the observation group and 87.2% in the trastuzumab group. Efficacy results were consistent in clinically relevant subgroups.

There  was  no  statistically  significant  effect  on  overall  survival  in  the  HERA  trial,  while  the  joint analysis of B-31 and N9831 showed a significantly reduced hazard ratio of 0.67 (95% CI 0.48-0.92) in favour of the trastuzumab treatment arm. Since all patients in the observation arms were offered active treatment evaluation of overall treatment benefit in terms of overall survival may become difficult.

Herceptin is a rather well-known medicinal product, currently licensed in the metastatic disease. The safety profile is characterised in this setting, and a major known safety issue is cardiotoxicity. Therefore, already at this stage the consequences as regards risk management and other measures are clear-cut and can be defined at this stage.

Herceptin infusion was associated with a number of adverse events greater than the observation arm, especially cardiac dysfunction. The combined incidence of primary and secondary end points should be taken as the level of cardiac dysfunction induced by herceptin and at 3.6% this is considerable in this relatively healthy female population. The added degree of asymptomatic LV dysfunction that may or may not be truly reversible should be considered together with the cardiac safety end points. Only further  follow  up  will  address  this.  Other  adverse  events  with  Herceptin  are  well  known  and manageable.

As the used inclusion/exclusion criteria and the strict case definition of cardiac toxicity might lead to an underestimation of cardiac risk of the target population, the SPC wording reflects the real risk of cardiac toxicity in EBC.

Finally, there is no information available on the long-term effects of treatment with trastuzumab. The patients treated in an adjuvant setting have a considerably longer live expectancy than patients treated in  the  metastatic  setting.  In  the  case  of  recurrence  they  will  be  faced  with  the  additional,  possibly cardiotoxic  treatment.  In  addition  other  factors,  e.g.  relating  to  age  and  life-style  may  increase  the cardiac risk unproportionally. Further, patients might in case of a recurrence again be candidates for Herceptin treatment (which would resemble the setting of the currently licensed indication). The reexposure of Herceptin both as regards safety and efficacy is unknown, but could bear potential risks (immunogenicity, infusion reactions, reduced efficacy etc.). The long-term outcome of patients treated with trastuzumab should therefore examined in a postmarketing study.

The long-term impact of the new adjuvant treatment with Herceptin should be systematically studied. While there might be immediate benefit in terms of PFS, the long-term impact of treatment both in terms of safety and efficacy should be understood. While only hypothetically at the current stage of knowledge, it could turn out that patients relapsing following adjuvant treatment with Herceptin might not anymore be candidates for re-treatment with Herceptin (e.g. due to immunogenicity), negatively influencing  prognosis.  Further,  cardiotoxicity  could  negatively  impact  on  prognosis  and  long-term outcome. This needs to be studied adequately to better define the value of (neo-) adjuvant treatment with Herceptin.

In  view  of  the  outstanding  efficacy  seen  in  the  interim  analysis  of  the  1-year  Herceptin  arm  of  the HERA trial  and  the  supportive  studies  and  with  cardiac  safety  considerations  in  mind  the  overall benefit-risk of Herceptin in the adjurant treatment of Breast Cancer patients overexpressing HER-2 is considered positive. Data from the interim analysis of the 2-year trastuzumab arm will be submitted when available.
