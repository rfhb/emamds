## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for anagrelide, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

During  the  reporting  period,  nine  new  cases  were  retrieved  through  the  search  with  the  SMQ  for pulmonary hypertension, all serious. Pulmonary hypertension is part of the known safety profile for anagrelide, currently listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC as a 'rare' adverse reaction.

Based on the updated total of 35 cases of pulmonary hypertension retrieved from the clinical trials cumulatively, all assessed as unrelated to the underlying treated disease of essential thrombocythaemia, the reporting frequency for pulmonary hypertension from evaluable clinical trials was  recalculated  as  35/5578  =  0.0063  (0.63%),  which  corresponds  to  an  'uncommon'  event. Considering  the  nine  new  cases  suggesting  a  causal  relationship  with  anagrelide  together  with  the recalculated  reporting  frequency,  a  change  in  frequency  from  'rare'  to  'uncommon'  is  considered appropriate. The change should be implemented accordingly in the package leaflet.

Moreover,  these  new  cases  and  the  higher  frequency  of  occurrence  also  raise  the  need  for  further information to be provided in section 4.4 of the SmPC, in order to alert healthcare professionals to this serious  adverse  reaction  and  the  need  for  close  monitoring  of  the  patients  for  any  symptom  of pulmonary hypertension, including in patients with a medical history of pulmonary hypertension. The package leaflet should be updated accordingly.

As Xagrid and Thromboreductin contain the same active substance, with similar therapeutic schemes, the safety profile for this risk is expected to be similar, despite lower reporting with Thromboreductin and the PRAC therefore considered that the changes to the product information should be implemented for both products.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for anagrelide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing anagrelide is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
