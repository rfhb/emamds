## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

## Prostate Cancer

Prostate cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality for men in the industrialised world. It increases  steadily  with  age  and  the  median  age  at  diagnosis  is  slightly  above  70  years.  Worldwide more than 670,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year and the number of new cases is rising due to increasing life expectancy. In 2006 in Europe there were 345,900 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed.  The  2007  estimate  of  new  cases  in  the  USA  was  218,890  with  27,050  deaths.  The incidence varies widely between ethnic groups, regions and countries, with the highest rates in USA African-Americans and the lowest in Asian males.

Long-term disease-free intervals are commonly associated with surgical or radiotherapeutic treatment in more than 60% of subjects with localized disease (stages I and II). In contrast, such outcomes are uncommon for subjects with loco-regional (stage III) or distant (stage IV) disease.

Hormonal manipulations, such as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists) or surgical  castration  are  effective  for  90%  of  subjects  with  loco-regional  or  distant  disease.  Antiandrogens are commonly used during the first weeks of GnRH agonist therapy in order to prevent the sequelae of an initial and temporary rise in serum testosterone (flare up effect).

## The Medicinal Product

Degarelix, a third generation GnRH receptor antagonist (a GnRH blocker), has been developed as a new  therapy  for  prostate  cancer  patients  in  need  of  androgen  ablation  therapy.  The  aim  of  the degarelix development has been to achieve testosterone suppression in the same range as for GnRH agonist therapy without any increase in testosterone levels after the initial dose.

Degarelix binds to GnRH receptors in the anterior pituitary gland resulting in a decreased secretion of LH and FSH, and subsequently decreased production of testosterone by the Leydig cells in the testes. Testosterone  suppression is  achieved  almost  immediately  after  s.c.  administration  of  degarelix.  The degree and duration of testosterone suppression are related to plasma concentrations of degarelix. The formation  of  a  depot  following  s.c.  administration  gives  rise  to  sustained  plasma  concentrations  of degarelix, resulting in prolonged GnRH receptor-mediated suppression of testosterone levels.

The claimed indication for Degarelix was initially 'treatment of patients with prostate cancer in whom androgen  deprivation  is  warranted,  including  patients  with  rising  PSA  after  having  undergone prostatectomy or radiotherapy'. However, the approved indication is treatment of advanced hormonedependent prostate cancer. A dosing regimen consisting of a starting dose of 240 mg, followed by a monthly maintenance dose of 80 mg throughout the 12-month treatment period, has been proposed. The aim of the clinical study program has been to develop a safe and efficacious one-month dosing regimen,  which  achieves  testosterone  suppression  in  the  same  range  as  for  GnRH  agonist  therapy without any increase in testosterone levels after the initial dose. As of the submission database cut-off date  (September  28,  2007),  16  clinical  safety  and  efficacy  studies  of  degarelix  in  prostate  cancer patients,  including  seven  extension  studies,  were  completed  or  are  ongoing.  Of  these,  11  clinical studies  were  completed.  Five  studies  (4  extension  studies  and  one  3-month  dosing  regimen  main study)  are  ongoing  and  safety  data,  as  of  the  database  cut-off  date  for  these  ongoing  studies,  were integrated for analysis.

The  applicant  requested  scientific  advice  (article  57(1)(n)  of  Regulation  (EC)  726/2004  )  from  the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) on 21 June 2004. Advice was sought primarily on the proposed Phase 3 clinical study program (originally two studies were planned), the anticipated safety database, and specific monitoring of hepatic liver enzymes and allergic reactions.

No pediatric development programme has been carried for this medical product since this is a nonexiting indication in the paediatric population.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

FIRMAGON is presented as powder and solvent for solution for injection, containing 80 mg or 120 mg of degarelix (active substance) and is intended for subcutaneous use. The sterile powder is a freezedried  product  containing  degarelix  (as  acetate)  and  mannitol.  The  solvent  consists  of  sterile  water  for injection.

Powder is a white to off-white and the solvent is a clear, colourless solution. After reconstitution drug product forms a clear solution.

After administration, in contact with body fluids such as plasma, degarelix spontaneously forms a gel (naturally forming prolong-release form). The gelling process is mainly influenced by the concentration of degarelix, time, temperature, salt content and proteins (mannitol has no functionality for  gel  formation).  Therefore,  while  the  process  does  not  take  place  visibly  in  the  reconstituted suspension,  the  depot-formation  occurs  instantaneously  following  subcutaneous  administration.  The natural depot formation after subcutaneous administration results in sustained release of degarelix and a prolonged duration of pharmacological effect.

The powder is supplied in glass vials with bromobutyl rubber stoppers. The solvent is supplied in glass vials with chlorobutyl rubber stoppers with silicate filler.

## Active Substance

Degarelix (INN), which is  a  third  generation  gonadotropin  releasing  hormone  (GnRH) antagonist (blocker), is a synthetic linear decapeptide containing seven unnatural amino acids, five of which are D-amino acids.

The  drug  substance  is  chemically  designated  as  D-Alaninamide, N -acetyl-3-(2-naphthalenyl)-Dalanyl-4-chloro-D-phenylalanyl-3-(3-pyridinyl)-D-alanyl-L-seryl-4-[[[(4 S )-hexahydro-2,6-dioxo-4pyrimidinyl]carbonyl]amino]-L-phenylalanyl-4-[(aminocarbonyl)amino]-D-phenylalanyl-L-leucylN 6-(1-methylethyl)-L-lysyl-L-prolyl-.

Its common names is: [Ac-D-2Nal 1 ,  D-4Cpa 2 ,  D-3Pal 3 ,  4Aph(L-Hor) 5 ,  D-4Aph(Cbm) 6 ,  Lys(iPr) 8 ,  DAla 10 ] GnRH

where:  2Nal  is  2-Naphthylalanine,  4Cpa  is  4-Chlorophenylalanine,  3Pal  is  3-Pyridylalanine,  Hor  is hydroorotyl, Lys(iPr) is N 6-Isopropyllysine,  4Aph  is  4-Aminophenylalanine,  and  Cbm  is  the carbamoyl group.

Degarelix consists of ten chiral centers in the back bone of the molecule. The amino acid residue at position 5 in the sequence has an additional chiral center in the side-chain substitution giving eleven chiral centers in total. The N-terminal is acetylated. The C-terminal Ala 10 is present as its amide. It has an  empirical  formula  of  C82H103N18O16Cl  and  a  molecular  weight  of  1632.3  Da,  and  the  following structure:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

Degarelix is a white to off-white amorphous powder of low density. It is obtained as the acetate salt in the form of a lyophilised powder after the final purification step. It is soluble in water and in aqueous solution containing mannitol. However, in concentrations ranging 0.1 - 10 mg/ml the solution tends to become turbid and forms gel after several hours or days, depending on concentration and temperature. The phenomenon is explained by the self-aggregation propensity of the drug substance.

Experimental  pKa  values  for  degarelix  are  10.8  (side-chain  of  Lys(iPr))  and  4.4  (side-chain  of  D3Pal). Specific optical rotation (in 30 % acetic acid) is - 39° ± 1.

Degarelix is hygroscopic. Water is unspecifically bound to degarelix drug substance, and not present as crystal water.

##  Manufacture

Degarelix is synthesised in a liquid phase peptide synthesis (LPPS) process. A detailed description of the manufacturing process, including process flow diagram and in-process controls was provided.

Initially  degarelix  was  synthesised  via  solid  phase  peptide  synthesis  (SPPS).  The  SPPS  route  was employed for the majority of the batches used in pre-clinical and some clinical studies. However, with the  SPPS  route  the  production  capacity  was  limited,  and  later  on,  when  more  drug  substance  was required,  the  larger  scale  LPPS  process  was  developed.  For  the  LPPS  route  also  a  more  efficient purification procedure can applied.

Adequate  tests  have  been  performed  to  provide  evidence  on  the  chemical  structure,  enantiomeric purity, amino acid sequence, the chemical impurities and residual solvents of the drug substance. The techniques  used  for  structure  elucidation  include  FT-IR  spectroscopy,  UV  spectroscopy,  mass spectrometry (MS) for determination of molecular mass, MS/MS (collision induced dissociation) for sequence of amino acids, 1 H and 13 C-NMR spectroscopy (one and two dimensional experiments) for structure elucidation, GC-FID for identity and ratios of individual amino acids, and chiral amino acid analysis by GC-MS and LC-UV for identity and chirality of individual amino acids. Identity of the acetic acid was tested by RP LC-UV.

The NMR experiments were also carried out on a batch manufactured by the (former) SPPS process in order to confirm that the structure of degarelix was not modified when changing from SPPS to LPPS. No structural differences were detected.

Synthetic impurities and degradation products are adequately characterised and the proposed limits for impurities are established taking into account levels found  in the analysed batches.  During development  some  impurities  have  been  synthesised  and  used  to  control  the  purity  of  the  drug substance. As the impurity profiles of peptides prepared by SPPS and LPPS may be different, peptides

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

obtained  from  both  processes  were  analysed.  It  has  been  confirmed  that  different  synthesis  related impurity profiles do not affect degradation of degarelix.

##  Specification

The drug  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  identification  (electrospray  MS  and LC/UV),  assay  (LC),  related  substances  (LC/UV  and  GC/MS),  acetate  content  (LC/UV),  (KarlFisher), trifluoroacetate content, palladium, bacterial endotoxins and total viable aerobic count.

Test  for  acetate  content,  trifluoroacetate  content,  water  content,  palladium  bacterial  endotoxins  and total viable aerobic count are compendial tests performed according to relevant monographs. For non-compendial analytical methods such as the LC method with UV detection for identity and assay, an appropriate validation studies were performed. The content of impurities is analysed using several LC methods with UV detection and GC/MS method. All methods have been validated with regards to specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, range, limit of detection, limit of quantification and robustness.

In general analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the drug substance.

Batch analysis results were provided on 13 batches of degarelix. Two batches were of pilot scale and 11 of commercial scale batches. All results were within the specification limits and met requirements of the drug substance specification.

-  Stability

Stability  studies  have  been  performed  on  five  production  scale  batches  of  the  drug  substance. Degarelix was stored at long term (5  C  3  C)  and  accelerated  conditions  (25  C  2  C/60% RH  5% RH). Results generated during the studies (storage at 5°C ± 3°C) showed only minor degradation, and all results were within the specification limits.

A  forced  degradation  studies  (exposure  to  elevated  temperature,  humidity,  oxidation,  photolysis, alkaline  and  acidic  conditions)  have  been  performed  to  characterise  the  degradation  pathways  of degarelix.  Degradation  products  were  compared  with  synthesised  related  impurities  in  order  to elucidate  their  structure.  Main  degradation  products  were  identified  but  only  some  of  the  identified impurities have been observed during the long-term stability studies.

The stability data provided for the drug substance confirmed the proposed re-test period.

## Medicinal Product

##  Pharmaceutical Development

Aqueous solutions of the drug substance have been used in pharmacological screening and clinical studies, and were found to have the potential to form a depot form leading to a long duration of action of  degarelix.  However  solutions  of  degarelix  are  not  chemically  stable  for  long  term  storage  and therefore a freeze-dried formulation was developed.

In  early  development  of  the  drug  product  formulation  containing  drug  substance  synthesised  in  the solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) was used. Formulations containing drug substance synthesised in a liquid phase peptide synthesis (LPPS) were used in the phase 3 clinical study and are intended for market supply. Physicochemical properties of the drug substance obtained by two different routes of synthesis and of drug products, both laboratory scale and production scale, prepared from SPPS and LPPS drug substance were compared. It has been proven that physicochemical properties of the two substances were comparable. Initially three strengths have been developed but only two are intended for marketing (80 mg and 120 mg).

The fibrillation  of  degarelix  has  been  investigated  in  detail.  Although  the  solubility  of  degarelix  in water is initially high (concentrations up to 100 mg/ml can be prepared), degarelix aqueous solutions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tend to turn turbid and/or viscous with time as an indication of gelation, and may then be described as 'suspensions'. Degarelix gel-formation can be explained by intermolecular interactions (selfaggregation). Self-aggregation in aqueous solutions has been described for several GnRH analogues. The structure of the aggregates and the properties of the gels differ from one compound to another. In the case of degarelix, the gel formed in aqueous solution is based on a fibrillar network.

##  Adventitious Agents

None of the excipients used in the formulation or during the manufacturing process are of animal or human origin.

##  Manufacture of the Product

The  freeze  dried  drug  product  is  manufactured  by  a  standard  aseptic  process  which  includes sterilisation  by  filtration  of  the  formulated  bulk,  aseptic  filling  into  sterile  pyrogen  free  vials  and freeze-drying under aseptic conditions.

Solvent (water for injections) is filled, and terminally sterilised by autoclaving (121 °C/ 15 minutes). No special development was necessary. Validation results for the filter and the terminal sterilisation, respectively, have been provided

A detailed description of the manufacturing process was provided. The process has been validated on three pilot scale batches of both strengths and validation is ongoing for the commercial scale batches. Critical steps of the manufacturing process have been identified and are sufficiently controlled by inprocess control testing.

Batch analysis data on seven pilot scale and three commercial scale batches of the 80 mg strength and nine  pilot  scale  and  two  commercial  scale  batches  of  the  120  mg  strength  have  been  provided.  All results indicate satisfactory uniformity and compliance with the proposed specifications.

##  Product Specification

The drug product specifications include test for appearance, identification (LC/UV), degarelix content (LC/UV),  impurities  (LC/UV),  acetate  content  (LC/UV  or  capillary  electrophoresis),  water  content (Karl Fisher), uniformity of dosage units, pH, sterility, bacterial endotoxins, particulate contamination -visible and  subvisible particles, reconstitution time, optical density, viscosity and  in vitro dissolution. The dissolution test is not performed routinely, but the result is predicated based on the results of the optical density and viscosity tests

The solvent complies with the Ph Eur monograph - Water for Injections. The compendial specification has been amended with additional tests for pH, calcium content and carbon dioxide content.

Adequate  method  descriptions  have  been  provided  for  all  methods.  The  LC/UV  method  for identification,  degarelix  content  and  impurities  is  identical  with  the  method  used  for  the  drug substance (the  main part  of  the  method).  The  analytical  methods  and  acceptance  criteria  have  been established  to  confirm  the  identity,  purity  and  the  quality  of  the  drug  product  and  to  ensure  its suitability for their intended use.

##  Stability of the Product

The stability data was provided on three pilot scale batches for each of the strength. A reduced test design (matrixing) according to ICH Q1D was conducted to follow the stability of these batches. The 80 mg strength was stored up to 18 months and the 120 mg strength was stored up to 24 months at 25°C/60% RH  (normal  conditions).  For  both  strengths  results  from  the  accelerated  conditions (40°C/75% RH),  covering  period  up  to  6  months,  were  provided.  Parameters  subject  to  statistical analysis,  in  particular  specified  impurities,  as  well  as  total  degradation  products,  were  found  well within the shelf-life limits at the end of the shelf-life prediction.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results  form  photostability  studies,  proving  that  the  drug  product  is  photostable,  have  also  been provided.

The stability study will be further performed on the first three commercial scale batches of the drug product.

In-use  stability  of  the  reconstituted  drug  product  was  also  investigated.  The  drug  product  must  be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution however immediate administration after reconstitution is the preferable approach.

## Solvent

Three pilot scale batches of the solvent have been stored at long term (25°C/60% RH) and accelerated stability  studies  (40°C/75% RH).  60  months  long  term-  and  6  months  accelerated  stability  data  has been provided. First three production scale batches will be subjected to long term, intermediate and accelerated stability studies.

Based don the stability data the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions, as defined in the SPC, are acceptable.

-  Compatibility Exercise for Medicinal Product

Compatibility  of  formulation  with  the  proposed  container  closure  system  was  demonstrated  by  the ongoing  stability  studies.  After  reconstitution  an  aqueous  solution  of  degarelix  becomes  turbid  and viscous with time as a result of fibrillation of the drug substance. However, it was concluded that the solution was stable in its primary packaging during the first hour after reconstitution.

There is no precipitation of the drug substance as the formulation is exempted from salt excipients.

The solvent for reconstitution (water for injections) is included in the product.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The  drug  substance  and  the  drug  product  have  been  appropriately  characterised  and  generally satisfactory  documentation  has  been  provided.  The  excipients  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  drug product and manufacturing process selected are typical for injectable preparations. The results indicate that the drug substance and the drug product can be reproducibly manufactured.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were minor unresolved quality issues which have no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve it as a Follow-up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed time-frame.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

The  non-clinical  development  programme  of  degarelix  consisted  of  pharmacology  studies  (primary pharmacodynamics,  secondary  pharmacodynamics,  and  safety  pharmacology)  ,  pharmacokinetic studies (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacokinetic interactions), toxicology studies  (single  dose  toxicity,  repeat  dose  toxicity,  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity,  reproductive  and developmental toxicity, and local tolerance studies) and an environmental risk assessment.

## Pharmacology

##  Primary pharmacodynamics

In vitro , the binding of degarelix to cloned hGnRH receptor expressed in membranes from COS-I cells was measured in a radioligand binding assay. Degarelix showed a high affinity to the cloned human

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

GnRH  receptor  with  Ki  values  of  1,68  ±  0,12  nM.  Degarelix  demonstrated  similar  functional antagonism as three other GnRH peptide antagonists (azaline B, cetrorelix and ganirelix) when tested in vitro using HEK293 cells expressing a cloned human GnRH receptor and a luciferase reporter gene. No significant affinity towards 37 other receptors, mainly G-protein-coupled, was observed in vitro in radioligand binding assays.

In vivo ,  degarelix administered by s.c route in male Sprague Dawley rats induced a dose dependant reduction in testosterone levels. Long term suppression of testosterone levels was investigated in the intact  male  rats  in  comparison  with  surgical  castration  and  three  other  GnRH  antagonists  (abarelix, ganirelix and azaline B). A single administration of 2 mg/kg of degarelix showed a significant longer duration  of  action  than  the  other  antagonists  similarly  administered  with  respect  to  dose  and concentration.

In vivo, the effect of degarelix on prostate tumor size was investigated . Degarelix showed antitumoral activity  in  three  experimental  models  of  prostate  hormone  dependant  tumors:  androgen  dependent human  prostate  tumour  PAC120  in  the  nude  mice  and  androgen-dependent  rat  prostate  tumour Dunning R-3327H in rats when administered at the dose level of 2 mg/kg every two weeks and once a month respectively. At the tested doses, degarelix suppressed plasma testosterone levels and reduced tumour volume with efficacy similar to surgical castration. Degarelix had no effect on the growth of the androgen-independent human prostate tumour PC3.

##  Secondary pharmacodynamics

No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have submitted.

-  Safety pharmacology programme

The safety  pharmacology program included the ICH S7 safety pharmacology battery in addition to tests  on  renal,  autonomous  nervous  and  gastrointestinal  systems  (see  table  1  below).  These  studies raised  no  concerns,  although  effects  on  renal  and  gastrointestinal  systems  were  studied  at  small exposure multiples. However, toxicity studies at higher doses have not indicated that these organs are target organs.

Histamine releasing properties of degarelix have been investigated in vitro in rat peritoneal cells and human  skin  in  comparison  with  other  GnRH  antagonists  (abarelix,  cetrorelix  and  ganirelix). Histamine-releasing activity was weak and similar or lower than other GnRH antagonists tested. Degarelix  induced  no  statistically  significant  effect  on  cutaneous  vascular  permeability  following single intradermal administration in female rats. In a tolerance study in dogs prior to a cardiovascular study, dogs developed clinical signs consistent with a histamine reaction following three consecutive daily s.c doses of 20 mg/kg/day and higher.

##  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No specific pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been submitted.

## Pharmacokinetics

The following methods of analysis were used to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of degarelix in animal models: radioummunoassay, liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC\\_MS/MS), and scintillation counting of total radioactivity. The pharmacokinetics of degarelix was primarily obtained from the toxicology studies.

## Absorption

After  subcutaneous  administration,  degarelix  forms  a  local  depot  at  the  injection  site,  leading  to retarded  and  extended  release  of  the  active  drug.  The  release  from  the  depot  is  dependent  on  the concentration  in  the  dose  formulation  and  the  dose  volume.  Furthermore,  in  repeat  dose  studies, increasing concentrations in the dose formulation resulted in sub-proportional increases in maximum plasma  concentration  (C max )  and  area  under  plasma  concentration  vs  time  in  the  dosing  interval (AUC τ ),  an  increase  in  trough  plasma  concentration  (C trough ),  an  increase  in  terminal  half-life  (t 1/2 ), thus increasing the time to reach steady state, and a tendency of increase in time to maximum plasma concentration (T max ).

## Distribution

The protein binding in plasma of mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and humans was measured using the 3Hdegarelix  and  the  ultracentrifugation  technique.  The  plasma  binding  was  approximately  90%  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

animals  and  humans.  Distribution  of  radioactivity  following  administration  of  3H-degarelix  was studied  in  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys,  doses  were  respectively  0.03  mg/kg,  0.003  mg/kg  and  0.0082 mg/kg.  Radioactivity  of  tissues  was  measured  after  sacrifice  and  necropsy  of  the  animals.  High concentrations  were  mainly  seen  at  the  s.c.  injection  site  and  in  organs  of  excretion.  Lower concentrations,  but  still  higher  than  those  in  plasma  were  generally  seen  in  some  organs  of  the endocrine and reproductive systems most of which contain specific receptors for LHRH, and organs rich  in  reticuloendothelial  cells  during  the  elimination  phase.  There  was  no  indication  of  tissue retention.

## Metabolism

The stability of degarelix was studied in liver microsomes from males in rat, guinea pig, rabbit, dog, monkey, and human, for up to 60 min. No degradation of degarelix was detected in liver microsomes from rabbit, dog, monkey, and human. Tendency to minor degradation of degarelix was seen in liver microsomes from guinea pig and rat. The in vitro metabolism of degarelix was further investigated in human liver microsomes for up to 60 min. The metabolism pattern of degarelix was reported to be similar in humans and animals. Degarelix was virtually no substrate for oxidative metabolism, but was degraded by peptidases with generation of various truncated peptides. Only low concentration of one metabolite was seen in human plasma, and this metabolite was also seen in rats, dogs and monkeys. The metabolism data support the use of rats and monkeys for evaluation of toxicity.

## Excretion

Balance of the radioactivity following SC administration of 3H-degarelix was studied in rats, dogs and monkeys.  Degarelix  was  mainly  excreted  unchanged  via  the  urine  and  was  subject  to  sequential peptidic degradation during its elimination via the hepato-biliary pathway in both animals and man.

## Pharmacokinetic interactions

In vitro studies have been conducted to asses the effect of degarelix on hepatic isoenzymes and also on protein transporters (efflux and influx). No inhibition or induction effects were seen. No studies were carried out in animal biomaterials or in vivo .

## Toxicology

-  Single dose toxicity

Single dose toxicity studies have been conducted using subcutaneous and intravenous routes in mice, rats  and  monkeys.  The  acute  toxicity  studies  indicate  a  rather  low  toxicity  of  degarelix  after  s.c. dosing, which is the intended route of administration in humans. No deaths occurred, and no clinical signs were observed, except for a local reaction at the injection site and the expected pharmacological effect.  With i.v. dosing, the lowest lethal dose in rats was 12.5 mg/kg. Deaths occurred within minutes after dosing. Findings in decedents were non-specific, with congestion of internal organs.

-  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Studies have been performed with s.c and i.v administration. By subcutaneous route, rats and monkeys were treated up to 6 and 12 months respectively. Moreover, a 13-week study was carried out in mice, primarily as a dose range finding study for a carcinogenicity study. By intravenous route, treatment was  administered  for  up  to  4  weeks  in  rats  and  monkeys.    A  summary  of  the  pivotal  repeat  dose toxicity studies is presented below:

Following s.c administration, the predominant effects were related to the pharmacological properties of degarelix. Complete chemical castration was obtained at all dose levels, hence those effects that are related  to  the  pharmacological  effect  were  not  clearly  dose-related.  They  included  atrophy  of reproductive  organs,  effects  on  body  weight,  haematology,  and  clinical  chemistry.  Similar  changes were observed in the rat study comparing surgical castration with degarelix treatment. The maximum

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tolerated  dose  was  governed  by  the  local  reaction  at  the  injection  sites.  There  were  dose-related increases  in  the  local  reactions  at  injections  sites,  which  in  mice  and  rats  caused  signs  of  systemic toxicity in some studies. These were decrease in body weight, decrease in red blood cell parameters, elevated neutrophil counts, and in mice extramedullary haemopoiesis, granuolopoiesis in bone marrow and lymphoid hyperplasia. These systemic reactions have on occasion been the reason for pre-term euthanasia. In monkeys there was a dose-related increase in reactions at the injection site, which in the 12 month  study led to sacrifice of one high dose male  after 8 months. Disregarding the pharmacological effects or local reaction, no target organ was identified. Disregarding the systemic effects levels related to the local reaction, the NOAEL were 100 mg/kg/ 2weeks in mice and rats and 50 mg/kg/ 4 weeks in monkeys.

By  intravenous  route,  disregarding  the  pharmacological  effects,  the  findings  with  toxicological significance  were  transient  effects  on  the  blood  pressure  and  heart  parameters  in  both  species  and systemic toxicity in the lungs, kidneys, and liver in the rat, and the kidneys and liver in monkeys, with evidence of uptake of degarelix in cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) in lungs, liver and spleen.

##  Genotoxicity

The genotoxicity of degarelix has been studied with respect to gene mutations in bacteria, mutations in TK locus in vitro in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells and in vivo in the rat micronucleus test in bone marrow. The in vitro program including 6 Ames test and 6 TK locus assay in murine lymphoma was carried out as part of programmes to qualify changes of production methods. No genotoxic potential was evident in any test system.

##  Carcinogenicity

Long-term  (104-week)  carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  performed  in  mice  and  rats  following  s.c administration. There was a dose-related increase in severity of reactions at the injection site in both species.

In mice, degarelix was administered at 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg/2 weeks. In males, statistical significant increase in the incidence of focal hyperplasia of the intermediate lobe of the pituitary was observed from  the  lowest  dose  tested.    In  the  liver,  hepatocellular  adenoma  was  increase  in  incidence  in  all female groups and to a lesser extent in male. In the lung, bronchio-alveolar adenoma was increased in incidence in all female groups. There was an increased incidence of sarcoma at the injection site.

In rats, degarelix was administered at 2, 10 and 25 mg/kg/ 2 weeks. In female rats the incidence of hemangiosarcomas in the mesenteric lymph node was increased, however, the incidence was low, and there was no concurrent increase in treated males.

##  Reproduction Toxicity

In agreement with the pharmacological effect, treatment with degarelix resulted in infertility in male rats, which was reversible following termination of treatment. There was a good agreement between the persistence of degarelix in serum/plasma and the persistence of decreased testosterone levels. Disruption of hormonal balance in female rats and rabbits led to a dose-dependent prolongation of the time to mating and pregnancy, a reduced number of corpora lutea, increased number of pre- and postimplantation loss,  and  increased  number  of  abortions,  and  increased  number  of  early  embryo/foetal deaths, an increased number of premature delivery and an increased duration of parturition.  The dams were more sensitive to the effect of degarelix in the early part of the gestation period. No teratogenic effects  were  observed  in  rats  or  rabbits.  No  adverse  effects  during  lactation  or  on  pup  growth  and development were observed

##  Toxicokinetic data

The ratios between the mean  plasma concentrations at the highest dose level and plasma concentrations  in  humans  at  the  recommended  human  dose  were  17  and  12,4  in  mice  and  rats respectively.  This  data  was  obtained  from  104-week  carcinogenicity  studies  in  rats  and  mice  with subcutaneous administration of degarelix.

The effect of degarelix on fertility was examined in male rats and showed infertility.

To support possible indications in women, the effects of degarelix in embryo-foetal development were studied in rats  and  rabbits,  and  the  effects  of  degarelix  in  prenatal  and  postnatal  development  were evaluated in rats. Degarelix did not reveal any teratogenic potential in rats and rabbits. There were no adverse effects on pup growth and development. Studies in juvenile animals were not performed.

##  Local tolerance

Local tolerance has been examined following subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous administration in mice, rats and monkeys and in specific local tolerance in rabbits. The subcutaneous administration was associated with a dose dependent localised inflammatory response, resulting in the formation of a foreign body giant cell granuloma.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Other toxicity studies

Studies were conducted to examine the long term fate of a subcutaneous depot, to examine the acute distribution after a single lethal dose by intravenous administration and to evaluate target organs (the time to develop and the efficacy of clinical chemical markers of treatment-related hepatic and renal effects) in response to single and repeated intravenous administration of degarelix in rats. There was a tendency  for  a  decrease  in  availability  when  the  viscosity  in  the  dosing  solution  increased.  The potential for antigenicity and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis were studied in guinea pigs. There was no indication of degarelix stimulating an acute anaphylactic response in guinea pigs after subcutaneous induction  followed  by  either  intravenous  or  subcutaneous  challenge.  The  potential  for  inducing phototoxicity  was  also  assayed.  A  neutral  red  uptake  phototoxicity  assay  in  Balb/C  3T3  mouse fibroblasts indicated no potential for phototoxicity.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An environmental risk assessment was performed with reference to the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00).

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

The following non-clinical issues were identified in this application:

Regarding  the  environmental  risk  assessment,  given  the  pharmacological  activity  of  the  drug,  the CHMP considered that an endocrine disruptor activity could be suspected. As outlined in the guideline on the environmental risk assessment, some drug substances as potential endocrine disruptors need a Phase  II  environmental  risk  assessment  irrespective  of  the  quantity  release  into  the  environment. Therefore,  the  applicant    agreed  to  perform  a  phase  II  environmental  risk  assessment  with  an investigation of the endocrine disruptor activity as a follow-up measure, as requested by the CHMP. The studies  (readily  biodegradability,  adsorption  to  sewage  sludge  and  the  fish  screening  assay  for endocrine active substances) were considered an appropriate tailored risk assessment stategy, given that there are  no international accepted test guidelines for establishing endocrine disrupting effects

Degarelix is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients (see SPC section 4.3).

No formal  drug-drug  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  with  degarelix,  given  the  experience with GnRH analogues, and the little or no activity in the in vitro radioligand binding assays. Given that  androgen  deprivation  treatment  may  prolong  the  QTc  interval,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the concomitant use of degarelix with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval or drugs able to induce torsades  de  pointes  (e.g.  class  IA  (quinidine,  disopyramide)  or  class  III  (e.g.  amiodarone,  sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide) antiarrhythmic medicinal products, methadone, cisapride, moxifloxacine, antipsychotics,  etc.)  should  be  carefully  evaluated.  Degarelix  was  not  a  substrate  for  the  human CYP450  system  and  had  not  been  shown  to  induce  or  inhibit  CYP1A2,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9, CYP2C19,  CYP2D6,  CYP2E1,  or  CYP3A4/5  to  any  great  extent  in  vitro.  Therefore,  clinically significant  pharmacokinetic  drug-drug  interactions  in  metabolism  related  to  these  isoenzymes  are considered unlikely (see SPC section 4.5).

There is no relevant indication for use of degarelix in women. However, in both reproductive toxicity and toxicokinetic studies, no adverse effects during lactation or on pup growth and development were observed with degarelix (see SPC section 4.6).

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The clinical development programme of degarelix consisted of pharmacokinetic studies (absorption, bioavailability,  distribution,  excretion,  metabolism,  dose  proportionality,  special  populations,  drugdrug interactions and safety/interaction studies), pharmacodynamic studies, dose response studies and main clinical studies.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  degarelix  has  been  investigated  during  the  clinical  development program in:

-  three phase 1 studies in healthy subjects (CS01, CS05, CS08),
-  five  phase  II    studies  in  patients  with  prostate  cancer    (CS02,  CS06,  CS07,  CS12,  CS14, CS15),
-  one phase III study in patients with prostate cancer  (CS21),
-  one study  in Japanese patients (CS11),
-  one study in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (CS23).

In-vitro studies investigated plasma protein binding, metabolism, the stability of degarelix in plasma drug-drug interactions, and interaction with drug transporters.

During  the degarelix clinical development  programme,  bioanalytical methods  based  on both radioimmunoassay (RIA) and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LCMS/MS) were used for the quantification of degarelix in human biological samples (plasma, urine and plasma ultracentrifugate). The LC-MS/MS methods used to determine the degarelix concentrations in plasma  were    adequately  validated  with  respect  to  precision,  accuracy  and  stability.  However,  for some  methods  (0595/036  and  0595/046)  employed  in  a  total  of  10  studies,  high  variability  of  the internal standard and low and variable recovery values were considered a problem.

The measurement and identification of metabolites in vitro in human biomaterial and in vivo in human plasma, urine, and faeces was also performed by LC-MS/MS. However, no validation reports were submitted for the analysis of metabolites in plasma, urine and faeces.

Two different methods were used to manufacture the drug substance: One formulation (SPPS) is used in all phase I and most phase II studies while the other formulation (LPPS) is used in only two phase II (CS15/15A  and  CS18)  and  one  phase  III  (CS21/21A)  study.  The  pharmacokinetics  of  the  two formulations,  when  administered  s.c.,  seems  not  to  be  identical.  However,  no  bioequivalence  study comparing these two types of formulations has been performed. Thus, the applied posology regarding dose, concentration and formulation has not been tested adequately in pharmacokinetic studies. A new, thorough  PK  study  with  the  applied  posology  and  formulation  was  requested  to  be  performed  to confirm the simulated data as a follow-up measure (see discussion on clinical pharmacology aspects).

-  Absorption

The pharmacokinetics of degarelix were investigated int three studies (CS06, CS07 and CS11) after single dose administrations in prostate cancer patients. The mean terminal half-life was long (between 23 and 61 days) and markedly variable between subjects and studies. C max (maximum observed serum concentration) and AUC (Area Under the Concentration) were influenced by several factors including dose, number of injections and the concentration of the delivered degarelix suspension. T max ranged from 34 to 62 hours. Steady state occurred after 5-6 months with the 240/80 mg dosing regimen. With regards to absorption, after subcutaneous administration of 240 mg degarelix at a concentration of 40 mg/ml to prostate cancer patients in the pivotal study CS21, the AUC 0-28 days was 635 (602-668) day*ng/ml, Cmax was 66.0 (61.0-71.0) ng/ml and occurred at Tmax at 40 (37-42) hours. Mean trough

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

values  were  approximately  11-12  ng/ml  after  the  starting  dose  and  11-16  ng/ml  after  maintenance dosing of 80 mg at a concentration of 20 mg/ml.

##  Bioavailability

The pharmacokinetic properties of degarelix after a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection to healthy men were investigated in studies CS01 and CS05. The bioavailability was calculated to 30-40% for both administration routes.

##  Distribution

Degarelix was found to be released from the depot form in two phases: a first phase of fast release shortly  after  dosing  followed  by  a  slow  release  phase.  Spontaneous  formation  of  the  gel-like  depot only  occurs  after  injection  of  degarelix  suspension  at  concentrations ≥ 5mg/mL.  The  distribution volume in healthy elderly men was approximately 1 l/kg and plasma protein binding is estimated to be approximately 90%.

Binding of degarelix was mainly on serum albumin and  1- and glycoprotein. Estimated Vd (volume of distribution) was high and close to 1L/Kg.

##  Elimination

Approximately  20  %  of  degarelix  appears  to  be  excreted  unchanged  in  the  urine.  Degarelix  is eliminated in a biphasic fashion, with a  median terminal half-life of approximately 43 days for the starting dose or 28 days for the maintenance dose, as estimated based on population pharmacokinetic modelling.

##  Metabolism

Degarelix is subject to common peptidic degradation during the passage of the hepato-biliary system and is mainly excreted as peptide fragments in the faeces. No significant metabolites were detected in plasma  samples  after  subcutaneous  administration.  In  vitro  studies  showed  that  degarelix  is  not  a substrate  for  the  human  CYP450  system.  In  healthy  men,  approximately  20-30%  of  a  single intravenously administered dose was excreted in the urine, suggesting that 70-80% is excreted via the hepato-biliary  system.  The  clearance  of  degarelix  when  administered  as  single  intravenous.  doses (0.864-49.4µg/kg) in healthy elderly men was found to be 35-50 ml/h/kg.

The  data  relative  to  drug  metabolism  through  hepatic  system  are  sparse  and  not  part  of  the  main clinical pharmacokinetic studies (CS01, CS06, CS07, CS23).

##  Pharmacokinetics of metabolites

No active metabolites were identified and only one of the six identified metabolites were detected in plasma.

Two studies in human liver microsomes showed that degarelix is a very poor substrate for the CYP450 metabolism in vitro. Further, degarelix showed no propensity to form glucuronidated metabolites in vitro.  In  line  with  this,  no  oxidative  metabolites  or  conjugated  metabolites  of  degarelix  have  been detected in samples from clinical studies.

Small amounts (0-10%) of FE 200486(1-9) (2.7.2) were detected in plasma from CS11 and CS23. This is a known metabolite of degarelix and has previously been detected in human liver microsomes and in animal  plasma  and  excreta.  The  presence  of  less  than  10%  of  FE  200486(1-9)  in  plasma  was  not regarded to be of any clinical relevance.

-  Dose proportionality and time dependencies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Global dose-proportionality for Cmax and AUC was established from single-dose studies in healthy subjects and prostate cancer patients. Pharmacokinetic follow-up during repeated administrations (up to 11-12 doses) showed no signs of drug accumulation (through levels).

##  Pharmacokinetics in target population

Comparison  of  clearance  and  distribution  volume  between  healthy  subjects  and  prostate  cancer patients are presented in table 4 below:

##  Special populations

## Impaired renal function

No  specific  study  was  conducted  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  (see  discussion  on  clinical pharmacology aspects).

## Impaired hepatic function

The  study  performed  in  subjects  with  mild  or  moderate  hepatic  impairment  was  conducted  with  a single i.v. dose (1.0mg) and not with a s.c. dose representative of the proposed schedule (CS23). Study CS23 was an open-label, single center, single-dose, controlled study conducted in three parallel groups of  eight  subjects  each,  two  test  groups  of  subjects  with  hepatic  diseases  (mild  or  moderate  hepatic impairment) and a control group of healthy subjects. The study showed that there was no increased exposure  to  degarelix  in  hepatically  impaired  patients  compared  to  healthy  subjects.  Actually, somewhat  lower  exposure  was  seen  especially  in  patients  with  moderate  hepatic  dysfunction. Furthermore,  a  rapid  decrease  in  the  plasma  levels  of  testosterone  and  LH  in  healthy  as  well  as hepatically impaired subjects was seen subsequently to the degarelix administration.

## Gender

Degarelix is not indicated in women. Therefore the impact of the gender on the degarelix PK profile was not studied.

## Race

There is no evidence that the PK profile of degarelix is different between different races.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Weight and elderly:

The impact of these factors on the PK profile of degareliw was assesses via a PK modelling analysis based  on  the  pivotal  study  CS21.  It  would  have  been  advisable  to  examine  the  impact  of  age  and weight on degarelix pharmacokinetics by performing a comparative analysis with true observed data. Indeed, the PK modelling analysis shows a significant impact of weight and age on the PK parameters of  degarelix.  Weight  and  age  were  covariates  in  the  FE200486  CS21  PK  Modelling  Report,  and degarelix clearance was estimated to increase with weight at a rate of 0.7% per kg, and central volume of distribution (V1) to increase 4% per kg body weight. With increasing age, clearance of degarelix was estimated to decrease at a rate of 0.6% per year. These results are not mentioned in the SPC and no dose adjustment is proposed. This point needs some explanation.

## Ethnic origin and tumour stage at enrolment

Ethnic  origin  (Hispanic  vs  not  Hispanic)  and  tumour  stage  at  enrolment  show  to  have  significant effects on AUC0-28 at the alpha=0.05 significance level.  These findings are not confirmed at the end of one year treatment duration.

The PK modelling analysis based on the pivotal study  CS21  shows  that  the  maintenance  dose  had significant effects on degarelix trough levels on Days 308 and 336 (p ≤ 0.05). These results need to be commented in the frame of the selected maintenance dose in the SPC.

## Children

There is no paediatric development programme for this medicinal product.

-  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

## Drug-drug interaction (DDI)

The in vitro metabolism of degarelix was further investigated in human liver microsomes. The total amount of the oxidative metabolites formed was very low (&lt;1% of the initial amount of degarelix in the incubation samples), indicating that degarelix is not a substrate for the human CYP450 system. Data from the in vitro studies have not shown any inhibitory effects on hepatic isoenzymes CYPlA2, CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6,  CYP2E1  and  CYP3A4/5  nor  any  induction  potential  on  CYPlA2, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5 activity. In addition degarelix has been screened in cultured human cell-lines for interactions with various transporter proteins, efflux transporters (p-glycoprotein, MRP2, BCRP, BSEP) as well as uptake transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1).

Therefore, the PK profile of degarelix is unlikely to be affected by concomitant medication, nor to have any effect on the metabolism or excretion of such medication. Moreover, no clinical PK drugdrug interaction studies were conducted.

The target population for degarelix treatment often presents with co-morbidities and consequently to comedications which might interact with degarelix. On a pharmacokinetic aspect, the Applicant has conducted in vitro studies to asses the effect of degarelix on hepatic isoenzymes CYPlA2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 and also on protein transporters (efflux and influx). Results  showed  that  degarelix  has  no  inducing  or  inhibitory  effect  on  these  enzymes  and  transport proteins. As regards degarelix metabolites (free amino acids derived from peptidase cleavage), in the frame of a Scientific Advice in June 2004, the Applicant was encouraged to perform further in vitro studies assessing the effect of metabolites on cytochromes. However, considering the low circulating metabolite amount, this issue is not considered as needed excepted for CYP2C9. Indeed, in human liver microsomes a slight, dose-independent degarelix-induced increase of CYP2C9 activity was seen. Additional  data  on  this  possible  effect  and  potential  interactions  with  drugs  metabolised  by  this pathway should be provided.

In addition, the lack of in vitro studies assessing the inhibition and induction potential of degarelix on CYP2C8 and CYP2B6, two isoenzymes potentially involved in clinically relevant interactions; needs to be explained.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Degarelix  appears  to  have  a  mild  pharmacokinetic  interaction  profile  but  this  does  not  preclude  to pharmacodynamic interactions.

## Pharmacodynamic interactions

No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed.

## Safety / Interactions

The only prohibited medications during these studies were other hormone manipulative drugs, and, in CS21,  those  which  might  prolong  the  QT  interval  as  well  as  5α reductase  inhibitors.  Therefore, during the clinical  study program,  the  use  of  concomitant  medications  in  the  study  populations  has been extensive without evidence of any impact on the therapeutic effect or safety of either degarelix or the concomitant treatment.

The Applicant claims that there is no evidence of interaction between degarelix and concomitant drugs and cross-referred to a table which shows the distribution of comedications in the different arms of the 2/3 phase studies.

However,  no  clear  table  of  adverse  events  with  and  without  degarelix  in  patients  treated  by  other drugs, (specifying the name and dosage of the concomitant drug) has been displayed. The Rapporteur insists on the fact that even if degarelix is subject to mild pharmacokinetic interaction, pharmacodynamic  one  (other  than  QT  prolonging-drugs  because  excluded  from  clinical  studies) cannot be ruled out. The corresponding data should be provided as a follow-up measure.

##  Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

No studies investigating the pharmacokinetics of degarelix using human biomaterials were submitted.

## Pharmacodynamics

##  Mechanism of action

Degarelix is a decapeptide that antagonizes pituitary gland GnRH receptors. This compound differs from GnRH agonists in that it is a selective and competitive blocker of GnRH receptors and not an GnRH agonists  (with a reversible effect). The consequence is an absence of flare up at the beginning of  the  treatment  as  observed  with  GnRH  GnRH  agonists.  In  addition,  it  differs  from  previous generation of GnRH antagonists in that it has weak histamine releasing properties in vitro.

##  Primary and Secondary pharmacology

The pharmacodynamic effect of degarelix in pre-clinical models is also confirmed by clinical studies. In  clinical  studies  in  both  healthy  subjects  and  patients  with  prostate  cancer,  the  profile  of  rapid testosterone suppression following degarelix administration, without any surge has been observed. A dose-response relationship was observed with respect to both the degree of testosterone suppression and  the  duration,  as  illustrated  by  CS01  (healthy  subjects),  in  which  s.c.  single  doses  of  degarelix ranging from 10 mg to 40 mg were investigated. It was also noted that similar to the PK profile, the pharmacodynamic effect was also influenced by the concentration of the degarelix suspension.

Data from the studies CS06, CS07 and CS11 in patients with prostate cancer demonstrated that the duration  of  testosterone  suppression  was  highly  dependent  on  both  the  dose  and  concentration  of degarelix  administered.  These  studies  showed  that  starting  doses  of  200  mg  and  240  mg  at  a concentration  of  40  mg/mL  suggested  an  effective  and  sustained  response  during  the  first  28  days. Two multiple dose studies, CS12 and CS14, showed that doses of 160 mg (40 mg/mL) and 80 mg (20 mg/mL) could be effective maintenance doses for evaluation in the pivotal study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interaction studies

During the  clinical  study  program,  the  use  of  concomitant  medication  in  the  study  populations  has been evaluated without evidence of any impact on the therapeutic effect or safety of either degarelix or the concomitant treatment.

In the Phase 3 active control study, the treatment groups were comparable in the use of concomitant medications. Most of the concomitant medications were in the anatomic main groups of cardiovascular system  (62%),  alimentary  tract  and  metabolism  (39%),  blood  and  blood  forming  organs  (33%), nervous  system  (31%),  and  musculoskeletal  system  (30%).  Particularly  at  the  therapeutic  subgroup level,  most  commonly  used  concomitant  medications  were  agents  acting  on  the  renin-angiotensin system (38%), antithrombotic agents (29%), antiinflammatory and antirheumatic products (26%), lipid modifying agents (24%), antibacterials for systemic use (23%), analgesics (23%), beta-blocking agents (22%), calcium channel blockers (17%), urologicals (17%), diuretics (16%), cardiac therapy (14%), drugs for acid related disorders (12%), and drugs used in diabetes (11%). The most commonly used concomitant medications in both treatment groups (degarelix and placebo) in the Phase 1 studies were analgesics (25%).

However,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  provide  a  clear  table  of  adverse  events  with  and  without degarelix  in  patients  treated  with  other  drugs,  specifying  the  name  and  dosage  of  the  concomitant drug.

## Discussion on clinical pharmacology aspects

The  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  analytical  methods  0595/36  and  0595/046  had  not  been adequately  validated,  and  therefore  the  PK  data  obtained  using  these  methods  [0595/036  (in  the studies  CS02A,  CS06/06A  and  CS07/07A)  and  0595/046  (in  the  studies  CS11/11A,  CS12/12A, CS15/15A, CS18, CS21/21A and CS23)] was considered unreliable. In addition, PK data on the LPPS formulation  was  considered  to  be  very  limited,  and  the  available  data  was  only  obtained  from  two phase  II  studies  (CS15/CS15A  and  CS18)  and  one  phase  III  study  (CS21/21A),  using  the  abovementioned methods.  Therefore the applicant was asked to provide a new PK study with the applied posology and formulation, using an adequately validated analytical method as a follow-up measure , The  applicant  subsequently  committed  to  perform  a  dedicated  single/multiple  dose  PK-study  in patients with prostate cancer (n=30) using the applied posology and the applied formulation (LPPS) and provide the study protocol in the first quarter of 2009.

It  is  a  weakness  of  the  submitted  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  that  individual  conventional pharmacokinetic  data  were  not  obtained  in  the  target  population  with  the  proposed  degarelix administration schedule. None of the pharmacokinetic (PK) studies have used the same combination of doses and concentrations as the applied posology. Only pooled data were obtained from the different subjects.

Based on results from the study DCB-MAR-9, assessing in vitro effect of degarelix on CYP2C8, the CHMP  did  not  expect  that  degarelix  might  inhibit  this  isoenzyme  at  therapeutic  concentration. However, with regards to CYP2B6, the lack of degarelix inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, 1A2, 2D6, 2C9 or 2C19 does not preclude any effect on CYP2B6. Therefore the CHMP requested that the applicant investigate  an  in  vitro  study  assessing  the  effect  of  degarelix  on  this  isoenzyme,  as  a  follow-up measure, to which the applicant commited

With regards to cytochromes induction, the CHMP requested that further in vitro studies be carried out in  order  to  explore  the  induction  effect  of  degarelix  on  CYP2C8,  2C19  and  2B6,  as  a  follow-up measure to which the applicant commited.

The pharmacokinetics of degarelix are adequately reflected in the SPC (see section 5.2)

Degarelix is eliminated in a biphasic fashion, with a  median terminal half-life of approximately 43 days  for  the  starting  dose  or  28  days  for  the  maintenance  dose,  as  estimated  based  on  population pharmacokinetic  modelling. The long half-life after subcutaneous administration is a consequence of a very slow release of degarelix from the depot formed at the injection site(s). The pharmacokinetic behaviour of the drug is influenced by its concentration in the solution for injection. Thus, Cmax and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

bioavailability  tend  to  decrease  with  increasing  dose  concentration  while  the  half-life  is  increased. Therefore, no other dose concentrations than the recommended should be used.

Two special populations were further discussed (patients with renal impairment and patients with hepatic impairment):

With  regards  to  patients  with  renal  impairment,  no  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  conducted.  Only about  20-30%  of  a  given  dose  of  degarelix  was  excreted  unchanged  by  the  kidneys.  A  population pharmacokinetics  analysis  of  the  data  from  the  confirmatory  Phase  III  study  demonstrated  that  the clearance of degarelix in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment is reduced by approximately 23%;  therefore dose  adjustment  in patients with mild or moderate  renal impairment  is not recommended. Data on patients with severe renal impairment was scarce and the CHMP warranted caution in this patient population.

Degarelix  was  also  studied  in  a  pharmacokinetic  study  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  hepatic impairment.  No  signs  of  increased  exposure  in  the  hepatically  impaired  subjects  were  observed compared to healthy subjects. Dose adjustment was not considered necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. However, patients with severe hepatic dysfunction were not studied and caution is therefore warranted in this group.

## Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of degarelix was evaluated in prostate cancer patients in eight Phase 2 studies and six Phase  2  extension  studies,  and  in  one  Phase  3  study  and  its  extension  study.  The  status,  design features, dosing regimens, and numbers of patients in these studies are summarized in table 5 below:

Cut off date: 28 September 2007.

Extension study numbers include an 'A' after the CS number of the main study (e.g., CS21A is the extension study of the main study CS21). The primary endpoint in all studies was the reduction of serum testosterone to castrate levels (i.e., ≤ 0.5 ng/mL).

The primary prostate cancer inclusion criteria were similar throughout the Phase 2/3 program. Eligible patients were to have a histologically confirmed (Gleason graded) adenocarcinoma of the prostate (any stage). This included patients with a rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) level who had previously undergone prostatectomy or radiotherapy with curative intent. Patients had to have a PSA value of ≥ 2 ng/mL, except for the first study [FE200486 CS02, in which the PSA value had to be ≥ 20 ng/mL.

'A' following a study number indicates that the study is an extension of the main study. Also, 'FE 200486' that precedes each study number is the sponsor's internal code for degarelix. Further citations of study numbers will be by CS number only.

##  Dose response studies

## Starting dose

According to the applicant, Study CS06 suggested that the dose of 120mg leads to the longest median

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

time  to  insufficient  testosterone  response  and  the  highest  proportion  of  patients  with  testosterone response in comparison with the other tested doses. However neither the 120mg nor the other doses reached a sufficient proportion of patients (i.e between 90% and 100%) with testosterone response. Study CS07 suggested that the doses/concentration combinations of 200 mg (40 mg/mL) and 240 mg (40 mg/mL) produce an effective and sustained response for at least 28 days and could be considered as acceptable starting regimens. The repeated dose study CS12 suggested that the doses/concentration combinations of 240 mg (40 mg/mL) as starting dose produced an effective response for at least 28 days.  Indeed,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  testosterone  suppression  (testosterone ≤ 0.5  ng/mL)  at Day 28 was higher (although not statistically significant) after the 240 mg than the 200 mg initiation dose. For the 240@40 pooled group the proportion of patients with testosterone ≤ 0.5 ng/mL was 95% (n=93, 5 failures) whereas for the 200@40 pooled group the proportion was 86% (n=94, 13 failures) (p=0.089).

## Maintenance monthly dose

According to the applicant, Study CS12 suggested that maintenance doses of 160 mg (40mg/ml) or 120 mg (40mg/ml) produce sustained testosterone suppression. Study CS14 suggested that the maintenance dose of 80 mg (20mg/ml) produces a higher testosterone suppression out to day 364, than the 60 mg (20mg/ml).

-  Main study

## Study FE 200486 CS21

## METHODS

CS21 an open-label study with different routes of administration for degarelix  Subcutaneous (s.c) and leuprorelin 7.5 mg, Intramuscular (i.m.).

Patients were assessed for testosterone, PSA, LH and FSH on day 0, 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28, and then every 28 days for one year.

Patients who received degarelix were assessed for degarelix concentration before treatment on day 0, after starting dose on day 1, 3, 7 and 14, and before treatment on day 28, 308 and 336.

Some  patients  were  included  in  a  sub-study  in  France,  Germany,  Romania  and  Netherlands.  An Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) investigation was introduced at baseline, on day 28, 196 and day 364, in order to evaluation tumour size and  infiltration into adjacent tissues.

Patients completed Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaires on day 0, 28, 84, 168 and at the end of study visit.

An external, independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) was established to ensure the safety of the patients participating in the study, composed of three clinical experts and a statistician. There were  no  findings  by  the  Ferring  Safety  Committee  or  the  DSMB  that  had  an  impact  on  the  study conduct and no safety concerns were identified.

## Objectives

This  study  investigated  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  two  degarelix  dosing  regimens  with  a  240  mg starting dose and either 160 mg (40 mg/mL) or 80 mg (20 mg/mL) maintenance doses, and leuprorelin 7.5 mg administered at monthly intervals for up to 12 months in patients with prostate cancer. Both degarelix dosing regimens were compared against a threshold value for suppression of testosterone to castrate levels and to leuprorelin 7.5 mg.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary endpoint

- -Probability of testosterone ≤ 0.5 ng/mL from Day 28 through Day 364.

## Secondary endpoints

- -Proportion of patients with testosterone surge during the first 2 weeks of treatment
- -Proportion of patients with testosterone level ≤ 0.5 ng/mL at Day 3
- -Percentage change in PSA from baseline to Day 28
- -Probability of testosterone ≤ 0.5 ng/mL from Day 56 through Day 364
- -Serum levels of testosterone, LH, FSH and PSA over time
- -Time to PSA failure (two consecutive increases of 50%, and at least 5 ng/mL as compared to nadir)
- -Degarelix concentration over the first month and trough levels at Day 308 and 336
- -Frequency  and  size  of  testosterone  increases  at  Day  255  and/or  259  compared  to  the testosterone level at Day 252
- -Frequency and severity of AEs
- -Clinically significant changes in laboratory values
- -Change in ECGs and vital signs
- -Quality  of  life  on  Days  0,  28,  84,  168  and  End  of  Study  Visit  (EORTC  Cancer  Specific Questionnaire  -  EORTC  QLQ-C30  and  Short  Form  12,  version  2  Health  Survey  Scoring Demonstration- SF-12 ~2)
- -Hot  flush  frequency  and  hot  flush  score  daily  from  study  start  until  End  of  Study  Visit (endpoint assessed for all patients except those from Mexico, Romania, Russia and Ukraine)
- -Probability of sufficient testosterone response from Day 28 through Day 364 (a patient was considered  to  have  insufficient  testosterone  response  if  he  had  one  testosterone  value  &gt;1.0 ng/mL or two consecutive testosterone values &gt;0.5 ng/mL at Day 28 onwards)
- -Percentage change in PSA from baseline to Day 14.
- -Serum  testosterone  levels  were  determined  using  a  validated  LC-MS/MS  assay  .  For  each timepoint, samples were analysed in triplicate and the median testosterone value was reported.

## Sample size

For the study to demonstrate with 90% power, that the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval was ≥ 90%,  it  was  calculated  that  200  patients  would  be  needed  for  each  degarelix  treatment  group, assuming a 96% testosterone response rate and a drop-out rate of 15%.

With 200 patients per treatment group, there would be &gt;90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority of degarelix versus leuprorelin 7.5 mg with respect to the probability of testosterone ≤ 0.5 ng/mL from Day 28 to Day 364, assuming a common response rate of 96%, a non-inferiority margin of -10%, a two-sided significance level of 2.5% and a drop-out rate of 15%.

In total, 600 patients (200 per treatment group) would need to be recruited.

## Randomisation

At screening, all  potential  participants  in  the  study  received  a  unique  screening  number  which  was entered into the Screening log. Patients who met the eligibility criteria were recruited into this study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and randomised in parallel to one of the three treatment groups. Randomisation lists were prepared centrally by the Department of Biometrics, Ferring Pharmaceuticals A/S using a validated computer program. These randomisation lists were stratified by geographic region (Central and Eastern Europe, Western Europe, The Americas) and body weight (&lt;90 kg and ≥ 90 kg) and were prepared before the first patient was enrolled into the study.

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open-label study as blinding was not possible due to different routes of administration for degarelix  and  the  comparator  (leuprorelin).  However,  the  treatment  was  blinded  for  the  central laboratory  personnel.  In  addition,  Ferring  personnel  were  blinded  to  the  hormone  results  (serum testosterone, PSA, LH and FSH) during the main part of the study after the last patient was recruited.

## Statistical methods

For the primary endpoint, two hypotheses were tested:

1. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the probability of testosterone ≤ 0.5  ng/ml from Day 28 through 364 is no lower than 90%

H01: π Degarelix &lt;90% against the alternative H A1 : π Degarelix ≥ 90 %

where π Degarelix denotes  the  probability  of  testosterone ≤ 0.5  ng/ml  from  Day  28  through  364  after treatment with degarelix.

The null hypothesis (H 01 ) was tested against the alternative (H A1 ) by constructing a 95% confidence interval for each treatment arm. For calculation of the 95% confidence interval, the standard error was calculated using the log-log transformation of the survivor function in order to yield plausible values.

2. Degarelix is non-inferior to LUPRON DEPOT 7.5 mg with respect to probability of testosterone ≤ 0.5  ng/ml  from  Day  28  through  364.  The  non-inferiority  limit  for  the  difference  between treatments (degarelix versus LUPRON DEPOT 7.5 mg) was -10 percentage points

H02: π Degarelix -π LUPRON DEPOT® 7.5 mg ≤ -10 percentage points against the alternative H A2 : π Degarelix -π LUPRON DEPOT® 7.5 mg &gt; -10 percentage points, where π Degarelix and π LUPRON DEPOT® 7.5 mg denote the probability of testosterone ≤ 0.5 ng/ml from Day 28 through 364 after treatment with degarelix and LUPRON DEPOT 7.5 mg, respectively.

Two  separate  non-inferiority  assessments  were  performed  (degarelix  240/160  mg  vs.  LUPRON DEPOT 7.5 mg and degarelix 240/90 vs. LUPRON DEPOT 7.5 mg). In order to protect the overall type I error rate of 5%, this was corrected using the bonferroni-method, and therefore each assessment was  performed  on  a  significance  level  of  2.5%.  The  null  hypothesis  (H 02 )  was  tested  against  the alternative  (H A2 )  by  constructing  a  two-sided  97.5%  confidence  interval  for  the  difference  in probability of testosterone ≤ 0.5 ng/ml from Day 28 through 364. The 97.5% confidence interval for the difference between treatments was based on the pooled standard error.

## Sensitivity analyses

A  Cox-proportional  hazards  analysis  was  added  as  sensitivity  analysis.  Testosterone  monitoring frequency (number of non-missing testosterone values /treatment months) was included as covariate. If  a  patient  dropped  out  at  month  8  with  only  5  non-missing  testosterone  values  then  monitoring frequency  was  5/8.  Patients  with  no  non-missing  testosterone  values  had  monitoring  frequency  =1, regardless of whether the patients completed the study (13/13=1) or not.

Only in the case of a statistically significant additive effect of monitoring frequency, was its impact discussed  by  providing  95%  one  year  suppression  probabilities  (and  97.5%  CI  of  the  difference  of each of the degarelix arms vs. LUPRON DEPOT 7.5 mg) of for those with no missing testosterone

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

values vs. those with at least one missing testosterone values. The 97.5% confidence interval for the difference  between  treatments  was  based  on  the  pooled  standard  error,  calculated  similar  as  the primary analysis. Primary analyses were based on the analysis unadjusted for monitoring frequency in the case of no statistically significant effect of monitoring frequency.

This  analysis  was  performed  both  for  the  ITT  and  the  PP  analysis  set.  The  efficacy  results  are presented for the ITT analysis set.

## Insufficient testosterone response

Testosterone was measured in triplicates and the median was used.

An extra efficacy endpoint was added:

-  Probability of sufficient testosterone response from Day 28 through Day 364,

The same time-points as for the primary endpoint and the same statistical methodology and similar displays were used for this endpoint.

## Injection site reactions

Crude  incidences  (n/N),  incidence  rates  expressed  as  number  of  patients  with  at  least  one  local tolerability reaction (reported as an AE) per 100 injections, were reported.

## Missing values and drop-outs

Drop-outs were accounted for by the Kaplan-Meier approach.

For patients discontinued before Day 28, time to testosterone &gt; 0.5 ng/ml was censored at the time from dosing for the last available testosterone  measurement. Patients discontinued between Day 28 and Day 364 (both inclusive) with all testosterone measurements ≤ 0.5 ng/ml were censored at the time from dosing for the last available testosterone measurement.

If a patient had a missing value after Day 28 with testosterone values ≤ 0.5 ng/ml before and after the specific time point it is reasonable to assume that the testosterone value at the missing visit was also ≤ 0.5 ng/ml, and therefore the missing value was set to ' ≤ 0.5 ng/ml'. If one or both of the surrounding values was &gt; 0.5 ng/ml, the patient was considered a failure at the first visit where testosterone was &gt; 0.5  ng/ml  If  the  patient  had  completed  the  study,  the  Day  364  value  was  missing,  and  all  previous values from Day 28 onwards were ≤ 0.5 ng/ml, the Day 364 value was also set to ' ≤ 0.5 ng/ml'. If the Day  28  value  was  missing  and  the  patient  continued  in  the  study  to  Day  28  or  beyond,  the  last observation before Day 28 was carried forward.

## Secondary endpoints

The  number  and  percentage  of  patients  with  a  testosterone  surge  during  the  first  two  weeks  of treatment were presented by treatment group and for the pooled degarelix group together with p-values derived from Fisher's exact test.

The  number  and  percentage  of  patients  with  testosterone ≤ 0.5  ng/ml  at  Day  3  were  presented  by treatment group and for the pooled degarelix group together with p-values derived from Fisher's exact test.

For the median percentage change in PSA from baseline to Day 28, each degarelix group as well as the pooled degarelix group was compared to LUPRON DEPOT 7.5 mg by a Wilcoxon test using the normal approximation.

Kaplan-Meier  estimates  of  the  probability  of  testosterone ≤ 0.5  ng/ml  from  Day  56  to  364  were presented by treatment group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The time to PSA failure was defined as the days from first dosing (scheduled study days) where an increase  in  serum  PSA  of ≥ 50%  from  nadir  and  at  least  5  ng/ml  measured  on  two  consecutive occasions at least two weeks apart was noted. That is, the two consecutive values must both represent:

-  An absolute increase of ≥ 5 ng/ml above nadir and
-  An increase of ≥ 50% of nadir

The  probability  of  completing  the  study  without  experiencing  PSA  failure  was  estimated  and presented for each treatment group using Kaplan-Meier methods.

## RESULTS

Participant flow

## Patient withdrawals

Of the 620 patients randomised to this study, ten did not receive degarelix/leuprorelin treatment. These patients  withdrew  from  the  study  for  the  following  reasons:  withdrew  consent,  taking  prohibited medication, randomisation errors, language barriers, not satisfying inclusion criteria, drug delay which meant the patient would have to be re-screened.

There  were  610  patients  that  received  at  least  one  dose  of  degarelix/  leuprorelin  and  which  were included in the ITT analysis set. Of these, 504 (83%) patients completed the study with 163 (81%) patients in the degarelix 240/160 mg group, 169 (82%) patients in the degarelix 240/80 mg group and 172  (86%)  patients  in  the  leuprorelin  group,  thus  more  leuprorelin  patients  than  degarelix  patients completed the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AEs were the most common reason for withdrawal with 34 (8%) patients withdrawn in the degarelix groups and 12 (6%) in the leuprorelin group. Of these, 18 patients died while receiving treatment, five (2%) and four (2%) patients in the degarelix groups 240/80 mg and 240/160 mg, respectively, and nine (4%) in the leuprorelin group. Withdrawals due to non-fatal AEs were highest in the degarelix groups with  14  (7%)  and  10  (5%)  patients  withdrawn  from  the  240/160  mg  and  240/80  mg  groups, respectively,  and  three  (1%)  patients  in  the  leuprorelin  group.  Fifty-two  patients  withdrew  due  to 'other' reasons, mainly (&gt;1 patient): withdrew consent (20 patients), taking prohibited medication (5), met exclusion criteria (4), missed study visit (4), unable to attend study visits (3), disease progression (2), patient relocated (2).

## Protocol Deviations

There were 39 (6%) patients in the ITT analysis set with at least one major protocol deviation including 30 (7%) who received degarelix and nine (4%) patients who received leuprorelin (Table 6).

## Recruitment

First patient visit  was on the 7. Feb. 2006. Last patient last visit was on the 8. Oct. 2007

## Conduct of the study

After finalisation of the CS21 protocol (01 December 2005) four protocol amendments were introduced, and the main changes are described below.

Protocol Amendment 1: 14 February 2006

Protocol Amendment 2: 14 February 2006

Protocol Amendment 3: 10 April 2006

Protocol Amendment 4: 25 September 2006

Protocol amendments 1, 2 and 4 were reviewed and approved by the IECs/ IRBs and regulatory authorities before implementation. Amendment 3 was reviewed by regulatory authorities only.

Amendment 1, 14 February 2006. The amendments were implemented before the first patient received their first dose of degarelix/leuprorelin.

The  statistical  analyses  of  the  primary  objective  were  changed,  as  recommended  by  the  FDA  and European authorities, to enable the efficacy of degarelix 240/160 mg and 240/80 mg treatment groups to  be  assessed  separately.  Thus,  two  formal  analyses  were  performed,  one  assessing  the  degarelix response versus a pre-determined threshold of success and one non-inferiority analysis of degarelix versus leuprorelin. The primary objective was changed from:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to

-  To  demonstrate  that  degarelix  is  effective  with  respect  to  achieving  and  maintaining testosterone  to  castrate  levels,  evaluated  as  the  proportion  of  patients  with  testosterone suppression ≤ 0.5 ng/ml during 12 months treatment.

The change in the statistical analysis meant that the number of patients to be screened was increased from 675 to 750 patients to provide 600 instead of 540 randomised patients. A 20% screening failure rate was expected.

The definition of the PP analysis set was modified to exclude patients who:

-  Had a  baseline  PSA  value  &lt;2  ng/ml  for  patients  who  had  not  undergone  prostatectomy  or radiotherapy with curative intention
-  Did not have at least 28 days follow-up (testosterone measurements) after the first dose.

## Amendment 2, also dated 14 February 2006.

This  amendment introduced a MRI sub-study at seven sites  in  France,  Germany,  Romania  and  the Netherlands, in order to evaluate possible changes in tumour size and infiltration into adjacent tissues. This was in compliance with the requirements of the Japanese Society of Clinical Oncology. Patients participating in the MRI investigation had four MRI investigations performed (baseline, Day 28, Day 196 and Day 364) to assess the size of the tumour throughout the course of the study.

## Amendment 3, dated 10 April 2006.

Data on the degarelix IMP were updated to include an extension of drug product shelf-life from 18 months to 24 months when stored below 25 û C,  and  new  stability  data.  In  addition,  the  amendment included other changes to the analytical procedures.

## Amendment 4, dated 25 September 2006.

As part of the assessment of ECG parameters, the list of suspected QT-prolonging drugs prohibited was updated. In addition, there was a change in the method used for recording images in the MRI substudy, to accommodate patient well-being.

## Baseline data

## Demographic profile

The patient demography for the ITT analysis set was presented in a table. Overall, most patients in each treatment group were 65 years of age or older, white, with a body weight of &lt; 90 kg and a BMI &lt; 30 kg/m 2 .

## Disease baseline profile

All patients entering the study had a histological proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate (all stages). Of the 610 patients in the ITT analysis set, 191 (31%) had localized cancer, 178 (29%) had locally advanced cancer, 125 (20%) had metastatic cancer and 116 (19%) had non-classifiable disease, at the time  of  enrolment  (Table  7  below).  Of  the  patients  with  non-classifiable  disease  at  the  time  of enrolment, 35% had previous treatment with curative intent and the remaining could not be classified for  other  reasons  (most  of  these  case  were  because  the  patient's  metastatic  status  could  not  be precisely determined).

-  To  demonstrate  non-inferiority  with  respect  to  the  proportion  of  patients  achieving  and maintaining  testosterone  suppression  to  castrate  levels  using  a  degarelix  dosing  regimen compared to leuprorelin during 12 months treatment.

PCa = prostate cancer.

## Duration of prostate cancer and previous cancer therapy

For the ITT analysis set, the median duration of prostate cancer from diagnosis was 62 days (range: 11days  to  18.1  years).  In  general,  the  history  of  previous  cancer  therapy  was  similar  for  all  three treatment groups. Before enrolling in the study, 37 (6%) patients had undergone radical prostatectomy, 58  (10%)  of  patients  received  radiotherapy,  33  (5%)  had  received  neoadjuvant/adjuvant  hormonal therapy and 11 (2%) had received other therapy for their cancer. The majority of patients (523, 86%) had been followed with watchful waiting.

## Laboratory hormone parameters

For  the  ITT  analysis  set,  the  values  for  efficacy  and  pharmacodynamic  parameters  at  baseline  are shown in table 8 below.

## Ongoing concomitant medications

The profile of concomitant medications was much as expected for this group of elderly patients with histological  proven  adenocarcinoma  of  the  prostate.  The  concomitant  medications  used  were  also consistent  with  many  of  the  patients  having  a  medical  history  of  cardiac  disease  or  hypertension. Prohibited  medications  during  the  study  were  other  hormone-manipulative  drugs  and  medications which  might  prolong  the  QT  interval  and  5α -reductase  inhibitors.  The  pattern  of  use  for  ongoing concomitant medications was similar for the three treatment groups.

## Treatment-emergent concomitant medications

Three hundred and fifty (57%) patients in the ITT analysis set received concomitant medications after starting treatment with IMP. The most frequently used treatment-emergent concomitant medications were  antibacterials  for  systemic  use,  rennin-angiotensin  system  medications,  anti-inflammatory products,  antirheumatic  products  and  analgesics:  The  results  were  presented  in  a  table.  All  other classes  of  treatment  emergent  concomitant  medications  were  used  by  &lt;10%  patients.  With  the exception of anti-androgens, the use of treatment emergent concomitant medications was similar for the three treatment groups.

## Anti-androgen therapy

According  to  the  applicant,  a  total  of  27  (4%)  of  all  patients  received  anti-androgens  as  endocrine therapy: 23 patients treated with leuprorelin and four patients treated with degarelix. Twenty (10%) patients  in  the  leuprorelin  and  the  four  degarelix  patients  received  anti-androgens  as  treatmentemergent  concomitant  medication.  Among  the  patients  treated  with  degarelix,  three  received  antiandrogen (bicalutamide) to treat their prostate cancer and one received anti-androgen to treat his back pain.

The ITT analysis set comprised all patients who received at least one dose of degarelix/ leuprorelin. The primary efficacy endpoint and most of the secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed for both the ITT and PP analysis sets. However, the ITT analysis set was considered primary.

## Per Protocol (PP) analysis set

Of the ITT analysis set, 26 patients had at least one  major protocol deviation and therefore the PP analysis set comprised 584 patients. A further 13 patients were partially excluded from the PP analysis due to major protocol violations which occurred at a post-dose visit: i.e. their data was used in the PP analysis up to the visit at which the protocol violation occurred.

Outcomes and estimation

## Primary efficacy endpoint

The primary endpoint was the probability of testosterone levels ≤ 0.5 from Day 28 to Day 364, and the results for the ITT analysis set are shown in Table 10 and Figure 1. Results for the PP analysis set are shown in Table 11 below.

For patients withdrawn before Day 28, the time to testosterone &gt;0.5 ng/ml was censored at the time from dosing for the last available testosterone measurement. Patients withdrawn between Day 28 and Day 364 (inclusive), with all testosterone measurements ≤ 0.5 ng/ml, were censored at the time from dosing for the last available testosterone measurement. After Day 28, if testosterone values were ≤ 0.5 ng/ml before and after a missing time point, then the missing value was set to ≤ 0.5 ng/ml. If one or both  of  the  testosterone  values  surrounding  a  missing  time  point  was  &gt;0.5  ng/ml,  the  patient  was considered a failure at the first visit where testosterone was &gt;0.5 ng/ml.

In the ITT analysis set, 15 patients had testosterone &gt;0.5 ng/ml (escape) between Day 28 and Day 364 (see  table  12  below).  Of  these,  7  were  in  the  leuprorelin  group:  one  patient  escaped  testosterone suppression  on  Day  56,  three  on  Day  84,  two  on  Day  112  and  one  on  Day  140.  In  the  degarelix 240/160  mg  group,  three  patients  escaped  testosterone  suppression  on  Days  112,  308  and  336, respectively. Five patients in the degarelix 240/80 mg group escaped testosterone suppression on Days 84, 140, 224, 336 and 364, respectively.

## Secondary endpoints

## Proportion of patients with testosterone surge during the first two weeks of treatment

A patient was defined as having a testosterone surge if the testosterone level exceeded baseline by ≥ 15% on any two days during the first two weeks of treatment (i.e. two of Study Days 1, 3, 7 and 14).

In total, there was only one (0.2%) patient treated with degarelix, from the 240/160 mg group, who had a slight testosterone increase during the first two weeks of treatment compared with 161 (80.1%) patients in the leuprorelin group (p&lt;0.0001, Fisher's exact test) (see table 13 below). The testosterone surge experienced by the patient in the degarelix 240/160 mg group can be considered to be an artefact as this patient had a low baseline testosterone value of 0.065 ng/ml.

In the leuprorelin group, among the 22 patients who started anti-androgen therapy before or at Day 7, the proportion of patients who had a testosterone surge during the first two weeks of treatment was 72.7% compared with 80.9% among those patients who did not use anti-androgen therapy.

## Proportion of patients with testosterone level ≤ 0.5 ng/ml at Day 3

On Day 3, there were 392 (95.8%) patients in the pooled degarelix group with testosterone ≤ 0.5 ng/ml compared  with  no  patients  in  the  leuprorelin  group  (see  table  14  below).  Rapid  suppression  of testosterone  was  observed  for  patients  in  the  degarelix  treatment  groups  with  median  testosterone levels  reduced  by  &gt;90%  from  baseline  by  Day  3  (see  figure  2  below).  In  contrast,  patients  in  the leuprorelin group had a 65% increase in testosterone by Day 3.

## Probability of sufficient testosterone response from Day 28 through Day 364

A patient was considered to have insufficient testosterone response if he had one testosterone value &gt;1.0 ng/ml or two consecutive testosterone values &gt;0.5 ng/ml, taken 28 days apart, from Day 28 to Day  364.  This  endpoint  was  designed  to  address  the  issue  of  patients  having  only  one  isolated testosterone value &gt;0.5 ng/ml.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Using  this  less  strict  definition  of  testosterone  response,  the  probability  of  testosterone ≤ 0.5  ng/ml from Day 28 to Day 364 was 98.8%, 97.8% and 96.9% for the degarelix 240/160 mg, degarelix 240/80 mg and leuprorelin groups, respectively. The differences between the two degarelix treatment groups and the leuprorelin comparator group with respect to the probability of patients with testosterone ≤ 0.5 ng/ml from Day 28 to Day 364 were 2.0% (97.5% CI: -1.4 - 5.3) and 0.9% (97.5% CI: -2.8 - 4.7) for the degarelix 240/160 mg and degarelix 240/80 mg treatment groups, respectively. The 97.5% CI for the  difference  in  probability  compared  with  the  leuprorelin  group  remained  greater  than  the  noninferiority limit of -10 percentage points.

## Cumulative probability of testosterone ≤ 0.5 ng/ml from Day 56 through Day 364

The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative probability of testosterone ≤ 0.5 ng/ml from Day 56 to Day 364 were identical to those from Day 28 onwards because no patient had a testosterone value &gt; 0.5 ng/ml (escape) at Day 28.

## Frequency and size of testosterone increases at Day 255 and/or Day 259 compared to the testosterone level at Day 252

Testosterone increases on Day 255 and/or on Day 259 compared with Day 252 were categorised as shifts of ≤ -0.25, &gt; -0.25-0, &gt;0-0.25, &gt;0.25-0.5 and &gt;0.5 ng/ml from mean testosterone levels on Day 252.  Shifts  in  absolute  testosterone  castration  status  were  categorised  as ≤ 0.5  to ≤ 0.5  ng/ml  (no change), ≤ 0.5 to &gt;0.5 ng/ml and &gt;0.5 to ≤ 0.5 ng/ml.

The majority of patients in each treatment group had changes in testosterone within ±0.25 ng/ml on Day 255 and/or on Day 259 compared with testosterone levels on Day 252: 99.4%, 98.3% and 95.5% of  patients  in  the  degarelix  240/160  mg,  degarelix  240/80  mg  and  leuprorelin  groups,  respectively. (see table 15 below). In the leuprorelin group, five patients had testosterone microsurges of 0.25-0.5 ng/ml and three patients had microsurges of &gt;0.5 ng/ml. Five of these patients had previously escaped testosterone suppression. No  testosterone microsurges  were  observed  in  patients treated with degarelix.

Analysis of shifts in absolute testosterone values from Day 252 to Day 255 and/or Day 259 showed that  four  patients  in  the  leuprorelin  group  escaped testosterone suppression (shift from ≤ 0.5 to &gt;0.5 ng/ml). In  addition,  four  patients  treated  with  degarelix  (one  from  the  240/160  mg  group  and  three from the 240/80 mg group) who had escaped testosterone suppression on Day 252 were re-suppressed by Day 255/259.

## Serum testosterone levels over time

Treatment with degarelix resulted in rapid suppression of testosterone levels to ≤ 0.5 ng/ml. By Day 3 median testosterone levels were 0.26 ng/ml and 0.24 ng/ml for the degarelix 240/160 mg and degarelix 240/80 mg treatment groups, respectively. Testosterone levels remained suppressed for both degarelix treatment groups until the end of the study on Day 364. In contrast, treatment with leuprorelin resulted in  an  initial  surge  in  median  testosterone  levels  which  increased  to  6.30  ng/ml  on  Day  3  before dropping to a suppressed level by Day 28, (see Figure 3 below)

## Percentage change in PSA from baseline to Day 14 and Day 28

The PSA levels decreased rapidly following degarelix administration, as shown in the tables 16 and 17 and figure 4 below. On Day 14 and 28 the median percentage change in PSA from baseline in the pooled degarelix groups was -64.3% and -83.6%, respectively. In contrast, in the leuprorelin group the median  percentage  change  in  PSA  from  baseline  was  -17.9%  and  -66.7%  on  Day  14  and  Day  28, respectively.

In  the  leuprorelin  group,  a  greater  median  percentage  change  in  PSA  levels  from  baseline  was observed  for  patients  who  received  anti-androgen  therapy  compared  with  those  who  did  not.  For patients who started anti-androgen therapy on or before Day 7, median PSA levels were reduced by 61.7% on Day 14 and 89.1% on Day 28. In contrast, median PSA levels were only reduced by 15.3% on Day 14 and 61.7% on Day 28 for patients not on anti-androgens.

## Time to PSA failure

The time to PSA failure was defined as the number of days from first dosing (scheduled dosing days) where an increase in serum PSA of ≥ 50% from nadir and a least 5 ng/ml measured on two consecutive occasions at least two weeks apart was noted. The second occasion was the timepoint of meeting the criterion.

The  proportion  of  patients  observed  to  have  PSA  failure  was:  26  (13%)  patients  in  the  degarelix 240/160 mg group, 16 (8%) patients in the degarelix 240/80 mg group, and 26 (13%) patients in the leuprorelin  group.  Approximately  50%  of  PSA  failures  for  each  treatment  group  were  observed  by Day  224  (see  figure  5  below).  The  probability  of  completing  the  study  without  experiencing  PSA failure  on  Day 364 was highest for the degarelix 240/80 mg group (91.1% [95% CI: 85.9-94.5%]). Almost  identical  Day  364  probabilities  for  completing  the  study  without  experiencing  PSA  failure

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were observed for the degarelix 240/160 mg (85.8% [95% CI: 79.8-90.1%]) and leuprorelin (85.9% [95% CI: 79.9-90.2%]) groups.

## Serum PSA levels over time

For patients who received degarelix treatment, PSA levels decreased in a nearly linear rate over time for the pooled degarelix arms, from a median baseline level of 19.9 ng/ml to 0.50-0.70 ng/ml at Day 364. In the leuprorelin group, median PSA levels stayed at a plateau of 17.0-17.6 ng/ml during the first 7 days of treatment, and then decreased in a nearly linear rate over time to a median value of 0.40 ng/ml on Day 364 (see figure 6 below).

## Percentage change in PSA from baseline at Week 12 and at Year One

In  addition  to  the  predefined  secondary  end-points,  an  analysis  of  change  in  PSA  from  baseline  at Week 12 and at Year One was performed and presented in the clinical summary.

There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  in  the  median percentage decrease in PSA (observed cases) at week 12, which ranged from -94.1% to -95.2% across the  groups.  The  median  percentage  decrease  in  PSA  (observed  cases)  at  one  year  was  statistically significantly less (p=0.049) in the 160 mg (40 mg/ml) group (-96.5% [IQR -98.9;-89.2%]) compared to the leuprorelin group (-97.7% [IQR -99.6;-92.2%]), but the difference between the treatments was small  and  not  clinically  relevant.  There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  after  one  year between the two degarelix groups (p=0.11) or between the leuprorelin and the degarelix 80 mg (20 mg/ml) group (p=0.64).

## Serum LH and FSH levels over time

The profiles  for  serum  levels  of  LH  over  time  were  similar  to  those  observed  for  testosterone  (see figure 7 below). Following administration of degarelix, median LH levels decreased rapidly and were &lt;0.7 IU/L on Day 1, a decrease of approximately 88% from baseline. For both degarelix treatment groups median LH levels remained suppressed until the end of the study on Day 364. In contrast, a surge in median LH levels was observed for patients in the leuprorelin group, which peaked at 31.0 IU/L on Day 1 (&gt;400% increase from baseline) before decreasing exponentially to 0.035 IU/L by Day 56 and remaining at this level until Day 364.

A  rapid  decrease  in  FSH  levels  was  also  observed  in  patients  treated  with  degarelix  (see  figure  8 below). Administration of degarelix resulted in a reduction in median FSH levels to ≤ 1.5 IU/L by Day 7, a &gt;80% decrease from baseline. For both degarelix treatment groups median FSH levels remained suppressed until the end of the study on Day 364. For patients in the leuprorelin group there was an initial surge in FSH levels similar to that observed for LH levels which peaked at 22.5 IU/L on Day 1 (146% increase from baseline) before decreasing exponentially to 2.0 IU/L by Day 14. Median FSH subsequently increased around Day 56 to a plateau of approximately 4.40 IU/L and stayed there until Day 364.

## Quality of Life

.

Quality of Life on Days 0, 28, 84, 168 and End of Study

QoL for patients in this study was assessed on Days 0, 28, 84, 168 and at the End of Study Visit using the  Short  Form-12  v2  (SF-12-v2)  and  EORTC  QLQ-C30  questionnaires  to  measure  generic  and cancer-specific QoL, respectively.

For the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, the scores for all three groups were stable. There were no changes from baseline in median scores for all subscales of the questionnaire at any timepoint in the study, except for early end of study. The removal of irregular data from the EORTC QLQ-C30 scores had no effect and all of the values for median changes from baseline remained the same. For the SF-12 v2  questionnaire,  all  scale  scores  were  comparable  across  treatment  groups  and  study  days. Throughout  the  study  there  were  no  changes  from  baseline  scores  in  any  of  the  eight  domains assessed.

## Hot Flush Frequency and Hot Flush Score

The frequency and severity of hot flushes reported by patients was measured using a hot flushes diary. This instrument measured a patient's daily assessment of hot flush frequency and severity (rated on a scale  from  1='mild'  to  4='very  severe')  enabling  calculation  of  a  hot  flush  score.  Analysis  of  the overall  number  of  hot  flushes  per  day  and  hot  flush  score  revealed  no  trend  over  time  or  across treatment groups (see able 18 below). During the course of the study (Days 1-364) the median number of hot flushes per day was very similar between the three treatment groups: 1.00, 1.07 and 1.06 for the degarelix 240/160 mg, degarelix 240/80 mg and leuprorelin groups, respectively. During the course of the  study  (Days  1-364),  the  median  hot  flush  score  per  day  was  slightly  higher  for  the  leuprorelin group  (1.59)  compared  with  the  degarelix  240/160  mg  and  240/80  mg  treatment  groups  (1.46  and 1.37, respectively). Similarly, analysis of the median number of mild and moderate hot flushes per day revealed no trend over time or across treatment groups, and very few patients experienced severe or very severe hot flushes.

## Degarelix concentration during the first month and trough levels at Days 308 and 336

Plasma concentrations of degarelix increased rapidly following administration of the first dose on Day 0. For the pooled degarelix group, the mean maximum plasma concentration of degarelix (C max ) was 61.2 ng/ml, which was observed on Day 1 (24 hours after administration) and the mean AUC 0-28 was 635 .

The mean degarelix trough concentrations were at steady state after 11 and 12 doses of degarelix on Days  308  and  336,  respectively.  For  the  degarelix  240/160  mg  group,  the  mean  degarelix  trough concentration  was  22.1  ng/ml  on  Day  308  which  increased  slightly  to  a  mean  trough  level  of  22.7 ng/ml on Day 336. For the degarelix 240/80 mg, the mean degarelix trough concentration was 13.5 mg/ml on Day 308 and remained steady with a mean trough level of 13.6 ng/ml on Day 336.

## Ancillary analyses

## Sensitivity analyses for the primary end-point

Sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  to  establish  whether  the  conclusions  drawn  from  the  primary analysis of the primary end-point were robust. A Cox-proportional hazard analysis using testosterone monitoring frequency (number of missing testosterone values/ treatment months) as a covariate was added to the sensitivity analysis. The results showed that testosterone monitoring frequency did not have a significant additive effect in the model (p&gt;0.05), therefore its impact on the primary efficacy analysis was negligible.

In  addition,  the  response  rate  to  treatment  (the  proportion  of  patients  with  testosterone ≤ 0.5  ng/ml from Day 28 to Day 364) was analysed using the observed cases, which were defined as patients who either completed the study or had a testosterone measurement of &gt;0.5 ng/ml at Day 28 and onwards. This approach provides a conservative estimate of the response rate at Day 364 because patients with testosterone values ≤ 0.5 ng/ml who withdrew early are not carried forward, and hence the denominator is reduced. Using the observed cases approach, the overall proportion of patients in the ITT analysis set with testosterone ≤ 0.5 ng/ml from Day 28 to Day 364 was 98.2% (95% CI: 94.7-99.6%) for the degarelix  240/160  mg  group  and  97.0%  (95%  CI:  93.2-99.0%) for  the  degarelix  240/80  mg  group, compared with 96.0% (95% CI: 91.8-98.4%) for leuprorelin group. The differences between the two degarelix treatment groups and the leuprorelin comparator group were 2.2% (97.5% CI: -1.4-5.8) and 1.1% (97.5% CI: -2.8-5.0) for the degarelix 240/160 mg and degarelix 240/80 mg treatment groups, respectively.  These  results  are  similar  to  those  obtained  for  the  primary  analysis  using  the  KaplanMeier method.

## Sensitivity analyses for the secondary end-points

Sensitivity analyses were also performed for some of the secondary end-points.

## Proportion of patients with testosterone level ≤ 0.5 ng/ml at Day 3

When analysed by geographical region and weight, the proportion of patients with testosterone ≤ 0.5 ng/ml on Day 3 was similar for each stratum across the treatment groups and ranged from 93% to 100% in the degarelix groups. In the leuprorelin group there were no patients with testosterone ≤ 0.5 ng/ml on Day 3.

## Percentage change in PSA from baseline to Day 14 and Day 28

The median percentage change in PSA from baseline was also analysed by geographical region and weight for each treatment group. For patients in the Americas, degarelix treatment reduced median PSA levels by approximately 60% on Day 14 and 80-84% on Day 28, while treatment with leuprorelin led to smaller reductions in PSA levels of approximately 14% on Day 14 and 56- 59% on Day 28. Similarly, for patients in Central and Eastern Europe, degarelix treatment reduced median PSA levels by  64-67%  on  Day  14  and  80-84%  on  Day  28,  while  treatment  with  leuprorelin  led  to  smaller

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reductions  in  PSA  levels  of  20-25%  on  Day  14  and  59-73%  on  Day  28.  The  number  of  patients recruited  in  Western  Europe  was  too  small  to  make  legitimate  comparisons  with  patients  from  the Americas and, Central and Eastern Europe.

The percentage change in PSA levels from baseline was not affected by the patient's weight.

## Sub-group analysis

Post-hoc  sub-group  analyses  were  presented  in  the  summary  of  clinical  efficacy.  The  efficacy endpoints  were  examined  in  greater  detail  for  differences  among  the  subgroups  of  the  following subpopulations of patients:

-  Age: &lt; 65 years old, ≥ 65 to 75 years old, or ≥ 75 years old.
-  Race: White, Black, or other races.
-  Region: North America, Western Europe, or Central and Eastern Europe and other regions.
-  Stage  of  prostate  cancer:  localized,  locally  advanced,  metastatic,  non-classifiable  in patients with curative intent, non-classifiable in patients without curative intent.
-  Weight: &lt; 70 kg, ≥ 70 to &lt; 90 kg, or ≥ 90 kg.

Overall,  the  results  of  the  subgroup  analyses  for  degarelix  240  mg  (40  mg/ml)/80  mg  (20  mg/ml), degarelix  240  mg  (40  mg/ml)/  160  mg  (40  mg/ml),  and  leuprorelin  were  similar  for  the  primary endpoint.

## Primary efficacy endpoint

Cumulative probability of testosterone ≤ 0.5 ng/ml from Day 28 through Day 364, the results were as follows:

## Age:

The probability ranged from 94.9% [95% CI 87.0;98.1%] to 100% in the degarelix subgroups and from 89.5% [95% CI 74.3;95.9%] to 98.5% [95% CI 89.9;99.8%] in the leuprorelin subgroups.

## Race:

The probability ranged from 95.2% [95% CI 70.7;99.3%] to 100% in the degarelix subgroups and from 95.7% [95% CI 91.3;97.9%] to 100% in the leuprorelin subgroups.

## Region:

The probability ranged from 96.3% [95% CI 90.5;98.6%] to 100% in the degarelix subgroups and from 96.2% [95% CI 90.2;98.6%] to 100% in the leuprorelin subgroups.

## Stage of prostate cancer:

The probability ranged from 92.3% [95% CI 56.6;98.9%] to 100% in the degarelix subgroups and from 95.1% [95% CI 85.5;98.4%] to 100% in the leuprorelin subgroups.

## Weight:

The probability ranged from 93.9% [95% CI 77.9;98.4%] to 100% in the degarelix subgroups and from 95.8% [95% CI 90.3;98.2%] to 97.3% [95% CI 82.3;99.6%] in the leuprorelin subgroups.

It should be noted that there were some discrepancies in the size of the subgroups.

## Secondary endpoints

Sub-group analyses were also performed for some of the secondary endpoints and these analyses showed no discernable trends across the groups.

-  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

No analyses performed across trials were submitted.

-  Clinical studies in special populations

## Hepatically impaired subjects

To investigate the effects of impaired hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics of degarelix, one study has  been  carried  out.  Study  CS23  was  an  open-label,  single  center,  single-dose,  controlled  study conducted  in  three  parallel  groups  of  eight  subjects  each,  two  test  groups  of  subjects  with  hepatic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

diseases (mild or moderate hepatic impairment) and a control group of healthy subjects,. Subjects with a Child-Pugh score ≤ 6, Grade A were in the mild hepatic impairment group and subjects with a ChildPugh  score  7-9,  Grade  B  were  in  the  moderate  hepatic  impairment  group.  The  subjects  were administered one single dose of degarelix (1 mg) as a 1-hour continuous i.v. infusion. Pharmacokinetics for degarelix, pharmacodynamic parameters of testosterone and LH, metabolites of degarelix,  and  safety  parameters  were  monitored  up  to  72  hrs  post-dose  and  at  the  follow-up  visit performed on Day 7.

Both the mild and moderate hepatic impairment groups displayed lower AUC, AUC t , and C max mean values  compared  to  the  healthy  group  of  subjects.  None  of  the  90%  confidence  intervals  fell completely within the 80-125% boundaries, and C max for both the mildly and the moderately impaired, and AUC and AUCt for the moderately impaired, were significantly lower compared to the healthy subjects. In addition, V z for both the mildly and the moderately impaired and CL for the moderately impaired  were  significantly  higher  compared  to  the  healthy  subjects.  There  was  no  relationship between  hepatic  function  and  pharmacokinetic  parameters.  Only  minor  differences  in  excreted metabolites  were  observed  arguing  against  any  major  effect  of  hepatic  impairment  on  degarelix metabolism. Protein binding was approximately 90% in all three groups. No signs of a prolonged halflife  of  degarelix  that  could  result  in  accumulation were observed in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.

Testosterone concentrations decreased subsequent  to degarelix administration with the lowest individual levels recorded 24-36 hrs post dosing in the healthy subjects and in the mild impairment group, and 24-72 hrs post dosing in the moderate impairment group. The lowest mean levels occurred at 24 hours post dosing in the healthy and mild impairment groups and at 36 hours in the moderately impaired  group  (see  figure  9  below).The  lowest  mean  concentrations  of  testosterone  compared  to baseline were similar in the three groups, being 15%, 11%, and 9% of the baseline level in the mild and moderately impaired patients, and in the healthy subjects, respectively. As for testosterone, the LH concentration  decreased  subsequent  to  the  degarelix  administration,  the  minimum  mean  values recorded at 12 hrs post dosing in the healthy subjects and in the mild impairment group, and 36 hrs post dosing in the moderate impairment group.

No supportive studies were provided.

-  Discussion on clinical efficacy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP raised a major objection with regards to the initially proposed indication for degarelix, which  was  subsequently  restricted  to  'treatment  of  patients  with  advanced  hormone-dependent prostate cancer', taking into account that non-inferiority had been investigated using biological criteria and not clinical endpoints indicative of a direct benefit. The studies submitted had not documented tumour reduction or improved overall survival for patients with localized prostate cancer and therefore the  initial  indication  for  degarelix  (treatment  of  patients  with  prostate  cancer  in  whom  androgen deprivation is warranted, including patients with rising PSA after having undergone prostatectomy or radiotherapy)  was  not  considered  acceptable.  Additionally,  the  comparator  in  the  non-inferiority pivotal study (i.e., leuprorelin) had been granted a more restricted indication as compared to inclusion criteria and to the initial claimed indication for FIRMAGON.

The starting  dose  of  degarelix  treatment  is  240mg  administered  as  two  subcutaneous.  injections  of 120mg  each.  The  maintenance  dose  (as  monthly  administrations)  is  of  80mg,  administered  as  one subcutaneous injection.The first maintenance dose should be given one month after the starting dose.

The therapeutic effect of degarelix should be monitored by clinical parameters and prostate specific antigen  (PSA)  serum  levels.  Clinical  studies  showed  that  testosterone  (T)  suppression  occurs immediately  after  administration  of  the  starting  dose  with  96%  of  the  patients  having  plasma testosterone levels corresponding to medical castration (T ≤ 0.5 ng/ml) after three days and 100% after one  month.  Long  term  treatment  with  the  maintenance  dose  up  to  1  year  shows  that  97%  of  the patients  have  sustained  suppressed  testosterone  levels  (T ≤ 0.5  ng/ml).    In  case  the  patient's  clinical response  appears  to  be  sub-optimal,  it  should  be  confirmed  that  serum  testosterone  levels  are remaining  sufficiently  suppressed.  Since  degarelix  does  not  induce  a  testosterone  surge  it  is  not necessary to add an anti-androgen as surge protection at initiation of therapy .

Degarelix should be reconstituted prior to administration, and  only administered subcutaneously, in the  abdominal  region.    Degarelix  should  not  to  be  administered  intravenously.  Intramuscular administration is not recommended either, as it has not been studied. As with other drugs administered by subcutaneous injection, the injection site  should vary periodically.  Injections  should be  given  in areas where the patient will not be exposed to pressure e.g. not close to waistband or belt and not close to the ribs.

There  was  no  need  to  adjust  the  dose  for  the  elderly  or  in  patients  with  mild  or  moderate  liver  or kidney function impairment. A reference to this effect was made in section 5.2 of the SPC. Patients with  severe  liver  or  kidney  impairment  were  not  studied  and  caution  was  therefore  warranted.  A reference to this effect was made in section 4.4 of the SPC. There was no relevant indication for use of degarelix in women ,children and adolescents

## Clinical safety

-  Patient exposure

A total of 1836 prostate cancer patients and 138 healthy subjects were treated with degarelix. Of these, 1148 patients have received degarelix for more than one year, including 171 on the dosing regimen of 240 mg/80 mg.

As of September 28, 2007, 132 patients received degarelix for the first time in the extension study CS21A after receiving leuprorelin 7.5 mg.

Overall,  at  enrolment,  the  demographic  and  baseline  disease  characteristics  of  the  pivotal  study population were very similar to that of the total degarelix population, and within CS21 the treatment groups were well balanced:

- -mean age was 72 years, 82% were  &gt; 65 years and 42% were  &gt; 75 years.
- -87% were Caucasian patients
- -42% from Central and Eastern Europe/Other, 34% from North America, and 24% from Western Europe.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -61% localized or locally advanced prostate cancer, 22% metastatic prostate cancer,
- -Approximately 14% had treatment of a curative intent.
- -55% patients had a Gleason score of 7-10
- -80% patients were fully active as rated on the ECOG performance scale.
- -The mean duration of prostate cancer from diagnosis was 1.3 years (range: 0.014 to 18.3 years).

Many patients had concurrent medical conditions and were receiving concomitant medications. In all studies  patients  receiving  other  concurrent  drugs  with  anti-androgenic  or  estrogenic  activity  for  the management of their prostate cancer were excluded. In the pivotal study, medications which might prolong the QT/QTcF interval were prohibited.

Of the 178 patients in the leuprorelin group, only 22 patients were given anti-androgens within 7 days of  the  first  dosing.  The  majority  of  these  patients  (19/22)  received  anti-androgens  for ≤ 28  days suggesting that anti-androgen therapy was administered as flare protection, although prophylaxis of flare  was  only  recorded  in  the  eCRF/data  listings  for  four  of  these  patients.  A  similar  number  of patients in the Americas and Central and Eastern Europe received anti-androgens.

## Treatment Emergent Adverse Events

In the Phase 3 control study CS21, comparable proportions of patients in each of the treatment groups reported TEAEs: 81% degarelix and 78% leuprorelin.

Globally, the most common TEAEs observed with degarelix were: hot flush (26%), injection site pain (29%),  injection  site  erythema  (21%),  back  pain  (7%),  fatigue  (5%),  nasopharyngitis  (7%),  weight increased  (7%),  urinary  tract  infection  (6%),  arthralgia  (6%),  ALT  increased  (6%),  dizziness  (6%), constipation (5.5%), hypertension (5.3%), and diarrhoea (5.3%).

There  was  a statistically significant difference in favour of degarelix for the incidence of: musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders,  Reproductive  system  and  breast  disorders,  urinary tract infection, arthralgia, oedema peripheral, erectile dysfunction, chest pain, Cystitis non infective, cardiac  murmur,  musculoskeletal  stiffness,  libido  decreased,  deep  vein  thrombosis,  myocardial ischaemia. In contrast, there was a highly statistically significant difference in favour of leuprorelin for the incidence of Injection site reactions, Influenza like illness, chills.

## Adverse Drug Reactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were 57% of degarelix patients with drug-related adverse events (adverse drug reactions). This was comparable to the percentage seen in the Phase 3 active control study for degarelix (58%) and more  than  that  seen  for  leuprorelin  (42%).  The  overall  lower  incidence  of  ADRs  for  leuprorelin compared to degarelix is due to the higher incidence of injection site reactions reported for degarelix.

In CS21 study, a greater proportion of patients in the degarelix dose groups had injection site reactions considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug compared to the leuprorelin group.

A greater  proportion  of  patients  treated  with  leuprorelin  had  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue disorders and reproductive system and breast disorders such as erectile dysfunction considered related to treatment compared to degarelix treated patients in the CS21 study.

Of the 14 common AEs in degarelix patients, six of the AEs were also judged as related to degarelix by the investigator: hot flush (31%), injection site pain (17%), injection site erythema (11%), fatigue (5%), weight increased (4%), and ALT increased (4%).

Excluding  injection-site  ADRs,  the  incidences  of  the  remaining  ADRs  were  similar  in  the  three treatment groups:

- 44% patients reported 194 ADRs, in the degarelix 240/160 mg group
- 43% patients reported 216 ADRs in the degarelix 240/80 mg group
- 42% patients reported 142 ADRs in the leuprorelin 7.5 mg group.

These limited results suggest that both the degarelix maintenance doses (80@20 mg/mL or 160@40 mg/ml) resulted in a similar incidence of ADRs.

## Reactions due to androgen deprivation

Expected reactions occurring from androgen deprivation include hot flushes, weight increase, fatigue and adverse events relating to the reproductive system such as erectile dysfunction, testicular atrophy, and gynecomastia.

Adverse events relating to the reproductive system were reported at a low incidence in both treatment groups (&lt;4%) in the Phase 3 active control study and &lt;2% for total degarelix in the Phase 2/3 onemonth dosing regimen studies.

The incidence of hot flush and weight increase were comparable between degarelix and leuprorelin groups:

- -The incidence of hot flush with degarelix decreased after Month 1 (Month 1:15%, Month 2-4: 8%, Month 5-7: 3%, Month 8-10: 3%, Month 11-13: 1%) and after Month 2-4 with leuprorelin (8%, 12%,  1%,  2%,  2%,  respectively).  The  increase  of  the  hot  flush  incidence  after  Month  1  for leuprorelin is most likely related to the delay in testosterone suppression.
- -The consistency over time in the hot flush prevalence suggests that the duration of the event was long for most patients who experienced this event.
- -Incidence of weight increase was greatest at the end for both degarelix and leuprorelin.

## Local Tolerability: Injection site reactions

In the Phase 3 active control study, 40% of all degarelix patients (N=194) reported an injection site reaction,  while  only  one  leuprorelin  patient  reported  an  injection  site  reaction.  There  were  a numerically greater percentage of patients reporting injection site erythema and injection site nodule in the 240 mg/160 mg group compared to the 240 mg/80 mg group, suggesting that the maintenance dose of 80mg may result in fewer injections site reactions.

The most frequently reported TEAEs in the degarelix 240mg/80mg group were injection site reactions, including  pain  (28%),  erythema  (17%),  swelling  (6%),  induration  (4%),  and  nodule  (3%).    These adverse events were mostly transient of mild to moderate intensity. The events occurred primarily with the starting dose (32% of patients), whereas few injection site reactions (3% of patients) were reported

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with  administration  of  each  maintenance  dose.    Very  few  injection  site  reactions  (&lt;1%)  led  to discontinuation.  The incidence rates of these events per 100 injections were: injection site pain 2.8, injection site erythema 1.6, injection site swelling 0.5, injection site induration 0.3, and injection site nodule 0.2.

In  many  cases,  two  or  more  injection  site  reactions  occurred  simultaneously  after  dosing.  The incidence  of  injection  site  pain  and  injection  site  erythema  decreased  after  Month  1  for  degarelix. None  of  the  injection site  reactions  were  considered  to  be  SAEs,  and  no  immediate  onset hypersensitivity reactions occurred after dosing.

Injection site reactions were rarely observed with leuprorelin in the pivotal study.  Since a high rate of injection site reactions are associated with leuprorelin administered S.C., the applicant suggested that the difference in the route of administration would be the primary reason for the difference in local tolerability of leuprorelin versus S.C. degarelix.

## Immunological events

No cases of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions related to degarelix were identified using MedDRA SMQs for 'anaphylaxis', 'angioedema', or 'severe cutaneous skin reactions'.  In the CS21 study, there was a low incidence of other adverse events associated with hypersensitivity reactions for degarelix 20mg/ 80 mg, such as rash (&lt;1%) and pruritus (&lt;1%), and no clinically relevant differences observed when compared to leuprorelin.

##  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

There  were  18%  of  patients  treated  with  degarelix  who  had  serious  adverse  events  and  5%  of  the patients died; this was comparable to what was seen for leuprorelin in the Phase 3 active control study.

In the Phase 3 active control study, the incidence of SAEs was comparable between treatment groups: 11% degarelix and 14% leuprorelin. Death during treatment and within 30 days after  the  last  dose occurred in 2.4% of the degarelix patients (10 deaths) compared to 4.5% of the leuprorelin group (9 deaths).

The  most  common  SAEs  were  cardiac  disorders  (2%  degarelix  and  5%  leuprorelin)  and  renal  and urinary disorders (2% degarelix and 3% leuprorelin). None of the SAEs were considered related to study  drug  except  for  abnormal  prostate  examination  experienced  by  one  patient  in  the  leuprorelin group.

The causes of death were similar among the treatment groups (cardiac disorders, malignancies), and none was considered related to treatment.

The incidence  of  discontinuation  for  each  treatment  group  in  the  Phase  3  active  control  study  was stable over time (9% first six months vs. 11% last six month of the study) for any reason.

## Cardiovascular events

Androgen deprivation therapy has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in older  men.  Given  the  prevalence  of  cardiovascular  disorders  in  the  population  of  elderly  men,  an analysis  of  the  effect  of  exposure  to  degarelix  on  the  incidence  of  cardiovascular  events  was undertaken.

In  the  Phase  3  active  control  study,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  markedly  abnormal  changes  in ECG  variables  was  comparable  between  degarelix  and  leuprorelin.  There  were  no  dose  related changes noted. Approximately 20% of patients had markedly abnormal increases in QTc Fridericia of &gt; 450 msec with 3% having increases &gt; 480 msec. Seven patients, 3 in the pooled degarelix group and 4 in the leuprorelin group, had a markedly abnormal QTcF ≥ 500 msec. None of the degarelix patients with  QTcF ≥ 500  msec  had  outcomes  of  syncope,  Torsade  de  pointes,  ventricular  fibrillation,  or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sudden death. There was one leuprorelin patient with a cardiovascular history, who reported syncope and cardiac arrhythmia 20 days after a QTc measurement of 503 msec. This patient also had a prior episode of syncope 4 months earlier. All three events were rated as Grade 2 (moderate) and considered related to study drug leuprorelin. The patient continued in the study.

##  Laboratory findings

In  the  Phase  3  study,  a  decrease  in  haemoglobin  was  observed  in  40%  patients  in  the  degarelix 240 mg/ 80 mg and in 36% patients in the leuprorelin group.  Two patients in the degarelix group and three in the leuprorelin group had anaemia that was considered serious. Overall, 8 degarelix patients in the one-month dosing regimen studies had anaemia reported as a serious adverse event.

No patients  were  discontinued  due  to  a  clinically  significant  haematology  abnormality,  except  one degarelix patient, who developed neutropenic sepsis (SAE) in study CS07A, 6 weeks after his second dose, which led to discontinuation; otherwise, no adverse trends in decreased neutrophil counts were identified in patients exposed to degarelix.

In the pivotal study, there were no unexpected observable trends across the treatment groups in clinical chemistry parameters.  The abnormal values for urea nitrogen, potassium, and serum creatinine were mainly in patients with pre-existing renal abnormalities, but were not clinically significant and were reported for both degarelix and leuprorelin.

Regarding  liver  toxicity,  more  patients  in  the  degarelix  240 mg/  80 mg  group  had  increased  ALT compared with the leuprorelin group in the pivotal study (10% and 5%, respectively). Increased AST and hypercholesterolemia occurred in 5% and 3% of degarelix 240 mg/ 80 mg patients (3% and 2%, respectively leuprorelin), and gamma-GT in 2% of degarelix 240 mg/ 80 mg patients (1% leuprorelin) were  also  reported.    One  patient  in  the  degarelix  240/80  mg  group,  with  elevated  gamma-GT  at baseline, was discontinued due to the AE of hepatic enzyme increase.

Overall in the phase 2/3 one-month dosing regimen studies, fewer than 1% of patients had laboratory value  abnormalities  reported  as  SAEs:  haematuria  (n  =  7,  &lt;1%)  was  the  most  commonly  reported serious  adverse  event.    There  were  very  few  (&lt;1%)  patients  withdrawn  from  treatment  due  to laboratory abnormalities: 4 patients discontinued due to increased ALT, 3 patients due to increased gamma-GT, and 2 patients due to increased alkaline phosphatase.

##  Safety in special populations

Degarelix  was  studied  in  a  pharmacokinetic  study  CS23  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  hepatic impairment.  No  signs  of  increased  exposure  in  the  hepatically  impaired  patients  were  observed compared  to  healthy  subjects.  No  shifts  in  liver  function  tests  were  observed  24  hours  post-dose compared  to  baseline  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment.    Dose  adjustment  is  not  necessary  in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic dysfunction have not been studied and caution is therefore warranted in this group

Because  only  a  relatively  small  amount  of  degarelix  is  excreted  unchanged  via  the  kidneys,  dose adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, but degarelix should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment due to lack of data to support its use.

##  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

The only prohibited medications during these studies were other hormone-manipulative drugs, and, in CS21, those which might prolong the QT interval and 5α -reductase inhibitors. Therefore, during the clinical study program, the use of concomitant medication in the study populations has been extensive, without  evidence  of  any  impact  on  the  therapeutic  effect  or  safety  of  either  degarelix  or  the concomitant treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Although  anti-arrhythmic  drugs  are  not  contra-indicated,  physicians  should  consider  whether  the benefit of androgen deprivation treatment outweighs the potential risk to patients who are taking these medications.

Since androgen deprivation treatment may prolong QTc interval, careful consideration should be given to  patients  receiving  Class  IA  (e.g.  quinidine,  procainamide)  or  Class  III  (e.g.  amiodarone,  sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications.

No  studies  on  the  effects  of  degarelix  on  the  ability  to  drive  and  operate  machinery  have  been performed,  but  it  is  not  associated  with  drowsiness  and  should  not  affect  a  patient's  ability  in  this respect.

##  Discontinuation due to adverse events

For the Phase 3 active control study, the percentage of patients completing the study was comparable between  the  degarelix  groups  (81%)  and  the  leuprorelin  group  (86%).  The  incidence  of  non-fatal adverse events leading to discontinuation for the degarelix groups was 5.8% for degarelix compared to 1.5% in the leuprorelin group.

In the total degarelix treatment group, of the 34 AEs that led to withdrawal, 11 of these were ADRs. In comparison, all AEs leading to withdrawal in the leuprorelin group were considered unrelated to the IMP.  The table below summarizes the disposition of patients in phase 2/3 studies for degarelix one month dosing regimen.

##  Post marketing experience

There is no post-marketing experience with degarelix as this product has not been previously authorised.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Discussion on clinical safety

Since no post-marketing studies were proposed by the applicant, considering the very limited safety data  base  for  degarelix,  the  applicant  was  asked  to  commit  to  continue  the  ongoing  long  term extension  studies  for  the  one  month  depot  (CS12A,  CS14A  and  CS21A)  independently  of  MA approval. The applicant agreed to commit to continue these studies until all patients in the given study had received treatment with degarelix for a period of 5 years.

The CHMP raised concerns over the long term efficacy and safety for patients developing antibodies against  degarelix,  as  this  matter  had  not  been  fully  investigated.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  asked  the applicant  to  explore  the  long  term  consequences  of  developing  anti-degarelix  antibodies,  providing literature concerning antibody formation after GNRH agonist treatment.  In addition, the information on section 5.1 of the SPC on antibody formation was updated to reflect that long term efficacy and safety data in relation to antibody  development  was  not  available: 'Anti-degarelix antibody development has been observed in 10% of patients after treatment with FIRMAGON for one year. There is no indication that the efficacy or safety of FIRMAGON treatment is affected by antibody formation after one year of treatment. Efficacy and safety data in relation to antibody development beyond one year is not available.'

The CHMP considered that section 4.4 of the SPC should include a warning with regards to the lack of new data (efficacy and safety) beyond one year from Study CS21 ('the data available on clinical and safety  experience  with  degarelix  is  limited  to  one  year  treatment.')  In  addition,  warnings  were included  on  the  effect  of  degarelix  on  QT/QTc  interval,  patients  with  known  or  suspect  hepatic disorders,  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment,  severe  untreated  asthma,  anaphylactic  reactions, severe  urticaria,  angioedema,  or  patients  with  orchiectomy  or  who  have  been  treated  with  a  GnRH agonist.

## Effect on QT/QTc interval

During the evaluation, the CHMP considered that the original warning submitted by the applicant was insufficient as clinical and pre-clinical data should be mentioned in the SPC. The applicant argued that the  use  of  androgen  deprivation  therapy  was  not  considered  an  absolute  contraindication  (hence  no mention of it in section 4.3) in the patient population excluded from the pivotal study CS21 based on risk factors related tot the QT interval. However, the applicant and the CHMP agreed to update section 4.4 with information on the clinical data as follows:

Long-term  androgen  deprivation  therapy  may  prolong  the  QT  interval.  In  the  confirmatory  study comparing degarelix to leuprorelin periodic, both therapies showed QT/QTc intervals exceeding 450 msec in approximately 20% of the patients, and 500 msec in 1-2% of the patients. A reference to this effect was also made in section 5.1.

Degarelix  has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  a  history  of  a  corrected  QT  interval  over  450  ms, history of or risk factors for torsades de pointes; concomitant medications that might prolong the QT interval.  Therefore    the  CHMP  considered  that,  in  such  patients,  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of  degarelix should be thoroughly appraised. References to this effect were also made in  sections 4.5 and 4.8 of the SPC.

In  addition  to  this,  the  Clinical  Evaluation  of  QT/QTc  Interval  Prolongation  and  Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrythmic Drugs' ICH guideline (CHMP/ICH/2/04) recommends that all new compounds  with  systemic  bioavailability  undergo  a  'thorough  QT/QTc'  study  to  determine  if  the compound (or  its  metabolites)  causes  prolongation  of  the  QT  interval.  These  recommendations  are primarily concerned with the development of New Chemical Entities; however, the CHMP considered that  it  may  be  applicable  to  approved  drugs  when  a  new  dose  or  route  of  administration  is  being developed. Following this recommendation,  the applicant committed to perform a QT/QC study and update the risk management plan accordingly.

## Hepatic impairment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients with known or suspected hepatic disorder have not been included in long-term clinical trials with degarelix. Mild, transient increases in ALT and AST has been seen, these were not accompanied by a rise  in  bilirubin  or  clinical  symptoms.  Monitoring  of  liver  function  in  patients  with  known  or suspected hepatic disorder is advised during treatment. The pharmacokinetics of degarelix has been investigated  after  single  intravenous  administration  in  subjects  with  mild  to  moderate  hepatic impairment. A reference to this effect was also made in section 5.2 of the SPC.

## Renal impairment

Degarelix  has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  and  caution  is  therefore warranted.

## Hypersensitivity

Degarelix  has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  a  history  of  severe  untreated  asthma,  anaphylactic reactions or severe urticaria or angioedema.

## Changes in bone density

The CHMP considered that the applicant had not adequately justified why a similar long term effect on  decreased  bone  density  between  degarelix  and  other  androgen  deprivation  therapies  may  be expected.  The  applicant  provided  references  to  this  respect,  suggesting  that  bone  mass  density continues  to  decrease  during  long-term  treatment  with  GnRH  agonists  and  the  development  of osteoporosis appears to increase steadily with duration of therapy. Therefore the SPC was amended as follows:  Decreased  bone  density  has  been  reported  in  the  medical  literature  in  men  who  have  had orchiectomy or who have been treated with a GnRH agonist. It can be anticipated that long periods of testosterone  suppression  in  men  will  have  effects  on  bone  density.  Bone  density  has  not  been measured during treatment with degarelix.

## Glucose tolerance

The  CHMP  noted  the  need  to  include  a  warning  regarding  reduced  glucose  tolerance  related  to androgen deprivation. This warning was further updated to include information that the influence of degarelix on insulin and glucose levels has not been studied: A reduction in glucose tolerance has been observed  in  men  who  have  had  orchiectomy  or  who  have  been  treated  with  a  GnRH  agonist. Development  or  aggravation  of  diabetes  may  occur;  therefore  diabetic  patients  may  require  more frequent  monitoring  of  blood  glucose  when  receiving  androgen  deprivation  therapy.  The  effect  of degarelix on insulin and glucose levels has not been studied.

In  section  4.7,  the  absence  of  studies  on  the  effects  of  degarelix  on  the  ability  to  drive  and  use machines was stated. However, the CHMP considered that fatigue and dizziness are common adverse reactions that might influence the patient's ability to drive and use machines.

Section 4.8 was amended to include the  most commonly observed adverse reactions during degarelix therapy in the confirmatory phase III study, which were due to the expected physiological effects of testosterone  suppression,  including  hot  flushes  and  weight  increase  (reported  in  25%  and  7%, respectively, of patients receiving treatment for one year), or injection site adverse events. Transient chills, fever or influenza like illness were reported to occur hours after dosing (in 3%, 2% and 1% of patients, respectively).

The injection site adverse events reported were mainly pain and erythema, reported in 28% and 17% of  patients,  respectively,  less  frequently  reported  were  swelling  (6%),  induration  (4%)  and  nodule (3%). These events occurred primarily with the starting dose whereas during maintenance therapy the incidence of these events pr 100 injections was: 3 for pain and &lt;1 for erythema, swelling, nodule and induration. The reported events were mostly transient, of mild to moderate intensity and led to very few discontinuations (&lt;1%).

The frequency of undesirable effects reported in the confirmatory phase II study was provided in a tabular format in the SPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Changes in laboratory parameters:

Changes in laboratory values seen during one year of treatment were in the same range for degarelix and  the  GnRH-agonist  (leuprorelin)  used  as  comparator.  Markedly  abnormal  (&gt;3*ULN)  liver transaminase values (ALT, AST and GGT) were seen in 2-6% of patients with normal values prior to treatment, following treatment with both drugs. Marked decrease in haematological values, hematocrit ( ≤ 0.37)  and  hemoglobin  ( ≤ 115g/l)  were  seen  in  40%  and  13-15%,  respectively,  of  patients  with normal values prior to treatment, following treatment with both drugs. It is unknown to what extent this  decrease  in  haematological  values  was  caused  by  the  underlying  prostate  cancer  and  to  what extent it was a consequence of androgen deprivation therapy.

In  addition,    the  CHMP  requested  that  the  proportion  of  patients  with  abnormal  values  for  urea nitrogen,  potassium,  and  creatininie  be  included  in  this  section:  Markedly  abnormal  values  of potassium ( ≥ 5.8mmol/L), creatinine ( ≥ 177 μ mol/L) and BUN ( ≥ 10.7mmol/L) in patients with normal values prior to treatment, were seen in 6%, 2% and 15% of degarelix treated patients and 3%, 2% and 14% of leuprorelin treated patients, respectively.

## Changes in ECG measurements:

Changes in ECG measurements seen during one year of treatment were in the same range for degarelix and  the  GnRH-agonist  (leuprorelin)  used  as  comparator.  Three  (&lt;1%)  out  of  409  patients  in  the degarelix group and four (2%)out of 207? patients in the leuprorelin 7.5 mg group, had a QTcF ≥ 500 msec.  From baseline to end of study the median change in QTcF for degarelix was 12.3 msec and for leuprorelin was 16.7 msec.

Section  4.9  was  updated  to  reflect  that  there  is  no  clinical  experience  with  the  effects  of  an  acute overdose with degarelix. In the event of an overdose, the CHMP recommended that the patient should be monitored and appropriate supportive treatment should be given, if considered necessary.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the MA application is of the opinion that the following risk minimisation activities are necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product: see as detailed in section 2.3 of this CHMP Assessment Report.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The  drug  substance  and  the  drug  product  have  been  appropriately  characterised  and  generally satisfactory  documentation  has  been  provided.  The  excipients  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  drug product and manufacturing process selected are typical for injectable preparations. The results indicate that the drug substance and the drug product can be reproducibly manufactured.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were minor unresolved quality issues which have no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve it as a Follow-up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed time-frame.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Animal reproduction studies showed that degarelix caused infertility in male animals. This is due to the pharmacological effect; and the effect was reversible.

In female reproduction toxicity studies degarelix revealed findings expected from the pharmacological properties.  It  caused  a  dosage  dependent  prolongation  of  the  time  to  mating  and  to  pregnancy,  a reduced number of corpora lutea , and an increase in the number of pre- and post-implantation losses, abortions, early embryo/foetal deaths, premature deliveries and in the duration of parturition.

Preclinical  studies  on  safety  pharmacology,  repeated  dose  toxicity,  genotoxicity,  and  carcinogenic potential revealed no special hazard for humans. Especially, both in vitro and in vivo studies showed no signs of QT prolongation.

No target organ toxicity was observed from acute, subacute and chronic toxicity studies in rats and monkeys following subcutaneous administration of degarelix. Drug-related local irritation was noted in animals when degarelix was administered subcutaneously in high doses.

## Efficacy

The  data  submitted  suggest  that  a  single  dose  of  240 mg  degarelix,  followed  by  a  monthly maintenance  dose  of  80 mg,  rapidly  causes  a  decrease  in  the  concentrations  of  LH,  FSH  and subsequently  testosterone.  The  plasma  concentration  of  dihydrotestosterone  (DHT)  decreases  in  a similar manner to testosterone.

The efficacy and safety of degarelix were evaluated in an open-label, multi-centre, randomised, active comparator controlled, parallel-group phase III study. The study investigated the efficacy and safety of two different degarelix monthly dosing regimens with a starting dose of 240 mg (40 mg/ml) followed by monthly doses subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of 160 mg (40 mg/ml) or 80 mg (20 mg/ml), in comparison  to  monthly  intramuscular  (i.m)  administration  of  7.5  mg  leuprorelin  in  patients  with prostate cancer requiring androgen deprivation therapy. In total 620 patients were randomised to one of  the  three  treatment  groups,  of  which  504  (81%)  patients  completed  the  study.  In  the  degarelix 240/80 mg  treatment  group  41  (20%)  patients  discontinued  the  study,  as  compared  to  32  (16%) patients in the leuprorelin group.

Of the 610 patients treated

-  31% had localised prostate cancer
-  29% had locally advanced prostate cancer
-  20 % had metastatic prostate cancer
-  7% had an unknown metastatic status
-  13% had previous curative intent surgery or radiation and a rising PSA

Baseline demographics were similar between the arms. The median age was 74 years (range 47 to 98 years). The primary objective was to demonstrate that degarelix is effective with respect to achieving

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and  maintaining  testosterone  suppression  to  below  0.5  ng/ml,  during  12  months  of  treatment.  The lowest effective maintenance dose of 80 mg degarelix was chosen.

## Attainment of serum Testosterone (T) ≤ 0.5 ng/ml:

A table showing the percentage of patients attaining testosterone levels of ≤ 0.5  ng/ml  after  start  of treatment  with  degarelix  and  leuprorelin  was  included  in  the  SPC.  Degarelix  was  effective  in achieving testosterone suppression well below the medical castration level of 0.5 ng/ml.

## Avoidance of testosterone surge:

## Surge was defined as testosterone exceeding baseline by ≥ 15% within the first 2 weeks.

None of the degarelix-treated patients experienced a testosterone surge; there was an average decrease of  94%  in  testosterone  at  day  3.  Most  of  the  leuprorelin-treated  patients  experienced  testosterone surge; there was an average increase of 65% in testosterone at day 3. This difference was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001).

A graph depicting the percentage change in testosterone from baseline by treatment group until day 28 (median with interquartile ranges) was included in the SPC. The primary end-point in the study was testosterone suppression rates after one year of treatment with degarelix or leuprorelin. The clinical benefit for degarelix compared to leuprorelin plus anti-androgen in the initial phase of treatment was not demonstrated.

## Long-term effect:

Successful  response  in  the  study  was  defined  as  attainment  of  medical  castration  at  day  28  and maintenance through day 364 where no single testosterone concentration was greater than 0.5 ng/ml. A table showing the cumulative probability of attaining medical castration from Day 28 to Day 364 was  included  in  the  SPC.  Degarelix  showed  a  response  rate  of  97.2%  (CI:  93,5;  98.8%)  and leuprorelin showed a response rate of 96.4% (CI: 992.5; 98.2%)

## Attainment of prostate specific antigen (PSA) reduction:

Tumour size was not measured directly during the clinical trial programme, but there was an indirect beneficial  tumour  response  as  shown  by  a  95%  reduction  after  12  months  in  median  PSA  for degarelix.

The median PSA in the study at baseline was:

-  for  the  degarelix  240/80 mg treatment group 19.8 ng/ml (interquartile range: P25 9.4 ng/mL, P75 46.4 ng/ml)
-  for the leuprorelin 7.5 mg treatment group 17.4 ng/ml (interquartile range: P25 8.4 ng/mL, P75 56.5 ng/ml)

A  graph  depicting  the  percentage  change  in  PSA  from  baseline  by  treatment  group  until  day  56 (median  with  interquartile  ranges)  was  included  in  the  SPC  showing  a  statistically  significant difference (p&lt;0.001) at the pre-specified analysis at day 14 and day 28.

Prostate  specific  antigen  (PSA)  levels  are  lowered  by  64%  two  weeks  after  administration  of degarelix,  85%  after  one  month,  95%  after  three  months,  and  remained  suppressed  (approximately 97%) throughout the one year of treatment.

From day 56 to day 364 there were no significant differences between degarelix and the comparator in the percentage change from baseline.

In  the  confirmatory  study  comparing  FIRMAGON  to  leuprorelin  periodic  electrocardiograms  were performed. Both therapies showed QT/QTc intervals exceeding 450 msec in approximately 20% of the patients. From baseline to end of study the median change for FIRMAGON was 12.3 msec (3.2%) and for leuprorelin was 16.7 msec (3.5%).

Anti-degarelix antibody development was observed in 10% of patients after treatment with degarelix for one year. There was no indication that the efficacy or safety of degarelix treatment is affected by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

antibody  formation  after  one  year  of  treatment.  However,  efficacy  and  safety  data  in  relation  to antibody development beyond one year is not available.

## Safety

The most commonly observed adverse reactions during degarelix therapy in the confirmatory phase III study (N=409) were due to the expected physiological effects of testosterone suppression, including hot flushes and weight increase (reported in 25% and 7%, respectively, of patients receiving treatment for  one  year),  or  injection  site  adverse  events.  Transient  chills,  fever  or  influenza  like  illness  were reported to occur hours after dosing (in 3%, 2% and 1% of patients, respectively).

The injection site adverse events reported were mainly pain and erythema, reported in 28% and 17% of  patients,  respectively,  less  frequently  reported  were  swelling  (6%),  induration  (4%)  and  nodule (3%). These events occurred primarily with the starting dose whereas during maintenance therapy the incidence of these events pr 100 injections was: 3 for pain and &lt;1 for erythema, swelling, nodule and induration. The reported events were mostly transient, of mild to moderate intensity and led to very few discontinuations (&lt;1%).The frequency of adverse drug reactions reported in confirmatory phase III study was included in the SmPC.

Changes in laboratory values seen during one year of treatment were in the same range for degarelix and  the  GnRH-agonist  (leuprorelin)  used  as  comparator.  Markedly  abnormal  (&gt;3*ULN)  liver transaminase values (ALT, AST and GGT) were seen in 2-6% of patients with normal values prior to treatment, following treatment with both drugs. Marked decrease in haematological values, hematocrit ( ≤ 0.37)  and  hemoglobin  ( ≤ 115g/l)  were  seen  in  40%  and  13-15%,  respectively,  of  patients  with normal values prior to treatment, following treatment with both drugs. It is unknown to what extent this  decrease  in  haematological  values  was  caused  by  the  underlying  prostate  cancer  and  to  what extent it was a consequence of androgen deprivation therapy. Markedly abnormal values of potassium ( ≥ 5.8mmol/L), creatinine ( ≥ 177 μ mol/L) and BUN ( ≥ 10.7mmol/L) in patients with normal values prior to  treatment,  were  seen  in  6%,  2%  and  15%  of  degarelix  treated  patients  and  3%,  2%  and  14%  of leuprorelin treated patients, respectively.

Changes in ECG measurements seen during one year of treatment were in the same range for degarelix and  the  GnRH-agonist  (leuprorelin)  used  as  comparator.  Three  (&lt;1%)  out  of  409  patients  in  the degarelix group and four (2%)out of 207? patients in the leuprorelin 7.5 mg group, had a QTcF ≥ 500 msec.  From baseline to end of study the median change in QTcF for degarelix was 12.3 msec and for leuprorelin was 16.7 msec.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials &lt;and post-marketing&gt; have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

## Risk-benefit assessment

## Advanced Hormone-Dependent Prostate Cancer

Degarelix is  a  GnRH  receptor  blocker,  intended  initially  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  prostate cancer  in  whom  androgen  deprivation  is  warranted  which  includes  patients  with  rising  PSA  after having undergone prostatectomy or radiotherapy.

Degarelix was shown to achieve and maintain a castrate level of testosterone ≤ 0.5 ng/ml throughout the 12-month treatment period without an initial surge in testosterone. Degarelix also demonstrated to be non-inferior to  the active comparator, leuprorelin. Therefore, degarelix was considered to be an effective  treatment,  and  could  be  approved  for  patients  with  advanced  prostate  cancer.  The  major clinical added value of this medicinal product was the avoidance of the testosterone flare seen with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

GnRH agonists (in other words, no need for concomitant anti-androgen therapy), and degarelix is thus especially useful when a rapid reduction in the testosterone levels is of critical importance.

The  product  is  now  intended  for  treatment  of  patients  with  advanced  hormone-dependent  prostate cancer. This indication was restricted following the major objection raised by the CHMP. The first claimed  indication  for  degarelix  was  not  acceptable  since  the  applicant  did  not  document  tumour reduction or improved overall survival for patients with localized prostate cancer. In addition, no new data  beyond  one  year  from  the  pivotal  phase  III  study,  CS21A,  were  provided  by  the  applicant. Therefore the SPC was updated to clearly mention that clinical experience is limited to one year.

-  User consultation

The Package Leaflet (PIL) for FIRMAGON has been tested in English in accordance with Articles 59(3)  and  61(1)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended  by  Directive  2004/27/EC.  The  Patient Information Leaflet for FIRMAGON was found to contain all the necessary information in a way that is accessible and understandable to those who participated in this test.

It is considered that the tested PIL meets the requirements set for User Testing.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns and the following additional risk minimisation activities were required: see as detailed in section   2.5.

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of FIRMAGON in the treatment of 'FIRMAGON is a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist indicated for treatment of adult male patients with advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer' was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
