## 1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PROCEDURE

## 1.1 Submission of the dossier

The  applicant  Novartis  Europharm  Ltd.  submitted  on  4  July  2008  an  application  for  Marketing Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) for Jalra, through the centralised procedure according to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMEA/CHMP on 24 April 2008.

The  legal  basis  for  this  application  refers  to  Article  10c  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended  relating to informed consent from the marketing authorisation holder Novartis Europharm Ltd. for the authorised medicinal product Galvus (EU/1/07/414/001-010 and EU/1/07/414/018).

## Licensing status:

The initial product, Galvus, has been given a Community Marketing Authorisation on 26 September 2007.

The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur appointed by the CHMP were:

Rapporteur: Bengt Ljungberg

Co-Rapporteur: Pierre Demolis

## 1.2 Steps taken for the assessment of the product

- The application was received by the EMEA on 4 July 2008.
- The Rapporteur's Assessment Report was circulated to all CHMP members on 29 August 2008. The Co-Rapporteur's Assessment Report was circulated to all CHMP members on 29 August 2008.
- The procedure started on 27 July 2008.
- During  the  meeting  on  22-25  September  2008,  the  CHMP,  in  the  light  of  the  overall  data submitted  and  the  scientific  discussion  within  the  Committee,  issued  a  positive  opinion  for granting a Marketing Authorisation to Jalra on 25 September 2008. The applicant provided the letter  of  undertaking  on  the  follow-up  measures  to  be  fulfilled  post-authorisation  on  24 September 2008.

## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.

Therefore,  consent  from  the  MAH  of  the  Galvus  application,  which  had  been  submitted  as  a  full application under Art 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, has been given allowing access to Module  2  to  Module  5  of  the  initial  dossier  of  this  authorised  product  and  any  subsequent  postmarketing  procedures  submitted,  assessed  and  approved.  The  application  for  Jalra  consists  only  of Module 1 information.

As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Jalra medicinal product are identical to the up-todate  quality,  safety  and  efficacy  profile  of  Galvus.  Information  on  the  scientific  discussions  can  be found in the Galvus CHMP assessment report and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).

The approved indication is:

'Vildagliptin is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus:

As dual oral therapy in combination with

-  metformin,  in  patients  with  insufficient  glycaemic  control  despite  maximal  tolerated  dose  of monotherapy with metformin,

- a sulphonylurea, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea and for whom metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance,

-  a  thiazolidinedione,  in  patients  with  insufficient  glycaemic  control  and  for  whom  the  use  of  a thiazolidinedione is appropriate.'

The recommended dose is 100 mg daily administered as one dose of 50 mg in the morning and one dose  of  50  mg  in  the  evening,  except  for  the  combined  use  with  a  sulphonylurea,  where  the recommended dose is 50 mg given in the morning.

Vildagliptin  belongs  to  a  new  class  of  oral  anti-diabetic  drugs  and  is  a  selective  and  reversible inhibitor  of  Dipeptidyl  peptidase  4  (DPP-4),  the  enzyme  which  inactivates  the  incretin  hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), hormones which significantly contribute to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Galvus application, the quality data in support of the Jalra application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Galvus dossier which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Galvus application, the non-clinical data in support of the Jalra application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Galvus dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Galvus application, the clinical data in support of the Jalra application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Galvus dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP considered that the  Pharmacovigilance system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The CHMP did not require the MAA to submit a risk management plan because the reference product Galvus  does  not  have  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  beyond  providing  guidance  in  the prescribing information.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

Since this application is an informed consent of the Galvus application, the CHMP considered that the risk-benefit balance of Jalra was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation for the following indication:

'Vildagliptin is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus:

As dual oral therapy in combination with

- metformin, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin,
- a sulphonylurea, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea and for whom metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance,
-  a  thiazolidinedione,  in  patients  with  insufficient  glycaemic  control  and  for  whom  the  use  of  a thiazolidinedione is appropriate.'
