## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This  module  reflects  the  initial  scientific  discussion  and  scientific  discussion  on  procedures, which have been finalised before 30 November 2004. For scientific information on procedures after this date please refer to module 8B.

## 1. Introduction

The initial  approved  indication  for  Caelyx  was  the  treatment  of  Kaposi's  sarcoma  (KS)  in  patients with  human  immunodeficiency  syndrome  (AIDS).  Caelyx  may  be  used  as  first-line  systemic chemotherapy, or as second line chemotherapy in AIDS-KS patients with disease that has progressed with, or in patients intolerant to, prior combination systemic chemotherapy comprising at least two of the following agents: a vinca alkaloid, bleomycin and doxorubicin (or other anthracycline). Early in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, KS was the most frequent opportunistic neoplasm encountered in patients with AIDS. Due to major improvement of antiviral treatment the prevalence  of  KS  has  markedly  decreased  and  KS  is  now  occurring  later  in  the  course  of  HIV infection,  in  advanced  AIDS  patients  with  low  CD4  cell  count.  Complications  of  AIDS-related  KS depend primarily on the stage of the disease and its pattern of clinical manifestations: cutaneous versus visceral.

In 2000 the indication was extended to include the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in women who have failed a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen.

Caelyx  contains  the  active  substance  doxorubicin  hydrochloride  (HCl),  an  anthracycline  antibiotic, which inhibits cell proliferation by interaction with nucleic acid.

Caelyx consists of a liposomal formulation of doxorubicin HCl encapsulated in a delivery system of long circulating liposomes (Stealth® or sterically stabilised liposomes) with surface-bound methoxypolyethylene  glycol  distearoylphosphoethanolamine  sodium  salt  (MPEG-DSPE).  This  process  is known as pegylation and protects liposomes from detection by the mononuclear phagocyte system, which increases blood circulation time. Caelyx is therefore characterised by long-acting properties.

Caelyx  is  a  concentrate  for  infusion  supplied  in  strength  2  mg/ml  and  presented  as  a  sterile, translucent, red suspension after dilution in a solution of glucose for intravenous infusion.

## 2. Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The  information  related  to  the  active  substance,  doxorubicin  HCl  obtained  from Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius and submitted in this application constitute the open part of the Drug Master File  (DMF)  as  prepared  by  the  supplier  of  doxorubicin  HCl.  However,  the  full  documentation including  in  the  DMF  has  already  been  evaluated  by  the  UK  Authorities  in  relation  to  another application and has been found satisfactory.

For the finished medicinal product, three formulations have been developed. The one intended to be put on the market includes ammonium sulphate (drug loading related to the concentration) and three lipid components which constitute the liposomal membrane:

- Fully hydrogenated soy phosphatidyl choline (HSPC)
- α -(2-[1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero(3)phosphooxy]ethylcarbamoyl)ω -methoxypoly(oxyethylen)40, sodium salt (MPEG-DSPE)
- Cholesterol.

To ensure that there is no risk of transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy linked to the use of cholesterol, the applicant provided information on the source of this material.

As  MPEG-DSPE,  an  amphophilic  compound  responsible  for  the  long  acting  properties  of  these liposomes,  is  a  new  critical  excipient,  full  documentation  has  been  submitted.  With  regards  to  its function in this formulation, the most important feature of this molecule is the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) essential for proper disposition between the lipophilic regions of the liposome surface and  the  aqueous  surrounding  region.  Plasma  circulation  times  for  these  liposomes  are  sensitive  to changes in the hydrophilic shell provided by MPEG-DSPE i.e. related to the molecular weight of the MPEG  used.  With  MPEG  2,000  and  above,  satisfactory  prolongation  is  observed.  Therefore  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reassure that a small reduction would not have a significant effect on liposomal circulation times the applicant agreed to tighten the molecular weight specification for MPEG-DSPE.

The complicated manufacturing process was considered to be well-described in the application. The actual formation of the liposomes is standard. The manufacturing process involves a sterile filtration step using a filter that has been validated. Bulk holding times have been minimised or eliminated to control potential microbial contamination. In response to a concern raised with respect to microbial contamination, a pre-sterilised bioburden limit was adopted by the applicant above which batches will be rejected.

In relation to the finished product specifications at release and at the end of shelf-life, the applicant agreed to tighten some specifications to improve the consistency and the uniformity of the medicinal product  and  to  reassure  that  changes  in  product  quality  during  storage  do  not  affect  clinical performance.

The  container  is  in  compliance  with  the  European  Pharmacopoeia:  Type  I  clear  glass  vial  with  a bromobutyl rubber stopper (siliconised).

Results  of  stability  tests  are  considered  consistent  to  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  of  18  months. Therefore, a shelf-life of 18 months is appropriate when the finished product is stored in the original container between 2 ' and 8 ' C. In relation to the diluted product, data indicate adequate stability in dextrose 5% for no more than 24 hours at temperatures between 2 ' and 8 ' C.

In summary, pharmaceutical issues, which have been raised during the evaluation of the application, have  been  resolved  and  all  the  data  provided  gave  the  assurance  of  the  quality  of  the  medicinal product.

In the course of the extension of the indication to ovarian cancer the MAH applied for an additional pack-size  to  accommodate  the  higher  dose  for  the  new  indication  .(50mg/25ml).  The  stability  data provided demonstrated that the new 50 mg vials are of comparable quality to the initial 20 mg vials and support an identical shelf life.

## 3. Toxico-pharmacological aspects

Doxorubicin  HCl  is  an  anticancer  anthracycline  antibiotic.  It  acts  through  intercalation  of  bases  of double-stranded  DNA,  and  by  inhibition  of  DNA  topoisomerase  II,  an  enzyme  involved  in  DNA replication, whose activity is markedly increased in proliferating cells.

Caelyx  accumulates  in  areas  of  abnormal  vessel  architecture  commonly  observed  in  malignant tumours.  Since  KS  is  a  highly  vascularised  tumour,  it  is  expected  that  Caelyx  will  preferentially accumulate in KS lesions.

During the development programme, three formulations of Caelyx were evaluated. To simplify the assessment,  only  data  related  to  the  formulation  intended  to  be  introduced  onto  the  market  are considered in this document.

## Pharmacodynamics

Studies on pharmacodynamic effects with respect to the proposed indication have been performed in vivo in  mice  using  a  range  of  murine  and  human  xenograft  tumour  types.  Results  showed  that  in  a variety of tumour models, Caelyx was more effective than the same dose of doxorubicin hydrochloride in  inhibiting  tumour  growth,  in  effecting  cures  and/or  prolonging  survival.  Variation  in  liposomal diameter in the range 100-150 nm had no significant effect on anti-tumour activity of Caelyx. As part of  the  indication  is  in  patients  refractory  to  conventional  chemotherapy,  the  Multi-Drug  Resistance (MDR) has been estimated. Since some preliminary investigations on the activity of Caelyx in MDR tumour model suggest that this medicinal product can overcome MDR to some extent, and since no evidence  for  MDR  was  observed  in  patients  who  failed  prior  anthracyclines,  MDR  is  considered unlikely to be a major problem with Caelyx.

Studies  intended  to  investigate  potential  secondary  pharmacological  effects of  the  stealth  placebo liposomes (i.e. 'empty' liposome containing no doxorubicin hydrochloride) revealed no neurotoxicity signs or adverse behavioural effects in rodents. In a non-rodent, after an i.v. infusion of stealth placebo liposomes,  hypotensive  effects  characterised  as  anaphylactic-like  responses  were  reported.  The relevance of this effect to the clinical use of Caelyx is unknown. However, to reflect this observation, a  statement  has  been  included  in  the  SPC. In  vitro ,  Caelyx,  stealth  placebo  liposomes  and  free doxorubicin appeared to have minimal haemolytic effect when mixed with human or rodent blood.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sufficient data from animal models were provided to demonstrate the anti-tumour activity of Caelyx to a range of murine and human xenograft tumour types.

## Pharmacokinetics

Although the ADME studies (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion), and in particularly metabolism and excretion components, carried out in rats, rabbits and dogs, were considered sparse, data  were  available  to  characterise  the  major  differences  and  similarities  between  free  doxorubicin HCl and this liposomal formulation.

The  pharmacokinetic  profile of  Caelyx, determined  in multiple species was  considered  well characterised. After a single intravenous (IV) administration, the volume of distribution was shown to be approximate to the total blood volume, which indicated low liposome uptake by normal tissues in comparison  with  free  doxorubicin  HCl.  The  principal  pharmacokinetic  characteristics  are  biphasic plasma  concentration-time  curve,  low  rate  of  clearance,  high  area-under-the-curve  (AUC),  small volume of distribution and a prolonged secondary half-life that accounts for the majority (&gt; 95%) of the  AUC.  Regarding  metabolism,  some  results  have  demonstrated  that  liposomal  incorporation modifies the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of doxorubicin without any major effect on the route of metabolism.

Multiple-dose  studies  in  rodents  and  non-rodents  gave  dose-proportional  tissue  concentrations  of doxorubicin  with  distribution  patterns  comparable  to  those  in  the  single-dose  rodent  study.  Caelyx produced lower tissue levels of doxorubicin in heart and kidney compared with equimolar doses of doxorubicin HCl. Skin lesions noted in both rodents and non-rodents were associated with higher drug concentrations compared with those in unaffected skin.

No relationship has been found between tissue AUCs (free + liposomal doxorubicin) and toxicity in animal studies conducted with Caelyx. To explain this , two hypotheses, considered satisfactory have been suggested, based on the relationship of toxicity to peak doxorubicin HCl concentration and on the lymphatic drainage of normal tissues.

A  single-dose  study  in  rodents  showed  that  pharmacokinetic  parameters  are  independent  of  minor variations in lipid composition, liposome particle size, content of LPC or source of MPEG-DSPE.

No further distribution and excretion studies using stealth placebo liposomes have been performed.

The main pharmacokinetic characteristics of Caelyx are the extended half-life and the higher Cmax and AUC values in comparison to conventional doxorubicin injection at equimolar doses.

## Toxicology

A repeated-dose intravenous toxicity study undertaken in rodents with Caelyx was discontinued after eight  doses owing to high mortality related to skin toxicity and poor general health of the animals. Similar  toxic  effects  were  observed  for  Caelyx  and  doxorubicin  HCl:  decreased  body  weight, decreased white blood cells (WBC) and red blood cells (RBC) counts, thymic and testicular atrophy, hypocellular  bone  marrow,  myocyte  vacuolation  and  myocardial  degeneration.  Caelyx  was  less myelotoxic,  cardiotoxic  and  nephrotoxic  than  doxorubicin  HCl,  but  more  dermotoxic  (reversible dermal toxicity in the form of lesions on the feet and legs). A study performed in a non-rodent species led to the same conclusions. In terms of dermal toxicity, the no-effect level was 0.25 mg/kg in both rodent and non-rodent species.

Two  additional  studies,  one  in  a  non-rodent  species,  have  been  undertaken  to  assess  the  cardiac, haematological and dermal toxicity of Caelyx. In an animal model for anthracycline cardiotoxicity, up to 50% more Caelyx than doxorubicin could be administered without incurring an increased risk of cardiomyopathy. In a non-rodent species, the severity of Caelyx-associated dermal lesions is related to dose  and  dosing  interval,  with  lower  doses  or  longer  dosing  intervals  resulting  in  reduced  lesion severity.

Myelosuppression was mild and appeared to be primarily confined to the erythroid series. The dermal lesions were generally a more important dose-limiting parameter than myelotoxicity for Caelyx which is not the case for doxorubicin HCl.

The toxicology programme is not complete in relation to reproductive toxicity and mutagenicity. The genotoxicity of Caelyx as a finished product has not been evaluated since doxorubicin, as a powerful mutagen would have swamped any response from the stealth placebo liposomes. Therefore, only the genotoxic potential of the liposomes has been evaluated in a conventional package of tests. Results obtained confirm the innocuity of the liposome components.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The evaluation of reproductive toxicity was restricted to fertility studies (segment II). Since there are data on the embryotoxic and teratogenic nature of doxorubicin HCl, as well as on its ability to induce long-term  or  permanent  sterility  (in  rats  and  dogs  testicular  atrophy  may  be  observed),  it  was considered  acceptable  not  to  repeat  the  studies  with  Caelyx.  The  administration  of  high  doses  of Caelyx to pregnant rodent species was associated with decreased foetal weights, decreased litter size and increased resorptions. In a non-rodent species, Caelyx was revealed to be abortifacient. In relation to  these  data,  appropriate  comments have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC).

A local tolerance study, performed in a non-rodent species receiving Caelyx by IV injection revealed no  treatment-related  injection-site  intolerance.  However,  after  subcutaneous  administration,  dosedependent  inflammatory  reactions  have  been  observed  indicating  that  Caelyx  may  provoke  an inflammatory  response  after  accidental  perivenous  administration.  To  reflect  this  fact,  appropriate recommendations and precautions have been added in the SPC. Data on the haemolytic potential of Caelyx submitted showed that neither Caelyx nor the 'empty' liposomes caused any haemolysis of human RBCs or any coagulation or precipitation of human serum or plasma.

The toxicity of MPEG-DSPE, one of the three lipid components of the stealth liposome, has only been evaluated through a limited single-dose study carried out in mice. Nevertheless, results indicate that the material is not acutely toxic.

In  conclusion,  although  Caelyx  and  doxorubicin  HCl  present  a  similar  toxicity  profile,  Caelyx produces  more  dermal  lesions  primarily  on  the  feet  and  legs  whereas  doxorubicin  HCl  is  more cardiotoxic and nephrotoxic. The toxicity profile of Caelyx has been well defined based on available literature  data  on  conventional  doxorubicin  HCl  and  results  from  adequate  studies  performed  in relation to the indication claimed and population sought.

## 4. Clinical aspects

## Kaposis's sarcoma

Although Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is generally not lifethreatening with the exception of gastrointestinal and pulmonary KS, the disease can be severely debilitating (e.g. debilitating oedema, pain,  facial  oedema,  dyspnea).  AIDS-KS  classification  is  based  upon  patient's  overall  clinical  and immunological status as well as the therapeutic goals of the treatment (AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) classification using the Tumour-Immune-System-Systemic illness staging criteria, distribution  of  KS  lesion  sites  and  overall  number  of  lesions).  Current  palliative  systemic  therapies available are:

- alpha-interferon  indicated  for  treatment  of  patients  with  AIDS-KS  that  have  no  history  of opportunistic  infections  and  have  relatively  intact  immune  systems,  i.e.,  patients  with  CD4 counts ≥ 200 mm 3 .
- cytotoxic chemotherapy such as bleomycin and vincristine (BV) or doxorubicin HCl, bleomycin and  vincristine  (ABV).  The  latest  combinations  are  commonly  used  although  none  of  these medicinal products is licensed for treatment of AIDS-KS.

The objective of a liposomal formulation is to allow the release of doxorubicin HCl preferentially at KS lesions and minimise sites of toxicity.

Caelyx is  intended  to  be  administered  intravenously  at  20  mg/m 2 every  two  to  three  weeks  for  the treatment  of  AIDS-related  Kaposi's  sarcoma  (KS)  in  patients  with  low  CD4  counts  (&lt;  200  CD4 lymphocytes/mm 3 ) and extensive mucocutaneous or visceral disease.

Caelyx may be used as first-line systemic chemotherapy, or as second line chemotherapy in AIDS-KS patients with disease that has progressed with, or in patients intolerant to, prior combination systemic chemotherapy  comprising  at  least  two  of  the  following  agents:  a  vinca  alkaloid,  bleomycin  and doxorubicin (or other anthracycline).

## Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics

Since  the  active  moiety  is  well  known,  no  human  pharmacodynamic  studies  specific  for  this formulation have been performed.

The recommended dosing regimen (20 mg/m 2 every two to three weeks) is based on results obtained from two studies which identified the maximum tolerated dose in the intended patient population. Of the three doses tested (10 mg/m 2 , 20 mg/m 2 and 40 mg/m 2 ), 40 mg/m 2 provoked an unacceptable level

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of  myelosuppression in  AIDS-KS  patients  and  there  was  evidence  that  20  mg/m 2 is  more  effective than 10 mg/m 2 .

These data were considered sufficient since they are in line with current recommendations introduced in ICH and CPMP guidelines.

The pharmacokinetic behaviour of Caelyx has been established in cancer patients with solid tumours and in AIDS patients with KS through three studies although only one study (randomised, crossover of single dose of Caelyx 10 or 20 mg/m 2 separated by 3 week washout period and involving 43 patients) was  conducted  in  the  indicated  patient  population  with  the  final  formulation  intended  to  be  on  the market.

Caelyx displays linear pharmacokinetics as AUC and Cmax appeared dose related. In addition Caelyx presents a bicompartmental pharmacokinetics with an initial half-life of approximately 5 hours, which accounts for less than 5% of the total AUC, and a secondary phase of 55 hours which represents the remainder of the AUC.

Compared to Caelyx, free-doxorubicin HCl is cleared rapidly from the plasma, with an initial half-life of approximately 10 minutes, reflecting the rapid tissue uptake of doxorubicin. The apparent volume of distribution of Caelyx is approximately equal to the estimated plasma volume, which suggests that encapsulated  drug  is  restricted  from  entering  the  extravascular  compartment  during  the  plasma distribution phase. At 20 mg/m 2 ,  the  measured  ratios  between lesion and normal skin, determinated following  collection  of  biopsy  and  plasma  samples,  indicate  that  Caelyx,  therefore,  preferentially accumulates in KS lesions.

Clearance (Clt) is prolonged compared to conventional doxorubicin HCl.

After  intravenous  administration,  doxorubicin  HCl  is  rapidly  metabolised  primarily  in  its  major metabolite, doxorubicinol. It has been demonstrated that liposome encapsulated doxorubicin can not be  metabolised,  thus  the  amount  of  doxorubicinol  in  plasma  is  derived  from  metabolism  of doxorubicin  that  has  been  released  from  the  liposome.  However,  based  on  the  results  of  a physiologically based pharmacokinetic simulation model  and plasma levels of doxorubicinol measured throughout this study,  the  level  of  free  doxorubicin  released  from  the  liposome  has  been determined as very low.

The recommended dose interval for Caelyx is longer than the interval required to avoid accumulation (around  5  half-lives).  The  clearance  half-life  of  conventional  doxorubicin  HCl  (approximately 10 minutes in humans) and results obtained from preclinical studies justified the absence of a study evaluating the potential accumulation.

The potential of interactions  with parenteral,  nutritional  lipid-solutions,  or  other  liposomal  products has not been  studied. However,  such  an  interaction  is  not  expected  owing  to  the physical characteristics on the stealth liposome.

An  ongoing  clinical  study  evaluates  the  pharmacokinetics  of  Caelyx  in  hepatic cancer  patients  as determinated by pre-study total bilirubin concentrations. The pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance, half-lives) for these patients appear to be similar to the pharmacokinetic parameters for the 41 AIDSKS  patients from  the randomised  cross-over  single  dose  pharmacokinetic  study.  When  both populations are combined by initial bilirubin level, there still appears no difference in the clearance or half-lives. These data suggest therefore that the pharmacokinetics of Caelyx are unaffected by hepatic insufficiency.  However,  because  of  the  small  number  of  patients  involved  and  the  lack  of  clinical experience,  information  which  recommends  to  reduce  dosage  based  on  experience  gained  with conventional doxorubicin has been included in the SPC.

Concerning renally impaired patients, no studies have been carried out. However, based on the fact that doxorubicin is both metabolised by the liver and excreted by the bile, it was considered reasonable that no dose adjustment is required with Caelyx for this subpopulation group, as reflected in the SPC. In summary, the general pharmacokinetic profile of Caelyx is known and confirms that stealth coating allows liposomes containing doxorubicin HCl to circulate for prolonged periods of time in the plasma of AIDS-KS patients. The liposomes may be more concentrated in KS lesions where the substanceloaded  is  released.  Nevertheless  it  should  be  kept  in  mind  that  there  are  limited  data  regarding metabolism and excretion of Caelyx, pharmacokinetic profile in special population groups and drugdrug interaction, especially with other chemotherapies.

## Efficacy

The initial clinical development programme consisted of two uncontrolled open pivotal studies. These studies involved comparable patient populations (nearly exclusively white homosexual males, aged on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

average 38 years, with advanced AIDS and extensive KS as reflected in the low CD4 cells count, high percentage  of  patients  at  poor  risk  using  the  AIDS  Clinical  Trial  Group).  Patients  enrolled  were considered  as  being  representative  of  the  overall  patient  population  with  AIDS-related  Kaposi's sarcoma.

This  first  study  involving  247  patients  was  designed  as  a  multicentre,  uncontrolled  open  trial  of Caelyx.  The  median  dose  received  was  20  mg/m 2 and  patients  received  a  total  of  2,015  cycles  of treatment,  cycles  being  repeated  at  2  weekly  intervals.  Clinical  endpoints  included  therapeutic response and Quality of Life. Results obtained from this study are as follows:

| complete response   | 6.3%   |
|---------------------|--------|
| partial response    | 74.4%  |
| stable              | 18.5%  |
| progression         | 0.8%   |

complete response (CR) defined as absence of any detectable residual disease partial response (PR) defined as absence of new lesions (cutaneous - visceral) stable disease (SD) defined as any response not meeting the criteria for CR, PR or PD progressive disease (PD) defined as development of new events such as new lesions

Long-term follow-up is  ongoing  and  only  a  portion  of  the  patients  received  the  intended  marketed formulation. However, analysis of response on the basis of formulation administered did not show any significance in response data. To date, the mean duration of response is 117 days and quality of life data related to pain seem to be improved.

This second study involving 137 patients with AIDS related to KS was designed as an uncontrolled, open trial. The median dose of Caelyx final formulation was 20 mg/m 2 , repeated 3 weekly. 2 . Response rates

793 cycles of therapy were administered with a median cumulative dose of 110 mg/m were as follows:

| complete response   | 0%    |
|---------------------|-------|
| partial response    | 61.8% |
| stable              | 26.5% |
| progression         | 11.8% |

Results obtained from this study were considered as encouraging in terms of response and reduction of pain in all patients included those who received previous chemotherapy. Median duration of response was 92 days. Effects on survival were not significant as 37 patients had died by the cut-off date.

To  support  the  efficacy  of  Caelyx  in  patients  who  are  either  resistant  to  prior  chemotherapy  or intolerant  to  prior  chemotherapy  due  to  toxicity,  data  obtained  from  a  cohort  of  77  'refractory' patients  within  the  study  30-12  have  been  submitted.  These  77  patients  received  substantial  prior therapy for KS, prior to enrolment in the study. Forty patients received local radiation therapy, thirty received  intralesional  injections  of  vinblastine  and  twenty  received  systemic  treatment  with  alfainterferon. Many patients received single agent chemotherapy and all patients received combination systemic chemotherapy comprising at least two of the following agents: a vinca alkaloid, bleomycin and doxorubicin (or other anthracycline). The % antitumour response in these patients was 57%.

The  analysis  of  these  two  studies  has  been  adjusted  according  to  leucopenia,  systemic  illness (including prior opportunistic infection) and CD4 cell counts. It has been therefore demonstrated that the overall response rate for patients with initial neutropenia (ANC &lt; 2000 cells/mm 3 )  is  essentially the same (69.3%) as for patients with higher neutrophil counts at baseline (76.6%). In the same way, response rates are similar for patients with good risk (79%) and poor risk at baseline (68%) based on the extent of their systemic illness. With respect to CD4 counts, response rates are similar for patients with CD4 counts &lt; 50 cells/mm 3 and CD4 counts &gt; 50 cells/mm 3 . However, 1% of patients with CD4 &lt; 50 cells/mm 2 had a complete response against 10% of patients with highest CD4 counts.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It  was  suggested  that  data  should  be  provided  from  randomised  controlled  studies  in  order  to  give adequate evidence of efficacy of Caelyx. Therefore the company submitted further data based on a prospectively randomised controlled, parallel,  multicentre  study of  Caelyx  (20  mg/m 2 )  versus  ABV [Adriamycin  (doxorubicin)  (20  mg/m 2 ),  bleomycin  (10  U/m 2 )  and  1  mg  vincristine]  administered every  2  weeks  for  up  to  6  cycles  for  Caelyx  and  for  ABV.  The  study  involved  258  patients  with moderate  to  severe  KS  (patient  demography:  male  98%,  Caucasian  75%,  mean  age  38  years, homosexual &gt; 90%). Caelyx and ABV treatment arms involved 133 and 125 patients respectively. As for the studies mentioned above, most of the patients fell into a poor prognosis group.

The primary efficacy endpoint was based on the response rate to therapy (5 criteria: complete, clinical complete, partial response, stable and progressive disease) whereas the clinical benefit was judged on the  basis  of  patient's  assessment  of  lesion  pain,  the  presence  of  signs  and  symptoms  related  to systemic  lesions,  Karnofsky  performance  status  and  two  quality  of  life  (QOL)  questionnaires.  One questionnaire  for  assessing  QOL  was  disease-specific  for  AIDS-related  KS  and  the  other  was developed by Wu utilising HIV-relevant items from the Medical Outcomes Study and validated by comparing patients with asymptomatic HIV infections and patients with AIDS-related complex.

A  statistically  significant  difference  in  favour  of  Caelyx  was  demonstrated  with  respect  to  the complete/partial response rate at the end of the treatment (46% and 26% response rate for Caelyx and ABV respectively). Duration of response was similar in both groups (mean duration 92.5 days versus 84.8 days, median duration 90 versus 92 days for Caelyx and ABV respectively) as well as patient survival. The recording of lesion characteristics other than size, such as thickness, nodularity, oedema, colour and pain showed an improvement from baseline measurements for both studied groups. Death was not a study endpoint, but median survival was 160 days with Caelyx and 153 with ABV.

With respect to the QOL questionnaires, there were statistically significant differences in favour of Caelyx in 5/9 domains: general health, pain, social functioning, energy level and health distress. With respect  to  the  KS-specific  questionnaire,  there  were  statistically  significant  differences  in  favour  of Caelyx  in  4/9  domains:  pulmonary  dysfunction/pain,  restricted  head/limb  movement,  exercise limitation and sleep disturbance.

In summary, this well-designed and well-conducted study showed equivalence and in some respects superiority of Caelyx compared to ABV in disease symptoms and cosmetic benefit. Although none of the  components  of  ABV  is  licensed  for  the  treatment  of  AIDS-KS,  the  choice  of  comparator  is justified  since  it  is  currently  recognised  as  an  effective  combination  therapy  for  advanced  AIDSrelated KS.

As visceral KS affecting lungs is associated with a higher increase of death (48.6% of patients with KS in the lungs died on study compared to 33.9% of patients with other KS sites), a further evaluation of  patients  with  such  conditions  in  the  three  main  studies  indicated  that  doses  and  duration  of treatment for subjects with lung involvement  were  not  different from  patients without  lung involvement.

The  active  control  study  (30-11)  designed  as  a  randomised  comparative  trial  of  Caelyx  versus bleomycin and vincristine (BV) confirmed the efficacy of C in the treatment of AIDS-related KS. The objectives of this  trial  were  to  determine  the  efficacy  of  Caelyx  by  comparison  with  an  established therapy and to evaluate the safety and tolerance in a population of AIDS patients with moderate to severe KS.

A total of 241 patients with moderate to severe KS were involved, of whom 218 were evaluable for efficacy. Patients received intravenously either Caelyx administered at 20 mg/m 2 every three weeks or BV (15 mg/m 2 bleomycin and 1.4 mg/m 2 vincristine) administered in cycles every three weeks. The mean number of cycles per patient was 4.8 for Caelyx and 3.7 for BV. The primary endpoint was the therapeutic  response  defined  as  complete  response,  clinically  complete  response,  partial  response, stable and progression. The secondary endpoints included the patient's assessment of the lesion pain, the presence of signs and symptoms related to systemic lesions, Karnofsky performance status and two

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Quality of Life (QoOL)  questionnaires including one disease-specific for AIDS-related  KS questionnaire. Results obtained from the study at the end of the treatment were as follows:

|                              | CAELYX   | BV    |
|------------------------------|----------|-------|
| Complete response            | 0%       | 0%    |
| Clinically complete response | 3.3%     | 0%    |
| Partial response             | 35.5%    | 14.2% |
| Stable                       | 32.2%    | 45.0% |
| Progression                  | 9.9%     | 21.7% |

No patient showed complete response to either therapy.

A statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.001) in favour of Caelyx was demonstrated with regard to the clinically complete/partial response at the end of the treatment (38.8% and 14.2% response rate for Caelyx  and  BV  respectively).  The  recording  lesion  characteristics  (thickness,  nodularity,  oedema, colour,  pain  and  size)  showed  a  statistically  significant  improvement  from  baseline  versus  end  of treatment  in  Caelyx  group  (p  &lt;  0.006).  There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  between Caelyx  and  BV  in  terms  of  change  from  baseline  measurements  in  cutaneous  and  gastrointestinal lesion involvement by KS or in Karnofskyi performance status. With respect to the QoOL, there were statistically significant differences from baseline in favour of Caelyx in cognitive functioning and in difficulty wearing clothes.

Based on these results, Caelyx appeared to be effective in the treatment of AIDS-related KS in patients with  low  CD4  counts  (&lt;  200  CD4  cells/mm 3 )  and  extensive  mucocutaneous  or  visceral  disease.  A better compliance and a higher response rate is associated with Caelyx than with BV.

## Safety

The safety profile of Caelyx was established based on results obtained from original data submitted, the comparative study with a second objective aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerance of Caelyx in comparison to ABV, from the AIDS-KS patient safety database updated to September 1995 including the  follow-up  of  the  second  uncontrolled  study  which  has  since  the  end  of  1994  become  a compassionate use protocol. The second comparative trial (30-11) provided additional safety data. With respect to results obtained from the first comparative study, Caelyx compared to ABV has been demonstrated to have a better tolerance since 68% of the patients completed the prescribed six cycles of treatment with this medicinal product against 34% with ABV. Data obtained from the comparative study support the fact that Caelyx is safer than conventional doxorubicin at the same dose in terms of myelotoxicity,  cardiotoxicity,  or  other  drug-related  toxicities  regardless  of  relationship  to  treatment (see table 1).

Table 1: Summary of safety data obtained from the comparative study

|                                 | Caelyx (n = 133)   | ABV (n = 125)   |
|---------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Patients completing protocol    | 68%                | 34%             |
| Hair loss                       | 11%                | 42%             |
| Severe neutropaenia (ANC < 500) | 7%                 | 15%             |
| Mucositis/stomatitis            | 18%                | 8%              |
| Nausea/vomiting                 | 34%                | 58%             |
| Peripheral neuropathy           | 12%                | 28%             |

Considering these results, patient tolerance on Caelyx appeared to be better than on ABV, since 68% of  patients  on  Caelyx  completed  the  protocol  compared  to  34.4%  on  ABV.  Nausea/vomiting  and peripheral  neuropathy  seemed  to  be  less  common  with  Caelyx,  although  the  difference  was  not statistically significant. Although the overall incidence of neutropenia (ANC &lt; 1000 cells/mm 3 )  was similar, patients treated with ABV experienced a significantly higher probability of developing severe neutropenia (ANC &lt; 500 cells/mm 3 ) at sometime during the study than patients treated with Caelyx.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This higher level of neutropaenia was associated with a corresponding higher use of growth factors (G-CSF) in the ABV-treated patients.

In  study  30-11,  the  two  regimens  did  not  show  significant  differences  for  most  adverse  events. However  some  events  including  allergic  and  anaphylactic  reactions,  gastrointestinal  disturbances, confusion and dizziness were at least twice more frequent with Caelyx than with BV treatment.

Significantly more patients terminated early BV treatment than Caelyx due in particularly to adverse events (26.7% versus 10.7% respectively).

In  this  study  opportunistic  infections  with  three  organisms  (candidiasis,  herpesx  simplex  and toxoplasmosis)  were  statistically  significantly  more  frequent  following  Caelyx  than  following  BV treatment. When adjusted for duration of exposure, the frequency of opportunistic infections is only slightly  higher  following  Caelyx  treatment  which  suggested  that  this  difference  might  be  due  to  a better  compliance  and  longer  exposure  with  the  Caelyx  regimen  (median  160.0  days  with  Caelyx versus 62.5 days with BV). A higher frequency of leucopenia, possibly or probably associated to the drug was associated with Caelyx (71.9% versus 38.3% with BV).

So  far,  the  overall  treatment-related  safety  profile  of  Caelyx  seemed  to  be  favourable  to  Caelyx compared with the alternative combination therapy, since there are less risks associated with Caelyx and a better tolerability. However, in the comparative trial with the BV combination (Study 30-11) cases of opportunistic infections, anaphylaxis, confusion and dizziness have been highlighted.

## Ovarian cancer

The  pivotal  trial  30-49  submitted  in  support  of  this  indicationn  was  a  Phase  III  open  randomised comparative trial in women with advanced ovarian cancer who have failed a first-line platinum based chemotherapy regimen, with topotecan as the active comparator. In addition results from three Phase II studies were submitted.

## Summary of Phase II studies

All three single arm trials targeted patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma, with studies 30-47 and 30-47E  including  patients  specifically  refractory  to  both  platinum  and  paclitaxel.  All  safety  and efficacy analyses were based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. The dosing regimen was similar for all three studies: studies 47 and 47E prescribed a 50 mg/m 2 dose of Caelyx on a 4-week dosing interval whilst study 30- 22 prescribed a 3-week dosing interval.

The  protocols  used  consistent  definitions  for  evaluating  response  (the  primary  efficacy  parameter). Responses were assessed by standard Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria, with confirmation four  weeks later.  Responses for study 30-22 and 30-47 underwent independent radiological review. The  secondary  efficacy  parameters  were  time  to  response,  duration  of  response  and  time  to progression.

The overall  response  rate  for  the  intent-to-treat  population  varied  from  6.5%  -  20%  (Table  1).  The overall  response  rate  in  the  combined  intent-to-treat  population  is  12.3%.  The  majority  of  patients experienced a partial response (25/27). The median time to progression varied from 81 to 172 days.

Table 1 Efficacy in the ITT population

| Study   | Efficacy parameters   | Efficacy parameters            | Efficacy parameters                | Efficacy parameters               | Efficacy parameters            |
|---------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
|         | Objective Response    | Median Time to Response (days) | Median Duration of Response (days) | Median Time to Progression (days) | Median Overall Survival (days) |
| 30-22   | 20%                   | 167                            | 427                                | 172                               | 376                            |
| 30-47   | 13.1%                 | 106                            | 285                                | 142                               | N/A                            |
| 30-47E  | 6.5%                  | 57                             | 124                                | 81                                | N/A                            |

Data  from  the  European  47E  study  showed  a  lower  response  rate  than  the  US  47  study  (6.5%  vs 13.1%) and a shorter median time to progression (81 days versus 142 days). A detailed review of prior chemotherapy treatment revealed some significant differences between the studies. In particular more patients in study 47 had received paclitaxel combined with platinum as their first-line therapy than the patients in study 47E (75% vs 40%). It is recognised that the introduction of paclitaxel into first line therapy  has  a  significant  impact  on  overall  survival  in  ovarian  cancer  and  thus  may  explain  these differences.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  MAH  have  provided  further  information  on  overall  response  rates  in  the  platinum/paclitaxel refractory patients (14.5%) and in the platinum/paclitaxel/topotecan refractory population (9%). The combined refractory patients accounted for 188/219 ITT population.

However, the overall  response  rate  of  the  combined  refractory  population  is  a  modest  12.2%,  very similar to the overall ITT cohort (12.3%).

Caelyx  response  rate  based  on  prior  platinum  response  was  also  evaluated.  Patients  who  progress during their last platinum-containing regimen have a poorer prognosis than those who progress at a later time. This trend is also apparent in the refractory patients treated with Caelyx.

## Phase III Study

The pivotal trial 30-49 was an open randomised comparative trial in women with advanced ovarian cancer who have failed a first-line platinum based chemotherapy regimen, with topotecan as the active comparator.

The final  analysis  includes  474  patients  in  the  ITT  population;  416  of  these  patients  met  protocolspecified  enrolment  criteria  and  received  at  least  2  cycles  of  study  drug  (evaluable  population). 321/416 (77%) of the evaluable patients had received prior combination paclitaxel/platinum therapy. 439/474 (93%) of patients had progressed or died (217 Caelyx; 222 topotecan) and only 5/474 (1%) (4 Caelyx; 1 topotecan) were still being treated.

## Efficacy

The  primary  endpoint  was  time  to  progression  (TTP)  for  the  evaluable  population,  with  overall survival  and  response  rate  serving  as  secondary  endpoints.  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  of  time  to progression and overall survival were generated for both the evaluable and ITT populations and the treatment groups were compared using the stratified log-rank test. Hazard ratios for topotecan relative to Caelyx were calculated and protocol-specified 90% and interim analysis adjusted 91.6% confidence intervals were provided.

The MAH claims that whereas the study was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority, the results of the  protocol-specified  endpoint  (time  to  progression  in  the  evaluable  population)  demonstrate superiority of Caelyx over topotecan (hazard ratio 1.262, 90% CI 1.062-1.500, p=0.026). The results for  the  ITT  population  were  similar  but  did  not  reach  statistical  significance.  However,  the  study investigators were responsible for assigning treatment response, including radiographic response, and were not blinded to treatment assignment. Independent confirmation of the CT scans was not specified in the protocol and thus the risk of potential bias in assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint has not  been  adequately  addressed.  In  addition,  there  are  statistical  concerns  regarding  the  proportional hazards  assumption.  Therefore,  a  significant  improvement  in  time  to  progression  has  not  been established for Caelyx relative to topotecan.

Given the clinical and statistical reservations relating to the primary endpoint, overall survival would seem  the  better  end-point  to  base  conclusions  upon,  because  overall  survival  is  unaffected  by  any potential tumour assessment bias. Overall survival was similar for Caelyx and topotecan for both the evaluable  and  ITT  populations,  with  the  hazard  ratio  favouring  Caelyx  (HR  1.121,  90%  CI  0.9201.367, ITT population). As topotecan is an appropriate comparator, there is adequate evidence of the non-inferiority of Caelyx for the indication proposed .

## Platinum sensitive and platinum refractory patients

Both  time  to  progression  and  overall  survival  were  significantly  longer  for  Caelyx  as  compared  to topotecan-treated patients in the platinum sensitive sub-group. Therefore, there is strong evidence of efficacy in patients with platinum-sensitive disease. In platinum refractory patients the survival trend favours topotecan (HR = 0.895, 90% CI 0.700 - 1.143). The evidence of non-inferiority is therefore less  convincing  in  platinum  refractory  than  in  platinum  sensitive  patients.  However,  the  distinction between these two platinum sub-groups is not a standardised one and in practice is only used when considering subsequent treatment with a platinum-containing regimen.

## Safety and quality of life (QOL)

The median dose of Caelyx delivered was 50 mg/m 2 , with a median cycle length of 30 days; median dose  of  topotecan  delivered  was  7  mg/m 2 ,  with  a  median  cycle  length  of  24  days.  Most  patients received 4 to 5 cycles of study drug.

Most patients discontinued the study drug due to disease progression: 48% for Caelyx and 47% for topotecan.  Slightly  more  patients  treated  with  Caelyx  discontinued  because  of  adverse  events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(16%  versus  12%  of  patients  treated  with  topotecan).  Overall,  treatment-related  adverse  events observed with Caelyx tended to be of non-serious and of mild or moderate severity; however palmarplantar  erythrodysesthesia  (PPE)  was  severe  in  23%  and  stomatitis  was  severe  in  8%  of  patients treated with Caelyx.

Both the incidence and severity of haematologic adverse events were greater with topotecan than with Caelyx. Neutropenia and anaemia were reported in 78% of the topotecan group compared to about 35% with Caelyx. Neutropenia was severe or life- threatening in 71% of topotecan-treated patients (including  2  deaths),  compared  with  only  12%  of  Caelyx-treated  patients.  In  addition,  nausea  and alopecia were more common with topotecan than with Caelyx.

Overall, the treatment impact on patients' health-related QOL was similar between the two treatments. QOL was assessed at week 12, and therefore data is only available on the 50% of patients who still remained in the study. Comparison of the groups in terms of maintenance of or improvement in scores from  baseline  to  12  weeks  indicated  a  minor  advantage  in  role/social  functioning  and  global  QOL scores for the Caelyx-treated group compared with the topotecan-treated group. However, topotecantreated patients experienced significantly less pain than Caelyx-treated patients (81% versus 64% with maintenance of or improvement in pain scores) associated with an advantage in emotional functioning (74% versus 67%). PPE may have been responsible for the reported worsening of Pain score in the Caelyx-treated patients.

The global QOL was the same for platinum sensitive and refractory sub-groups, with 60% of patients reporting maintenance or improvement in global QOL scores at 12 weeks. Overall there appears to be adequate evidence of a favourable safety profile for Caelyx for the indication proposed. The benefit to risk balance of Caelyx seems comparable to that of topotecan in this indication.

## 5. Overall conclusion and benefit/risk assessment

Caelyx, a pegylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin hydrochloride, was developed to provide effective palliative therapy for symptomatic AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma with an acceptable level of toxicity.

The chemical and pharmaceutical data were adequate to support the quality of this original liposomal formulation.

As  the  active  substance  is  already  well-  known,  the  toxicological  programme  presented  was considered sufficient.

Caelyx in the treatment of AIDS-KS patients is an effective palliative single agent therapy which has statistically significantly superior efficacy and tolerability compared  with a current standard combination  chemotherapy,  ABV,  which  is  an  appropriate  comparator  in  this  particular  patient population. Evidence of efficacy in refractory patients, has also been provided.

The CPMP has considered during the review process that, with regard to the data provided, the overall benefit/risk  ratio  for  Caelyx  is  favourable  for  the  proposed  regimen  in  AIDS  related  KS  and recommended  granting  a  Marketing  Authorisation  for  Caelyx  for  AIDS-related  Kaposi's  sarcoma (KS) in patients with low CD4 counts (&lt; 200 CD4 lymphocytes/mm 3 )  and extensive mucocutaneous or visceral disease.

In a subsequent variation, data were provided regarding the efficacy and safety of Caelyx in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. The CPMP reviewed the submitted trials and considered that there is adequate evidence of a favourable benefit/risk ratio for Caelyx for the proposed indication: treatment of  advanced  ovarian  cancer  in  women  who  have  failed  a  first-line  platinum  based  chemotherapy regimen.  Whilst  the  evidence  of  non-inferiority  is  less  convincing  in  platinum  refractory  than  in platinum  sensitive patients, the distinction between  these two  platinum  sub-groups  is not a standardised one and in practice is only used when considering subsequent treatment with a platinumcontaining regimen.

Therefore, the CPMP recommended the extension to the Marketing Authorisation to include treatment of  advanced  ovarian  cancer  in  women  who  have  failed  a  first-line  platinum  based  chemotherapy regimen.

## 6. Metastatic Breast Cancer

The indication of Caelyx was further extended in the area of the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Tthe following two indications were initially applied for:

- 1 Metastatic breast cancer in women for whom an anthracycline would be considered.
- 2 Metastatic breast cancer in women who have failed a taxane containing regimen.

Following the evaluation of the dossier, the second indication was withdrawn by the MAH and the first was modified. The proposed posology was the same as for ovarian carcinoma and is as follows:

- Caelyx is administered intravenously at a dose of 50 mg/m 2 once every 4 weeks for as long as the disease does not progress and the patient continues to tolerate treatment

The safety profile of Caelyx differs from that of conventional doxorubicin formulations.  In particular it is associated with palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), an adverse effect not generally seen with conventional doxorubicin formulations. PPE is characterised by a painful macular red skin eruption, particularly of the soles and palms.  Allergic type infusion phenomena are also rather more frequent than with conventional doxorubicin formulations.  Caelyx is, however, associated with less alopecia, nausea,  vomiting  and  myelosuppression  than  equally  effective  doses  of  conventional  doxorubicin. The question of its cardiotoxicity compared to conventional formulations in the setting of metastatic breast cancer was considered in this application.

Information was also proposed for inclusion into the SmPC which effectively claims that Caelyx is associated with less cardiotoxicity in this indication than conventional doxorubicin formulations.

In addition, the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin differ when administered as Caelyx. Distribution is largely confined to the plasma compartment and the mean half life is much prolonged (73.8 hours) in comparison to conventional doxorubicin formulations.

## -Clinical  aspects

Three relevant studies were provided to support the application.  These comprised one dose-finding breast cancer trial and two phase III studies conducted in subjects with metastatic breast cancer.

- -Study 30-17 , a dose-finding trial in altogether 73 patients with breast cancer.
- -Protocol  I97-328 ,  a  Phase  III,  randomised,  comparative  trial  that  compared  the  efficacy  and cardiac  safety  of  Caelyx  to  that  of  conventional  doxorubicin  in  the  first-line  treatment  of metastatic breast cancer
- -Protocol C/I96-352 , a Phase III, randomised, comparative study that compared the efficacy and safety of Caelyx with an approved salvage regimen (vinorelbine or mitomycin C + vinblastine) in women with advanced breast cancer who had failed a taxane-containing regimen.

## Pharmacokinetics.

Population PK data were provided for 18 breast cancer patients for whom data are available. The kinetics of Caelyx in those with breast cancer appears similar to those with other tumours.

## Dose- finding study

Study ( 30-17 ) was presented to justify the choice of dose. 73 patients were recruited who had either previously received no previous chemotherapy or, alternatively, had received cyclophosphamide and 5-Fluorouracil.  The following dose schedules of Caelyx were assessed: 60mg/m 2 every 21 days, 45mg/m 2 every 28 days, 45mg/m 2 every 21 days, 60mg/m 2 every 28 days for two cycles followed by 45mg/m 2 every 28 days.

The dose regimen of 45mg/m 2 every 4 weeks was considered the optimal one of those studied. The dosage employed for the subsequent phase III trials was similar, 50 mg/m 2 every 4 weeks, which is also the approved dosage of Caelyx for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.

## Efficacy in first line treatment

Phase III open label study I97-328 compared Caelyx to conventional doxorubicin.

The protocol of the study is summarised in table 1:

This  pivotal  phase  III  open  label  study  was  conducted  in  multiple  centres  across  Europe,  Canada, South America and Israel.  The purpose of the study was to demonstrate that Caelyx was non-inferior to doxorubicin with regard to progression free survival and that Caelyx was superior to conventional doxorubicin with regard to cardiac toxicity.

509 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomised to receive either Caelyx 50 mg/m 2 every 4 weeks by IV infusion or conventional doxorubicin 60mg/m 2 IV every 3 weeks.  The primary endpoints were a comparison of progression free survival and cardiac toxicity.  Secondary endpoints included overall survival, and response rate.

Subjects  were  stratified  prior  to  randomisation  according  to  the  following  parameters:  1)  previous adjuvant  anthracycline  therapy;  2)  presence  of  bone  metastases  as  only  site  of  disease;  and  3)  the presence  of  any  one  of  the  following  cardiac  risk  factors:  prior  mediastinal  irradiation,  age ≥ 65, history of heart disease (previous MI, arrhythmia, or angina), hypertension, or diabetes that required medical treatment. Due to characteristic side effects, a double blind design was not considered to be possible.

Cardiac toxicity during treatment and follow-up was defined as a decrease of 20 points or greater from baseline if the resting LVEF remained in the normal range or a decrease of 10 points or greater if the LVEF  became  abnormal  (less  than  the  institution's  lower  limit  for  normal).  Subjects  were  also assessed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF).

Tumour response status was evaluated clinically every 3 weeks for doxorubicin and every 4 weeks for Caelyx  and  by  diagnostic  scans  (CT  or  MRI,  and  bone  scan)  every  3  months.  The  protocol  states: 'Radiologic studies of all responding patients (CR, PR) must be made available for subsequent central review'. According to the protocol, assessment of tumour status was to continue every 3 months after discontinuation of therapy, until progressive disease had been shown. According to the analysis plan,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects  with  no  tumour  assessment  and  who did not die within 4  months  after the last assessment were to be censored.  Deaths within 4 months of the last assessment were considered events.

## Results.

## Tumour response

There were altogether 410 patients with measurable disease, but of these 103 were not evaluated for tumour  response.  In  the  majority,  these  patients  received  less  than  12  weeks  of  therapy  and  'an assessment was not required by the protocol' (study report).

Objective Response (WHO) (patients with measurable disease) 33% of patients who received Caelyx were classified as responders (CR &amp; PR) compared to 38% who received conventional doxorubicin.

Quality of life assessment was undertaken using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire.  At the 12-week time point specified, the results significantly favoured doxorubicin over Caelyx with 32% and 20% of patients respectively achieving a 'Clinical Benefit Response' (CBR). However, mean changes from baseline  for  all  functioning  domains  throughout  cycles  1-4  were  small  ( &lt; 8  points)  in  both  groups. EORTC  QLC-C30  symptom  scores  were  comparable  with  both  Caelyx  and  doxorubicin,  and palliation of disease-related symptoms was observed in both treatmnent groups.

Cardiac toxicity results are described under 'Safety'section.

## Study C/I96-352.

Study C/I96-352 was a phase III open label study which employed a randomised open label parallel group design, which was submitted in support of the salvage indication: 'treatment of  women with metastatic  breast  cancer  who  had  failed  first-  or  second-line  therapy  with  a  taxane-containing regimen'  (this  claim  was  withdrawn  by  the  MAH ) .    The  trial  compared  Caelyx  with  2  salvage regimens in women with metastatic breast cancer who had failed first-or second-line therapy with a taxane-containing regimen.  301 patients were randomised to receive either Caelyx 50mg/m 2 every 4 weeks or alternatively either vinorelbine 30mg/m 2 weekly or a combination of mitomycin C 10mg/m 2 IV on Days 1 and 28 and vinblastine, 5 mg/m 2 IV on days 1, 14, 28 and 42 for 2 cycles (Days 1-56); subsequent cycles: mitomycin C, 10 mg/m 2 IV on day 1 and vinblastine at 5 mg/m 2 IV on Days 1 and 21. Mitomycin C was administered at 6-8 week intervals after adequante hematologic recovery.  The choice of this alternative comparator regimen was at the discretion of the investigator. Of the patients enrolled on the comparator arm, 85% received vinorelbine.

The primary efficacy criterion was progression free survival.  Secondary efficacy variables included overall response rate, response duration and overall survival. The primary objective of the study was originally to show the superiority of Caelyx to the active comparator, with regard to Progression Free Survival.    However,  when  this  superiority  was  not  demonstrated,  the  results  were  reconsidered  in terms of non-inferiority of Caelyx to the active comparator regimens.

Progression-free survival, showed a trend in favour of treatment with Caelyx which did not achieve significance [Hazard Ratio = 1.26 ; (95% CI 0.98-1.62)].

Overall Survival showed no significant difference between the treatments

[ Hazard Ratio = 1.07 ; (95% CI 0.79-1.45)

]

Objective Response Rate was similar between the treatments at around 10%.

Quality of life assessment was undertaken using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire.  At the 12-week primary time point, 10% of Caelyx patients achieved a 'Clinical Benefit Response' (CBR) compared with 7.9% of comparator patients.

Cardiac  toxicity  was  defined  as  a  decrease  of  15%  or  greater  from  Baseline  or  a  5%  or  greater decrease from Baseline and the LVEF became abnormal.  Results are described under 'Safety' section

## -Deaths

The number of deaths within 30 days after treatment completion was altogether 61 in the two pivotal studies, evenly distributed between Caelyx and comparators.

## -Serious adverse events

In protocol I97-328, SAEs were reported by 34% of Caelyx and 26% of doxorubicin subjects.  The pattern  was  overall  consistent  with  the  general  pattern  of  AEs  during  the  trial.    Individual  SAEs occurred  in  2%  or  fewer  subjects  in  either  group  with  the  exception  of  dyspnea  (4%)  and  palmarplantar  erythrodysesthesia  (PPE)  (6%)  in  the  Caelyx  group,  fever  (6%)  and  nausea  (4%)  with doxorubicin, vomiting (3% Caelyx, 5% doxorubicin), and neutropenia (3% Caelyx, 7% doxorubicin).

Excluding  subjects  who  died,  there  were  27  subjects  in  protocol  C/I96-352  who  discontinued treatment due to an AE, some of whom also had an AE while on treatment, 15 Caelyx subjects, 11 vinorelbine subjects and 1 mitomycin C + vinblastine subject.  Excluding subjects who died and those who discontinued treatment due to AE, there were 58 subjects who experienced  a serious AE or a medically  significant  event  while  on  treatment,  32 Caelyx  subjects,  23  vinorelbine  subjects  and 3 mitomycin C + vinblastine subjects.

The percentage of subjects who discontinued because of adverse events was similar among the breast cancer and solid-tumour studies: 24% in Protocol I97-328; 19% in Protocol C/I96-352; and 16% in the solid-tumour studies.

Potential Treatment-Limiting Toxicities

Four toxicities have been shown to be potentially treatment-limiting for CAELYX monotherapy:

- Cardiac Toxicity
- Stomatitis,
- Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia.
- Infusion Reactions, which are not related to dose but can cause an interruption of a dose and, in severe cases, lead to discontinuation.

## Cardiac Toxicity (co-primary endpoint in study I97-328)

Results of cardiotoxicity assessment as defined by LVEF and CHF signs and symptoms assessment are presented in Table 11. Overall, 339 subjects had electronic multigated radionucleotide (MUGA) scan data available for cardiotoxicity evaluations by the investigators (baseline and at least one scan during treatment). (Note: MUGAs were not required for subjects with low cumulative anthracycline doses.)

Table 11. Patients meeting cardiac toxicity criteria during treatment and follow-up for trial I97-328

|-------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Cardiotoxicity (LVEF defined) |               10 |                    48 | -20% to -9.4%           |
| With signs or symptoms of CHF |                0 |                    10 |                         |
| No signs or symptoms of CHF   |               10 |                    38 |                         |

Additionally, 2 Caelyx subjects and 2 doxorubicin subjects, who did not have cardiotoxicity by LVEF criteria, developed signs and symptoms of heart failure during or after study treatment.  Of note, one of the Caelyx subjects developed heart failure after only 1 cycle and the other after 2 cycles.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of the 230 subjects who had electronic MUGA data available for independent review, 3 Caelyx subjects and 30 doxorubicin subjects met the protocol-specified LVEF criteria for cardiotoxicity.

Anthracycline administered in the adjuvant situation is included in the cumulative dose estimates.  If there  is  a  difference  in  cardiotoxicity  between  Caelyx  and  conventional  doxorubicin,  this  way  to handle data is conservative.

In study C/I96-352, a total of 22 subjects met the protocol-specified criteria for discontinuation due to cardiac toxicity, but apparently the majority experienced non-specific declines in LVEF, secondary to co-morbid  conditions,  such  as  disease  progression.    The  number  of  cardiac  biopsies  is  limited, however, but in a prior study, biopsy results of 10 KS subjects with cumulative Caelyx doses from 469 to 860 mg/m 2 showed minimal cardiotoxicity.

## Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia (PPE)

The incidence and severity of PPE was similar among breast cancer subjects and subjects in the solidtumour studies.  The majority of reports of PPE were managed by delaying or reducing the dose.

In the breast cancer studies, the occurrence of PPE in cycle 1 was 7% to 10%.  In the breast cancer studies  and  in  the  solid  tumour  studies,  the  incidence  of  PPE  peaked  in  Cycles  2  and  3  of  Caelyx treatment, and then declined in Cycles 4, 5, and 6

## Stomatitis

Approximately  20%  of  subjects  in  the  breast  cancer  studies  and  36%  of  solid-tumour  subjects experienced treatment-related stomatitis.  No breast cancer subject reported Grade 4 stomatitis, and Grade 4 stomatitis was uncommon among subjects in the solid-tumour studies (&lt;1%, 5/929).

## Infusion Reactions

Infusion reactions were characterised by the following adverse events: allergic reaction, anaphylactic reaction, face oedema, flushing, hypotension, urticaria and wheezing.  Approximately 12% of breast cancer subjects experienced an infusion reaction.  One subject in the breast cancer studies, experienced a Grade 4 allergic reaction with the initial dose that was successfully managed with additional therapy and dose interruption, and the subject continued therapy for 13 cycles.

A total of 6 breast cancer subjects discontinued therapy because of an infusion reaction, 4 in Protocol No. I97-328, and 2 in Protocol C/I96-352.  In all 4 subjects in Protocol I97-328, the infusion reactions were associated with immediate or delayed-type hypersensitivity.

Of the 2 subjects in Protocol Nos. C/I96-352 who discontinued because of infusion reaction, one had mild flushing and severe wheezing immediately after the first CAELYX dose and the other had severe skin flushing also after the first dose.

A total of 100 solid-tumour subjects (100/929, 11%) experienced an infusion reaction following the first CAELYX dose.  These reactions led to discontinuation in 19/929 subjects.

## Discussion of efficacy in first line treatment.

The population in study I97-328 appeared representative for patients with advanced breast cancer at the time of first-line chemotherapy. The outcome with respect to PFS appeared very similar between treatment  arms  and  the  non-inferiority  criterion  set  out  in  the  protocol  that  the  lower  bound  of  the confidence interval should be above 0.80, was met. Several concerns were identified relating to the design and conduct of the study that it was considered might affect the interpretation of study data. The study was not powered to compare survival between the two treatments. However, the median overall survival was 21 months for those who received Caelyx and 22 months for those who received conventional doxorubicin (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.74- 1.19). Although acceptance limits were not defined in  the  protocol,  the  95%  CI  reflects  at  worst  a  possible  loss  of  26%  (HR  0.74)  corresponding  to  a possible loss in median survival of about 6 months (i.e. 22-6 = 16 months) or at best a possible gain of 19% (HR 1.19) corresponding to a gain in median survival of about 4 months (22+4 = 26 months). This  range  of  overall  survival  (16-26  months)  is  consistent  with  that  seen  for  anthracycline-based therapy in first-line treatment of metastatic disease.

The  high  discontinuation  rate  prior  to  disease  progression,  and  the  imbalance  in  the  rate  of  such withdrawals  between  the  two  groups  was  a  concern  in  the  assessment  of  non-inferiority.  The imbalance was mainly caused by a higher proportion of withdrawals due to 'investigator discretion' in the  conventional doxorubicin group. Withdrawal due to 'investigator discretion' in the doxorubicin arm  'typically  represented'  (study  report)  patients  approaching  a  cumulative  anthracycline  dose  of 550  mg/m 2 .  'Cardiac  toxicity'  in  a  wide  sense  was,  thus,  a  major  cause  for  discontinuation  in  the doxorubicin arm.

Overall it appeared that in this head-to-head comparison with conventional doxorubicin and on a mg for mg level, the outcome in terms of cardiotoxicity is favourable for Caelyx, with the caveat that the clinical relevance of MUGA scan deterioration may be disputed. The differences between treatment arms in withdrawal rates due to 'cardiac toxicity' and other adverse events are prominent.

The following concerns were raised:

- -Study  I97-328  was  designed  as  a  non-inferiority  study  in  terms  of  progression-free  survival compared with conventional doxorubicin.  Due to the following concerns, all considered to be of importance in the assessment of non-inferiority results, the study is considered inconclusive.
- -The non-inferiority margin has not been justified.
- -There was no external, treatment-blinded assessment of time to progression.
- -The three-month interval between scheduled imaging is regarded as too long.
- -The  eligibility  of  patients  administered  adjuvant  anthracyclines  will  affect  the  possibility  to optimally administer conventional doxorubicin.
- -The  study  population  is  considered  representative,  but  also  heterogeneous  with  respect  to prognostic factors.
- -Only 28% of the doxorubicin and 43% of the Caelyx patients discontinued due to progressive disease
- -Data  on  number  of  censored  patients  prior  to  documented  tumour  progression  should  be presented
- -In patients withdrawn prior to progression, data on next-line therapy should be provided
- -There  were  more  patients  in  the  doxorubicin  treatment  group  than  in  the  Caelyx  group  who were  censored  prior  to  disease  progression,  which  might  affect  the  assessment  of  noninferiority.

These points were discussed with the MAH during an oral explanation:

## Discussion of efficacy in the treatment of patients who have failed taxane containing regimen

In  study  C/I96-352,  the  proportion  of  responders  was  considered  too  small  and  the  duration  of Progression Free Survival too short to be of clinical value, bearing in mind the high frequency and severity of PPE and also the frequency of cardiotoxicity. The rationale of including a high proportion of patients whose disease had progressed despite the use of anthracycline containing regimens in study C/I96-352  was  questioned  since  in  clinical  practice  further  use  of  an  anthracycline  would  not  be considered in this situation. With regard to this, in relation to cardiac safety, it was not considered that a beneficial effect on cardiac safety has been established for cumulative anthracycline doses in excess

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of 450mg/m 2 in this study since 14/150 Caelyx treated patients developed cardiotoxicity at cumulative doses less than this figure.

The results  of  the  single  study  C/I196-352  conducted  in  heavily  pretreated  patients  which  failed  to demonstrate the superiority of Caelyx were considered insufficient to support the indication for Caelyx in  patients  who  have  failed  previous  treatments.  In  conclusion,  the  risk-benefit  assessment  for  the indication for the patients who have failed a taxane- containing regimen has not been demonstrated. Subsequently the MAH withdrew this proposed indication.

## Discussion of Safety

With regard to safety, quality of life was considered to be a primary consideration. In relation to this, it was  considered  that  the  relative  risk-benefit  of Caelyx might  not  be  favourable  compared  to conventional formulations of doxorubicin the proposed first line indication for the following reasons: (i)The  observation  from  the  'Quality  of  Life'  data  from  study  I97-328  showed  that  conventional doxorubicin is superior to Caelyx. (ii) The adverse effects which occurred in association with Caelyx, particularly  the  high  frequency  and  severity  of  palmar-plantar  erythrodysesthesia  (PPE),  were considered to be more burdensome for patients' quality of life than the adverse effects which occurred in  association  with  conventional  doxorubicin.  However,  it  was  conceded  that  PPE  was  not  lifethreatening and was reversible.

These points were extensively discussed with the MAH during the Oral Explanation. It was agreed that clear instructions on the prevention and minimisation of PPE should be included in the SPC and Package Leaflet.

In  relation  to  cardiotoxicity  concern  was  expressed  regarding  the  potential  for  Caelyx  to  cause cardiotoxicity at high cumulative doses.  Since no data nor scientific literature exist to show enhanced efficacy for Caelyx at high cumulative doses compared to conventional doxorubicin formulations, it was  agreed  that  the  proposed  SmPC  should  continue  to  recommend  evaluation  of  LV  function  for every Caelyx administration in excess of 450mg/m 2 .

It  was  concluded    that  Caelyx  should  be  indicated  as  monotherapy  for  the  first  line  treatment  of metastatic breast cancer in those patients at increased cardiac risk. It was considereed that it presents a more  favourable  profile  in  terms  of  cardiotoxicity  as  compared  to  conventional  formulations  of doxorubicin.

Furthermore,  the  SPC  was  amended  to  clearly  specify  severity  and  duration  of  the  main  adverse events: alopecia, nausea/vomiting, neutropenia, PPE, mucositis and stomatitis.

By granting the above indication it was considered that physicians can have the option to use either Caelyx  or  conventional  doxorubicin,  with  their  differing  adverse  event  profiles  on  the  basis  of individual patient choice.

## Benefit/risk assessment

Overall,  the  efficacy  outcome  with  respect  to  PFS  appeared  very  similar  between  Caelyx  and conventional doxorubicin and the non-inferiority criterion set out in the study protocol was met, but a number of methodological points did not allow a more definite conclusion to be made. Furthermore, the outcome in terms of cardiotoxicity is clearly favourable for Caelyx.

The  CPMP,  based  on  the  review  of  data  on  safety  and  efficacy,  considered  by  consensus  that  the benefit / risk ratio of Caelyx in the indication: 'As monotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer,  where  there  is  an  increased  cardiac  risk. '  is  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the granting of the indication.
