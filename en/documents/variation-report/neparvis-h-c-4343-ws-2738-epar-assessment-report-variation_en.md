## 1.  Background information on the procedure

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Novartis Europharm Limited submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 27 June 2024 an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                               | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                 | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I                  |

Update of sections 4.8 and 5.3 of the SmPC in order to update information on long-term data in paediatric patients, based on final results from study CLCZ696B2319E1(PANAROMA-HF OLE) listed as a category 3 study in the RMP (MEA/009); this is a phase 3, multicenter, uncontrolled study to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of open label sacubitril/valsartan in pediatric patients with heart failure due to systemic left ventricle systolic dysfunction who have completed study CLCZ696B2319 (PANORAMA-HF); the RMP version 8 has also been submitted.

The requested worksharing procedure proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## 2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

The Applicant has completed study B2319E1, an open-label long-term extension study of the core Study B2319 in pediatric patients aged ≥ 13 months to 18 years with Heart Failure due to Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (LVSD). Of the 215 participants in this extension study, 109 had received sacubitril/valsartan in the core Study B2319. The median (IQR) duration of exposure to sacubitril/valsartan was 2.5 (1.8, 3.3) years. In core Study B2319, the median (IQR) duration of exposure was 1.0 (0.98, 1.03) year.

Overall, the frequencies of most AEs and SAEs were lower in extension Study B2319E1 than in core Study B2319. Potential reasons are better HF control due to treatment over time, or participants who were most likely to experience events may have discontinued from core Study B2319 and/or been less likely to enroll in Study B2319E1, so called 'depletion of susceptibles'. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the lower frequency of visits compared to core Study B2319 may have played a role in the lower exposure-adjusted rates of AEs and SAEs. In particular, there was a lower proportion of more severe and acute cardiac-related AEs/SAEs vs. a higher proportion of more chronic AEs/SAEs in extension Study B2319E1 than in core Study B2319, favoring the potential explanation that participants receiving sacubitril/valsartan long-term may have had better compensated HF.

The tolerability of sacubitril/valsartan in extension Study B2319E1 was consistent with (or somewhat better than) that observed in core Study B2319. A review of deaths in extension Study B2319E1 showed most participants  had  underlying  contributing  comorbidities  and  complications  associated  with  their  cardiac disease, consistent with the results of core Study B2319.

Growth, bone growth and mineralization.

The  fracture  cases  from  the  AESI  of  Change  in  bone  growth  and  density  were  low  in  frequency  and consistently associated with accidental trauma in both extension Study B2319E1 and core Study B2319. Additionally, fractures in extension Study B2319E1 were not clustered around a particular timepoint, but rather throughout the study duration and the EAIRs between both studies are consistent, not supporting a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

negative  effect  in  bone  mineralization  over  time  with  sacubitril/valsartan  exposure.  With  that,  small reversible  and  transient  bone  effects  in  non-clinical  data  are  not  confirmed  in  paediatrics.  Apart  from fractures, no actual mineralization data was available.

Poor growth is prevalent in children with HF (Avitzur et al 2003), and malnutrition (undernutrition) can be common in pediatric HF due to multiple factors (Bannister et al 2010, Hollander 2019, Onalo et al 2021). There was no evidence for a negative effect of sacubitril/valsartan exposure on growth in pediatric patients with  HF  due  to  LVSD.  Median  changes  from  baseline  in  HAZ  were  close  to  zero  for  all  windows  of observation, for the individual studies and combined analyses, suggesting no significant change in growth. The  subgroup  of  2-9-year-old  participants,  the  age  range  expected  to  experience  linear  growth,  also exhibited median changes in HAZ close to zero. There were only a few participants with clinically meaningful decreases in HAZ.

Overall, the final safety results from long-term, open-label extension Study B2319E1 were consistent with the  safety  results  for  the  sacubitril/valsartan  treatment  arm  in  the  core  Study  B2319  and  with  the extensively evaluated safety profile of sacubitril/valsartan in adults and pediatric patients. There was no negative effect  of  long-term  exposure  to  sacubitril/valsartan  in  extension  Study  B2319E1  compared  to shorter-term data from core Study B2319 on growth or bone growth and mineralization, or any other safety topic assessed. No new or unknown safety signal was observed. Updates to sections 4.8 and 5.3 of the SmPC are proposed based on the submitted data, which are acceptable.

In conclusion, 1) the safety profile of sacubitril/valsartan observed in this study is consistent with the one observed in the PANORAMA-HF core study and described in the labelling, 2) there is no evidence that the long-term exposure of children with HF to sacubitril/valsartan has negative effects on their growth, bone growth or mineralization, and 3) the benefit risk profile of sacubitril/valsartan in the pediatric population remains positive.

An updated RMP version 8.0, dated 20 June 2024 was submitted with this application to remove 'Longterm effects on growth, bone growth and mineralization in the pediatric population' as an important potential risk from the RMP, based on the data from the final study report for study B2319E1. In addition to the deletion of study B2319E1, the PhV plan was updated to reflect a further 6 months delay to the end milestones for the EU Category 3 non-interventional PASS CLCZ696B2014 and CLCZ696B2015, thus constituting an overall delay of two years relative to the original plan. The due date for the submission of the final reports is now 31 Dec 2024.

The changes to the RMP are acceptable and hence RMP version 8.0 was considered acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.  Introduction

Sacubitril/valsartan  (LCZ696,  Entresto®,  Neparvis®)  is  a  first-in-class  angiotensin  receptor  neprilysin inhibitor  (ARNI),  providing  concomitant  neprilysin  (neutral  endopeptidase)  inhibition  and  angiotensin  II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockade. Sacubitril/valsartan was first approved in 2015 for the treatment of adult patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Sacubitril/valsartan is also registered for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) in children and adolescents aged one year or older in more than 40 countries, including the EU.

Sacubitril/valsartan has become the first and only approved therapy available to children with HF with an age-appropriate formulation (granules in capsules) to enable accurate and convenient administration for these patients and their caregivers. In the EU sacubitril/valsartan is available as granules in capsules for opening (granules in capsule) at 6 mg/6 mg and 15 mg/16 mg strengths for use in the pediatric population, i.e., an appropriate dosage form for patients with lowest body weight and/or unable to swallow tablets. Based on the final results from Study CLCZ696B2319 (PANORAMA-HF core study; hereafter Study B2319), sacubitril/valsartan was approved for the pediatric HF indication in the EU in May 2023. The efficacy basis for approval was the similar NT-proBNP reductions, similar exposure-response, and similar associations with favorable clinical response in both pediatric and adult HF populations, in line with the ICH E11A 2022 guideline. HF due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is similar between adult and pediatric populations (as described below), allowing for extrapolation from adult to pediatric patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. The safety results from Study B2319 showed consistency with the well-established safety profile in adults with HF.

## 6.  Clinical Safety aspects

Juvenile toxicity studies of sacubitril/LBQ657 in rats showed reversible and transient bone effects (equivocal reductions in bone mineral density and bone length). The mechanism underlying these effects and their translatability to pediatric patients are unknown. No increased risk of fractures or altered growth were observed in  the  pediatric  participants  over  a  median  follow-up  of  1  year  in  Study  B2319.  In  addition, changes in height and height z-score were comparable between sacubitril/valsartan and control (enalapril) treatment groups and age groups. Study CLCZ696B2319E1 (PANORAMA-HF open label extension study; hereafter Study B2319E1) was initiated in 2019 to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability and to provide post-trial  access  (prior  to  commercial  availability)  to  sacubitril/valsartan  to  eligible  participants  who successfully completed the core Study B2319 Part 2 per protocol. Since the 1-year duration of completed Study B2319 was considered too short to detect long-term changes in growth (Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee 2023) and because long-term effects on growth, bone growth and mineralization in the pediatric population was included as an important potential risk in the Entresto® EU risk management plan (RMP), the ongoing Study B2319E1 became a category III post-authorization safety study (PASS) linked to this important potential risk.

## 6.1.  Methods - analysis of data submitted

## Study CLCZ696B2319E1:

The primary source of safety data for this SCS was a post-authorization safety study, Study B2319E1.

The purpose of Study B2319E1 was to further evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability and to provide post-trial access to sacubitril/valsartan to eligible participants who successfully completed Study B2319 Part 2 by being on study medication (either sacubitril/valsartan or enalapril) at their end of study visit. It was also open to patients who had discontinued study medication early in Study B2319 Part 2 due to implementation by Novartis of an urgent safety measure related to the enalapril regimen but otherwise fulfilled protocol requirements. These participants were eligible for Study B2319E1 and were offered the option to initiate treatment with sacubitril/valsartan by enrolling into this study at the discretion of the investigator. Originally, the study duration was planned to be approximately 1 year after Last Patient Last Visit (LPLV) in Study B2319 Part 2 and approximately 3 years from  the date of First Patient First Visit (FPFV) in Study B2319E1 (02-May-2019). Protocol amendment 1 extended the duration of the study to ensure that participants continued to receive age-appropriate study medication treatment (especially those requiring the pediatric formulations not currently available outside investigational use) and safety follow-up as needed. This was until the expected time when pediatric use of sacubitril/valsartan received local marketing authorization and became commercially available to patients, up to 2 years from LPLV of Study B2319 Part 2, or having reached the maximum limit allowed by local regulations, whichever occurred first.

## Study design and methodology:

This trial was a multicenter, open-label long-term study for participants who have successfully completed the PANORAMA-HF core study Part 2. Participants who successfully completed the 52-week randomized double-blind, treatment period of PANORAMA-HF core study Part 2 (i.e. on dose level 1 or higher at the PANORAMA-HF End of Study visit) and were eligible for the Open-Label Extension (OLE) or who discontinued study drug treatment early in Part 2 due to the implementation of urgent safety measure (USM) of PANORAMA-HF core study, according to the protocol and in the opinion of the investigator, were offered the option to initiate treatment with sacubitril/valsartan by enrolling into this study (CLCZ696B2319E1). For all consenting participants, eligibility for the OLE was assessed at the screening visit (Visit 500) and, for participants under protocol amendment 1 or later, the study medication was initiated no later than 30 days after completion of PANORAMA HF core Part 2 End of Study (EOS) visit (Visit 416) in order to allow for a seamless transfer to the extension study. A 36-hour washout after the last dose of study medication taken in the PANORAMA-HF core study (Visit 416) was required for all participants before starting OLE study medication. A 36-hour washout before starting OLE study medication was also required for all participants that had transitioned to an Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) after completion of PANORAMA-HF core study.

Studies B2319E1 and B2319 were conducted in full compliance with current Good Clinical Practices and were closely monitored by Novartis personnel or a contract research organization for compliance to the protocol, Novartis standard operating procedures, and applicable regulatory guidance.

## Inclusion criteria

Participants eligible for inclusion in this study fulfilled all of the following criteria:

· Signed informed consent as well as assent, at an appropriate age based on country regulations, had to be obtained prior to participation in the study.

· Participants were on study medication at the PANORAMA-HF core study part 2 End of Study visit (Visit 416).

## Exclusion criteria

Participants meeting any of the following criteria were not eligible for inclusion in this study.

1. Participant who only participated in Part 1 of the PANORAMA-HF core study or was a screen failure in PANORAMA-HF core.

2. Use of investigational drugs within 5 half-lives of enrollment or within 30 days whichever was longer; or longer  if  required  by  local  regulations  -  with  the  exception  of  PANORAMA-HF  core  study  drug.  For PANORAMA-HF core study drug (sacubitril/valsartan/placebo; enalapril/placebo), a minimum of 36-hour washout period was required before the initiation of study treatment (Visit 501).

3. History of hypersensitivity or allergy to any of the study treatments or its excipients or to drugs of similar chemical  classes,  ACEIs,  ARBs,  or  NEP  inhibitors  as  well  as  known  or  suspected  contraindications  to sacubitril/valsartan.

4. Renal vascular hypertension (including renal artery stenosis).

5. Participants with significant renal (eGFR calculated using the modified Schwartz formula &lt;30% mean GFR for age) hepatic (serum aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase &gt; 3 times upper limit of normal); gastrointestinal or biliary disorders (that could impair absorption, metabolism, or excretion of orally administered medications).

6. Participants with a history of angioedema.

7. Participants with parents or legal guardians who did not give consent or did not allow the child to give assent, or inability of the participant or the parents/legal guardians to follow instructions or comply with follow-up procedures.

8. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.

9. Any medical condition(s) that could put the participant at risk in the investigator's opinion, orthat the investigator deemed unsuitable for the study.

10. Participant breastfed by a mother taking ACEI.

## Treatments

Similar to PANORMA HF core, Age groups 1 and 2 in the OLE had a target dose (dose level 4) of 3.1 mg/kg bid or 200 mg bid. Participants were up titrated to the target dose of sacubitril/valsartan, dose level 4 according to their tolerability. Visits 502, 503, 504 and 505, as applicable, were intended to be used for study drug up-titration and abbreviated safety follow-up at an interval of approximately 2 weeks between the visits (see figure 1). During that time, participants were required to be up titrated to the maximum tolerated  oral  dose  of  sacubitril/valsartan  with  a  goal  of  reaching  the  target  dose  of  3.1  mg/kg.  If  a participant was unable to tolerate up-titration to a higher sacubitril/valsartan dose level or at the discretion of the investigator, participants could be maintained on lower dose levels of sacubitril/valsartan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety assessment

Similar safety assessments as Study B2319 were performed, including AEs, TEAEs, SAEs, deaths, and AESI descriptions. In addition, and for the participants in Study B2319E1 and Study B2319, an analysis of growth during the exposure to sacubitril/valsartan was conducted using the collected measurements of the height in both studies. Each one of these values was subsequently used to calculate the corresponding HAZ scores. Analysis of height (i.e., absolute height value, z-score (HAZ) for height and age-adjusted percentile for height) was performed for the overall population and for participants in the 2-9 year old subgroup at each 12-month height measurement throughout Study B2319E1 and Study B2319.

Four datasets were constructed, each one composed of data points from participants in different portions of the core and/or the extension studies, as follows:

· Core LCZ696: the data points from participants who received sacubitril/valsartan during the core Study B2319 - exclusively during Study B2319.

· Core enalapril: the data points from participants who received enalapril during the core Study B2319 exclusively during Study B2319.

· Extension only: data points from participants who received sacubitril/valsartan during the extension Study B2319E1 - exclusively during Study B2319E1.

· Core + Extension: data points from participants who received either sacubitril/valsartan or enalapril during the  core  Study  B2319,  and  from  participants  who  received  sacubitril/valsartan  during  extension  Study B2319E1. The data points from these two studies were combined.

The observation window from baseline measurement to the last valid measurement in the core study, were categorized in 12, 24 and 36 months for the core, the extension study and the combination of core and extension  studies,  as  applicable.  An  additional  window  of  observation  was  defined  covering  the  entire participation of each of the participants during the study (called corresponding observation window).

For analyses of HAZ score in the 2-9 year old subgroup, the start of the observation window (baseline) was defined as the date of the first height-for-age z score value available after the participant turned 2 years old.

For analyses of the entire population, the start of the observation window for the entire population was defined  as  the  date  of  the  first  HAZ  score  value  available  (baseline).  Changes  from  the  end  of  the corresponding observation window to baseline were calculated and categorized. The end was defined as the date of the last HAZ assessment available. Participants with study treatment interruptions were included in  the  analyses  if  the  interruption  did  not  exceed  10%  of  the  treatment  duration.  Participants  only contributed data to the analysis if there were at least 2 HAZ score measurements during the observation window. Data from Part 1 of the core study were not used in the analyses.

Summary  statistics  for  HAZ  scores  by  yearly  visit  were  provided.  In  addition,  categorical  analyses  of decreases  in  HAZ  were  investigated  in  the  subpopulations  and  windows  of  observation  of  interest.  A decrease of at least one unit of Z score was considered clinically meaningful, as it would allow a change from one category to a worse one, among the categories mentioned above.

## 6.2.  Results

## Exposure:

The mean daily doses of sacubitril/valsartan were comparable between Study B2319E1 and Study B2319 and between age groups. As expected, the median duration of exposure to sacubitril/valsartan was longer in  Study  B2319E1  than  in  Study  B2319.  In  Study  B2319E1,  the  median  duration  of  exposure  to sacubitril/valsartan (including temporary interruptions) was 2.5 (IQR 1.8, 3.3) years and similar between the two age groups. As per protocol, the majority of participants completed the treatment greater than one year (194 participants; 90.23%). A total of 149 (69.30%) participants completed 2 years of treatment, 73 (33.95%) participants completed 3 years and 18 (8.37%) participants completed ≥ 4 years.

Treatment interruptions were in general short as shown by the small differences between the exposure of including and excluding treatment interruptions. In Study B2319E1, patient-years (PY) on treatment was 535.85.  After  week  6  in  Study  B2319E1,  the  36  (52.94%)  participants  were  on  dose  level  4  for sacubitril/valsartan (3.1 mg/kg bid). The median (interquartile range (IQR) Q1 and Q3) duration on dose level 4 was 827.50 days (498.00, 1107.50) for the entire study population.

A total of 24 (11.16%) of participants had at least one down titration. The most common reason for down titration was physician decision (12; 5.58%) and AEs (9; 4.19%). The number of participants with at least one dose interruption was 36 (16.74%) in entire study population. A total of 9 (4.19%) of participants reported at least one dose interruption exceeding 14 days. The most common reason for dose interruption was AE (23; 10.7%).

The median duration of exposure to sacubitril/valsartan (including temporary interruptions) was 911 days overall and similar between the two age groups. A total of 45 participants (20.93%) completed the oneyear treatment. A total of 76 (35.35%) participants completed 2 years of treatment, 55 (25.58%) participants completed 3 years and 18 (8.37%) participants completed ≥ 4 years. A total of 48 (22.33%) of participants who discontinued treatment early. Treatment interruptions were in general short as shown by the small differences between the exposure of including and excluding treatment interruptions. Overall patient-years (PY) on treatment was 535.85.

## Dispositions:

From the Study B2319, 106 participants from the enalapril, and 109 participants from the LCZ groups were enrolled in Study B2319E1. Overall, 218 participants were screened of which 2 participants were screen failures  and  3  participants  who  were  re-screened.  One  participant  was  randomized  into  the  B2319E1 (extension) study but didn't receive treatment and discontinued later from the study. Based on treatment disposition, a total of 215 participants received at least one dose of sacubitril/valsartan. Of 215 participants, 166  (77.21%)  completed  the  study.  The  primary  reason  for  discontinuing  study  drug  were  AEs  in  17 (7.91%) participants, physician decision in 13 (6.05%) participants, and death in 10 (4.65%) participants.

## Demographics:

In  Study  B2319E1,  the  mean  age  was  8.92  years.  There  were  106  males,  49.30%  and  109  females, 50.70%.  Race  of  participants  were  majority  White  (55.35%),  Asian  (21.86%),  and  Black  or  African American  (13.49%).  In  Study  B2319E1,  all  participants  in  both  the  age  groups  reported  at  least  one relevant  medical  history  or  current  medical  condition.  The  most  commonly  reported  relevant  medical histories were, as expected by being part of core Study B2319, cardiac disorders in 211 (98.14%) followed by  congenital,  familial,  and  genetic  disorders  in  68  (31.63%)  and  infection  and  infestation  in  49 (22.79%).The  most  common  cardiac  disorders  were  cardiac  failure  in  93  (43.26%)  and  dilated cardiomyopathy  in  90  (41.86%)  participants  and  the  most  common  congenital,  familial,  and  genetic disorders  were  non-compaction  cardiomyopathy  in  13  (6.05%)  and  atrial  septal  defect  in  10  (4.65%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

participants. In Study B2319E1, most participants in both age groups reported at least one concomitant medication, 1 of the 130 participants in the ≥ 6 year old age group reported no concomitant medication.

Heart failure and cardiovascular medications were the most commonly used medications consistent with the trial population. The most commonly used HF and cardiovascular medications were beta blockers in 170 (79.07%)  followed  by  aldosterone  antagonists  in  144  (66.98%)  and  diuretics  other  than  aldosterone antagonists (including spironolactone) in 140 (65.12%) of participants.

## Adverse events:

Overall, the number of participants with at least one TEAE was 187 (86.98%). At least one SAE was reported in 84 (39.07%) participants.  Over the longer duration of extension Study B2319E1 compared to core Study B2319, the general overall TEAE profile of sacubitril/valsartan was consistent between extension Study B2319E1 and core Study B2319, see tables below.

Overall, the most common PTs ( ≥ 15% participants) were COVID-19 in 55 (25.58%) participants, pyrexia in 41 (19.07%) participants and cough in 39 (18.14%) participants.

Age group 1 (6 to &gt;18 years): The  most common PTs ( ≥ 15% participants) were COVID-19 in 27 (20.77%) participants, and Cough in 20 (15.38%) participants.

Age group 2 (1 to 6 years): The most common PTs ( ≥ 15% participants) were COVID-19 in 28 (32.94%) participants,  Pyrexia  in  24  (28.24%)  participants,  Upper  respiratory  tract  infection  in  22  (25.88%) participants, Cough in 19 (22.35%) participants, Nasopharyngitis in 14 (16.47%) participants and Vomiting in 13 (15.29%) participants.

TEAEs by PT occurring in at least 5% of participants in any treatment group are shown for Study B2319E1 and  Study  B2319  below.  Various  TEAEs  by  PT  had  lower  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rate  (EAIR)  in

## Potential relationship of adverse events to study drug

Overall, 34 (15.81%) participants reported at least one AE related to study drug. The most common AEs by PT (&gt; 2% participants) related to study drug were Hypotension in 16 (7.44%) and Hyperkalemia in 5 (2.33%) participants

Age group 1 (6 to &gt;18 years): The number of participants with at least one AE related to study drug was 26 (20.00%). The most common AEs by PT (&gt; 3% participants) related to study drug were Hypotension in 13 (10.00%), Hyperkalemia in 4 (3.08%) and Dizziness in 4 (3.08%) Participants.

Age group 2 (1 to 6 years): The number of participants with at least one AE related to study drug was 8 (9.41%) in age group 2. The most common AE by PT (&gt; 3% participants) related to study drug was Hypotension in 3 (3.53%) participants.

The number of participants with SAEs related to study drug was 5 (3.85%) in age group 1. All the SAEs by PTs related to study drug were: Acute kidney injury and Hyperkalemia in 1 participant, renal impairment in 1 participant, acute kidney injury and Hypotension in 1 participant, cardiac failure in 1 participant and presyncope in 1 participant. Only 1 (1.18%) participant in age group 2 reported SAEs (cardiac failure and hypotension) related to study drug

In the Study B2319E1, there was no indication of increased or changed rates of these AEs compared to Study B2319.

## Deaths:

Overall, the number of participants with at least one TEAE leading to death was 11 (5.12%) participants. The primary cause for death during treatment period was study indication in 4 (1.86%) participants. The number of deaths was comparable between B2319E1 and B2319, see table below.

The primary cause of death across Study B2319 and Study B2319E1 combined was the study indication in 4 (1.07%) and congestive heart failure in 7 (1.87%) participants. Between the cohorts, similar AEs lead to deaths at similar rates. In both Study B2319 and Study B2319E1, there were 9 non-CV deaths, the primarily cause of which was respiratory failure, affecting 4 (1.07%) participants. Review of the deaths in extension Study B2319E1  indicated that most participants had underlying contributing comorbidities and complications associated with their cardiac disease.

## Adverse events of special interest

The adverse events of special interest for sacubitril/valsartan in pediatric patients with HF remains consistent to the previously reported safety profile with sacubitril/valsartan reported in Study B2319. In general, these safety topics presented similarly in the 2 age groups compared to the overall population. See table below for comparison between the studies.

## Long-term effects on growth, and bone growth and mineralization in the pediatric population

## Adverse events related to change in bone growth and density

In Study B2319E1, AEs related to change in bone growth and density were reported in 9 participants (4.19%) with exposure adjusted incidence rate (EAIR) of 1.691 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.773, 3.211) per 100 PTY. All the AEs by PT were reported in 1 participant each.

Two participants reported severe AEs of which one participant in age group 2 had SAE. Both the severe AEs were not related to study drug.

Age group 1: AEs related to change in bone growth and density were reported in 6 (4.62%) participants with EAIR of 1.925 (95% CI 0.706, 4.189) per 100 PY. One participant reported Foot fracture which was severe but was not related to study drug.

Age group 2: AEs related to change in bone growth and density were reported in 3 participants (3.53%) in age group 2 with EAIR of 1.361 (95% CI 0.281, 3.978) per 100 PY. One participant reported Femur fracture which was severe but was not related to study drug

The review of AEs related to the risk of long-term effects on growth, bone growth, and mineralization in the pediatric population showed higher number and proportion of participants presenting with a fracture in the extension study compared to the core study (4.19% vs. 1.07%, respectively). This difference is likely due to the longer duration of follow-up of the extension study, and still represents a low fracture rate overall. The EAIR of these AE in both studies are similar: 1.080 (95% CI 0.130, 3.900) vs 1.691 (95% CI 0.770, 3.210) per 100 PY in core and extension studies respectively. Of note, most of these fractures were apparently due to accidental trauma and none of them were considered related to study drug.

## Height analyses datasets

The height measurements collected at each 12-month height measurement throughout Study B2319E1 and Study B2319 (Part 2 only) were used to analyse height-for-age z-scores (HAZ), for the overall population and for the age subgroup of 2-9 years, an age range with linear growth. The numbers of participants contributing to the numerical and categorical analyses of HAZ change from the core + extension study populations for the observation windows, for the overall population and for the 2-9 year old subgroup are shown below. Although the longest term data for the largest population are of key interest for assessment of a potential effect on growth, the trends across the populations and observation windows are considered below.

## Height analyses numerical (Height-for-age z-scores)

The baseline HAZ shows a slightly negative value for all cohorts, which is consistent with literature assessing similar pediatric populations. (Bannister et al 2010 and van der Meulen et al 2021). Across the windows of observation and for the overall population as well as the subgroup of 2-9 year-old participants, the median HAZ changes were close to zero.

Participants whose duration of exposure from start of observation window to EOT is less than 36 months were excluded from analysis set.

The start of the observation window is the date of the first HAZ value available (base). The end of the observation window occurs (36 months + 15 days) after its start.

Post = the last HAZ value available during the observation window.

LCZ696 (core only) and Enalapril (core only) participant data were not included in this table because the study concluded after 12 months.

n: number of participants of interest. LCl: 95% Lower Confidence. Limit. UCl: 95% Upper Confidence Limit.

The analyses based on the 36-months window of observation included 109 participants in the Core + Extension cohort including the entire population. The changes of HAZ from baseline were around zero, with the largest decline being 1.88 in the Extension only subgroup including the entire population (first quartile -0.47, n=68). The most useful of these analyses  is the one conducted in the Core + Extension entire population cohort (n=109), where the median HAZ change was 0.08 (IQR -0.35, 0.60) in Table 8. This result points against the existence of a negative effect in growth in participants exposed to sacubitril/valsartan for at least 36 months.

The analyses based on the 24-months window of exposure naturally included a higher number of participants than the ones based on the 36-months window of exposure. The largest contribution came from the entire population Core + Extension cohort (n=171). In this analysis, the median HAZ change from baseline was 0.08 (IQR -0.31,0.63), therefore indicating a HAZ increase.

The analysis based on the 12-months window of exposure included more participants than the 24- and 36-months windows of exposure. The entire population Core + Extension cohort included the highest number of participants (n=162). The median HAZ change from baseline for this cohort was 0.05 (IQR 0.20, 0.42), therefore indicating a slight HAZ increase.

## Categorical Analysis of height change

The analyses based on the corresponding window conducted with the cohorts related exclusively to the core study showed a very limited number of cases presenting with a clinically meaningful HAZ decrease, see table below. Only 3 patients (1%) had a decrease &gt;=2 units, representing a growth deficit according to the WHO cutoffs. Overall, all these analyses provide no evidence of an association between exposure to either enalapril or sacubitril/valsartan and the occurrence of growth deficit.

N = number of SAF patients having both base and post values.

In the analysis using a 12-month window of observation and the entire population, the proportion of participants presenting with a clinically meaningful HAZ decrease was very small across all the cohorts. These proportions increase slightly when only participants aged 2 to 9 years are considered. However, the increases are more pronounced in those cohorts with limited number of cases. Overall, those proportions are based on one to a maximum of four participants presenting with the decrease. In the analyses using a 24-month window of observation with the entire population or the subset aged 2 to 9 years, the proportions of participants presenting with a HAZ decrease from 1 to &lt; 2 units ranged from 2.25% to 4.35%, based on 2 to 7 participants. The proportions were even smaller (0.72 to 4.49%, based on 1 or 4 participants) for HAZ decreases ≥ 2 units. In the analyses using a 36-month window of observation with the entire population or the subset aged 2 to 9 years, the proportions of participants presenting with a HAZ decrease from 1 to &lt; 2 units ranged from 5.41% to 11.01%, based on 2 to 12 participants No participants had a HAZ decrease ≥ 2 units. See the table below.

## Weight

At baseline, the median weight-adjusted percentile was 51.93 (IQR 18.69, 81.86) for the entire study population, 55.25 (IQR 18.94,89.18) for age group 1 and 45.49 (IQR 18.26,72.25) for age group 2. The median change from baseline of that parameter at 24 months was -0.16 (IQR - 8.92,6.24), -0.80 (IQR 11.08,3.69), and 0.67 (IQR -8.21,11.61), respectively. At EOS, those values were 0 (IQR -9.07,9.80), 0.37 (IQR -8.85,3.36), and 2.72 (IQR -9.38,14.00), respectively

## Head circumference

The measurements were taken only for age group 2 for participants ≤ 3 years of age. At baseline, the median head circumference was 47 cm (IQR 46.00, 49.00), at month 24 the median change from baseline was 2 cm (IQR 1.65, 3.15) and at EOS the median change from baseline was 2 cm (IQR 1.00, 3.00).

## 6.3.  Discussion

The Applicant has completed study B2319E1, an open-label long-term extension study of the core Study B2319 in pediatric patients aged ≥ 13 months to 18 years with HF due to LVSD. Of the 215 participants in this extension study, 109 had received sacubitril/valsartan in the core Study B2319. The median (IQR) duration of exposure to sacubitril/valsartan was 2.5 (1.8, 3.3) years. In core Study B2319, the median (IQR) duration of exposure was 1.0 (0.98, 1.03) year.

Overall, AEs and SAEs were lower in extension Study B2319E1 than in core Study B2319. Potential reasons for lower AEs and SAEs are better HF control due to treatment over time, or  participants who were most likely to experience events may have discontinued from core Study B2319 and/or been less likely to enroll in Study B2319E1, so called 'depletion of susceptibles'. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the lower frequency of visits compared to core Study B2319 may have played a role in the lower exposure-adjusted rates of AEs and SAEs. In particular, there was a lower proportion of more severe and acute cardiac-related AEs/SAEs vs. a higher proportion of more chronic AEs/SAEs in extension Study B2319E1 than in core Study B2319, favoring the potential explanation that participants receiving sacubitril/valsartan long-term may have had better compensated HF.

The tolerability of sacubitril/valsartan in extension Study B2319E1 was consistent with (or somewhat better than) that observed in core Study B2319. A review of deaths in extension Study B2319E1 showed most participants  had  underlying  contributing  comorbidities  and  complications  associated  with  their  cardiac disease, consistent with the results of core Study B2319.

## Growth, bone growth and mineralization.

The  fracture  cases  from  the  AESI  of  Change  in  bone  growth  and  density  were  low  in  frequency  and consistently associated with accidental trauma in both extension Study B2319E1 and core Study B2319. Additionally, fractures in extension Study B2319E1 were not clustered around a particular timepoint, but rather throughout the study duration and the EAIRs between both studies are consistent, not supporting a negative effect in bone mineralization over time with sacubitril/valsartan exposure. Apart from fractures, no actual mineralization data was available.

Poor growth is prevalent in children with HF (Avitzur et al 2003), and malnutrition (undernutrition) can be common in pediatric HF due to multiple factors (Bannister et al 2010, Hollander 2019, Onalo et al 2021). Few studies have investigated course of growth in children with heart diseases (Bannister et al 2010, Aguilar et al 2015, Dennis et al 2016, Castleberry et al 2018, van der Meulen et al 2021, Brief et al 2022). The use of anthropometric z scores has proved a valuable means to identify and describe children with malnutrition (Bouma 2017). Height-for-age z (HAZ) scores are generally accepted as a preferred metric for this type of analysis in comparison to absolute measures of height, allowing meaningful comparisons of values within and between individuals over time, enabling a standardization of values that cannot be derived from the use of absolute height values (Indrayan 2014). Growth deficit can be categorized adapting the criteria established by the World Health Organization and the Consensus Statement of the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics/American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition. Growth deficit was absent if HAZ &gt; -2. Moderate growth deficit was defined as a HAZ ≤ -2 to &gt; -3. Severe growth deficit was defined as a HAZ of ≤ -3 (WHO 1995, Bouma 2014, American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 2015, Becker et al 2015). The reference for calculating HAZ in this study was the WHO growth standards (WHO 2022), which is endorsed. Analyses of changes in HAZ enabled meaningful comparisons over time of growth within and between individuals, enabling a standardization of values that cannot be derived from the use of  absolute  height  values.  Median changes from baseline in HAZ were close to zero for all windows of observation, for the individual studies and combined analyses, suggesting no significant change in growth. The  subgroup  of  2-9-year-old  participants,  the  age  range  expected  to  experience  linear  growth,  also exhibited median changes in HAZ close to zero. There were only a few participants with clinically meaningful

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

decreases in HAZ. Overall, there was no evidence for a negative effect of sacubitril/valsartan exposure on growth in pediatric patients with HF due to LVSD.

Overall, the final safety results from long-term, open-label extension Study B2319E1 were consistent with the  safety  results  for  the  sacubitril/valsartan  treatment  arm  in  the  core  Study  B2319  and  with  the extensively evaluated safety profile of sacubitril/valsartan in adults and pediatric patients. There was no negative effect  of  long-term  exposure  to  sacubitril/valsartan  in  extension  Study  B2319E1  compared  to shorter-term data from core Study B2319 on growth or bone growth and mineralization, or any other safety topic assessed. No new or unknown safety signal was observed.

In conclusion, 1) the safety profile of sacubitril/valsartan observed in this study is consistent with the one observed in the PANORAMA-HF core study and described in the labelling, 2) there is no evidence that the long-term exposure of children with HF to sacubitril/valsartan has negative effects on their growth, bone growth or mineralization, and 3) the benefit risk profile of sacubitril/valsartan in the pediatric population remains positive.

| Long-term effects on growth, bone growth and mineralization in the pediatric population Important potential risk | Routine PV No additional risk minimization activities No additional PV activities | This safety concern was thoroughly assessed in Studies PANORAMA- HF and PANORAMA-HF OLE in pediatric HF patients. PANORAMA- HF (52-week study) did not show evidence that sacubitril/valsartan has an impact on body weight, height, head circumference and fracture rate. PANORAMA-HF OLE (long-term study) showed no evidence of adverse effects on (bone) growth or fracture rates associated with the exposure to sacubitril/valsartan up to 4.5 years. |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The risk is appropriately addressed in the SmPC. There are currently no additional risk minimization or PV activities in place for this safety concern.

It will continue to be monitored and reviewed in the next PSUR.

## PRAC Rapporteur's assessment comment

The WSA's rationale for the removal of 'Long-term effects on growth, bone growth and mineralization in the pediatric population' as an important potential risk from the RMP is consistent with the CHMP Rapporteur's assessment conclusion and therefore acceptable. The RMP has been updated satisfactorily to reflect this change throughout the document.

## PRAC Rapporteur's assessment comment

Following the removal of the CLCZ696B2319E1 study to evaluate Long-term effects on growth, bone growth and mineralization in the pediatric population, only two studies remain in the PhV plan, i.e. the two Category 3 non-interventional PASS CLCZ696B2014 and CLCZ696B2015.

The PhV plan was updated to reflect a further 6 months delay to the end milestones for the EU Category 3 non-interventional PASS CLCZ696B2014 and CLCZ696B2015, thus constituting an overall delay of two

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

years relative to the original plan. The due date for the submission of the final reports is now 31 Dec 2024.

As justification for these milestone changes, the MAH refers to a correspondence with the EMA which included an informal acceptance by PRAC Rapporteur of the further delay. Since a formal confirmation by the PRAC is still pending within this procedure, the MAH is requested to provide the pdf document, i.e., the document attached to the email sent to the EMA on 15 May 2024, with the justification for the 6 months delay to be available for assessment within this procedure. (OC)

## 8.3.  Overall conclusion on the RMP

The changes to the RMP could be acceptable provided satisfactory responses to the request for supplementary information in section 5 are submitted.

The MAH is reminded that in case of a Positive Opinion, the body of the RMP and Annexes 4 and 6 (as applicable) will be published on the EMA website at the time of the EPAR publication, so considerations should be given on the retention/removal of Personal Data (PD) and identification of Commercially Confidential Information (CCI) in any updated RMP submitted throughout this procedure.

## 9.  Changes to the Product Information

The Applicant proposes to update section 4.8 and section 5.3 of the SmPC. See also the PI document attached as proposed by the Applicant including the CHMP Rapporteur's assessment. The assessment is provided  in  the  PI  of  Entresto.  The  same  assessment  applies  to  Neparvis.  See  separate  document  for comments on the proposed changes to the SmPC.

## 10.  Request for supplementary information

## 10.1.  Major objections

## Clinical aspects

None

## RMP aspects

None.

## 10.2.  Other concerns

## Clinical aspects

1. See attached SmPC assessment for comments on the changes to section 4.8.
2. For the overall summary of treatment emergent adverse events (Table 1 and 2 in this report), the frequencies are shown, but not the incidences. Considering the differing study durations, data on the incidence rates would be more useful to compare the safety results. The Applicant is therefore

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

requested to modify these tables to demonstrate not only the frequency but also the incidence rates.

## RMP aspects

3. The MAH is requested to provide the pdf document attached to the email sent to the EMA on 15 May 2024, with the justification for the 6 months delay of the two Category 3 non-interventional PASS CLCZ696B2014 and CLCZ696B2015 to be available for assessment within this procedure.

## Clinical aspects

## Question 1

See attached SmPC assessment for comments on the changes to section 4.8.

## Summary of the WSA's response

The proposed edits are accepted and the SmPC was updated accordingly.

## Assessment of the WSA's response

The proposed edits were accepted. Issue resolved.

## Question 2

For the overall summary of treatment emergent adverse events (Table 1 and 2 in this report), the frequencies are shown, but not the incidences. Considering the differing study durations, data on the incidence rates would be more useful to compare the safety results. The Applicant is therefore requested to modify these tables to demonstrate not only the frequency but also the incidence rates.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Summary of the WSA's response

The tables were updated accordingly.

## Assessment of the WSA's response

The Applicant has modified these concerned tables by demonstrating not only the frequency but also the incidence rates. These tables can be found in section 6.2 of this report. Issue resolved.

## Conclusion

Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly

No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance

## RMP aspects

## Question 3

The MAH is requested to provide the pdf document attached to the email sent to the EMA on 15 May 2024, with the justification for the 6 months delay of the two Category 3 non-interventional PASS CLCZ696B2014 and CLCZ696B2015 to be available for assessment within this procedure.

## Summary of the WSA's response

The PDF document is provided as an annex. In the document the MAH informs about a data extraction issue originating from the Spanish database, SIDIAP, as the cause of the delay.

## Assessment of the WSA's response

The MAH's proposal to postpone the milestones by 6 months have been considered, and the further delay of the final reports can be accepted. We do not consider it necessary for the MAH to submit another interim report before the final reports due 31 December 2024.

Issue resolved.

## Conclusion

Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly

No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance
