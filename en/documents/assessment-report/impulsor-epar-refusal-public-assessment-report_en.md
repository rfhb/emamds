## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1. Introduction

This  application  concerns  a  centralised  procedure  for  Impulsor  25  mg,  50  mg,  100  mg  hard capsules (EMEA/H/C/1034) submitted for Marketing Authorisation in the EU and is submitted under Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC (as amended) as a known active substance.

Milnacipran belongs to the class of nor epinephrine serotonin reuptake inhibitors (NSRIs) that exert their  effects  by  preferentially  inhibiting  the  reuptake  of  NE  over  5-HT  and  is  indicated  for  the treatment  of  Fibromyalgia  syndrome  (FMS),  a  chronic  rheumatological  disorder  characterized  by widespread musculoskeletal pain, tenderness, fatigue, sleep disorders and a constellation of symptoms such as cognition troubles, morning stiffness and mood disturbances.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## Introduction

Impulsor medicinal product contains the known active substance Milnacipran hydrochloride. The product is available as hard capsules in the following strengths: 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg. The hard capsules are packed into either polypropylene bottles or PVC/ACLAR/Al blisters.

## Active Substance

The active substance is not reported in any pharmacopoeia.

The active substance Milnacipran hydrochloride has been developed by Pierre Fabre Médicament. Its manufacture is performed since more than ten years by Pierre Fabre Médicament. The manufacturing process, the specifications and the analytical methods have been transferred to another manufacturer. Complete Active Substance Master Files for both manufacturers have been submitted (no. 2024 and no. 2025, version May 2008). Letters of access as well as the applicant parts of the ASMF have been included in the dossier.

Milnacipran (INN) or C15H23ClN2O possesses the following structure as described below. Physical and chemical characteristics such as appearance, solubility, hygroscopicity (non hygroscopic), pKa-value, potential isomerism, partition coefficient, polymorphism and particle size have been studied.

<!-- image -->

## · Manufacture

The  details  of  the  manufacture  and  the  process  controls  of  milnacipran  hydrochloride  have  been described in the restricted part of the ASMF.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elucidation of structure

The structure of Milnacipran hydrochloride has been confirmed by elemental analysis (C, H and N), spectroscopic analyses (IR-, UV-, 1 H-NMR-,  13 C-NMR-, mass spectrometry) and X-ray diffraction studies. Satisfactory spectra have been provided.

Potential isomerism: The manufacturing process can only generate the required cis racemic isomers (milnacipran). The trans isomers can only be obtained using a different synthesis pathway or by stress studies under forced exposure to light

Polymorphism: Milnacipran does not show any polymorphism showing that the obtained crystalline form  is thermodynamically  stable. X-ray  diffraction studies for batches synthesised by  both manufacturers are identical. This has been confirmed by X-rray diffraction and DCS analysis.

Impurities: Potential impurities of Milnacipran hydrochloride such as starting materials, synthesis intermediates, synthesis impurities, degradation products, inorganic impurities, residual solvents and microbiological contamination have been comprehensively discussed. Investigations have been performed in order to detect, identify and quantitate impurities present in Milnacipran hydrochloride.

The microbiological contamination was carried out on ten consecutive industrial batches using Ph.Eur. methods 2.6.12 and 2.6.13. All the industrial batches meet the Ph.Eur. requirements. Based on those results it is justified not to include a routine test of microbiological contamination.

- Specification

Appropriate specification has been set for the active substance and includes the following parameters: appearance, solubility (PhEur), identification (chloride, IR, optical rotation), appearance of the solution (PhEur), water content  (PhEur), sulfated ash (PhEur), heavy metals (PhEur), residulal solvents (GC), related substances (TLC and HPLC), assay (HPLC). The specification is considered adequate to control the quality of the drug substance.

The methods used for analysing the active substance have been appropriately described and the validations of the analytical procedures are adequate and in accordance with EU/ICH validation guidelines.

Results from three consecutive production batches of Milnacipran hydrochloride have been presented from  each  manufacturer.  All  batches  comply  with  the  proposed  specification  and  demonstrate  the consistent quality of material.

Adequate justification of specification has been provided. The specifications have been set based on commercial batch data and in accordance with guideline ICH Q6A and with Ph.Eur.  In particular the limits sets for the related substances are in line with the guideline ICH Q3A. Also, the limits for the residual solvents are fully in line with ICH recommendations.

For each manufacturer, description of the container used for the active substance has been presented. Adequate tests including appearance and identification of the packaging material have been carried out. The packaging materials comply with relevant EU Directives (food contact requirements in 2002/72/EC) and with Ph.Eur. monographs 3.1.3, 3.1.4 and 3.2.2. Furthermore a certificate stating that materials did not use substances of animal or human origin has been provided and therefore no TSE risk is foreseen.

- Stability

## Forced degradation studies

Stability  under  forced  degradation  conditions  (temperature,  light,  humidity,  oxidation,  acid,  basic) were  performed  on  one  industrial  batch.  Results  showed  that  the  active  substance  was  sensitive  to humidity, acid and basic conditions but stable when exposed to temperature and oxidation. Photostability studies were performed on one batch in line with ICHQ1B conditions and the results show that the active substance is stable when exposed to light.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Long term and accelerated storage conditions

Stability data are presented for three industrial batches kept in the commercial packaging after storage at  25 o C/60%RH (up to 48 months) and 40 o C/75%RH (6 months) in line with ICH guidelines. The following parameters were monitored: appearance, appearance of the solution, water content, related substances, and assay. The analytical methods used for the stability studies are the same are those used for the control of the active substance and been validated.

The stability data show that the drug substance is stable under long term and accelerated storage conditions over the period tested. All parameters tested in the stability studies remained within the specified limits. Based on the stability data for both manufacturers, a re-test period of 48 months is proposed when stored in the proposed packaging.

## Medicinal Product

Impulsor 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg hard capsules contain milnacipran hydrochloride as the active substance and  the following excipients: calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate as diluent, carmellose calcium  as  disintegrant,  povidone  as  binder,  silica  hydrophobic  colloidal  as  glidant,  magnesium stearate  as  lubricant,  and  talc  as  anti-adherent.  All  the  excipients  used  are  commonly  used  as pharmaceutical excipients in solid dosage forms.

The capsules shell contain titanium oxide (E171), quinoline yellow (E104), sunset yellow (E110) and gelatin for the cap, and the body.

All excipients are compendial and controlled according to the requirements of the respective Ph. Eur. except for gelatin capsules. Certificates of analysis of each excipient have been provided.  Satisfactory specifications for the capsule shells are provided and the test procedures are in line with Ph Eur. The colouring agents of the capsule comply with the specifications of the European Directive 95/45/EC of July 25, 1995 and amendments thereafter.

The hard capsules are packed into either polypropylene bottles or PVC/ACLAR/Al blisters.

## · Pharmaceutical Development

## The pharmaceutical development has been adequately described

The choice of the active substance based on its physicochemical properties and the excipients were justified.  The  excipients  selected  in  the  proposed  formulation  demonstrated  no  incompatibility  and ensure  good  stability.  The  levels  used  for  the  excipients  are  typical  for  fast-dissolving  capsule formulations.  During  the  pharmaceutical  development,  all  the  formulations  were  found  to  be bioequivalent with no food effect. The formulation used in pivotal Phase III studies is identical to the proposed commercial formulation.

For convenience of administration and precision of dosage, the capsule was the selected dosage form. Capsules usually exhibit good stability, a high dosage precision and ensure taste masking.

Due to the physical properties of milnacipran hydrochloride (very poor flowability, and low bulk density) the use of a wet granulation process was preferred.

## There are no manufacturing overages.

Due  to  high  aqueous  solubility  of  the  drug  substance  and  chosen  manufacturing  process  (wet granulation) there is no impact of particle size on dissolution profiles. This is accepted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Adventitious Agents

The magnesium stearate used is of vegetable origin. Gelatin used for the manufacture of the hard capsules is obtained by three possible suppliers. For each of the suppliers a valid TSE-Certifcate of suitability is presented. Therefore it is not anticipated to have any risk in relation to the TSE.

A satisfactory TSE declaration for magnesium state is provided. Satisfactory current certificates of suitability for gelatin are provided.

## · Manufacture of the Product

## Manufacturing process

The manufacture of the hard capsules consists of a wet granulation process. Satisfactory flow diagram detailing  the  manufacturing  process  and  in-process  control  testing  has  been  provided  as  well  as  a summary of the process. In brief, the API and excipients are mixed by and wet granulated, sieved, and lubricating agents added and filled into capsules.

## In-process controls

The control of critical steps in the manufacture is highlighted in the manufacture flow diagram. The critical acceptance criteria include drying, mass uniformity and disintegration. This is accepted.

## Process validation

Process validation for three commercial batches of each strength has been conducted in accordance with the EU guideline and Note for guidance ICH Q8. All process data are within specifications and showed that the manufacturing process is reliable and consistent.

## · Product Specification

Satisfactory product specification at release and shelf-life for the 25mg, 50 mg, 100mg have been established and the following tests are included: appearance, identification of the active substance (HPLC/TLC), average mass (PhEur), dissolution (PhEur), uniformity of dosage unit by content uniformity (PhEur), assay of the active substance (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), microbial examination (PhEur).

Full justifications are provided for all specifications which are in line with Ph Eur and limits are in compliance with ICH guidelines.

Methods have been fully described and validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.

Satisfactory  batch  data  for  three  batches  for  each  strength  have  been  provided.  All  data  are  within specifications.

The finished product is packed in either

- polyvinylchloride (PVC)/chlorotrifluoroethylene (ACLAR) aluminum blister or
- a polypropylene pill bottle with a LDPE cap.

The secondary packaging is a printed cardboard box, including the leaflet.

Satisfactory  specifications  and  certificates  of  analysis  have  been  provided.  The  primary  packaging components are conform to the EU food contact requirements in Directive 2002/72/EC and the PhEur. The  compatibility  of  the  capsules  with  the  primary  packaging  systems  has  been  demonstrated  by stability data.

## · Stability of the Product

Stability studies have been carried out on on two industrial scale batches of Impulsor 20 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg hard capsules kept in the two different commercial packaging (blisters or bottle) under

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ICH conditions (up to 12 months at 25 °C/60% RH, 30 °C/65% RH , with bottles: 30°C/75%RH and for 6 months at 40 °C/75% RH).

Stability samples were tested for: characteristics, identification of milnacipran hydrochloride (HPLC), average mass of content, disintegration, dissolution, uniformity of dosage unit, related substances, microbiological examination, and assay of milnacipran hydrochloride content. The methods used were those used in the release specification for the finished product.

No significant changes were observed after storage under long term conditions and no essential trends were detectable.  The product remained stable throughout the stability studies.

Forced degradation studies (heat, humidity) were conducted on one batch (25 mg) and showed that milnacipran is sensitive to heat and humidity.

Photostability studies in accordance with ICH Q1B requirements were carried out on two batches (25 mg  and  100  mg).  The  characteristics,  dissolution  test,  assay  of  milnacipran  hydrochloride  and impurities contents were tested and demonstrated the product is stable for 1 month.

In use stability for the pill bottle were carried on one batch (25 mg). Conditions of use were simulated (daily  opening  of  the  pill  bottle  stored  at  30°C/75  %  RH  during  7  days).    The  characteristics, dissolution test, assay of milnacipran  hydrochloride  and  impurities  contents were  tested  and demonstrated the product is stable for 1 month.

It can be concluded that the stability results support the shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC when the product is kept in the commercial packaging.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The information presented is acceptable and sufficient to guarantee the quality of Impulsor 25, 50, 100 mg capsules. The data submitted on the quality of the drug substance and drug products reflect  well  researched  and  well  defined  products.  The  development  program  has  taken  into account the current directives and CHMP guidelines relevant to this application.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Milnacipran is intended to be used for the treatment of fibromyalgia, a disorder which is characterized by the presence of chronic musculoskeletal pain, allodynia, sleep disturbances and a variety of other symptoms. At present no validated preclinical models of the fibromyalgia syndrome exists. Therefore, preclinical evaluation of milnacipran in FMS is directed to assess the drug effect on leading symptoms of the disease, i.e. chronic pain, sleep disturbances and mood abnormalities.

## GLP

Most of the safety pharmacology studies were done more than 25 years ago which also means that they are not compliant with GLP. Among the 31 studies presented in this section only 14 fulfil the GLP  requirements. However,  the most critical studies were done in accordance  with  GLP requirements. Taking into account that data quality and integrity of safety pharmacology studies were ensured  and  are  documented  by  quality  assurance  statements  included  in  the  respective  studies, concerns due to non-compliance in some of these studies do not arise.

All pivotal toxicity studies were conducted in compliance with GLP regulations.

## Pharmacology

## · Primary pharmacodynamics

Milnacipran was shown to inhibit effectively the uptake of both NE and 5-HT in neuronal as well as non-neuronal tissues. These properties were demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo in  a  number  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

experimental  setups,  and  many  of  the  therapeutic  effects  of  milnacipran,  including  its  analgesic properties, are possibly based on this mechanism of action.

Milnacipran was tested in a variety of animal models of pain. Generally, the analgesic activity of the drug in rats and mice was moderate at best. The effect was more pronounced in models were chronic (neuropathic) pain was investigated.

Similar  to  clinically  established  NE  and  5-HT  reuptake  inhibitors,  milnacipran  showed  strong antidepressant activities in a variety of animal models (e.g. bulbectomized rats, PORSOLT test, tail suspension test, helplessness behaviour of mice).

Milnacipran  caused  only  slight  modifications  in  sleep  parameters  in  rats  and  did  not  show  any anorectic activity.

Summarizing it can be concluded that milnacipran displayed pharmacological activities which were similar  to  clinically  established  antidepressants.  Whether  the  observed  moderate  activity  found  in chronic  pain  models  is  of  clinical  relevance  is  a  matter  of  clinical  evaluation.  With  respect  to  the mechanism of action some data were reported which suggest that the analgesic effects might be related to inhibition of NE and 5-HT uptake at the supraspinal level. Primary pharmacodynamic data obtained from  non-clinical  species  do  not  allow  concluding  safely  that  milnacipran  alleviates  symptoms  of FMS.

## · Safety pharmacology programme

Safety pharmacology of milnacipran was extensively studied in a variety of in vivo and in vitro tests. Most of these studies were done more than 25 years ago which also means that they were not GLP compliant.  Among  the  31  studies  presented  in  this  section  only  14  fulfil  the  GLP  requirements. However,  the  most  critical  studies  were  done  in  accordance  with  GLP  requirements.  Taking  into account  that  data  quality  and  integrity  of  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  ensured  and  are documented by quality assurance statements included in the respective studies, concerns due to noncompliance in some of these studies do not arise.

Binding  affinities  of  milnacipran  were  investigated  on  a  variety  of  molecular  targets  (receptors, enzymes, ion channels, transporters). High affinity binding (taking 50% inhibition as a criterion) was only found to NE and 5-HT-transporters.

At the behavioural level milnacipran was evaluated in different species and routes of administration. The general behaviour of mice, rats and monkeys was not affected in therapeutically relevant doses.

Moreover,  milnacipran  showed  no  major  effects  on  convulsions  or  memory,  and  no  adverse cholinergic  activity  was  observed.  Furthermore,  milnacipran  exhibited  no  psychological  or  physical dependence liability in monkeys.

The effect of milnacipran on blood pressure and heart rate has been studied in rats, dogs and monkeys under various conditions. Milnacipran exhibited complex effects on the cardiovascular system. In rats milnacipran  increased  blood  pressure  during  intravenous  infusion.  In  dogs  and  monkeys,  lower milnacipran doses usually increased blood pressure, while at higher doses, a decrease was noted. The observed  hypertensive  activity  of  milnacipran  was  thought  to  be  related  to  the  inhibition  of neurotransmitter  reuptake  (i.e.,  the  proposed  mechanism  of  action  of  milnacipran).  A  concomitant decrease in heart rate was attributed to reactive response of the vagus. Changes in QTc interval in dogs and monkeys were minor or not related to milnacipran dosing.

The effect of milnacipran on HERG channel activity was studied in stable transfected HEK293 cells by patch-clamp technique. Up to 10 µM milnacipran was without any effect; however, a statistically significant  inhibition  in  HERG  tail  current  was  observed  at  target  concentration  of  30  µM.  This concentration is far higher than the efficacious concentration determined for the inhibition of NE and 5-HT uptake in vitro (10-200 nM). Taken together, the pronounced effects on blood pressure and heart rate  in  therapeutically  relevant  doses  might  compromise  cardio-vascular  safety.  However,  in  the monkey there exists a sufficient safety margin with respect to side effects on blood pressure and heart rate. Additionally, special warnings and precautions for use were included in the SPC recommending close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate in all patients.

Milnacipran showed no significant respiratory and urogenital effects at therapeutically relevant doses. A prokinetic effect on the gastrointestinal tract of dogs and sheep may be attributed to inhibition of 5HT uptake by milnacipran. In monkeys, milnacipran showed no effects on the gastrointestinal system.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Milnacipran  was  also  tested  for  drug-drug  interactions  with  of  drugs  that  exhibit  central  nervous system or cardiovascular activity. In most studies, no prohibitive interactions were observed. In mice, milnacipran exacerbated motor impairment induced by TCAs and other compounds that affect the NE and  5-HT  systems  and  also  potentiated  the  activity  of  pentobarbital  and  haloperidol.  Furthermore, milnacipran lowered the dose of digoxin that produced extra systoles, tachyarrhythmias, and cardiac arrest  in  anaesthetised  guinea  pigs.  However,  in  a  clinical  trial  in  healthy  human  volunteers,  no interactions were observed between milnacipran and digoxin at therapeutic levels of both compounds.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic profile of milnacipran was evaluated in vitro as well as in vivo. In vivo studies were performed in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and monkey.

The  bioanalytical  methods  used  for  the  determination  of  plasma  (mice,  rats,  monkeys)  or  urine  ( monkeys ), concentrations of milnacipran and its potential metabolites have been fully validated and were  developed  for  the  quantification  of  either  unchanged  milnacipran  (as  racemate  or  single enantiomers) and potential  metabolites.  Most of the pharmacokinetic studies  in non-clinical species were performed using 14 C-milnacipran. Total radioactivity (including parent compound and metabolites) was quantified through liquid scintillation counting.

Absorption of milnacipran was evaluated in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. Results of these studies suggest rapid absorption of milnacipran after oral  administration to animals. The rate of absorption varied from 63 to 77% depending on the species. Following single oral administration of milnacipran to  mice,  rats  and  monkeys,  plasma  concentrations  of  milnacipran  increased  to  reach  concentration peaks between 0.17 and 0.5 hours in rodents and between 1.6 and 4 hours in monkeys. The absolute bioavailability was 61% in rats. Plasma concentrations of unchanged milnacipran decreased rapidly in non-clinical species with corresponding elimination half-lives ranging from 0.9 to 1.9 in rodents and from 2.1 to 3.4 hours.

The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  milnacipran  were  compared  across  gender  in  rats,  rabbits  and dogs. No  substantial differences were found. Repeat-dose administration does not result in accumulation.

Tissue  distribution  of  milnacipran  and/or  its  metabolites  was  assessed  after 14 C-milnacipran  single dose orally administered to mice, rats, monkeys and intravenously to rats.

After  administration  of 14 C-milnacipran,  tissue  distribution  was  rapid  and  large,  all  anatomical  and biological  structures  except  bones  being  radiolabelled.  Corresponding  highest  concentrations  were generally observed in the organs and tissues associated with absorption, metabolism and elimination (gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidneys, bile) and in various glands (testes, thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, thymus and adrenal). Cerebral tissues showed labelling in all nonclinical species.In monkeys, uptake of  radioactivity  into  the  eyes  suggested  that  milnacipran  and/or  metabolites  have  affinities  for melanin-rich structures (uveal tract, skin, eyes). It has been demonstrated that milnacipran can cross placental  barrier  in  animals.  Excretion  into  milk  was  observed.  In  all  species  the  binding  of milnacipran to plasma protein (albumin) was found to be low (15 - 26%).

Metabolic profile of milnacipran was assessed in plasma, urine and feces after oral administration of 14 C-milnacipran  to  mice,  rats,  monkeys  and  humans.  Additionally,  biotransformation  by  human hepatic microsomes and hepatozytes was investigated.

Generally, the results of in vitro metabolism of milnacipran were in good agreement with the results obtained  in  vivo.  Both  in  human  and  non-clinical  species  the  three  major  metabolites  were  two glucuronides (d-and l-milnacipran carbamoyl O-glucuronides) and N-desethyl milnacipran. Whereas the major circulating substance in all species was milnacipran, the plasma profile was different with respect to the metabolites: In human the predominant metabolites were the two glucuronides, whereas in  non-clinical  species  the  phase  I  metabolite  N-desethyl  milnacipran  was  dominating.  These  data reflect the fact that from a metabolic point of view non-clinical species and men differ to some extent. Among the rodents, rats are the most suitable species for toxicological studies of milnacipran.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Milnacipran biotransformation by human hepatic microsomes and hepatocytes was limited, less than 14.8%  of  the  milnacipran  being  transformed  by  the  microsomes.  The  IC50  of  milnacipran  on  the activity  of  cytochrome  P450  isozymes  was  always  greater  than  84  µM,  indicating  it  is  likely  that therapeutic usage of milnacipran will not have inhibitory potential on the activity of these isozymes.

The  rate  and  routes  of  excretion  of  total  radioactivity  have  been  studied  following  single  oral administration  of 14 C-milnacipran hydrochloride in mice, rats,  monkeys and humans.. Radioactivity excretion was rapid, with 70% (monkeys) to 90% (mice and rats) of the administered dose recovered in the excreta within 24 hours after dosing. The route of excretion of total radioactivity was similar in all the studied non-clinical species with the radioactivity of the dose being predominantly excreted in urine.

After  oral  administration  of 14 C-milnacipran,  the  dose  was  predominantly  excreted  in  urine  as unchanged milnacipran both in mice, rats, monkeys and in human.

Taken together, appropriate exposure of milnacipran and its metabolites in the safety evaluation has been  demonstrated  in  the  species  studied.  Absorption,  metabolism,  distribution  and  excretion  of milnacipran  have  been  adequately  described  in  the  studies.  Contrary  to  the  situation  found  in  nonclinical species hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system does not contribute much to the metabolism of milnacipran  in  humans,  which  suggests  low  potential  for  drug-drug  interactions  under  clinical conditions.

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

The oral single-dose toxicity of milnacipran or its enantiomers seemed to be similar in mice and rats with approximate lethal doses of 140 to 215 mg/kg.

- Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Pivotal  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  rats  and  monkeys  with  oral  application  of milnacipran  racemate.  Milnacipran  racemate  was  also  studied  after  repeated  dietary  application  to mice. The single enantiomers of milnacipran, F2695 and F2696, were investigated in separate repeatdose studies in rats only. Toxic effects of milnacipran on the liver were observed in all animal species, predominantly in males. In one repeat-dose study in male rats, reversibility of liver effects was shown. However,  concerning  female  rats  and  other  animal  species  investigated  a  definite  conclusion  on reversibility  of  liver  findings  cannot  be  drawn.  Decreases  in  male  reproductive  organ  weights  were seen in two long-term studies in rats. Decreases in male reproductive organ weights were also noticed in  a  fertility  study  in  rats.  Irreversible  histopathological  changes  of  the  spinal  cord  and  male reproductive  organs  were  observed  in  one  study  in  the  monkey.  However,  these  findings  were  not reproduced  in  other  repeat-dose  studies  in  monkeys.  Comparative  toxicity  studies  on  the  single milnacipran enantiomers and the racemate in the rat revealed qualitatively no major differences in the toxicity profile of both enantiomers. Beside the liver, the ovaries were noted as target organs of F2695 and  F2696  toxicity.  However,  quantitatively,  F2696  seemed  to  be  less  toxic  than  milnacipran  or F2695.

- Genotoxicity

Milnacipran  was  tested  in  a  standard  battery  of  genotoxicity  test,  revealing  no  evidence  for  any relevant genotoxic potential of milnacipran.

- Carcinogenicity

Life time carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat showed slight increases in relative liver weights and centrilobular  hypertrophy  and  vacuolation  but  no  increasing  tumor  incidence  compared  to  control groups. In a second mouse study in transgenic Tg.rasH2 mice performed to achieve higher exposure levels than in the 2 years study a slight increase in haemiangiosarcomas in different tissues compared to controls was observed in females only. This effect was considered to be accidental as the control

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

group  was  unusually  negative  for  this  common  type  of  tumor  in  this  species  when  compared  with historical controls. Calculations of safety margins based on plasma exposure levels were only done in the  transgenic  mouse  study  (resulting  in  safety  margins  of  6  for  males  and  9  for  females)  but  no comparative data were provided for the conventional life time studies. Pierre Fabre justified this with quality  of  exposure  data  from  life  time  studies  not  deemed  sufficient  for  quantitative  analyses. Measurements were only done to ensure absorption of the drug. However the exposure data from life time studies  nevertheless  gave  sufficient  evidence  that  exposure  of  rodents  in  these  studies  was  far below human therapeutic exposure levels.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

Reproductive and developmental toxicity of milnacipran were evaluated in two fertility studies in rats, embryotoxicity  studies  in  mice  and  rabbits  and  two  studies  on  pre/postnatal  development  in  rats. Toxicokinetic  parameters  were  obtained  for  pregnant  mice  and  rabbits.  Otherwise  exposure  margin calculations  are  made  difficult  by  missing  toxicokinetic  data.  General  toxic  effects  of  milnacipran became  evident  by  decreases  in  body  weight  gain,  in  food  consumption  and  by  salivation.  In  the fertility studies a lower fertility index was observed for high dose groups. Decreases in epididymides and ovary weights were observed in treated F0 animals. Similar findings were  made in repeat-dose studies  in  rats.  Furthermore,  effects  on  corpora  lutea  counts  and  histopathological  changes  in  male reproductive organs were observed in repeat-dose studies and/or reproductive toxicity studies in rats or monkeys. In embryotoxicity studies, no effects of milnacipran treatment were seen on fetal viability or development,  and  examinations  revealed  no  external,  visceral,  or  skeletal  anomalies  attributable  to milnacipran in mice and rabbits. Fetal weights were decreased after milnacipran treatment in mice, which was considered to be incidental by the applicant. A safety margin of 2 for the rabbit and of 7 for the mice towards human therapeutic exposure was calculated for the embryotoxicity studies. In pre/postnatal development studies, a NOAEL for maternal reproductive performance and for the offspring was  established  at  2.5  mg/kg/day,  which  is  probably  below  human  therapeutic  exposures  (proper toxicokinetic data are missing). At higher milnacipran doses, offspring toxicity was evidenced mainly by  a  reduced  number  of  offspring,  decreased  pup  survival,  decreases  in  pup  weight,  delays  in  pup development and impaired fertility of F1 females. The results of the pre-/postnatal development studies did not yield a clear indication as to whether reduced pup viability was directly due to treatment or was just secondary to impaired maternal care during lactation.

Juvenile toxicity studies have not been performed. The use of milnacipran in children is therefore not supported by any juvenile toxicity studies.

## · Toxicokinetic data

Toxicokinetic  data  for  milnacipran  racemate  are  available  for  all  animal  species  investigated. Toxicokinetic studies differentiating between the single enantiomers have only been performed for the rat.  Milnacipran  did  not  accumulate  following  repeated  oral  administration  in  animal  species investigated. No clear gender effect was observed in nonclinical species, except for a higher plasma exposure in female rats compared to males. This may be a consequence of a lower biotransformation rate in females. The enantiomeric participation of F2695 and F2696 in the milnacipran pharmacokinetic pattern was found to be globally similar to the one observed with the racemate in the rat. Since no data on the single enantiomers are available for the other nonclinical species, a similar pharmacokinetic behaviour of the single enantiomers can only be assumed for these animal species, too. Unfortunately, no toxicokinetic data are available for lower dose groups where mostly NOAELs were established. Therefore, a calculation of exposure margins is hampered by missing toxicokinetic data.  In  most  of  the  repeat-dose  studies  no  safety  margins  to  human  exposures  are  obtained  and reversibility of toxic effects (liver and reproductive organ tract findings) has not clearly been shown.

## · Local tolerance

No studies on local tolerance were performed. This is acceptable.

- Other toxicity studies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In antigenicity study performed in guinea pig milnacipran did not demonstrate an allergenic potential. No immunotoxic  potential  of  milnacipran  was  identified  in  standard  toxicity  studies.  According  to ICH S8, the immunotxic potential of milnacipran has been adequately evaluated.

On the basis of LD50 values, the self-inducing effect of milnacipran was evaluated. After pre-treatment of  rats  with  milnacipran  similar  LD50  values  were  obtained  compared to rats without pre-treatment. Accordingly, in relation to LD50 values no potential for a self-inducing effect was found.

Acute  toxicity  testing  of  some  milnacipran  metabolites  and  a  repeat-dose  toxicity  test  for  the metabolite F2782 was performed. F1612 has been identified as a degradent of milnacipran in finished drug product at levels exceeding 0.2 %. To qualify the safety of F1612 at a maximum level of 0.3 % in finished drug product, additional studies for acute toxicity, repeat-dose toxicity and genetic toxicity of F1612 were conducted. The stomach and the female reproductive tract were identified as target organs of F1612 toxicity with a NOAEL of 15 mg/kg/day. A 73-fold margin of safety (based on body surface area) for a maximum daily dose of 1 mg F1612 in the milnacipran drug product at the MRHD was calculated. A complete standard battery of genotoxicity tests for F1612 was provided showing only a slight  not  convincingly  reproducible  increase  in  chromosome  aberrations  in  vitro  at  doses  near  or exceeding the 10 mM dose level. All other tests including the in vivo study with high plasma exposure levels were negative and therefore the in vitro effects are regarded as artificial due to the extremely high dose.

Rats were pre-treated with phenobarbital (liver enzyme activator), piperonyl butoxide (liver enzyme inhibitor) or diethyl maleate (glutathione depletion) and successively with a single dose of milnacipran. Liver toxicity was assessed by measuring liver enzymes and by necropsy observations. No evidence of hepatotoxicity was noticed under these test conditions. However, this study seems to be of minor relevance concerning the evaluation of hepatic toxicity of milnacipran.

Milnacipran  was  examined  for  its  phototoxic  potential  in  male  albino  guinea  pigs.  No  treatment related, severe phototoxic reaction were seen. No exposure data are provided.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The  applicant  provided  a  detailed  environmental  risk  assessment  on  the  medicinal  product.  The environmental risk assessment follows Phase I and Phase II of the 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, June 2006). The CHMP agrees with the applicant that there is no risk to the aquatic compartment (surface water and  groundwater)  due  to  Milnacipran  hydrochloride.  No  final  conclusion  on  the  risk  to  sediment organisms was possible.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## Introduction

## GCP

Statements have been submitted confirming that clinical studies were conducted in accordance with the Ethical guidelines and in compliance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP).

## Pharmacokinetics

- Absorption

Milnacipran hydrochloride (also coded F2207) is a racemate composed of d-milnacipran also coded F2695 and l-milnacipran also coded F2696. Achiral and enantiomeric selective studies have been used in across the different studies.

There  were  no  differences  in  the  pharmacokinetics  of  d-milnacipran  and  l-milnacipran  when administered alone or as racemate, indicating no interconversion between the two enantiomers.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After intravenous and oral administration of 50 mg milnacipran HCl, the absolute bioavailability of milnacipran was 85% - 90%. After single and repeated oral administration, milnacipran was rapidly absorbed and Tmax averaged 2 to 4 hours after dosing across studies. Tmax was independent of the dose.

## · Distribution

Satisfactory studies have been performed to assess the distribution of milnacipran in the blood and its binding properties to blood components and plasma proteins.

## · Elimination

Milnacipran is predominantly renally excreted, it is therefore anticipated that impaired renal function will have a significant effect on its pharmacokinetic parameters.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Milnacipran is a racemate. dmilnacipran has a longer terminal half-life than l -milncipran, 8 to 10 hours and 4 to 6 hours respectively. There were no differences in the pharmacokinetic properties of milnacipran when administered as sole enantiomers and as the racemate suggesting no interconversion between the enantiomers.

Linear pharmacokinetics is demonstrated in the dose range 25 mg to 300 mg.

## · Special populations

Terminal half-life and plasma exposure are similar in healthy subjects and those with mild and moderate hepatic impairment.  An increase of approximately 30% was seen in AUC0-∞ and a 55% increase in T1/2 was seen in patients with sever hepatic impairment.  Based on these results the applicant considers that no dosage adjustment is warranted in patients with hepatic impairment.

Severe renal impairment resulted in a 59% increase in Cmax, 199% increase in AUC and 122% increase in T1/2.

Moderate renal impairment resulted in a 26% increase in Cmax, 52% increase in AUC and 41% increase in T1/2.  A difference in results was seen between studies and in a second study (M045) a 21% increase in Cmax, 110% increase in AUC and 44% increase in T1/2 was observed.

After oral administration of milnacipran to elderly healthy subjects (aged &gt; 65 years), values for maximum concentration (Cmax), plasma exposure (AUC0-∞ ) and terminal half-life (T1/2) for milnacipran were higher compared with those in healthy young subjects.

In elderly subjects pharmacokinetic parameters of both d-milnacipran and l-milnacipran after multiple dosing were similarly affected with a 31% and 38% increase in Cmax and a 27% and 39% increase in AUC0-∞ . The differences were attributed to the reduced renal function of elderly subjects. No agerelated dose adjustments are considered necessary unless renal function is reduced to values for which dose adjustment is recommended.

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

Concomitant  use  of  milnacipran  with  drugs  that  affect  serotonin  reuptake  should  be  maintained contraindicated  in  milnacipran  SPC  for  FMS  patients  since  interaction  has  not  been  systematically studied. Since serotonin syndrome has been reported in the postmarkering experience in MDD usage of milnacipran with other serotinergic agents such as MAOIs, SSRIs, Tramadol and St-John´s Wort and  triptans  is  contraindicated.  Milnacipran  should  further  be  contraindicated  when  used  with adrenaline and noradrenaline and with clonidine and related compounds.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Special  warning  (caution)  when  used  with  products  leading  to  hyponatremia  and  bleeding  like: NSAIDs, aspirin and other anti-coagulant agents, and diuretics or other treatments known to induce hyponatremia are implemented in SPC.

## Pharmacodynamics

Pharmacodynamic studies in human volunteers were coherent with the putative mechanism of action and the pharmacological profile of milnacipran demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo in animal studies. In general, and in comparison with TCAs, such as amitriptyline, milnacipran has a low pharmacodynamic  impact.  All of the observed effects are compatible with its  only  known pharmacological actions, namely the inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline in the brain  and  in  the  periphery  and  the  subsequent  stimulation  of  serotonergic  and  noradrenergic neurotransmission. The Applicant has addressed the potential for pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products and has provided details of drugs/classes that could or could not interact with the proposed product. The Applicant has provided the principal clases of drugs that could interact with milnacipran.

Concomitant  use  of  milnacipran  with  drugs  that  affect  serotonin  reuptake  should  be  maintained contraindicated  in  milnacipran  SPC  for  FMS  patients  since  interaction  has  not  been  systematically studied. Since serotonin syndrome has been reported in the postmarkering experience in MDD usage of milnacipran with other serotinergic agents such as MAOIs, SSRIs, Tramadol and St-John´s Wort and  triptans  is  contraindicated.  Milnacipran  should  further  be  contraindicated  when  used  with adrenaline and noradrenaline and with clonidine and related compounds.

Special  warning  (caution)  when  used  with  products  leading  to  hyponatremia  and  bleeding  like: NSAIDs, aspirin and other anti-coagulant agents, and diuretics or other treatments known to induce hyponatremia are implemented in SPC.

The only PK/PD study that examined the effects of milnacipran 200 mg on pain perception in FMS patients showed only a modest effect in favour of milnacipran as compared to placebo. The 5.2 mm VAS  downward  shift  of  the  stimulus  response  curve  for  pressure  pain  assessment  is  neither statistically significant (p=011) nor clinically relevant.

## Clinical efficacy

The clinical phase II and III studies performed in the target indication are summarized in the following table:

| Study number   | Design/objective                                                                                                          | Treatment groups Daily dose (regimen)                                  | Patients in efficacy analysis   | Treatment duration             |

## Dose-response studies:

The doses used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of milnacipran were derived from the phase II study FMS021. Based on these results, milnacipran 100 mg/d (BID) and 200 mg/d (BID) were investigated in the phase III studies in the claimed indication. No real dose finding studies have been performed as the previously examined doses for depressive disorder were used in these studies. This was considered adequate.

## Main clinical studies:

## Treatments and study design

All studies were double-blind, randomised, parallel group studies. The phase II study and the phase III pivotal  studies  were  placebo-controlled  while  the  phase  III  extension  studies  were  not  placebocontrolled.

Phase II  study  and  the  3  pivotal  phase  III  studies:  after  a  washout  period  which  varied  in  duration depending on the previously used drugs, a 2-week baseline period followed, during which pain and further characteristics of FMS were assessed. Patients then entered a dose escalation phase, followed by a fixed-dose phase. Regarding study GE 3 02, the fixed dose phase was followed by a 9-day downtitration phase, followed by a 2-week follow-up phase without treatment.

## Objectives

The primary objective of the pivotal studies was to evaluate the efficacy of milnacipran administered at doses of 200 mg/day (BID) and also of 100 mg/day (BID) in the US studies, compared to placebo for  the  whole  complex  of  the  fibromyalgia  syndrome,  including  pain,  physical  and  emotional outcomes.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoints: All studies comprised pain reduction using a self-reported 0-100 unit VAS scale as primary efficacy endpoint, accompanied by the Patient Global Impression of change (PGIC) and in the US studies (studies FMS031 and MLN-MD-02) by the Physical Component Summary (SF-36-PCS) as co-primary  endpoints.  The  original  protocol  for  study  FMS031  used  the  Fibromyalgia  Impact Questionaire (FIQ-PF) as functional endpoint; in the European study GE 302, the FIQ total score was used as a secondary endpoint, following scientific advice from the EMEA.

Besides pain FMS is characterized by additional severe physical and emotional function impairment. Therefore, the FIQ total score as the only adequately validated instrument in FMS is regarded as the most relevant secondary endpoint.

The definition of response was based on responder analyses incorporating pain, patient global status and  physical  function  into  a  composite  assessment.  Responder  Analyses  were  conducted  as  below described, as well as on all three domains:

Study GE 302: The primary efficacy assessment was a composite responder rate based on analysis of two  assessments:  pain  ( ≥ 30%  reduction  in  pain  from  baseline  in  the  24-hour  recall  pain  score recorded in the daily morning report) and PGIC (rating of 1 'very much improved' or 2 'improved'). FIQ total was considered to be a key secondary criterion and was included in the primary efficacy analysis.

Study FMS031: The primary efficacy assessments were composite responder rates. The responder rate for pain of fibromyalgia was based on the assessment of pain ( ≥ 30% reduction in pain from baseline in the 24-hour recall pain score recorded in the daily morning report) and PGIC at the 3-month and 6month Landmark Visits. The responder rate for FMS also  included assessment of physical function ( ≥ 30% improvement from baseline in FIQ-PF subscale score).

Study  MLN-MD-02:  The  primary  efficacy  assessments  were  composite  responder  rates.  The responder rate for pain of fibromyalgia was based on the assessment of pain ( ≥ 30% reduction in pain from baseline in the 24-hour recall pain score recorded in the daily morning report) and PGIC (rating of 1 'very much improved' or 2 'improved'). The responder rate for FMS also included assessment of physical function using SF-36-PCS (improvement from baseline of at least 6 points).

Criteria  for  Evaluation  (Study  GE  302):  Regarding  the  primary  analysis  of  efficacy,  patients  were classified as responders for the composite primary criterion if they reached the Week 4 visit (end of Dose Escalation)  and  satisfied  the  following  criteria  at  Week  16  or  premature  withdrawal  (PW): ≥ 30% reduction from baseline in the PED 24-hour recall pain VAS score during the endpoint period, no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

forbidden medications having a potential significant impact on FMS taken for possible FMS reasons during the 2 weeks prior to and including V 8/PW, at least seven available 24-hour recall pain VAS score data during the endpoint period, PGIC rated as 'very much improved' or 'much improved' (i.e., scored 1 or 2 on the 7 point scale) at the Week 16 visit or PW visit.

The  End-of-Fixed-Dose  Period  was  defined:  For  patients  withdrawn  after  V5:  as  the  14  days immediately prior to and including V8/PW, limited to seven days before V5. If there were less than seven available daily data, this period was backward extended until seven daily data were available (limited to seven days before V5). If, after the backward extension, there were still less than seven daily data, the pain value was set to missing. For patients withdrawn before or at V5: as the seven days immediately prior and including V8/PW, limited to the day after V3. If there were less than seven daily data, this period was backward extended until seven daily data were available (limited to the day after V3). If, after the backward extension, there were still less than seven daily data, the pain value was considered missing.

In the pivotal studies, patients were classified as responders if they reached a predefined week-visit and satisfied further predefined criteria. However, exclusion of patients who did not reach that point of time  resulted  in  a  selected  study  population  and  could  have  influenced  results  of  the  studies. Therefore, the applicant was asked to provide supplementary responder analyses for all main trials in which all patients who discontinued prematurely were regarded as non-responders.

Several methodical inconsistencies between the 3 pivotal studies were seen. For example, the studies differed  in  their  mean  duration  of  fibromyalgia  symptoms  (if  they had  been  evaluated)  and  in  their predefined included BDI baseline scores, resulting in a more depressed study population in the US studies compared to the European population.

In  the  US  studies,  patients  who  had  exacerbations  of  fibromyalgia  pain  severe  enough  to  require additional analgesic therapy were allowed to use hydrocodone. In the EU study GE 302, short-acting benzodiazepines (e.g. alprazolam and bromazepam) were allowed in cases of severe exacerbation of anxiety.

With regard  to  the  primary  assessment,  study  FMS031  initially  failed  to  demonstrate  a  statistically significant  effect  for  the  claim  of  treatment  of  pain  in  fibromyalgia  and  treatment  of  fibromyalgia syndrome for either dose. Borderline statistical significance was seen for a post hoc analysis suggested by the FDA for 200 mg/day of milnacipran for an effect on pain at 3 months (p = 0.032) and on the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome (p = 0.017). The decision to change the definition of improvement in the physical function from FIQ-PF to SF-36-PCS was a post-hoc decision that the applicant made after  the  study  was  unblended,  after  consultation  with  the  FDA.  In  this  case  the  results  should  be evaluated using both definitions of improvement in physical function. Numerous secondary endpoints were also evaluated in this study. There were no significant differences between active treatment and placebo for most of the secondary endpoints with the exception of the MASQ total score and the BDI at three month landmark for patients who received 200 mg milnacipran per day.

The  revised  analysis  exhibited  3  changes  to  the  predefined  analysis.  The  revised  analysis  carried forward  baseline  values  (BOCF)  for  any  missing  value  in  the  first  3  months  and  using  Last Observation  Carried  Forward  (LOCF)  for  any  missing  value  between  3-6  months.  It  also  used  a revised  definition  of  a  responder  for  the  PGIC  score  (responder  if  a  patient  has  a  score  of  1  or  2). Finally, the revised analysis uses the SF-36-PCS to define physical function instead of FIQ-PF. The revised  analyses  as  suggested  by  the  FDA  for  handling  of  missing  data  and  the  definition  of  a responder  for  the  PGIC  endpoint  appear  sensible.  However,  since  the  primary  efficacy  results  lied either side of the 5% significance level it was obvious that this study did not provide robust evidence of  efficacy.  The  proposal  to  use  a  different  endpoint  to  measure  physical  function  is  more  of  a concern. In summary, this study was not considered supportive for the benefit of this product.

With regard to the primary analyses of the three pivotal studies (study FMS031: post hoc analysis), statistically  significant  improvement  was  shown  in  the  primary  composite  criterion  for  milnacipran 200 mg/day treatment and in part also for 100 mg/day treatment at 3-months landmark.

However,  regarding  the  primary  efficacy  endpoints  and  additional  responder  analyses  only  a  small effect  of  doubtful  relevance  was  shown,  which  on  the  other  hand  had  not  been  consistently demonstrated. For instance, responder rates for active treatment versus placebo differ between 7 and 12%, using LOCF and BOCF approaches. Sensitivity analyses handling missing data in various ways do not consistently confirm the robustness of primary analyses; particularly using the BOCF approach handling  of  PW  and  missing  data  in  responder  analyses,  although  this  was  the  preferred  approach, chosen in agreement with the FDA for study FMS031.

With respect to the PED 24 h-Recall Pain VAS in study GE 302, the only study in which a European population was included, and the mean difference in change from baseline was 4.63 on a 0-100 unit pain-scale for milnacipran 200 mg compared to placebo. Regarding the PGIC, a total of 21% of the patients  improved  'much'  or  'very  much'  in  the  placebo  group  and  34.6%  in  the  active-treatment group.  Most  of  the  milnacipran  treatment  patients  only  showed  'minimally'  improvement.  For  the FIQ total score, response to placebo treatment was substantial (mean change from baseline of 10.48

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

compared to mean change from baseline of 13.20 in the milnacipran group). The improvement for milnacipran relative to placebo represents a difference in decrease about 3 (LSMeans). The applicant was requested to discuss the clinical relevance. However the provided explanation, which was again considered  insufficient,  confirms  the  previous  Rapporteurs`  opinion  that  the  presented  results  only demonstrate an unconvincing clinical effect. The provided additional analyses failed to demonstrate robustness of the effects.

Most  analyses  of  the  secondary  efficacy  variables  demonstrate  a  trend  towards  a  better  effect. However,  there  is  a  lack  of  consistent  statistical  significance  and  clinical  relevance  of  the  mean differences.  The  total  FIQ,  considered  to  be  the  most  relevant  secondary  endpoint,  did  not  reach statistical  significance  in  one  pivotal  study  (study  FMS031),  neither  for  100  mg  nor  for  200  mg milnacipran.

Concerning efficacy, the recommended dose in the SPC is 100 mg daily. The applicant states, that some patients would benefit from a dose of 200 mg daily. However, up to now, the recommended dose (100 mg) was derived only from trials conducted in the US population (one study failed in it`s primary endpoint). Efficacy of the recommended 100 mg dose has not been demonstrated in an EU clinical setting; no data are available that allow for a conclusion whether the recommended dose might have an effect  in  the  target  population,  the  European  population,  as  it  is  still  uncertain,  whether  regional differences  in  medical  and  social  culture  influence  the  effect.  Study  GE  302  only  evaluated  the efficacy  of  MLN  200  against  placebo,  whereas  study  GE  304  was  a  long-term  uncontrolled  study, designed to assess long-term safety as primary objective; the secondary objective was to assess longterm efficacy.

No dose dependent increase of the therapeutic effect was shown for milnacipran in the higher dose (200 mg/d); consequently study-results for the lower treatment dose (100 mg/d) are of questionable relevance. The applicant was asked to discuss the proposed posology in the claimed indication with respect to the presented efficacy results.

No statistically significant and clinically relevant effect was shown for the male population.

In the FAS population of the three pivotal studies, there was a higher and dose dependent incidence of early  discontinuations  due  to  adverse  events  in  the  100  mg/d  (19.2%)  and  the  200  mg/day  (23.9%) milnacipran  treatment  groups  when  compared  to  placebo  (9.6%).  Discontinuation  due  to  lack  of efficacy was clearly higher in the US population when compared to the European population, which leads to difficulties in adopting results from one region to another. The fact that only one study (study GE 302) took place in Europe further questions the generalisability of the efficacy results.

## Maintenance of effect:

The 2 US phase III extension studies do not investigate whether long-term treatment is appropriate. For  patients  who  have  completed  3  months  treatment  with  200  mg/day  of  milnacipran  it  remains possible that a reduced dose of 100 mg/day or less would be equally effective. It also remains possible that long term treatment is not necessary at all. Discontinuation in the long-term extension studies, was high, which questions the evidence of long-term efficacy.

With the answer to the day 180 LoOI, the applicant provided Study GE 304, a long-term uncontrolled study, designed to assess the long-term safety of milnacipran in the treatment of FM over 12 months of exposure at the target doses of 100, 150 and 200 mg/day. Long-term efficacy (including the durability of efficacy) of these milnacipran doses in terms of pain relief, improvement in patients' global ratings of change and alleviation of the associated symptoms of FM was studied as a secondary objective. The study  was  performed  in  a  dose-blinded  manner.  The  number  of  withdrawn  patients  was  high, especially due to adverse events, therapeutic failure and patient`s decision. Overall, a modest effect of milnacipran in patients with fibromyalgia can be seen from the data presented. There was a tendency of  a  better  effect  at  endpoint  for  the  200  mg  dose.  However,  with  respect  to  the  lack  of  a  placebo control group, the clinical relevance of the estimated effects is not clearly comprehensible; analyses to assess statistical significance are missing. The Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) approach to deal with missing data has been used in these analyses.

Due to the fact that the primary objective was the evaluation of long-term safety and a placebo control is lacking, study GE 304 only has supportive value for the assessment of efficacy of milnacipran in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment of fibromyalgia. These data can be considered supportive for understanding maintenance of efficacy, but not confirmative as efficacy was only a secondary outcome variable. Long-term placebocontrolled data are furthermore needed.

## Subgroup analyses:

Subgroup analyses based on gender, age, BMI and BDI were performed with the pooled database. Although the patient numbers were limited for patients ≥ 65 and males ( ≤ 65) and the mean weight of patients in the EU study was approximately 10 kg less than in all treatment groups in the US studies, the effect of milnacipran seems to be similar in patients regardless of age and BMI.

## BDI

Patients were divided into 3 subgroups according to BDI score (0-9, 10-18 and ≥ 19). All three pivotal studies excluded patients if they were suffering from a current major depressive episode. Although all studies should exclude patients with a baseline BDI score &gt;25, the applicant admitted that there are differences in means at baseline for BDI score between US and Europe. For example, study MLNMD-02 included 40 patients with a BDI at baseline &gt; 25 in every treatment group.

From the presented data, it cannot be adequately concluded, that more depressive patients (baseline BDI  &gt;  25)  in  the  US  studies  do  not  limit  the  external  validity  of  the  studies.  Furthermore,  no conclusions can be drawn, whether an improvement of depressive mood state has influenced the direct analgetic effect. Study FMS031 and study MLN-MD-02 demonstrated statistically significant changes in the BDI score at 3-month landmark for milnacipran 200 mg, resulting from a modest antidepressive effect  of  milnacipran hydrochloride. Whether the treatment effect in fibromyalgia is independent of improvements in depressive symptoms has not been sufficiently answered. It rather seems that there is a link between drug effect and mood.

- Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Pooling  of  the  pivotal  study-results  is  considered  not  acceptable  due  to  several  inconsistencies between  the  studies,  which  were  not  adequately  answered  by  the  applicant  until  now.  Concerning baseline  disease  status,  no  conclusions  can  be  drawn  from  the  provided  data:  History  duration  of diagnosis was presented for study FMS-031 whereas history duration of symptoms was evaluated for study MLN-MD-02. However, it should be kept in mind, that despite a trend of efficacy one of the three studies failed in its primary analyses and there were no consistent effects in both, primary and secondary  endpoints.  The  pivotal  studies  showed  positive  results  but  not  consistently  supported  by results from relevant secondary endpoints. This aspect should be considered when assessing the value of the pooled analyses provided by the Applicant.

As  no  conclusions  can  be  drawn  about  the  mean  duration  of  fibromyalgia  symptoms  between  the pivotal  studies  and  more  depressive  patients  were  included  in  the  US  studies  in  comparison  to  the European study the generalisability of the effects remains questioned.

- Supportive study

## Supportive study: Study FMS-021

A phase II, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of Milnacipran compared two  dosing  regimens  of  milnacipran  (200  mg  QD  and  100  mg  BID)  with  placebo  in  patients  with FMS. The  primary  outcome  measure  in  this  trial  was  based  on  patients'  self-reported  pain  scores (anchored  visual  analog  scale  [VAS]  using  Gracely  units)  recorded  on  the  PED.  Statistically significant  results  were  only  received  for  the  weekly  recall  pain.  However,  the  difference  between mean changes from baseline for BID to QD of 0.6 on a 0-20 VAS scale is of questionable clinical relevance. Given the choice of dose regimen namely 200 mg milnacipran once a day versus 100 mg twice  a  day  the  study  contained  an  insufficient  number  of  test  dose  schedules  to  provide  sufficient evidence of a dose related effect. More patients discontinued in the QD group due to adverse events. Therefore, this study indicates, that taking milnacipran 200 mg/day (BID) is better tolerated.

Furthermore, the applicant presented an abbreviated study report of the recently completed US study MLN-MD-03, a Phase III US and Canadian pivotal, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled monotherapy study of milnacipran for the treatment of fibromyalgia. The primary objective

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of this study was to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of milnacipran in the treatment of FMS or the pain associated with fibromyalgia. The primary outcome measure was a composite responder status assessing response rates when patients were dosed with 100 mg/day (50 mg BID) of milnacipran as compared  to  placebo,  after  twelve  weeks  of  stable  dose  treatment.  However,  due  to  the  provided abbreviated  study  report,  no  definite  conclusion  can  be  drawn  with  respect  to  study  design  and efficacy results.

- Other studies submitted during the evaluation.

Two tudies, MLN-MD-03 and GE 3 04, were not completed for the initial submission in 2008. The final report for GE 304 was provided upon CHMP request with the 'Clinical written responses to the CHMP D180 List of Outstanding Issues'.

Study MLN-MD-03 was finalized at the end of the procedure. Only a short summary was submitted and assessed at Day 180 Assessment Report. The final report for MLN-MD-MD03 was attached to the reexamination submission.

Both studies are discussed in the re-examination section.

## Clinical safety

## · Patient exposure

The milnacipran safety data in FMS were classified into three different analysis sets based on study design and duration: Group A: Five princeps studies (FMS021, GE 2 04, FMS031, MLN-MD-02, and GE  3  02),  Group  B:  Two  extension  studies  (FMS034  and  MLN-MD-04)  and  Group  C:  Patients exposed to milnacipran for at least one year (this was a subgroup of group B). A total of 3445 patients have  been  included  in  clinical  studies  with  milnacipran.  Overall,  1144  patients  with  FMS  received placebo, 684 patients received milnacipran 100 mg/day, and 1819 patients received milnacipran 200 mg/day. The mean duration of exposure was 126.1 days for placebo, 145.3 days for milnacipran 100 mg/day, and 154.1 days for milnacipran 200 mg/day.

Extensive safety information on milnacipran in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) was also reviewed including clinical study data as well as spontaneous post-marketing experience data. 47 studies were conducted in 6803 adult patients and 2 studies in 150 young patients. A total of 4544 patients were treated with milnacipran alone. Post-marketing exposure in MDD is estimated to involve 18.5 million patient-months.

- Adverse events

The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  reactions  in  FMS  patients  trials  were  nausea,  headache, constipation, hyperhidrosis and hot flush, these were reported in more than 10% of patients. There is a relatively  high  rate  of  hyperhidrosis  reported  in  the  European  study  (23.1%)  versus  the  US  studies (8.0-9.2%). The analysis of concomitant treatment showed that US patients are more frequently treated by psycholeptics (42.1 % vs. 22.9%), antihistaminics (31.9 % vs. 8.8 %) and hormone therapy (33.61 % vs. 20.12 %) than the EU patients (numbers for MLN 200 mg). This could be one explanation for the difference in reporting hyperhidrosis in Europe versus US.  The hypothesis that the US population could  be  less  bothered  by  this  symptom  than  the  EU  patients  might  be  another  explanation contributing  to  this  difference.  Both  explanations  however  suggest  that  US  and  EU  populations  are different as far as concomitant treatment and perception of symptoms are concerned which might lead to differences in the perception of the disease as well.

The overall  safety  profile  does  not  appear  very  different  for  fibromyalgia  patients  than  for  patients treated with milnacipran for MDD except for psychiatric and somatic events in the non-FM group, and musculoskeletal events in the FM group, as expected from the difference in indications and underlying pathologies.

The percentage of patients who discontinued prematurely ranged from 15.4% in the placebo group in the EU study, to 40.0% in the US milnacipran 200 mg/day group. In all treatment groups, AEs were the most common reason for premature discontinuation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The fibromyalgia patients tended to have higher frequencies of adverse events than non FMS patients, following both milnacipran and placebo administration, suggesting a population-specific rather than drug-specific phenomenon In spite of the low numbers in male (only 4.3 % of study population) and older patients (&lt;6%), there does not appear to be a signal of an increased risk in these two subgroups of patients different from the current known safety profile registered during FM clinical studies and in non FM studies.

No clear relationship between the dose and the incidence of TEAEs and SAEs was observed.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

Three deaths were reported in the fibromyalgia studies and were considered by the investigator as not treatment related.

## · Laboratory findings

Milnacipran has not shown evidence of clinically important hepatotoxicity in clinical studies. Reports of  hepatitis  in  the  post-marketing  experience  have been uncommon and of uncertain relationship to milnacipran,  and  any  European  and  Japanese  regulatory  concerns  have  been  addressed  with  mild precautionary labelling statements. While milnacipran has caused mild elevations of aminotransferases in  some  patients  participating  in  clinical  studies,  these  elevations  have  not  been  associated  with concomitant elevations of bilirubin.

The number of patients with ALAT elevation in non FMS was 0.2% for placebo, 0.4% for milnacipran 100 mg and 0.1% for milnacipran 200 mg . The increases in FMS patients were substantially higher (1.6% placebo, 2.3% milnacipran 100 mg and 4.2% milnacipran 200 mg) and dose dependent. There was a slight gender difference in both FM and non-FM patients, with males having a higher incidence of elevated ALAT and ASAT on both placebo and milnacipran. Females have lower incidences. This is not consistent with the scientific literature stating that females are predisposed more than males to develop transaminase increase.  The sample size of male FM patients was rather small so that the data are  difficult  to  interpret.  Nevertheless,  the  difference  is  small  and  the  majority  of  cases  had  only slightly elevated liver enzymes (&gt; 1 or &gt; 1.5 x ULN for ALAT and ASAT).

## · Safety in special populations

The  cardiovascular  effects  of  NA  and  5-HT  are  well-known  and  changes  in  HR  and  BP  during treatment with milnacipran are not unexpected. Cardiovascular effects of milnacipran include a slight to moderate increase in both SBP and DPP, a moderate increase in heart rate in non-hypertensive and in  patients  with  controlled  and  uncontrolled  hypertension.  Patients  with  a  history  of  cardiovascular disorder or concomitant cardiac medication might have a higher incidence of cardiovascular adverse events (e.g. hypertension, hypotension, postural hypotension, tachycardia and palpitations). Consequently, it is recommended  to  increase the clinical monitoring in FMS  patients with hypertension or cardiac disease.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

Discontinuations  due  to  AEs  was  significantly  more  frequent  in  the  milnacipran  patient  groups (24.6%) compared with the placebo group (11.2%, p&lt;0.001). The proposed up-titration scheme in the SmPC, with low initial dose (25 mg QD), slow dose escalation (increased by 50 mg increments of 1 week each) with possibility of stepping down to the previous dose, or step prolongation, and the use of rescue and/or corrective treatment, is considered the best scheme to limit patient's discontinuation and supported by  data  from  study  302.  After  up-titration,  the  dose  will  be  accommodated  between  100 mg/day  and  200  mg/day,  with  a  150  mg/day  step,  according  to  individual  data  on  efficacy/safety profile as is the case for the management of all chronic diseases.

The incidence of nausea leading to discontinuation was dose dependent. A dose relationship was also observed for headache, hyperhidrosis, insomnia, heart rate increased, vomiting, constipation,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

abdominal pain leading to discontinuation. No clear relationship however was seen in the extension studies.

The Applicant has provided data for the evaluation of QT interval prolongation from two sources:

- The first is the full report of study MLN-PK-10, a thorough QT study sponsored by Forest Research Institute (NJ, USA) in 2005.
- The  second  is  the  'Report  for  Additional  Pooled  Analysis  of  Safety  -  Regression-based calculation of the corrected QT interval'

The  uncorrected  QT  interval  was  increased  in  patients  who  received  milnacipran.    Depending  on whether Bazett's or Fredica's correction is applied the number of patients in whom QT prolongation is observed  changes.  In  the  pooled  analysis  four  of  the  fibromyalgia  studies  were  available  for  the analysis of the QT interval based on regression method.

Regardless of the correction used there were more potentially clinically significant prolongations in QT interval (&gt;=60ms) observed in patient who received milnacipran compared to placebo.

Half  of  the  cases  of  cardiac  arrhythmias  were  excluded  on  the  bases  that  adverse  events  such  as irregular heart rate, unspecified arrhythmia, or unspecified extrasystoles could not be characterized as supraventricular  or  ventricular  arrhythmia  due  to  lack  of  diagnosis  by  the  investigator  and  were considered as unspecified.  The remaining cardiac arrhythmias were four cases of QTc prolongation in the milnacipran and 32 coded as arrhythmia in 28 patients.

In  milnacipran  3  out  of  4  cases  of  QT/QTc  interval  prolongation  were  considered  as  serious  (atrial fibrillation  /  atrial  flutter,  premature  ventricular  contraction  /  atypical  chest  pain  /  palpitations,  and syncopal  episode  /  irregular  heart  beat)  and  required  hospitalization,  compared  to  1  in  the  placebo group. The events led to milnacipran discontinuation in ten patients (including the 3 serious adverse events).  For  the  QTc  prolongation  the  Applicant  stated  that  they  were  moderate  and  possible confounding factors were observed.

These confounding factors were also proposed as the cause of arrhythmia and these are the presence of cardiovascular diseases such  as mitral valve prolaps, previous atrial fibrillation,  hypertensive cardiopathy,  supraventricular  arrhythmia,  cardiac  ablation  and  ventricular  extrasystoles.  Apart  from that there were 13 patients concomitantly treated with medications which could induce arrhythmia or tachycardia such as anti asthma agents (salmeterol, salbutamol), antihistamine agents (desloratadine, loratadine,  fexofenadine),  lisinopril,  levothyroxine,  cyclobenzaprine,  pseudoephedrine,  ketoconazole and tramadol.

In  addition  to  the  above  arrhythmia  cases  there  were  nine  cases  of  syncope,  presyncope  or  loss  of consciousness,  4  cases  were  considered  as  serious  (feeling  syncopal  /  intermittent  chest  pain  / intermittent  rapid  heart  beat,  acute  transient  ischemic  attack,  near  syncope,  and  presyncope  / hypertension) and 3 of these led to milnacipran discontinuation. In the placebo group, 2 non-serious syncopes in two patients were reported.

In conclusion:

- Milnacipran works through the modulation of noradrenergic neurotransmission and therefore can result in changes in blood pressure and heart rate and predispose to cardiovascular adverse effects.
- High incidence of raised systolic and diastolic BP and high incidence of raised heart rate are well documented with milnacipran.
- If  the  reported cases of arrhythmias/QTc are stated as caused by (half of the arrhythmias as suggested by the Applicant) the confounding factors then for this reason a warning is needed.

This is supported by an US epidemiological study that evaluated patient profile, treatment patterns, and cardiovascular disease risk for patients with fibromyalgia syndrome in the United States presented by the applicant in the day 180 response to LoQ. The reported data provide some evidence that fibromyalgia is independently associated with an increased risk of CVD events. Underlying hypertension and fibromyalgia treatment seemed to increase this risk.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Therefore a contraindication in patients with severe cardiac function impairment or with an identified very high risk of a serious cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. those with a significant left ventricular dysfunction, NYHA  Class  III/IV),  uncontrolled  hypertension,  severe  or  unstable  coronary  heart  disease  was implemented as these underlying conditions may be worsened by increases in blood pressure or heart rate. Furthermore these should be part of the risk management plan.

The  urinary  adverse  reactions  (eg  dysuria)  mainly  occurred  in  male  patients.  Therefore,  the  use  of milnacipran in patients with urinary problems (eg prostatic hypertrophy) should be initiated with close monitoring  of  urinary  symptoms.  However  it  would  appear  that  male  patients  with  normal  urinary flow are equally at risk to urinary symptoms.

In the Day 180 response to LoQ document the applicant provided new safety data from the following studies: Study MLN-MD-O3: A Phase III US and Canadian Pivotal, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled monotherapy study of milnacipran for the treatment of fibromyalgia and

Study F02207 GE 3 04: A European Phase III, multicenter, double-blind, randomised, monotherapy, 12 month study of milnacipran for the treatment of the fibromyalgia syndrome.

As far as assessment of data in abbreviated report of Study MLN-MD-O3 was possible, the adverse event profile in this 12-week study did not differ from previously reported short term data. No urinary adverse reactions were reported in this study. No unexpected safety aspects were discovered. The safety profile seen in the long-term European study F02207 GE 3 04 was satisfactory and no unexpected adverse reactions and/or safety findings were observed with long term administration of milnacipran for the treatment of FM. The data did not support a long-term dose-dependence for adverse events.

The drop out rate however, is considered to be high (39.5%). 28.6 % of patients experienced AEs which led to discontinuation.

Overall, the size of the safety database was considered adequate and the exposure to milnacipran in FMS studies had been adequately summarized by the applicant. Given the pharmacological properties of milnacipran there is nothing unexpected in the AE profile.

However, this has to be viewed in light of the overall benefit/risk profile, which was considered to be negative. The CHMP considered that, given the modest clinical effect size observed, the significantly higher  discontinuations  due  to  adverse  events  in  the  milnacipran  patients  group  weighed  against  a positive risk/benefit balance.

## Pharmacovigilance System

The  Applicant  has  provided  documents  that  set  out  a  detailed  description  of  the  system  of pharmacovigilance  (Version  8  dated  May  2009).  A  statement  signed  by  the  Applicant  and  the qualified person for pharmacovigilance, indicating that the Applicant has the services of a qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance and the necessary means for the notification of any adverse reaction occurring either in the Community or in a third country has been provided.

The Applicant has committed to submitting together with the first PSUR a revised DDPS answering the former questions 15-17 and adhering to the structure specified in Volume 9A. Provided that the commitment is fulfilled as stated, the  CHMP may consider that the Pharmacovigilance system will fulfil the requirements. The Applicant must ensure that the system of Pharmacovigilance is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market.

## 2.5. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted an appropriate risk management plan.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application is of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation activities were not able to reduce the risks to an acceptable level.

## 2.6. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

Information on development, manufacture, and control of the active substance milnacipran hydrochloride and the medicinal product Impulsor 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg hard capsules have been presented in a satisfactory manner. Results carried out indicated adequate manufacture, and stability of the medicinal product.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Acute oral toxicity testing has demonstrated that milnacipran is moderately toxic.  LD50 values were 240 mg/kg, p.o., and 36 mg/kg, i.v., in mice and 228 mg/kg, p.o., and 51.2 mg/kg, i.v., in rats. Major clinical signs included convulsions, hypoactivity and prostration.

In subchronic studies, the major organ affected was the liver.  Slight to moderate increases in liver weights and/or centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy were observed.  These changes did not involve adverse biochemical or major histologic modifications.  At doses greater than the NOAEL, mainly hepatocyte hypertrophy with vacuolation was observed, predominately in the centrilobular area, sometimes with a slight lipidic accumulation, but without significant effects on hepatic enzymes.

Milnacipran did not demonstrate carcinogenic, genotoxic, embryotoxic, teratogenic, phototoxic, or immunotoxic potential in preclinical studies.

Toxicokinetic studies demonstrate that milnacipran is readily absorbed and does not show major accumulation.

## Efficacy

The  efficacy  of  milnacipran  in  fibromyalgia  syndrome  (FMS)  has  been  evaluated  in  eight  clinical efficacy studies: 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II study, 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III pivotal studies and 3 double-blind, Phase III long-term extension studies.

The primary objective of the pivotal studies was to evaluate the efficacy of milnacipran administered at doses of 200 mg/day (BID) and (also of 100 mg/day (BID) in the US studies), compared to placebo for  the  whole  complex  of  the  fibromyalgia  syndrome,  including  pain,  physical  and  emotional outcomes.

With regard to the primary analyses of the three pivotal studies (study FMS031: post hoc analyses), statistically significant improvement  could  be  shown  in  the primary  composite criterion for milnacipran  200  mg/day  treatment  and  in  parts  also  for  100  mg/day  treatment  after  3-months landmark.  However,  regarding  the  primary  efficacy  endpoints  and  further  responder  analyses  the clinical  effect  was  modest,  inconsistent  and  of doubtful relevance. Study FMS031 initially failed to demonstrate  a  statistically  significant  effect  for  the  claim  of  treatment  of  pain  in  fibromyalgia  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome for either dose. Although statistical significance was seen for a post hoc analysis suggested by the FDA after development of 3 changes to the predefined analysis, this  study  does  not  provide  robust  evidence  of  efficacy.  Sensitivity  analyses  did  not  consistently confirm  the  robustness  of  improvements.  Additional  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoints  as  well  as analyses  of  further  secondary  efficacy  variables  demonstrated  a  trend  towards  a  better  effect  for treatment with milnacipran, without stringent consistency with the primary outcome parameters.

The presented analyses and further explanations given by the applicant are not considered acceptable to  demonstrate  a  consistent  and  clinically  relevant  benefit  for  patients  in  pain  and  functional improvement. This related to milnacipran-treatment in doses of 100 mg/day but especially for doses of 200 mg/day. As there was no convincing effect with the higher dose (200 mg/d), study-results for the lower treatment dose (100 mg/d) are of questionable relevance. The studies submitted do not provide the answer to whether once or twice daily dosing is the best approach. Hence the dose response has not been fully defined and the optimal dose has not been established.

Provided  additional  analyses,  stratified  for  male  and  female  patients  did  not  show  significant  and clinically relevant effects for the male population.

Only  one  study  to  show  short-term  efficacy  was  performed  in  the  European  population.  Several methodical inconsistencies between this study and the 2 pivotal US studies were given. No adequate explanation was given by the applicant to justify these indifferences sufficiently. On the basis of these discrepancies, the pooled data are considered to be doubtful to demonstrate efficacy. It should be kept in  mind  that  despite  a  trend  of  effect  one  of  the  three  studies  failed  in  it`s  primary  analyses.  This should be considered when assessing the value of the pooled analyses provided by the Applicant.

As the tested drug has antidepressant properties it should be clear that the effect size observed can not be  attributed  to  an  improved  mood.  Whether  the  treatment  effect  in  fibromyalgia  is  independent  of improvements in depressive symptoms cannot be assessed so far from the submitted data. However, it seems that there is a link between drug effect and mood.

Long-term efficacy of milnacipran has not convincingly been demonstrated in the US population. The discussion regarding maintenance of effect has been based on studies that were carried out exclusively in the US. The external validity of this, still questionable, evidence for the EU population is uncertain as  obviously  differences  in  attitudes  towards  fibromyalgia,  the  treatment  and  the  perception  of  the disease  and  perception  of  efficacy  exist.  This  makes  it  necessary  to  obtain  maintenance  of  efficacy from the EU population.

With the answer to the day 180 LoOI, the applicant provided Study GE 304, a long-term uncontrolled study, designed to assess the long-term safety of milnacipran in the treatment of FM over 12 months of exposure at the target doses of 100, 150 and 200 mg/day. Long-term efficacy (including the durability of efficacy) of these milnacipran doses in terms of pain relief, improvement in patients' global ratings of change and alleviation of the associated symptoms of FM was studied as a secondary objective. The study  was  performed  in  a  dose-blinded  manner.  The  number  of  withdrawn  patients  was  high, especially due to adverse events, therapeutic failure and patient`s decision. Overall, a modest effect of milnacipran in patients with fibromyalgia can be seen from the data presented. There was a tendency of  a  better  effect  at  endpoint  for  the  200  mg  dose.  However,  with  respect  to  the  lack  of  a  placebo control group, the clinical relevance of the estimated effects is not clearly comprehensible. Due to the fact that the primary objective was the evaluation of long-term safety and a placebo control is lacking, study GE 304 only has supportive value for the assessment of efficacy of milnacipran in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Long-term data from the European population are still considered necessary.

## Safety

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Given the pharmacological properties of milnacipran as serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor there  is  nothing  unexpected  in  the  AE  profile.  Class  effects  include  blood  pressure  and  heart  rate

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

elevations,  potential  interactions  with  MAOIs,  serotonine  syndrome  and  elevation  of  aminotransferases.

The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  reactions  in  FMS  patients'  trials  were  nausea,  headache, constipation,  hyperhidrosis  and  hot  flush  and  the  typology  does  not  appear  very  different  in comparison to the adverse event profile in patients treated with milnacipran for MDD.

There  were  significantly  higher  discontinuations  due  to  adverse  events  in  the  milnacipran  patients group  versus  placebo  with  a  clear  dose  dependence  for  nausea,  headache,  hyperhidrosis,  insomnia, heart rate increased, vomiting, constipation and abdominal pain. The adverse event profile in the 12week study MLN-MD-O3 submitted as abbreviated report with the answer to the day 180 LoOI did not differ from previously reported short term data. No urinary adverse reactions were reported in this study.

The safety profile seen in the long-term European study F02207 GE 3 04 submitted with the answer to the day 180 LoOI was satisfactory and no unexpected adverse reactions and/or safety findings were observed with long term administration of milnacipran for the treatment of FM. The data did not support a long-term dose-dependence for adverse events.

The drop out rate however, is considered to be high (39.5%). 28.6 % of patients experienced AEs which led to discontinuation.

Milnacipran  works  through  the  modulation  of  noradrenergic  neurotransmission  and  therefore  can result in changes in blood pressure and heart rate and predispose to cardiovascular adverse effects. High  incidence  of  raised  systolic  and  diastolic  BP  and  high  incidence  of  raised  heart  rate  are  well documented with milnacipran.

There is some evidence that fibromyalgia is independently associated with an increased risk of CVD events. Underlying hypertension and fibromyalgia treatment increase this risk.

Therefore a contraindication in patients with severe cardiac function impairment or with an identified very high risk of a serious cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. those with a significant left ventricular dysfunction, NYHA  Class  III/IV),  uncontrolled  hypertension,  severe  or  unstable  coronary  heart  disease  was implemented as these underlying conditions may be worsened by increases in blood pressure or heart rate. Furthermore these should be part of the risk management plan.

A package leaflet user testing report conducted by LNA Ltd, London EC1V 4PY, UK and dated December 2008 has been provided. The provided PL is considered easy to read and appropriately usable for patients or caregivers.

## Risk-benefit assessment

A robust and clinical relevant effect in the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome in a patient population that corresponds to the EU setting has not convincingly been demonstrated, neither for 200 mg/day nor for 100 mg/day. It is not clear whether the effect size observed can be attributed to an improved mood state. It is questioned given the doubt on the clinical relevance of the effect size observed, whether the significantly higher discontinuations due to adverse events in the milnacipran patients group with a clear dose dependence for some adverse events justifies approval.

The benefit/risk balance of milnacipran in the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome remains negative. In light of the modest and inconsistent clinical effect the given safety profile is not acceptable.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Impulsor  in  the  treatment  of  fibromyalgia  syndrome  was unfavourable and therefore did not recommend the granting of the marketing authorisation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Grounds for refusal

1. There is a lack of robust evidence of efficacy in the short term, especially for the recommended dose of 100 mg/day. Furthermore the effect seen has not been convincingly shown to be clinically meaningful.
2. There is an insufficient demonstration of maintenance of effect in appropriately designed studies of relevance to the EU population.
3. The results from the US studies cannot be extrapolated to the EU population, taking into account the differences in procedures.
4. The safety profile, whilst well characterised, is not considered to be outweighed by the benefits, given the lack of robust evidence of efficacy.
5. Due to the aforementioned concerns, a satisfactory summary of product characteristics cannot be agreed at this stage.

## 3. RE-EXAMINATION OF THE CHMP OPINION of 23 July 2009

Following  the  CHMP  conclusion  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Impulsor  in  the  treatment  of fibromyalgia  syndrome  was  unfavourable,  the  applicant  submitted  detailed  grounds  for  the  reexamination of the grounds for refusal.

The CHMP asked the CNS -SAG (Scientific Advisory Group) to answer the following questions proposed by the re-examination Rapporteurs:

1. Are the statistically significant improvements of the primary and secondary endpoints seen in the presented clinical studies of a clinical relevance for the fibromyalgia patients?
2. Do the long-term data sufficiently demonstrate the long-term efficacy of milnacipran in the treatment of fibromyalgia?
3. Are there  substantial  differences  between  the  EU  and  US  population,  both  in  the  presented clinical studies and real-life situation, which would preclude extrapolating the results obtained in the US to the European population?
4. Could  the  treatment  effect  of  milnacipran  in  FMS  be  considered  independent  of  the improvement in mood?

The SAG meeting took place the 5 th of November 2009 and discussed the questions, providing their answer to CHMP.

During the CHMP meeting on 16 - 19 November 2009, the grounds for refusal were addressed by the applicant during an oral explanation before the CHMP.

The following assessment presents the arguments submitted by the applicant to address each ground for refusal, and the CHMP position on each of the grounds.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## CHMP ground for refusal 1:

'There is a lack of robust evidence of efficacy in the short term, especially for the recommended dose of 100 mg/day. Furthermore the effect seen has not been convincingly shown to be clinically meaningful.'

## Summary of Applicant's position:

## Argument 1: The clinical package provides adequate demonstration of efficacy in a large population relevant to the indication and the target European population

The clinical development programme performed with milnacipran is comprehensive and featured both mechanistic  studies  (pre-clinical  and  clinical)  and  a  complete  efficacy/safety  programme  including eight  clinical  studies  (1  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  phase  2  study,  4  double-blind,  placebocontrolled phase 3 pivotal studies and 3 double-blind, phase 3 long-term extension studies), in a total of  4110  FM  patients.  The  Applicant  therefore  argued  that  the  composition  and  the  size  of  this programme are sufficient to provide adequate demonstration of efficacy and safety.

The key features of the clinical efficacy/safety studies in FM are summarized below.

If dose limiting side effects were encountered during this phase the patient stepped down to the previous week's dose and maintained that lower dose for the remainder of the study.

b the pivotal efficacy evaluation was performed at 15-weeks following discussions with the FDA and a protocol amendment reducing study duration from 6 to 3 months.

- c studies GE 3 02 and GE 3 04 also had a 9-day down-titration phase after the fixed dose phase followed by a 2-week follow-up phase without treatment.
- d In the study MLN-MD-03, the fixed dose phase was followed by a two-week discontinuation phase where 50% of milnacipran-treated patients having completed the 12 weeks of stable dose medication were to be removed from active treatment and given placebo for the final two week of the study
- e MLN-MD-03 and GE 3 04 studies were not completed for the initial submission in June 2008. The final report for GE 304 was provided upon CHMP  request with the 'Clinical written responses to the CHMP D180' document. The final report for MLN-MD-MD03 was attached to the reexamination submission.
- f patients entering the study having previously received placebo or milnacipran 100 mg/day were randomised to receive either milnacipran 100 mg/day or 200 mg/day at a ratio of 1:4. Patients who had previously received 200 mg/day continued on this dose
- g patients continuing on the same dose as they received in the previous study underwent sham dose escalation.

h   patients entering the study having previously received placebo were randomised to receive either milnacipran 100 mg/day, 150 mg/day or 200 mg/day at a ratio of 1:1:1. Patients who had previously received 200 mg/day continued on this dose

In its initial assessment the CHMP stated that the 'presented results for study MLN-MD-03 cannot be properly evaluated due to the fact that only an abbreviated study report was provided'. This point was addressed  during  the  re-examination  by  the  transmission  of  the  full  and  final  study  report  for  this study.

## Study MLN-MD-03:

This study was finalized at the end of the procedure. A short summary was then submitted and assessed at Day 180 Assessment Report. The Applicant provided the final study report with the main body of re-examination documentation. The design of this US study was similar to those of all other pivotal phase 3 studies; inclusion criteria, and therefore, in the view of the Applicant, population baseline characteristics were very similar to those of the European pivotal phase 3 study.

The  study  MLN-MD-03  was  a  phase  3,  multicenter,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled, two-arm  parallel-group  study  to  investigate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  milnacipran  100 mg/day  in patients  with  FM.  After  a  washout  period  from  disallowed  medications,  patients  entered  a  2-week baseline period. Eligible patients were then randomised to treatment with milnacipran 100 mg/day (50 mg BID) or placebo (1:1). After a 4-6-week dose escalation phase, patients entered a 12-week stable dose  treatment  period,  which  was  followed  by  a  2-week  re-randomised  double-blind,  placebocontrolled discontinuation phase where 50% of milnacipran-treated patients were abruptly discontinued  from  milnacipran  therapy,  other  patients  continuing  their  initial  assigned  therapy. Patients  who  completed  the  study  had  therefore  a  total  of  16  to  20  weeks  of  treatment  exposure. Response to the same composite criterion defined for other pivotal phase 3 studies (requiring ≥ 30% reduction  in  pain  from  baseline  and  a  PGIC  rating  of  1  'very  much  improved'  or  2  'improved'), reflecting the overall effect of the product on FM was used in the primary analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As for other pivotal phase 3 studies, the MLN-MD-03 study was performed in outpatients with FM classified according to the 1990 ACR criteria, patients were aged 18-70 years, both male and females were eligible  for  inclusion,  moderate  to  severe  pain  was  required  at  baseline  and  patients  suffering from a current major depressive episode were excluded in order to avoid any confounding effect due to  a  potential  antidepressant  effect  of  the  product.  As  for  the  European  study,  the  assessment  of depressive disorders was performed at both screening and randomization using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the BDI (BDI ≤ 25 being required for inclusion) and patients with a minimum average baseline VAS pain score between 40 and 90 were eligible.

Similar results to those of other pivotal phase 3 studies were observed.

Out  of  1025  randomised  patients,  516  patients  received  milnacipran  100 mg/day  and  509  patients received placebo. The study was completed by 716 (69.9%) patients: 357 (69.2%) in the 100 mg/day milnacipran group and 359 (70.5%) in the placebo group. When applying similar inclusion and non inclusion  criteria,  baseline  characteristics  between  studies  are  very  similar,  as  evidenced  by  the comparison of the specific European GE 302 study.

At the end of the stable dose period, milnacipran showed a significantly greater improvement in the primary  composite  criterion  (pain  +  PGIC)  compared  with  placebo  (p&lt;0.001).  The  responder/nonresponder  ratio  for  patients  meeting  criteria  for  composite  response  was  significantly  greater  with milnacipran than placebo (odds ratio [OR] 1.9). These results were further supported by results from sensitivity analyses.

a Primary Analysis used the BOCF approach at Visit TX12 to impute missing postbaseline values (all patients who did not have an adequate observation for the evaluation of composite responder status at Visit TX12 were defined as nonresponders).

b Sensitivity Analysis 1 imputed data using the LOCF approach for all patients who lacked primary efficacy data at Visit TX12.

c Sensitivity Analysis 2 used the BOCF approach for patients who were noncompleters at Visit TX12, but used the LOCF approach for patients who completed Visit TX12 but who lacked primary efficacy data at this time point (Modified BOCF)

d Sensitivity Analysis 3 used observed cases only (ie, patients who completed Visit TX12 with an adequate observation for the evaluation of composite responder status).

e Sensitivity Analysis 4 used the GLMM approach for patients at Visit TX12 (The proportions are model based estimations and evaluated at median value of corresponding baseline value).

BOCF = baseline observation carried forward; GLMM = generalized linear mixed model; LOCF = last observation carried forward; MLN = milnacipran; OC = observed cases, CI = confidence interval; OR = odds ratio.

Secondary analyses found that milnacipran led to statistically significant improvements on multiple domains as compared to placebo (in particular on SF-36 (both component summary scores and all 8 domains of the SF-36), MFI, FIQ and MASQ). Randomised withdrawal data show the absence of any rebound phenomenon after treatment cessation.

In  conclusion,  according  to  the  Applicant,  the  MLN-MD-03  study  confirms,  on  all  relevant parameters, that milnacipran at the dose of 100 mg/d is an effective treatment for the multidimensional symptoms of FM. Similarity of design, inclusion criteria, baseline characteristics and results with the European GE 302 study justify the use of the US study results to support the present application.

## Standardized and validated efficacy assessment methods were used in all studies, providing consistent and comparable data

In all  studies,  the  clinical  outcomes assessed the different symptoms of FM, used validated patientreported-outcomes, and included the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), pain Visual Analog Scales (VAS) (recorded daily on a patient electronic diary in all phase 3 studies), the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), the Short Form-36 Health Survey Mental and Physical Component Summary (SF-36-MCS and SF-36-PCS), the Multiple Ability Self-report Questionnaire (MASQ) and the Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep Index (MOS-Sleep). The efficacy of milnacipran is therefore assessed in a very comprehensive and appropriate manner, using validated assessment tools in all studies.

## The efficacy of milnacipran is demonstrated statistically in three pivotal placebo controlled studies; this efficacy is clinically relevant

Four specific phase 3 pivotal placebo-controlled studies were performed. The results of the first phase 3  study  conducted  in  the  US  were  in  favour  of  the  efficacy  of  milnacipran,  but  reached  statistical significance only for post-hoc analyses performed in agreement with the FDA; this study is therefore considered by the CHMP as negative. However, in all three following pivotal studies, including the specific European study, the efficacy of milnacipran was demonstrated both from a statistical and from a clinical point of view.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  absence  of  contradictory  results,  and  the  remarkable  convergence  of  all  results  in  the  phase  3 studies  is  a  strong  argument  for  the  robustness  of  the  effects.  This  is  further  confirmed  by  the consistency  of  results  when  using  various  statistical  approaches  within  each  study  and  between studies.

The primary composite response criterion used in the clinical programme corresponds, by definition, to individually meaningful changes, with both a reduction in pain score of at least 30% and a PGIC rated as 'very much' or 'much improved'. Both components of this composite endpoint have been validated in various indications and do correspond, separately, to clinically meaningful improvements. The combination of both improvements to qualify a patient as responder represents therefore a very stringent  criterion.  Therefore  a  statistically  significant  difference  versus  placebo  is  based  on  a clinically relevant parameter. This criterion was defined a priori and validated by the CHMP in the 2005 Scientific Advice.

The results of the European phase 3 pivotal study show a responder rate of 24.2% on milnacipran, statistically higher than the 14.6% response rate observed on placebo (primary analysis); the chances to be responder to the primary criterion with milnacipran (odds ratio) are substantial compared with placebo: odds ratio estimates vary from 1.9 to 2.4 depending on the analyses; these results are coherent with those observed in the US studies.

Out of all statistical approaches, analyses in completers should be considered with attention, since they do reflect the effect of the product in conditions that mimic clinical practice, in patients who stay on treatment. In these analyses, the placebo-corrected response rate on milnacipran for the primary criterion reaches for the 100 mg dose 13.4% and 16.2% for studies MLN-MD-02 and MLNMD-03 respectively, and for the 200 mg dose 20.4% and 15.6% for studies MLN-MD-02 and GE 302 respectively.

When considering the overall effect observed with a product, one should obviously take into account the  placebo-corrected  effect  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  efficacy  brought  by  the  product  is  real  and consistent. This  effect  was  statistically  significant.  However,  an  additional  approach  may  be considered  in  order  to  quantify  the  effect  that  is  most  likely  to  be  observed  in  daily  practice,  by assessing  the  overall  drug  effect.  The  overall  effect  observed  in  patients  receiving  milnacipran  is comprised, depending on the studies, between 24% and 33% of responders to the primary criterion (LOCF  approach),  which  means  that,  in  daily  practice,  at  least  one  in  four  FM  patients  will  be significantly improved by the treatment.

Moreover, most analyses of the change from baseline in the intensity or the score of the secondary efficacy  criteria  demonstrate  a  favourable  effect  of  milnacipran,  especially  for  fatigue,  which  is acknowledged as a key secondary symptom in FM.

In  addition,  improvements  on  key  secondary  criteria  (FIQ,  stiffness,  fatigue,  restorative  sleep)  are highly correlated with response measured by the composite criterion, for example the minimum mean change in FIQ total score is 34 in milnacipran composite responders over studies.

Therefore, the response to the composite primary criterion in patients treated with milnacipran reflects a  major improvement of the syndrome, with a high overall satisfaction of patients (as measured by PGIC) and significant benefit on the different symptoms of the syndrome.

It is argued that the efficacy of milnacipran as demonstrated using the primary composite criterion is also  observed  on  criteria  that  are  very  relevant  to  the  disease,  excluding  any  artificial  finding.  The effects of milnacipran are therefore observed on various dimensions that both characterize the disease and are relevant targets for therapeutic intervention.

In  the  absence  of  any  product  approved  for  the  treatment  of  FM  and  of  any  guideline  setting  a minimally acceptable  effect  size,  it  is  argued  that  the  effect  demonstrated  with  milnacipran  is  real, clinically relevant, and represents an adequate response for a significant proportion of patients with no current therapeutic alternative.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## The dose regimen recommended in the SmPC is in line with the composition of the dossier and the key efficacy results

The clinical development programme focused on the doses of 100 mg/d and 200 mg/d which were investigated in the pivotal placebo-controlled phase 3 studies. The European study evaluated only the higher dose further to the 2005 Scientific Advice. Results observed in studies assessing the both dose of 100 and 200 mg/d showed that the 100 mg/d dose was almost as efficient as the 200 mg/d dose on most  efficacy  criteria  but  was  better  tolerated.  The  proposed  recommended  dose  is,  therefore,  100 mg/d.

In the short-term phase 3 studies, the 200 mg/d dose appeared to provide some additional benefit in pain and overall global patient's satisfaction. In the US extension studies FMS034 and MLN-MD-04, an additional mean improvement in both pain and physical functioning was observed in the group of patients who switched from milnacipran 100 mg/d in the lead-in studies to 200 mg/d in the extension studies. Last, in the European extension GE 3 04 study, there was a tendency for a greater effect at endpoint for the 200 mg/d dose compared to the 100 and 150 mg/d doses.

Therefore, in the instance of a patient who tolerates the 100 mg/day dose well and does not achieve adequate efficacy, it would be reasonable to propose the 200 mg/day dose on an individual basis. For many patients, 100 mg/day is expected to be adequate. The criteria to decide to increase the dosage to 200 mg/day would always be based on the clinical judgment of the treating physician in consultation with the patient. When the drug is well-tolerated and the patient and the physician mutually decide that adequate symptomatic relief has not been obtained with the initial dosage, then an increase to a dose of 200 mg/day may be considered.

In summary, as the benefit/risk ratio is slightly better with milnacipran 100 mg/day, the recommended dose for milnacipran in the treatment of FM is 100 mg/day. Some patients may benefit from the dose of 200 mg/day on an individual basis.

## CHMP position on the first ground for refusal

The original dossier of milnacipran for the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome included 1 doubleblind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study, 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 pivotal studies and 2 double-blind, phase 3 long-term extension studies. A total of 3445 patients formed the initial safety database. During the evaluation procedure (at day 180) the Applicant submitted the results of two additional studies: one placebo-controlled short-term phase 3 study (study MLN-MD-03) and a longterm extension study (study GE 3 04).

Two doses, 100 mg and 200 mg have been tested in the short-term (12 wk) studies. In these studies the efficacy of milnacipran was based on two main aspects:

- the effect on pain, measured by the VAS score and the Patient Global Impression of Change score in a composite outcome ;
- the global effect over the syndrome including the VAS score,  the Patient Global Impression of Change and a physical function endpoint  (SF-36 PF or FIQ- Physical Function subscore) also measured as a composite outcome.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Efficacy was ultimately expressed as response rates in order to capture a clinically meaningful effect for the patients.

With respect to pain, and based on the primary analyses conducted in each pivotal study, the following results were observed:

*Post-hoc analysis suggested by FDA.

The CHMP commented as follows on these results:

a) As pain reliever, milnacipran appears to have a small effect in fibromyalgic patients with moderate pain. A gain (in terms of responders) over placebo of 6.3% - 10.8% for the 100 mg dose and 7.3% to 9.6% for the 200 mg dose was observed. Although some effect is detected with a consistent trend across clinical trials, it still has to be determined whether a less than 10 percent improvement in the responder rate can be considered clinically relevant. It means that approx. one in 10 to one in 7 FM patients will be improved &gt; 30% by this treatment when compared to the placebo treated patients. The Applicant has submitted throughout the procedure and at the oral explanation several analyses in order to qualify the clinical relevance of these modest figures, but this crucial point has not convincingly solved yet in the view of the CHMP, who considered that the absolute magnitude of the effect shown was low.

It would be helpful whether according to the sought indication 'Treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome', this effect could be translated into a global benefit of the condition (e.g. syndrome composite endpoint, FIQ Total Score).

If the Syndrome criterion (a composite endpoint involving pain, global effect, physical function) is examined, an even more reduced effect is shown (see below).

* Post-hoc analysis suggested by FDA  ** In the EU study GE 302, the FIQ total score (and not the composite score) was used as a functional endpoint

b) This pattern is also reflected in the pain and physical functional secondary endpoints, in which the superiority of milnacipran over placebo appears to be strictly numerical.

When the effect was evaluated through some of the relevant clinical features of the disease such as sleep disturbances, fatigue, psychological or neurocognitive disturbances, milnacipran does not appear to improve the treatment of the condition in a meaningful way.

This concern is also raised when the patients judged their status: patients receiving milnacipran either 100 mg or 200 mg doses defined their change as minimally improved (100 mg: ranged from 2.9 to 3.07 and 200 mg: ranged from 3.02 to 3.1 depending on the study). These changes represent less than 0.5 points of benefit over placebo.

The relevance of this finding is doubtful.

- b) Some doubts have been raised with respect to the true effectiveness of the 100 mg dose and the proposed posology in general.

The main proof of efficacy for this dose has been provided with the US study MLN-MD-03, whose final report was submitted during the re-examination. In this study, patients treated with milnacipran 100 mg for 12 weeks showed significantly greater responder rates (both in pain and syndrome outcomes) than those treated with placebo.  In spite of this, the efficacy of the recommended 100 mg dose has not been adequately demonstrated in an EU clinical setting (see also the discussion below concerning acceptability of US vs. EU data).

The CHMP considered that no significant benefit seems to be obtained from increasing the milnacipran dose from 100 mg to 200 mg.

- c) From the analysis of published studies, which used the FIQ, it was apparent that the course of the disease is very sensitive to various treatments and interventions.

The overall absolute improvement on the 0-100 unit scale obtained with milnacipran is even smaller than the impact of e.g. physical exercise, cognitive behavioural therapy or the use of various antidepressants (Bennet 2005).

The issue of clinical relevance of the observed results was the principal objection during the marketing authorization procedure, and is particularly relevant for fybromyalgia where a number of interventions appear to have some effect, but response to any single treatment modality seems to be poor.

This point is still considered not resolved in view of the CHMP

## CHMP ground for refusal 2: There is an insufficient demonstration of maintenance of effect in appropriately designed studies of relevance to the EU population.

## Summary of Applicant's position:

The maintenance of effect has been investigated in line with existing guidelines and 2005 scientific advice; it provides ample information that the effect of milnacipran is sustained in patients receiving the drug for up to 12 months.

The composition of the clinical dossier regarding the maintenance of effect was specifically discussed with the CHMP during the 2005 Scientific Advice. On this occasion, it was stated that an open label extension was adequate for such an objective.

In  the  view  of  the  Applicant,  the  requirement  for  placebo  controlled  data  is  unexpected  and  in contradiction with the position expressed by the CHMP during the consultation process. It is also in contradiction  with  existing  guidelines  published  by  the  CHMP  for  treatments  in  other  chronic  pain conditions  (see  for  instance  Guideline  CPMP/EWP/252/03Rev.1  'Guideline  on  clinical  medicinal products  intended  for  the  treatment  of  neuropathic  pain')  which  recommend  open  label  extension studies, without placebo, during 6 to 12 months.

The requirement by the CHMP for a placebo group in the extension study is therefore not appropriate; it may be furthermore ethically discussable in a chronic pain condition.

Beyond this contradiction, it is argued that:

- -The  design  of  the  European  extension  study,  with  a  12-month  extension  in  patients  rerandomised  blindly  to  3  different  doses  of  milnacipran  (100,  150  and  200  mg/d),  is  more stringent than what was required at the 2005 Scientific Advice.
- -Extension studies, both in the US (MLN-MD-04) and in the European (GE 3 04) have shown on a total of 852 patients that the continuation of treatment is accompanied by a stability of efficacy parameters over 12 months.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, in order to reach a mutually acceptable position, the applicant proposed that the SmPC be adjusted as follows:

The indication section (§4.1) may read:

'Short term management of fibromyalgia syndrome in adults.

Long term maintenance of effect has not been investigated versus placebo'.

## CHMP position on the second ground for refusal

The short-term effect of milnacipran over placebo is still of uncertain relevance to be considered as a truly established benefit.

When it comes to long-term data, efficacy of milnacipran in fibromyalgia is insufficiently supported by uncontrolled data from studies primarily aimed to assess the safety of milnacipran up to 1 year of treatment.

In this respect, when milnacipran was given for 6-month period time under controlled circumstances (Study FMS031) a lower response than that achieved at 3 months both in pain and syndrome scores was reported. Differences versus placebo in pain responder rates were 7.1% for 200 mg dose and 5.7% for 100 mg. The figures for syndrome responder rates were 1.2% (200 mg) and 0.8% (100 mg). This suggests a potential weaning effect of milnacipran and in any case it casts doubts on the persistence of the effect.

The applicant proposed during the reexamination to restrict the indication to a short-term treatment. A modest short-term effect mainly focused on pain is not deemed enough to grant an indication in a chronic condition without being supported by robust, long-term data.

During the Oral explanation, the applicant suggested that the product information could be amended to continue treatment only in patients responding after 3 months of treatment. However the CHMP remained concerned with regards to the demonstration of maintenance of effect, particularly in light of the high discontinuation rate (40%) in the maintenance phase of study GE 304.

The CHMP considered this point not solved.

## CHMP ground for refusal 3: 'The results from the US studies cannot be extrapolated to the EU population, taking into account the differences in procedures.'

## Summary of Applicant's position:

US study designs, populations and results are coherent with the European studies; the overall clinical package is adequate and relevant for the target European population

The clinical studies were conducted either in the US or in Europe; all methodological precautions were taken in order to ensure adequate characterization of FM patients in each study, and comparability of populations between studies, as described below. US data are considered as relevant as European data since there is no significant restriction which would limit extrapolation of results from the US studies to the European population.

Both  in  the  US  and  in  the  European  studies,  inclusion  criteria  were  defined  in  order  to  include patients'  representative  of  the  established  FM  patient  profile  and  to  ensure  homogeneity  between study populations:

- -in all studies, patients were classified according to the ACR criteria published in 1990;
- -special efforts were made to exclude co-morbidities such as major depression in order to avoid any major confounding factors in the assessment of efficacy;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -similarly,  systemic  autoimmune  diseases,  systemic  infections  or  unstable  endocrine  diseases constitued  also  exclusion  criteria  because  of  the  potential  overlap  of  the  symptomatology  with FM and to ensure that patients included were actually suffering from FM;
- -in line with the well documented epidemiology of FM, the majority of patients are middle-aged female in all studies;
- -associated symptoms and complaints collected in all studies are similar and reflect the profile of symptoms  widely  acknowledged  in  the  FM  population  (muscle  pain,  fatigue,  trouble  falling asleep, morning stiffness, inability to concentrate…);
- -baseline mean scores of efficacy criteria are similar between studies (VAS pain, FIQ, MFI, SF36PCS, SF36-MCS and MOS-Sleep baseline scores).

The baseline differences between regions are limited and only concern the body mass index (BMI), the FM duration and the baseline Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score. These differences do not induce significant bias for efficacy assessment:

- -Differences in BMI are in line with established differences between the US and European overall populations  and  have  been  assessed  by  the  CHMP  to  be  negligible  as  regards  the  impact  on efficacy assessment.
- -FM  duration  was  collected  differently  in  the  pivotal  studies  (duration  of  symptoms  and/or duration  since  FM  diagnosis).  When  the  comparisons  of  similar  criteria  are  performed,  FM duration is actually only marginally longer in the US studies than in the European study: the mean duration since diagnosis was of 5.9 and 4.1 years, respectively in the US FMS031 and European GE 3 02 studies and the mean duration of FM symptomatology was of 10.0, 10.8 and 9.5 years, respectively  in  the  US  MLN-MD-02  ,  US  MLN-MD-03  and  European  GE  3  02  studies.  The absence of impact of FM duration on the assessment of efficacy is furthermore confirmed by the absence of any significant FM 'duration x treatment' interaction in all studies.
- -Differences in baseline BDI between studies are limited:
-  These differences do not reflect actual differences in source populations but result from the evolution of exclusion criteria during the course of development: to ensure that any positive efficacy results was not attributable to the antidepressant effect of milnacipran, exclusion criteria comprised major depressive episode from the very start of development and became more strict during the development with the introduction of a baseline BDI cut-off (mean baseline BDI score is about 14 in the first US studies, 11 in the European GE 3 02 study and 9 in the recently completed US MLN-MD-03 study).
-  These differences do not hinder comparison of results between studies: subgroup analyses did not show any clear impact of baseline BDI score on response to the study treatment.
-  Therefore, for these two reasons, BDI baseline differences do not restrict extrapolation of results from the US studies to the European population.

## Robustness of the results: similar results were observed in all studies, irrespective of the regions

All clinical studies provide results that are qualitatively and quantitatively similar, irrespective of the regions  (US  or  Europe)  where  the  studies  were  performed.  Especially  the  results  of  the  3  positive phase 3 studies are coherent, as summarized below.

## In summary:

Study  populations  and  results  are  appropriate  and  justify  the  use  of  both  European  and  US  study results for the present submission:

- -The composition of the dossier is in line with the 2005 Scientific Advice
- -The characteristics of the population included in the clinical programme are in line with the general FM patient profile
- -Generalisability of results between regions is allowed, since :
- o study populations are globally similar;
- o differences with respect to baseline characteristics (BMI and BDI), drop out rates and concomitant  medications  use  are  limited  and  do  not  induce  any  significant  bias  for efficacy assessment;
- o analyses  testing  for  a  global  region  effect  (corresponding  to  the  aggregation  of  all observed differences between regions) did not show any statistically significant region x treatment interaction;
- o out of the 3 positive pivotal studies one study was exclusively conducted in Europe and  provided  positive  results  with  no  element  in  favour  of  a  lesser  effect  of milnacipran in European patients.

## CHMP position on the third ground for refusal

The MAH provided justification about the similarities in demographic characteristics of patients and the efficacy results of the studies conducted in both regions (US and EU). This is acknowledged.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However,  the  CHMP  considered  that  fibromyalgia  syndrome  possesses  singular  features  in  which local conditions, perceptions and access to additional healthcare interventions take special relevance. Therefore, in this context robust EU efficacy (and safety) data are required, considering results from other regions (i.e. US data) as supportive.  In this dossier only the 200 mg dose has been tested for efficacy  purpose  in  EU  pivotal  trial,  the  proof  of  efficacy  of  the  main  100  mg  dose  relying  on  US patients.

CHMP ground for refusal 4: The safety profile, whilst well characterised, is not considered to be outweighed by the benefits, given the lack of robust evidence of efficacy.

## Summary of Applicant's position:

The safety of milnacipran has been extensively evaluated in all the safety and efficacy phase 2 and phase 3 studies summarized above, in a total of 2,503 FM patients on both a short term basis and a long term basis. Extensive safety information on milnacipran in patients with Major Depressive Disorder was also reviewed on the basis of both clinical study data and post-marketing experience over more than 10 years in an estimated 18.5 million patient x months.

The safety profile of milnacipran is predictable, in agreement with class effects of serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor. No unexpected safety signal has been identified.

The combined review of all these safety data collected in FM and in MDD provides very coherent information: the typology of Adverse Events is very similar between populations. No new and /or unexpected findings were observed in the FM population.

The majority of the most frequent adverse reactions occurred mainly in the first four weeks of therapy and were mild to moderate in severity.

The most commonly reported adverse events drug reactions in fibromyalgia patients treated with milnacipran in clinical trials were nausea, headache, constipation, hyperhidrosis and hot flush.

Increases in blood pressure and in heart rate have been observed with milnacipran, as with other drugs pertaining to the same class. The extensive post marketing exposure experience provides reassuring data on the long-term cardio-vascular safety of milnacipran. Nevertheless, the applicant also took significant measures to ensure the optimal reduction of potential safety risks: the SmPC has been modified accordingly (the Contra-indication section mentions severe cardiac function impairment, uncontrolled hypertension, sever or unstable coronary heart disease), and a risk management plan has been provided with an extensive survey plan along with a commitment to implement a specific observational study.

## CHMP position on the fourth ground for refusal

The long term safety profile of milnacipran is reasonably known and the main risks are currently reasonably identified. This does not entail the absence of risk for those patients who are treated with the drug.  Therefore only an unequivocally positive efficacy assessment could outweigh the potential risks of a non trivial long term treatment.

The CHMP considered this point not solved

CHMP ground for refusal 5: Due to the aforementioned concerns, a satisfactory summary of product characteristics cannot be agreed at this stage.

A revised indication has been suggested by the applicant:

The indication section (§4.1) may read:

'Short term management of fibromyalgia syndrome in adults.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Long term maintenance of effect has not been investigated versus placebo'.

## CHMP position on the fifth ground for refusal

The  applicant  proposed  a  restriction  of  the  indication  to  a  short-term  treatment,  and  further amendments concerning the maintenance treatment during the oral explanation. A modest short-term effect  mainly  focused  on  pain  is  not  deemed  sufficient  to  get  an  indication  on  a  chronic  condition without being supported by robust, long-term data.

At present, the benefit-risk assessment of milnacipran is still negative.

The CHMP considered this point not solved.

## Overall conclusions on grounds for reexamination

The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the applicant and considered the views of the SAG.

With the grounds for re-examination the applicant has reiterated its position regarding the deficiencies identified in the CHMP assessment and provided further discussion of the points forming the ground of refusal by the CHMP. The applicant proposed a restricted indication to the short term management of fibromyalgia syndrome in adults.

However, the CHMP maintained that the estimation of the effect size is not reassuring. This applies not only to pain, but also to functional evaluations.

Therefore the CHMP concluded that even for this restricted indication the benefit-risk assessment of milnacipran  remains  negative  as  the  effect  size  is  considered  modest  and  of  doubtful  clinical relevance.  This  reduced  short-term  effect  is  not  deemed  enough  to  get  an  indication  on  a  chronic condition without being supported by robust, long-term data.

Therefore the CHMP considered the initial grounds for refusal still maintained.

## GROUNDS FOR REFUSAL

Whereas the CHMP considered:

- There  is  a lack  of  robust  evidence  of  efficacy  in  the  short  term,  especially  for  the recommended dose  of  100  mg/day.  Furthermore  the  effect  seen  has  not  been  convincingly shown to be clinically meaningful.
- There  is  an  insufficient  demonstration  of  maintenance  of  effect  in  appropriately  designed studies of relevance to the EU population.
- The  results  from  the  US  studies  cannot  be  extrapolated  to  the  EU  population,  taking  into account the differences in procedures.
- The  safety  profile,  whilst  well  characterised,  is  not  considered  to  be  outweighed  by  the benefits, given the lack of robust evidence of efficacy.
- Due to the aforementioned concerns, a satisfactory summary of product characteristics cannot be agreed at this stage.

The CHMP has recommended the refusal of the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for Impulsor.
