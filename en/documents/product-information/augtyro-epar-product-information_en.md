<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## ROS1 testing

Patient selection for treatment with repotrectinib, based on ROS1positive status in NSCLC should be assessed by a CE-marked IVD with the corresponding intended purpose. If the CE-marked IVD is not available, an alternative validated test should be used (see sections 4.1, and 5.1).

## NTRK testing

Patient selection for treatment with repotrectinib, based on NTRK -positive status in solid tumours should be assessed by a CE-marked IVD with the corresponding intended purpose. If the CE-marked IVD is not available, an alternative validated test should be used (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 5.1).

## Posology

## ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer

The recommended dose in adults is 160 mg repotrectinib once daily for 14 days, followed by 160 mg repotrectinib twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

## NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours

The recommended dose in adults and paediatric patients 12 year and older is 160 mg repotrectinib once daily for 14 days, followed by 160 mg repotrectinib twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

## Missed dose

If a dose is missed or if a patient vomits at any time after taking a dose, subsequent doses should be resumed as prescribed. Two doses should not be taken at the same time.

## Dose modifications for adverse reactions

The recommended dose reductions for adverse reactions are provided in Table 1:

*Graded per NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 4.0

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (≥ 65 years) (see section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. AUGTYRO has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt; 1.0 to 1.5 times ULN or AST &gt; ULN) AUGTYRO has not been studied in patients with moderate (total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 to 3 times ULN) or severe (total bilirubin &gt; 3 times ULN) hepatic impairment, and AUGTYRO should not be used in patients with moderate/severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of AUGTYRO in paediatric patients below 18 years of age with ROS1 -positive NSCLC have not been established.

The safety and efficacy of AUGTYRO in paediatric patients below 12 years of age with NTRK -positive solid tumours have not been established. Currently, available data are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made.

## Method of administration

AUGTYRO is for oral use. The capsules should be swallowed whole at the same time every day. The capsules must not be opened, crushed, chewed, and the contents of the capsule must not be dissolved.

AUGTYRO may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2) but should not be taken with grapefruit, grapefruit juice or Seville oranges (see section 4.5).

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Efficacy across tumour types

The benefit of AUGTYRO has been established in single-arm studies encompassing adult patients (N = 88) whose tumours exhibit NTRK gene fusions. Favourable effects of AUGTYRO have been shown based on overall response rate and response duration in a limited number of tumour types. The effect may be quantitatively different depending on tumour type, as well as on concomitant genomic alterations (see section 5.1).

## Central nervous system (CNS)

A broad spectrum of CNS adverse reactions has been reported in patients receiving AUGTYRO including dizziness, ataxia, and cognitive disorders (see section 4.8).

Patients should be advised of these risks with AUGTYRO as they may influence the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised not to drive or use machines if they are experiencing CNS adverse reactions (see section 4.7). AUGTYRO should be withheld and then resumed at the same or reduced dose upon improvement, or permanently discontinued based on severity (see section 4.2).

## Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis

Patients should be advised to report symptoms of ILD/pneumonitis, which may include shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, chest pain or tightness, and haemoptysis. Patients should be monitored for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. AUGTYRO should be withheld in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinued if ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed (see section 4.2).

## Skeletal fractures

Skeletal fractures have been reported in adults and paediatric patients treated with AUGTYRO across clinical studies. In adult and paediatric patients, some fractures occurred in the setting of a fall or other trauma to the affected area. Radiologic abnormalities possibly indicative of tumour involvement were reported in some patients. In both adult and paediatric patients, most fractures were lower extremity fractures (e.g., fibula, tibia, or foot). Patients with signs or symptoms (e.g., pain, changes in mobility, deformity) of fractures should be promptly evaluated.

## Hepatotoxicity

Drug-induced hepatotoxicity has been reported in patients treated with AUGTYRO (see section 4.8). Liver function tests including ALT, AST and bilirubin should be monitored as clinically indicated.

## Hepatic impairment

AUGTYRO has not been studied in patients with moderate  or severe hepatic impairment. AUGTYRO should not be used in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment due to potential risk of over-exposure and increased risk of adverse events (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## Contraception in female and male

AUGTYRO may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see section 5.3).

Women of childbearing potential should have medically supervised pregnancy testing prior to initiating AUGTYRO therapy. Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception during treatment with AUGTYRO and for 2 months following the final dose. AUGTYRO may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives including oral contraceptives (see sections 4.5 and 4.6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must use condoms during treatment with AUGTYRO and for 4 months after the final dose (see sections 4.6 and 5.3).

## Paediatric population

Long-term safety data are unavailable on the use of AUGTYRO in paediatric patients 12 years of age and older.

## Drug interactions

Co-administration of AUGTYRO use with a strong or moderate CYP3A/P-gp inhibitor increases repotrectinib plasma concentrations (see section 4.5), which may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Co-administration of AUGTYRO with a strong or moderate CYP3A/P-gp inhibitor should be avoided.

During treatment with AUGTYRO, the consumption of grapefruit and grapefruit products should be avoided.

Co-administration of AUGTYRO with a strong or moderate CYP3A/P-gp inducer decreases repotrectinib concentrations (see section 4.5), which may reduce efficacy of AUGTYRO, and should be avoided.

## Excipients

AUGTYRO contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 'sodium free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Based on in vitro data repotrectinib is a substrate for CYP3A4 and P-gp.

## Effects of other agents on repotrectinib

## Effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors and P-gp inhibitors on repotrectinib

Co-administration of multiple oral doses of itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) with a single 80 mg dose of repotrectinib increased repotrectinib AUC0-inf by 5.9-fold and Cmax by 1.7-fold. Co-administration of AUGTYRO with strong or moderate CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors (including but not limited to ritonavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, verapamil, nifedipine, felodipine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit, or Seville oranges) increases repotrectinib plasma concentrations and should thus be avoided (see section 4.4).

## Effect of CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers on repotrectinib

Co-administration of multiple oral doses of rifampicin (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducer) with a single 160 mg repotrectinib dose reduced repotrectinib AUC0-inf by 92% and Cmax by 79%. Coadministration of AUGTYRO with strong or moderate CYP3A4 or P-gp inducers (including but not limited to carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin, St. John's WortHypericum perforatum , apalutamide, ritonavir) decreases repotrectinib plasma concentrations and should thus be avoided (see section 4.4).

## Effects of repotrectinib on other agents

## Effect of repotrectinib on CYP3A4 substrates

Repotrectinib is a moderate CYP3A4 inducer. Co-administration of 160 mg repotrectinib once daily for 14 days followed by twice daily dosing for 7 days reduced AUC0-inf by 69% and Cmax by 48% of a single oral dose of midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate). Caution is advised when CYP3A4 substrates (including but not limited to cisapride, cyclosporin, fentanyl, tacrolimus, alfentanil, sirolimus,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

everolimus, lovastatin, and simvastatin) are co-administered with repotrectinib, due to risk of therapeutic failure.

## Effect of repotrectinib on CYP2B6 substrates

In vitro studies indicate that repotrectinib is a CYP2B6 inducer. Co-administration of AUGTYRO with sensitive substrates of CYP2B6 substrates (including but not limited to bupropion, efavirenz) may decrease their exposure.

## Effect of repotrectinib on substrates of PXR regulated enzymes

In vitro studies indicate that repotrectinib may induce pregnane X receptor (PXR) regulated enzymes that  include  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19  and  UGT. In  vitro data  also  indicate  that  repotrectinib inhibits  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9 and UGT1A1. The in  vivo net  effect  of  induction  and  inhibition,  or  its clinical  relevance,  is  not  known.  Co-administration  of  AUGTYRO  with  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9  or CYP2C19 substrates (including but not limited to repaglinide, warfarin, tolbutamide or omeprazole) may alter their exposure.

## Effect of repotrectinib on other transporter substrates

In vitro data indicate that repotrectinib inhibits P-gp, breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP), organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1), multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE1) and MATE2-K. Co-administration of AUGTYRO with sensitive substrates of P-gp ( including but not limited to dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, edoxaban, or fexofenadine), BCRP (including but not limited to methotrexate, rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine), OATP1B1 (including but not limited to valsartan, statins), MATE1 or MATE2-K (including but not limited to metformin) may increase their exposure. The clinical relevance is unknown.

## Oral contraceptives

Repotrectinib is a moderate CYP3A4 inducer, which can decrease progestin or oestrogen exposure to an extent that could reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives including oral contraceptives. Thus, women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives are advised to use a barrier method (see section 4.6).

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/ Contraception in males and females

Female patients of childbearing potential should have medically supervised pregnancy testing prior to initiating AUGTYRO therapy.

Female patients of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception during treatment with AUGTYRO and for at least 2 months following the final dose. AUGTYRO may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives including oral contraceptives. If hormonal contraception is used, females of childbearing potential should be advised to use an additional barrier method of contraception (see section 4.5).

Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must use condoms during treatment and for 4 months following the final dose of AUGTYRO.

## Pregnancy

There are no available data on AUGTYRO use in pregnant women. Based on animal studies and its mechanism of action, repotrectinib may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women. AUGTYRO should not be used unless clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AUGTYRO. Women of childbearing potential have to use highly effective contraception (see sections 4.4 and 5.3).

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether repotrectinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with AUGTYRO and for 10 days after the final dose.

## Fertility

No fertility studies have been conducted with repotrectinib (see section 5.3). The effect of repotrectinib on male and female fertility is unknown.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

AUGTYRO has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised of potential CNS effects and vision disorders with AUGTYRO as these effects may influence the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised not to drive or use machines if they are experiencing CNS adverse reactions and vision disorders (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common adverse reactions in adults were dizziness (65%), dysgeusia (57%), constipation (39%), paraesthesia (39%), anaemia (38%), and dyspnoea (31%). The most common serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (6.2%), dyspnoea (3.5%), pleural effusion (3.0%), pyrexia (1.2%), muscular weakness (1.1%), anaemia (1.1%), and pneumonitis (1.1%). Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions occurred in 43% of patients and anaemia (8.8%), dyspnoea (6.7%), pneumonia (5.7%), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (3.4%), weight increased (3.2%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (2.7%), pleural effusion (2.3%), and neutrophil count decreased (2.1%) were the most frequently reported. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 6.2% patients.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Tables 3 and 4 summarise the adverse reactions reported in patients treated with AUGTYRO in the TRIDENT-1 study in adults (n = 565) and in the CARE study (n = 38) including paediatric patients respectively. These reactions are presented by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); very rare (&lt; 1/10 000). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

Unless otherwise stated, the frequencies of adverse reactions are based on all-cause adverse event frequencies identified in patients exposed to AUGTYRO with a median duration of 7.6 months in clinical study. See section 5.1 for information on the main clinical study.

The median time to onset was 19 days (range: 1 day to 2.9 years). Resolution occurred in 120 patients (78.9%) with median time to resolution 5 weeks (0.7+ weeks to 92.0+ weeks). Dose interruption was required in 3% (17/565) of patients, 1.2% (7/565) of patients required dose reduction.

## Vision disorder

Among the 565 patients who received AUGTYRO, vision changes occurred in 14.2 % (80/565) of patients, including Grade 3 vision disorder in 0.5% (3/565). Vision disorders included blurred vision (4.1%), visual impairment (2.3%), dry eye (1.6%). Resolution occurred in 34 patients (42.5%) with a range of time to resolution of 0.1 weeks to 226.9+ weeks. Dose interruption was required in 1.2% (7/565) of patients, 0.2% (1/565) of patients required dose reduction, and 0.2% (1/565) of patients permanently discontinued AUGTYRO due to vision disorders.

## Muscular weakness

AUGTYRO can cause muscle weakness with or without creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation. Among the 565 patients treated with AUGTYRO, muscle weakness occurred in 21.6% (122/565) of patients, with Grade 3 in 1.9% (11/565). Median time to onset of muscle weakness was 39 days (range: 1 day to 3.4 years). Resolution occurred in 49 patients (40.2%) with median time to resolution 86.6 weeks (0.3 weeks to 236.6+ weeks). Dose interruption was required in 5.5% (31/565) of patients, 4.8% (27/565) of patients required dose reduction, and 0.9% (5/565) of patients permanently discontinued AUGTYRO due to muscle weakness.

## Paediatric population

The safety of AUGTYRO was evaluated in 38 paediatric patients (including 22 paediatric patients &lt; 12 years of age, 14 paediatric patients 12-17 years of age and 2 patients ≥ 18 years of age) with advanced or metastatic tumours harbouring ALK , ROS1 , or NTRK1-3 gene fusions in the phase I/II, open-label, single-arm, multicentre, multicohort CARE study. Of the 14 patients between the age of 12 and 17, 7 patients were NTRK positive.

Adverse reactions observed in paediatric patients were comparable in frequency and intensity to those observed in adults except skeletal fractures which were observed at a higher frequency in paediatric patients (18.4%) compared to adults (3.5%). No differences in the spectrum of adverse reactions reported in adults and the paediatric population were evident with no new or unexpected adverse reactions observed. The events reported in the adult population can also be observed in children and adolescents. The most frequent adverse reactions in paediatric patients were constipation, fatigue and headache. The most frequent Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions in paediatric patients were weight increased, diarrhoea, and skeletal fractures.

## Elderly

Of the 565 patients who received AUGTYRO 25% were 65 years or older, and 6% were 75 years of age or older. The frequency of adverse reactions was generally similar for patients &lt; 65 years of age and patients ≥ 65 years of age. The frequencies of serious adverse reactions were higher in patients 65-75 years of age (48%) and ≥ 75 years of age (63%) compared to patients 18-65 years of age (37%). The most common serious adverse reactions in patients ≥ 65 years of age were pneumonia, dyspnoea, and pleural effusion. The rate of discontinuations was higher in patients 65-75 years of age (16%) and ≥ 75 years of age (23%) compared to patients 18-65 years of age (9%).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is limited experience of overdose with AUGTYRO. Symptoms of overdose are not established. In the event of overdose, physicians should follow general supportive measures and treat symptomatically.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EX28

## Mechanism of action

Repotrectinib is an inhibitor of proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS1, the tropomyosin receptor tyrosine kinases (TRK) TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) with IC50 values of 0.05 to 1.04 nM.

Fusion proteins that include ROS1 or TRK domains can drive tumourigenic potential through hyperactivation of downstream signalling pathways leading to unconstrained cell proliferation. Repotrectinib has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo inhibition of cell lines expressing the targeted fusion oncogenes ROS1, TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, and corresponding mutations (ROS1 G2032R , ROS1 D2033N , TRKA G595R , TRKB G639R , TRKC G623R ). Repotrectinib binds inside the boundary of the ATP-binding pocket and avoids steric interference from both solvent front and gatekeeper mutations.

## Cardiac Electrophysiology

Analysis of ECG data from 334 patients in the TRIDENT-1 phase 2 study, who received AUGTYRO at the recommended dose (unknown prandial state), demonstrated that the upper limit of 90% confidence interval (CI) of the mean QTcF change from baseline (ΔQTcF) exceeded 10 milliseconds (ms) for a few time point estimates but remained &lt; 20 ms.

Patients with increased risk of QTc prolongation were not enrolled in TRIDENT-1.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The efficacy of repotrectinib was evaluated in adult patients with solid tumours harboring ROS1 or NTRK1-3 rearrangements in a phase I /II, multicentre, single-arm, open-label, multi-cohort clinical study (TRIDENT-1). Patients received various doses and schedules of repotrectinib (156 [91%] received repotrectinib 160 mg orally once daily for the first 14 days of treatment followed by 160 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity).

The primary efficacy endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1. The secondary endpoints were duration of response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS) by BICR according to RECIST v1.1 and overall survival (OS). Intracranial response according to modified RECIST v1.1 was assessed by BICR. Tumour assessments with imaging were performed at least every 8 weeks.

## ROS1-positive NSCLC

The efficacy of repotrectinib was evaluated in a subgroup of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic ROS1 -positive NSCLC pooled from phase I/II of TRIDENT-1. Patients were required to have ECOG performance status ≤ 1, measurable disease per RECIST v 1.1 , ≥ 8 months follow-up

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

from first dose. Identification of ROS1 fusions in tumour specimens was prospectively determined in local laboratories using next-generation sequencing (NGS), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) tests. All ROS1 -positive tumours by local FISH testing required central laboratory confirmation using an analytically validated NGS test. ROS1 fusions were identified by NGS in 57%, FISH in 22%, and PCR in 21% of patients. All patients were assessed for CNS lesions at baseline.

Among the 121 ROS1 inhibitor naïve patients, the median age was 57 years (range: 28 - 93), 23% and 5% were 65 years or older and 75 years or older respectively. The majority were female (56%) Asian (60%) or White (30%); and never smoked (63%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (38%) and 1 (62%). At baseline, 92% of patients had metastatic disease, 25% of patients had CNS metastases by BICR; 97% of patients had adenocarcinoma; 26% of patients had prior platinum-based chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease.

Among the 107 patients who had received 1 prior ROS1 TKI (crizotinib 77%, entrectinib 21%, and ceritinib 3%) with no prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the median age was 57 years, (range: 33-81), 29% and 8% were 65 years or older and 75 years or older, respectively. The majority were female (74%), Asian (42%) or White (49%); never smoked (68%); and ECOG performance status of 0 (34%) and 1 at baseline (66%). At baseline, 98% patients had metastatic disease, 40% had CNS metastases by BICR, and 96% had adenocarcinoma.

Efficacy results are summarised in Table 5.

## NTRK gene-fusion-positive solid tumours

The efficacy of repotrectinib was evaluated in a population of patients with locally advanced (not eligible for surgery, radiation or multimodality therapy) or metastatic NTRK gene fusion positive solid tumours pooled from phase I /II. Patients were required to have ECOG performance status ≤ 1, and measurable disease per RECIST v 1.1 and ≥ 8 months follow-up from first dose. Identification of NTRK gene fusions in tumour specimens was prospectively determined in local laboratories using NGS, PCR or FISH tests. All NTRK 1-3 gene fusion positive tumours by local FISH testing required central laboratory confirmation using an analytically validated NGS test. NTRK fusions were identified by NGS in 96%, FISH in 2.5%, and PCR in 1.7% of patients. All patients were assessed for CNS lesions at baseline.

Among the 51 TKI-naive patients in phase I/II, the median age was 61 years (range: 25-84); 41% and 12% were 65 years or older and 75 years or older respectively. The majority were female (53%); Asian (51%) or White (25%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (45%) and 1 (55%). At baseline, 96% of patients had metastatic disease and 20% patients had CNS metastases by BICR. The most common tumours were NSCLC 53%, thyroid cancer 12%, salivary gland cancer 10%, and soft tissue sarcoma 6%.

Among the 69 TKI-pretreated patients in phase I/II, 17% of patients had received 2 prior TKI therapies, 52% of patients had received larotrectinib and 46% entrectinib, the median age was 56 years (range: 18-81); 36% and 7% were 65 years or older and 75 years or older respectively. The patients were female (48%); Asian (30%) or White (58%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (39%) and 1 (61%). At baseline, 91% of patients had metastatic disease and 23% of patients had CNS metastases by BICR. The most common tumours were NSCLC 25%, salivary gland cancer 17%, soft tissue sarcoma 15%, and thyroid cancer 10%.

ORR and DOR were assessed by BICR and according to RECIST v1.1. Intracranial response according to modified RECIST v1.1 was assessed by BICR. Tumour assessments with imaging were performed at least every 8 weeks. The primary efficacy populations included 51 TKI inhibitor naïve patients and 69 patients who had received 1 prior TKI inhibitor. Efficacy results with a minimum follow-up of 8 months are summarised in Table 6.

Due to the rarity of NTRK gene fusion-positive cancers, patients were studied across multiple tumour types with limited numbers of patients in some tumour types, causing uncertainty in the ORR estimate per tumour type. The ORR in the total population may not reflect the expected response in a specific tumour type.

AUGTYRO was evaluated in paediatric patients with locally advanced or metastatic tumours harbouring NTRK alteration in the phase I/II, open-label, single-arm, multicentre, multicohort CARE study. Efficacy was evaluated in patients who received AUGTYRO orally either as 160 mg once daily,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

or 160 mg once daily for 14 days followed by 160 mg twice daily or adult equivalent dose, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients were required to have Lansky (&lt; 16 years) or Karnofsky (≥ 16 years) score of at least 50, and measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 or Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO). Patients with a primary CNS tumour or CNS metastases were required to be neurologically stable and on a stable or decreasing dose of steroids for at least 14 days prior to enrolment.

Identification of NTRK1-3 gene fusions in tumour specimens was prospectively determined in local laboratories using NGS, PCR or FISH tests. All NTRK gene fusion positive tumours by local FISH testing require retrospective central laboratory confirmation using an analytically validated NGS test.

Primary efficacy endpoints were ORR by BICR according to RECIST v1.1 or RANO and secondary efficacy endpoints were DOR and PFS by BICR according to RECIST v1.1 or RANO and OS. Tumour assessments with imaging were performed at least every 8 weeks.

Thirteen NTRK positive paediatric patients (age range: 1 year to 15 years old; 5 were 12-17 years of age), had measurable disease at baseline per BICR and at least one post baseline scan were evaluated in CARE study. Of these, 5 were NTRK TKI naive (3 CNS tumours and 2 solid tumours) and 8 had received prior NTRK TKI therapy (3 CNS tumours and 5 solid tumours).

Of the 5 TKI naïve patients, 1 complete response and 2 partial responses were observed. Among the 8 TKI-pretreated patients, there were 2 partial responses.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for repotrectinib have been characterised in patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours, ROS1 -positive NSCLC, and in healthy subjects. Repotrectinib maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve over time to infinity (AUC0-inf) increases were approximately dose proportional (but less than linear) with estimated slopes of 0.78 and 0.70, respectively over the single dose range of 40 mg to 240 mg. Steady state PK was time-dependent due to autoinduction of CYP3A4. The steady-state average concentration (Cavg) of 160 mg twice daily dosing regimen is similar to Cavg following 160 mg single dose administration.

Repotrectinib estimated steady state geometric mean (CV%) Cmax is 572 ng/mL (38.3%), Cmin is 158 ng/mL (57.7%), and Cavg (AUC0-12h divided by dosing interval) is 347 ng/mL (42.3%) for 160 mg twice a day.

## Absorption

Following oral administration of ascending single doses of repotrectinib ranging from 40 mg to 240 mg, repotrectinib exhibited rapid absorption with Cmax occurring at approximately 2-3 hours post

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dose under fasted conditions. The geometric mean (CV%) absolute bioavailability of repotrectinib is 45.7% (19.6%).

A high-fat, high-calorie meal (916 calories, 56% fat) increased repotrectinib AUC0-inf by 56% and Cmax by 149% following a single 160 mg oral dose (administered as 40 mg capsules). In another study, a high-fat, high-calorie meal increased AUC0-inf by 42% and Cmax by 110% following a single 160 mg oral dose (administered as 160 mg capsules). Similar increases (AUC0-inf by 36% and Cmax by 124%) were observed with a low-fat, low-calorie meal.

Repotrectinib peak concentration occurred at approximately 4 to 6 hours post a single oral dose of 40 mg to 160 mg under fed conditions (high-fat meal).

## Distribution

Binding of repotrectinib to human plasma protein was 95.4% in vitro . The blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.56 in vitro . The geometric mean (CV%) apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 432 L (55.9%) in cancer patients following a single 160 mg oral dose of repotrectinib.

## Biotransformation

Repotrectinib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 to form hydroxylated metabolites followed by secondary glucuronidation. No metabolite exceeded 10% of total circulating drug-related radioactivity.

## Elimination

Repotrectinib elimination is time-dependent due to autoinduction of CYP3A4.

The geometric mean (CV%) apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 15.9 L/h (45.5%) in cancer patients following a single 160 mg oral dose of repotrectinib. Based on the population PK (popPK) analysis, the single dose mean (SD) terminal half-life (t1/2) was estimated to be 68.6 (29.6) hours, and the steady state terminal t1/2 was estimated to be 44.5 (20.8) hours in cancer patients.

Following a single oral 160 mg dose of [ 14 C] repotrectinib, 4.84% (0.56% as unchanged) of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and 88.8% (50.6% as unchanged) in faeces.

## Pharmacokinetics in special populations

## Renal impairment

In the popPK analysis, mild (eGFR-CKD-EPI 60 to 90 mL/min, n = 139) or moderate (eGFR-CKDEPI 30 to 60 mL/min, n = 27) renal impairment did not influence the clearance of repotrectinib. Repotrectinib has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR- CKD-EPI &lt; 30 mL/min).

## Hepatic impairment

In the popPK analysis, mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt; 1.0 to 1.5 times ULN or AST &gt;ULN, n = 59) did not influence the clearance of repotrectinib. Pharmacokinetics of repotrectinib have not been established in patients with moderate (total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 to 3 times ULN) or severe (total bilirubin &gt; 3 times ULN) hepatic impairment.

## Effects of age, body weight, race and gender

In the popPK analysis, no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of repotrectinib were identified based on gender, age (18 years to 93 years), body weight (39.5 kg to 169 kg), or race (Asian and White) in adults.

## Paediatrics

PK data was available from paediatric patients 12 years and older (n = 13, age 13 to 15 years, body weight 46.4 to 76.7 kg). Based on popPK simulations, adolescents 12 years and older have similar

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

systemic exposure as that of adults when administered the adult dose of 160 mg once daily for 14 days, followed by 160 mg twice daily.

## In vitro studies

CYP Enzymes: Repotrectinib induces CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and inhibits CYP3A4/5 (GI tract), CYP2C8 and CYP2C9.

Other Metabolic Pathways: Repotrectinib inhibits UGT1A1.

Transporter Systems: Repotrectinib inhibits P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, MATE1 and MATE2-K. Repotrectinib is a substrate for P-gp and a potential substrate for MATE2-K and BCRP.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity studies with repotrectinib were not conducted.

## Genotoxicity

Repotrectinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay.

Repotrectinib caused micronuclei formations via an aneugenic mechanism in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells in vitro , and in bone marrow of rats in vivo at doses &gt; 100 mg/kg nominal dose. The exposure of animals at the no observed effect level (NOEL) for aneugenicity was approximately 3.4-fold human exposure at the recommended clinical dose (based on AUC).

## Reproductive toxicity

In a preliminary embryo-foetal development study in rats, teratogenic and embryo-foetal effects (foetal external malformation of malrotated hindlimbs and decreased foetal weight) and maternal effects (skin scabbing and abrasions in cervical and thoracic regions and increased body weight) were observed in pregnant rats at exposures that were less than 2-fold human exposure at the recommended clinical dose.

Dedicated fertility studies were not conducted with repotrectinib. There were no effects on male and female reproductive organs observed in general toxicology studies conducted in rats and monkeys at any dose level tested, which equated to exposures in rats of up to 2-fold and 2.6-fold in males and females, respectively, and exposures in monkeys that were below the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose.

## Repeat dose toxicity studies

Following repeat-dose oral administration of repotrectinib daily for up to 3 months, the main toxicities observed in rats at exposure levels &lt; 3-fold human exposure were skin scabs/ulcerations, CNS effects (i.e. ataxia, tremors), decreased RBC parameters, and bone marrow hypocellularity.

The main toxicities observed in monkeys at exposure margins below clinical exposure were emesis, watery faeces, minimal subacute/chronic inflammation and/or minimal to mild mucosal gland hyperplasia in the large intestines, and decreased RBC parameters. The skin ulcerations were considered secondary to NTRK inhibition resulting in loss of sensation and bodily injury.

## Juvenile rat toxicity studies

Overall, juvenile rats were dosed and evaluated up to 58 days (starting on postnatal day [PND] 12 through PND 70) in repeat-dose toxicity studies. CNS-related mortality was observed at PND 13 to PND 15 (approximately equivalent to infant) at exposure levels ≥ 1.5-fold adolescent human exposure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Decreased effects on growth (decreased body weight, food consumption and femur length) were observed at exposure levels ≥ 0.1-fold the adolescent human exposure.

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What AUGTYRO is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you take AUGTYRO
3. How to take AUGTYRO
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store AUGTYRO
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What AUGTYRO is and what it is used for

## What AUGTYRO is

AUGTYRO is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance repotrectinib.

## What AUGTYRO is used for

## AUGTYRO is used to treat either:

- adults with a type of lung cancer called 'non-small cell lung cancer' (NSCLC) that is caused by a change in the ROS1 gene or,
- adults and children 12 years of age and older with solid tumour (cancer) in various parts of the body that is caused by a change in the NTRK gene.

## ROS1 -positive non-small cell lung cancer

## AUGTYRO is used when:

- a test has shown that your cancer cells have a change in a gene called ' ROS1 ' (see 'How AUGTYRO works' below), and
- your cancer is advanced - for example, has spread to other parts of your body (metastatic).

## NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumour cancer

## AUGTYRO is used when:

- a test has shown that your cancer cells have a change in a gene called ' NTRK ' and has spread within the affected organ or to other organs in your body, or if surgery to remove

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the cancer is likely to result in severe complications (see 'How AUGTYRO works' below), and

- you have received prior treatment with medicines called NTRK inhibitors, or
- you have not received treatment with medicines called NTRK inhibitors and other treatments are not suitable for you.

## How AUGTYRO works

AUGTYRO works by blocking the action of proteins that do not work properly as a result of changes in the NTRK or ROS1 genes that make them. These abnormal proteins can cause cancer cells to grow uncontrollably. By blocking the abnormal proteins, AUGTYRO may slow or stop cancer cell growth and may help shrink your cancer.

## 2. What you need to know before you take AUGTYRO

## Do not take AUGTYRO

- if you are allergic to repotrectinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking AUGTYRO.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking AUGTYRO if

- you have recently experienced dizziness, memory loss, confusion, hallucinations, mental status changes, loss of muscle coordination, or uncoordinated or unsteady walking.
- you have ever had any other lung problems. Tell your doctor right away if you have any new or worsening symptoms including shortness of breath, or cough, or fever.
- you have a history of fractured bones, or condition which may increase your risk of breaking bones.
- if you have liver problems.

## Other medicines and AUGTYRO

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines for:

- Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)/Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection - such as ritonavir, saquinavir, efavirenz
- fungal infections (anti-fungals) - such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole
- stopping seizures or fits (anti-epileptics) - such as carbamazepine or phenytoin
- tuberculosis - such as rifampicin
- depression - such as bupropion, fluvoxamine, or an herbal medicine St. John's Wort ( Hypericum perforatum )
- cancers - such as apalutamide, everolimus
- suppressing your body's immune system, or prevent the body from rejecting an organ transplant - such as sirolimus, tacrolimus, cyclosporin, sulfasalazine
- inflammed joints or joint autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis) - methotrexate
- severe pain - such as alfentanil, fentanyl
- high blood pressure - such as verapamil, nifedipine, felodipine, valsartan
- lowering blood cholesterol - such as lovastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin
- lowering blood sugar levels - such as repaglinide, tolbutamide, metformin
- gastric reflux (heartburn) - such as cisapride, omeprazole
- preventing formation of blood clots - such as warfarin, dabigatran etexilate
- heart problems - such as digoxin, edoxaban

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- allergies - such as fexofenadine
- birth control - if you are using hormonal oral contraceptives, you must also use a reliable barrier method of contraception (see Pregnancy and breast-feeding).

## AUGTYRO with food and drink

Do not drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit or Seville oranges during your treatment with AUGTYRO. It may increase the amount of the medicine in your blood to a harmful level.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

## Women and contraception

You should avoid becoming pregnant while taking this medicine because it could harm the baby. If you are able to become pregnant, you must use highly effective contraception while on treatment and for at least 2 months after stopping treatment.

It is not known if AUGTYRO can reduce the effect of birth control medicines (pills or implanted hormonal contraceptives). If you use hormonal birth control, you should use an additional reliable non-hormonal method of birth control such as a barrier method (e.g. condom) so you do not become pregnant while you are taking AUGTYRO and for 2 months after you stop treatment.

Talk to your doctor about the right methods of contraception for you and your partner.

## Men and contraception

Your female partner should avoid becoming pregnant while you are taking this medicine because it could harm the baby. If your female partner is able to become pregnant, you should use condoms while on treatment and for at least 4 months after stopping treatment.

Talk to your doctor about the right methods of contraception for you and your partner.

## Pregnancy

- Do not take AUGTYRO if you are pregnant. This is because it may harm your baby.
- If you are a woman who can become pregnant, your doctor will arrange pregnancy testing for you before you start treatment with AUGTYRO.
- If you become pregnant when taking the medicine or during the 2 months after taking your last dose, tell your doctor right away.

## Breast-feeding

Do not breast-feed while taking this medicine. This is because it is not known if AUGTYRO can pass over into breast milk and could therefore harm your baby.

## Driving and using machines

AUGTYRO may affect your ability to drive or use machines. AUGTYRO may cause you to:

- feel dizzy
- impaired balance or coordination
- pass out (lose consciousness)
- feel tired
- have changes in your mental status, feel confused or see things that are not there (hallucinations)
- have blurred vision

If this happens, you should not drive, use a bicycle, or use machines until your symptoms resolve. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about whether it is okay for you to drive, cycle or use machines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>
