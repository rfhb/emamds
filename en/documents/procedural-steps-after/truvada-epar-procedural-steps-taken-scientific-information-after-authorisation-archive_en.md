The final results of this DUS in HIV-1 infected children show a low adherence to the renal monitoring recommendations. The dissemination of a new educational brochure to physicians of paediatric HIV-infected patients would be of limited impact, following the recent redistribution of paediatric educational brochures at the end of 2017 for the extension of Truvada indication in HIV-1 infected adolescents. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the use of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) as part of antiretroviral regimens in children and adolescent will ultimately be replaced by tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)- containing regimens for which a lesser impact on bone and renal function is expected. Furthermore, the results of this DUS suggest that there |

This is a Phase 1, open-label, multiple-dose study that evaluated the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction potential between Harvoni (ledipasvir [LDV]/sofosbuvir [SOF]) and FTC/TDF+dolutegravir (DTG). C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data                                 |            |            |             | tenofovir (TFV; the metabolite of TDF) was observed following coadministration of Harvoni and FTC/TDF+DTG, compared with FTC/TDF+DTG alone. The overall tenofovir exposures observed in this study were in the range of those observed when TDF is administered as part of a boosted regimen notably. No clinically significant drug interactions were observed between emtricitabine or dolutegravir and Harvoni. Accordingly, Truvada and Viread can be coadministered with Harvoni without dose adjustment but with close monitoring of renal function as the increased exposure of tenofovir could potentiate adverse reactions associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, including renal disorders. Renal function should be closely monitored.                                     |

The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. | 01/04/2016 | 18/08/2016 | SmPC and PL           | Nucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most pronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these have predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine. The main adverse reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia). These events have often been transitory. Late onset neurological disorders have been reported rarely |

These findings do not affect current national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission of HIV.   |

| WS/0564 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Submission of the final phase 3 clinical study report (Study GS-99-903) as a worksharing procedure to fulfil a Viread, Truvada and Eviplera Post- Authorisation Measure (PAM). This study was extended to evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in particular to collect long-term exposure information on BMD and bone events. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | 25/09/2014 | n/a | The results from this extension phase tend to show that the median decrease in bone mineral density observed through the first 24-48 weeks of treatment seems to remain relatively stable over 13 years of treatment. As regards bone fractures, 8 events were reported during the study. All of them were trauma-related, not considered related to tenofovir or Truvada and were recovered. As regards the renal function, the median change in eGFRCG seems not clinically relevant (with no subjects experiencing eGFRCG below 50 mL/min) and glomerular function remained stable through study. No Fanconi syndrome or tubulopathy was reported. The only renal SAE reported was kidney pain which was not related to study drug. No new safety concern was raised from these final study results.

Update of section 4.4 'Special warnings and precautions for use' of the SmPC for Atripla, Emtriva, Eviplera, Stribild, Truvada, Viread and Vitekta to revise the wording regarding the risk of sexual transmission of HIV infection following CHMP request adopted in December 2013. The PL has been updated accordingly. Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity of this worksharing to update the PL with the details of the local representatives for Croatia and to introduce the Croatian language annexes for Emtriva and to update the bottle label to include the EDQM short standard term for the pharmaceutical form for Stribild. | 20/03/2014 | 10/03/2015 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | During recent years conclusive evidence has been collected which shows that the risk for HIV patients, who are well treated, to sexually transmit HIV to their partner is exceedingly low. A position statement on the use of antiretroviral therapy to reduce HIV transmission was published by the British HIV Association (BHIVA) in January 2013. As a consequence, the recommendations for post- exposure prophylaxis have also been changed in recently updated HIV treatment guidelines. For example, the 2013 BHIVA guideline does not generally recommend post- exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after exposure from a patient with well treated HIV. Based on these data, the wording on the risk of transmission for HIV products was revised to reflect the current scientific knowledge. While effective suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent |

This review identified a total of 104 cases of IRS cumulative to 29th February 2008 for emtricitabine- and tenofovir DF- containing products. 18 cases were identified reporting hepatic disorders as the manifestation of IRS involved: one case with Emtriva, four with Truvada, eight with Viread, and five with Emtriva and Viread.). Based on this review the MAH submitted this variation to include a warning for HIV infected patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus. These patients may experience acute exacerbations of hepatitis associated with immune reactivation syndrome following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. |

| II/0044   | Update the dosing recommendations for renal impairment in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SPC to reflect the results of a study conducted in HIV-1 infected renal impaired patients and changes made for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate's product information as regards renal impairment. The contact details for the local representatives in Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden were updated in section 6 of the PL. Futhermore, minor linguistic amendments were made to the German and Greek versions of the annexes, as relevant. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   | 20/11/2008   | 22/12/2008   | SmPC and PL   | Limited available data from an open label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in combination with emtricitabine for 48 weeks in treatment- naïve and treatment-experienced HIV 1 infected patients with different degrees of renal impairment is now reflected in section 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SPC. This study, which enrolled only 8 patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, supports the existing advice that no dose adjustment to the normal once daily dosing is required in patients with mild renal impairment. However, very careful consideration and benefit risk assessment is needed in all patients with Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) <60 ml/min. The limited data available indicate that in patients with borderline CrCl (close to 50 ml/min), current dosing recommendation of one tablet in every 24 h resulted in 2- to 4-fold increase in tenofovir exposure which was accompanied by decreased renal function and   |

In section 4.4 of the SPC, the term Pneumocystis carinni pneumonia was replaced by Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia which is a more medically accepted term.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|         | In addition minor linguistic changes are made to the German version of the annexes in order to further improve clarity. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   |            |            |                        | Section 4.4 of the SPC and section 3 of the PL were updated regarding post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis following discontinuation of therapy. This includes addition of a recommendation not to discontinue Truvada in patients with cirrhosis or advanced liver disease. Section 4.8 of the SPC and section 4 of the PL were updated to include hypokalaemia, hepatic steatosis, rhabdomyolysis, and muscular weakness and wording to indicate that osteomalacia may be manifested as bone pain and infrequently contribute to fractures. Explanatory text was added in section 4.8 to indicate that the adverse reactions of rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia, hypokalaemia, muscular weakness, myopathy, and hypophosphatemia may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy and that these events are not considered to be causally associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF) therapy in the absence of proximal renal tubulopathy.   |

| II/0036 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC with 144 week efficacy, safety and resistance data of study GS-01-934 in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral naïve patients comparing emtricitabine, tenofovir DF in combination with efavirenz versus with lamivudine/zidovudine and efavirenz. Minor linguistic changes were made in the German and Greek PL. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 24/01/2008 | 28/02/2008 | SmPC and PL | The 144 week data show that a significantly higher proportion of subjects in the emtricitabine + tenofovir DF group (71%) compared with the lamivudine/zidovudine group (58%) achieved and maintained plasma HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/ml. The corresponding percentages for HIV 1 RNA < 50 copies/ml were not statistically significantly different between the groups. The 144 week resistance analysis showed that mutations associated with resistance to efavirenz (predominantly K103N) or with resistance to emtricitabine or lamivudine (M184V/I) occurred less often in the emtricitabine + tenofovir group than in the lamivudine/zidovudine group. It is notable that no subject developed the K65R mutation that can be selected by tenofovir. In relation to co-infected HIV-1/HBV patients, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the potential efficacy of emtricitabine/tenofovir DF and its relative efficacy vs lamivudine in controlling HBV replication based on the limited number of co-infected patients in this study (n=13 with a mixture of HBeAg+ and HBeAg-). The long term safety data in antiretroviral naïve patients are reassuring as regards the safety profile of the combined use of emtricitabine + tenofovir DF. There appeared to be less nausea and anaemia with this regimen then with lamivudine/zidovudine. |

Treatment was discontinued in 5% in the emtricitabine + tenofovir DF group due to treatment-emergent adverse events and 11% in the lamivudine/zidovudine group. Smaller increases in fasting serum triglycerides and total cholesterol levels occurred in the emtricitabine/tenofovir DF group compared with the lamivudine/zidovudine group. The emtricitabine/tenofovir group demonstrated a preferential effect on lipid metabolism and limb fat compared to lamivudine/zidovudine.                                                                                                                                                    |

| II/0035 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet Update of section 4.8 of the SPC to include \"anaemia\" to the list of adverse reactions and update of section 4.5 with information from the tacrolimus interaction study, as requested by the CHMP following the assessment of the 4th PSUR (covering the period from 3 August 2006 to 2 February 2007). Section 4 of the PL is amended accordingly. Furthermore minor linguistic changes were introduced to the Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Estonian, French, German, Greek, Icelandic, Italian, Latvian, Polish, Romanian, Slovakian and Slovenian SPC, Labelling and PL, as relevant. | 15/11/2007 | 18/12/2007 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | Data from a cumulative review of anaemia cases in adult patients on treatment with emtricitabine as well as data from clinical trials suggested that emtricitabine can cause anaemia, in between 0.5 and 1.0% of patients. Based on these findings, \"anaemia\" was included in the Emtriva product information as an uncommon adverse reaction to emtricitabine treatment in adult patients, in a variation approved in August 2007. For consistency, \"anaemia\" is now also being added in the Truvada product information as an uncommon adverse reaction. In addition, results from a pharmacokinetic study did not show any clinically relevant drug-drug interactions between Truvada and tacrolimus. This information has been included in the SPC. |

| II/0029 | Update of sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SPC with renal safety information including updated dosing guidelines based on an analysis of relevant tenofovir disoproxil fumarate clinical studies. The MAH also took the opportunity to update the EMEA website address in the SPC and PL. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet | 22/03/2007 | 24/04/2007 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Tenofovir exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment. A dosing interval adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) and Truvada is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) and in haemodialysis patients. However, concerning patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min), limited available data from three clinical studies have not indicated that the safety and efficacy profile of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is different to the profile in patients with normal renal function. These limited data tend to support the existing advice that no dosing adjustment to the normal once daily dosing is required in patients with mild renal impairment. This information was reflected in section 4.2 of the SPC. Section 4.4 of the SPC was also updated with renal safety information concerning possible renal adverse events and the need to assess the potential benefit of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy in patients with moderate renal impairment against the potential risk of renal toxicity. |

| II/0025   | Update of section 4.5 SPC to reflect the results of a pharmacokinetic study investigating the potential interactions between tenofovir and rifampicin. In addition, Section 4.5 is further updated in regard of the interactions between tenofovir DF and lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir, as agreed for Viread at the time of the renewal. Section 2 and section 4 of the PL are also amended accordingly to the CHMP requests. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 24/01/2007   | 01/03/2007 | SmPC and PL              | A pharmacokinetic study performed in 24 healthy subjects which during 10 days received tenofovir DF 300 mg in combination with rifampicin 600 mg, once daily showed no clinically relevant interactions between these two drugs. Section 4.5 of the SPC reflects this information. This section was further update in regard to the interactions of tenofovir with lopinavir/ritonavir and with atazanavir/ritonavir in particular to stress the fact that higher concentrations of tenofovir could increase the potential for adverse reactions, including renal disorders. The PL was updated in section 2 and 4 in line with the above changes and with changes made to the Viread PL following the renewal. |

| II/0018 | Update of section 4.8 of the SPC and section 4 of the PL to include \"myopathy, osteomalacia (both in association with proximal renal tubulopathy)\" and \"acute interstitial nephririts\" in light of the cumulative review of renal events for tenofovir. The MAH has also taken this opportunity to amend the SPC, Annex II, labelling and the PL in line with the latest EMEA QRD template and to introduce minor linguistic changes to some EU languages, as relevant. In addition, the list of local representatives in some EU Member States were updated in section 6 of the PL. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet | 27/07/2006 | 28/08/2006 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | A review of the bone events in renal cases showed that 8 of the 12 cases with evidence for a positive tenofovir dechallenge included osteomalacia. In non-clinical studies tenofovir was already associated with osteomalacia in monkeys. Osteomalacia was recognised as an adverse reaction to tenofovir treatment but for which the frequency is currently not known. The muscle events in cases of possible fanconi syndrome were also reviewed: in 8 of the 15 cases describing muscle events, a positive dechallenge with clear improvement of the muscle symptoms was described. Myopathy is therefore an adverse reaction to tenofovir treatment for which the frequency is currently not known. A cumulative review of renal disorders lead to the inclusion of acute interstitial nephritis as an adverse reaction to tenofovir treatment. Section 4.8 of the SPC and section 4 of the PL were amended in accordance. |

| II/0013   | Update of section 4.8 of the SPC and section 4 of the PL, to reflect the results of 48-week data from three clinical studies evaluating emtricitabine in combination with other antiretroviral agents in HIV infected paediatric patients. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 23/02/2006   | 29/03/2006 | SmPC and PL | Safety results of three clinical studies conducted in HIV-1 infected children treated with emtricitabine in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products showed that anemia and skin discolouration (increased pigmentation) occurred more frequently in children compared to adults. This information is currently reflected in the emtricitabine product information - Emtriva, approved for use in children older than 4 months. Although Truvada, the fixed combination product of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) is not approved for use in children, this safety information has been included in section 4.8 of the SPC and in section 4 of the PL for Truvada. |

| II/0010 | Update of section 5.3 of the SPC to reflect the results of the one-month dog repeat dose toxicity study and the results of two in vitro genotoxicity studies as requested by the CHMP following the assessment of the in vitro final study reports. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics | 17/11/2005 | 23/12/2005 | SmPC | The 4 week repeat dose toxicity study in dogs investigating whether the combination treatment (emtricitabine/tenofovir DF) could enhance the renal toxicity observed with tenofovir DF alone revealed that the presence of emtricitabine did not enhance the toxicity of tenofovir DF. No exacerbation of the toxicological effects was found compared to the separate components. The mutagenicity of emtricitabine was previously found to be negative in a range of mutagenicity tests whilst tenofovir DF was positive in a number of in vitro genotoxicity assays. The two in vitro studies performed with combination emtricitabine/tenofovir DF which were assessed by the CHMP in June 2005 showed that Truvada displays mutagenicity in a mammalian mutagenesis assay comparable to that observed with tenofovir DF alone.

This is the 48 week follow-up of the pivotal GS-01-934 study supportive of the initial Marketing Authorisation for Truvada. The efficacy results showed superior antiviral activity of the tenofovir DF + emtricitabine arm compared with the lamivudine/zidovudine arm. No new or novel mutation associated with phenotypic resistance to either emtricitabine or tenofovir has developed. Section 5.1 was updated to reflect these results. The 48 week safety data are reassuring in terms of the safety profile of the combined use of tenofovir DF + emtricitabine. No new information has emerged concerning skin pigmentation or bone and renal toxicity and the   |

| II/0005   | Update of sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 of SPC and corresponding sections of PL further to CHMP request and additional safety data related to post-marketing experience of the individual components of Truvada, to ensure consistency. Minor linguistic changes were made in the SPC, Labelling or PL for some of the EU languages, as relevant. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet | 15/09/2005   | 25/10/2005   | SmPC, Labelling and PL | Further to the initial Marketing Authorisation of Truvada the safety information of the individual components (emtricitabine - Emtriva and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate - Viread) has been updated in view of post-marketing experience. The Truvada safety information is being updated in line with those changes. Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC include recommendations and warnings regarding co-administration of tenofovir and didanosine. Wording regarding laboratory markers of proximal tubulopathy has been incorporated into section 4.4. Nephritis and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus were included in the undesirable effects section as an outcome of the review of cumulative cases reported for Viread.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
