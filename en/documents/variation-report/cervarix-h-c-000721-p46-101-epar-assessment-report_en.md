## 1. Introduction

On 28 th  March 2024, the MAH submitted completed paediatric study for EPI-HPV-097 VE CN DB PMS (212381), entitled: 'An observational, database study to monitor cervical cancer-related endpoints in female subjects aged between 9 and 45 years in China prior to and following GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals' SA (GSK) Cervarix vaccine launch when Cervarix vaccine is administered according to the Local Prescribing Information (PI).'

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study 212381 (EPI-HPV-097 VE CN DB PMS) is a stand-alone study.

The MAH stated that Study 212381 is not part of any Paediatric Investigation Plan. An approved full waiver was obtained from Paediatric Committee (PDCO) for paediatric studies in EU.

As per the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA, former National Drug Administration of China [CNDA]) regulations, the MAH had to conduct an intensive drug monitoring (IDM) study following the launch of Cervarix in China. In addition, the Cervarix approval letter specified the following points: 'set up the follow-up register system following vaccination; collect related information on immune-mediated diseases, the effect on pregnancy outcome (including neonates' birth defect) and other serious diseases related to HPV infection'.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Cervarix is a recombinant C-terminally truncated HPV-16 L1 and HPV-18 L1 proteins, assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs) adjuvanted with the adjuvant AS04. The HPV 16 L1 VLP and HPV 18 L1 VLP proteins constitute the active ingredient of the vaccine and are produced with a recombinant baculovirus expression system. The AS04 adjuvant is composed of an aluminium salt, Al(OH)3 and 3O-desacyl- 4'-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL).

Cervarix is currently approved in the United States, all European Economic Area countries, the United Kingdom, Japan and in 67 other countries.

Cervarix is approved in the European Union (EU) since 20 September 2007 via the Centralized Procedure. Cervarix is indicated for use in Europe from the age of 9 years for the prevention of premalignant ano-genital lesions (cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal) and cervical and anal cancers causally related to certain oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types. A two dose (0.5 ml each) immunization schedule is recommended in children 9 to and including 14 years of age (the second dose is given between 5 and 13 months after the first dose) while a three dose (0.5 ml each) regimen is recommended in case of individuals from 15 years of age given at 0, 1, and 6 months.

In China, Cervarix was approved by National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in July 2016, for use in a 3-dose schedule at 0, 1, 6 months in females between 9 and 25 years of age, for the prevention of cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2, grade 3 (CIN 2/3) and adenocarcinoma in situ caused by high risk-human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) types 16 and 18. In May 2018, Cervarix was also approved for use in females up to 45 years of age.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Study number 212381 entitled: An observational, database study to monitor cervical cancer-related endpoints in female subjects aged between 9 and 45 years in China prior to and following GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals' SA (GSK) Cervarix vaccine launch when Cervarix vaccine is administered according to the Local Prescribing Information (PI).

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

An observational, database study to monitor cervical cancer-related endpoints in female subjects aged between 9 and 45 years in China prior to and following GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals' SA (GSK) Cervarix vaccine launch when Cervarix vaccine is administered according to the Local Prescribing Information (PI) (Study number 212381)

In addition to studies conducted outside of China, the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of Cervarix was also assessed in five clinical trials involving over 8000 Chinese females between 9 through 45 years of age. The results of the Phase 2/3 study (HPV-039) that assessed vaccine efficacy in more than 6000 women aged 18-25 years, showed high and sustained vaccine efficacy against all virological, cytological and histopathological efficacy endpoints associated with HPV-16/18. There was no sign of waning efficacy at the end of the study (up to Month 72). The Cervarix vaccine was generally well tolerated in Chinese women aged 18-25 years.

Study 212381 was designed to address the following NMPA's request to evaluate Cervarix impact in China: 'Set up the follow-up register system following vaccination and collect related information on immune mediated diseases, the effect on pregnancy outcome (including neonates birth defect, etc) and other serious diseases related to HPV infection.'

While the Phase 3 studies in China were conducted in clinical research settings, the purpose of such an observational study would be to monitor the real life effect of Cervarix on cervical cancer-related endpoints in the population in China.

To perform such evaluation, the Yinzhou Regional Health Information Platform (YRHIP) was identified by GSK following literature review, expert opinion, outsourced feasibility assessment and consultation meetings with local CDC in 2018. Yinzhou is a district in south of Shanghai, China. In 2016, Yinzhou had a total population of 1.24 million people, including 800 000 permanent residents. Since its creation, this database platform has been gradually expanding to cover all information sources, from information on public health surveillance, population screening, disease management, health information system in hospitals and other healthcare services and including HPV vaccinations (from October 2017 onwards). Since 2009, this regional system covers nearly all health-related activities of residents from birth to death. In 2018, more than 95% of permanent residents in Yinzhou were registered in the health information system with a valid healthcare identifier.

The aim of this study is to assess cervical cancer-related endpoints in female population following Cervarix vaccination in accordance to local PI using a sequential approach. In a first step, an assessment of YRHIP database performance for the detection of endpoints of interest (cervical HPV infection, cervical lesions such as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1), grade 2 (CIN2), CIN grade 3 (CIN3) and cervical cancer, with/without HPV type) based on pre-launch data will be performed. In the second step, baseline incidence rates of cervical cancer-related endpoints and vaccination rates will be computed. Cervical cancer screening practices during pre- and post-launch period will also be evaluated. Then, in a third step, the pre-and post-launch rates of the effectiveness

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

endpoints of interest will be assessed. Finally, provided that pre-defined criteria are met, the probability of occurrence of effectiveness endpoints of interest among vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects during post-launch period will be assessed. Comparative analysis for cervical cancer-related endpoints will be performed conditional upon a pre-defined number of subjects that have been vaccinated and screened in a reasonable period of time following vaccination during the study observation period.

This stepwise approach proposed for assessment of vaccine effect on cervical cancer-related endpoints was used to ensure mitigation of the limitations inherent to real-world evidence study. There were various limitations that may prevent hypothesis testing in this study including suboptimal rate of cervical screening (although according to CDC China, screening coverage for women aged 35 to 64 years, the targeted range of China's national screening program has raised overtime from about 25% in 2010, 27% in 2013, 31% in 2015, up to 37% in 2018-2019), unpredictable Cervarix uptake (an online cross-sectional survey of female students from 136 Chinese universities in 2019, only 11% of participants reported to have received the vaccine. A lower vaccination level [3.6% among females, 1.9% among males] was found in another survey among students in 2019) and the uncertain rates of cervical cancer-related endpoints. Therefore, the study aimed at assessing those factors and delivering rates of cervical cancer-related endpoints in vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts. The sequential approach developed in the current study enabled adaption of the study design based on the results generated in the initial steps e.g., case identification validation and prevalence rates.

## Methods

## Design of the study

This study was an observational database study to monitor the cervical cancer-related endpoints in female participants aged between 9 and 70 years in Yinzhou, China prior to and following Cervarix launch.

The overview of the study design is provided in Figure 1.

Pre-Cervarix launch period: 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2016 Post-Cervarix launch period: 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020l Note: Data was collected during the intermediate period for continuous monitoring.

Figure 1. Study design overview (Figure 6.1 CSR)

- Type of study and design: An observational database study (Retrospective cohort study design).
- General study aspects:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o Participant level data were retrieved from the database.
- o Study initiation date: 10 September 2021, Study completion date: 26 October 2023, End of study date: 26 October 2023, Data lock point (date of database freeze): 28 April 2023, Date of report: Final, 13 December 2023.
- o All subjects will be followed from the index date to the end of the study. Patients will be followed until death, last visit before loss to follow-up, or last visit prior to the end of the study period (December 31, 2020), whichever comes first.
- Study period:
- o Pre-Cervarix launch period: 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2016. First Cervarix doses were sold from July 2017 onwards in China and earlier elsewhere. This might bias slightly the pre-Cervarix launch area computation as potential vaccinated participants may be underestimated.
- o Post-Cervarix launch period: 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020.
- o For Cervarix vaccine uptake: From first Cervarix vaccination record to 31 December 2020.
- o Intermediate period: 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. This period was to ensure no over or under estimation in pre- and post-Cervarix launch period due to few vaccinated participants. As the number of HPV vaccinated participants in that period was negligible, this period was merged with the pre-Cervarix launch period.

Note: Cervarix was approved in China on 12 July 2016 and first available in 2017.

## Study population

The population-wide monitoring cohort for HPV vaccines included all female permanent residents aged 9-70 years in Yinzhou District, with immunization data included from the YRHIP.

Due to an administrative adjustment dividing Yinzhou District in 2016, the index date for patients who belonged to Yinzhou District before 2016 is the later date between their registration date in the YRHIP and January 1, 2010; and the index date for patients assigned to Yinzhou District after 2016, it is the later date between their registration date in the YRHIP and January 1, 2017.

Regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria, subjects should have ≥12 months of continuous registration in the YRHIP during the study period, defined by ≥2 observations recorded in YRHIP ≥12 months apart. Baseline period will be used to assess HPV status, using HPV screening results from pre-index date to earliest available data available.

## Data Sources

The Yinzhou District CDC has linked different administrative databases of general demographic characteristics, health check information, inpatient and outpatient EMRs, disease management, death certificates, and the immunization program. These databases are inherently linked to each other by a unique and encoded identifier for each individual. By end November 2018, the system integrated 33 hospitals in Yinzhou District, including 7 general hospitals, 2 specialized hospitals, 1 maternal and child health hospital, and 24 community health service centres/township health centres and 287 community health service stations. Another specific feature of this system is that all health-related outcomes, should they be diagnostic outcomes or procedures are coded in accordance to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Follow-up is continuous in the health information system meaning that update of important information such as vital status, clinical outcomes and claims data for all cohort members annually from the administrative databases is updated real time.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

* Cervical cancer-related endpoints of interest, defined as effectiveness endpoint e.g. cervical HPV infection, cervical lesions CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 or cervical cancer, for which case ascertainment and proper case counting in the database can be performed.

- To describe the prevalence of cervical cancer-related endpoints of interest with/without HPV type, among female participants aged 9 to 70 years screened as per local practice, overall and by vaccination status, by age, per calendar year during pre- and postCervarix launch period.

## Step 4: Conditional analysis (Secondary objectives)

- To assess the probability of occurrence of cervical cancer-related endpoints of interest with/without HPV type, among female participants aged 9 to 45 years, overall and by vaccination status, by age, per calendar year during pre- and postCervarix launch period conditional on vaccine uptake, cervical cancer screening examinations and observed prevalence within each of the compared study cohorts.

## Endpoints of the study

## Step 1:

- Occurrence of cervical cancer-related endpoints defined by ICD-10 codes, symptoms, diagnostic tests/procedures, prescriptions, and/or case narratives when available among female participants (aged 9 to 70 years per calendar year).

## Step 2:

- Occurrence of HPV infection, cervical lesions CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 and cervical cancer with/without HPV type.
- Number of participants with at least one dose of HPV vaccine administered, per type of vaccine and per number of administered doses.
- Occurrence of cervical cancer screening examinations.

## Step 3-4:

- Occurrence of cervical cancer-related endpoints of interest with/without HPV type.
- Occurrence of cervical cancer-related endpoints of interests with/without HPV type within screened population.

## Case definition

In this study for case identification, a list of ICD-10 codes will be used for the extraction. However, endpoint definitions in an electronic medical health records database can be a challenge. Therefore, case validation will be performed based on ICD-10 codes and a combination of disease terms in Chinese, examination, medications and/or procedures, as well as narratives, either alone or in combination to define outcomes of interest.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cervical cancer-related endpoints will include (amongst others):

- Cervical HPV infection defined as detection of HPV with or without genotype in the cervical sample - ICD-10 code R87.81
- Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 - ICD-10 code N87.0
- Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (i.e. moderate cervical dysplasia) - ICD-10 code N87.1
- Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (i.e. severe cervical dysplasia carcinoma in situ of cervix uteri) - ICD-10 code D06
- Cervical cancer (e.g. malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri) - ICD-10 code C53

Challenges in determining clearance or progressions of cervical cancer-related endpoints can be a potential limitation, and therefore cervical cancer-related endpoints of interest will be determined depending on case definition and frequencies based on ICD10 codes (above) or diagnostic test outcomes including HPV type (below).

## Cervical cancer screening / diagnostic procedures:

- HPV testing for high-risk HPV types for validation of HPV infection
- Conventional (Pap test) and liquid-based cytology for validation of CIN1, CIN2, CIN3
- Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) for validation of CIN1, CIN2, CIN3
- Histopathology of the uterine cervix in Colposcope for validation of CIN+
- Biopsy of uterine cervix for validation of CIN+

## Assessor's comment

The traditional method to screen women for cervical cancer has been cytology (the Papanicolaou test, also known as the Pap smear or smear test). When cytology results are positive, the diagnosis is confirmed by colposcopy, and appropriate treatment is informed by biopsy of suspicious lesions for histological diagnosis. Newer screening tests introduced in the last 15 years include visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), and molecular tests, mainly high-risk HPV DNA-based tests, which are suitable for use in all settings.

The potential cases of each endpoint in YRHIP database will be identify by the ICD-10-based algorithm. And their specific screening / diagnostic procedures will be retrieved directly from the database. If the total number of the cases identifying by the algorithm in the study is more than 200, and then 200 cases will be selected randomly to validate.

Judication process: According to the cervical cancer screening guidelines or China's clinical diagnostic standards, two relevant experts will review the anonymous histopathological results of subjects independently to confirm the diagnosis status (without the original diagnosis and blinded by vaccine history), any disagreements will be resolved by discussion with a third expert.

Assessment of identification Algorithms: Given the low prevalence of the cervical cancer related outcomes, in order to ensure the feasibility of judication, only the cases identified by ICD-10-based algorithms will be validated. Therefore, the positive predictive value (PPV) (together with exact 95% confidence interval [CI]) will be calculated for the determination of best algorithms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

|           | Total      | A+C                                              | B+D                                                    | A+B+C+ D |

Comparing with the results of adjudication committee as 'gold standards', a best performance of algorithm with PPV ≥ 70% at least will be applied to further analysis.

If PPV of the ICD-10-based algorithm is found to be low (&lt;70%), case identification method will be further fine-tuned to include, on top of ICD-10 codes, other data sources such as results of gynaecological examination, results of HPV examination, results of cytological examination, etc.

## Event and episode definition and counting rules:

An event is defined as an occurrence of an endpoint defined by ICD10 code in a subject. The event date is the date of diagnosis i.e. HPV testing results for HPV infections or histopathological results for CIN, cervical cancer; or, if this is not available, by medical diagnosis in ICD codes related to clinical status or disease.

For a given subject multiple records from various data sources will be merged and concatenated at subject level and the following definitions will apply as:

- One episode - based on temporal relationship and, if available, consistency of HPV testing i.e. the same HPV type(s). In case of progression from HPV infection to CIN1, CIN2, or from CIN1 to CIN2, etc. the events will be counted as an episode for respective endpoints with respective diagnosis date of such endpoint.
- New episode - if there is a proof of recovery from infection/ lesion/ cancer after last event; or if a new HPV type is identified. The start date of new episode is the date of diagnosis after recovery or date of new HPV type identification.
- The same episode - if not meeting criteria of a new episode.

## Statistical methods

## Sets for analyses

Total set included all eligible participants.

Vaccination Set included all female participants aged 9 to 45 years from the Total Set with at least one dose of any HPV vaccine received during the study period administered.

The Analysis Set for cervical cancer-related endpoints included all female participants aged 9 to 70 years from the Total Set during 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2020, who received no HPV vaccine (non-vaccinated) or who received at least one dose of Cervarix .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Analysis Screening Women Set for uptake included all female participants from the date first cervical cancer related screening from 1 January 2010, who received no HPV vaccine (non-vaccinated) or who received at least one dose of Cervarix . Currently, cervical cancer screening in Yinzhou includes female participants aged 9 to 70 years from governmental program or not governmental program.

## Analysis of the objectives

## Step 1: Assessment of database performance on cervical cancer-related endpoints (Total set)

Case identification method for cervical cancer-related endpoints (cervical HPV infection, cervical lesions CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 and cervical cancer, with/without HPV type) will be defined using ICD-10 codes available in YRHIP.

For cervical cancer-related endpoints (cervical HPV infection, cervical lesions CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 and cervical cancer, with/without HPV type), PPV of the case identification method will be assessed as follows:

- Case identification method for extraction of cervical cancer-related endpoints will make use of ICD-10 codes.
- For cervical cancer-related endpoints, performance of these ICD-10 based case identification method will be assessed against case identification method using other source data (Chinese disease terms, specify medications and/or examination, and/or procedures, and/or narratives), the latter being considered as a benchmark. In turn, PPV (together with exact 95% confidence interval [CI]) of the ICD-10 based case identification method will be computed. The proportion of confirmed cases (together with exact 95% CI) will be calculated as the number of confirmed cases divided by the total number of cases identified by case identification method.
- If performance of the ICD-10 based case identification method is found to be low, case identification method will be further fine-tuned to include, on top of ICD-10 codes, other data sources such as procedures, lab results, medication, etc.

## Step 2: Baseline analysis (Total set)

Annual background prevalence of cervical cancer-related endpoints during prelaunch period: For each cervical cancer-related endpoint, background prevalence (expressed as the number and the percentage of persons with exact 95% CI) during pre-launch period will be calculated among female subjects aged 9-70 years overall and by age, for each calendar year.

Annual vaccine uptake of Cervarix and other HPV vaccine(s): Vaccine uptake of Cervarix or other HPV vaccine(s) (expressed as number and the percentage of persons vaccinated with at least one dose of HPV vaccine, together with exact 95% CI) among female subjects aged 9-45 years will be calculated during postlaunch period. Vaccine uptake will be calculated, by vaccine type, per number of administered doses, by the age and overall, per calendar year.

Annual frequency of cervical cancer screening during pre- and post-launch period: Cervical cancer screening frequency and practices per screening program among female subjects aged 9-70 years will be tabulated, overall and by method, by age, for each calendar year during pre- and post-launch period.

Based on the above, the cervical cancer-related endpoints of interest will be defined.

## Step 3: Main analysis (Analysis set)

Annual prevalence of cervical cancer-related endpoints of interest per vaccination status during preand post-launch period: For cervical cancer-related endpoints of interest (based on pre-launch data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

analysis), prevalence (expressed as the proportion of cases, together with exact 95% CIs) during pre and post-launch period will be calculated among female subjects aged 9-70 years overall and separately by vaccination status (at least 1 dose of Cervarix vaccine versus no HPV vaccination, complete vaccination schedule vs no vaccination), by vaccine type, by age for each calendar year.

Annual prevalence of cervical cancer-related endpoints of interest during pre- and post-launch period among female subjects screened for HPV: For cervical cancer-related endpoints of interest (based on pre-launch data analysis), prevalence (expressed as the proportion of cases, together with exact 95% CIs) during pre- and post-launch period will be calculated among female subjects aged 9-70 years who were screened for HPV as per local practice, overall and by vaccination status (at least one dose of Cervarix vaccine versus no HPV vaccination), by vaccine type, by age for each calendar year.

## Step 4: Conditional analysis (Analysis set)

Conditional on a minimum number of vaccinated subjects and observed prevalence of cervical cancerrelated endpoints, the probability of cervical cancer-related endpoints of intertest may be assessed in the age cohorts where vaccination uptake together with endpoints assessment occurred and/or prevalence of cervical cancer-related endpoint is the highest.

The probability of cervical cancer-related endpoints may be compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects using a Poisson regression adjusted for age and other possible covariates (e.g. calendar year).

The probability of cervical cancer-related endpoints amongst screened women may be compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects, using a Poisson regression adjusted for age and other possible covariates (e.g. calendar year).

## Interpretation of analyses

The study is descriptive, and no hypothesis testing will be performed.

## Assessor's comment

## Cervical cancer screening / diagnostic procedures

Women with Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade CIN2 and CIN3 are at high risk for developing invasive cancer, although the average time for progression is still several years. Therefore, women with CIN2/3 should receive treatment. Exceptions to this recommendation are women in the 20 to 24 year age group and pregnant women.

Since a certain percentage of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSIL) on pap smear will have CIN2 or 3, it makes sense that these pap smears still require colposcopy and biopsy in most cases. The same holds for older women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) pap smears who also have a high-risk HPV.

Cytology is the screening test, but histologic characteristics of a tissue biopsy make the diagnosis. Colposcopy with directed biopsy is the preferred method for evaluation of an abnormal pap smear result. \"Co-testing\" combines cytology and HPV testing for high-risk types, but is still considered screening.

If suspicious lesions are identified during colposcopy, a biopsy may be performed. A small tissue sample is collected from the affected area for further examination during a cervical biopsy. The biopsy results can confirm and validate the presence and grade of CIN of suggestive cellular and histological signs via direct examination. Therefore, the diagnosis of CIN lesions ultimately requires biopsy of the uterine cervix with tissue sampling.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Any prevalence estimates for CIN lesions need to be based on tissue sampling performed under colposcopy with directed biopsy. Case ascertainment/validation based on other types of methods such as HPV testing or Pap smear is not appropriate.

In this study, the cervical cancer diagnostic procedures to validate CIN1/2/3 will include conventional (pap test), liquid-based cytology, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) or histopathology of the uterine cervix by colposcopy. The limitations in the availability of appropriate diagnostic tools for detection and characterization of HPV-related infection and CIN lesions may have an impact on outcome identification. The limitations in the case validation/ascertainment process may as well suffer of appropriate case validation for HPV-related infection and CIN lesions. Hence, the estimates of the cervical cancer-related endpoints of interest could be underestimated and/or must be interpreted with caution.

Other important limitations are the suboptimal rate of cervical screening (China achieved national coverage of 36.8% in the year 2018-2019). Also, lack of completeness or inefficiencies in the correct identification of vaccination status could happen.

## Assessor's comment

## Number of vaccinated subjects

The total number of vaccinated female participants, aged between 9 and 70 yoa, with at least one dose of Cervarix was 3507. The total number of vaccinated that received the first dose, the second dose and the third dose of Cervarix in the Yinzhou district were 3461, 2136 and 1281 respectively. The total number of vaccinated participants that received the first dose of Cervarix in the Yinzhou district (n=3461) is slightly smaller than the total number of participants vaccinated with at least one dose of Cervarix (n=3507) because some participants may have received their first dose of Cervarix in another geographic area, and be included in the study. Of these participants 843 were vaccinated by 2018, 2048 by 2019 and 3507 by 2020.

## Vaccine uptake

The vaccine uptake was 10.59 per 1000 for Cervarix (at least 1 dose) for the pooled age group of 9 to 45 years and cumulative of the year 2018-2020. Vaccine uptake since 2018 has increased up to 2020 with  2.02 for 2018, 3.56 for 2019 and 4.31 for 2020.

This vaccine uptake is lower than the already low HPV vaccination rate in China (24%). This constitutes a significant limitation of this retrospective observational study. In order to reach an adequate sample size for robust estimates, it is expected that more than 3 years follow-up period foreseen in the study design will be needed. Indeed, the overall assessment showed that given the current vaccine coverage for Cervarix , attaining the adequate sample size for vaccine effectiveness calculation would demand a considerable amount of time, and this may constitute a significant limitation of the study 1 .

The MAH also mentioned a possible lack of completeness or inefficiencies in the correct identification of vaccination status may have happened, and limit the study result interpretation.

Although it would have been valuable to continue monitoring cervical HPV-related diseases and cancer in the YRHIP database, the MAH is not planning it. This is because of insufficient number of Cervarixvaccinated participants and consequently insufficient statistical power cannot be achieved as to assess the outcomes of interest.

## Screening rates and rates of detection of HPV infections

Between 2010 and 2020, a total 59699 female subjects were screened for HPV, representing 8.6% of the Total set. Most of them (40576) tested using HPV testing for high-risk HPV types and using Pap test and liquid based cytology (29 306). Only 1700 participants were tested using biopsy, 522 participants were tested using visual inspection with acetic acid, 185 participants were tested using cervicoscope, 566 participants were tested using colposcopy and 4284 participants were tested using histopathology of the uterine cervix.

The total number of vaccinated with at least one dose of Cervarix that underwent screening methods was 1054 on a total of 3507 (30%) vaccinated subjects with at least one dose. The total number of unvaccinated that underwent screening methods was 55 583 with a screening rate less than 10% which differs from the vaccinated set. The differences in overall screening rates between the vaccinated versus unvaccinated set is a limitation of this study. This is probably due to the higher awareness of the importance of screening in the vaccinated set. Of note, according to the CSR, China achieved overall national screening coverage of 36.8% in the year 2018-2019. The suboptimal rate of cervical screening is an important limitation of this study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The screening detection rate for any types of HPV infections in the vaccinated set vs the unvaccinated set was different with a higher rate in the vaccinated set (278.76 vs 182.13 for the post-Cervarix launch period 2018-2020, refer to CSR Table 14.2.2.7). This was also observed for the detection rate of CIN1 and to a minor extent for CIN2 and CIN3 (refer to CSR tables 11.9, 11.10 and 11.11). This suggests that the vaccinated set had a different seeking behavior for screening than the unvaccinated and might be explained by better awareness of the importance of screening.

## Screening performance for CIN lesions

There are limitations related to the availability of appropriate diagnostic tools for the detection and the characterization of CIN lesions that may have had an impact on outcome validation of CIN lesions. Indeed, only tissue sampling of the cervix by colposcopy or cervicoscopy with microscopic preparation for histopathology examination can validate/confirm CIN lesions and their grade. HPV testing and Pap smear cannot confirm or validate CIN lesions. Case ascertainment for CIN lesions using these screening results is not considered a valid diagnostic tool but only a screening method. Hence, the suboptimal rate of appropriate diagnostic procedures is an important limitation of this study.

Furthermore, all the cervical cancer screening methods mentioned in the protocol (including HPV testing and Pap tests) were not part of governmental screening program in the specific region district that was investigated which is an important limitation as this could lead to underestimates of the prevalences in the vaccinated as well as the unvaccinated sets related to financial constraints of the subjects. Biopsy sampling rate via colposcopy within the screening set (and/or to a minor extent during cervicoscopy) was very low (&lt;0.1%).

Therefore, the values of the cervical cancer related endpoints of interests must be interpreted with caution and cannot provide reliable conclusions.

## Assessor's comment

Mean age of participants included in the Vaccination set (24.8 [SD 8.2]) was lower than mean age of Total set (38.6 [SD 14.4]), Screening set (36.5 [SD 10.1]) and Cervical cancer-related endpoints set (40.6 [SD 11.7]).

Similarly the mean age of event of participants included in the Vaccination set (31.5 [SD 7.1]) was lower than mean age of Screening set (41.9 [SD 10.1]) and Cervical cancer-related endpoints set (46.5 [SD 11.6]).

The vaccinated set had a lower marital status and a higher education background when compared to screening set. Thus, the vaccinated set seems to be quiet different when compared to the screening set, any result comparisons will need to be interpreted with caution. In addition, demographics correspond to the whole vaccinated set, i.e. not restricted to the Cervarix vaccinated set.

According to Table 1, only 4 % of the Cervarix vaccinated participants were dosed between 9-17 years of age. Around 11% of the vaccinated participants were dosed between 18-24 years of age, 13% between 25-29 years of age and 27% between 30-34 and 35-39 years of age. Around 19% of the vaccinated participants were dosed between 40-45 years of age.

Event was diagnosed in only 1.1% of the 9-17 years of age of the vaccinated participants, while around 20-25% of events were diagnosed in each age category of 25-29, 30-34, 35-39 years of age. Around 15% of events were diagnosed in the 40-45 years of age category. Less than 1% of the events were diagnosed between age of 46-70 years.

Only 1.6% of the participants of the screening set were 9-17 years of age, 10% were 18-24 years of age and around 16-19% were in of each age category of 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-45 years of age.

HPV infections : 711.74 vs 311.99 in 2018, 1171.88 vs 373.17 in 2019 and 1796.41 vs 681.08 in 2020

CIN1 : 237.25 vs 66.99 in 2018, 146.48 vs 67.98 in 2019 and 285.14 vs 69.12 in 2020

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia results from HPV infection within cervical cells. These changes, especially in young women, commonly revert to normal cells due to an intact immune response and rapid turnover of cells on the cervix. About 60% of CIN1 will regress to normal after 1 year. The time interval between the acquisition of HPV infection and progression to CIN2/CIN3 and invasive carcinoma may take several years.

Surprisingly in this study, overall, the data revealed a higher prevalence in the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated individuals for HPV infection, CIN1, CIN2 and CIN3. Results show an apparent higher prevalence in HPV infections and CIN1 lesions for the vaccinated cohort compared to the unvaccinated population between 2018 and 2020. No cases were reported for CIN2/CIN3 and ICC for the year 2018 but higher prevalences were observed for CIN2 and CIN3 for the vaccinated cohort compared to the unvaccinated population in the years 2019 and 2020. No cases were reported for ICC in the vaccinated individuals between 2018 and 2020.

There were no cases of CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 and cervical cancer with HPV-16 and HPV-18 types in the vaccinated individuals during the post-Cervarix launch period. Cases of CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 and cervical cancer with HPV-16 and HPV-18 types were detected only in a very low number of non-vaccinated participants (&lt;10 and &lt;5 per year for HPV-16 and HPV-18 type, respectively).

Overall, the prevalence in the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohort was very low for the HPV infections and overall CIN lesions suggesting that the registry database has significant limitations (case ascertainment related) and/or that the screening rates were insufficient at the time of the study. Moreover, the study design covered only a 3 year period post-launch of Cervarix vaccination. Therefore, the follow-up period of this study was insufficient to detect a measurable impact of the vaccination on cervical cancer-related endpoints of interest on this specific population.

These limitations imply caution in the interpretation of the prevalence observed for the cervical cancer related endpoints of interests in the vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals. No conclusions can be made on the data observed.

## Results of secondary objectives

Algorithm 4 output of each HPV infection type after inclusion date among the Total set.

Algorithm 4 identified confirmed cases of each HPV type infection in the Yinzhou database, and the higher prevalence was seen for HPV-52 (n=946), 58 (n=561) and 16 (n=497) type.

Note: Note: Algorithm 1 consisted of Chinese terms, Algorithm 2 was ICD-10 codes, Algorithm 3 was Algorithm 1 or 2 and Algorithm 4 consisted of the result of HPV testing.

* In this study, we found that very few diagnoses involving HPV infection included genotyping results. Therefore, we used the result of HPV testing to identify the genotype of HPV infection. In this case, because the algorithm we use to determine genotype is the reference that we chose to determine the confirmed cases (for example, the specific HPV test such as HPV-16, and their result shown as \"positive (F日 性)\" or \"+\" or \"virus load &gt; 500\") in the protocol (the reference source against which we confirm as true case the data extracted by the algorithms).

## Algorithm's performance validation of other cervical cancer related diseases after inclusion date among the Total set.

Based on the algorithm's performance, algorithm 3 or manual check confirmed cases of algorithm 4 was used as the final algorithms.

The PPV of final algorithms was 99.41%, 89.47%, 79.26%, 85.88% and 78.18% for HPV infection, CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 and cervical cancer, respectively.

Note: Algorithm 4 consisted of the result of HPV testing.

## Occurrence of cervical cancer related endpoints identified by different algorithms.

The number of occurrences amongst different age groups increased over the period of 10 years, from 2010 to 2020 for the pooled age group 9 to 70 years.

Final algorithm (algorithm 3+manual check confirmed cases of algorithm 4) identified 174 occurrences in the year 2010 which increased to 4014 occurrences in the year 2020.

## Occurrence of cervical cancer related endpoints with/without HPV type within screened population identified by different algorithms.

The number of occurrences increased over the period of 10 years, from 2010 to 2020 for the pooled age group 9 to 70 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Final algorithm (algorithm 3 + manual check confirmed cases of algorithm 4) identified 93 occurrences in the year 2010 which increased to 3025 occurrences in the year 2020.

## Vaccine uptake rate and time interval during two adjacent vaccinations during 2018 to 2020 for different vaccines.

Vaccine uptake was 10.59 per 1000 for Cervarix for the pooled age group of 9 to 45 years and cumulative of the year 2018-2020, 2.02 for 2018, 3.56 for 2019 and 4.31 for 2020.

Also refer to participant disposition.

## Prevalence of cervical cancer screening item by program, per calendar year by age strata, and overall

The prevalence of cervical cancer screening item tested using HPV testing, Pap test and liquid-based cytology, Cervicoscope, Colposcopy, Visual inspection with acetic acid, Biopsy and Histopathology are presented in Table 1.9 and Table 1.10 of the CSR.

Also refer to participant disposition.

## Prevalence and prevalence ratio of cervical cancer related endpoints in vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts.

The conditional analysis is not conducted for the study, as the sample size required to conduct the conditional analysis was not met. As per the sample size calculation the required sample size was supposed to be 1955 participants. However, the actual sample size for the study included 1793 participants which was lower than the required sample size to conduct a sound statistically powered analysis, hence the conditional analysis was not performed.

## Assessor's comment

The sample size required to conduct the conditional analysis was not met. The prevalence ratio of cervical cancer related endpoints in vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts was not calculated. The required sample size was supposed to be 1955 participants. The number of 1955 was justified in the SAP to give estimates of vaccine effectiveness with 80% statistical power. However, because of the many limitations of the study, including the low uptake of Cervarix and the sub-optimal detection of cervical cancer related disease, this issue is not pursued for the limited period of follow-up postCervarix launch from 2018 to 2020.

Also refer to assessments above.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Cervarix was approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in July 2016, for use in a 3-dose schedule at 0, 1, 6 months in females between 9 and 25 years of age, for the prevention of cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1)grade 2 (CIN2), grade 3 (CIN3) and adenocarcinoma in situ caused by high risk-human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) types 16 and 18. In May 2018, Cervarix was also approved for use in females up to 45 years of age. First Cervarix doses were sold from July 2017 onwards in China.

Study 212381 is an observational, database study to monitor cervical cancer-related endpoints in female subjects aged between 9 and 45 years in China prior to and following Cervarix vaccine launch when Cervarix vaccine is administered according to the Local Prescribing Information. This study was requested by the Chinese authorities and was conducted based on the recent YRHIP population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

databased registry in the Chinese district Yinzhou with a population of more than one million inhabitants.

The study was initiated the 10 September 2021 and terminated on 26 October 2023. The main aim of this retrospective observational, registry database, study was to assess cervical cancer-related endpoints of interest (in terms of cervical HPV infection, cervical lesions CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 or cervical cancer) in female subjects aged between 9 and 70 years in China during the preCervarix launch period (1 January 2010 to 31 December 2016) and postCervarix launch period (1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020). The study design used a sequential approach comprising 4 steps :

1. Assessment of Yinzhou Regional Health Information Platform (YRHIP) database performance for the detection of endpoints of interest (cervical HPV infection, cervical lesions such as CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 and cervical cancer, with/without HPV type) based on preCervarix launch data.
2. Computation of baseline prevalence of cervical cancer-related endpoints and vaccination rates. Evaluation of cervical cancer screening practices during pre- and postCervarix launch period.
3. Assessment of the pre-and postCervarix launch rates of the effectiveness endpoints of interest. This was the main analysis and primary objective.
4. Upon pre-defined criteria are met, assessment of the probability of occurrence of effectiveness endpoints of interest among vaccinated and unvaccinated participants during postCervarix launch period.

A total of 691 322 eligible participants were included in the Total set. A total 59 699 were screened for HPV, representing 8.6% of the Total set. Most of them (40 576) tested using HPV testing for high-risk HPV types and using Pap test and liquid based cytology (29 306).  Only 1700 participants were tested using biopsy, including only 566 participants using colposcopy, which is required for final diagnosis of CIN lesions. An additional 522 participants were tested using visual inspection with acetic acid, 185 participants were tested using cervicoscope, and 4284 participants were tested using histopathology exam of the cervix.

The total number of vaccinated female participants, aged between 9 and 70 yoa, with at least one dose of Cervarix was 3507.

The vaccine uptake rate was 10.59 per 1000 for Cervarix (at least 1 dose) for the pooled age group of 9 to 45 years and cumulative of the year 2018-2020. This vaccine uptake is lower than the already low HPV vaccination rate in China (24%). Only 4 % of the Cervarix vaccinated participants were dosed between 9-17 years of age.

The total number of vaccinated with at least one dose of Cervarix that underwent screening methods was 1054, representing 30% of the Cervarix vaccinated individuals. The total number of nonvaccinated with at least one dose of Cervarix that underwent screening methods was 55 583, i.e. 10% of the non-vaccinated set. The overall screening rate is lower than the overall national screening coverage of 36.8% achieved in the year 2018-2019 in China.

During the post-Cervarix launch period (2018-2020), an overall higher prevalence (per 100 000) in HPV infection, CIN1, CIN2 and CIN3 for the vaccinated cohort (i.e. vaccinated with at least one dose of Cervarix administered from 9 up to 45 years of age) compared to the unvaccinated population was observed. Prevalences were for:

- HPV infections : 711.74 vs 311.99 in 2018, 1171.88 vs 373.17 in 2019 and 1796.41 vs 681.08 in 2020
- CIN1 : 237. 25 vs 66.99 in 2018, 146.48 vs 67.98 in 2019 and 285.14 vs 69.12 in 2020

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- CIN2 : 0 vs 30.76 in 2018, 146.48 vs 34.51 in 2019 and 114.06 vs 31.72 in 2020
- CIN3 : 0 vs 23.59 in 2018, 48.83 vs 30.77 in 2019, 28.51 vs 28.78 in 2020

There were no cases of ICC in the Cervarix vaccinated individuals during the 2018-2020 period.

Noteworthy, there were no cases of CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 and cervical cancer with HPV-16 and HPV-18 types in the vaccinated individuals. However, cases of CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 and cervical cancer with HPV16 and HPV-18 types were detected only in a very low number of non-vaccinated participants (&lt;10 and &lt;5 per year for HPV-16 and HPV-18 type, respectively).

This unexpected higher prevalence in HPV infections among the vaccinated population might be due to different factors such as the limited vaccine coverage, limited screening rate, limitations in the availability of appropriate diagnostic tools for detection and characterization of HPV-related infection and diseases, potential incorrect vaccination status, and limited study period post-Cervarix launch. In addition, most of the vaccinated women were dosed after 18 years of age. Vaccine efficacy is higher in HPV naïve women (i.e., before the sexual debut because the current paradigm of HPV acquisition is sexual activity), and declines with age at first vaccination assuming that the older the woman is more likely to have been exposed to HPV.

Additional factors such as health care seeking behaviour (both for vaccination and HPV screening) have potentially biased the results.

All these limitations imply caution in the interpretation of the prevalences observed for the cervical cancer related endpoints of interests in the vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. No conclusions can be made on the data observed.

The MAH is not planning to continue monitoring cervical HPV-related diseases and cancer in the YRHIP database due to insufficient number of Cervarix-vaccinated participants and consequently insufficient statistical power cannot be achieved as to assess the outcomes of interest.

Because of the many limitations of the study, it is agreed with the MAH that results of study 212381 do not impact the PI for Cervarix and no update of the SmPC is needed.

## 3. Request for supplementary information

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure:

## Question 1

The different values provided regarding the number of vaccinated individuals with Cervarix are not consistent. The Applicant should clarify how many female subjects were vaccinated with Cervarix for each year (2018 to 2020) with the number of doses in the given year.

## Question 2

It is requested to the MAH to communicate the further planned monitoring of the occurrences in cervical cancer related endpoints of interests and surveillance of vaccine effect on prevention of HPVrelated disease in China using real-world data from YRHIP database.

The timetable is a 30 day response timetable without clock stop.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## MAH responses to Request for supplementary information

## Question 1

The different values provided regarding the number of vaccinated individuals with Cervarix are not consistent. The Applicant should clarify how many female subjects were vaccinated with Cervarix for each year (2018 to 2020) with the number of doses in the given year.

## Applicant answer

The Company would like to clarify the different numbers of vaccinated subjects in the Clinical Study Report (CSR) questioned by the assessors in their comments in the assessment report.

Assessor comment 1: In Figure 11.1 Participants Disposition (given below) (p. 107 of CSR) the total number of vaccinated with at least one dose of Cervarix was N =3507. The total number of vaccinated that received one dose, 2 doses and 3 doses were N=3461, N=2136 and, N=1281 respectively.

Company answer 1: In the Participants Disposition flowchart (Figure 11.1), the text box that includes 'Cervarix N=3507' participants corresponds to the total number of participants in the dataset that received at least one dose of Cervarix. The correct interpretation of the text box which includes 'Cervarix first dose (N=3461); second dose (N=2136); third dose (N=1281)' is the first dose, second dose, and third dose respectively, and not 'one dose, second dose, or third dose'. These data are consistent with the participants that received their first, second, or third dose of Cervarix in the Yinzhou district and hence, registered in the database as having received the vaccine in the Yinzhou area. Some participants may have received their first dose of Cervarix in another geographic area. Therefore, the total number of participants vaccinated with at least one dose of Cervarix was N =3507, while the total number of vaccinated participants that received the first dose of Cervarix in the Yinzhou district was slightly smaller , i.e., N= 3461.

Assessor comment 2: In Table 1.5, total number of vaccinated with at least one dose of Cervarix in the female population aged between 9 and 70 yoa was N=843, N=2048, and N=3507 in the given year 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

Company answer 2: In Table 1.5, the number represents the cumulative total of participants vaccinated up to that year. For example, N=3507 for the year 2020 refers to the fact that 3507 participants had been vaccinated by 2020, not that all 3507 participants were vaccinated in 2020. Similarly, N=2048 for 2019 means that 2048 participants had been vaccinated by 2019, and 843 participants were vaccinated by 2018.

Assessor comment 3: According to Template 16 p. 477 of the CSR, a total of N=853, N=1496, and N=1793 individuals had been vaccinated with Cervarix in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

Company answer 3: Template 16 displays the total number of participants vaccinated in every calendar year, as opposed to Table 1.5 that represents the cumulative number of participants vaccinated up to every calendar year. However, as the purpose of the feasibility assessment was to roughly determine the possibility to conduct the conditional analysis with sufficient statistical power, the Company did not limit the age or gender of the participants when extracting the data for this purpose. Therefore, Template 16 may also contain males or people beyond the 9-70 years of age group, who are not subject of the study. Additionally, participants can be counted multiple times. The numbers shown for every calendar year correspond to people who received the vaccine in each calendar year. However, a participant may have been vaccinated multiple times (multiple doses) in different years, and therefore can be repeatedly counted. For these reasons, the numbers in Template 16 are not aligned with those displayed in the Participants disposition flowchart, or in Table 1.5.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rapporteur's assessment

The MAH clarified the different number of vaccinated subjects (first, second and third dose) presented in Figure 11.1, Table 1.5 and Template 16 as requested.

Issue resolved.

## Question 2

It is requested to the MAH to communicate the further planned monitoring of the occurrences in cervical cancer related endpoints of interests and surveillance of vaccine effect on prevention of HPVrelated disease in China using real-world data from YRHIP database.

## Applicant answer

As the Cervarix vaccination coverage in the area was not expected to increase since this analysis' latest timepoint (2020) until today and in the future due to the presence of several HPV vaccines on the Chinese market, sufficient number of Cervarix-vaccinated participants and consequently sufficient statistical power cannot be achieved as to assess the outcomes of interest. the company is not planning to continue monitoring cervical HPV-related diseases and cancer in the YRHIP database.

Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of Cervarix in China has been demonstrated in clinical trials involving over 8000 Chinese females between 9 through 45 years of age [Zhu, 2011; Zhu, 2014a, Zhu, 2014b; Zhu, 2017; Zhu, 2019] showing high and sustained vaccine efficacy against all virological, cytological, and histopathological efficacy endpoints associated with HPV-16/18. Cervarix vaccine was generally well tolerated in Chinese women aged 18-25 years [Zhu, 2019]. A ten-year follow-up Cervarix study of 6051 women aged 18-25 years at vaccination in China, unveiled a vaccine efficacy against incident HPV-16/18 infection and CIN2+ of 80.8% (95%CI, 72.4%-87.0%), and 90.5% (95%CI, 34.6%-99.8%), respectively [Zhao, 2023], adding evidence of the long-term protection of Cervarix against advanced premalignant cervical lesions and cancer.

Additionally, relevant data are becoming available from long-term follow-up observational studies and surveillance of implementation of Cervarix in National Immunisation Programmes worldwide. For instance, a recent publication from Scotland showed that there were no cases of invasive cancer recorded in females vaccinated with Cervarix at 12 or 13 years of age irrespective of the number of doses [Palmer, 2024]. Similarly in England, data from a total of 13·7 million-years of follow-up of females aged 20 years to younger than 30 years unveiled a reduction of cervical cancer of 87% (95% CI, 72%-94%) for adolescents vaccinated with Cervarix at age 12-13 years, compared with the reference unvaccinated cohort [Falcaro, 2021]. In the Netherlands, ten years post-vaccination with Cervarix of girls 13-16 years of age, vaccine effectiveness against 12-month persistent infection with vaccine types (HPV16/18) was 95.8% (95%CI, 86.6%-98.7%). Cross-protective 12-month persistent infection (HPV31/33/45) vaccine effectiveness was 64.6% (95%CI, 37.6%-79.9%). There were no indications of waning of protection over time [Hoes, 2023]. Therefore, there is sound evidence of longterm high vaccine effectiveness of Cervarix.

## Rapporteur's assessment

The MAH is not planning to continue monitoring cervical HPV-related diseases and cancer in the YRHIP database due to sufficient number of Cervarix-vaccinated participants and consequently insufficient statistical power cannot be achieved as to assess the outcomes of interest.

This is acknowledged.

## 4. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

Taking into account all the significant and potential limitations, the databased registry results of this study imply caution in the interpretation of the findings and preclude any robust conclusions. No changes to the SmPC for Cervarix are considered necessary.

## Fulfilled:

No regulatory action required.
