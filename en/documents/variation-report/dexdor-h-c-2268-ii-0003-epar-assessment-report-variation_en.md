## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Introduction

Dexmedetomidine (Dexdor) is a selective alpha-2 receptor agonist with a broad range of pharmacological  properties.  It  has  a  sympatholytic  effect  through  decrease  of  the  release  of noradrenaline  in  sympathetic  nerve  endings.  The  sedative  effects  are  mediated  through  decreased firing of locus coeruleus, the predominant  noradrenergic nucleus, situated in the brainstem. Dexmedetomidine has analgesic and anaesthetic/analgesic-sparing effects. The cardiovascular effects depend on the dose; with lower infusion rates the central effects dominate leading to decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. With higher doses, peripheral vasoconstricting effects prevail leading to an increase  in  systemic  vascular  resistance  and  blood  pressure,  while  the  bradycardic  effect  is  further emphasised. Dexmedetomidine is relatively free from respiratory depressive effects.

Dexdor is indicated for the sedation of adult ICU (Intensive Care Unit) patients requiring a sedation level not deeper than arousal in response to verbal stimulation (corresponding to Richmond AgitationSedation Scale (RASS) 0 to -3). It is presented as 100 μg /ml concentrate for solution for infusion. The recommended dose is an initial infusion  rate  of  0.7 μg  /kg/h  which  may  then  be  adjusted  stepwise within the dose range 0.2 to 1.4 μg /kg/h in order to achieve the desired level of sedation.

This variation refers to an update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC to revise the paediatric information based on the results of new paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of the  Paediatric  Regulation.  Linguistic  changes  are  made  in  the  following  countries:  Greece,  France, Italy, Czech Republic.

## 1.2. Clinical aspects

The  limited  paediatric  information  reflected  in  the  current  SmPC  (sections  4.2,  4.8,  5.1  and  5.2)  is based on the following studies, previously submitted at the time of the initial marketing authorisation (MAA):

-W98-266 : a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study in 36 subjects aged 2-12 years who received 2- 6 μg/kg/hr dexmedetomidine for 10 minutes pre-operatively;

-2004-5-3770 : a PK/PD study in 38 subjects aged 1 month to 2 years who received a loading dose then maintenance doses of dexmedetomidine 0.25- 0.75 μg/kg/hr for up to 24 hours in the paediatric ICU;

-DEX-08-01 : a phase II study of safety and efficacy in 59 ICU subjects aged between 2 and 17 years who received dexmedetomidine 0.2-2 μg/kg/hr (plus loading dose) for up to 24 hours.

It is known from the previously submitted data that dexmedetomidine exposure in children 2.3 to 11.5 years of age appeared to be somewhat lower than in adults receiving the same body weight-adjusted regimen as a result of higher body weight-adjusted clearance in children. In Study W98-266 a single i.v.  dose  of  dexmedetomidine  was  administered  to  36  children  across  three  dosing  groups  for  10 minutes:  2.0  µg/kg/h  Group  I;  4.0  µg/kg/h  Group  II;  and  6.0  µg/kg/h  Group  III.  Pharmacokinetic results are presented in Table 1:

However, data from studies with children less than 2 years are not consistent. In one study where dexmedetomidine  was  administered  to  post-operative,  cardiac  surgical  infants  (aged  1  month  to  2 years)  no  apparent  change  in  clearance  and  weight-adjusted  clearance  across  the  age  range  was observed (Study 2004-5-3770). In that study dexmedetomidine body weight-adjusted clearance values in  infants  were  also  higher  than  those  reported  in  adults.  Data  from  a  third  study  suggests  that children  younger  than  one  year  of  age  might  have  lower  bodyweight-adjusted  clearances  when compared to older children and adults (Potts AL et al., 2009, Potts AL et al., 2008) implying that higher steady-state dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations would be predicted when dosing in proportion to bodyweight.

Within  this  variation  application,  3  new  paediatric  studies  are  being  submitted  in  accordance  with article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation and are as follows:

- -DEX-11-01 : A PK/PD study in 5 paediatric subjects aged 12-24 months, treated at 2 dose levels up to 0.75 μg/kg/hr for up to 24 hours in the ICU.
- -DEX-09-08 : A PK/PD study in neonates in the ICU patients. 36 patients were enrolled from 28-44 weeks gestational age to receive a loading dose then dexmedetomidine 0.05-0.2 μg/kg/hr for up to 24 hours;
- -DEX-08-05 : A phase III study of efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine in 175 subjects in the ICU aged  1  month  to  17  years,  who  received  an  optional  loading  dose  then  dexmedetomidine  0.2-1.4 μg/kg/hr for up to 24 hours;

The CHMP also noted that the remaining paediatric data to be submitted relate to the final Pre-term group (6 subjects) from the DEX-09-08 study which will now be collected as a separate study. This study is in the set-up phase and results are not expected before the end of 2012.

## 1.2.1. Study DEX-11-01

This  was  a  phase  II,  randomized,  open-label,  single  centre,  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic study of dexmedetomidine in paediatric subjects aged 12 months to &lt; 24 months. The objectives were: 1)  To  define  the  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  profile  of  dexmedetomidine  (DEX)  administered  as  an intravenous (IV) loading dose followed by a continuous IV infusion in paediatric subjects; 2) To define the pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of DEX administered as an IV loading dose followed by a continuous IV infusion in paediatric subjects

The study design is summarised in Figure 1.

## 1.2.1.1. Methodology

## Study participants

## Inclusion criteria

These  were  as  follows:  1)  Initially  intubated  and  mechanically  ventilated  paediatric  subjects  ( ≥ 12 months    to  &lt;24  months)  in  an  intensive  care  setting.  The  subject  must  have  been  mechanically ventilated prior to and during the commencement of study drug; 2) Anticipated to require a minimum of  6  hours  of  continuous IV sedation and 3) Subject had adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine ≤ 1.0 mg/dL

## Exclusion criteria

These were as follows: 1) Paediatric subjects with neurological conditions that prohibited an evaluation of  sedation  (e.g  diminished  consciousness  from  increased  intracranial  pressure,  extensive  brain surgery  requiring  intracranial pressure  monitor),  diminished  cognitive  function  per  investigator discretion; subjects with immobility from neuromuscular disease or continuous infusion of neuromuscular  blocking (NMB) agents); 2) Subjects with second degree or third degree heart block unless  the  subject  had  a  permanent  pacemaker  or  pacing  wires  were  in  situ;  3)  Subjects  who  had hepatic impairment as defined by a serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)/ alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 90 U/L at the time of screening;  4) Subjects who had hypotension, based on  repeat  assessments  within  15  minutes  preceding  the  start  of  DEX,  defined  as  Systolic  Blood Pressure  (SBP)  &lt;  70  mmHg;  5)  Pre-existing  bradycardia  based  on  repeated  assessments  within  15 minutes preceding the start of DEX, defined as Heart rate (HR) &lt; 70 bpm; 6) Subjects who had acute thermal burns involving more than 15% total body surface area; 7) Subjects who had a known allergy to DEX, MDZ or fentanyl; 8) Subjects who had received DEX within 15 hours prior to the start of study drug; 9) Subjects with a life expectancy that was &lt; 72 hours; 10) Subjects who were expected to have hemodialysis (continuous hemofiltration), peritoneal dialysis, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatments within 48 hours prior to the start of DEX or during the duration of the study; 11) Subjects who had been treated with alpha-2 agonists/antagonists within 2 weeks ; 12) Subjects with a spinal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cord  injury  above  T5;  13)  Subjects  who  had  received  another  investigational  drug  as  part  of  an investigational  drug  study  within  the  past  30  days;  and  14)  Subjects  who,  in  the  opinion  of  the investigator,  might  not  have  been  able  to  comply  with  the  safety  monitoring  requirements  of  this clinical study.

## Treatments

Following completion of screening procedures, the DEX infusion began after discontinuation of all other sedative  agents  and  after  the  subject  had  attained  a  University  of  Michigan  Sedation  Scale  (UMSS) score ≤ 4. Subjects were randomly assigned into 1 of 2 dose levels: dose level 1 consisted of a 0.7 mcg/kg  loading  dose  immediately  followed  by  a  0.5  mcg/kg/hr  maintenance  infusion;  dose  level  2 consisted of a 1 mcg/kg loading dose immediately followed by a 0.75 mcg/kg/hr maintenance infusion. The DEX infusion (10 - minute loading dose and continuous fixed maintenance dose) continued for a minimum of 6 hours but did not exceed 24 hours, including the loading dose time. Titration of dosing was not allowed.

If the subject was not adequately sedated as defined by a UMSS score of 2 to 4; rescue medication (midazolam:  MDZ)  was  administered  as  needed  for  sedation  during  DEX  administration  based  on results of the UMSS scale and investigator judgment. Similarly rescue opiate analgesia, consisting of IV fentanyl was administered, based on the judgment of the investigator or designee, or when the FLACC (Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability) score was &gt; 4.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Pharmacokinetics

The PK parameters included: AUC (area under the plasma concentration-time curve), Cmax (observed peak plasma  concentration), CL (plasma clearance), t1/2 (terminal half-life), Vd (volume  of distribution). Venous blood samples of 1ml were collected at the following timepoints: no more than 30 minutes  prior  to  start  of  the  loading  dose;  within  5  minutes  before  finishing  the  loading  dose;  30 minutes,  1,  2  and  4-6  hours  after  start  of  maintenance  infusion;  within  30  minutes  prior  to  end  of maintenance infusion (must be within 24 hours of start of   maintenance infusion); 10 minutes after end of maintenance infusion, and 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, and 10 hours after end of maintenance infusion.

## Pharmacodynamics

1)  Whenever  possible,  the  same  investigator  or  designee  obtained  UMSS  scores  according  to  the following schedule: just prior to loading dose, and then at 5 and 10 minutes during loading dose; at the start of maintenance of infusion, and at 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 minutes for the first hour; every 4 hours thereafter during the remainder of the maintenance infusion; within 5 minutes of obtaining each PK sample; if rescue medication was given, UMSS measurements were obtained before and within 5 minutes after any MDZ rescue administration during DEX infusion period.

2)  The pain assessments were collected according to the following schedule: immediately prior to the loading  dose;  hourly  during  the  maintenance  infusion;  within  5  minutes  after  any  fentanyl  bolus administered  for  pain  during  DEX  infusion  or  every  4  hours  if  receiving  a  continuous  infusion  of fentanyl. If on a continuous infusion of fentanyl, and the drug was titrated, FLACC assessments were collected within 5 minutes prior to and within 5 minutes following titration.

## Statistical Methods

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The full evaluable (FE) population consisted of all subjects who received study drug for at least 5 hours with adequate PK samples. The safety evaluable (SE) population consisted of all subjects who received any amount of study drug. It was stated that descriptive statistics only were planned for all analyses, both PK and PD, because of the small sample size (only 3 subjects per dose), although non-significant p-values were supplied for the analysis of time to successful extubation and time to rescue medication (using  the  log-rank  and  Wilcoxon  tests).  The  choice  of  sample  size  was  not  based  on  statistical considerations.

## 1.2.1.2. Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A  total  of  5  subjects  were  randomized  at  one  site  in  the  United  States  (US).  Two  subjects  were randomized to dose level 1 and 3 subjects to dose level 2. There were no drop-outs and the evaluable population was the same as the safety population.  Two female and three male patients were enrolled. Four subjects were white and 1 subject declined specification of race. One female was randomised to each dose group. One boy was randomised to the lower dose group and two to the higher group.

## Patient characteristics

The mean age was 17.30 months (range 14.60 - 21.20). The mean height and weight were similar for dose levels 1 and 2 (73.75 and 76.17 cm; 10.04 and 10.50 kg, respectively). The height ranged from 72.5cm  to  82.0cm  and  weight  8.9kg  to  13.5kg.    The  most  common  medical  history  included cardiovascular and respiratory disease in all 5 subjects. Four of the five subjects had gastrointestinal conditions. All subjects were post-surgery.

## Pharmacodynamics

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two subjects (40.0%) received rescue MDZ for sedation during DEX infusion: 1 (50%) subject in dose level 1 and 1 (33.3%) in dose level 2. Three subjects (60.0%) received rescue fentanyl for analgesia during DEX infusion: 1 (50.0%) subject in dose level 1 and 2 (66.7%). subjects in dose level 2.  No observations were made regarding the time to first dose of rescue medication due to the small number of subjects.

For dose levels 1 and 2, the median absolute time spent in the UMSS score between 2 and 4 (target level of sedation) was 3.6 hours (58.9% of the time) and 5.9 hours (95.1% of the time), respectively. The median absolute time spent with a total UMSS score &lt; 2 for dose levels 1 and 2 was 2.5 hours (41.1% of the time) and 0.3 hours (4.9%), respectively.  The median total FLACC score was 1.6 in dose level 1 and 4.4 in dose level 2, and 3.2 for both dose levels combined.  However, these results were  confounded  by  administration  of  concomitant  sedative/analgesic  drugs  during  DEX  infusion  as detailed above.

## Safety

Only  1  of  the  5  subjects  (20.0%)  experienced  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs).  These events were mild pyrexia and mild atelectasis in a dose level 2 subject; both events were considered not related to DEX. There were no treatment-emergent SAEs leading to death, no other treatmentemergent SAEs, and no TEAEs that led to DEX discontinuation.

## 1.2.2. Study DEX-09-08

This  study  was  a  Phase  II/III,  open  label,  multi-centre,  study  of  the  safety,  efficacy  and  PK  of dexmedetomidine in neonates aged ≥ 28 weeks through ≤ 44 weeks gestational age.  The objective was to characterize the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of dexmedetomidine administered as an IV loading dose followed by a continuous IV infusion in neonates.

The study design is summarised in Figure 2.

## 1.2.2.1. Methodology

## Study participants

## Inclusion criteria

These  were  as  follows:  1)  Initially  intubated  and  mechanically  ventilated  pediatric  subjects  in  an intensive care setting anticipated to require a minimum of 6 hours of continuous IV sedation; 2) The ability to complete all PK sampling and blood draws; 3) Age: subjects had to fit into 1 of the following age ranges at screening: preterm neonates ≥ 28 weeks through &lt; 36 weeks, gestational age; this constituted treatment age group I; term neonates born at ≥ 36 weeks through ≤ 44 weeks gestational age; this constituted treatment age group II (gestation age was calculated as follows: the time elapsed between the first day of the last menstrual period and the day of enrolment), and 4) Weight: subject's weight at the time of enrollment had to be &gt; 1000 g.

## Exclusion criteria

These were as follows: 1) Neonate subjects with neurological conditions that prohibited an evaluation of  sedation  (e.g  diminished  consciousness  from  increased  intracranial  pressure,  the  presence  of catastrophic  brain  injury  or  other  severe  mental  disorders  that  would  make  responses  to  sedatives unpredictable and/or measurement  of the N-PASS  unreliable; subjects with immobility from neuromuscular disease or continuous infusion of NMB agents); 2) Subjects with second degree or third degree heart block unless subject had a pacemaker or pacing wires were in situ; 3) HR &lt; 120 bpm prior  to  the  initiation  of  DEX.;  4)  Exposure  to  any  investigational  drug  within  30  days  prior  to  DEX administration; 5) Previous exposure to DEX as part of an investigational study; 6)  In subjects that were ex-utero for less than 72 hours, a maternal history of poly-substance drug abuse, based upon the investigator's clinical judgment; 7) At the discretion of the investigator, subjects in whom the risk of DEX  treatment  was  expected  to  exceed  its  benefits;  8)  Subjects  who  had  a  known  allergy  or contraindication  to  fentanyl,  morphine,  MDZ,  DEX,  or  other  alpha-2  agonists;  9)  Requirement  for medications other than DEX, MDZ, morphine, or fentanyl for sedation and pain control; 10) Screening ALT levels &gt; 115 U/L.

## Treatment

Subjects were sequentially assigned a loading dose (mcg/kg) and continuous infusion dose (mcg/kg/hr)  as  outlined  in  Table  3.  Subjects  were  administered  a  10  to  20-minute  loading  dose followed by a maintenance dose of a minimum of 6 hours up to a maximum of 24 hours. At baseline, subjects  were  assigned  into  either  age  group  I  or  age  group  II  based  on  gestational  age;  weight criteria were also used to determine PK sampling. Both groups could enrol simultaneously; however, within each group, the next dose level could not begin to enrol until all subjects had completed the previous dose level and the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) had approved enrolment to the next level.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Rescue medication was administered as needed for sedation (MDZ) and pain (fentanyl or morphine), during DEX administration based on results of the neonatal- Pain, Agitation, Sedation Scale (N-PASS). Rescue  therapy  was  indicated  when  the  total  N-PASS  score  was  &gt;  3  or  by  clinical  judgment  and whether  the  subject  was  intubated  or  extubated  and  the  selection  of  sedative  rescue  or  analgesic rescue was at the discretion of the Investigator.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Pharmacokinetics

The PK parameters were the same as in study DEX-11-01. Arterial, venous, or capillary blood samples (0.15 mL each) for PK analysis were obtained at 6 or 7 protocol-designated times for subjects in age group I depending upon weight (≥ 28 weeks through &lt; 36 weeks gestational age) and at 7 designated times for subjects in age group II (≥ 36 weeks through ≤ 44 weeks gestational age).

## Efficacy

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  for  the  study  was  the  number  of  subjects  requiring  any  rescue medication (MDZ) for sedation during DEX infusion.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included: incidence of rescue medication use for analgesia during DEX infusion; (a) The total amount and (b) the weight adjusted total amount (per kg) of rescue medication MDZ, morphine or fentanyl given for sedation and analgesia during DEX infusion; change from baseline in vital signs and oxygenation (SpO2) measures during DEX infusion; time spent with a total N-PASS score &gt; 3 and ≤ 3 during DEX infusion and time to extubation was explored in DEX-exposed subjects.

## Statistical methods

The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all patients who met all of the inclusion criteria, none of the exclusion criteria. The safety evaluable (SE) population included all patients who received DEX. The efficacy evaluable (EE) population was all subjects who received DEX for at least 6 hours. This was the primary population for the efficacy analysis. The PK evaluable population included all patients in the EE population  with  adequate  DEX  concentration  data.  This  was  the  primary  population  for  the  PK analysis.The primary analysis, the percentage of subjects that required MDZ for sedation during DEX infusion, was summarised using descriptive statistics. All other endpoints were also summarised using summary statistics.  Statistical  analyses  comparing  age  groups  and  dose  levels  were  planned  in  the protocol for the final analysis, but in the end the study was terminated early before the full amount of patients in age group I were recruited and no formal statistical analysis was conducted.

The sample size was planned based on a pairwise comparison between the high and low dose groups. It was expected that 90% of subjects on the lowest dose would require rescue medication for sedation and 45% in the highest dose group. Thus with 14 patients in each dose group there would be 72% power to detect a difference, assuming a 1-sided test at the 5% level.

## 1.2.2.2. Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

Nine sites enrolled 30 subjects for the interim analysis. Data from a further 6 subjects of age group I, dose level 2 were collected after the data cut off of subjects enrolled for the interim analyses and were included in an addendum report.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study was officially discontinued early on 17 August 2011 for reasons unrelated to safety. A total of 36 subjects have been evaluated out of a total of 42 originally planned. The 6 subjects planned to be enrolled  and  analyzed  for  dose  level  3  (0.2  mcg/kg  loading  dose  and  0.2  mcg/kg/hr  maintenance dosing) for age group I (ages ≥ 28 weeks through &lt; 36 weeks gestational age) were not enrolled or evaluated.

## Patient characteristics

The  mean gestational  age  in  weeks  for  age  group  I  was  30.3  weeks;  for  age  group  II  it  was  38.7 weeks. For all 30 subjects in both age groups I and II combined, the mean gestational age in weeks was 37.0 weeks. Predominantly males were enrolled in this study; however, females were predominant in age group I only. The majority of neonates were Caucasian. The mean weight for age group I was 1.38 kg and for age group II, 3.26 kg, and for all 30 subjects in both age groups I and II combined 2.88 kg. A further 6 patients (3 male, 3 female) were recruited after the interim analysis with a mean gestational age of 32.5 weeks. Mean height was 42.75cm and weight 1.71kg. The subjects were all in age group I, dose level 2.

In age group I, cardiopulmonary disease affected 5 subjects (83.3%). Congenital heart disease was present in 1/6 subjects (16.6%). In addition, all subjects in this age group had prematurity-induced respiratory disorders (n=6, 100.0%) and one-half of these had hematologic disease (n=3; 50.0%). No subjects in this age group were post-surgical.

Within age group II, the 3 dose levels had a variety of medical history, more subjects had congenital heart disease and more subjects were post-operative cardiac surgery, particularly in dose level 3. In age  group  II,  congenital  heart  disease  was  present  in  17/24  subjects  (70.8%)  as  follows:  7  of  8

subjects in dose level 1, 3 of 8 subjects in dose level 2, and 7of 8 subjects in dose level 3. The other most  common  body  systems  in  this  age  group  were  gastrointestinal  disease  (n=10,  41.7%)  and respiratory  disease  (n=13,  54.2%).  Two  subjects  in  dose  level  2  had  gastroschisis.  At  the  start  of study drug administration, 12 of 24 (50.0%) subjects were post-operative surgery: 3 of 8 in dose level 1, 2 of 8 in dose level 2, and 7 of 8 in dose level 3.

## Post-interim patients

None  of  the  6  post-interim  analysis  patients  received  rescue  MDZ  for  sedation  during  the  study infusion. 1 subject  received rescue medication for analgesia during DEX infusion. This subject received 2 mcg (0.98 mcg/kg) fentanyl for rescue analgesia during DEX infusion.

## Safety

Most TEAEs were considered as not related to treatment, 2 subjects in age group II experienced TEAEs considered  as  related  to  treatment.  There  were  no  severe  TEAEs  reported,  2  subjects  in  each  age group  experienced  moderate  TEAEs,  all  other  subjects  experienced  mild  TEAEs.  There  were  no treatment-emergent SAEs leading to death, no other treatment-emergent SAEs, and no TEAEs that led to  drug  discontinuation.  There  were  no  dose-limiting  toxicities  that  led  to  drug  discontinuation (persistent bradycardia, persistent hypotension, or respiratory  depression).  One  non-treatment

## 1.2.3. Study DEX-08-05

This  was  a  phase  III,  randomized,  double-blind,  dose-controlled,  multicentre  study  evaluating  the safety  and  efficacy  of  dexmedetomidine  in  intubated  and  mechanically  ventilated  paediatric  ICU patients. The objectives were: 1) to characterize the loading and maintenance dosing of DEX by age group  and  overall  medical  condition  of  pediatric  subjects;  2)  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of loading  and  maintenance  infusions  for  sedation  in  initially  intubated  and  mechanically  ventilated paediatric ICU subjects; and 3) to explore the exposure-response relationship between dose of DEX and clinical measures of sedation and safety. The study design is summarised in Figure 3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 3

<!-- image -->

Subjects were randomized into 1 of 2 treatment groups: high dose DEX and low dose DEX. There was no  placebo  arm.  Within  each  treatment  group,  the  loading  and  maintenance  doses  were  stratified according to the presence or absence of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB): 1) Group 1 = low dose DEX; 2) Group 2 = high dose DEX; 3) Group 1a and 2a = post CPB (DEX started within 24 hours after end of surgery) ; 4) Group 1b and 2b = all other diagnoses. Subjects were also grouped by age; age group 1 included  subjects ≥ 1  month to &lt;24 months old (if premature, corrected for gestational age until 3 months of actual birth age); age group II included subjects ≥ 24 month to &lt;17 years old.

## 1.2.3.1. Methodology

## Study participants

## Inclusion criteria

These were as follows: 1) Initially intubated and mechanically ventilated pediatric subjects ( ≥ 1 month (birth age corrected for prematurity) to &lt;17 years of age) in an intensive care setting. The means by which  the  subject  was  intubated  could  include  nasotracheal,  endotracheal  or  via  tracheotomy.  The subject must have been mechanically ventilated prior to and during the commencement of study drug; 2) Anticipated to require a minimum of 6 hours of continuous intravenous (IV) sedation; 3) American Association  of  Anesthesiologists  (ASA)  physical  status  classification:  P1,  P2,  P3,  or  P4;  4)  A  UMSS score of 1, 2, 3, or 4 at the start of infusion of study drug and 5) A dose had been established for this subject's age.

## Exclusion criteria

These  were  as  follows:  1)  Subjects  with  neurological  conditions  that  prohibited  an  evaluation  of sedation  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator  (e.g.,  increased  intracranial  pressure  or  extensive  brain

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

surgery);  2)The  infusion  pump  minimal  capacity  could  not  accommodate  the  lowest  possible maintenance infusion rate of study drug based on subject's weight; 3) Subjects with second degree or third  degree  heart  block  unless  subject  had  a  pacemaker  or  pacing  wires;  4)  Hypotension  that persisted beyond a 15-minute period of re-assessment prior to starting study drug: age 1 month to ≤ 6 months old: SBP &lt;60 mmHg, age &gt;6 months to &lt;2 years old: SBP &lt;70 mmHg, age &gt;2 to &lt;12 years old: SBP &lt;80 mmHg and age &gt;12 to &lt;17 years old: SBP &lt;90 mmHg; 5) Pre-existing bradycardia that persisted beyond a 15-minute period of re-assessment prior to starting study drug:  age 1 month to &lt;2 months old: HR &lt;90 bpm, age ≥ 2 months to &lt;12 months old: HR &lt;80 bpm, age ≥ 12 months to &lt;2 years old: HR &lt;70 bpm, age ≥ 2 to &lt;12 years old: HR &lt;60 bpm, age ≥ 12 to &lt;17 yrs old: HR &lt;50 bpm; 6) ALT/ SGPT: 1 month to 12 months old: &gt;165 U/L, &gt;12 months to &lt;17 years old: ≥ 100U/L; 7) Subjects had a known allergy to DEX, MDZ, morphine, or fentanyl; 8) Requirement for medications other  than  DEX,  MDZ,  morphine,  or  fentanyl  for  sedation  and  pain  control  and  9)  Subjects  with immobility  from  neuromuscular  disease,  paralysis  from  administration  of  NMB  agents,  spinal  cord injury  above  T5  or  subjects  with  muscle  weakness  from  congenital  or  systemic  medical  illness etiologies, subjects who received NMB agents intraoperatively had to be, in the investigator's opinion, free of residual neuromuscular blockade prior to dosing with study drug.

## Treatment

Treatment could be administered as follows: 1) an optional 10-20 minute loading dose infusion of DEX followed by a continuous titratable maintenance dose infusion of DEX for a minimum of 6 hours up to 24 hours. It was recommended that subjects who were on open-label DEX prior to starting the study not receive a loading dose, but the decision was at the discretion of the Investigator; or 2) No loading dose and a continuous titratable maintenance dose infusion of DEX for a minimum of 6 hours up to 24 hours. It was to be administered through a designated IV line or port on a central line. The doses were according to Table 12:

The target UMSS was a score between 1-3. If required, MDZ could be titrated as a rescue medication at the discretion of the investigator as follows: &lt;6 months: 0.05-0.1 mg/kg; 6 months to 5 years old : 0.05-0.1 mg/kg; 6 to 12 years old: 0.025-0.05 mg/kg; &gt;12 (Adult): 1-3 mg.

If  rescue  MDZ  was  considered  necessary,  the  DEX  dose  was  titrated  upwards  and  the  need  to administer additional midazolam reassessed following DEX administration. Fentanyl or morphine could be administered to treat pain, after the subject was first treated with an increase in the DEX infusion rate, at age-specific doses, or as a continuous infusion at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

receiving  continuous  infusions  of  fentanyl  or  morphine  prior  to  randomization  could  continue  these infusions throughout study drug administration if required.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent of subjects that did not require rescue midazolam for sedation based on achieving and maintaining a target UMSS score of 1-3 while intubated.

Secondary endpoints included the absolute time and percentage of time on study drug that the subject was in a UMSS score range of 1 to 3 while intubated; absolute time and percentage of time on study drug that the subject was out of the target sedation range while intubated (UMSS score of 0 or 4); total  amount  of  rescue  medication  required  for  sedation  and  analgesia;  time  to  first  dose  of  rescue medication for sedation and analgesia; and time to extubation.

## Statistical Methods

The study was powered to give 80% power at the 2-sided 5% level to detect a difference of 17-20% in the proportion of patients not requiring rescue MDZ.  The rate on the high dose group was assumed to be  around  62-77%.  Three  analysis  populations  were  defined.  The  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population included  all  randomised  subjects;  the  safety  evaluable  (SE)  population  included  all  patients  that received any dose of Dexdor; the efficacy evaluable (EE) population included all patients who received Dexdor for at least 6 hours. The EE population was primary for the analysis of efficacy. The primary efficacy variable, the percentage of patients that did not require rescue MDZ (based on achieving and maintaining a target UMSS range of 1-3 while intubated), was compared between treatment groups using  the  normal  approximation  to  the  binomial  distribution.  The  absolute  time  and  the  percentage time  on  study  drug  that  the  patient  was  in  a  UMSS  range  of  1-3  while  intubated  were  compared between treatment groups using a Wilcoxon test. Time to successful extubation, and time to first dose of  rescue  medication  for  sedation  and  analgesia  while  on  study  drug  were  compared  between treatment groups using a log-rank test and summarised using Kaplan-Meier estimates.

Time to extubation was analyzed for measurable assessment and 41 subjects were excluded from this analysis.

## Patient characteristics

In age group I, median age was 8.51 months (low dose) and 9.75 months (high dose); in age group II, median age was 6.32 years (low dose) and 7.57 years (high dose). Subjects had similar screening ASA classification in both age groups and both DEX dose groups with the majority of subjects high risk with severe systemic disease, P3. Subjects who underwent open-heart surgery (s/p CPB) were mostly high risk P3 and there were similar numbers of subjects in the low dose (72.2%) and high dose (73.0%) DEX groups s/p CPB.

Median age of subjects was similar across dose groups and by underlying condition; median age of age groups combined was 10.7 months (range: 0.9 months to 16.3 years) in the low dose group and 14.7 months (range: 1.3 months to 16.2 years) in the high dose group. Height and weight were similar across  dose  groups  and  by  underlying  condition  (median  height  of  age  groups  combined:  low  dose 68.0 cm, high dose 76.5 cm; median weight of age groups combined: low dose 8.1 kg; high dose 8.5 kg).

Overall,  approximately  70.0%  of  subjects  were  Caucasian  (low  dose,  71.9%;  high  dose,  72.1%). Slightly more subjects overall were male than female (low dose, 59.6% male; high dose, 55.8% male). Most  subjects  had  cardiopulmonary  disease  at  baseline.  Body  systems  in  which  50.0%  or  more subjects overall had at least 1 report were cardiopulmonary (low dose, 73.0%; high dose, 81.4%) and respiratory (low dose, 55.1%; high dose, 61.6%).

All subjects (100.0%) in the high dose group and all except 1 subject in the low dose group received at least 1 concomitant medication during the study. Concomitant medications taken by at least 50.0% of subjects in a dose group, excluding MDZ, fentanyl, and morphine, the use of which was permitted as rescue medication per protocol, were furosemide, acetaminophen, potassium chloride, and heparin. In the s/p CPB groups following open heart surgery, &gt;90% of subjects were on inotropic support postop. Inotropic support with milrinone and dobutamine was similar in both the low and high dose DEX groups s/p CPB.

The most common reason for study discontinuation was loss to follow-up:  6 (6.7%) subjects in the low dose group and 7 (8.1%) in the high dose group did not complete the post-dose day 28  follow-up. Other reasons for study discontinuation were AE and physician reason:  2 (2.2%) subjects in the low dose group and 1 (1.2%) in the high dose group. Other discontinuations included death unrelated to DEX (1 (1.2%) subject each in the low dose and high dose groups), and discontinuation due to data that were not collected.

## Secondary Efficacy

There was no significant difference between treatment groups for the absolute time and percentage of time that subjects were in the UMSS range 1-3 during the treatment. All age groups and diagnoses receiving the high dose of DEX were in the targeted UMSS range 87.8 to 99.2% of the time compared to 85.5 to 99.0% of the time in the low dose DEX groups.

Differences  between  treatment  groups  in  total  amount  of  rescue  medication  required  for  sedation (MDZ) or analgesia (fentanyl and morphine) are presented in Tables 17-19.

## Safety

TEAEs  were  experienced  by  33/63  subjects  (52.4%;  82  events)  in  the  low  dose  group  and  27/60 subjects (45.0%; 57 events) in the high dose DEX group. In age group II, TEAEs were experienced by 15/26 subjects (57.7%; 39 events) in the low dose group and 16/26 subjects (61.5%; 31 events) in the high dose DEX group. In age group I, moderate and severe TEAEs were experienced by 17 (27.0%; 30 events) and 10 subjects (16.7%; 17 events) in the low and high dose groups, respectively; and in age group II, moderate and severe TEAEs were experienced by 8 (30.8%; 13 events) and 6 subjects (23.1%; 9 events) in the low and high dose groups, respectively.

Overall, 5/175 subjects (2.9%) reported a total of 7 severe TEAEs; all severe TEAEs were reported in the  low  dose  DEX  groups.  The  severe  TEAEs  reported  were  myocarditis,  pyrexia,  status  epilepticus, dyspnea,  ventricular  fibrillation,  chest  pain,  and  wheezing.  The  severe  myocarditis  event  was  also considered a serious TEAE and treatment-related. There were 4 deaths and these were considered not related to DEX.

Treatment-emergent mild  blood  cortisol  increased  was  experienced  by  1  subject  (1.7%)  in  the  age group  I,  in  high  dose  DEX  and  other  diagnoses  group,  and  was  considered  not  related  to  DEX.  All subjects  studied  had  an  increase  in  cortisol  in  response  to  cosyntropin  (ACTH)  1  hour  after discontinuing DEX. There was no evidence of adrenal suppression based on cortisol levels at the time of discontinuation of DEX or with the cortisol response to cosyntropin.

## 1.2.4. Additional analysis

A population PK (PPK) analysis was performed by the MAH with the following objectives : 1) to conduct an exploratory review of data from four studies in paediatric patients in order to characterise the data and evaluate the assumptions and appropriateness of the model to be developed; 2) to develop a PPK model  describing  the  PK  of  Dexdor  in  paediatric  subjects  (including  neonates);  and  3)  assess  the influence of demographic covariates and concomitant medications on the variability in the PPK model parameters.

A  total  of  184,  427,  615,  and  54  dexmedetomidine  concentration  records  from  30,  35,  54,  and  5 pediatric  subjects  enrolled  in  studies  DEX-09-08,  DEX-08-05  (CHOP),  DEX-08-01  and  DEX-11-01, respectively, were included. Of the 124 subjects, a sizable number were below the age of two (n=62, 50%) with 28 pre-term and term neonates (22% of total), 14 between the ages of 1 and 6 months (11%), 15 between 6 months and 1 year (12%) and 13 between 12 months and 2 years (11%).

The applicant conclusions were as follows:

- The final base structural PK model was a 2-compartment model with interindividual variability (IIV) estimated on clearance (CL), intercompartmental clearance (Q), volume of the central compartmental (Vc), and volume of the peripheral compartment (Vp) using exponential error models, fixed allometric exponents  on  the  clearance  (0.75  for  CL  and  Q)  and  volume  of  distribution  (1.0  for  Vc  and  Vp) parameters,  with  an  additional  shift  on  the  CL  exponent  for  neonates,  age  effects  on  Q  and  Vp described by power functions (both decrease with increasing age), covariance terms for the IIVs on CL and Vp, and the IIVs on Q and Vc, separate additive plus constant coefficient of variation error models for Studies DEX-08-01 and CHOP, and a constant coefficient of variation error model for Studies DEX09-08 and DEX-11-01:
- -The intercompartmental clearance and the volume of the peripheral compartment for dexmedetomidine were both found to be related to maturation, as described by age, according to a power function (both decrease with increasing age).
-  The  effects  of  ethnicity,  sex,  alanine  aminotransferase,  total  bilirubin,  heart  physiology  (singleversus double-ventricle), use of concomitant glucuronidation pathway inhibitors, albumin infusion, use of  cardio-pulmonary  bypass,  and  site  of  sampling  were  not  identified  as  statistically  significant predictors of dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetic variability.
-  Clearance  estimates  from  this  model  increase  with  increasing  age  and  weight-adjusted  clearance estimates decrease with increasing age, approaching values expected in adults.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Volume of distribution estimates from this model increase with increasing age and weight-adjusted volume of distribution estimates decrease with increasing age, approaching values expected in adults.
- The model evaluation supports the robustness of the model to predict well over the entire range of concentrations.
-  Using  the  final  population  PK  model  for  dexmedetomidine,  95%  confidence  intervals  expressed relative to the corresponding point estimates of the geometric mean of the CL and Vc were within the targeted range of 0.6 to 1.4, except in the 6-17 years age group where the upper bound on Vc was 1.43,  however  all  confidence  interval  bounds  were  well  within  the  range  when  PK  parameters  were adjusted for body weight.

## Additional analysis using model based on PMA

At  the  CHMP  request,  the  applicant  provided  additional  analyses  of  maturation  using  different  ages (PNA: postnatal age, PMA: post-menstrual age: post, GA: gestational age). The resulting model based on PMA showed a very different structural model equation from the original PNA model:

According to the applicant, despite this finding, the PK of dexmedetomidine in the pediatric population was statistically significantly related to both body weight and maturation in both models.

## 1.2.5. Discussion

Across the completed paediatric studies, Dexdor has been studied in neonates, infants, children and adolescents  aged  from  gestational  age  28  weeks  to  17  years.  The  doses  studied  have  ranged  from 0.05 - 7 µg/kg/hr given for a maximum of 24 hours.

## Study DEX-11-01 (12 months to &lt;24 months)

According to the applicant, exposure to DEX, measured as Cmax or AUC, appeared to be dose-related, although highly variable. Mean Cmax increased from 4500 pg/mL in dose level 1 to 11737 pg/mL in dose level 2, while dose adjusted Cmax was fairly constant. Likewise, AUC (0-Infinity) increased from 4639 (pg/mL)hr in dose level 1 to 14204 (pg/mL)hr in dose level 2, whereas dose-adjusted AUC (0Infinity)  was  fairly  constant.    Dexmedetomidine  half-life  was  about  2  hours  in  all  subjects  and  was independent of dose. With the exception of one outlier in dose level 1, both CL and CLw were fairly constant  across  both  dose  levels.  Clearance  was  about  5.7  L/hr  (2.5  to  8.2  L/hr)  whereas  weight adjusted CL was about 0.6 L/hr/kg (0.2 to 0.9 L/hr/kg). Vd was also fairly constant across both dose levels. Again with the exclusion of the outlier in dose level 1, Vd was about 16.2 L (13.4 to 19.9 L) whereas weight adjusted Vd was about 1.6 L/kg (0.99 to 2.23 L/kg).

The  CHMP was of the opinion that  given  the  small  number  of  patients  included  (n=5),  labelling  an individual as an 'outlier' could be questioned and therefore from the CHMP viewpoint, the results in this study may only conclude to a very high inter-individual variability with regard to pharmacokinetics. It is known from the adult patient population PK that dexmedetomidine appeared to exhibit an essentially linear  relationship  at  steady  state  between  infusion  rate  and  plasma  concentration  and  the  plasma clearance  of  dexmedetomidine  is  approximately  constant  within  the  anticipated  therapeutic  infusion dose range. The mean estimate of the elimination t1/2 is approximately 1.9 to 2.5 hours (min 1.35 h and max 3.68 h). On this basis, no major findings are identified in this study performed in a small patient population and the PK profile appeared to be behave similarly to that in the adult population. No conclusions could be drawn regarding pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile and efficacy, due to the small number of patients.

## Study DEX-09-08 (&gt;28 weeks to &lt;44 weeks gestational age)

In  this  study,  the  ITT,  SE  and  EE  populations  were  identical.  Although,  no  statistical  analysis  was performed due to early termination of the study, the sample size calculation could be questioned as 1sided tests at the 5% level are not usually accepted. The CHMP noted that study DEX-09-08 seeks to further  characterise  the  PK  and  efficacy  of  Dexmedetomidine  in  neonates,  one  of  the  paediatric population where these data were currently lacking.

No subject in age group I received rescue MDZ for sedation during the study infusion. In age group II, a total of 4 subjects (16.7%) received rescue MDZ for sedation during the study infusion: 1 subject each (12.5%) in dose level 1 and dose level 2, and 2 subjects (25.0%) in dose level 3, resulting in a combined age group I and II total of 4 subjects (13.3%). None of the 6 post-interim analysis patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

received rescue MDZ for sedation during the study infusion. 1 subject  received rescue medication for analgesia  during  DEX  infusion.  This  subject  received  2  mcg  (0.98  mcg/kg)  fentanyl  for  rescue analgesia  during  DEX  infusion.  One  subject  (16.7%)  in  age  group  I  received  rescue  medication  for analgesia during the study infusion. In age group II, a total of 14 subjects (58.3%) received rescue medication for analgesia during the study infusion: 4 subjects each (50.0%) in dose level 1 and dose level 2, and 6 subjects (75.0%) in dose level 3, resulting in a combined age group I and II total of 15 subjects (50.0%).

More  subjects  in  age  group  II  were  post-operative  surgical,  particularly  dose  level  3  where  most subjects were post-operative open heart surgery for congenital heart disease and likely required more medication for sedation and analgesia. In addition, the 8 subjects in age group II, dose level 3 received maintenance dosing for a median duration of nearly 3 times longer than subjects in dose levels 2 and 1. The premature neonates in age group I were adequately sedated with DEX alone and only 1 subject required additional rescue for pain. The low doses of DEX, up to 0.2 mcg/kg/hr, used in this trial in the term  neonates  was  not  sufficient  to  consistently  sedate  and  keep  this  age  group  comfortable.  It  is noted  that  in  dose  level  3  includes  more  post-surgical  patients  which  may  have  influenced  the increased analgesic requirements.

Despite the small numbers of patients; the clearance of Dexdor appeared to be lower in the younger children (Cl:0.49, Clw:0.41 in Age group I, 28-36 weeks). This finding is consistent with the work of Potts AL et al. who found that children younger than one year of age might have lower bodyweightadjusted  clearances  when  compared  to  older  children  and  adults  implying  that  higher  steady-state dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations would be predicted when dosing in proportion to bodyweight.

The predicted higher exposures were borne out in study DEX-09-08. This finding may have contributed to the lower requirement for rescue medication in the younger patient age group, although no clear dose response relationship could be elucidated. No discussion is provided as to the correlation between N-PASS scores and UMSS scores, although the CHMP accepted that both are validated scales for their respective age groups.

In this study, Dexdor appeared to exhibit a level of efficacy similar to that seen in older children and adults and is reasonably well tolerated.

## Study DEX-08-05 (≥1 month to &lt;17 years)

In this study, the definition of the EE population could be questioned as all patients randomised and treated  should  have  been  included  in  the  efficacy  analysis  (ie  patient  who  failed  to  receive  6  hours treatment with Dexdor were excluded, however such failure could be related to the performance of the product for that patient). Considering that the number of patients excluded from the EE population was small and fairly balanced across the treatment groups, the CHMP was of the opinion that this exclusion criteria did not hamper the validity of the presented results.

The study showed that Dexdor was able to maintain paediatric patients across different age groups and ASA status' at a target level of sedation in approximately 50% of cases. From the data of the initial MAA, this figure is slightly less than the proportion of adult subjects who were maintained at target sedation  levels  of  approximately  60%.  Overall,  the  results  are  difficult  to  interpret  since  the  study failed to show a statistically significant difference between the doses (as was planned for in the sample size calculation). Comparing the observed results with the estimates used for the study planning it is clear  that  this  is  because  the  high  dose  was  worse  than  expected.  Nevertheless,  no  significant difference between the dose groups was observed in terms of the primary or secondary endpoints, nor

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was any subgroup difference identified.  In the absence of a placebo arm (or an even lower dose) it cannot  be  determined  whether  the  study  had  sufficient  assay  sensitivity  to  detect  an  important difference between the doses should one exist. A further possibility is that the studied doses were 'too high' and on the flatter part of the dose-response curve - and there was truly no important difference between the doses. The CHMP was however reassured that no significant observations were made with regard to safety. It is noted that that a greater proportion of TEAEs were observed in the lower dose group than the high dose group.

Overall the high dose DEX group was numerically better sedated than the low dose DEX groups with 54.3%  of  high  dose  subjects  not  requiring  rescue  MDZ  compared  to  44.6%  in  the  low  dose  DEX groups. A smaller percentage of subjects in age group II did not require rescue MDZ for sedation in comparison with age group I in both DEX dose groups. In both dose groups subjects undergoing open heart  surgery  with  CPB  received  more  rescue  MDZ  than  those  in  the  other  diagnoses  groups.  The greatest difference between treatment groups was in the heart surgery subjects (s/p CPB) with more subjects in both age groups receiving high dose DEX than low dose DEX, not requiring MDZ sedation rescue. The pattern of results was similar whether subjects were more (ASA Classification P3, P4) or less critically ill (ASA Classification P1, P2).

There was no significant difference between treatment groups for the absolute time and percentage of time that subjects were in the UMSS range 1-3 during the treatment. All age groups and diagnoses receiving the high dose of DEX were in the targeted UMSS range 87.8 to 99.2% of the time compared to 85.5 to 99.0% of the time in the low dose DEX groups.

No difference was observed between groups for the amount of rescue midazolam, or requirement for rescue fentanyl or morphine for analgesia.

## Population pharmacokinetic analysis

Of the 124 subjects included in the analysis, a sizable number were below the age of two (n=62, 50%) with 28 pre-term and term neonates (22% of total), 14 between the ages of 1 and 6 months (11%), 15 between 6 months and 1 year (12%) and 13 between 12 months and 2 years (11%).  The CHMP agreed that the ages and weights represented in the 4 studies comprise a continuum of maturation and  size  (pre-term  and  term  neonates  to  nearly  adults)  and  that  the  younger  age  range,  where maturation is expected to play an important role, is well represented within the data set.

The methodology utilised for model development and evaluation is clearly described and is generally supported.  One of the studies included in the present population PK analysis (CHOP) was previously analysed and reported (Su 2010) and appeared to have been used as a starting point for the present analysis. However, the description of Su's structural model was inconsistent in the presented analysis and hence the CHMP could not endorse the applicant conclusions. On this basis and considering the different maturation status expected in preterm versus term neonates, age effects on Q and Vp and that  the  presented  data  was  only  based  on  post-natal  age,  additional  analysis  where  CL  and  Q  are related  to  WT 0.75 and  Vc  and  Vp  are  related  to  WT 1 as  a  base  model  and  exploratory  plots  of  CL (L/h/kg 0.75 ) and Vc, Q and Vp versus age (PNA, PMA, GA) were provided. The resulting model based on PMA  showed  very  different  structure  for  inclusion  of  maturation  effects  on  the  pharmacokinetic parameters  for  dexmedetomidine  compared  to  the  original  model  utilising  post-natal  age.    A comparison of the empirical bayes estimates derived from the two models based on log-log and linear scales was made, showing that  despite the different approach to inclusion of age in the two models, the resulting empirical bayes estimates of clearance were very similar with only very small differences for pre-term neonates.  This was however not true for any of the other model parameters, where the values differed (often markedly) between the two models (see Figure 5-15).  Despite these differences,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  two  models  predicted  similar  concentration-time  profiles  for  individual  subjects  and  also  show similar visual predictive checks.

Overall, the CHMP concluded that the relationship of drug clearance to age and weight was viewed as well estimated.  Also, the terminal half-life (thalf) is judged to be generally very similar between the two models.  When the mean values of CL and half-life for each age group are compared between the two models, they are in all cases less than 15% different from one another.  Thus, both models were judged to provide useful and reliable estimates of these parameters and inclusion of such information in section 5.2 of the SmPC was endorsed by the CHMP.

## 1.3. Changes to the Product Information

The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed (new text= underlined, deleted text: strikethrough):

## Summary of Product Characteristics

## Section 4.2

Paediatric population: The safety and efficacy of Dexdor in children aged 0 to 18 years has not been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. A dosing scheme similar to adults has been used in a predominantly postoperative ICU population aged  &gt;1 month, during use for up to 24 hours. A loading dose of around 0.5 to 1 mcg/kg over 10 to 20 minutes was commonly used in the studies but is probably not needed if the patient is already established on sedation. Treatment for longer than 24 hours has not been studied. In new-born infants maintenance doses above 0.2 mcg/kg/h have not been evaluated.

## Section 4.8

## Paediatric population

There is limited experience in children, most data has been obtained from short term exposure.  Children  &gt;  1  month  post-natal,  predominently  post-operative,  have  been  evaluated  for treatment up to 24 hours in the ICU and demonstated a similar safety profile as in adults. Data in newborn  infants  (28  -  44  weeks  gestation)  is  very  limited  and  restricted  to  maintenence  doses  ≤  0.2 mcg/kg/h. A single case of hypothermic bradycardia in a neonate has been reported in the literature.

## Section 5.1

Paediatric efficacy data from well controlled ICU studies is sparse but dexmedetomidine has been used as a sedative in childrenEvidence of paediatric efficacy was seen in a dose-controlled ICU study in a largely post-operative population aged 1 month to ≤ 17 years. Most patients were successfully sedated with dexmedetomidine during treatment up to 24 hours, although a difference between dose levels of dexmedetomidine was not demonstrated. Data on treatment for &gt; 24 hours is not available. Data in new-born infants (28 -44 weeks gestation) is very limited and restricted to low doses (≤ 0.2 mcg/kg/h)  (see sections 5.2 and 4.4). New-born infants may be particularly sensitive to the bradycardic effects of Dexdor in the presence of hypothermia and in conditions of heart rate-dependent cardiac output.

## Section 5.2

Data in children 2 months to 17 years of age are limited. Dexmedetomidine half life appears similar to that  seen  in  adults.  In  the  age  groups  2-20  months  and  2-6  years,  body  weight-adjusted  plasma clearance  appeared  higher  (1.2  and  1.0   l/h/kg,  respectively)  but  decreased  in  older  children (0.8 l/h/kg) to be comparable to adults (0.5-0.6 l/h/kg). Plasma clearance may be lower in children

&lt; 2 months due to immaturity.Data in new-born infants (28 - 44 weeks gestation) to children 17 years of age are limited. Dexmedetomidine half life in children (2 months to 17 years) appears similar to that seen in adults but in new-born infants (28 - 44 weeks gestation) it appears higher.  In the age groups 2-20  months  and  2-6  years,  body  weight-adjusted  plasma  clearance  appeared  higher  (1.2  and 1.0  l/h/kg, respectively) but decreased in older children (0.8 l/h/kg) to be comparable to adults (0.50.6 l/h/kg).  Body  weight-adjusted  plasma  clearance    in    new-born  infants  (28  weeks  gestation  to 1 month) appeared lower (0.9 l/h/kg) than in the age groups 2-20 months due to immaturity.

During the procedure, the CHMP requested further amendments to the PI including the deletion of the dosing information in section 4.2 since the present application was not related to a paediatric indication and the inclusion in section 5.2 of a table with both mean values of the clearance and half life and some estimates of variability. The CHMP considered the MAH proposal to state that 'the clearance in older children decreased to be comparable to clearance in adults (0.5 - 0.6 L/h/kg)' was misleading. The point estimate of clearance for the 6 - 17 year olds was 0.8 and confidence interval 0.69 to 0.92 L/h/kg. The requested amendments in addition to revision of part of the proposed text in section 5.1 were agreed by the MAH. The final recommended PI changes by the CHMP can be read as follows:

## Section 4.2

Paediatric  population : Currently  available  data  are  described  in  sections  4.8,  5.1,  5.2  but  no recommendation on a posology can be made.

## Section 4.8

## Paediatric population

Children &gt; 1 month post-natal, predominently post-operative, have been evaluated for treatment up to 24 hours in the ICU and demonstrated a similar safety profile as in adults. Data in new-born infants (28  -  44  weeks  gestation)  is  very  limited  and  restricted  to  maintenance  doses  ≤  0.2  mcg/kg/h.  A single case of hypothermic bradycardia in a neonate has been reported in the literature.

## Section 5.1

Evidence  of  paediatric  efficacy  was  seen  in  a  dose-controlled  ICU  study  in  a  largely  post-operative population aged 1 month to ≤ 17 years. Approximately 50%  of patients treated with dexmedetomidine did not require rescue addition of midazolam during a median treatment period of 20.3 hours, not exceeding 24 hours. Data on treatment for &gt; 24 hours is not available. Data in newborn infants (28 - 44 weeks gestation) is very limited and restricted to low doses (≤ 0.2 mcg/kg/h) (see sections 5.2 and 4.4). New-born infants may be particularly sensitive to the bradycardic effects of Dexdor in the presence of hypothermia and in conditions of heart rate-dependent cardiac output.

## Section 5.2

Data  in  new-born  infants  (28  -  44 weeks  gestation)  to  children  17 years  of  age  are  limited. Dexmedetomidine half life in children (1 months to 17 years) appears similar to that seen in adults, but in new-born infants (under 1 month) it appears higher. In the age groups 1 months to 6 years, body weight-adjusted plasma clearance appeared higher but decreased in older children. Body weightadjusted plasma clearance in new-born infants (under 1 month) appeared lower (0.9 l/h/kg) than in the older groups due to immaturity. The available data is summarised in the following table:

In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the representative of Italy. Annex II was also updated in accordance with the latest template.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

On the basis of the submitted data, the CHMP concluded that the update of the Product Information to include  new  paediatric  information  from  new-born  infants  (28  -  44 weeks  gestation)  to  adolescents aged 17 years old, was adequate. The CHMP considered that this change does not affect the benefit risk profile of the product which remains positive.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:
