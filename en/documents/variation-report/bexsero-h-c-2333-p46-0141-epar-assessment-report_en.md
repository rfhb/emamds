- V72P12E2 'A Phase 3, Open Label, Multicenter, Extension Study to Assess Antibody Persistence and Response to a Third or Fifth Dose of Novartis Meningococcal B Recombinant Vaccine in 4-Year-Old Children Who Previously Participated in Study V72P12E1'

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

V72P12E2 'A Phase 3, Open Label, Multicenter, Extension Study to Assess Antibody Persistence and Response to a Third or Fifth Dose of Novartis Meningococcal B Recombinant Vaccine in 4-Year-Old Children Who Previously Participated in Study V72P12E1'

## Description

## Methods

## Objectives

## Primary

To explore antibody persistence in 4-year-old children after a fourth dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ administered at either 12, 18, or 24 months of age in study V72P12E1, in toddlers who previously

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

received a three-dose primary series of rMenB+OMV NZ (at 2, 3, 4 or 2, 4, 6 months of age) as infants in the original parent study V72P12.

## Secondary

a. To explore antibody persistence in 4-year-old children after two catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to toddlers at 12 and 14, 18 and 20, or 24 and 26 months of age in study V72P12E1.

b. To characterize the antibody response to a fifth dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to 4year-old children after a fourth dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ, previously administered to toddlers at 12, 18, or 24 months of age in study V72P12E1.

c. To characterize the antibody response to a third dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to 4year-old children after two catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ, previously administered to toddlers at either 12 and 14, 18 and 20, or 24 and 26 months of age in study V72P12E1.

d. To demonstrate a sufficient immune response to two catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered 2 months apart to naïve 4-year-old children.

## Safety Objectives:

a. To assess the safety and tolerability of a fifth dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to 4-yearold children after fourth dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ previously administered to toddlers at 12, 18, or 24 months of age in V72P12E1 study.

b. To assess the safety and tolerability of a third dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to 4year-old children after two catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ, previously administered to toddlers at either 12 and 14, 18 and 20, or 24 and 26 months of age in V72P12E1 study.

c. To assess the safety and tolerability of two catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered 2 months apart to naïve 4-year-old children.

## Study design

This trial (V72P12E2) is an extension of study V72P12E1. It was conducted as a multicenter study and enrolled approximately 4-year-old subjects, who completed the vaccination course of study V72P12E1 (called follow-on subjects in this report), and who met all other enrollment criteria for this extension study, were eligible to participate. The description of the vaccine groups in this study and their vaccination schedule in the previous extension trial is detailed in Table 2-1.

Note: Groups names as used in original study V72P12E1 - aGroup 1a; bGroup 1b; cGroup 1c; dGroup 2a; eGroup 2b; fGroup 2c; gGroup 3a, hGroup 3b, iGroup 3c. Subjects of B+R246 (12/18/24) and B246 (12/18/24) groups from V72P12E1 were randomized in 2:1 ratio into: Nonvaccination subset #1 and vaccination subset #2.

## Study population /Sample size

## Number of Subjects:

Based on the number of subjects who completed their vaccination course in study V72P12E1, up to a maximum of ~1510 subjects (follow-on groups) were eligible to participate in this extension study. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study centers in Germany and Belgium, which had enrolled 271 and 175 subjects respectively, in the V72P12E1 study, did not participate in this extension study.

A group of approximately 190 newly recruited vaccine naive subjects (B48\\_50 group), of similar age to the follow-on subjects were also planned to be enrolled into the study from the same study centers as the previous study V72P12E1. In total, up to approximately 1700 subjects could be enrolled in this study.

## Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion:

Healthy children, approximately 4 years of age, who participated and completed the vaccination course as toddlers in study V72P12E1 and who met all other enrollment criteria for this extension study, were eligible to participate.

An additional study group (vaccine naive subjects group B48\\_50), consisting of 190 newly recruited, vaccine naive, of similar age to the follow-on subjects (approximately 4 years) were enrolled into the study. These subjects served as a baseline comparator for comparison of antibody persistence with the vaccine-treated groups. The immune response following the first dose also served as a comparator for the booster responses in the vaccine groups.

## Treatments

The investigational vaccine used in this study was the meningococcal B recombinant vaccine formulated with outer membrane vesicles derived from N meningitidis serogroup B strain NZ98/254 (OMV NZ) (rMenB+OMV NZ), (lot number: 112801). The meningococcal B recombinant (rMenB+OMV NZ) vaccine was provided as offwhite opalescent suspension for injection. This vaccine was supplied as a single-dose syringe. It was administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid region.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Immunogenicity Endpoints:

Following are the endpoints for evaluating immunogenicity against N meningitidis serogroup B indicator strains H44/76, 5/99, NZ98/254 and M10713.

For groups with primary vaccination at 2, 4 6 months of age (with [B+R246] or without [B246] concomitant routine vaccinations) and at 2, 3, 4 months of age, [B+R234] (all groups with 4th dose at 12, 18 or 24 Months of age), the persistence of serum bactericidal activity at 4 years of age was assessed by calculating percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 5, hSBA titers ≥ 8, hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs), and geometric mean ratio (GMRs) based on GMTs at 1 month after the last rMenB+OMV NZ booster vaccination (4th dose) in the V72P12E1 study, to each of the 4 indicator strains. All immunogenicity analyses were performed on the full analysis set (FAS)2.

## Secondary:

For groups that received two catch-up doses at either 12, 14 (group B12 14), or 18, 20 (group B18 20) or 24, 26 months of age (group B24 26) the persistence of serum bactericidal activity at 4 years of age was assessed by calculating percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 5, hSBA titers ≥ 8, hSBA GMTs, and GMRs based on GMTs at 1 month after the last rMenB+OMV NZ vaccination in the V72P12E1 study, to each of the 4 indicator strains. All immunogenicity analyses were performed on the FAS population.

For subset#2 of groups B+R246 (12/18/24) and B246 (12/18/24) and for all subjects in B+R234 (12/18/24): induction of bactericidal antibodies at 1 month following a 5th dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccination was characterized by calculating hSBA GMTs, percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 5 and ≥ 8, and 4-fold increase to each of the 4 indicator strains.

For groups that received a two-dose catch-up in V72P12E1, induction of bactericidal antibodies at 1 month following a 3rd dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccination was characterized by calculating SBA GMTs, percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 5 and ≥ 8, and 4-fold increase to each of the 4 indicator strains.

In healthy naïve children of ~4 years of age after a two-dose catch-up, a sufficient immune response of rMenB+OMV NZ was defined as the lower limit of the twosided 95% CI for the percentage of subjects achieving hSBA titers ≥ 5 at 1 month after the two-dose series to be ≥70% for all 3 indicator strains. Analysis on strain M10713 for naive group was descriptive.

Baseline antibody levels measured in vaccine naive subjects at approximately 4 years of age (B48\\_50) served as a descriptive comparator to evaluate antibody persistence at 4 years of age in follow-on subjects from parent study V72P12E1. The immune response following the first dose also served as a comparator for the booster responses in the follow-on groups. The antibody response to catch-up doses at 4 years of age in vaccine naïve subjects also served to gain experience with catch-up immunizations with rMenB+OMV NZ in older age group.

## Safety Endpoints

All subjects who received at least one dose of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine in this study and who provided any postvaccination safety data were included in the safety and tolerability analyses. All safety analyses were descriptive.

## Solicited local and systemic adverse events:

Incidences of solicited local adverse events (AEs) (i.e., pain, erythema, induration, swelling) and systemic AEs (i.e., fever [defined as axillary temperature ≥ 38.0 °C], change in eating habits, sleepiness, vomiting, diarrhea, irritability, headache, arthralgia, and rash) occurring during the 7 days following each study vaccination were summarized by maximal severity and study group.

Erythema, induration and swelling were categorized as none, 0 to &lt; 10 mm, 10 to &lt; 25 mm, 25 to &lt; 50 mm, 50 to &lt; 100 mm and ≥ 100 mm. Temperature was taken by the axillary route and was analyzed in 0.5 °C increments as follows: &lt; 38.0°C (no fever), 38.0 - 38.4°C, 38.5°C - 38.9°C, 39.0°C - 39.4°C, 39.5°C - 39.9°C, ≥ 40.0°C. All other systemic AEs were categorized as mild, moderate or severe.

Additionally, the numbers of subjects who used antipyretic medication (prophylactically or therapeutically) within 7 days of study vaccination were summarized.

## Unsolicited Adverse Events

All AEs occurring during the 7 days following each study vaccination were collected. Medically attended fever was also specifically collected during this time period. Serious adverse events (SAEs) as well as AEs that require a medical visit and/or result in premature withdrawal from the study were collected throughout the study period.

## Statistical Methods

Immunogenicity : The primary analysis population for immunogenicity analysis is the full analysis set (FAS). Immunogenicity was evaluated for persistence, booster response and for immunogenicity after two catch-up doses in 4-year-old vaccine naïve subjects.

The percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 5 and ≥ 8 and associated two-sided 95% ClopperPearson confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for follow-on groups and vaccine naive group (B48\\_50). In addition, differences in percentages and 95% CIs between follow-on groups vaccine naive group were also calculated for persistence and booster analysis.

All GMTs and associated 95% CIs were computed per group and per strain. For each vaccine group, adjusted GMTs and their 95% CIs were obtained by exponentiating (base 10) the least square means and the lower and upper limits of the 95% CIs of the log transformed or concentrations (base 10). These were obtained from a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with factors for vaccine and study country. Additionally, GMT ratios of follow-on groups to vaccine naive subjects (group B48\\_50) were computed. Further, 95% CIs for the ratios of GMTs were constructed by exponentiating the difference of the least square means of the log transformed titers and the lower and upper limits of the 95% CIs.

The percentage of subjects achieving 4-fold rise over baseline were calculated after 3 rd or 5 th dose boost in follow-on subjects and after first and second dose in vaccine naïve subjects.

## Safety :

Solicited local and systemic adverse events : Frequencies and percentages of subjects experiencing each AE are presented for each symptom severity. Summary tables showing the occurrence of any local or systemic AE overall and at each time point are also presented.

Unsolicited adverse events : The original verbatim terms used by investigators to identify AEs in the case report forms (CRFs) were mapped to preferred terms using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The AEs were then grouped by MedDRA preferred terms into frequency tables according to system organ class. All reported AEs, as well as AEs judged by the investigator as at least possibly related to study vaccine, are summarized according to system organ class and preferred term within system organ class. These summaries are presented by vaccination group.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 242 follow-on subjects from groups B+R246 (12/18/24; N=38+ 41+ 43) and B246 (12/18/24; N=47+36+37) from V72P12E1 study were assigned to nonvaccination subset 1 in this extension study V72P12E2 for persistence analysis only. All subjects enrolled in the nonvaccination subset 1 completed the study.

A total of 563 subjects were enrolled in the extension study V72P12E2 (Table 10.1-2).

## Immunogenicity results

## Antibody Persistence at 4 Years of Age

Antibody persistence was explored in 2 main groups of subjects in study V72P12E2:

Subjects who had received a 3-dose primary series of rMenB+OMV NZ at 2, 3, 4 or 2, 4, 6 months of age in parent study V72P12, followed by a 4 th dose boost at 12, 18 or 24 months of age in 1 st extension study V72P12E1 (groups B+R246 12, B+R246 18, B+R246 24, B+R246 12\\_48, B+R246 18\\_48, B+R246 24\\_48, B246 12, B246 18, B246 24, B246 12\\_48, B246 18\\_48, B246 24\\_48, B+R234 12\\_48, B+R234 18\\_48, and B+R234 24\\_48; see Table 2.5.4.2-1) (Primary objective).

Subjects who had received 2 catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ at 12 and 14, 18 and 20, or 24 and 26 months of age in  1 st  extension study V72P12E1 (groups B12 14\\_48, B18 20\\_48, and B24 26\\_48; see Table 2.5.4.2-2) (Secondary objective).

Assessor's comment: The antibody persistence data show that for strain 5/99 most subjects have remaining titres, wile for strainsNZ98/254 (OMV) and H44/76 (fHBP) the seropositivity rates have declined substantially. The results for strain M10713 are similar to what has been seen in other studies, i.e. the baseline titres are very high, making it more difficult to interpret results.

The results for the 3-dose primed groups and the 2-dose catch-up groups were overall similar. For the catch-up groups the confidence intervals were wide in the smaller groups.

Assessor's comment: The responses to a single booster dose resulted in higher proportions of responders in the previously primed groups, regardless of schedule, compared to the previously naïve children. These results indicate that all priming schedules induce immunological memory. The results for strain M10713 are more difficult to interpret, due to a high proportion of seropositive subjects prevaccination.

## Safety results

## Solicited Local and Systemic AEs

Incidences of solicited local AEs and systemic AEs occurring during the 7 days following each study vaccination were summarized by maximal severity and study group.  Additionally, the numbers of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects who used antipyretic medication (prophylactically or therapeutically) and those who experienced medically attended fever within 7 days of study vaccination were summarized.

## Local and Systemic AEs Following a 5 th  Dose Boost of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 Years of Age

Across all study groups, most subjects who received a 5 th  dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 years of age reported at least 1 solicited local or systemic AEs during the first 7 days (90% to 100%). Across study groups, 84% to 100% of subjects reported solicited local AEs and 70% to 95% of subjects reported solicited systemic AEs.

The most commonly reported solicited local AE across groups was injection site pain, and severe intensity of injection site pain ranged from 11% to 32% (Table 2.5.5.2-1).

The most commonly reported solicited systemic AE across study groups was irritability and severe intensity ranged from 0% to 12% of subjects. Other commonly reported systemic AEs were sleepiness, change in eating habits and arthralgia (Table 2.5.5.2-1).

Across study groups percentages of subjects reporting fever ranged from 4% to 21% of subjects. One subject from group B+R234 12\\_48 reported a temperature ≥ 40°C. Medically attended fever was reported in 2 subjects from group B+R246 12\\_48 and in 1 subject from group B+R234 12\\_48 (Table 2.5.5.2-1).

Assessor's comment: The reactogenicity of Bexsero is in agreement with previously reported results. The rates of adverse events are high compared to many other vaccines. The fever rates in this age group appear to be somewhat lower compared to the fever rates in infants.

## Local and Systemic AEs Following a 3 rd  Dose Boost of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 Years of Age

The majority of subjects in study groups that received a 3 rd  dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 years of age reported at least 1 solicited AE during the first 7 days postvaccination (90% to 100%). Across study groups, 90% to 95% of subjects reported solicited local AEs and 60% to 79% of subjects reported solicited systemic AEs.

The most commonly reported solicited local AE across study groups was injection site pain and severe intensity was reported in 8% to 19% of subjects. Severe intensity of erythema and induration was reported in 2% and 1% of subjects, respectively, from the study group B12 14\\_48 (Table 2.5.5.2-2).

Most commonly reported solicited systemic AE across study groups was irritability and severe intensity was reported by 6% of subjects from the study group B12 14\\_48. Other commonly reported systemic AEs were sleepiness, change in eating habits (0%-42%), arthralgia and headache (Table 2.5.5.2-2).

Percentages of subjects reporting fever across study groups ranged from 16% to 42% of subjects. None of the subjects reported fever ≥40°C. Medically attended fever was reported in 2 subjects from group B12 14\\_48 and 1 subject from group B18 20\\_48 (Table 2.5.5.2-2).

## Local and Systemic AEs Following Two Catch-up Doses of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 Years of Age

The majority of subjects in group B48\\_50 that received 2 catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ 2 months apart at 4 years of age reported at least 1 solicited AE during the first 7 days after any vaccination (97%). Most subjects (94%) reported solicited local AEs and 78% of subjects reported solicited systemic AEs.

The most commonly reported solicited local AE was injection site pain. Severe intensity of pain was reported in 13% and 11% of subjects post-1st and -2nd vaccination, respectively. (Table 2.5.5.2-3).

Most commonly reported solicited systemic AE was sleepiness, with severe intensity reported in 2% and 1% of subjects post-1st and 2nd vaccination, respectively. Other commonly reported systemic AEs were irritability, change in eating habits and arthralgia (Table 2.5.5.2-3).

Percentages of subjects reporting fever in study group B48\\_50 post-1st and 2nd vaccination were 10% and 8% of subjects, respectively. Two subjects reported temperature ≥ 40°C post-1st vaccination. Medically attended fever was reported in 2 subjects post-1st vaccination and 4 subjects post-2nd vaccination (Table 2.5.5.2-3).

Assessor's comment: The AEs reporting is genereally in agreement in the previously unvaccinated group compared to the previously primed groups.

## Unsolicited AEs Following a 5 th  Dose Boost of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 Years of Age

Percentages of subjects with any and possibly or probably related unsolicited AEs during the first 7 days following a 5 th  dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 years of age both ranged from 0% to 37% across study groups.

Unsolicited AEs from day 1 to 7 were reported most commonly in the system organ class (SOC) 'General disorders and administration site conditions'. Most of these were solicited AEs continuing past 7 days after vaccination and were considered possibly or probably related to the study vaccination.

Percentages of subjects with any unsolicited AEs from day 1 through study termination following a 5 th dose of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 years of age ranged from 18% to 38%, and possibly or probably related AEs ranged from 0% to 37% across groups (Table 2.5.5.3-1).

Injection site induration was the most commonly reported unsolicited AE from day 1 through study termination, reported in 2% to11% of subjects. All of these were considered possibly or probably related to the study vaccination.

None of the subjects reported SAEs or AEs leading to withdrawal or death from day 1 through study termination (Table 2.5.5.3-1).

## Unsolicited AEs Following a 3 rd  Dose Boost of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 Years of Age

Percentages of subjects with any unsolicited AEs during the first 7 days following a 3 rd dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 years of age ranged from 9% to 25% and possibly or probably related AEs ranged from 8% to 17% across study groups.

Unsolicited AEs from day 1 to 7 were reported most commonly (7% to 17% of subjects, none reported in B18 20\\_48) in the SOC 'General disorders and administration site conditions'. Possibly or probably related AEs were reported in 6% and 8% of subjects in these groups. In group B18 20\\_48 unsolicited AEs were most commonly (9%) in the SOC 'Infections and infestations'; all of these were considered possibly related to the study vaccination.

Percentages of subjects with any unsolicited AEs from day 1 through study termination following a 3 rd dose of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 years of age ranged from 18% to 33%, and possibly or probably related AEs ranged from 8% to 17% across groups (Table 2.5.5.3-2).

Pyrexia was the most commonly reported unsolicited AE from day 1 through study termination, reported in 3% to17% of subjects across all 3 groups. One subject (group B24 26\\_48) reported possibly related pyrexia.

None of the subjects reported SAEs or AEs leading to withdrawal or death from day 1 through study termination (Table 2.5.5.3-2).

## Unsolicited AEs Following Two Catch-up Doses of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 Years of Age

Following any vaccination at 4 years of age in group B48\\_50, the percentage of subjects with any unsolicited AE during the first 7 days was 29% and possibly or probably related AEs were reported by 15% of subjects.

Unsolicited AEs from day 1 to 7 were reported most commonly (10% of subjects) in the SOC 'General disorders and administration site conditions' and 'infections and infestations' after any vaccination. Nearly all of the general disorders and administration site conditions and 1% of reported infections and infestations were considered possibly or probably related to study vaccine.

One subject (467017) reported an SAE, gastroenteritis of moderate intensity on day 67 (7 days post2 nd vaccination at 4 years of age). The event was considered not related to the study vaccination. One subject (017006) was withdrawn from study due to an AE (injection site pain of moderate intensity). The event was considered probably related to the study vaccination.

Percentage of subjects with any unsolicited AEs from day 1 through study termination following any vaccination at 4 years of age in study group B48\\_50 was 51% and possibly or probably related AEs were reported by 15% of subjects (Table 2.5.5.3-3).

The most commonly reported unsolicited AEs following any vaccination with rMenB+OMV NZ in study group B48\\_50 were injection site induration; cough and bronchitis reported in 6% 5% and 4% of subjects respectively. All cases with injection site induration were possibly or probably related to study vaccination (Table 12.2.3-9).

Serious adverse events were reported by 3 subjects (1%) after any vaccination from day 1 through study termination. Subject 017025 reported infectious croup, subject 105013 reported concussion, contusion and periorbital haematoma and subject 467017 reported gastroenteritis and dehydration. All these events were considered not related to the study vaccination. As reported earlier, one subject

Assessor's comment: No new safety signal was detected from the unsolicited AEs reporting.

## Discussion on clinical aspects

These data represent the longest persistence data presented so far in children with a sample size that allows conclusions for most groups. As discussed earlier, the waning antibody titres and seropositivity are of concern for two of the antigens, the OMV and fHBP. The respective roles of persisting antibodies and immunological memory are not fully understood, and the clinical relevance of the waning titres is unclear. It could be discussed whether the persistence data should be included in the SPC, for increased transparency of the data. Considering that the relevance of waning titres to two out of four antigens, in the presence of immunological memory is unclear it is doubtful that this will be of any assistance to the prescribers. Thus, a detailed description of the data is not warranted in the SPC, but a brief description of the persistence data could be useful. The MAH is asked to discuss the need relevance of these findings, together with other persistence data. Considering the limited time since approval, and that the vaccine is only beginning to be used on a larger scale, it is unlikely that effectiveness data from post-marketing experience is available yet.

## MAH Response

Novartis acknowledges that persistence data from study V72P12E2 show a decline in antibodies against strains NZ98/254 (OMV) and H44/76 (fHbp) in previously primed children 4 years of age. Antibody decline after a primary vaccination course is a common feature of the response to infant vaccines irrespective of the priming schedule. Nevertheless, immunological measurements are surrogates and only indirectly relate to protection. Exposure to the organism (or to a booster dose of the vaccine) induces anamnestic antibody responses in most subjects primed as infants even though prechallenge antibodies may have dwindled demonstrating evidence the vaccine induced immune memory. (see Plotkin, 2008).

Indeed, the responses to a single booster dose in study V72P12E2 resulted in high percentages of subjects achieving protective levels of bactericidal antibodies (hSBA ≥ 1:5) against all 4 indicator strains irrespective of the priming schedule. In particular against the NZ98/254 and H44/76 antigens, for which the antibody titers declined the most, response to booster vaccination was high (and similar to or even higher than responses seen after the 3-dose primary vaccination course (parent study V72P12) and after the 4th dose boost (first extension study V72P12E1)). In addition, the responses to a booster dose elicited much higher antibody levels in previously primed children compared with antibody levels observed in age-matched vaccine naïve children after one dose of rMenB+OMV NZ.

Moreover, bactericidal antibodies against PorA P1.4 and fHbp, and the persistence of antibodies to these antigens will not be the sole predictors of protective activity, as bactericidal activity against other vaccine antigens will also contribute to protection. The likelihood that the vaccine is not protective is thought to be reduced when bactericidal antibodies induced by vaccination are targeting multiple antigens on the surface of the meningococcus.

Antibodies to multiple antigens may act synergistically to enhance bactericidal activity thus underestimating the true protective activity of the vaccine-induced antibodies. For example, there are data indicating that antibodies to NHBA and fHbp can cooperate resulting in enhanced bactericidal activity (Vu et al. 2011). In addition, Donnelly and colleagues have shown that strains are killed more efficiently when targeted by antibodies against two or more antigens (Donnelly et al. 2010).

The observation that a booster dose at 4 years of age restores hSBA ≥ 1:5 percentages to high values suggest powerful anamnestic responses to all 4 indicator strains in children that have been primed as infants and received a 4th dose boost as toddlers as per recommendation in the SmPC, irrespective of the persisting levels of antibodies against the respective strains present at 4 years of age. Together with the argument that bactericidal activity against all 4 indicator strains contribute to protection, and that antibodies to multiple antigens may act synergistically, the relevance of waning titers to 2 out of 4 antigens is unclear.

Based on the above, Novartis agrees with the assessment of the Rapporteur that it is doubtful whether inclusion of additional information regarding persistence of antibodies will be of any assistance to the prescribers and therefore suggests not to include it in the SmPC.

## Additional note on safety data from study V72P12E2

Upon review of the data from this study Novartis identified two adverse reactions, headache and arthralgia, that were reported by ≥ 10% of subjects approximately 4 years of age regardless of previous vaccination schedule.

These adverse reactions are not considered a new signal for identified or potential risks that require an update of the Risk Management Plan for rMenB+OMV NZ because they do not impact the positive

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

benefit-risk profile of the vaccine, as stated in section 2.5.6 of the addendum to the Clinical Overview submitted in support of study V72P12E2 under Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation.

However, these reactions are currently not listed for children in the relevant age group in the SmPC of rMenB+OMV NZ and based on the data from study V72P12E2 Novartis considers their addition to the SmPC warranted.

Novartis will follow the appropriate procedure to implement these changes to the SmPC.

Assessment: The MAH has provided a discussion on the relevance of the waning antibody titres. The discussion is based on similar arguments as were provided during the approval process. In conclusion, the relevance of waning antibody titres is not known, and whether immunological memory is sufficient to protect can only be speculated on. Likewise, the vaccine composition, i.e. multiple antigens, may reduce the importance of sustained antibody levels to all antigens, but again the relevance is unknown. Therefore, a sentence should be added to section 5.1 of the SPC, stating that antibody levels to the OMV and fHbp antigens have waned at four years of age in children fully vaccinated with a 3+1 vaccination schedule, although the presence of immunological memory is considered demonstrated, and the relevance of this is currently unknown.

The proposed update of section 4.8 is agreed.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The commitment is considered fulfilled, by the submission of the full clinical study report, and the response to the question. However, a SPC change is considered necessary for full transparency of the data. Section 5.1 should include a statement that antibody levels to the OMV and fHbp antigens have waned at four years of age in children fully vaccinated with a 3+1 vaccination schedule, although the presence of immunological memory is considered demonstrated, and the relevance of this is currently unknown, and section 4.8 should be updated according to the MAH suggestion above.
