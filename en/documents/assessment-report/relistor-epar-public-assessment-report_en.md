## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Opioid  analgesics  are  commonly  administered  for  moderate  to  severe  pain  in  a  multiplicity  of disorders.  They  are,  however,  consistently  associated  with  a  spectrum  of  debilitating  side  effects, including constipation, abdominal pain, discomfort, bloating, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, and pruritus. Chronic constipation is observed in 40-70% of these patients.

Opioids cause constipation by maintaining or increasing intestinal smooth  muscle  tone, by suppressing forward peristalsis, by raising sphincter tone at the ileocaecal valve and anal sphincter, and  by  reducing  sensitivity  to  rectal  distension.  Moreover,  secretion  and  blood  flow  are  also negatively influenced.

In patients in palliative care, with life threatening disease, the constipation caused by opioids may be altered and exacerbated by factors related to the underlying malignant or other concomitant disease, such  as  metabolic  alterations  (diabetes,  hypercalcemia,  hypokaliemia,  uremia,  hypothyroidism), dehydration, advanced age, reduced physical activity or immobility, low fluid and/or low dietary fiber intake, mechanical obstruction, neurological disorders, and concomitant medication such as antiemetics, diuretics, anticonvulsants, vinca alkaloids, and others. Moreover, and contrary to other side effects of opioids, patients very rarely develop tolerance to the constipating effects of opioids.

Complications  associated  with  uncontrolled  constipation  include  faecal  impaction  and  spurious diarrhoea, pseudo-obstruction of the bowel with the symptoms abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting and interference with drug administration and absorption.

Efficacy of conventional laxatives in opioid induced constipation has not been fully established and only  small  prospective  studies  are  available  with  some  of  the  substances  used  in  the  setting. Commonly, recommendations for the treatment of opioid-related constipation have been made on the basis  of  personal  experience  and  clinical  observations.  Recommendations  usually  comprise  nonpharmacologic strategies, such as increasing dietary fibre and fluid intake, which are, however, very rarely sufficient for constipation control in opioid related constipation.

A variety of pharmacologic treatments representing the whole range of different substance classes in the treatment of obstipation is recommended. However, treatment failure appears to be common, and rescue medication, such as enemas and other measures (including digital removal of faeces) have to be used.

Considering that the activation of µ-opioid receptors in the gastro-intestinal tract is responsible for inhibition  of  gut  motility,  whereas  receptors  in  the  central  nervous  system  mediate  the  analgesic action of opioid, the use of peripheral µ-opioid receptor antagonist could be of benefit to the patients.

Wyeth Europa Limited submitted through the Centralised Procedure ( Art. 3 (2) (a)) , a 'stand-alone' application  for  methylnaltrexone,  a  new  chemical  entity  for  the  following  claimed  indication: 'treatment of opioid induced constipation in patients with advanced illness'.

RELISTOR (INN: methylnaltrexone bromide) is a quaternary derivative of the µ -opioid antagonist, naltrexone.  Whereas  naltrexone  is  used  to  counteract  the  CNS  related  effects  of  opioid  treatment (including  overdose),  RELISTOR  was  designed  to  potentially  block  the  undesired  peripheral  side effects of opioids without interfering the central analgesic effects.

The  application  is  for  an  aqueous  solution  for  injection  administered  subcutaneously  containing 12mg/0.6ml per vial (equivalent to 20mg/ml) of methylnaltrexone bromide.

The  product  is  to  be  administered  with  daily  doses  of  8  mg  or  12  mg  according  to  body  weight (threshold: 61kg), by means of a single injection which should not be exceeded on a daily basis and which should be administered on an 'as needed' basis on top of usual laxative treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A comparable treatment has not been approved within the EU via centralised procedure. However, several  products  have  been  approved  (nationally)  with  the µ -antagonist  naloxone  in  oral  fixed combination  products  (e.g.  tilidin/naloxone  and  oxycodone/naloxone),  meant  to  reduce  opioid induced side effects, especially opioid induced constipation.

No  regulatory  guidance  is  available  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  or  in  the  United  States  (US) concerning the clinical development of products intended for use in opioid induced constipation.

The applicant did not request central Scientific Advice from the Scientific Advice Working Party for the  non-clinical  or  clinical  aspects  of  the  development  programme  in  the  claimed  indication. However, Scientific  Advice  was  requested  for  the  overall  pharmaceutical  part  of  the  development, and for the clinical development in the indication 'post-operative ileus'. In addition, meetings with several  European  National  Competent  Authorities  (i.e.  BfArM,  Germany,  the  MHRA,  UK,  the AFSSAPS, France,  and  the  MPA,  Sweden)  and  with  the  FDA  were  conducted  between  2003  and 2007 in the indication relating to this application.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

RELISTOR  is  a  solution  for  injection  containing  12  mg/0.6  mL  of  methylnaltrexone  bromide (MNTX) per vial (equivalent to 20mg/mL) for subcutaneous administration. An overfill of 0.2mL is used in order to provide a withdrawable volume of 0.6mL. RELISTOR solution for injection is a clear solution, colourless to pale-yellow, essentially free from visible particulates supplied in clear Type I flint glass vial, gray butyl rubber stopper and aluminium overseal with flip off-cap.

The excipients used in the preparation of RELISTOR are sodium chloride, sodium calcium edetate, glycine hydrochloride, hydrochloric acid (to adjust pH), sodium hydroxide (to adjust pH) and water for injections.

## Active Substance

Methylnaltrexone  bromide  is  a  new  chemical  entity  designated  as  ( R )-N - (cyclopropylmethyl) noroxymorphone methobromide. The structure of MNTX is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Chemical structure of MNTX

<!-- image -->

Methylnaltrexone  bromide  is  a  quaternary  derivative  of  the  opioid  antagonist  naltrexone.    The addition of a methyl group resulted in a compound with greater polarity and lower lipid solubility, with  reduced  permeation  through  the  blood-brain  barrier  and  consequently,  restricted  access  to  the brain. The Active Substance Master File (ASMF) procedure was followed for the active substance.

Methylnaltrexone  bromide  is  a  white  to  off-white  crystalline  powder,  soluble  in  water,  nonhygroscopic, with a melting point of 251 o C and a pH of approximately 4.6. Its octanol/water partition coefficient (log P) is of -1.12.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Manufacture

MTNX is  manufactured  by  a  synthetic  process.  Details  on  the  manufacturing  process,  control  of materials, critical steps, process controls, and process validation were provided in the restricted part of the Active Substance Master File.

The structure of MNTX has been confirmed by FTIR, 1 H NMR,  13 C NMR and MS. The NMR results confirmed the R configuration for the quaternary nitrogen. Particle size distribution was analysed by laser diffraction and polymorphism was investigated by X-ray powder diffraction.

## · Specification

The active substance specifications include tests for appearance, identification (IR and HPLC), assay (HPLC), pH, water content (Karl Fischer), residue on ignition, loss on drying, heavy metals, specific rotation, bromide content, residual solvents (GC and HPLC), related substances (HPLC), microbial limits and bacterial endotoxins.

The  IR  method  was  validated  for  specificity.  The  HPLC  and  GC  methods  were  validated  for specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, limit of detection and limit of quantitation.  No validation was performed for the methods described in the PhEur.

Data was provided on 16 batches representative of the  commercial manufacturing process. All the batch data complied with the specifications of the active substance. The results demonstrated that the active substance can be consistently manufactured by the proposed manufacturing process.

## · Stability

Stability studies were performed on several commercial size batches of MNTX stored in the proposed packaging at accelerated conditions (40 o C/75% RH) for up to six months and long term conditions (25 o C/60% RH) for up to four years.  The results support the proposed re-test period.

## Medicinal Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

A solution for injection for subcutaneous use was chosen as the pharmaceutical form, since it is most favourable to the patient's needs.

The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a formulation that could be stored at room temperature. This was achieved by optimizing primary packaging and the formulation.

Aseptic processing and sterile filtration was chosen as the preferred method of sterilisation.

- Adventitious Agents

None of the excipients used in the formulation of MNTX solution for injection are of human or animal origin.

## · Manufacture of the Product

A conventional manufacturing process was used, consisting of compounding, sterile filtration and aseptic processing.

There are several in-process controls such as the determination of the pH prior to the addition of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide, determination of the bioburden prior to filtration, testing of the integrity of the sterilising filter pre and post filtration and check of the fill weight at startup and throughout the filling operation.

The manufacturing process and in-process controls were adequately described and validated in line with ICH guidelines.

Batch analysis data was provided on three batches. The data confirmed that the MNTX solution for injection can be manufactured reproducibly according to the finished product specifications.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Product Specification

The specifications for MNTX solution for injection include tests for appearance and description (visual inspection), identification of MNTX (HPLC and UV), identification and assay of sodium calcium edetate (HPLC), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), pH, volume in container, particulate matter, bacterial endotoxins, sterility and osmolality.

All methods have been satisfactory validated. The HPLC methods have been validated for specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy, robustness and solution stability. The endotoxins and sterility were also validated for MNTX solution for injection.

- Stability of the Product

Stability data was provided on three commercial scale batches manufactured by the proposed manufacturing site for the finished product. The batches were stored at 25 o C/60% RH (long term conditions), 30 o C/75% RH (intermediate conditions) for 12 months and at 40 o C/75% RH (accelerated conditions) for 6 months, in the proposed container closure system. The parameters assessed were appearance and description, strength, purity and related substances, content of sodium calcium edetate and pH. The results in all studies complied with the product specifications in all batches.

Photostability studies were performed on one batch of MNTX solution for injection according to ICH option 2 light conditions on both packaged and exposed finished product. The results showed that the product is highly sensitive to light exposure, but stable when protected from light in the secondary packaging.

In conclusion, the stability results support the shelf life and storage conditions as described in the SPC.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The finished product was developed as a solution for injection for subcutaneous use. The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain a stable product at room temperature. This was achieved by optimizing the primary packaging and the formulation. A conventional manufacturing process was used, consisting of compounding, sterile filtration and aseptic processing.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

MNTX has been used as an investigational drug in the scientific  community for far more than 20 years. Besides one receptor screen study, the safety pharmacology studies and the toxicity studies, all pharmacology data were not based on Company-initiated studies but were retrieved from published papers.

Preclinical  safety  studies  and  the  majority  of  the  toxicity  and  pharmacokinetics  studies  were performed  according  to  GLP  standards.  Data  described  in  the  sections  on  primary  and  secondary pharmacodynamics and on pharmacodynamic drug interactions were mainly derived from published literature and did not meet GLP-standards.

## Pharmacology

## · Primary pharmacodynamics ( in vitro/in vivo )

MNTX  acts  as  an  antagonist  preferentially  at  the  mu-opioid  receptor  (Ki=28  nM),  exhibits  less potency at the kappa-receptor and shows no action at the delta-opioid receptor or at any other receptor investigated  in  a  broad  screen.  The  methylation  in  MNTX  causes  greater  polarity  and  lower  lipid solubility  of  the  molecule,  and  hence,  MNTX is restricted from crossing the blood-brain barrier in animals  and  in  humans  at  clinically  relevant  doses.  MNTX  is  intended  for  application  via  the  s.c. route, and therefore its action is expected to be restricted to the periphery.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In several species it has been demonstrated ex vivo (guinea pig, horse, human) and in vivo (mouse, rat, dog,  horse)  that  MNTX  effectively  antagonises  (in  case  of  the in  vivo data  after  peripheral administration as intended for clinical use) the opioid-induced inhibition of gastrointestinal function. Typical  effective  s.c.  doses  in  these  studies  were  about  1  to  30mg/kg.  Opioid-induced  analgesia,  a centrally mediated effect, was generally not affected after peripheral MNTX administration in several species (mouse, rat, guinea pig). In the mouse and in the rat opioid-induced analgesia was diminished at  MNTX concentrations of about 100-fold the human dose. This is in line with the concept of demethylation of MNTX to the centrally easily passable NTX in rodents, a metabolic reaction shown to be essentially absent in humans.

The R-isomer of MNTX has been developed for use, due to its mu-opioid receptor antagonism, as opposed  to  the  weak  agonist  effect  of  the  S-isomer.  Chiral  conversion  was  considered  unlikely  to occur as the quaternary nitrogen of MNTX is constrained in a cyclic system and lacks an unshared pair of electrons. Consequently, chiral conversion will have no implications for efficacy and safety of the product.

MNTX  administered  peripherally  was  shown  to  be  devoid  of  withdrawal-precipitating  actions  in morphine  (MO)-dependent  in  dogs  (50  mg/kg  s.c.)  and  rhesus  monkeys  (32  mg/kg  s.c.),  and  was ineffective in blocking discriminative effects in monkeys (10 mg/kg i.m.) trained to discriminate the opioid  etorphine  from  saline.  In  line  with  the  known  metabolic  conversion  of  MNTX  to  NTX  in rodents, MNTX precipitated only very weak withdrawal-signs in MO-dependent mice.

Peripherally administered MNTX was active in counteracting MO-induced emesis in dogs and picabehaviour (a phenomenon consisting of consumption of non-nutritive substances) in rats, a species which lacks the motor response to emetic stimuli.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

The  reported  secondary  pharmacology  studies  supported  the  opioid-antagonist  activity  of  MNTX, with central effects generally occuring only when MNTX is administered intracerebroventricularly. Other  routes  of  administration  appeared  to  restrict  the  action  to  peripheral  sites,  although  some reversal  of  morphine-induced  analgesia  was  seen  in  mice  and  rats,  suggesting  that  either  small quantities of MNTX can cross the blood-brain barrier in these species, or that MNTX is converted to naltrexone, which is able to enter the CNS.

## · Safety pharmacology

The  applicant  performed  1  study  to  investigate  neuropharmacological  effects  in  mice,  a  total  of  7 studies investigating cardiovascular effects (including 2 studies employing cloned hERG channels and 2 studies measuring effects on action potentials in isolated rabbit and dog cardiac Purkinje fibers), 1 gastrointestinal propulsion assay in rats, 1 study investigating pulmonary effects in guinea pigs and 1 study on renal effects in rats.

MNTX had no effect on CNS in mice, on the GI system in rats or on the respiratory system in guinea pigs when administered i.v. at doses of 1, 4 or 16mg/kg. Intravenous doses of 1, 5, or 20mg/kg had no effect on renal function in rats.

Electrophysiological  hERG  channel  recordings, in-vitro APD  measurements  of  rabbit  cardiac Purkinje  fibers  and  ECG  tracings  in  guinea  pigs  indicated  a  very  low  torsadogenic  potential  of MNTX, whereas APD prolongation in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers was observed at concentrations ( ≥ 1 µ M) not markedly higher than the therapeutically intended effective free serum concentration in humans (about 0.28 µ M). No explanation for the MNTX-induced APD prolongation in the canine Purkinje fiber was provided. Effects on IKr, IKs, and INa did not appear to be involved in the observed APD  prolongation.  Hence,  the  effects  of  MNTX  were  further  investigated  in  humans  (see  the 'Clinical aspects' section 3.4).

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Preclinical studies investigating pharmacodynamic drug interactions with concurrently administered laxatives, a combination which is stated in the intended indication, were not performed in animals. However,  in  the  main  clinical  studies  nearly  all  patients  were  administered  conventional  laxatives

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concurrently  with  MNTX.  As  a  result,  there  was  no  need  for  further  preclinical  animal  studies investigating pharmacodynamic interactions between conventional laxatives and MNTX.

Taken  together  the  preclinical  data  on  pharmacology  supported  the  use  of  MNTX  in  the  intended indication in humans.

## Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetics  of  MNTX  was  studied  in  mice,  rats,  and  dogs  after  subcutaneous,  oral  and intravenous  dosing.  Distribution  was  investigated  in  rats  and  rabbits  after  epidural  (rabbits), intravenous  (rats),  and  intraperitoneal  (rats)  dosing.  Protein  binding  was  studied  in  rats,  dogs,  and human plasma. Metabolism was studied in rats (s.c., i.v., and oral), mice (oral), dogs (oral, i.v.) and in various hepatic preparations. Inhibitory and induction effects on cytochrom isoforms was investigated in vitro in  human liver microsomes and cultured hepatocytes. Excretion was studied in vivo in rats, mice,  and  dogs  and  isolated  perfused  kidneys  and  in  human  transport  proteins  expressing  oocytes. Biliary excretion was investigated in bile duct-cannulated rats.

## Methods of analysis

MNTX was detected and quantified by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) (in rat brain and serum) with electrochemical detection, or by liquid chromatography-tandem-mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) (in all other cases).

## · Absorption

MNTX was administered to male rats intravenously, subcutaneously and via gavage. MNTX showed a  moderate  to  high  plasma  clearance  compared  to  liver  blood  flow  and  a  moderate  volume  of distribution  compared to body water. Bioavailability was essentially complete after s.c. dosing and very low (&lt;1%) after oral administration. This was consistent with results obtained in Caco-2 cells, which predicted a low GI uptake. The half-life (t1/2) ranged between 6 to 18 hours (i.v.), or 6 to 10 hours (s.c.), and 2 to 16 hours (oral).

## · Distribution

The tissue distribution study after i.v. administration in rats showed that the highest concentration of MNTX in tissue was reached within 1 hour (in the small intestine, liver and kidney with the highest, and  in  the  brain  with  the  lowest  concentration).  Afterwards  the  concentration  in  most  tissues decreased, although the tissue-to-plasma ratios increased for 12 hours, indicating much faster plasma than tissue clearance. High tissue-to-plasma ratios were observed in thyroid, brown fat, heart, testes, eyes and peritoneal fat after 24 and 120 hours. The studies on brain uptake showed a marginal uptake of  MNTX into the brain of mammals, (as already shown for other tissues) with a slower clearance compared to plasma. Metabolites including naltrexone were detected in the brain.

Protein binding of several concentrations of MNTX was estimated in rats, dogs and human plasma and ranged between 0.4 to 13.3 % indicating minimal binding of MNTX to plasma proteins.

## · Metabolism ( in vitro/in vivo )

In  vivo metabolism of MNTX was investigated in rats, dogs, mice, and human. In rats, unchanged MNTX was  the  main  compound  in  plasma  and  MNTX  glucuronide  and  sulphate  were  the  main metabolites after IV and solely the glucuronide after oral administration. In mice, MNTX was found to  be  the  main  compound  in  plasma  after  oral  administration.  Several  minor  metabolites  including MNTX glucuronide  were  identified.  In  humans  MNTX  was  moderately  metabolised  with  MNTX sulphate (4.1%) and methyl-6-naltrexol isomers (17.7 % of total MNTX) being the major metabolites. Thus, demethylation of MNTX to naltrexone is not a significant metabolic pathway in humans.

In  vitro metabolism  studies  in  several  systems  indicated  MNTX  metabolism  by  hydroxylation, glucuronidation,  methylation  and  glutathione  (only  in  rats)  conjugation.    MNTX  was  moderately metabolised in mice and rats, minimally in dogs and in human hepatocyte systems. MNTX was stable in human and rat liver microsome systems, whereas a minimal metabolism was detected in dogs. In humans,  sulphation  and  reduction  to  methyl-6-naltrexol  isomers  were  the  main  pathways.  In  all species investigated metabolism was limited, with the main compound in excreta being MNTX. Rat and  dog  were  considered  to  be  appropriate  species  for  the  toxicology  studies.  N-demethylation  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

naltrexone  occurred  to  a  limited  extent,  but  was  greater  in  rats  and  mice  than  in  dogs,  and  was negligible in humans.

MNTX was stable when incubated with human CYP isoforms. With the exception of CYP2D6 (Ki 7.9 µ mol/l), no competitive inhibition of the CYP enzymes was found. It was concluded that it is not likely that a clinically relevant inhibition may appear after regular SC doses of MNTX. MNTX did not induce any CYP isoforms in humans. Test systems for glucuronidation showed similar effects as in vivo experiments.

## · Excretion

MNTX was excreted via faeces and urine in all species after oral and systemic application. Studies in bile duct-cannulated  animals  as  well  as  studies  with  intravenous  administration  allowed  the conclusion that MNTX is excreted biliary and via secretion into the gastro intestinal tract.

MNTX is actively secreted into the urine. In line with the results from several clinical studies, the clearance was higher than the glomerular filtration rate in externally perfused kidneys. It was shown that MNTX is a substrate of the human organic cation transporter.

## · Pharmacokinetic drug interactions

Pharmacokinetic drug interactions  were  investigated  with  cimetidine,  ranitidine,  procainamide,  and morphine.  Although  MNTX  was  a  relevant  substrate  of  CYP2D6  and  the  human  organic  cation transporter, no clinical relevant interactions were assumed.

## Other Pharmacokinetic Studies

## · Placental Transfer and Lactal Excretion

Following  a  single  subcutaneous  administration  of  10  mg/kg  [ 3 H]-MNTX to  pregnant  rats,  tissue distribution  in  the  dam  and  fetus  was  investigated  up  to  8  hours  post-dose.  [ 3 H]-MNTX-derived radioactivity was  readily distributed to the fetus. The  fetal-to-maternal plasma radioactivity concentration ratio was 0.1 at the tmax (1 hour) in fetuses, which increased to 0.8 at the last sampling time  point  at  8  hours.  The  data  suggested  that  [ 3 H]-MNTX  and  possible  metabolites  crossed  the placenta and were cleared from fetal plasma at a lower rate than from maternal plasma.

Similarly, milk transfer of MNTX was shown in lactating rats. Lactating female rats were treated with a single subcutaneous injection of 10 mg/kg [ 3 H]-MNTX at day 10 postpartum. Milk was collected at different time-points up to 8 hours post-dose. Plasma and milk concentrations of [ 3 H]-MNTX were determined. The milk-to-maternal plasma concentration ratios at 0.5 and 8 hours after dosing were 0.1 and 24.0, respectively. These data indicated that [ 3 H]-MNTX-derived radioactivity was excreted into the  milk  of  lactating  rats;  as  a  result,  exposure  of  pups  to  the  drug  through  nursing  cannot  be excluded.

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

Single dose toxicity studies are summarised in the table below:

General  signs  of  toxicity  were  abnormal  gait  and  stance,  low  carriage,  body  tremors  and  labored respiration. The single dose toxicity studies exhibited a relatively low acute toxicity.

- Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Repeated dose toxicity studies are summarised in the table below:

Table 2: Repeat-dose toxicity studies.

Repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  mice,  rats,  and  dogs  by  oral  or  intravenous administration.  Although  MNTX  is  to  be  applied  subcutaneously,  the  applicant's  approach  was considered acceptable, since the pharmacokinetic studies showed similar exposures after subcutaneous (in human  80%  of  the  AUC  of  the  intravenous  application)  and  intravenous

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

administration  in  animals  as  well  as  in  human  volunteers.  As  shown  in  the  toxicokinetic  parts  of repeat-dose  toxicity  studies,  the  animals  were  sufficiently  exposed  to  MNTX.  Additionally,  no significant  metabolic  differences  were  found  between  the  different  administration  routes.  It  is noteworthy  that  the  solely  human  metabolite  M4  (methyl-6 α -naltrexole)  was  not  tested  in  animal experiments.

The  main  clinical  signs  of  MNTX  exposure  at  high  doses  were  tremors,  convulsion,  decreased activity, abnormal stance and gait, and prostration in rats as well as in dogs. In addition, in dogs also ptosis,  bloodshot  eyes,  protruding  nictitating  membranes,  dilated  pupils  and  absence  of  menstrual cycling were apparent.

Adverse CNS-related clinical signs occurred in rats after subcutaneous doses above 200 mg/kg/day and  after  intravenous  dosages  above  20  mg/kg/day.  In  dogs,  adverse  CNS-related  clinical  signs occurred after intravenous dosages of 20 mg/kg/day and at oral exposure above 180 mg/kg/day. These results supported the finding from the pharmacokinetic studies that limited amounts of MNTX may cross the blood-brain barrier of animals at high plasma concentrations.

Very high dose of MNTX ( ≥ 300 mg/kg/day in dogs and ≥ 500 mg/kg/day in rats) seemed to influence hemodynamic parameters (mainly blood pressure).

No changes of macroscopic, microscopic and clinical chemistry parameters were described.

The  toxicokinetic  data  provided  were  compromised  by  the  absence  of  a  calculation  of  the  safety margins for the individual studies. Only in the non-clinical overview some estimates could be found. The whole body of data showed that the animals were sufficiently exposed to MNTX in the toxicity studies.  With  the  exception  of  the  26  week  oral  rat  study  the  calculated  safety  margins  were considered sufficiently high to support the marketing authorisation. It remained a matter of debate if an  accumulation  of  MNTX  may  be  apparent  after  high  dosages  and  if  a  dose-dependent  linear increase  of  the  AUC  has  to  be  assumed.  Under  consideration  of  the  clinical  use  of  MNTX  (on demand) and the stipulated  dosage  (0.15  or 30 mg/kg) the clinical relevance was considered to be poor.

## · Genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo (with toxicokinetics)

Genotoxicity  was  addressed  extensively  in  a  battery  of  tests  (according  to  ICH  S2B)  containing bacterial reverse mutation assay, in vitro mammalian cell mutation assay, two in vitro mammalian cell chromosomal aberration assays and two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays with intraperitenoal and subcutaneous application. The studies did not provide any evidence for clinically relevant genotoxic potential of methylnaltrexone (MNTX).

## · Carcinogenicity (with toxicokinetics)

No carcinogenicity studies were provided. This was justified based on the limited life expectancy of the patient population and the absence of genotoxic potential.

## · Reproductive and developmental studies

MNTX was evaluated in a rat fertility study, in embryo/fetal development studies in rats and rabbits and in a pre/postnatal study in rats with subcutaneous or intravenous administration of the drug. All studies were GLP compliant. Milk and placental transfer of MNTX were shown after subcutaneous administration in the rat.

In the fertility study, MNTX impaired fertility in the high dose group rats. The NOAEL for fertility was therefore established at 25 mg/kg/day given subcutaneously. Studies on embryo-fetal development were conducted with intravenous application of MNTX to the rat and the rabbit. MNTX did not show any developmental toxicity (feto-/embryotoxicity, teratogenic effects). The developmental  NOAEL  was  considered  to  be  25  mg/kg/day  for  the  rat  and  16  mg/kg/day  for  the rabbit. Exposure of pregnant animals to MNTX was shown in single dose toxicokinetic studies. In the study on pre-/postnatal development in the rat, a reduction in pup weight was observed in the high dose group. Therefore, the NOAEL for pre/postnatal development was established at 25 mg/kg/day, the  next  lowest  dose.  Concurrently  with  the  pre/postnatal  study,  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were obtained. A safety margin of 38 could be calculated at the NOAEL for a human dose of 0.15 mg/kg and of 17 for a human dose of 0.30 mg/kg (based on AUC).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further evaluated

Juvenile toxicity studies were not performed.

- Local tolerance

Specific  local  tolerance  studies  were  not  performed.  However,  local  effects  in  the  various  toxicity studies  were  evaluated.  Even  though  the  local  tolerance  of  the  final  formulation  was  not  tested  in animals,  very  similar  solutions  were  used  in  the  non-clinical  studies.  In  these  studies  no  adverse injection site changes were observed. Additionally, the clinical safety data did not show an increased number of adverse events of skin and subcutaneous tissue.

## · Other toxicity studies

Impurities  were  found  to  be  limited  in  the  drug  substance  and  finished  product,  in  line  with  ICH guidelines.

The spectrum of MNTX exhibited no significant absorbance between 290 and 700 nm. However a minor peak was detected at 281.9 nm, which was considered to be without clinical relevance. The applicant  submitted  a  study  in  pigmented  rats,  whereby  no  distribution  into  the  skin  or  eyes  was detected, irrespective from the fact that MNTX distributed to the eye in one further study. Since no absorption in the relevant range was observed, further photo-safety testing was not required.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The  Applicant  provided  epidemiological  data  from  the  WHO  Statistical  Information  System (WHOSIS)  and  publications  for  the  estimation  of  number  of  patients  expected  to  be  treated  with methylnaltrexone bromide. The data resulted in a predicted environmental concentration in surfacewater  (PECsw)  for  MNTX  in  the  applied  indication  (i.e.  treatment  of  opioid-induced constipation in patients who have advanced illness) below the action limit of 10ng/l triggering a phase II environmental risk assessment. The final ERA submitted was therefore deemed acceptable.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The clinical programme for RELISTOR consists of six phase I, one phase II and two phase III studies, performed  to  establish  the  clinical  pharmacokinetics  and  the  clinical  safety  and  efficacy  of  s.c. methylnaltrexone in the palliative care setting.

The approved indication for RELISTOR is 'Treatment of opioid-induced constipation in advanced illness patients who are receiving palliative care when response to usual laxative therapy has not been sufficient.'

## GCP

The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

The  documentation  of  the  clinical  pharmacokinetics  of  methylnaltrexone  encompasses  six  phase  I studies (MNTX 102; MNTX 103; MNTX 1105-1108).

Studies  MNTX  103,  MNTX  1106,  and  3200K1-103-US  related  to  understanding  the  absorption, bioavailability,  and  pharmacokinetic  linearity  (dose-proportionality)  of  the  compound  given  as  s.c. injection.  Of  these,  MNTX  1106  was  a  pharmacodynamic  safety  study  designed  to  document  the effects  of  the  substance  on  QT  prolongation.  However,  because  of  the  different  dose  levels investigated, and the high number of subjects involved, it was used to document dose-proportionality.

Study MTNX 102 was a mass balance study with i.v. administration of the compound in order to determine the basic PK characteristics.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Studies MNTX 1105 and MNTX 1107 documented respectively the PK of MOA-728 in patients with renal  or  hepatic  impairment,  and  study  MNTX  1108  investigated  the  potential  interaction  with  a typical CYP 450 2D6 substrate (dextrometorphan).

The  applicant  submitted  2  further  studies  evaluating  certain  aspects  of  the  PK  of  the  substance (MNTX 1303 and MNTX 1304).

## Methods

Part of the methods used for the quantification of the active substance MTNX in human plasma and urine were published at an early stage of the development; others were developed in support of this submission.

Human plasma and urine concentrations of MNTX  and human urine concentrations of dextromethorphan  and  dextrorphan  were  determined  by  LC/MS/MS  assay  methods,  which  were properly validated and met the usual acceptance requirements.

## · Absorption

MNTX is absorbed rapidly following s.c. administration, with peak plasma concentrations achieved at approximately 0.5 hours. Cmax and AUC increase dose proportionally over the therapeutic dose range in healthy volunteers (Study MNTX 103). The terminal half life ranges from 6 to 9 hours and appears to be independent of dose and route of administration. (See table below).

Table 3: Pharmacokinetics estimated according to plasma concentration time course and cumulative urine data in study MNTX 103

| Metric           | IV MNTX      | SC MNTX      | SC MNTX      | SC MNTX      |
|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Metric           | 0.30 mg/kg   | 0.10 mg/kg   | 0.30 mg/kg   | 0.45 mg/kg   |

| AUC ∞ (ng/mL*h)  | 379.8 (52.9) | 73.3 (10.6)  | 303.2 (43.1) | 545.7 (34.6) |
| t max (h)        | 0.06 (0.01)  | 0.45 (0.21)  | 0.30 (0.11)  | 0.45 (0.11)  |
| t 1/2 (h)        | 7.81(1.17)   | 6.14 (0.88)  | 8.04 (1.67)  | 8.83 (0.85)  |
| F                |              | 0.60 (0.07)  | 0.82 (0.08)  | 0.99 (0.14)  |
| V area (L/Kg)    | 9.05 (1.81)  |              |              |              |
| V area /F (L/Kg) |              | 12.3 (2.1)   | 11.70 (2.90) | 10.5 (1.1)   |
| V ss (L/Kg)      | 1.96 (0.60)  |              |              |              |
| Cl (L/hr/kg)     | 0.80 (0.11)  |              |              |              |
| Cl/F (L/hr/kg)   |              | 1.39 (0.21)  | 1.00 (0.14)  | 0.83 (0.05)  |
| f R (%)          | 43.5 (7.1)   | 25.6 (4.0)   | 24.3 (4.2)   | 50.5 (4.1)   |
| Cl R (mL/min)    | 401.6 (88.6) | 397.5 (84.0) | 270.6 (44.8) | 469.5 (59.3) |

An absolute bioavailability of 82% was measured comparing the i.v. and s.c. routes of administration of the compound (at a dose of 0.30 mg/kg, comparing AUC).

Different formulations were used in the early development, in the phase III trials and for marketing.

A bioequivalence study for the comparison of the formulation G (stored at 25° C and intended to be the marketed formulation) and the formulation D (stored a 2-8°C) was performed (Study 3200K1-103US), which included 28 healthy male and female subjects, of whom 27 completed the study.

The mean plasma MOA-728 concentration versus time profiles of the current (formulation D) and the new (formulation G) s.c. formulations in the 27 healthy subjects at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg appeared to be identical. Moreover, the 90% CI's of the ratios of the Cmax and AUC values were clearly within the bioequivalence range of 0.80 to 1.25 for all the different formulations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since the compound is to be given as a subcutaneous injection, the influence of food intake was not investigated.

## · Distribution

The PK distribution was mainly characterised in study MNTX 102, which was performed with i.v. dosing  and  which  included  6  healthy  male  volunteers.  A  relatively  large  volume  of  distribution (Varea=7.92  ±1.54  l/kg)  was  found,  suggesting  that  MNTX  is  distributed  extensively  outside  the central  compartment.  The  distribution  after  repeated  i.v.  dosing  was  also  investigated  in  the interaction study MNTX 1108, where the distribution at steady state was determined with a mean Vss of 1.1 ± 0.21 l/kg, indicating a more moderate distribution into extravascular spaces.

A minimal distribution into blood cells was observed, as the total radioactivity in plasma was roughly twice than the one in the whole blood. MNTX resulted minimally bound to human plasma proteins as determined  by  equilibrium  analysis.  The  binding  of  MNTX  to  human  plasma  protein  ranged  from 11.0% to 15.3% (at the concentrations of 0.2 and 2.0 µ g/ml).

## · Elimination and metabolism

The  main  elimination  characteristics  were  determined  in  the  mass  balance  study  MNTX  102.  The mean  total  percent  of  administered  radioactivity  recovered  was  70.9%,  with  53.6%  in  urine,  and 17.3% in the faeces, predominantly within the first 24 hours in urine and within the first 48 hours in the faeces. The mean total percent of administered dose recovered in the urine was 58.6 ±18.2.

Exhaled  CO2  accounted  for  a  negligible  amount  of  radioactivity  (collected  in  periodic  samples  of expired air over an 8-hour period). Renal excretion and gastrointestinal efflux/hepato-biliary secretion of unchanged drug appeared to be the major mechanisms of MNTX clearance.

The total  clearance  of  MNTX amounted to 10.5 ± 1.5 ml/min/kg, although the contribution of the renal  clearance  was  only  6.37  ±  3.0  ml/min/kg.  Likewise,  renal  clearance  exceeded  creatinine clearance  by  up  to  4-fold  (Studies  MNTX  102  and  MNTX  103),  confirming  that  selective  tubular excretion  (active  renal  secretion)  occurred  significantly.  The  total  clearance  after  multiple  doses (interaction study 1108) was 11.11 ± 1.87 ml/min/kg.

Since MNTX is positively charged at any physiological pH, the process of its active renal secretion across  the  basolateral  membranes  of  proximal  tubule  cells  is  likely  to  be  mediated  mainly  by  the organic cation transporters hOCT. Study MNTX 1304 evaluated the interaction between MNTX and the  OCT  transporters,  whereby  cimetidine  (a  well-known  inhibitor  of  the  OCT-1  transporter)  was chosen as an appropriate comparator. Cimetidine was responsible for a limited increase of 10% of the plasma concentrations of MNTX, and this was deemed to be non-clinically relevant.

RELISTOR resulted metabolically stable both in human and rat liver microsomes, whereas substantial decreases  of  RELISTOR  were  seen  in  dog  microsomes,  indicating  time  and  dose  dependant significant metabolism. The complete metabolic profiling ( in vivo ) identified the following metabolites:  M1  (Methyl-6-naltrexol  Sulfate),  M2  (Methylnaltrexone  Sulfate),  M3  (Dihydroxymethyl-6-naltrexol), M4 (Methyl-6-naltrexol Isomer) and M5 (Methyl-6-naltrexol Isomer).

Overall, only limited biotransformation of MNTX was observed in humans after i.v. administration, as metabolism contributed for less than 10% of the total MNTX clearance.

The mean plasma AUC12 ratio of unchanged MNTX to total radioactivity was reported to be 0.59, potentially suggesting pharmacokinetic differences between parent drug and metabolites.

Methylnaltrexone is a chiral substance; the drug substance, however, consists of the R-isomer.

## · Pharmacokinetics of metabolites

Study MNTX-102 revealed that the metabolites PK profile appear to be different from the one of the mother compound. However, the PK of the metabolites was not investigated further. Given the low plasma levels of the metabolites, this was considered acceptable.

## · Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism

As  the  substance  was  only  metabolised  in  negligible  amounts,  consequences  of  any  genetic polymorphism  (relating  to  known  drug  metabolising  enzyme  genes)  were  not  expected.  Genetic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

polymorphism of the OCT-1 transporter gene and genetic polymorphism of the opioid receptor system were not established.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Linearity  was  investigated  in  study  MNTX  103  and  in  the  'definitive  QTc-study'  MTNX  1106, employing single doses of s.c. MNTX at the dose levels of 0.15 mg/kg, 0.30 mg/kg, and 0.5. mg/kg in 207  healthy  adult  subjects.  Blood  sampling  was  performed  simultaneously  with  ECG  tracing  at different time-points (up to 24 hours after dosing). A combined analysis of the relevant PK studies (MNTX 103, MNTX 1105, MNTX 1106, and MNTX 1107) was performed, collecting data from a total of 140 healthy volunteers.

Despite deviations observed for the 0.10 and the 0.45 mg/kg dose levels, overall a clear dose linearity could be concluded. MNTX administered at a dose of 0.45 mg/kg as a 20 minute i.v.-infusion every 6 hours  for  5  doses  resulted  in  a  minimal  accumulation  factor  (R)  of  1.19  (Study  MNTX  1108).  An accumulation factor of R=1.07 was determined in the QT study MNTX 1106.

It was recognised that the compound is to be given on an 'on demand' basis, and not more than one dose (of 8 mg or 12 mg) is proposed to be given within 24 hours.

Additional data were presented confirming that no or minimal accumulation should be anticipated for repeated administration of MNTX with a dosing interval of 6 hours or longer (Studies MNTX 1303 and MNTX 1108). Accumulation was also shown to be minimal in the steady-state PK profiles of s.c. MNTX  simulated  by  superposition  of  PK  data  following  s.c.  single  doses  of  0.30  mg/kg  (Study MNTX 1106).

## · Intra- and inter-individual variability

Intra-subject  coefficients  of  variation  for  Cmax  and  AUC at 13.4% and 9.2% were estimated (study MNTX-103), revealing  limited  variation  in  plasma  levels  within  and  between  subjects.  Additional data were presented on the pharmacokinetic metrics of MNTX following s.c. doses (MNTX 1106), indicating that variability for the relevant parameters (AUC24 and Cmax) was not of concern .

## · Pharmacokinetics in target population

No PK studies were performed in the target population.

## Special populations

## · Impaired renal function

The PK of MNTX in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment who did not require haemodialysis compared to healthy subjects was evaluated (Study MNTX 1105). The study enrolled 8 healthy  subjects,  matched  to  3  groups  of  8  patients  each  with  mild,  moderate,  or  severe  renal impairment. Each subject or patient received a single s.c. dose of 0.3 mg/kg MNTX.

MNTX was rapidly absorbed after s.c. administration with mean tmax values not relevantly different between the groups (0.4 to 0.6 hours). The t1/2 increased from 13.4 hours to 19.6 hours with increasing severity of renal disease. Cmax values displayed a relatively high variability but all in all suggesting a progressive  increase  with  degree  of  renal  impairment,  however,  with  only  the  group  with  severe impairment showing increased values as compared to the healthy volunteers. Mean total exposure did however increase as a function of renal impairment severity. Likewise, decreases in the % of MNTX dose  excreted  in  urine  and  in  renal  clearance  were  apparent  with  the  increase  in  severity  of  renal impairment.

In conclusion, renal function impairment had a marked effect on the PK of MNTX. However, an 8- to 9-fold  reduction  of  renal  clearance  resulted  in  only  a  2-fold  increase  in  total  exposure.  For comparison, the highest s.c. MNTX dose that was administered safely to healthy subjects (0.5 mg/kg) resulted in an exposure of 582 ± 111 ng/ml x h (study MNTX 1006). Severe impairment resulted in an AUC that was 20% greater (AUC0-24 739 ± 66 ng/ml x h) in study 1105. As a result, a dose adjustment is to be recommended for patients with severe renal impairment, and this is reflected in the SPC.

## · Impaired hepatic function

The effect of impaired hepatic function on the PK of MNTX was studied in study 1107.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Rapid absorption with tmax values of &lt;0.5 h occurred in all groups. t½ did not show a clear trend within the different groups (normal, mild and moderate hepatic function), suggesting that hepatic impairment did  not  have  an  effect  on  terminal  half  life.  However,  increased  and  relatively  high  variance  was observed, especially in the moderately impaired group.

There  was  a  trend  for  a  slight  increase  of  peak  exposures  with  the  degree  of  hepatic  impairment. Mean total exposure, however, did again show no clear trend, with a lower total exposure in the mild impairment group, and a slightly increased exposure for the moderately impaired patients.

The  fraction  for  renal  excretion  was  consistent  with  previous  findings  for  healthy  subjects,  but showed a decrease in the mildly and moderately impaired groups.

It  was  therefore  concluded  that  hepatic  status  does  not  have  a  clinically  significant  impact  on  the plasma  PK  of  MNTX,  and  no  dose  adjustment  appears  to  be  necessary  for  patients  with  mild  or moderate impairment. However, a cautionary note for patients with severe impairment, which were not investigated, appears to be necessary. This is reflected in the SPC.

## · Gender

The influence of gender on PK parameters was performed using a combined analysis of four studies (MNTX 1105-1107, and MNTX-103), including the data of a total of 140 healthy volunteers.

A significant difference in Cmax (and MRT values) and in the quantity recovered unchanged in the urine  (43%  for  females  and  49%  for  males)  was  detected,  however  these  differences  were  not considered  clinically  significant.  Overall,  the  analysis  of  the  PK  parameters  showed  no  relevant differences between the two genders.

## · Race

Statistically  significant  differences  were  detected  for  t ½  and  V/F.  However,  clinical  significance of these findings was denied. In conclusion, a clinical effect of race and ethnicity on the PK parameters (e.g. percent of dose eliminated in the urine) was not observed.

## · Weight

Body weight was found to have a statistically significant effect on the following four metrics: AUC ∞ , Cl/F, and tmax.  The effect was, however, not considered clinically relevant. The relation of AUC with body weight, showing relatively higher exposure at the upper end of the weight scale, was used to determine the fixed dosing schedule proposed for clinical use.

## · Justification of fixed dosing regimen:

The vast majority (approx. 95%) of patients included in the clinical efficacy and safety programme were  in  the  weight  band  of  38  -  114  kg  for  which  the  fixed  dosing  regimen  (8  mg  or  12  mg)  is proposed.

Mean AUC estimates (0.15 mg/kg and 0.30 mg/kg) over a body weight range of 38 to 114 kg using the AUC body weight relation are shown below ( Table 4 ):

|   Body Weight (kg) |   0.15 mg/kg |   0.30 mg/kg |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------|
|                 38 |          139 |          277 |
|                 68 |          179 |          357 |
|                114 |          240 |          480 |

The exposure at the higher end of these ranges is relatively high, and therefore a smaller weight-based dose could be given to these patients while maintaining a similar level of exposure.

The proposed fixed dosing regimen results in the following relative weight-based doses and predicted exposure ( Table 5 ):

| Body Weight (kg)   |   Dose (mg) | Dose (mg/kg)   | AUC (ng·h/mL)   |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 38-61              |           8 | 0.21-0.13      | 194-148         |
| 62-114             |          12 | 0.19-0.11      | 220-169         |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It was concluded from these data that the AUC obtained at doses of 8 and 12 mg for their respective weight  bands  are  comparable  to  those  obtained  with  the  0.15  mg/kg  for  the  given  population  with body weights of 38 to 114 kg. In fact the predicted exposure seems to be relatively lower in the group with higher weights, and in the same range for the low(er) weight group.

## · Elderly

The applicant performed a phase I PK study comparing the PK profile of MNTX in the elderly and non-elderly population (Study MNTX 1303). The study enrolled 14 (10 treated, 4 placebo) healthy young (18-45 year) subjects and 14 (10 treated, 4 placebo) healthy elderly (65 ≥ year) subjects. All subjects received MNTX 24 mg as a slow infusion over 20 minutes at day 1, followed by 17 doses between day 3 and day 7 every 6 hours.

The study revealed a somewhat slower clearance in the elderly (mean Cl = 70 L/h in the young, 56 L/h in the elderly). A little difference regarding Cmax of MNTX was also observed, whereas a larger and significant increase of 32.1% and 20.3% at day 1 and day 7 respectively was shown for AUCt. However,  this  change  of  clearance  and  AUCt  in  the  elderly  was  considered  to  be  not  clinically relevant. In conclusion, age appeared to have a slight effect on the PK of MNTX, and this effect was considered  to  be  in  line  with  the  reduction  of  renal  clearance  with  age.  The  effect  was,  however, considered  not  clinically  relevant  and  not  sufficient  in  extent  to  require  a  modification  in  dose  or dosing regimen.

## · Children

MTNX was not investigated in children.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

## · In vitro

In vitro investigations revealed that MNTX did not induce CYP P450 enzymes and did not inhibit the CYP enzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4 in human microsomes. However, a modest competitive inhibition of CYP 2D6 activity (IC50 value = 15.92 µ M and Ki = 7.93 µ M) was observed.

Further reassurance on CYP 2E1 enzymes was provided, as the applicant demonstrated that clinically significant MNTX drug-drug interactions based on induction of CYP 2E1 activity are unlikely (study RPT-72520), and that MNTX does not show in vitro inhibition of CYP 2E1 or CYP 2B6 activity at the highest concentration tested (100 µM) (study RPT-71772).

## · In vivo

A clinical interaction study (Study MNTX-1108), enrolling overall 54 subjects (45 receiving at least one  dose  of  a  study  medication),  was  performed.  31  subjects  were  randomised  to  one  of  the  four treatment groups and all of these completed the study. The endpoint for this study was the change in urine  dextromethorphan/free  dextrorphan  ratio  for  patients  treated  with  either  MNTX  (two  dose levels), paroxetine, or placebo.

A  considerable  change  occurred  in  the  ratio  from  baseline  in  the  paroxetine  group,  whereas  the changes in the other groups appeared to be negligible and in the range of placebo. This suggested an inhibitory effect of paroxetine 20 mg PO on CYP 2D6 activity. Overall, CYP 2D6 activity appeared not to be influenced to a clinically relevant extent, as even supra-therapeutic levels of MNTX did not influence the metabolic ratio of a typical 2D6 substrate. In conclusion, a clinically relevant interaction regarding the inhibition of CYP 2D6 with MNTX appeared to be highly unlikely.

## Exposure relevant for safety evaluation

S.c.  methylnaltrexone  was  investigated  in  4  phase  I  studies  (MNTX  103,  MNTX  1105-1107), evaluating 269 subjects in total. The whole phase I programme also comprised data from 8 healthy adult  volunteers  included  in  the  i.v.  mass  balance  study  MNTX-102,  from  13  healthy  volunteers receiving a single i.v. dose of 0.30 mg/dl in the Study MNTX-206, and from 16 healthy volunteers of which  8  each  received  i.v.  (multiple  dose)  and  s.c  MNTX  (single-dose)  in  the  interaction  study MNTX 1108. The studies which were filed at later time-points (MNTX 1303 and 1304) included 20 and 18 healthy volunteers). As a result, the total exposure to MNTX in phase I was 344.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacodynamics

The  pharmacodynamics  (PD)  in  man  was  mainly  investigated  by  the  University  of  Chicago programme, for which several literature reports relating to human pharmacodynamics were reported. The further development on PD only included the QT-safety study and a study on the influence of MOA-728 on the reversal of opioid effects on the human urinary bladder.

## · Mechanism of action

MNTX is a quaternary benzomorphan derivative that is a selective antagonist of opioid binding at µ -receptors. In vitro studies showed that MNTX binds to human µ -opioid receptors with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 28 nm (equivalent to approximately 9.7 ng/ml). The substance is highly selective for the µ -receptor, as it has a 8-fold less potency to κ -receptors and does not interact with δ -receptors. A variety of other receptors were investigated which MNTX does not interact with.

In  a  variety  of  further  pre-clinical  investigations  MNTX  prevented  morphine-induced  inhibition  of electrically  induced  stimulation  of  the  gut  in  the  guinea  pig  and  isolated  human  small  intestine. Selectivity  for µ -receptors  was  also  shown  in  a  gastric-brainstem  preparation.  The  blocking  of  the slowing  of  GI  transit  time  was  shown  in  rats.  In  addition,  attenuation  of  prostaglandin-induced diarrhoea  was  observed  in  mice  and  attenuation  of  morphine-induced  inhibition  of  gut  electrical activity  in  dogs.  The  compound  was  also  shown  to  reverse  opioid-induced  emesis  in  dogs  and  to decrease morphine-induced kaolin intake in rats (as a model for emesis).

Further  studies  proved  that  administration  of  MNTX  does  not  interfere  with  opioid  analgesia  at dosages that relieve opioid-induced GI side effects (mouse hot plate model, rat hot plate test, rat tail flick  assay,  and  guinea  pig  toe  pinch  test).  Interference  with  analgesia  and  opioid  withdrawal symptoms were only seen at high doses of 30 mg/kg in mice.

## · Primary pharmacology

The  primary  pharmacology  of  the  compound  was  documented  in  one  phase  I  urodynamic  study performed by the applicant (Study MNTX 206), and a variety of studies performed at early stages of the development, which were only included as literature reports.

Study  MNTX  206  tested  the  effect  of  naloxone  and  i.v.  methylnaltrexone  in  reversing  the  opioid effects  on  bladder  function  in  healthy  volunteers.  Naloxone  successfully  reversed  opioid  bladder effects, whereas administration of placebo had no effect on urinary retention. In contrast to placebo, MNTX reversed urinary  retention  in  27%  of  the  subjects  and  had  a  clear  albeit  lower  effect  than naloxone on maximal detrusor pressure.

The evaluation of pupil diameter measurements revealed that MNTX exerted CNS effects similar to placebo,  while  the  pure  opioid-antagonist  naloxone  successfully  reversed  opioid-induced  miosis. Thus,  the  absence  of  central  effects  of  MNTX  was  concluded,  while  a  partial  antagonism  to  the (presumed peripheral) opioid effects on the urinary bladder could be seen.

Overall, MNTX did not exert CNS effects at notable levels while resulted able to (at least partially) reverse peripheral opioid effects. However, as the specific mechanism and receptor for the induction of the effects on the urinary bladder are not known, a clear conclusion regarding receptor specificity could not be drawn.

Literature studies revealed that MNTX at all dose levels and in all ways of administration (i.v., s.c. and  oral) reverses the morphine-induced  prolongation  of  oro-caecal  transit  time,  which  was considered a consistent proof of the µ -receptor antagonising effect, as the pharmacology of morphine in the GI tract is well established.

Consistent  results  across  the  studies  were  also  observed  for  the  missing  influence  of  MNTX  on centrally  mediated  effects  of  opioids,  including  pain,  and  hypoxemia.  Inconsistent  results  were observed  for  the  reversal  of  opioid-induced  subjective  effects,  such  as  nausea,  vomiting,  flushing, itching and others.

Early clinical studies concluded that MNTX is able to induce bowel movements in long-term users of opioids, but has, however, no consistent effect on post-operative nausea and vomiting.

## · Secondary pharmacology

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cardiovascular safety - as part of the secondary pharmacology - was investigated because of adverse findings  in  animals  regarding  the  prolongation  of  the  QT  interval.  Furthermore,  an  early  tolerance study  (available  as  literature  report  only)  resulted  in  a  high  rate  of  37.5%  cases  of  orthostatic hypotension in healthy volunteers when given and 0.64 mg/kg i.v. push-dose.

Despite a negative outcome of the in  vitro studies  on  the  isolated hERG-channel, a 'thorough QTstudy' according to the respective guideline (E 14; then available as concept paper recommendations) was performed due to findings in animals.

Study MNTX-1106 was conducted as a double-blind, placebo and positive controlled parallel group study,  including  a  moxifloxacin  arm  as  positive  control.  MNTX  was  investigated  at  0.15  mg/kg (approx. the dose for routine clinical use), 0.30 mg/kg, and 0.50 mg/kg single s.c. doses. Moxifloxacin was given as a single 400 mg tablet (not blinded).

12-lead ECGs were performed at different time-points up to 24 hours on day 1 (baseline) and on day 1 (after dosing).

The primary ECG variables were QT/QTc interval duration (QTcI=individual corrected QT duration) measured from the 12-lead electronic ECG recordings. Secondary endpoints included the Bazett- and Fridericia-corrected  QTc  intervals.  Additionally,  a  central  tendency  and  outlier  analysis  (with standard categorical definitions) was performed.

A  total  of  546  healthy  volunteers  were  screened  for  the  study,  of  which  339  failed  the  screening criteria; thus, 207 subjects were enrolled (safety population), of which 206 successfully concluded the study. 7 subjects were excluded from the analysis due to inadequate ECG recordings. The five groups were  comparable  regarding  the  demographic  characteristics.  The  subjects  were  18-45  years  old (inclusive), with a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18-30 (inclusive), and weight between 50-110 kg.

The positive control produced a mean QTc prolongation that was significantly different from placebo and therefore consistent with published data, thus validating the sensitivity of the study.

Results  showed  that  single  s.c.  doses  of  MNTX  up  to  the  supratherapeutic  dose  of  0.50  mg/kg (approx. 3x the dose proposed for routine clinical use) did not produce any signal of an effect on QTc prolongation or any suggestion of an effect on secondary ECG parameters or waveform morphology. It was therefore concluded that the potential for QT prolongation from single s.c. doses of MNTX is expected to be - if any - very low.

## Relationship between plasma concentration and effect

No  analysis  of  the  relationship  of  the  plasma  concentration  and  effect  was  performed  out  of  the pharmacodynamic  studies.  An  analysis  with  extrapolation  of  the  estimated  plasma  levels  in  the clinical programme with the laxation responses observed was presented. No clear conclusions could be  drawn  by  this  rather  unusual  analysis,  which  was  not  based  on  pure  pharmacodynamic investigations/endpoints, but on clinical response criteria and simulation of exposures. However, in view of the overall clinical results, no concern was derived from the missing of a proper PD/doseresponse relationship analysis.

## Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances

The mechanism of action is competitive inhibition at µ -receptors, and no further receptors were found to interact with the compound. For this reason, no additional studies on possible pharmacodynamic interactions were performed.

## Genetic differences in PD response

Genetic differences in µ -receptors or the whole opioid receptor system could not be regarded as being well-established. Therefore, no such investigations were performed.

## Clinical efficacy

The clinical  program  for  the  evaluation  of  efficacy  of  methylnaltrexone  in  the  treatment  of  opioid induced constipation in palliative care patients with a life expectancy of 1 to 6 month included the studies described in the table below:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Dose response study (Study MNTX 251)

This was a phase 2 dose ranging study with duration of up to 4 weeks. It was designed as a multicentre, randomized, parallel group study with a double-blind period (week 1) and an open label period (weeks 2 through 4). Thirty-three patients were randomly assigned to receive fixed dose of MNTX (1, 5, 12.5, or 20mg QOD) under double blind conditions during the first week. Eighteen patients entered the  open  label  period  and  were  treated  with  doses  between  5  and  20mg  MNTX  QOD  for  up  to  3 weeks.

The  study  was  conducted  in  patients  with  advanced  medical  illness  and  poorly  controlled  opioid induced constipation who were receiving palliative care. Additional inclusion criteria were the receipt of opioid medication for at least two weeks and a stable laxative regimen of any type for more than 4 days.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the laxation response on day one within four hours after study drug  administration.  Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  patient  recorded  evaluation  of  bowel movement, constipation, pain, opioid withdrawal effects and patient satisfaction.

The following table summarizes the proportions of patients who reported laxation within four hours, and then within 24 hours of dosing on day 1, 3, and 5 during the double blind phase.

Being  the  mean  weight  of  the  included  patient  population  65  kg,  the  doses  applied  in  this  study approximately correspond to 0.015mg/kg, 0.08mg/kg, 0.19mg/kg and 0.31mg/kg in the four groups.

The nominal p-values for individual comparisons for 4-hour laxation response on day 1 between the 1mg dose and the 5mg, 12.5mg, and 20mg doses were 0.05, 0.06, and 0.52, respectively. The lowest response rate was found in the 1mg group (10%). Clear and clinically relevant efficacy differences between the dose groups 5mg, 12.5mg and 20mg could not be observed. The choice of the 0.15mg and 0.30mg/kg doses had to be considered somewhat arbitrary, and was considered acceptable only because  no  dose-related safety signals were  detected  in the dose  range  investigated in the confirmatory trial.

## · Main studies

## MNTX 301 / 301 EXT

MNTX 301 was a multi-centre, phase 3 study that included a 1-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled period followed by a 4-week open label period. The study was conducted in patients with advanced medical  illness  and  opioid  induced  constipation.  The  301  EXT  study  was  a  3-month  open-label extension of the 301 study. Patients were randomized to receive a single dose of MNTX 0.15mg/kg (N=47), MNTX 0.30mg/kg (N=55), or Placebo (N=52). 136 patients participated in the 4-week open label  period  all  treated  with  MNTX  (0.05,  0.15,  or  0.30mg/kg).  21  patients  participated  in  the  3month, open label extension study.

## METHODS

## Study Participants

Patients had to fulfil, among others, all of the following criteria to be eligible for entry into the 301 study:

- -Advanced medical illness with a life expectancy of 1 to 6 month.
- -No clinically significant laxation within 48 hours prior to the first dose of study drug
- -On stable opioid regimen for the control of pain for three or more days before randomization. Stable was defined as no reduction in dose of 50% or more of the opioid dose within 3 days prior  study drug administration.
- -On a stable laxative regimen 3 or more days prior to treatment. The three day restriction on laxatives  was  applied  to  standing  ordered  laxatives.  If  a  rescue  laxative  was  given  and  was successful, an additional 48 hours without laxation had to elapse for the patient to be eligible to start the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients with any disease process suggestive of gastrointestinal obstruction or with any potential nonopioid cause of bowl dysfunction were not eligible.

## Treatments

In  the  double-blind  period  of  the  study  patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  receive  one  dose  of methylnaltrexone  (0.15mg/kg  or  0.30mg/kg)  or  placebo  in  a  1:1:1  ratio.  Study  medication  was administered subcutaneous in matching volumes. Patients who completed the single dose double blind period of the study (one single administration of the study drug) were eligible to enter the 4-week open  label  period  and  were  to  start  treatment  with  a  subcutaneous  dose  of  methylnaltrexone 0.15mg/kg.  Subsequent  doses  were  adjusted  (0.075mg/kg,  0.15mg/kg,  or  0.30mg/kg)  based  upon efficacy or side effects. In the 301 EXT study, dosing was to begin with the dose level last received in protocol MNTX 301, and subsequent doses were adjusted to one of the three above mentioned dose levels at the discretion of the investigator.

The double blind medication was administered by a qualified study staff member. Subsequent doses were administered by a trained caregiver. Patients were to remain seated following dose administration.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint of the 301 study was laxation response within 4 hours of treatment. The patient (or caregiver) was asked to complete an assessment of each bowel movement using the ratings date and time of bowel movements, consistency of stool, and difficulties during defecation.

Secondary endpoints were the assessment of constipation distress, the assessment of pain, assessment of symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal, and the rating of the overall change in bowel status on a 7-point scale. Secondary endpoints were evaluated during both the double-blind and open-label periods. Additional secondary endpoints included:

- Laxation response within 24 hours of treatment;
- changes in a 5-point constipation distress scale
- changes in bowel movement consistency
- changes in bowel movement difficulty
- changes in pain scores
- changes in opioid withdrawal symptoms
- global clinical impression of change ratings
- use of rescue laxative medication
- changes in bowel movement frequency

No evaluation of quality of life parameters was included within the endpoints.

The  301  EXT  study  included  also  most  of  the  above-mentioned  efficacy  endpoints,  but  clinical evaluations were only recorded monthly. This study provided mainly long-term safety data regarding methylnaltrexone administration.

## Sample size

The study was planned to accrue approximately 150 patients (50 per treatment arm). Comparison of each  of  the  two  doses  of  MNTX  was  made  at  the  0.025  Type  I  level  of  significance  to  adjust  for multiplicity.  4-hour  laxation  responses  recorded  during  a  phase  2  study  of  methylnaltrexone  in patients  with  advanced  medical  illness  were  on  the  order  of  55%  to  67%  following  doses  of approximately 0.10-0.15mg/kg. Thus for this study a sample size of 50 patients per treatment group was determined to be able to detect a difference in the portion of responders on the order of at least 0.35.

## Randomisation

Patients  were  randomly assigned in blocks of three within each study centre to the three treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio according to a computer-generated randomization scheme.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Blinding (masking)

A  qualified  designee  at  the  study  site  assigned,  recorded,  and  dispensed  boxes  of  double-blind medication to the patients. Study drug methylnaltrexone or placebo) was provided by the Sponsor in identical-appearing vials.

## Statistical methods

No per protocol analysis (for the primary endpoint of the double-blind study phase) were conducted because only 1 patient would have been ineligible. The efficacy analysis was to be performed on the intent-to-treat  analysis  set,  which  was  defined  as  all  randomized  patients  who  received  the  double blind dose of the study drug. Baseline values were to be the value recorded before administration of the double-blind dose of medication for the double-blind period of the study and the predose values measured before the first open-label dose.

The analysis of the primary endpoint was to be performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test that  included a comparison of methylnaltrexone against placebo and a term for treatment-by centre interaction. If the interaction was statistically not significant, then a Chi-square test was to be used to compare each methylnaltrexone dose against placebo at the type 1 error level of 0.0249.

Among the secondary endpoints, the proportion of patients with a laxation response within 24 hours of treatment as well as the respective confidence intervals were calculated by randomized treatment group.  The  distributions  of  changes  from  baseline  in  the  constipation  distress  scale  and  bowel movement assessments were summarized and compared between treatment groups. The proportion of patients with improvement in constipation distress and global clinical impressions of changes scores were summarized and compared between treatment groups.

Primary  and  secondary  endpoints  were  explored  to  determine  if  any  subgroup  interactions  were present. Factors to be included were age, gender, race, baseline constipation distress score, study site, primary  disease,  baseline  opioids,  and  baseline  WHO  performance  scale.  Outcome  variables  were tabulated  by  treatment  group  and  factor  level.  If  any  factor  was  significantly  different  between baseline  treatment  groups  at  or  below  the α =0.10  level,  it  may  have  been  included  in  additional models to test the treatment-by-factor interaction in a multivariate model.

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 154 patients were treated with a single double-blind dose, of which 147 patients entered the open-label  period,  136  being  treated  with  methylnaltrexone.  72  patients  completed  the  open-label period and 75 patients discontinued prematurely. 27 patients entered the EXT study, 21 receiving at least one dose of methylnaltrexone.

Reasons for premature discontinuation are outlined in the following table.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary endpoint

Significantly more patients treated with either dose of MNTX had rescue free laxation within 4 hours of  receiving  the  double  blind dose of study drug compared with placebo-treated patients (see table below).

[1] P-values are the nominal p-value in the pairwise comparison of each MNTX dose with placebo. Because of the interim analysis and comparison of each dose with placebo, p-values &lt;0.0249 are considered statistically significant.

Laxation response 4-hours after dosing was 62% for the methylnaltrexone 0.15mg/kg group, 58% for the  methylnaltrexone  0.30mg/kg  group,  and  13.5%  for  the  placebo  group.  Thus,  the  superiority  of MNTX over placebo in the induction of prompt laxation was clearly demonstrated.

## Secondary endpoints

Significantly more patients treated with methylnaltrexone had rescue free laxation within 24 hours of receiving  the  double-blind  dose  of  study  drug  compared  with  placebo-treated  patients  (see  table below).

[1] P-values are the nominal p-value in the pairwise comparison of each MNTX dose with placebo. Because of the interim analysis and comparison of each dose with placebo, p-values &lt;0.0249 are considered statistically significant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Laxation  response  at  24  hours  was  68%  for  the  methylnaltrexone  0.15mg/kg  group,  64%  for  the methylnaltrexone  0.30mg/kg  group,  and  27%  for  the  placebo  group,  confirming  the  superiority  of MNTX over placebo in the induction of laxation.

Results from the open label extension phase showed that comparable rates for laxation were found in all  three  (former)  treatment  groups,  resembling  the  rates  of  the  two  groups  with  active  treatment during the double-blind phase.

The time to laxation was significantly shorter for the active treatment groups compared to placebo in the double-blind treatment phase (1.10 hours and 0.8 hours versus &gt;24 hours in the 0.15mg/kg, the 0.30mg/kg and the placebo groups respectively).

The comparison of bowel movement consistency and difficulty was hampered by the fact that only a few  patients  in  the  placebo  group  had  bowel  movements  at  all.  As  a  result,  the  nominal  figures showing similar results for improvement in all three treatment groups does not necessarily mean that stool  consistency  and  difficulties  with  defecation  remained  at  the  same  level  in  all  three  treatment groups.  However,  the  study  design  (with  the  very  short  observation  period)  was  considered inappropriate for the evaluation of this endpoint. Similar conclusions were drawn for the open-label phase of the study, because the number of patients remaining in the study decreased rapidly over time.

The  evaluation  of  the  subjective  rating  of  constipation  distress,  however,  resulted  in  a  clear superiority  of  the  two  active  treatment  groups,  with  63-64%  of  patients  rating  an  improvement,  as compared to 34% in the placebo group after 4 hours. Similar results were reported for the 24 hours evaluation.

The global clinical impression of change also revealed that a majority of patients (59%) felt better with active treatment, in comparison to only 22% in the placebo group.

## Study MNTX 302

Study MNTX 302 was a multi-centre phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel group study in which patients were treated with 0.15 mg/kg MNTX s.c. (N=63) or placebo (N=71) every other day for 2 weeks. Dose escalation to 0.30 mg/kg was possible during the second week. The study  was  extended  with  a  3-month  open-label  extension  phase  (N=82)  with  dose  adjustments  to 0.075 or 0.30 mg/kg if necessary and administration was on an 'as needed' basis with a maximum dosing frequency of 1 dose per 24 hours.

## METHODS

## Study Participants

Among other inclusion criteria, patients had to have been taking opioid medication for the control of pain/discomfort for at least 2 weeks before the first does of study drug with the regimen being stable for  at  least  3  days  ('stable'  being  defined  as  'no  reduction  of ≥ 50%,  increases  being  allowed). Opioid induced constipation was defined by either having less than 3 bowel movements during the previous  week  by  history  and  without  having  a  clinically  significant  laxation  within  the  24  hours before  the  first  dose  of  the  study  drug,  or  without  a  clinically  significant  laxation  within  48  hours prior  to  the  first  dose  of  the  study  drug  (the  latter  definition  was  only  introduced  by  protocol amendment 3 on 8 th June, 2005, after already 111 patients had been included into the study).

Furthermore, patients had to be on a stable laxative regimen for at least 3 days before the first dose of the  study  drug  (not  counting  rescue  medication).  In  case  of  the  use  of  a  rescue  laxative  (including suppositories  or  enemas)  an  additional  24  hours  (in  case  of  less  than  3  bowel  movement  during previous week) or 48 hours (in case of the 48 hours criterion) without laxation had to elapse for the patient to be eligible. Rescue laxative within 4 hours before the study drug dose were to be avoided.

Moreover, patients had to have advanced medical illness, however, with a predicted life expectancy of &gt;1 month.

Exclusion  criteria  were,  amongst  others,  the  suspected  potential  of  a  non-opioid  cause  of  bowel dysfunction, gastrointestinal obstruction, and faecal impaction.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

Patients  either  received  0.15  mg/kg  MNTX  or  placebo  by  s.c.  injection.  The  first  dose  was administered by a staff member, and subsequent doses by a trained caregiver into the shoulder area, buttocks, abdomen, thighs, or extremities with rotation of injection sites.

The study drug was provided as vials each containing MNTX at a concentration of 40 mg/ml in 1.1 ml vehicle for single use (or identical placebo vials).

The starting dose was the same for all patients, given QOD for the first week. If a patient had less than 3 bowel movements by day 8 (not associated with rescue medication or intervention), the patient was then eligible to receive the double volume of the study drug (i.e. 0.30 mg/kg in case of MNTX) QOD.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Two co-primary endpoints were used in this study: the proportion of patients with laxation within 4 hours after the first dose of study drug and the proportion of patients with ≥ 2 laxations within 4 hours after dose administration over 4 doses (the first week of double-blind treatment).

Secondary endpoints were the following: the laxation responses within 4 hours of each dose of study medication, and the proportion of subjects with ≥ 4 laxations within 4 hours post dosing over 7 doses (the whole treatment period of 2 weeks).

Tertiary  endpoints  included  the  following:  the  proportion  of  patients  with ≥ 3  laxations  per  week during double-blind dosing, the time to laxation onset post-dosing, the laxation responses within 24 hours following each dose, the number of laxations per week for each study week (week 1 and 2), the number  of  rescue-free  laxations  per  week  during  double-blind  dosing,  the  changes  in  bowel movement consistency,  the  changes  in  bowel  movement  difficulty,  the  changes  in  pain  scores,  the changes in opioid withdrawal symptoms (using a modified Himmelsbach scale), the global impression of change ratings by patients and assessors (GCIC), and the use of rescue laxative medication.

## Sample size

The sample size was estimated to be 130 patients (approx. 65 per patient group) with the following assumptions: a difference between the treatment and placebo group of 0.30 - 0.35 in either of the two primary endpoints and an assumed placebo response rate of 20% as well as an adjusted alpha level of 0.025 (two sided) and a power of 90%. The estimated differences were based on the response rates of study MNTX 251.

## Randomisation

Patients  were  randomly  allocated  to  receive  one  of  the  two  study  drugs  in  a  1:1  ratio  with  block randomisation.

## Blinding (masking)

Same as for Study MNTX 301.

## Statistical methods

The co-primary analyses were to be performed on the ITT analysis set by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test  of  placebo  against  MNTX with study centre as stratification factor. If there was no significant treatment-by-centre interaction observed (with a p-value of ≤ 0.10) the primary endpoint was to be analysed with a Chi-square test. Response rates will be calculated and presented with 95% confidence intervals.

For the one- and two weeks evaluations the LOCF method was to be used.

The  analysis  of  the  secondary  endpoints  was  to  compare  placebo  to  all  possible  MNTX  doses combined, as well as to the doses received.

The  nominal  type  I  error  of  significance  for  secondary  and  tertiary  endpoints  was  0.05.  For  the primary  endpoints  this  level  was  adjusted  to  0.249  to  account  for  multiple  comparisons  and  the interim analysis performed (see below).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

An interim analysis was planned after approx. 50% of the patients had completed the double-blind period  in  order  to  assess  safety  of  MNTX  and  to  re-estimate  the  sample  size,  thus  ensuring  that enough subjects were enrolled to preserve adequate power. An alpha level adjustment of 0.000076 was made to preserve the alpha level of 0.0249 for the final analysis. Safety data were analysed by the DSMB (consisting  of  2  clinicians  and  1  biostatistician).  The  efficacy  results  were  analysed  by  a biostatistician who was external to both the DSMB and the sponsor and the results were presented to the  DSMB, which recommended that the sponsor continue the study as planned with no change in sample size. According to the study report, the sponsor did not receive copy of the interim analysis.

## RESULTS

Participant flow

## Recruitment

The  study  was  conducted  in  26  centres,  located  in  Canada  and  the  US.  The  study  began  on  28 th February 2004 and ended on 16 th October 2005. As is known from the protocol amendment No. 3, (8 th June 2005), during the first 15 months of the study, 111 patients were recruited and randomized, and accordingly 24 patients after the protocol amendment. (approx. 4 months). Recruitment was therefore rather slow, with 7.4 patients/month before the protocol amendment, and 6.0 patients/month after the amendment.

## Baseline data

In the vast majority of characteristics clinically relevant differences were not seen. The majority of patients  were  Caucasian  and  cancer  patients.  A  higher  percent  of  patients  in  the  MNTX  group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(14.3%) had COPD and/or emphysema than in the placebo group (7.0%). All other disease-related characteristics appear to be relatively well balanced with the exception of the opioid dose/day, which was considerably higher in the MNTX group (417.0 mg) than in the placebo group (339 mg).

## Numbers analysed

The efficacy analyses were performed in the ITT analysis set, which included all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug (71 placebo, and 62 MNTX).

The one patient excluded from the ITT set was an 88-year old female who was incorrectly entered into  the  study  without  being randomised, and was given unblinded MNTX from a supply of openlabel medication intended for the extension phase of the study. The patient is therefore only included in the safety analysis.

No per-protocol evaluation was performed, as no exclusion for major protocol violations had to be performed.

| Overall Response | 71                | 33 (46.5)                           | 34.9-58.1                    | 62             | 49 (79.0)                           | 68.9-89.2                    |

Similar  results  were  seen  in  the  evaluation  of  all  doses  for  the  24  hours  time-point,  although  with somewhat higher rates in both the placebo and MNTX groups, but with similar differences.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The secondary endpoints were generally in support of the primary endpoints. The laxation response over  all  7  doses  was  5.6%  in  the  placebo  group  and  38.7%  in  the  MNTX  group.  The  number  of patients with a dose adjustment in the second week was equal between the treatment groups (about 30%  each).  The  time-related  evaluations  (time  to  laxation  within  4  and  48  hours  of  dose  1)  also showed a significant superiority of MNTX over placebo.

Evaluation of the laxation responses per week and of the 'constipation criterion' regarding frequency (patients with at least 2 laxations per week) revealed that a significantly higher proportion of MNTXtreated patients achieved a 'satisfactory' weekly bowel movement frequency. However, the overall frequency  of  bowel  movements  during  the  second  week  was  not  different  between  the  treatment groups, possibly indicating a similar efficacy of MNTX treatment with standard and rescue laxative treatment combined.

Patients that had a dose escalation during the second week of treatment had a moderate increase in response rates in the MNTX group (from 15% to 24%) but not in the placebo group (from 8% to 7%).

Evaluation  of  stool  consistency  could  only  be  assessed  in  patients  who  actually  had  bowel movements. Patients with watery bowel movements were equally distributed between the treatment groups (16.7% in the placebo group and 15.9% in the MNTX group).

Evaluation of the rating of bowel movement difficulties revealed a clear and stronger improvement in the MNTX groups in comparison to placebo. Likewise, evaluation of constipation distress revealed overall  better  results  for  MNTX  as  compared  to  placebo,  however,  with  diminishing  superiority towards the end of the observation period.

Also, the global impression of change as assessed by the patients and the treating physicians revealed a clear superiority of MNTX over placebo for the first, as well as for the second week of treatment.

An  additional,  explorative  evaluation  of  response  rates  incorporating  the  criteria  bowel  movement frequency (at least 3 per week), stool consistency and defecation symptoms according to severity at baseline  was  performed.  This  evaluation  revealed  that  a  significant  treatment  effect  could  be preserved  even  if  these  criteria  for  'functional  obstipation'  patients  were  applied.  However,  the therapeutic effect was greatest in those most severely affected but was diminished in those with only mild  or  no  such  symptoms.  In  particular,  when  looking  at  the  more  objective  criterion  of  'stool consistency  rating',  there  was  no  relevant  difference  between  MNTX  and  placebo  (38.5%  versus 35.5% respectively).

## Ancillary analyses

## -Opioid withdrawal

The changes in pain scores over time (up to 14 days) were evaluated in the two pivotal studies to prove  that  MNTX  does  not  exert  central  effects.  No  differences  were  seen  between  the  treatment groups,  indicating  no  consistent  effect  of  MNTX  on  analgesia.  Likewise,  the  evaluation  of  the withdrawal  symptoms  according  to  the  7  items  'Modified  Himmelsbach  Withdrawal  Scale' (rhinorrhea, tremor, piloerection, yawning, restlessness, perspiration, and lacrimation) did not reveal consistent differences between the treatment groups, indicating that MNTX is not causing clinically relevant opioid withdrawal symptoms.

## -Laxative use

The  evaluation  of  laxatives  use  in  the  two  pivotal  studies  did  not  reveal  differences  between treatment  groups.  Almost  all  of  the  patients  used  laxatives  at  inclusion  and  the  use  of  laxatives increased to 100% during the course of the study, in both treatment groups. Interestingly, the use of enemas increased  relative  to  baseline  from  14  to  35%  in  the  placebo,  and  from  12  to  24%  in  the MNTX group respectively. It is also interesting to note that a general shift in the type of laxatives was observed during the study to the increased use of osmotic agents in the placebo group (from 33.8% to 40.8%) in comparison to MNTX (30.2% to 33.3%).

## · Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Given the described differences between the studies, the applicant was not able to perform a complete meta-analysis of the submitted data. However, the results for the primary endpoint ('% of patients with  laxation  within  4  hours  after  administration  of  first  double-blind  dose  of  study  drug')  were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pooled for the two main studies (MNTX 301 and MNTX 302), and this analysis was also used to exclude any relevant effect of age or gender on overall efficacy, as shown in the following table.

Table 14: Number (%) of patients with laxation within 4 hours after administration of first double-  blind dose of study drug (studies MNTX 302, 301) - by age and sex.

| Male            | 6/59 ( 10.2)            | 43/83 (51.8)        |

Additionally, these results were also analyzed using logistic regressions with sex, age, and baseline opioid use as covariates, as shown in the following table:

From this evaluation, it was concluded that age and gender did not have influence on the response rates.

## · Clinical studies in special populations

No such studies were performed. The target patient population is a special patient population in itself.

## · Supportive study(ies)

One  supportive  study  was  conducted  as  an  open-label  3-month  extension  of  study  MNTX  302, performed to obtain long-term safety and efficacy data.

Enrolment into the study had to be performed within 28 days of the completion of MNTX 302.

All patients had to begin treatment with the dose of 0.15 mg/kg. Dosing was to be performed on an 'as needed' basis for up to 3 months. The investigators were permitted to increase the dose to 0.30 mg/kg, or to decrease it to 0.075 mg/kg at any time in order to achieve the desired clinical effect, or to ameliorate adverse effects. The highest permitted dose therefore was defined as 0.30 mg/kg per day.

Efficacy was assessed by bowel movement response (laxation response) as well as by the patients' evaluations  of  consistency,  and  difficulty  of  bowel  movements  and  constipation  distress,  together with the global ratings of patients and investigators. Withdrawal symptoms and assessment of pain were also recorded. All these parameters were recorded with the same methods as in study MNTX 302.

The following parameters were assessed on a daily basis: Bowel movement (including consistency and difficulty), concomitant medication and adverse events. Other parameters of efficacy and safety were  only  evaluated  on  a  monthly  basis:  Global  clinical  impression  of  change  (GCIC),  pain evaluation, modified Himmelsbach scale, evaluation of constipation, adverse events, and concomitant medication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Laxation responses were evaluated as patient response rate (number of doses with laxation response divided by total number of doses taken) and as dose response rate (number of doses with laxations response divided by total number of doses taken for all patients combined).

Other efficacy evaluations included the time to laxation onset, changes in stool consistency and in bowel  movement  difficulty,  changes  in  pain  scores  and  opioid  withdrawal  symptoms,  the  GCIC ratings, and the use of rescue laxative medication.

Of the 107 patients that completed protocol MNTX 302, 82 were included in the extension phase. Of these, only 32 completed the whole 3 months treatment period.

The  highest  numbers  of  discontinuation  occurred  due  to  death  on  study,  a  finding  that  was  not unexpected considering the included patient population.

Among those  patients  that  requested  withdrawal  themselves,  2  withdrew  before  receiving  the  first dose, and 9 (=approx. 10%) (4 from the former placebo group and 5 from the former MNTX group) withdrew due to unresponsiveness.

The two subsets of patients were quite similar regarding baseline characteristics and did not differ to a clinically relevant level as compared to the groups included in the double-blind phase of the study.

Overall, patients in the extension who continued to receive MNTX maintained the responses they had attained during double-blind treatment, and those patients who switched from double-blind placebo to open-label  MNTX  attained  and  maintained  responses  similar  to  those  produced  by  double-blind MNTX.

The median time to rescue-free laxation response remained fairly constant over time with 0.60 hours at the beginning of the study and fluctuating between 0.42 and 0.73 hours.

The  assessment  of  stool  consistency  was  again  only  assessed  with  uninstructive  tables  of  shifts, however, with the figure of watery stools remaining at a fairly low level of 11%.

The overall rate of 'moderate, considerable or great' difficulties after any of the 736 doses that led to a  rescue-free  laxation  within  4  hours  was  given  with  33.0%,  which  is  identical  to  the  rate  in  the MNTX group in the double-blind phase of the study, and lower than the rate for placebo (50%).

Constipation  distress  was  also  again  evaluated  by  tables  of  shifts  that  were  likewise  not  easy  to interpret. The number of patients with absence of constipation distress were 45% on day 1 (4 hours after administration of the first dose), 27% after 4 weeks of treatment, with 18% after 8 weeks, and 18% after 12 weeks.

The  use  of  laxatives  during  the  course  of  the  study  was  again  monitored,  with  contact  laxatives (89%), softeners, emollients (48%), and osmotically acting laxatives (38%) being the most commonly used drug classes. The frequency of enema use was still 31.7%.

There was overall little change in the pain scores throughout the course of the open-label extension. Likewise, there were no meaningful changes in mean or median values or in the range of changes of the  total  or  single  items  of  the  Himmelsbach  score  for  the  measurement  of  withdrawal  symptoms. Less  than  5%  of  patients  shifted  from  'none'  or  'mild'  at  baseline  to  'moderate'  and  no  patients shifted to a severe rating for yawning and lacrimation. On the other hand, maximally 2 patients had such a shift for the other five items of the scale.

In conclusions, the results of the double-blind phase of the study were confirmed, and it was shown that efficacy could be maintained over a three-month period of time without causing an increase in pain scores or withdrawal symptoms.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

The clinical studies performed - 1 phase 2 and 2 phase 3 studies -proved that MNTX is reliably able to induce a relatively prompt laxation in patients that are already treated with laxatives for opioid induced constipation and have ongoing difficulties with defecation.

The  patients  included  were  receiving  palliative  opioid  therapy  for  various  advanced  illnesses,  the majority being cancer. Most of the patients had a WHO performance status of 3 or 4. However, the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

population investigated was rather small, and the duration of the double-blind phases of the performed studies was limited.

There  was  furthermore  some  indication  that  the  compound  relieves  defecation  complaints  and improves stool consistency over the short term, leading to an overall patient satisfaction that is clearly distinct from placebo.

Open label extension studies showed that the a.m. effects can be maintained up to three months.

Among the  concerns  that  were  identified  during  assessment  from  the  overall  clinical  development programme, the following are of note:

- The primary efficacy criteria used in the main clinical studies appeared to investigate the use of the drug  as  a  rescue  medication  on  top  of  the  current  'standard  of  care',  rather  than  the  continuous treatment of constipation aiming at normalisation of bowel movement frequency, stool consistency and defecation complaints. Therefore, the intended indication 'opioid induced constipation' was put under question and it was suggested to replace it with an expression more adequately reflecting the 'emergency'-type  use  of  the  drug  (e.g.  'Induction  of  laxation  in  patients  with  opioid  bowel dysfunction  with  inappropriate  treatment  response  to  conventional  laxatives  and  with  advanced illness'). In order to elucidate whether a regular 'treatment of obstipation' could be achieved by the compound,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  perform  a  re-analysis  of  'responders'  according  to  the following criteria:
- -normal bowel movement frequency (e.g. no constipation = at least 3 bowel movements per week
- -normal stool consistency (assessment of stool as 2, 3, or 4 on the scale used)
- -no relevant defecation symptoms ('difficulty to pass stool' ratings 1 and 2 on the scale used)

This explorative analysis was also to be presented comparing the more severely affected population with the less severely affected patients.

The re-analyses resulted in the following:

Responder defined as: ≥ 3 bowel movements/week with majority (≥ 50%) of stools reported as soft to slightly hard, and no or slight defecation difficulty

These analyses were considered overall reassuring in that the more severe the constipation symptoms appeared to be, the higher response could be expected from the treatment with MNTX. However, the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

re-analysis did not lead to a similar reassurance for patients with mild constipation at baseline. This has  been  reflected  in  the  SPC  (section  5.1),  which  specifies  that  'stool  consistency  was  not meaningfully improved in patients who had soft stools at baseline'.

· Most of the patients were included on the sole criterion of 'delayed' defecation of more than 48 hours, without a clear definition of the three items that define the term constipation; i.e. reduced frequency, increased consistency and difficulties with defecation.

However, the vast majority of patients in the pivotal trials did report less than 3 bowel movements for the  week  prior  to  randomization,  clearly  demonstrating  that  these  patients  had  decreased  bowel movement frequency. Moreover, most reported substantial constipation distress, and a high degree of defecation difficulty, and many reported hard stool consistencies at baseline as well, suggesting that they adequately represent a population with substantial constipation severity, which is the intended patient population. Overall, all patients in the pivotal trials were terminally ill, were on high dose of opioids, and were identified by their clinicians as having opioid induced constipation. Despite a bowel regimen with a median of two laxatives, these patients had not had a bowel movement in at least 48 hours. Moreover, the overall life expectancy of the patients enrolled in the studies was consistent with a  judgement  of  a  median  survival  less  than  6  months.  As  a  result,  it  was  agreed  to  restrict  the indication to patients with limited life expectancy in palliative care.

· Results from the dose finding study MNTX 251 led to concerns over the 0.15 mg/kg and 0.30 mg/kg doses chosen for the main efficacy studies, as these doses initially appeared to be inappropriate to find the lowest effective dose in clinical practice. The applicant presented dose-response profiles suggesting that the 0.15 mg/kg dose (or not much lower) is likely to be the lowest dose at which the maximum response rate for s.c. MNTX could still be attained. Also, from the 90% confidence limit it appeared that, as expected based on the sample size, the response rates obtained with doses of 0.02, 0.08, 0.2 and 0.33 mg/kg carried considerably greater uncertainty than those with placebo, and doses of 0.15 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg. Overall, the 0.15 mg/kg dose seemed to provide an acceptable balance between efficacy and GI tolerability.

· The recommended dose of methylnaltrexone bromide reported in the SPC is 8 mg (0.4mL) for patients  weighing  38-61  kg  or  12  mg  (0.6mL)  for  patients  weighing  62-114  kg.  The  fixed  dose regimen with the two strengths proposed by the applicant for the chosen weight bands was considered appropriate.  The  notion  of  fixed  dose  is  in  fact  highly  preferable  both  for  ease  of  use  and  for decreasing  the  risk  of  administering  the  wrong  dose.  However,  it  remained  unclear  whether  the proposal of treatment weight-related dosing of 0.15 mg/kg for subjects above or below these weight bands was still appropriate. Ultimately, no safety concerns were identified for patients weighting less than 38 kgs (for whom there is a risk on under-dosing), whereas the risk of overdosing for patients above 114 kgs was associated with (dose-related) higher risk of abdominal pain and dizziness, which were however mild adverse events. Thus, it was demonstrated that the treatment proposal for patients outside the chosen weight bands was acceptable.

In  order  to  permit  the  proper  assessment  of  the  doses  administered  in  both  efficacy  studies,  the applicant was asked to present results of subgroups receiving oral, transdermal and intratechal therapy as well as the characterisation and results of the different subgroups receiving different substances or groups  of  substances  (with  potentially  differential  potential  for  obstipation,  e.g.  methadone  or fentanyl, or with differences of binding capacity to the receptor). An overview on the further course of opioid intake during the course of Study MNTX 302 and its extension phases, together with their possible  impact  on  response  rates,  was  also  requested.  The  applicant  responded  that  it  was  not possible  to  analyse  the  data  by  subgrouping  into  patients  receiving  oral,  transdermal  or  intratechal opioids, as there were only few patients receiving transdermal or intratechal opioids without receiving also  oral  opioids.  It  was  therefore  agreed  that  the  number  of  patients  was  too  low  to  allow  for  an analysis  by  subgrouping.  Ultimately,  it  was  demonstrated  that  MNTX  efficacy  was  significantly superior to placebo regardless of the opioid dose employed.

## Clinical safety

The safety of methylnaltrexone was investigated in six phase 1 studies, one phase 2 study and two phase  3  studies  with  open  label  extensions.  Subcutaneous  methylnaltrexone  was  investigated  in studies MNTX 103, MNTX 1105, MNTX 1106, MNTX 1107, MNTX 251, MNTX 301, and MNTX

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

302. All of these studies were complete at the time of the data cut off (1 September 2006), when there was one other ongoing, open-label, compassionate use study with s.c. methylnaltrexone.

Long  term  safety  data  referring  to  treatments  longer  than  3  month  are  not  available.  Safety  data referring to the maximally proposed dosing of 1 dose/day are also not available. In studies MNTX 301/301 EXT  and MNTX  302  EXT  the dosing interval between two administrations of methylnaltrexone was 3.6 day and 6.0 days respectively, with a range of 1 to 14 days in study MNTX 301/301 EXT and 2 to 40 days in study MNTX 302 EXT. Likewise the placebo-controlled phases of these studies only investigated a single-dose or a QOD dosing (for two weeks).

## · Adverse events

Adverse events were counted as treatment-emergent for the placebo controlled and double blind pools if they occurred 1) at any time between administration of the first dose of study drug and the start of open label methylnaltrexone treatment for patients who received open label treatment, or 2) at any time between administration of the first dose of study drug and 30 days after the last dose of study drug  for  patients  who  received  only  double  blind  treatment.  Adverse  events  were  counted  as treatment-emergent  for  the  methylnaltrexone  exposure  pool  if  they  occurred  at  any  time  between administration of the first dose and the last dose of methylnaltrexone.

In  the  methylnaltrexone  overall  pool,  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  occurred  in  97.9%  of  the patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  methylnaltrexone.  The  incidence  of  adverse  events  was highest within the system organ class 'Gastrointestinal disorders' (73.8%) and 'General disorders and administration  site  conditions'  (54.5%).  The  most  frequent  events  were  abdominal  pain  (39.2%), nausea  (22.4%),  vomiting  (18.5%),  flatulence  (17.8%),  diarrhoea  12.8%,  pain  (15.4%),  peripheral oedema (14.3%), malignant neoplasm progression (31.8%), anxiety (15%), confusional state (12.6%), restlessness 11.2%, dyspnoea 12.2%, and hyperhidrosis (13.3%).

In  the  placebo-controlled  pool  treatment  emergent  adverse  events occured in 67.5% of the patients who  received  placebo  and  80.6%  of  the  patients  who  received  methylnaltrexone  in  the  placebo

Abbreviation:MNTX=methylnaltrexone.

Data on adverse events from the double blind treatment studies are limited. The rate of adverse events within  the  system  organ  classes  'Gastrointestinal  disorders'  and  'Nervous  system  disorders'  was higher  in  the  methylnaltrexone  group  than  in  the  placebo  group.  Specifically,  abdominal  pain occurred in 28.5% of patients treated with methylnaltrexone but only in 9.8% of patients treated with placebo.  The  same  trend  could  be  observed  for  flatulence  (13.3%  versus  5.7%),  diarrhoea  (5.5% versus 2.4%) and nausea (11.5% versus 4.9%). The rate for dizziness was 7.3% in the methylnaltrexone group and 2.4% in the placebo group. For all other adverse events the event rates were comparable in both groups. The severity of adverse events was comparable in the methylnaltrexone and the placebo group. The incidence of adverse events was in general not different in the two  active treatment groups  (methylnaltrexone  0.15mg/kg  and  0.30mg/kg).  However, abdominal pain occurred in 38.2% of the patients in the 0.30mg/kg dose group and in 23.6% of the patients in the 0.15mg/kg dose group. As described in the efficacy section, data from patients treated with lower doses of methylnaltrexone were not available for the placebo controlled population.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

At least 1 fatal serious adverse event occurred in 11 (8.9%) of the placebo-treated patients and in 2 (1.2%) of the methylnaltrexone-treated patients in the placebo controlled pool, and in 11 (8.9%) of the placebo-treated patients and in 5 (2.5%) of the methylnaltrexone-treated patients in the double blind pool.

Within the methylnaltrexone exposure pool, serious adverse events occurred in 57 (19.9%) of the 286 treated  patients.  The  most  commonly  reported  events  were  nausea,  vomiting  and  chest  pain,  each occurring  in  4  (1.4%)  patients.  None  of  the  subjects  in  the  healthy  volunteers  pool  had  a  serious adverse event.

The frequency of serious adverse events was relatively low with regard to the special study population with  a  life  expectancy  lower  than  6  month.  Higher  incidences  in  comparison  to  placebo-treated patients could not be observed in the double blind treatment pool.

No subject in a phase 1 study died. In the placebo controlled pool, 18 (14.6%) of the 123 placebotreated patients and 16 (9.7%) of the 165 methylnaltrexone-treated patients died during or after the study. In the double blind pool, 18 (14.6%) of the 123 placebo-treated patients and 23 (11.6%) of the 198  methylnaltrexone-treated  patients  died  during  or  after  the  study.  The  death  reported  for  these

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

populations either occurred during the double blind treatment or were reported at the 30-day follow up contact for a patient who did not enter an open label study.

Of the 286 patients in the methylnaltrexone exposure pool, 140 (49.0%) died. The median survival was estimated at 70 days. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve based on combined double blind and open label treatment for all patients in the phase 2 and phase 3 studies is presented below (Figure 2). The survival of patients who received methylnaltrexone was no worse than that of patients who received placebo.

Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier survival curve by double-blind/open label treatment.

Death was the most frequently reported reason for premature discontinuation. A higher incidence of death due to the administration of methylnaltrexone could not be observed.

## · Laboratory findings

The  incidence  of  adverse  events  related  to  abnormal  laboratory  test  results  was  low  in  both  the placebo and the methylnaltrexone treated patients. This applies for the double blind and also for the open label studies as well as for study MNTX 203 (intravenous administration).

## · Safety in special populations

## Renal impairment

Study MNTX 1105 enrolled subjects with renal impairment. Two of eight subjects with mild renal impairment had adverse events (fatigue and paresthesia). One of eight subjects with moderate renal impairment had adverse events (diarrhoea, dyspepsia, and injection site stinging). One of 8 subjects with severe renal impairment had adverse events (dyspepsia, headache, hot flush, and vomiting). The events  were  all  mild  to  moderate  in  intensity.  For  the  double  blind  pool  and  the  methylnaltrexone exposure pool of the controlled clinical studies there was no consistent pattern of increasing rates of adverse events in patients with impaired renal function.

The incidence of adverse events did not increase in patients with impaired renal function.

As described in  the  pharmacokinetic  section,  the  total  exposure  with  methylnaltrexone  was  almost doubled in patients with moderately impaired renal function. The incidence of adverse events did not increase in patients with severely impaired renal function. As a result, the applicant's proposal to half the dose in patients with severely impaired renal function was considered acceptable.

As  demonstrated  in  study  MNTX  1107,  hepatic  impairment  had  no  clear  effect  on  the  PK  of methylnaltrexone.  ALT  and  AST  increased  in  one  of  eight  patients  with  mild  hepatic  impairment. Adverse events data of the methylnaltrexone exposure pool were not provided.

## Other special populations

Age, gender,  and  underlying  disease  had  no  significant  influence  on  the  frequency  and  severity  of adverse events.

## · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Please  see  the  Clinical  Pharmacokinetic  section  for  the  principal  conclsusions  regarding  drug interactions.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

Adverse events were cited as the reason for discontinuation in 2.4% of the placebo-treated patients and 1.5% of the methylnaltrexone-treated patients within the double blind pool. In the methylnaltrexone exposure pool adverse events were cited as the reason for discontinuation in 3.6% of the patients.

The  most  common  reason  for  premature  discontinuation  was  death.  The  reason  for  death  was  in general  the  progressive  underlying  disease  in  this  population  with  a  life  expectancy  of  less  than  6 month. The only adverse event that led to discontinuation in more than one patient was abdominal pain.

## · Post marketing experience

Methylnaltrexone bromide has never been marketed. Therefore, no post-marketing data are available.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

The  safety  outstanding  issues  outlined  below  (concerning  the  maximum  recommended  dose,  the possibility  of  self-administration,  and  the  occurrence  of  watery  stools)  were  considered  during  the evaluation  procedure,  requesting  further  clarification  from  the  applicant.  They  were  re-solved  as follows:

- -Maximum  recommended  dose:  A  total  of  155  subjects  received  consecutive  daily  doses  of MNTX.  Because  of  the  therapeutical  dilemma  -  no  bowel  movement  following  the  first administration of MNTX and concomitant standard laxative treatment in a palliative care setting -  the  applicant's  position  that  patients  may  receive  two  consecutive  doses  24  hours  apart  was considered  acceptable,  but  only  in  exceptional  circumstances  (only  when  there  has  been  no bowel movement response to the dose on the preceding day). It was agreed that the interval of 48 hours between doses should be adhered to thereafter, and that daily use should be discouraged. This information is clearly reflected in the SPC.

The applicant submitted a summary of the safety and tolerability and of the treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in patients receiving consecutive doses of MNTX in the pivotal studies. Overall, there was no increase of the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events in patients receiving a consecutive dose, both in study 301/301 EXT  and study 302/302 EXT. Gastrointestinal disorders were also comparable. Serious adverse events in patients who received consecutive  day  dosing  in  these  studies  did  not  seem  to  be  related  to  the  frequency  of administration. However, it was noted that one patient received MNTX on 4 consecutive days, and this is to be discouraged.

-Regarding a possible self administration of the compound, the applicant was asked to clarify what educational programme/documentation (apart from the instructions already included in the SPC) is to be used to educate the patients and healthcare professionals, and was asked to provide samples of these material. The applicant was also asked to further describe whether the product will be available with a conventional needle or with a retractable one.

The applicant provided satisfactory clarifications on the product's packages that are to be made available and on the safety mechanism of the single use syringe to be used. Clarifications were provided also on the launch and pre-launch activities foreseen.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  applicant's  proposal  was  considered  acceptable.  All  advertising  and  patient  information material  will  be  vetted  upon  approval.  In  addition,  the  notion  that  this  product  is  for  use  in palliative care only will be made clear.

- -Following the CHMP request at day 120 of the procedure, the applicant presented additional data regarding the occurrence of watery stools, comparing placebo and active treatment. A differential evaluation according to MNTX dose was also requested, in order to allow for the evaluation of a possible dose-response relationship.

Data on whether there was a dose effect on the production of watery stools in the MNTX studies were assessed from the following 4 sources: MNTX 301 (double-blind), MNTX 302, MNTX 301 (open-label) and MNTX 301 EXT, and MNTX 302 EXT.

Overall, across all studies, there was no meaningful dose effect in the production of watery stool, with  the  possible  exception  of  the  first  dose.  In  particular,  the  data  of  study  302  EXT  (table below),  including  nearly  2500  bowel  movements,  demonstrated  that  the  occurrence  of  watery stool is independent of the MNTX dose.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considers that the Pharmacovigilance System as described by the applicant fulfils most of the  requirements  as  described  in  Volume  9A  of  the  Rules  Governing  Medicinal  Products  in  the European Union.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan.

The RMP provided by the MAH is considered adequate by formal criteria. Based on preclinical and clinical  data  the  risks  associated  with  use  of  RELISTOR  in  general  seem  moderate.  However,  the patient  pool  on  which  this  estimation  is  based  is  rather  small.  Therefore,  amendments of the RMP were considered.

As potential risks requiring further evaluation the applicant has identified the following:

- Potential  for  off-label  use [rationale:  the  population  of  patients  requiring  chronic  opioid treatment  (e.g.  chronic  pain  patients,  etc)  exceeds  the  population  indicated  for  use  of methylnaltrexone. This situation will facilitate the off-label use of methylnaltrexone]
- Potential  for  misuse [rationale:  opioid  drug  addicts  with  constipation  may  benefit  from methylnaltrexone-treatment, and therefore may be treated off-label with methylnaltrexone]
- Potential for medication error [rationale: the application form (subcutaneous injection) and the  conditions  of  its  use  (palliative  home  care,  etc.)  may  facilitate  the  occurrence  of medication errors with methylnaltrexone, especially false intraveneous injections and overdosing]

The identified and potential risks described by the applicant, as well as the methods proposed in order to monitor and minimize these risks, are considered adequate.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The finished product was developed as a solution for injection for subcutaneous use. The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain a stable product at room temperature.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Overall the primary PD studies provided adequate evidence that methylnaltrexone bromide effectively antagonises the opioid-induced inhibition of gastrointestinal function, with generally no effect on the opioid-induced analgesia.

PK data revealed that bioavailability was essentially complete after s.c. dosing and very low after oral administration.  RELISTOR  showed  a  moderate  to  high  plasma  clearance  compared  to  liver  blood flow  and  apparent  volume  of  distribution.  The  highest  concentration  of  RELISTOR  in  tissue  was reached  within  1  hour,  with  small  intestine,  liver  and  kidney  with  the  highest  and  brain  with  the lowest concentration. Afterwards the concentration in most tissues decreased, although the tissue-toplasma ratios increased for 12 hours, indicating much faster plasma than tissue clearance. RELISTOR binding  to  plasma  proteins  was  shown  to  be  minimal.  In  all  species  investigated  metabolism  was limited, with the main compound in excreta being RELISTOR. RELISTOR was excreted via faeces and  urine  in  all  species  after  oral  and  systemic  administration.  It  was  shown  that  RELISTOR  is  a substrate  of  the  human  organic  cation  transporters.  Although  RELISTOR  is  a  relevant  substrate  of CYP 2D6 and the human organic cation transporters, no clinically relevant interactions with these drugs were assumed.

General  signs  of  toxicity  reported  during  toxicology  studies  were  abnormal  gait  and  stance,  low carriage, body tremors and labored respiration. The single dose toxicity studies exhibited a relatively low acute toxicity. The main clinical signs of RELISTOR exposure at high doses in the repeat dose toxicity studies were  tremors,  convulsion,  decreased  activity,  abnormal  stance  and  gait,  and prostration  in  rats  as  well  as  in  dogs.  In  addition,  in  dogs  also  ptosis,  bloodshot  eyes,  protruding nictitating membranes, dilated pupils and absence of menstrual cycling were apparent.

No changes of macroscopic, microscopic and clinical chemistry parameters were described.

The  studies performed  did  not  bring  evidence  for  clinically relevant genotoxic  potential of RELISTOR. Milk and placental transfer of RELISTOR were shown after subcutaneous administration in rats; in this species high doses of RELISTOR also appeared to impair fertility.

No  separate  local  tolerance  studies  were  performed;  the  studies  performed  with  subcutaneous administration  showed  an  acceptable  local  tolerance,  although  a  significant  influence  of  the formulation was demonstrated in the repeated dose studies.

In conclusion, the use of RELISTOR was not considered to pose a risk to the environment.

## Efficacy

Results from the pivotal studies performed showed the clear superiority of RELISTOR over placebo in  the  induction  of  prompt  laxation  in  patients  that  are  already  treated  with  laxatives  for  opioid induced constipation and have ongoing difficulties with defecation.

Laxation within 4 hours after the first dose of study drug was observed in 48.4% (CI = 35.9-60.8) of patients in the RELISTOR group versus 15.5% (CI = 7.1-23.9) of patients in the placebo group. The proportion of patients with ≥ 2 laxations within 4 hours after dose administration over the first 4 doses was 51.6% (CI = 39.2-64.1) in the RELISTOR group and 8.5% (CI = 2.0-14.9) in the placebo group. The secondary endpoints were generally in support of the primary endpoints.

It was recognised that the population investigated was rather small, and that also the duration of the double-blind phases of the performed studies was limited.

In  addition,  there  was  some  indication  that  the  compound  relieves  defecation  complaints  and improves stool consistency over the short term, leading to an overall patient satisfaction that is clearly distinct from placebo.

Open label extension studies showed that the a.m. effects can be maintained up to three months.

## Safety

Data provided on adverse events were limited. The rate of adverse events within the system organ classes 'Gastrointestinal disorders' and 'Nervous system disorders' (i.e. abdominal pain, flatulence, diarrhoea, nausea, and dizziness) was higher in the methylnaltrexone group than in the placebo group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Serious  adverse  events  occurred  in  19.9%  of  the  overall  population  of  patients  exposed  to RELISTOR. In the double-blind treatment pool the frequency of serious adverse event was 8.9% for placebo and 2.5% for RELISTOR.

The most commonly reported events were abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting and flatulence. The healthy  volunteer  subjects  investigated  did  not  show  any  serious  adverse  event.  The  frequency  of serious  adverse  events  was  relatively  low  with  regard  to  the  special  study  population  with  a  life expectancy lower than 6 months.

The incidence of adverse events did not increase in patients with impaired renal function. The total exposure  with  RELISTOR  resulted  almost  doubled  in  patients  with  moderately  impaired  renal function. The incidence of adverse events did not increase in patients with severely impaired renal function.  From  the  data  provided,  no  clear  effect  of  hepatic  impairment  on  the  PK  of  RELISTOR could  be  observed.  Finally  age,  gender  and  underlying  disease  had  no  significant  influence  on frequency and severity of adverse events.

## Benefit/risk assessment

RELISTOR clearly showed that a prompt induction  of  laxation  is  possible  in  patients  with  opioid induced  constipation  still  having  significant  constipation  problems  on  top  of  'usual'  laxative treatment.  This  was  shown  to  improve  patient  satisfaction  with  defecation  habits,  to  improve  stool consistency to some extent, and possibly also to relieve some of the associated symptoms. There was also  some  indication  that  the  use  of  rectally  administered  laxatives  can  be  reduced  compared  to placebo. Moreover,  explorative analysis showed  that  the compound  was  also  able  to  relief constipation  in  a  'conventional'  sense  with  a  composite  beneficial  influence  on  stool  consistency, stool frequency, and defecation difficulties in patients with a high degree of constipation. However, a possible  reduction  of  overall  'usual  laxative  medication'  could  not  convincingly  be  shown.  As  a result, the proven benefits of the compound appeared to be limited to some extent.

The number of patients treated with RELISTOR in clinical studies was limited, and only very few patients were treated with the product for more than 4 weeks. In addition, the patients included in the clinical  studies  had  a  life  expectancy  between 1 and 6 month with the consequence of a very high withdrawal rate due to death.

The administration of RELISTOR for the short term treatment of constipation in patients with a life expectancy between 1 and 6 month seemed to be safe. The adverse events referred particularly to the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. abdominal pain, nausea) and the nervous system (e.g. dizziness) and were in general mild or moderate in severity.

Safety data of long term treatment were missing and therefore the treatment with RELISTOR should be restricted to the patient population evaluated in clinical studies (that is mentioned above).

The applicant identified a potential off-label use, potential misuse and possible medication errors to be potential risks that require further evaluation. The potential risks identified and described by the applicant,  as  well  as  the  methods  proposed  in  order  to  monitor  and  minimize  these  risks,  were considered adequate.

The benefits of the treatment, being rather symptomatic in nature, were considered to be sufficient for approval because the risks appeared to be limited, especially regarding serious and severe undesirable effects. Although the number of patients evaluated was small and the treatment duration was limited, adequate  measures  were  proposed  to  ensure  that  the  compound  is  only  used  for  no  longer  than  3 months,  and  in  the  investigated  patient  population  only.  The  Risk-Benefit  balance  was  therefore considered positive.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  decision  that  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of  RELISTOR  in  the  'treatment  of  opioid-induced constipation  in  advanced  illness  patients  who  are  receiving  palliative  care  when  response  to  usual laxative therapy has not been sufficient' was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
