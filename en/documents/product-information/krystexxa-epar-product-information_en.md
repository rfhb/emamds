ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

KRYSTEXXA 8 mg concentrate for solution for infusion

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each vial contains 8 mg of pegloticase (8 mg/ml concentrate). The strength indicates the quantity of the uricase moiety of pegloticase without consideration of the PEGylation.

The active substance pegloticase is a covalent conjugate of uricase produced by a genetically modified strain of Escherichia coli and monomethoxypoly (ethylene glycol). The potency of this product should not be compared to the one of another pegylated or non-pegylated protein of the same therapeutic class. For the full list of excipients see section 6.1 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Concentrate for solution for infusion. Clear to slightly opalescent, colourless solution at pH 7.3±0.3. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications KRYSTEXXA is indicated for the treatment of severe debilitating chronic tophaceous gout in adult patients who may also have erosive joint involvement and who have failed to normalize serum uric acid with xanthine oxidase inhibitors at the maximum medically appropriate dose or for whom these medicines are contraindicated (see section 4.4). The decision to treat with KRYSTEXXA should be based on an on-going assessment of the benefits and risks for the individual patient (see section 4.4). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of severe refractory chronic gout. The medicinal product should be administered in a healthcare setting and by healthcare professionals prepared to manage anaphylaxis and infusion reactions. Close monitoring is required during the infusion and for at least 2 hours after the end of the infusion. Availability of resuscitation equipment must be ensured. Delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Posology

The recommended dose is 8 mg pegloticase given as an intravenous infusion every two weeks.

Prior to infusion, patients should receive pre-medication to minimize the risk of infusion-related reactions, e.g. antihistamine the evening before, and again approximately 30 minutes before the infusion, as well as paracetamol and a corticosteroid immediately before each infusion (see section 4.4) .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Monitoring of serum uric acid level is required prior to each infusion. KRYSTEXXA should not be administered if two consecutive levels above 6 mg/dl (360 µmol/L) have been measured (see section 4.4).

Before starting the treatment and especially before monitoring the serum uric acid levels, patients should discontinue oral urate-lowering medication and not institute therapy with oral urate-lowering medication while taking KRYSTEXXA (see section 4.4).

The optimal treatment duration has not been established (see section 4.4). The duration of treatment should be based upon maintenance of response (serum uric acid levels &lt; 6 mg/dl) and clinical judgment.

The data for long-term treatment from controlled clinical studies are limited. This should be considered when the decision is made for a therapy longer than 6 months.

Patients with renal impairment Based on similar efficacy and safety profiles of pegloticase in patients with creatinine clearance below and above 50 ml/min, no dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). Elderly patients No dose adjustment is needed for patients 65 years of age and older (see section 5.2). Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of KRYSTEXXA in children and adolescents aged below 18 years has not been established. No data are available. Method of administration KRYSTEXXA, once diluted with 250 ml of sodium chloride solution, 4.5 mg/ml (0.45%) or 9 mg/ml (0.9%), is administered as an intravenous infusion over no less than 2 hours, at a flow rate of approximately 2 ml/minute. For instructions on the preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and other cellular metabolic disorders known to cause haemolysis and methemoglobinemia. All patients at higher risk for G6PD deficiency (e.g., patients of African or Mediterranean ancestry) should be screened for G6PD deficiency before starting KRYSTEXXA. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use The benefit/risk balance should be assessed for each individual patient on an on-going basis considering the effect on tophus resolution as well as the risk of infusion reactions, gout flares, and potentially increased cardiac risk. The long-term risk of prophylactic medications to prevent infusion reactions, such as glucocorticoids, should also be taken into consideration. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Infusion-related reactions / Anaphylaxis

KRYSTEXXA can induce severe allergic responses, including anaphylactic shock with cardiac arrest. Special attention is recommended for patients with pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease.

Patients should be pre-treated with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and paracetamol, and closely monitored for the onset of adverse reactions suggesting severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis for at least 1 hour after the end of the infusion (see section 4.8). If an infusion reaction

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

occurs during the administration, the infusion may be slowed, or stopped and restarted at a slower rate, at the discretion of the physician.

Most infusion-related reactions have been observed after loss of therapeutic response due to the development of anti-pegloticase antibodies, i.e. when serum uric acid values were above 6 mg/dl (360 µmol/L). Therefore, monitoring of serum uric acid level is required prior to each infusion. KRYSTEXXA should be discontinued if 2 consecutive levels above 6 mg/dl have been measured.

Since concomitant use of oral urate-lowering therapy may potentially mask the rise of serum uric acid associated with the loss of response, patients taking concomitant oral urate-lowering therapy may be at increased risk of infusion reactions and/or anaphylaxis. It is therefore recommended to discontinue oral urate-lowering medications before starting treatment and not institute therapy with oral uratelowering agents while taking KRYSTEXXA.

Acute gouty attacks (gout flare) An increase in gout flares is frequently observed upon treatment initiation, probably as a result of mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. To reduce the likelihood of gout flares after initiation of KRYSTEXXA prophylaxis with colchicine or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) is recommended. It is recommended to start this treatment 1 week before initiation of KRYSTEXXA and continue for at least 6 months, unless medically contraindicated or not tolerated. KRYSTEXXA does not need to be interrupted because of a gout flare, which should be managed concurrently as appropriate for the individual patient. Continuous treatment with pegloticase decreases frequency and intensity of gout flares. Congestive heart failure KRYSTEXXA has not been formally studied in patients with congestive heart failure, but a small number of patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions who were treated with pegloticase in the clinical trials had exacerbations of their congestive heart failure. Caution should be exercised in patients who have congestive heart failure and patients should be monitored closely following infusion. Haemolysis and/or Methemoglobinemia If haemolysis and/or methemoglobinemia occur in patients receiving KRYSTEXXA, treatment should be immediately and permanently discontinued and appropriate measures initiated. Patients over 100 kg body weight Lower response rates were observed in patients over 100 kg BW; however, confounding factors in a small sample size make it unclear if in patients over 100 kg BW the dose was optimal to achieve an effect. Also, high titres of anti-pegloticase antibodies and infusion-related reactions showed a tendency to occur in a greater proportion of patients in this weight group (see section 4.8). Retreatment with KRYSTEXXA Very limited data are available about retreatment after interruption of therapy for more than 4 weeks. Because of the immunogenicity of KRYSTEXXA, patients receiving retreatment may be at increased risk of infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis. It is therefore recommended that patients given repeat infusions of KRYSTEXXA after a treatment interruption be monitored carefully. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Sodium intake

KRYSTEXXA contains 4.2 mg sodium (less than 1 mmol) per dose (essentially sodium free).

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As anti-pegloticase antibodies can bind to the PEG moiety of KRYSTEXXA, there may be potential for binding to other PEGylated products. It is unknown whether the development of anti-PEG antibodies may reduce the efficacy of other PEGylated medicinal products.

## 4.6 Fertility, Pregnancy and Lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use in pregnant women. The embryofetal development study in rats does not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. The results of the on-going reproductive toxicity studies are not available (see section 5.3). KRYSTEXXA is not recommended during pregnancy.

Breast-feeding It is unknown whether pegloticase or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Therefore, KRYSTEXXA should not be used during breast-feeding unless the clear benefit to the mother can overcome the unknown risk to the newborn/infant. Fertility Effect on male and female fertility has not been studied. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines KRYSTEXXA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients experience treatment-related symptoms affecting their ability to concentrate and react (i.e. headache or dizziness), it is recommended that they do not drive or use machines until the effect subsides. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety profile In controlled clinical trials, the most commonly reported serious adverse reactions were anaphylaxis, which occurred at a frequency of 6.5% (8/123) in patients treated with 8 mg every 2 weeks; infusion reactions, which occurred at a frequency of 26% and gout flares, which were more common during the first 3 months of treatment. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The following convention has been used for classification of the adverse reactions reported in the Phase 3 clinical trials (see Table 1 below): very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000), very rare (&lt;1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping and system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Table 1.  Adverse Reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions Infusion-related reactions Infusion-related reactions can occur after initiation of any infusion, in spite of patients being premedicated with oral antihistamine, intravenous corticosteroid and/or paracetamol, and generally during or within 1 hour after the infusion is completed. The first infusion reaction usually occurs after the 2 nd to 4 th infusion. The most common signs and symptoms of local infusion reactions are: erythema, pruritus, and rash. The most common signs and symptoms of systemic infusion reactions are: urticaria, dyspnoea, flushing, hyperhidrosis, chest discomfort or pain, chills, and hypertension. Anaphylaxis (characterized by stridor, wheezing, peri-oral/lingual oedema, or hemodynamic instability, with or without rash or urticaria) occurred in 14 (5.1%) of 273 total patients treated with KRYSTEXXA in clinical studies. One patient treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 4 weeks experienced a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction. In clinical trials, 91% of patients who experienced an infusion-related reaction had a serum uric acid level above 6 mg/dl (360 μmol/L) due to the development of anti-pegloticase antibodies. Infusion-related reactions showed a tendency to occur in a greater proportion of patients with over 100 kg bodyweight. They were reported in 54% of the patients in the 70 to ≤100 kg weight group, 70% of the patients in the &gt;100 to ≤120 kg weight group, and 75% of patients in the &gt;120 kg weight group, respectively. Many infusion-related reactions resolved with slowing, or stopping the infusion, before restarting the infusion at a slower rate. Others resolved with supportive treatment with i.v. fluids, additional glucocorticoids or antihistamines, or following discontinuation of the infusion and with epinephrine for anaphylactic reactions.

In the post-marketing setting, severe anaphylactic reactions have been reported, including loss of consciousness, circulatory collapse, and cardiac arrest, which required transfer to hospital emergency department.

## Gout flares

The frequency of gout flares may increase after initiation of treatment with KRYSTEXXA, despite gout prophylaxis with colchicine or NSAIDs, but the frequency and severity of gout flares diminishes after 3 months of KRYSTEXXA therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In clinical trials, the percentage of patients that had flares in the first 3 months was 75% in patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks compared with 54% in placebo-treated patients. This compared with flare rates of 41%and 67% in the same groups in the subsequent 3 months, and gout flares were infrequent in patients that received pegloticase 8 mg every 2 weeks for over one year.

## Immunogenicity

In clinical trials, anti-pegloticase antibodies (IgM and IgG) developed in 89% of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks and 15% in the placebo group. Anti-PEG antibodies also developed in 41% of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks.

High anti-pegloticase antibody titres were associated with a failure to maintain normalisation of uric acid (&lt;6 mg/dl). There was also a higher incidence of infusion reactions in patients with high anti-pegloticase antibody titres: 46% (18 of 39) in the KRYSTEXXA every 2 weeks group compared to 9% (4 of 46) in patients with low or no antibody titres. 4.9 Overdose No case of overdose with KRYSTEXXA has been reported during clinical development. The maximum dose that has been administered as a single intravenous dose during clinical studies was 12 mg. A post-marketing report documented administration of the contents of 2 vials (16 mg) without any adverse reaction related to KRYSTEXXA administration. It is recommended that patients suspected of receiving an overdose be monitored, and general supportive measures be initiated as no specific antidote has been identified. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-gout preparations, other anti-gout preparations, ATC code: M04AX02 Pegloticase is a uricase enzyme conjugated with mPEG at an average degree of substitution of 40.8 moles of mPEG/mole of protein (10.2 moles of mPEG/monomeric sub-unit of the mature homotetrameric uricase protein). The average molecular mass of pegloticase is approximately 545 kDa of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 137 kDa. Mechanism of action Pegloticase catalyses the conversion of uric acid into the inert highly water-soluble metabolite allantoin, with hydrogen peroxide and carbon dioxide as oxidative by-products. Allantoin is eliminated by renal excretion, thereby lowering serum uric acid. This induces a concentration gradient between serum uric acid and tissue/joints deposits of monosodium urate resulting in the migration of urate from tissues/joints, which makes it accessible to conversion to allantoin.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

In clinical trials, the mean plasma uric acid (PUA) levels fell to 0.7 mg/dl approximately 24 hours following the first dose of pegloticase in patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks compared with a mean PUA of 8.2 mg/dl in the placebo-treated patients.

Plasma uric acid decreased with increasing pegloticase dose or concentration. Sustained decrease in plasma uric acid below the solubility concentration of 6 mg/dl was observed for more than 12 days with single doses of 8 mg and 12 mg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The efficacy and safety of KRYSTEXXA was assessed in two replicate Phase III pivotal trials (GOUT 1 and GOUT 2) that were conducted in 212 adult patients with chronic gout refractory to allopurinol.

Patients were randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive 8 mg every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks or placebo for 6 months. The mean PUA at baseline was 9.8 mg/dl. Seventy-one percent (71%) of patients had baseline tophi. The average number of gout flares per patient was 10 during the 18 months prior to study entry.

The primary endpoint in both trials was the proportion of responder patients that achieved plasma uric acid (PUA) less than 0.36 mmol/L (6 mg/dl) for at least 80% of the time during Month 3 and Month 6.

As shown in Table 2, a greater proportion of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks were responders as compared to patients receiving placebo. Responders maintained PUA values &lt; 6 mg/dl throughout the 6-month treatment period. Although the 4-week regimen also demonstrated efficacy for the primary endpoint, this regimen was associated with increased frequency of infusion reactions. Table 2.

The HAQ-PGA scores were 42.4 at baseline vs. 27.1 at Week 25 in patients treated with pegloticase 8 mg every 2 weeks compared to 51.6 vs. 53.4 in the placebo group (p ≤ 0.001).

The HAQ-DI scores were 1.1 at baseline vs. 0.84 at Week 25 in patients treated with pegloticase 8 mg every 2 weeks compared to 1.2 vs. 1.3 in the placebo group (p ≤ 0.01). The Pain scores using a visual analogue scale were 44.2 at baseline vs. 28.4 at Week 25 in patients treated with pegloticase 8 mg every 2 weeks compared to 53.9 vs. 57.2 in the placebo group (p ≤ 0.001).

Among the other secondary endpoints, reduction from baseline in the number of tender and swollen joints were observed in patients treated with KRYSTEXXA every 2 weeks while there was little change in patients on placebo.

## Special populations

Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with KRYSTEXXA in one or more subset of the paediatric population in the treatment and/or prevention of hyperuricaemia related to Tumour Lysis Syndrome (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties KRYSTEXXA was administered by intravenous infusion with a Tmax of 2.25 h (range: 1.92 - 4.25 h for initial dose). There was potential for some accumulation with the KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every two weeks dosing regimen due to the long half-life of pegloticase (214 h; range: 123 - 444 h for terminal half-life). The mean Cmax calculated on the last infusion was 2.17 µg/ml (range: 1.25 - 4.77). The mean area under the KRYSTEXXA plasma concentration versus time curve at steady-state (AUC0-t) was 445 h*µg/ml (range: 223 - 1040 h*µg/ml). From the nonclinical studies, the elimination of pegloticase is via renal/urinary excretion. For the PEG moiety, urinary excretion is likely to be the major route of elimination. The population PK analyses showed that age, sex and weight did not influence the pharmacokinetics of pegloticase. Anti-pegloticase antibodies were associated with an increase in CL and Vc as determined by compartmental analysis. Clearance was 0.0145 L/h with a range of 0.00904 - 0.0229 for no increase in anti-pegloticase antibodies and 0.0193 L/h with a range of 0.00675 - 0.0340 for an increase in anti-pegloticase antibodies. The volume of distribution was 4.45 L with a range of 2.62 5.89 for no increase in anti-pegloticase antibodies and 5.77 L with a range of 2.77 - 10.6 for an increase in anti-pegloticase antibodies. The Phase 1 pharmacokinetics showed proportionality within the dose interval (0.5 - 8 mg) as reflected in Cmax values. However, due to variability in the AUC values, AUC proportionality was not seen which might be a reflection of antibody clearance for some of the subjects. The PK/PD analysis showed that higher doses were associated with lower uric acid levels and a more rapid decrease in these levels than lower doses. Antibodies to pegloticase associated with clearance of pegloticase resulted in a small stimulation in the elimination of urate. Those subjects that did not have anti- pegloticase antibodies that cleared pegloticase  had a significant effect on the stimulation in the elimination of urate. Neither body weight nor baseline creatinine clearance had a significant effect on the PD response. Medicinal product no longer authorised

No formal studies were conducted to examine the effects of renal insufficiency on pegloticase pharmacokinetics. A total of 32% (27 of 85) of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks had a creatinine clearance of ≤62.5 ml/min.

No formal studies were conducted to examine the effects of hepatic impairment.

In the clinical studies, 34% (29 of 85) of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks were 65 years of age and older and 12% (10 of 85) were 75 years of age and older. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older and younger patients, but greater

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No dose adjustment is needed for patients 65 years of age and older.

The pharmacokinetics of KRYSTEXXA has not been studied in children and adolescents.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

In repeated dose toxicity studies with KRYSTEXXA in rats and dogs, the occurrence of pegloticase-containing vacuoles was observed in different tissues. The degree of vacuolization and the number of tissues affected appeared to be dependent both on the applied pegloticase dose and the duration of exposure. The potential clinical relevance of these findings is currently unknown; however no adverse effects were associated with the presence of vacuoles.

Non-clinical studies to evaluate the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential have not been performed. In the pregnant rat study there was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity at 46 times the clinical exposure (AUC). There were no effects on the fertility of male or female rats.  Prenatal and postnatal development study in rats, as well as the embryofetal development study in rabbits are ongoing. 6.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Talk to your doctor or nurse before using KRYSTEXXA:

-If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. What is in this leaflet 1. What KRYSTEXXA is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you receive KRYSTEXXA 3. How to use KRYSTEXXA 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store KRYSTEXXA 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What KRYSTEXXA is and what it is used for KRYSTEXXA contains the active substance pegloticase. Pegloticase belongs to the class anti-gout medicines. Pegloticase is used to treat severe long-term gout in adult patients who also have one or more painful deposits of uric acid crystals under the skin that cause difficulty in carrying out daily activities and who do not respond or cannot take other anti-gout medicines. How KRYSTEXXA works People with gout have too much uric acid in their body. Uric acid deposits as crystals in joints, kidneys, and other organs which may cause profound pain, redness and swelling (inflammation). KRYSTEXXA contains an enzyme called uricase that transforms the uric acid into a substance called allantoin, which can be removed easily in the urine. 2. What you need to know before you receive KRYSTEXXA Do not use KRYSTEXXA · If you are allergic to pegloticase, or other uricases or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). · If you have a rare blood problem called glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency or favism. Your doctor may test you for G6PD before you start KRYSTEXXA. Warnings and precautions Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -if you are currently taking other medicines to lower your uric acid level
- -if you have been told you have heart failure
- -if you have ever been told you have an enzyme deficiency that causes anaemia
- -if you weigh over 100 kg
- -if you have been treated with KRYSTEXXA before

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Monitoring during treatment

Your doctor will test your blood to measure uric acid levels before each dose to make sure that you should continue receiving KRYSTEXXA.

## Children and adolescents

KRYSTEXXA has not been studied in children or adolescents under 18 years of age. Therefore, this medicine is not recommended in this age group.

## Other medicines and KRYSTEXXA

Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is especially important to tell your doctor if you are currently taking other urate-lowering medicines (such as allopurinol or Febuxostat) or medicines containing polyethylene glycol (PEG) (such as pegylated interferon or Doxorubicin). These medicines may put you at higher risk of infusion reaction.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine . Do not use KRYSTEXXA if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, since it is not known how it will affect you or your baby. Driving and using machines KRYSTEXXA has little or no effect on your ability to drive. If you do not feel well, experience symptoms such as dizziness or headache, or are tired after receiving KRYSTEXXA, you should not drive or operate any machines. KRYSTEXXA contains sodium KRYSTEXXA contains 4.2 mg sodium per dose which means it is essentially sodium free. 3. How to use KRYSTEXXA KRYSTEXXA should be given to you by a doctor or nurse experienced in the treatment of severe chronic gout in a healthcare centre. How much KRYSTEXXA is given The recommended dose of KRYSTEXXA is 8 mg. This dose is not adjusted for weight, age or kidney disease. Before you start treatment with KRYSTEXXA, your doctor may recommend that you take other medicines (such as an antihistamine, paracetamol and a corticosteroid) to help reduce the risk that you will get infusion-related reactions due to this treatment. Take these medicines as directed by your doctor. How KRYSTEXXA is administered KRYSTEXXA is injected slowly into a vein (i.v. infusion) and your treatment will take about 2 hours or sometimes longer. If you have a reaction during the infusion, your doctor may stop or adjust the treatment. Your doctor may also ask you to wait after your treatment to be sure that you do not have an infusion-related reaction. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## You will receive KRYSTEXXA every 2 weeks.

If you stop taking KRYSTEXXA, and then are treated again, you may be at increased risk of infusion reactions, including severe acute allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) so your doctor will monitor you carefully when you restart treatment.

Your doctor will also test your blood to measure uric acid before your next dose to make sure that you should continue receiving KRYSTEXXA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most commonly reported serious side effects are: severe acute allergic reactions ( common ), infusion reactions ( very common ), and gout flares ( very common ).

KRYSTEXXA will be administered by a doctor or nurse who will monitor you for side effects while you receive KRYSTEXXA and for some time afterwards.

If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet.

Severe allergic reactions ( common ) include fainting, sudden drop in blood pressure, and cardiac arrest. Allergic reactions usually happen within 2 hours of the infusion, but may also happen at a later time. If you suddenly notice: · a swelling of the throat, tongue or other part of your body · tightness of the throat, hoarse voice or trouble swallowing · a shortness of breath, wheezing or breathing problems · a rash, itching or hives tell your doctor or nurse IMMEDIATELY, since any of these may be signs of a serious allergic reaction. The most common signs and symptoms of local infusion reactions were: redness at the injection site, itching, and rash. The most common signs and symptoms of generalised infusion reactions were: hives, shortness of breath, redness in the face, sweating, chest discomfort or pain, chills, and high blood pressure. Allergic reactions may be more likely to occur in patients who weigh more than 100 kg. An increase in gout flares is frequently observed when starting KRYSTEXXA. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce the likelihood of gout flares after starting KRYSTEXXA. KRYSTEXXA does not need to be discontinued because of a gout flare. Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): hives, skin rash, itchy, dry or irritated skin, nausea Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): high blood sugar levels, vomiting, joint swelling, flu-like symptoms Uncommon side effects: (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): worsening of a type of heart disease called congestive heart failure, skin infection, elevated potassium levels in the blood Frequency not known (cannot be estimated from available data): destruction of red blood cells Medicinal product no longer authorised

Annex IV Scientific conclusions and grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for pegloticase, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

## Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations

Reports of infusion related reactions or anaphylaxis coincident with concomitant use of oral urate lowering agents were submitted in this Periodic Safety Update Report, where infusion reactions in 28 cases and 9 cases with anaphylactic reactions were reported. As the development of these adverse events may have been prevented in at least some of these cases if the patients would not have been treated with concomitant urate lowering substances, an amendment of the summary of product characteristics focusing on the importance of stopping treatment with uric acid lowering agents with regard to masking the results of serum uric acid values (and therefore increasing the risk for infusion reactions and anaphylactic reactions) should be implemented. The revised order of the two corresponding paragraphs is to emphasize the correlation between concomitant medication with urate lowering products and serum uric acid measurement. In addition, a further amendment regarding the extension of the time of observation following the end of infusion from 1 hour to 2 hours as a precautionary measure has been included along with a statement that delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported. Therefore, in view of available data regarding anaphylaxis and infusion reactions, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee considered that changes to the product information were warranted. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pegloticase the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing pegloticase is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.
