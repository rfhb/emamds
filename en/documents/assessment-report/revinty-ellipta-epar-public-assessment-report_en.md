## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## Problem statement

Asthma is a chronic pulmonary disease characterized by airway inflammation, bronchoconstriction and increased airway responsiveness [Global Initiative in Asthma (GINA) Guideline, 2011] affecting 1%18% of the population across different countries. The mortality, morbidity and costs associated with asthma  are  substantial. Inhaled  corticosteroids (ICS) are considered  the  most  effective anti-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

inflammatory treatments for all severities of persistent asthma [GINA Guideline, 2011], resulting in a control  of  asthma  symptoms,  improvement in  quality  of  life  and  lung  function  and  reduction  in  the frequency  and  severity  of  asthma  exacerbations.  Add-on  therapy  with  inhaled  LABA  is  preferred  to increasing the dose of ICS to achieve asthma control, and is associated with improvement in symptom scores, decreases in nocturnal asthma symptoms, improvement in lung function and reduction of the number  of  asthma  exacerbations.  Without  concomitant  ICS  inhaled  LABA  may  be  associated  with increased risk of serious asthma-related events (including hospitalisation, intubation and death), and therefore inhaled LABA therapy should not be used as monotherapy in asthma [GINA Guideline, 2011].

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common disease that accounts for 5% of deaths globally  [World  Health  Organisation  (WHO)  2012].  As  a  leading  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality worldwide,  COPD  produces  a  substantial,  and  growing,  economic  and  social  burden  [GOLD,  2011]. COPD  is  characterised  by  persistent,  usually  progressive,  airflow  limitation  associated  with  an enhanced  inflammatory  response  in  the  airways  and  the  lungs.  Exacerbations  and  comorbidities contribute  to  the  overall  severity  [Global  Initiative  for  Obstructive  Lung  Disease  (GOLD),  2011].  An exacerbation is an acute event characterised by a worsening of the symptoms of COPD that require treatment with oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics (moderate exacerbations) or that require an inpatient  hospitalization  (severe  exacerbations).  The  goals  of  pharmacologic  therapy  in  COPD  are  the reduction in symptoms and in the frequency and severity of exacerbations, and the improvement of health  status  and  exercise  tolerance  [GOLD,  2011].  Bronchodilators,  such  as  long-acting  beta2 agonists (LABA), are key to improving lung function and managing symptoms in COPD. In patients not adequately controlled with a LABA, the addition of a ICS usually leads to reductions in the frequency of exacerbations,  improves  symptoms  and  quality  of  life  and  produces  small  improvements  in  lung function [GOLD, 2011].

## About the product

Revinty Ellipta Ellipta 92 µg/22 µg &amp; 184 µg/22 µg inhalation powder is a pre-dispensed multi dose dry powder for oral inhalation. The active ingredients are fluticasone furoate (FF) and Vilanterol (VI) (as trifenatate). FF is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory activity, while VI is a selective long-acting, beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA).

The novel dry powder inhaler (NDPI), called Ellipta, incorporates two blister strips, one containing a blend of micronised FF and lactose monohydrate and the other containing a blend of micronised VI, lactose monohydrate and magnesium stearate. Upon actuation, the inhaler delivers the contents of one blister containing FF blend and one blister containing VI blend.

Revinty  Ellipta  is  a  novel  ICS/LABA  fixed  dose  combination  for  oral  inhalation  administered  from  a Novel  Dry  Powder  Inhaler  (NDPI).  It  contains  fluticasone  furoate  (FF;  GW685698X),  an  ICS,  and vilanterol  (VI;  vilanterol  trifenatate;  GW642444M),  an  inhaled  LABA.  Neither  FF  nor  VI  is  currently available as an individual component for oral inhalation However, FF is the active substance in Avamys, an intranasal corticosteroid authorised via the Centralised Procedure.

The Applicant applied for the following two indications:

## Asthma

Revinty Ellipta is indicated for the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and  older  where  use  of  a  combination  medicinal  product  (long-acting  beta2-agonist  and  inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate:

- patients  not  adequately  controlled  with inhaled  corticosteroids  and  'as  needed'  inhaled  short acting beta2-agonists.

## COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Revinty  Ellipta  is  indicated  for  the  symptomatic  treatment  of  adults  with  COPD  with  a  FEV1&lt;70% predicted  normal  (post-bronchodilator)  with  an  exacerbation  history  despite  regular  bronchodilator therapy.

In asthma, the posology requested is one inhalation of Revinty Ellipta 92 μg/22 μg once daily (OD). If patients are inadequately controlled on Revinty Ellipta 92 mcg/22 μg OD, the dose of Revinty Ellipta 184 μg/22 μg should be considered.

In COPD, the posology requested is one inhalation of Revinty Ellipta 92 mcg/22 μg OD. Revinty Ellipta 184 μg/22 mcg is not recommended in COPD, due to lack of superior efficacy compared to the lower dose, and increase in risk of pneumonia and other adverse events.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

Since  this  application  is  an  informed  consent  of  the  Relvar  Ellipta  application,  the  quality  data  in support  of  the  Revinty  Ellipta  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  quality  data  of  the  Relvar Ellipta dossier, which has been assessed and approved.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

No non-clinical  data  have  been  submitted  in  the  Revinty  Ellipta  dossier,  since  this  application  is  an informed consent of the Relvar Ellipta application: the non-clinical data in support of the Revinty Ellipta application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Relvar Ellipta dossier, which have been assessed and approved.

## 2.3.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An  environmental  Risk  Assessment(ERA)  has  been  provided,  which  is  identical  to  the  one  that  was submitted for Relvar Ellipta.

The  ERA  was  prepared  in  compliance  with  the  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). The two active substances fluticasone furoate  and  vilanterol  have  been  assessed  separately.  Predicted  environmental  concentrations  were significantly below the threshold value of 0.01 μL, indicating that no a Phase II - Tier A is needed for both active substances.

## Fluticasone furoate (GW685698)

A Phase I environmental risk assessment was performed to evaluate potential environmental risks of fluticasone furoate. The log Kow was determined according to study OECD 117 with a value of 2.61. Based on the log Kow value being below 3, fluticasone furoate is not expected to be a bio-accumulative substance. The environmental exposure assessment was estimated according to the formula for the calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC):

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The following values were used for the calculation:

```
DOSE ai = 0.200 (mg patient -1 d -1 ) F pen =   0.01 (patient inh -1 ) WASTEW inhab = 200 (L inh -1 d -1 )
```

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## DILUTION = 10 (-)

PECsurfacewater is 0.001 µg/L.

The PECsurfacewater is below 0.01 μg/L, and thus a phase II assessment is not necessary.

Fluticasone  furoate  is  a  glucocorticoid,  hence  it  should  be  considered  as  a  potential  endocrine disruptor. Therefore the potential endocrine activity of this compound should be investigated. In the context of the obligation of the Applicant to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommends the following point to be addressed:

- An OECD 210 modified extended early life-stage study in fish using fluticasone furoate should be conducted to complete the Environmental Risk Assessment. Once the results are available, the Environmental Risk Assessment should be updated accordingly.

The  results  from  this  additional  study  were  not  considered  required  by  the  Committee  before  the adoption of the positive CHMP opinion and it is confirmed that these applications comply with Article 6 of Regulation 726/2004 having regard to the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83.

## Vilanterol (GW64244)

A Phase I environmental risk assessment was performed to evaluate potential environmental risks of vilanterol. The log Kow was determined according to study OECD 107 with a value of 1.354. Based on the  log  Kow value  being  below  3,  vilanterol  is  not  expected  to  be  a  bio-accumulative  substance.The environmental exposure assessment was estimated according to the formula for the calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC):

DILUTION WASTEW ⋅ inhab The following values were used for the calculation: DOSE ai = 0.025 (mg patient -1 d -1 ) F pen =   0.01 (patient inh -1 ) WASTEW inhab = 200 (L inh -1 d -1 ) DILUTION = 10 (-) PECsurfacewater is 0.00013 µg/L.

$$F DOSE PEC ⋅ = pen SURFACE WATER ai$$

The PECsurfacewater is below 0.01 μg/L, and thus a phase II assessment is not necessary.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

No  new  clinical  data  has  been  provided  within  this  application.  The  clinical  data  in  support  of  the Revinty Ellipta application is identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Relvar Ellipta dossier which have already been assessed and approved by the CHMP.

## 2.5. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## 2.6. Risk Management Plan

RMP  version  6.2  was  provided  with  this  submission.  This  RMP  version  6.2  is  identical  to  the  RMP approved  for  Relvar  Ellipta,  no  further  assessment  was  needed  and  therefore  no  PRAC  Advice  was sought.

Below is  a  short  overview  of  the  content  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan  which  is  identical  to  Relvar Ellipta:

| Pneumonia in patients with COPD and Asthma | Section 4.4 Warnings and Precautions: Pneumonia in patients with COPD An increase in pneumonia has been observed in patients with COPD receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol. There was also an increased incidence of pneumonias resulting in hospitalisation. In some incidences these pneumonia events were fatal (see section 4.8). Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of such infections overlap with the symptoms of COPD exacerbations.

There is no additional benefit of the 184/22 micrograms dose compared to the 92/22 micrograms dose and there is a potential increased risk of systemic corticosteroid-related adverse reactions (see section 4.8). The incidence of pneumonia in patients with asthma was common at the higher dose. The incidence of pneumonia in patients with asthma taking fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 184/22 micrograms was numerically higher compared with those receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms or placebo (see section 4.8).

For severe pneumonia the corresponding number of events per 1000 patient years were 33.6, 35.5, and 7.6 respectively, while for serious pneumonia the corresponding events per 1000 patient/years were 35.1 for FF/VI 184/22, 42.9 with FF/VI 92/22, 12.1 with VI 22. Finally, the exposure-adjusted cases of fatal pneumonia were 8.8 for FF/VI 184/22 versus 1.5 for FF/VI 92/22 and 0 for VI 22. In an integrated analysis of 7 studies in COPD (n = 4236), the number of pneumonia events per 1000 patient years was 92.3 with FF/VI 184/22, 77.7 in the FF/VI 92/22, 42.2 in the VI 22 group and 18.0 with placebo.

| Off Label Use in children <12 years of Age | The indication in asthma is in Adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over For Children aged under 12 years: The safety and efficacy of Relvar Ellipta in children under 12 years of age has not yet been established in the Indication for Asthma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Not applicable             |                |

The CHMP confirmed that no changes are needed for this Risk Management Plan of Revinty Ellipta.

## 2.7. User consultation

A justification  for  not  performing  a  full  user  consultation  with  target  patient  groups  on  the  package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

The Applicant provided the report on the results from the user consultation done for Relvar Ellipta. The CHMP considered it acceptable to refer to the user consultation done for Relvar Ellipta as the package leaflet  is  identical  and  no  separate  user  testing  for  this  informed  consent  application  is  considered necessary.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

The  application  has  been  submitted  in  accordance  with  Article  10c  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  as amended (Informed consent Application) under automatic access to the centralised procedure.

Revinty Ellipta is identical to Relvar Ellipta previously approved by the CHMP. The quality, non-clinical, efficacy  and  safety  data  for  Revinty  Ellipta  is  therefore  considered  satisfactorily  and  the  benefit-risk profile for Revinty Ellipta is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority decision that the risk-benefit balance of Revinty Ellipta in:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, where use of a combination product (long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate: patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting beta2-agonists).
- the symptomatic treatment of patients with COPD with a FEV1 &lt;70% predicted normal (postbronchodilator) in patients with an exacerbation history despite regular bronchodilator therapy.

is  favourable  and  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  subject  to  the following conditions:

## Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation

## · Periodic safety update reports

The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines webportal.

## Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

## · Risk Management Plan (RMP)

The  MAH  shall  perform  the  required  Pharmacovigilance  activities  and  interventions  detailed  in  the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP.

An updated RMP should be submitted:

- At the request of the European Medicines Agency;
- Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important (Pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

If the submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the same time.

## · Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures

The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures:

| Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Due date          |

Not applicable.

## Paediatric Data

Furthermore,  the  CHMP  reviewed  the  available  paediatric  data  of  studies  subject  to  the  agreed Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  P/0216/2013  and  the  results  of  these  studies  are  reflected  in  the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Divergent Position

The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP's opinion recommending the granting of a Marketing Authorisation for Revinty Ellipta for the following indications:

## Asthma Indication:

Revinty Ellipta is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, where use of a combination product (long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate:

- patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting beta2-agonists.

## COPD Indication:

Revinty  Ellipta  is  indicated  for  symptomatic  treatment  of  adults  with  COPD  with  a  FEV1  &lt;70% predicted  normal  (post-bronchodilator)  with  an  exacerbation  history  despite  regular  bronchodilator therapy.

The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows:

In  asthma,  the  superiority  of  the  fixed  dose  combination  (FDC)  to  the  mono  components  on bronchodilatory effect and symptomatic improvement  has not been sufficiently demonstrated (Guideline on Fixed Combination Medicinal Products (CPMP/EWP/240/95 Rev. 1)). None of the mono components have been previously approved for the treatment of asthma, and non-inferiority of the FDC  compared  with  established  LABA/ICS  FDC  therapies,  or  superiority  of  the  FDC  compared  with established LABA or ICS mono therapies in asthma has not been proven.

Regarding the COPD indication, no clear symptomatic benefit of the FDC versus placebo was apparent on  dyspnoea  scores,  and  the  chosen  active  comparator  (VI)  for  the  exacerbation  studies  is  not considered optimal as it is not an authorised LABA for the treatment of patients with COPD. Therefore, the magnitude of the symptomatic effect (dyspnoea, exacerbations) of the FDC in COPD is uncertain. The issue is hampered by the lack of comparisons with established COPD therapies.

In relation to safety issues, the risk of pneumonia seems to be a common and serious adverse event, with 6 fatal cases of pneumonia observed in the COPD studies, which are of special concern. This risk cannot be fully characterized due to methodological limitations of the clinical studies with regard to the assessment of pneumonia.
