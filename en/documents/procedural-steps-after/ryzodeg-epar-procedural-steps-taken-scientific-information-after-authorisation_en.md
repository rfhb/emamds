Update of sections 4.2 and section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update the information on dosing and administration interval of Ryzodeg (insulin aspart/insulin degludec) based on data from 2 trials: • NN5401-4266, a 38 week trial comparing effect and safety of insulin degludec/insulin aspart vs. insulin glargine plus insulin aspart in subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin with or without oral antidiabetic treatment in need of treatment intensification. • NN5401-3996, a 26-week trial comparing efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/insulin aspart BID and insulin degludec OD plus insulin aspart in subjects with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus treated with basal insulin in need of treatment intensification with mealtime insulin. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make editorial changes in the SmPC. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance | 28/03/2019   | 03/05/2019 | SmPC | Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: Ryzodeg can be administered once or twice daily with the main meal(s) alone, in combination with oral antidiabetic medicinal products, and in combination with bolus insulin. When using Ryzodeg once-daily, changing to twice daily should be considered when higher doses are needed, e.g. to avoid hypoglycaemia. Split the dose based on individual patient's needs and administer with main meals. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus: Ryzodeg can be administered once daily at mealtime in combination with short-/rapid-acting insulin at the remaining meals. Section 5.1 of the SmPC was updated to reflect the additional data provided (please refer to the product information for the detailed results). |
