## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for latanoprost / netarsudil, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data from the literature and spontaneous reports, including in some cases a close temporal relationship and a positive de-challenge, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between latanoprost / netarsudil and reticular epithelial corneal oedema is at least a reasonable possibility. Therefore, the PRAC concluded that the Product Information (PI) of products containing latanoprost / netarsudil should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for latanoprost / netarsudil the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing latanoprost / netarsudil is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
