<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ENGERIX-B®, and MMR ) in healthy infants and toddlers aged 2 to 12 months in the Russian Federation.

MET33 was conducted at 11 centres that enrolled participants in The Russian Federation (8 centres) and The United Mexican States (Mexico) (3 centres).

MET33 that was conducted between 17 October 2018 (first subject first visit) and 18 February 2022 (last subject last visit).

## Methods

## Study participants

A total of 525 subjects were planned to be enrolled. Approximately 300 healthy, meningococcal vaccine naïve infants aged 2 months were randomised in a 2:1 ratio in Mexico, and 225 healthy, meningococcal-vaccine naïve infants aged 2 months were randomised in a 2:1 ratio in the Russian Federation.

Informed consent form has been signed and dated by the parent(s) or guardian(s), as required by local regulations.

The study population included healthy infants born after a full-term pregnancy, 60 to 89 days of age on the day of the first study visit.

Subjects were excluded from study enrolment if they participated in another clinical trial up to 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination; if they received any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination (except for influenza vaccination, which may be received at a gap of at least 2 weeks before or 2 weeks after any study vaccination); if previously vaccinated against meningococcal disease, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, poliovirus, rotavirus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, measles, mumps, rubella, and / or varicella (for Mexico: More than 1 previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine); if they had a history of infection with Neisseria meningitidis or diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, hepatitis A, measles, mumps, rubella, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and /or rotavirus infection/disease; if they received immune globulins, blood or blood-derived products since birth; if they have known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency or received immunosuppressive therapy; if they had blood dyscrasias, leukaemia, lymphoma of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic systems or active tuberculosis; if they had a history of any neurologic disorder (seizures, progressive neurologic disorders, Guillain-Barré syndrome); if they had a known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components or to latex, or history of a life-threatening reaction to the vaccine(s) used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances; if the subject reported thrombocytopenia contraindicating IM vaccination in the Investigator's; if they had a bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating IM vaccination in the Investigator's opinion; if they received oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 72 hours of the first blood draw.

## Observational Endpoints

## Safety Endpoints

-  Occurrence, nature (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] preferred term), duration, intensity, relationship to vaccination, and whether the event led to early termination from the study, of any unsolicited systemic AEs reported in the 30 minutes after each vaccination;
-  Occurrence, time of onset, number of days of occurrence, intensity, action taken, and whether the reaction led to early termination from the study, of solicited (prelisted in the subject's diary card and CRF) injection site reactions occurring up to D07 after each vaccination;
-  Occurrence, time of onset, number of days of occurrence, intensity, action taken, and whether the reaction led to early termination from the study, of solicited (prelisted in the subject's diary card and CRF) systemic reactions occurring up to D07 after each vaccination;
-  Occurrence, nature (MedDRA preferred term), time of onset, duration, intensity, action taken, relationship to vaccination, and whether the event led to early termination from the study, of unsolicited AEs up to D30 after each vaccination;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Occurrence, nature (MedDRA preferred term), time of onset, duration, seriousness criteria, relationship to vaccination, outcome, and whether the event led to early termination from the study, of SAEs (including AESIs) throughout the trial from D0 to the last study visit.

## Collection of Safety Data

All subjects were followed for safety from Visit 1 to the last study visit.

-  All subjects were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination under the supervision of a responsible healthcare professional at each study site and any unsolicited systemic AEs occurring during that time were recorded as immediate unsolicited systemic AEs in the electronic case report form (eCRF).
-  The subject's parent / guardian recorded information in a diary card about solicited injectionsite reactions and solicited systemic reactions from D0 to D7 after each vaccination and unsolicited AEs were recorded from D0 after each vaccination until the subject returns for the next study visit.
-  Serious AEs (including AEs of special interest [AESIs]) were recorded in a diary card throughout the study. The subject's parent / guardian was asked to notify the site immediately about any potential SAEs at any time during the trial.
-  A member of the study staff contacted subject's parent / guardian by telephone 8 days (+2 days) after each vaccination visit to identify the occurrence of any SAE (including AESIs) that had not yet been reported and reminded him/her to complete the diary card after each vaccination visit, and to bring it back to the next study visit.
-  The completed diary cards were collected and reviewed with the subject's parent / guardian at subsequent visits.

A member of the study staff contacted the subject's parent / guardian by telephone 14 days (+2 days) before the first study visit of the subject's second year of life to identify the occurrence of any SAE that had not yet been reported and reminded him/her to complete the diary card and to next study visit so it could be reviewed at the study site.

## Sample size

The sample size of this study was chosen to provide immunogenicity and safety data; it is not intended for the purposes of hypothesis testing. No formal sample size calculation was performed.

Though there are no statistically powered hypotheses, the overall study cohort (n=525) will provide a probability of approximately 95% of observing any AE with a true incidence of 0.57%. The overall MenACYW conjugate vaccine cohort (n=350) will provide a probability of approximately 95% of observing any AE with a true incidence of 0.85%. In treatment arm with n=200, there is a probability of approximately 95% of observing any AE with a true incidence of 1.5%. In treatment arm with n=150, there is a probability of approximately 95% of observing any AE with a true incidence of 2%.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

## Randomisation

On the day of enrollment, subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and whose parent / guardian signs the ICF will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio in Mexico, and in a 2:1 ratio in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Russian Federation such that Group 1 will have 200 subjects, Group 2 will have 100 subjects, Group 3 will have 150 subjects, and Group 4 will have 75 subjects.

Site staff will connect to the IRT system, enter the identification and security information, and confirm a minimal amount of data in response to IRT-system prompts. The IRT system will then provide the vaccine assignment and subject number. The full detailed procedures for Group allocation are described in the Operating Guidelines. If a subject who has enrolled is not eligible to participate in the study, then the subject's information will only be recorded on the subjectrecruitment log.

Subject numbers that are assigned by the IRT system will consist of a 12-digit string (a 3-digit country identifier, a 4-digit study centre identifier, and a 5-digit subject identifier). For example, Subject 840000100005 is the fifth subject enrolled in Centre Number 1 in the US (840 being the US country code).

Subject numbers should not be reassigned for any reason. The randomisation codes will be kept securely in the IRT system.

## Blinding

This trial is open-label; therefore, there is no need for code-breaking procedures. Until database lock and to prevent biases, the laboratory personnel performing the serology testing will be blinded to the group assignment. The laboratory will have a written procedure detailing how the blinding will be maintained.

Changes Following Study Unblinding/Database Lock and Post hoc Analyses:

A post-hoc sensitivity analysis was conducted on the immunogenicity data from Group 3 subjects at 30 days after the last MenACYW conjugate vaccine administration [post-dose 3 at 12 months of age] timepoint. This was due to the identification of unusual immunogenicity results at one of the Group 3 sites in the Russian Federation after conducting the hSBA analysis on the PPAS and FAS. The immune response to Meningococcal A, C, W, and Y serogroups in terms of percentage of subjects with seroprotective antibody titers and GMTs measured by hSBA at site no. 6431007 were more than 10fold lower compared to the results at other sites in the Russian Federation and in Mexico.

Therefore, immunogenicity results at this site 30 days after last vaccination were excluded in the posthoc analysis to assess its impact.

## Statistical Methods

Data were summarized descriptively. No hypotheses were tested.

## Sensitivity Post hoc Analysis

A post-hoc sensitivity analysis was conducted on the immunogenicity data from Group 3 subjects at 30 days after the last MenACYW conjugate vaccine administration [post-dose 3 at 12 months of age] timepoint. This was due to the identification of unusual immunogenicity results at one of the Group 3 sites in the Russian Federation after conducting the hSBA analysis on the PPAS and FAS. The immune response to Meningococcal A, C, W, and Y serogroups in terms of percentage of subjects with seroprotective antibody titers and GMTs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

measured by hSBA at site no. 6431007 were more than 10-fold lower compared to the results at other sites in the Russian Federation and in Mexico.

The table below presents the number and percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 1:8 (without Russian Federation site 6431007) 30 days after the last vaccination in the second year of life for subjects in PPAS2.

## Distribution of hSBA Titers and Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves of Meningococcal Antibody Titers

Distribution of hSBA Titers and RCDCs at D0 and D30 after the last vaccination of the infant series Mexico

An immune response against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W was observed at D30 after the last vaccination in the infant series. At D30, the antibody titers of Group 1 were shifted to the right compared to Group 2 for all serogroups indicating a stronger immune response with MenACYW conjugate vaccine than with Menveo vaccine.

## 2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects

MET33 was a phase III, open-label, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled, multi-centre study planned to descriptively compare the immunogenicity and safety of a 3-dose immunisation schedule of MenACYW (Group1: MenACYW + paediatric vaccines) and a 4-dose immunisation schedule of the comparator meningococcal conjugate vaccine Menveo (Group2: Menveo + paediatric vaccines) when administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines (Prevnar 13, Hexacima, RotaTeq, and MM-RII) in healthy infants and toddlers aged 2 to 12 months in Mexico, and to describe the immunogenicity and safety of a 3-dose immunisation schedule of MenACYW conjugate vaccine when administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines (Group3: MenACYW + paediatric vaccines and Group4: paediatric vaccines only; Prevnar 13, Pentaxim, ENGERIX-B, and MMR) in healthy infants and toddlers aged 2 to 12 months in the Russian Federation. Hence, a control group for meningococcal vaccination in the Russian Federation is lacking. MenACYW was administered at 2, 6 and 12 months of age. Menveo was administered at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age. It is critically noted that no hypotheses testing was planned for the study and that the study followed an open label design, which might influence the reporting of safety events.

Menveo is currently approved in the EU only from the age of 2 years. At submission of the planned type II variation, the MAH should discuss the use of Menveo as comparator vaccine. Furthermore, at the time of variation submission the MAH should justify a possible extrapolation of the concomitant vaccines and schedules used to the European situation (available vaccines and recommended vaccination schedules in the EU).

A total of 300 subjects were enrolled and randomised in Mexico and 190 subjects were enrolled and randomised in the Russian Federation: 200 subjects were enrolled from Mexico and randomised to Group 1, 100 subjects were enrolled from Mexico and randomised to Group 2, 150 subjects were enrolled from the Russian Federation and randomised to Group 3, and 75 subjects were enrolled from the Russian Federation and randomised to Group 4. The overall ratio of male/female subjects was 0.95 in Mexico and 0.92 in the Russian Federation which is acceptable. The mean age (±SD) of subjects enrolled in Mexico was 67.1 (±7.37) days [range: 60 to 90 days]; 72.8 (±8.57) days [range: 60 to 93 days] in the Russian Federation. Hence, the mean age of subjects was comparable between Mexico and the Russian Federation. Of note, the ethnical/geographical origin of subjects varied between the 2 countries. In Mexico (Groups 1 and 2), most of the subjects (81.3%) enrolled were American Indian or of Alaskan Native. The racial origin for the remaining 18.7% subjects was not reported. In the Russian Federation (Groups 3 and 4), all subjects enrolled were White. The possible impact of distinct HLA backgrounds of the native American (Mexico) and White (Russian Federation) individuals as well as the possible impact of geographic differences in serotype distribution on study outcomes should be discussed in the planned Variation.

## Immunogenicity

Immunogenicity data for meningococcal and routine pediatric vaccines were presented descriptively. The primary objectives were to describe the vaccine seroprotection to the antigens present in MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1) or Menveo (Group 2) when administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines in healthy infants and toddlers in Mexico and to describe the vaccine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

seroprotection following MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 3) when administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines in the Russian Federation. Primary endpoints were meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W antibody titres ≥ 1:8 measured by hSBA, assessed at 30 days after the last vaccination in the second year of life with MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1 and 3) or Menveo (Group 2).

In Mexico, the percentages of subjects with hSBA antibody titres ≥ 1:8 at D30 after the last dose were 97.6% for serogroup A, 99.2% for serogroup C, 100.0% for serogroups Y and W in Group 1 (MenACYW conjugate vaccine) and 95.0% for serogroup A, 93.3% for serogroup C, 100.0% for serogroups Y and W in Group 2 (Menveo vaccine). In the Russian Federation, the percentages of subjects with hSBA antibody titres ≥ 1:8 were 89.6% for serogroup A, 82.3% for serogroup C, 80.2% for serogroups Y and W in subjects who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 3).

Hence, the majority subjects showed seroprotection after MenACYW conjugate vaccine (in Mexico and the Russian Federation) or Menveo vaccine (in Mexico) in the second year of life with overall comparable responder rates between vaccines. According to MAH´s post hoc sensitivity analysis, the lower immunogenicity in the Russian Federation is mainly derived from study site no. 6431007. Reasons for the additional analysis with site exclusion were observed differences in seroprotection rates and GMTs with around 10-fold lower results compared to all other study sites. The analysis excluding the Russian Federation site no. 6431007 showed a higher percentage of subjects with hSBA titres ≥ 1:8, similar to the results observed in Group 1 in Mexico. The additional insight provided by this sensitivity analysis is acknowledged, but the exclusion of site no. 6431007 is not sufficiently justified to conclude on immunogenicity based on this sensitivity analysis.

Regarding the secondary objectives, at D30 after the last vaccination in the infant series at 6 months of age, the hSBA vaccine seroresponse (i.e. for a subject with a pre-vaccination titre &lt; 1:8, the postvaccination titre must be &gt;= 1:16; for a subject with a pre-vaccination titre &gt;= 1:8, the postvaccination titre must be at least 4-fold greater than the pre-vaccination titre) in Mexico was higher in subjects who received 2 doses of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1) than in subjects who received 3 doses of Menveo vaccine (Group 2) for serogroups A (84.7% vs 58.0%) and C (100.0% vs 86.4%) and was comparable for serogroups W (98.3% vs 97.5%) and Y (99.4% vs 92.6%) in both groups. In the Russian Federation (Group 3), the seroresponse after MenACYW conjugate vaccine was slightly lower (compared to Mexico) with 70.1% for serogroup A, 94.8% for serogroup C, 87.6% for serogroup Y, and 93.8% for serogroup W, reminiscent of results with the primary endpoint and hSBA GMTs.

At D30 after the last vaccination in the second year of life, the hSBA vaccine seroresponse in Mexico was overall comparable between subjects who received 2 doses of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1) and subjects who received 3 doses of Menveo vaccine (Group 2) for serogroups A (96.8% vs 85.0%), C (99.2% vs 88.3%), Y (100% vs 96.7%), and W (99.2% vs 100%). Hence, the seroresponse following the MenACYW vaccine overall increased slightly after vaccination in the second year of life compared to 6 months of age in Mexico. In the Russian Federation, the hSBA vaccine seroresponse was lower (A: 74.0%, C: 81.3%, Y: 80.2% and W: 79.2%) at D30 after the last vaccination in the second year of life compared to Mexico. Furthermore, the seroresponse in the Russian Federation was lower in the second year of life compared to 6 months of age which is somewhat unexpected.

In Mexico, hSBA GMTs for all 4 serogroups were higher than at baseline (D0) at D30 after the last vaccination of the infant series with either vaccine. The hSBA GMTs were higher in Group 1 (MenACYW conjugate vaccine; A: 71.7, C: 626, Y: 246 and W:340) compared to the Group 2 ( Menveo; A: 16.7, C: 62.4, Y: 59.8 and W: 95.7). Also, at D30 after the last vaccination in the second year of life, the hSBA GMTs for all serogroups in Group 1 were higher than in Group 2 (A: 145 vs 65.5, C: 897 vs 77, Y: 401 vs 228 and W: 639 vs 242). In the Russian Federation, the hSBA GMTs for all 4 serogroups

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were higher than at baseline at D30 after the last vaccination in the infant series. At D30 after the last vaccination in the second year of life, the hSBA GMTs were lower compared to results for group 1 and lower compared to group 2 for serogroups Y and W, but higher compared to group 2 for serogroups A and C (A: 85.4, C: 214, Y: 97.3 and W: 123). With respect to seroresponse and GMTs it is concluded that 3 vaccinations of MenQuadfi until 12 months of age appear to induce a stronger response in antibody titres compared to 4 vaccinations of Menveo in the same time frame and in a comparable population. The interpretation of responses in group 3 are compromised by the lack of a direct comparator but appear lower compared to the same age group in Mexico. It can be speculated whether genetic predisposition of study participants and/or geographic differences in serotype distribution across study sites could have an influence on study outcomes.

The immunogenicity profiles of the investigated routine paediatric vaccines ( Prevnar13, RotaTeq, Hexacima, MMR, Pentaxim, and ENGERIX-B ) were overall comparable when co-administered with a MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Menveo vaccine or when administered alone (after the infant series and in the second year of life) in Mexico and the Russian Federation. For instance, MMR vaccination response rates at D30 after vaccination in the second year of life for Groups 1 and 2 in Mexico were Measles: 99.2% vs 100%, Mumps: 100% vs 96.6% and Rubella: 100% vs 100%. In the Russian Federation (Groups 3 and 4), responder rates were Measles: 93.8% vs 88.0%, Mumps: 89.6% vs 90.0% and Rubella: 95.8% vs 94.0%.

According to the CSR, Prevnar13 was administered in all groups 1-4. However, no immunogenicity data on Prevnar13 from the Russian Federation (Groups 3 and 4) were found in the current CSR. If possible, these data should be provided with the planned Variation since the comparison: MenACYW + Prevnar13 vs Prevnar13 alone is considered of interest for the investigation of this concomitant vaccination.

## Safety

The observational safety objectives were to describe the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and Menveo when administered concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines in healthy infants and toddlers in Mexico (Group 1 vs Group 2) and the Russian Federation (Group 3) and to describe the safety profile of routine pediatric vaccines in Mexico (Groups 1 and 2) and the Russian Federation (Groups 3 and 4).

Immediate unsolicited systemic AEs were collected within 30 minutes after each vaccination. Other unsolicited AEs were evaluated up to D30 after each vaccination. Solicited AE information (injection site reactions and systemic reactions) were collected from D0 to D07 after each vaccination. SAEs and AESIs were collected throughout the study. These measurements are considered appropriate. The discussion on safety data below refers to the overall safety analysis set. Individual safety analysis sets at 2, 3, 4, 4.5, 6 and 12 months of age will not be discussed in detail, as data do not refer to a licensed population (all subjects are below 12 years of age, have received at least two meningococcal vaccinations against serogroups A, C, Y and W before the age of 12 months or have not received any meningococcal vaccinations against serogroups A, C, Y and W during the study) and the submission in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, as amended, does not address any extension of the current indication for MenQuadfi to vaccinate healthy infants. It is further critically noted that the study followed an open label design, which might influence the reporting of safety events.

## Mexico

The safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine was roughly comparable to that of Menveo when administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines, but the rate of reporting was mostly

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

higher for group 1 compared to group 2, except for grade 3 events, which were reported more frequently by subjects that have received Menveo . For instance, the percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited reaction within 7 days after vaccination were 89.5% (179/200) in Group 1 and 76.8% (76/99) in Group 2, and 20.0% (40/200) in Group 1 and 21.2% (21/99) in Group 2 reported at least 1 Grade 3 solicited reaction. The percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited injection site reaction were 78.0% (156/200) in Group 1 and 69.7% (69/99) in Group 2, and 12.0% (24/200) in Group 1 and 14.1% (14/99) in Group 2 reported at least one Grade 3 solicited injection site reaction. Specifically, the percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited injection site reaction at the MenACYW/Menveo injection site were 64.5% (129/200) and 63.6% (63/99), respectively. Also the safety profile of solicited injection site reactions after routine paediatric vaccines was roughly comparable between vaccine groups, but with slightly higher frequencies in group 1. For instance, the percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited injection site reaction at the Prevnar13 vaccine site were 67.0% (134/200) in Group 1 and 59.6% (59/99) in Group 2. The most frequently reported solicited injection site reactions after MenACYW in Group 1 were injection site tenderness reported by 60.5% (121/200) of subjects followed by injection site erythema (26.0% [52/200] of subjects) and injection site swelling (12.0% [24/200] of subjects)  Similarly, after Menveo the most frequently reported solicited injection site reactions in Group 2 were also injection site tenderness, reported by 60.6% (60/99) of subjects followed by injection site erythema (13.1% [13/99] of subjects) and injection site swelling (9.1%[9/99] of subjects). Hence, erythema occurred about twice as frequently after MenACYW compared to Menveo , which should be anticipated for subjects following the depicted vaccination strategy with MenQuadfi , compared to the scheme with Menveo in group 2. For either vaccine most of the injection site reactions were Grade 1 or 2 and resolved within 1-3 days of occurrence.

Comparable to the pattern for reported frequencies for local reactions, the percentages of subjects reporting at least one solicited systemic reaction were 81.5% (163/200) in Group 1 and 70.7% (70/99) in Group 2, and 11.5% (23/200) in Group 1 and 12.1% (12/99) in Group 2 reported at least one Grade 3 solicited systemic reaction. The most frequently reported solicited systemic reactions were irritability, reported by 67.0% (134/200) of subjects in Group 1 and 58.6% (58/99) subjects in Group 2 followed by abnormal Crying (58.5% [117/200] in Group 1 and 50.5% (50/99) in Group 2). Fever (42.2% [84/199] subjects in Group 1 and 33.7% [33/98] subjects in Group 2), drowsiness (40.0% [80/200] subjects in Group 1 and 36.4% [36/99] subjects in Group 2), lost appetite (36.0% [72/200] subjects in Group 1 and 33.3% [33/99] subjects in Group 2), and vomiting (19.5% [39/200] subjects in Group 1 and 11.1% [11/99] subjects in Group 2) were also commonly reported and all with a mildly higher frequency for group 1. The percentages of subjects reporting at least one Grade 3 solicited systemic reaction were 11.5% (23/200) in Group 1 and 12.1% (12/99) in Group 2. Most of the solicited systemic reactions were Grade 1 or 2 and resolved within 1-3 days of occurrence.

Taken together, solicited systemic reactions occurred numerically more often after MenACYW compared to Menveo. For the overall safety analysis set is to be noted that subjects in group 2 received 1 additional vaccination (with Menveo at 4 months of age) compared to subjects in group 1, which might have an effect on reporting rates. Thus, it can be concluded that MenQuadfi appears slightly more reactogenic compared to Menveo in infants and toddlers, which might be related to the total lower content of Neisseria meningitidis polysaccharide and/or the difference in conjugated proteins (tetanus toxoid carrier protein for MenQuadfi and Corynebacterium diphtheriae CRM 197 protein for Menveo).

No immediate unsolicited AEs or ARs were recorded within 30 minutes of any vaccination in any group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AE (between D0 and D30) was comparable between Group 1 and Group 2 (49.8% in Group 1 and 47.5% in Group 2). Unsolicited nonserious AEs were mainly reported in the following SOCs: 'Infections and Infestations' (43.3% [87/201]; mainly nasopharyngitis), 'Gastrointestinal Disorders' (8.0% [16/201]; mainly diarrhoea), and 'General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions' (7.0% [14/201]; mainly injection site haematoma) in Group 1 and 'Infections and Infestations' (34.3% [34/99]; mainly nasopharyngitis), 'General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions' (17.2% [17/99]; mainly injection site haematoma), and 'Gastrointestinal Disorders' (12.1% [12/99]; mainly diarrhoea) in Group 2. The percentage of subjects who reported at least 1 Grade 3 unsolicited non-serious AE was 3.0% (6/201) in Group 1. No subjects in Group 2 reported any Grade 3 unsolicited non-serious AEs. The percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AR (between D0 and D30) was comparable between Group 1 (2.0% [4/201]) and Group 2 (2.0% [2/99]). All unsolicited non-serious ARs were Grade 1 or Grade 2. Most of the unsolicited non-serious ARs lasted for up to 7 days. Unsolicited nonserious ARs were mainly reported in the SOC 'General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions' in both groups (2.0% [4/201] in Group 1 and 2.0% [2/99] in Group 2; mainly injection site haemorrhage and injection site haematoma). No concerns arise from reported unsolicited ARs.

No deaths were reported in the Mexican cohort. No subjects in Groups 1 or 2 were discontinued from the study due to an AE. However, seven subjects experienced at least 1 SAE during the study period: 2.0% (4/201) subjects in Group 1 and 3.0% (3/99) subjects in Group 2. The SAEs in Group 1 were seizure (1), pneumonia (2) and Head injury (1). The SAEs in Group 2 were bronchiolitis (2) and febrile seizure (1). Hence, respiratory tract infections were the most frequent SAE in both groups. The percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 AESI were 0.5% (1/201; grade 3 seizures) in Group 1 and 1.0% (1/99; grade 3 febrile convulsions) in Group 2. None of the SAEs or AESIs was considered related to vaccination, which is reassuring and can be followed based on provided narratives. A total of 190 (95.0%) subjects in Group 1 and 92 (92.0%) subjects in Group 2 completed the study, indicating a high and comparable vaccination acceptance for MenACYW and MENVEO vaccines.

## Russian Federation

The percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited reaction were 42.7% (64/150) in Group 3 and 45.3% (34/75) in Group 4, and 0.7% (1/150) in Group 3 reported at least 1 Grade 3 solicited reaction. No Grade 3 solicited reaction was reported in Group 4.

The percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited injection site reaction were 22.0% (33/150) in Group 3 and 16.0% (12/75) in Group 4. No Grade 3 injection site reactions were reported in Groups 3 and 4. The percentage of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited injection site reaction at the MenACYW conjugate vaccine site was 11.4% (17/149). The percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited injection site reaction after a routine paediatric vaccine were similarly low but comparable between Groups 3 and 4 (e.g. Prevnar13 vaccine site: 8.7% [13/150] vs 10.7% [8/75]). The most frequently reported solicited injection site reactions after MenACYW in Group 3 were injection site erythema, reported by 7.4% (11/149) of subjects followed by injection site tenderness (6.0% [9/149] of subjects) and injection site swelling (4.0% [6/149] of subjects). Most of the injection site reactions resolved within 1-3 days of occurrence.

The percentages of subjects reporting at least one solicited systemic reaction were 34.0% (51/150) in Group 3 and 38.7% (29/75) in Group 4, and 0.7% (1/150) in Group 3 reported at least one Grade 3 solicited systemic reaction. No Grade 3 systemic reactions were reported in Group 4. The most frequently reported solicited systemic reactions in Group 3 were drowsiness, reported by 22.0% (33/150) subjects followed by irritability that was reported by 21.3% (32/150) of subjects. The most frequently reported solicited systemic reactions in Group 4 were irritability, reported by 26.7% (20/75)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects followed by drowsiness (22.7% [17/75] of subjects). Lost Appetite (17.3% [26/150] subjects in Group 3 and 14.7% [11/75] subjects in Group 4), abnormal crying (12.0% [18/150] subjects in Group 3 and 8.0% [6/75] subjects in Group 4), and fever (7.4% [11//149] subjects in Group 3 and 8.0% [6/75] subjects in Group 4) were also common. Most of the solicited systemic reactions resolved within 1-3 days of occurrence. Hence, overall comparable safety profiles were observed for Groups 3 and 4.

No immediate unsolicited AEs or ARs were recorded within 30 minutes of any vaccination in any group.

The percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AE was comparable between Group 3 and Group 4 (10.0% [15/150] in Group 3 and 8.0% [6/75] in Group 4). All the unsolicited non-serious AEs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2. Unsolicited non-serious AEs were mainly reported in the following SOCs: 'Infections and Infestations' (6.0% [9/150] subjects in Group 3 and 5.3% [4/75] subjects in Group 4; mainly rhinitis) and 'Gastrointestinal Disorders' (2.7% [4/150] subjects in Group 3 and 2.7% [2/75] subjects in Group 4). There were no unsolicited non-serious ARs reported in Groups 3 and 4 within 30 days after vaccine injection.

No deaths were reported in the Russian cohort. No subjects in Groups 3 or 4 were discontinued from the study due to an AE. Six subjects experienced at least 1 SAE during the study period: 2.7% (4/150) subjects in Group 3 and 2.7% (2/75) subjects in Group 4. The SAEs in Group 3 were viral enterocolitis (2), atonic seizure (1) and COVID-19 (1). Hence, infections and seizures were reported as most frequent SAEs after MenACYW as for the Mexican cohort. The SAEs in Group 4 were bone fracture (1) and pneumonia (1). The percentage of subjects who reported at least 1 AESI was 0.7% (1/150) in Group 3 (grade 1 atonic seizure). None of the SAEs or AESIs was considered related to vaccination which is reassuring and can be followed based on provided narratives. A total of 148 (98.7%) subjects in Group 3 and 75 (100.0%) subjects in Group 4 completed the study, indicating a high vaccination acceptance.

Of note, the observed frequency of AEs reported in the Russian Federation was generally substantially lower than in Mexico. According to the MAH´s literature analysis, this pattern can be regularly observed in clinical studies of paediatric vaccines in the Russian Federation, which is acknowledged. However, reasons for this discrepancy are not entirely clear.

Overall, the administration of MenACYW conjugate vaccine as evaluated in study MET33 yielded no significant or unexpected safety concerns in healthy infants and toddlers aged 2 to 12 months in Mexico and the Russian Federation.

## 3.  Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The study population of MET33 is not covered by the EU Marketing Authorisation of MenQuadfi, which is currently indicated from the age of 12 months and older.

The purpose of MET33 was to demonstrate that the safety profile and immunogenicity of the 3-dose series of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (MenQuadfi) is similar to that of a 4-dose series of Menveo when starting immunisation at 2 months of age and administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines given to healthy infants and toddlers in Mexico, and to demonstrate that the safety profile and immunogenicity of MenACYW conjugate vaccine is similar when given concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines given to healthy infants and toddlers in the Russian Federation. It is critically noted that the study design does not address any possible consequence of the concomitant vaccination with routine paediatric vaccines on the immunogenicity profile of MenQuadfi (i.e., MenQuadfi alone vs. MenQuadfi + routine vaccines). One study arm with a sequential administration of MenQuadfi and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

routine vaccines (that would still allow to provide the routine vaccination to all children) could have provided further insight in this aspect. However, the adequacy of the study design to investigate the appropriateness of concomitant vaccination will need to be assessed in the intended future application.

The submitted results of study MET33 comprised descriptive immunogenicity data for MenQuadfi, the comparator vaccine Menveo and concomitant paediatric vaccines as well as safety data sets summarizing AEs that occurred during the study. Overall, MenQuadfi showed a slightly higher immunogenicity than Menveo. Routine paediatric vaccines showed comparable immunogenicity when administered concomitantly with MenQuadfi or Menveo in healthy infants and toddlers. The safety profile of MenQuadfi was roughly comparable to Menveo. However, it is critically noted that no hypotheses testing was planned for the study and that the study followed an open label design, which might influence the reporting of safety events.

The adequacy of Menveo as comparator vaccine is questionable as Menveo is not licensed for the respective age group in the EU. This aspect requires further elaboration for any future variation application. Similarly, the use of administered concomitant vaccines should be justified based on EU standards (i.e., licensure of vaccines used and vaccine schedule). Furthermore, serious adverse events (especially those related to respiratory and gastrointestinal infections as well as seizures) should be discussed in detail once all data of the clinical program in subjects &lt;12 years become available.

Study MET33 is part of the MenQuadfi Paediatric Investigational Plan EMEA-001930-PIP01-16-M04). The MAH´s plan is to complete all the ongoing paediatric clinical studies MET33, MET41, MET42, MET52, MET58, MET61 covering 6 weeks to 12 months population prior to submit all the data together under a type II variation with Product Information update to support the extension of indication for use of MenQuadfi in individuals from the age of 6 weeks and older (planned submission Q1 2025 in the EU).
