This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

<!-- image -->

Treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in children and adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate.

LIFMIOR 25 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection. 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each vial contains 25 mg of etanercept. Etanercept is a human tumour necrosis factor receptor p75 Fc fusion protein produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian expression system. Etanercept is a dimer of a chimeric protein genetically engineered by fusing the extracellular ligand binding domain of human tumour necrosis factor receptor-2 (TNFR2/p75) to the Fc domain of human IgG1. This Fc component contains the hinge, CH 2 and CH3 regions, but not the CH 1 region of IgG1. Etanercept contains 934 amino acids and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons. The specific activity of etanercept is 1.7 x 10 6 units/mg. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Powder and solvent for solution for injection (powder for injection). The powder is white. The solvent is a clear, colourless liquid. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rheumatoid arthritis LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including methotrexate (unless contraindicated), has been inadequate. LIFMIOR can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. LIFMIOR is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated with methotrexate. LIFMIOR, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis Medicinal product no longer authorised

Treatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy.

LIFMIOR has not been studied in children aged less than 2 years.

Posology

Rheumatoid arthritis

Psoriatic arthritis Treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. LIFMIOR has been shown to improve physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease. Axial spondyloarthritis Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) Treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis Treatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence, who have had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Plaque psoriasis Treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy, including ciclosporin, methotrexate or psoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA) (see section 5.1). Paediatric plaque psoriasis Treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies. 4.2 Posology and method of administration LIFMIOR treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis or paediatric plaque psoriasis. Patients treated with LIFMIOR should be given the Patient Alert Card. LIFMIOR is available in strengths of 10, 25 and 50 mg. 25 mg LIFMIOR administered twice weekly is the recommended dose. Alternatively, 50 mg administered once weekly has been shown to be safe and effective (see section 5.1). Psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis The recommended dose is 25 mg LIFMIOR administered twice weekly, or 50 mg administered once weekly. Medicinal product no longer authorised

For all of the above indications, available data suggest that a clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Plaque psoriasis

The recommended dose of LIFMIOR is 25 mg administered twice weekly or 50 mg administered once weekly. Alternatively, 50 mg given twice weekly may be used for up to 12 weeks followed, if necessary, by a dose of 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once weekly. Treatment with LIFMIOR should continue until remission is achieved, for up to 24 weeks. Continuous therapy beyond 24 weeks may be appropriate for some adult patients (see section 5.1). Treatment should be discontinued in patients who show no response after 12 weeks. If re-treatment with LIFMIOR is indicated, the same guidance on treatment duration should be followed. The dose should be 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once weekly.

Special populations Renal and hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required. Elderly No dose adjustment is required. Posology and administration are the same as for adults 18-64 years of age. Paediatric population Juvenile idiopathic arthritis The recommended dose is 0.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 25 mg per dose), given twice weekly as a subcutaneous injection with an interval of 3-4 days between doses or 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) given once weekly. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered in patients who show no response after 4 months. The 10 mg vial strength may be more appropriate for administration to children with JIA below the weight of 25 kg. No formal clinical trials have been conducted in children aged 2 to 3 years. However, limited safety data from a patient registry suggest that the safety profile in children from 2 to 3 years of age is similar to that seen in adults and children aged 4 years and older, when dosed every week with 0.8 mg/kg subcutaneously (see section 5.1). There is generally no applicable use of LIFMIOR in children aged below 2 years in the indication juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Paediatric plaque psoriasis (age 6 years and above) The recommended dose is 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly for up to 24 weeks. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who show no response after 12 weeks. If re-treatment with LIFMIOR is indicated, the above guidance on treatment duration should be followed. The dose should be 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly. There is generally no applicable use of LIFMIOR in children aged below 6 years in the indication plaque psoriasis. Method of administration LIFMIOR is administered by subcutaneous injection. LIFMIOR powder for solution must be reconstituted in 1 ml of solvent before use (see section 6.6). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Comprehensive instructions for the preparation and administration of the reconstituted LIFMIOR vial are given in the package leaflet, section 7, \"Instructions for preparation and giving an injection of LIFMIOR.\"

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Sepsis or risk of sepsis.

Treatment with LIFMIOR should not be initiated in patients with active infections, including chronic or localised infections. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trademark and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. Infections Patients should be evaluated for infections before, during, and after treatment with LIFMIOR, taking into consideration that the mean elimination half-life of etanercept is approximately 70 hours (range 7 to 300 hours). Serious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis, and opportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections, listeriosis and legionellosis, have been reported with the use of LIFMIOR (see section 4.8). These infections were due to bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites (including protozoa). In some cases, particular fungal and other opportunistic infections have not been recognised, resulting in delay of appropriate treatment and sometimes death. In evaluating patients for infections, the patient's risk for relevant opportunistic infections (e.g., exposure to endemic mycoses) should be considered. Patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with LIFMIOR should be monitored closely. Administration of LIFMIOR should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. The safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with chronic infections have not been evaluated. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of LIFMIOR in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions that may predispose patients to infections, such as advanced or poorly controlled diabetes. Tuberculosis Cases of active tuberculosis, including miliary tuberculosis and tuberculosis with extra-pulmonary location, have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Before starting treatment with LIFMIOR, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive ('latent') tuberculosis. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with personal history of tuberculosis or possible previous contact with tuberculosis and previous and/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests, i.e., tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the conduct of these tests should be recorded in the patient's alert card. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised. Medicinal product no longer authorised

If active tuberculosis is diagnosed, LIFMIOR therapy must not be initiated. If inactive ('latent') tuberculosis is diagnosed, treatment for latent tuberculosis must be started with anti-tuberculosis therapy before the initiation of LIFMIOR, and in accordance with local recommendations. In this situation, the benefit/risk balance of LIFMIOR therapy should be very carefully considered. All patients should be informed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low-grade fever) appear during or after LIFMIOR treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatitis B reactivation

Reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were previously infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and had received concomitant TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR, has been reported. This includes reports of reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were anti-HBc positive but HBsAg negative. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with LIFMIOR. For patients who test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. Caution should be exercised when administering LIFMIOR in patients previously infected with HBV. These patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several weeks following termination of therapy. Adequate data from treating patients infected with HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy are not available. In patients who develop HBV infection, LIFMIOR should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.

Reports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have been received in the postmarketing period (see section 4.8).

Worsening of hepatitis C There have been reports of worsening of hepatitis C in patients receiving LIFMIOR. LIFMIOR should be used with caution in patients with a history of hepatitis C. Concurrent treatment with anakinra Concurrent administration of LIFMIOR and anakinra has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections and neutropenia compared to LIFMIOR alone. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit. Thus, the combined use of LIFMIOR and anakinra is not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). Concurrent treatment with abatacept In clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and LIFMIOR resulted in increased incidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.5). Allergic reactions Allergic reactions associated with LIFMIOR administration have been reported commonly. Allergic reactions have included angioedema and urticaria; serious reactions have occurred. If any serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, LIFMIOR therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. Immunosuppression The possibility exists for TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR, to affect host defences against infections and malignancies since TNF mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune responses. In a study of 49 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with LIFMIOR, there was no evidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in enumeration of effector cell populations. Two juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients developed varicella infection and signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae. Patients with a significant exposure to varicella virus should temporarily discontinue LIFMIOR therapy and be considered for prophylactic treatment with Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin. The safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with immunosuppression have not been evaluated. Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders Solid and haematopoietic malignancies (excluding skin cancers) Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. However, the occurrence was rare, and the follow-up period of placebo patients was shorter than for patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

receiving TNF-antagonist therapy. In the postmarketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, which complicates risk estimation.

Based on current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia or other haematopoietic or solid malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. Caution should be exercised when considering TNF-antagonist therapy for patients with a history of malignancy or when considering continuing treatment in patients who develop a malignancy.

There have been rare reports of CNS demyelinating disorders in patients treated with LIFMIOR (see section 4.8). Additionally, there have been rare reports of peripheral demyelinating polyneuropathies (including Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy). Although no clinical trials have been performed evaluating LIFMIOR therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis, clinical trials of other TNF antagonists in patients with multiple sclerosis have shown increases in disease activity. A careful risk/benefit evaluation, including a neurologic assessment, is recommended when prescribing

Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to 22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including LIFMIOR, in the postmarketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies typically associated with immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. Skin cancers Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) have been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR. Postmarketing cases of Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported very infrequently in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Periodic skin examination is recommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer. Combining the results of controlled clinical trials, more cases of NMSC were observed in patients receiving LIFMIOR compared with control patients, particularly in patients with psoriasis. Vaccinations Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with LIFMIOR. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving LIFMIOR. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical study in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis, 184 patients also received a multivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at week 4. In this study, most psoriatic arthritis patients receiving LIFMIOR were able to mount effective B-cell immune response to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, but titres in aggregate were moderately lower, and few patients had two-fold rises in titres compared to patients not receiving LIFMIOR. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Autoantibody formation Treatment with LIFMIOR may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies (see section 4.8). Haematologic reactions Rare cases of pancytopenia and very rare cases of aplastic anaemia, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Caution should be exercised in patients being treated with LIFMIOR who have a previous history of blood dyscrasias. All patients and parents/caregivers should be advised that if the patient develops signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infections (e.g., persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding, paleness) whilst on LIFMIOR, they should seek immediate medical advice. Such patients should be investigated urgently, including full blood count; if blood dyscrasias are confirmed, LIFMIOR should be discontinued. Neurological disorders Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

LIFMIOR to patients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating disease, or to those who are considered to have an increased risk of developing demyelinating disease.

## Combination therapy

In a controlled clinical trial of two years duration in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the combination of LIFMIOR and methotrexate did not result in unexpected safety findings, and the safety profile of LIFMIOR when given in combination with methotrexate was similar to the profiles reported in studies of LIFMIOR and methotrexate alone. Long-term studies to assess the safety of the combination are ongoing. The long-term safety of LIFMIOR in combination with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) has not been established.

Special populations

In the Phase 3 studies in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, no overall differences in adverse events, serious adverse events, and serious infections in patients age 65 or older who received LIFMIOR were observed compared with younger patients. However, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly and particular attention paid with respect to occurrence of infections.

The use of LIFMIOR in combination with other systemic therapies or phototherapy for the treatment of psoriasis has not been studied. Renal and hepatic impairment Based on pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2), no dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal or hepatic impairment; clinical experience in such patients is limited. Congestive heart failure (Cardiac failure congestive) Physicians should use caution when using LIFMIOR in patients who have congestive heart failure (CHF). There have been postmarketing reports of worsening of CHF, with and without identifiable precipitating factors, in patients taking LIFMIOR. There have also been rare (&lt; 0.1%) reports of new onset CHF, including CHF in patients without known pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Some of these patients have been under 50 years of age. Two large clinical trials evaluating the use of LIFMIOR in the treatment of CHF were terminated early due to lack of efficacy. Although not conclusive, data from one of these trials suggest a possible tendency toward worsening CHF in those patients assigned to LIFMIOR treatment. Alcoholic hepatitis In a phase II randomised placebo-controlled study of 48 hospitalised patients treated with LIFMIOR or placebo for moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis, LIFMIOR was not efficacious, and the mortality rate in patients treated with LIFMIOR was significantly higher after 6 months. Consequently, LIFMIOR should not be used in patients for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. Physicians should use caution when using LIFMIOR in patients who also have moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis. Wegener's granulomatosis A placebo-controlled trial, in which 89 adult patients were treated with LIFMIOR in addition to standard therapy (including cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, and glucocorticoids) for a median duration of 25 months, has not shown LIFMIOR to be an effective treatment for Wegener's granulomatosis. The incidence of non-cutaneous malignancies of various types was significantly higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR than in the control group. LIFMIOR is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis. Hypoglycaemia in patients treated for diabetes There have been reports of hypoglycaemia following initiation of LIFMIOR in patients receiving medication for diabetes, necessitating a reduction in anti-diabetic medication in some of these patients. Elderly Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

## Vaccinations

It is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating LIFMIOR therapy (see Vaccinations, above).

Developmental toxicity studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of harm to the foetus or neonatal rat due to etanercept. The effects of etanercept on pregnancy outcomes have been investigated in two observational cohort studies. A higher rate of major birth defects was observed in one observational study comparing pregnancies exposed to etanercept (n=370) during the first trimester with pregnancies not exposed to etanercept or other TNF-antagonists (n=164) (adjusted odds ratio 2.4, 95% CI: 1.0-5.5). The types of major birth defects were consistent with those most

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and uveitis in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) There have been reports of IBD and uveitis in JIA patients being treated with LIFMIOR (see section 4.8). 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concurrent treatment with anakinra Adult patients treated with LIFMIOR and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious infection when compared with patients treated with either LIFMIOR or anakinra alone (historical data). In addition, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients receiving background methotrexate, patients treated with LIFMIOR and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with LIFMIOR (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The combination LIFMIOR and anakinra has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit, and is therefore not recommended. Concurrent treatment with abatacept In clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and LIFMIOR resulted in increased incidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.4). Concurrent treatment with sulfasalazine In a clinical study of adult patients who were receiving established doses of sulfasalazine, to which LIFMIOR was added, patients in the combination group experienced a statistically significant decrease in mean white blood cell counts in comparison to groups treated with LIFMIOR or sulfasalazine alone. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Physicians should use caution when considering combination therapy with sulfasalazine. Non-interactions In clinical trials, no interactions have been observed when LIFMIOR was administered with glucocorticoids, salicylates (except sulfasalazine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, or methotrexate. See section 4.4 for vaccination advice. No clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions were observed in studies with methotrexate, digoxin or warfarin. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential Women of childbearing potential should consider the use of appropriate contraception to avoid becoming pregnant during LIFMIOR therapy and for three weeks after discontinuation of therapy. Pregnancy Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

commonly reported in the general population and no particular pattern of abnormalities was identified. No change in the rate of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or minor malformations was observed. In another observational multi-country registry study comparing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to etanercept during the first 90 days of pregnancy (n=425) to those exposed to non-biologic drugs (n=3497), there was no observed increased risk of major birth defects (crude odds ratio [OR]= 1.22, 95% CI: 0.79-1.90; adjusted OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.58-1.60 after adjusting for country, maternal disease, parity, maternal age and smoking in early pregnancy). This study also showed no increased risks of minor birth defects, preterm birth, stillbirth, or infections in the first year of life for infants born to women exposed to etanercept during pregnancy. LIFMIOR should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed.

Etanercept crosses the placenta and has been detected in the serum of infants born to female patients treated with LIFMIOR during pregnancy. The clinical impact of this is unknown, however, infants may be at increased risk of infection. Administration of live vaccines to infants for 16 weeks after the mother's last dose of LIFMIOR is generally not recommended. Breast-feeding Etanercept has been reported to be excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration. In lactating rats following subcutaneous administration, etanercept was excreted in the milk and detected in the serum of pups. Because immunoglobulins, in common with many medicinal products, can be excreted in human milk, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue LIFMIOR therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. Fertility Preclinical data about peri- and postnatal toxicity of etanercept and of effects of etanercept on fertility and general reproductive performance are not available. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The most commonly reported adverse reactions are injection site reactions (such as pain, swelling, itching, reddening and bleeding at the puncture site), infections (such as upper respiratory infections, bronchitis, bladder infections and skin infections), allergic reactions, development of autoantibodies, itching, and fever. Serious adverse reactions have also been reported for LIFMIOR. TNF-antagonists, such as LIFMIOR, affect the immune system and their use may affect the body's defenses against infection and cancer. Serious infections affect fewer than 1 in 100 patients treated with LIFMIOR. Reports have included fatal and life-threatening infections and sepsis. Various malignancies have also been reported with use of LIFMIOR, including cancers of the breast, lung, skin and lymph glands (lymphoma). Serious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These include rare reports of pancytopenia and very rare reports of aplastic anaemia. Central and peripheral demyelinating events have been seen rarely and very rarely, respectively, with LIFMIOR use. There have been rare reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions, and vasculitis.

Compared to placebo, patients with rheumatic diseases treated with LIFMIOR had a significantly higher incidence of injection site reactions (36% vs. 9%). Injection site reactions usually occurred in the first month. Mean duration was approximately 3 to 5 days. No treatment was given for the majority of injection site reactions in the LIFMIOR treatment groups, and the majority of patients who were given treatment received topical preparations, such as corticosteroids, or oral antihistamines. Additionally, some patients developed recall injection site reactions characterised by a skin reaction at the most recent site of injection, along with the simultaneous appearance of injection site reactions at previous injection sites. These reactions were generally transient and did not recur with treatment.

Description of selected adverse reactions Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders One hundred and twenty-nine (129) new malignancies of various types were observed in 4,114 rheumatoid arthritis patients treated in clinical trials with LIFMIOR for up to approximately 6 years, including 231 patients treated with LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate in the 2-year active-controlled study. The observed rates and incidences in these clinical trials were similar to those expected for the population studied. A total of 2 malignancies were reported in clinical studies of approximately 2 years duration involving 240 LIFMIOR-treated psoriatic arthritis patients. In clinical studies conducted for more than 2 years with 351 ankylosing spondylitis patients, 6 malignancies were reported in LIFMIOR-treated patients. In a group of 2,711 plaque psoriasis patients treated with LIFMIOR in double-blind and open-label studies of up to 2.5 years, 30 malignancies and 43 nonmelanoma skin cancers were reported. In a group of 7,416 patients treated with LIFMIOR in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis clinical trials, 18 lymphomas were reported. Reports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have also been received in the postmarketing period (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In controlled trials in patients with plaque psoriasis, approximately 13.6% of patients treated with LIFMIOR developed injection site reactions compared with 3.4% of placebo-treated patients during the first 12 weeks of treatment.

## Serious infections

In placebo-controlled trials, no increase in the incidence of serious infections (fatal, life-threatening, or requiring hospitalisation or intravenous antibiotics) was observed. Serious infections occurred in 6.3% of rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with LIFMIOR for up to 48 months. These included abscess (at various sites), bacteraemia, bronchitis, bursitis, cellulitis, cholecystitis, diarrhoea, diverticulitis, endocarditis (suspected), gastroenteritis, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, leg ulcer, mouth infection, osteomyelitis, otitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, sepsis, septic arthritis, sinusitis, skin infection, skin ulcer, urinary tract infection, vasculitis, and wound infection. In the 2-year active-controlled study where patients were treated with either LIFMIOR alone, methotrexate alone or LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate, the rates of serious infections were similar among the treatment groups. However, it cannot be excluded that the combination of LIFMIOR with methotrexate could be associated with an increase in the rate of infections. There were no differences in rates of infection among patients treated with LIFMIOR and those treated with placebo for plaque psoriasis in placebo-controlled trials of up to 24 weeks duration. Serious infections experienced by LIFMIOR-treated patients included cellulitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, cholecystitis, osteomyelitis, gastritis, appendicitis, Streptococcal fasciitis, myositis, septic shock, diverticulitis and abscess. In the double-blind and open-label psoriatic arthritis trials, 1 patient reported a serious infection (pneumonia). Serious and fatal infections have been reported during use of LIFMIOR; reported pathogens include bacteria, mycobacteria (including tuberculosis), viruses and fungi. Some have occurred within a few weeks after initiating treatment with LIFMIOR in patients who have underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes, congestive heart failure, history of active or chronic infections) in addition to their rheumatoid arthritis (see section 4.4). LIFMIOR treatment may increase mortality in patients with established sepsis. Opportunistic infections have been reported in association with LIFMIOR, including invasive fungal, parasitic (including protozoal), viral (including herpes zoster), bacterial (including Listeria and Legionella ), and atypical mycobacterial infections. In a pooled data set of clinical trials, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was 0.09% for the 15,402 subjects who received LIFMIOR. The exposure-adjusted rate was 0.06 events per 100 patient-years. In postmarketing experience, approximately half of all of the case reports of opportunistic infections worldwide were invasive fungal infections. The most commonly reported invasive fungal infections included Candida, Pneumocystis, Aspergillus, and Histoplasma . Invasive fungal infections accounted for more than half of the fatalities amongst patients who developed opportunistic infections. The majority of the reports with a fatal outcome were in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, unspecified systemic fungal infections, and aspergillosis (see section 4.4). Autoantibodies Medicinal product no longer authorised

Adult patients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple timepoints. Of the rheumatoid arthritis patients evaluated for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), the percentage of patients who developed new positive ANA ( ≥ 1:40) was higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR (11%) than in placebotreated patients (5%). The percentage of patients who developed new positive anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies was also higher by radioimmunoassay (15% of patients treated with LIFMIOR compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients) and by Crithidia luciliae assay (3% of patients treated with LIFMIOR compared to none of placebo-treated patients). The proportion of patients treated with LIFMIOR who developed anticardiolipin antibodies was similarly increased compared to placebotreated patients. The impact of long-term treatment with LIFMIOR on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There have been rare reports of patients, including rheumatoid factor positive patients, who have developed other autoantibodies in conjunction with a lupus-like syndrome or rashes that are compatible with subacute cutaneous lupus or discoid lupus by clinical presentation and biopsy.

## Pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia

There have been postmarketing reports of pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia, some of which had fatal outcomes (see section 4.4).

In one study in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis aged 4 to 17 years, 43 of 69 (62%) children experienced an infection while receiving LIFMIOR during 3 months of the study (part 1, open-label), and the frequency and severity of infections was similar in 58 patients completing 12 months of openlabel extension therapy. The types and proportion of adverse events in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients were similar to those seen in trials of LIFMIOR in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and the majority were mild. Several adverse events were reported more commonly in 69 juvenile

Interstitial lung disease In controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of interstitial lung disease in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.06% (frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of interstitial lung disease was 0.47% (frequency uncommon). There have been postmarketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of which had fatal outcomes. Concurrent treatment with anakinra In studies when adult patients received concurrent treatment with LIFMIOR plus anakinra, a higher rate of serious infections compared to LIFMIOR alone was observed and 2% of patients (3/139) developed neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1000/mm 3 ). While neutropenic, one patient developed cellulitis that resolved after hospitalisation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). Elevated liver enzymes In the double-blind periods of controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.54% (frequency uncommon). In the double-blind periods of controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes was 4.18% (frequency common). Autoimmune hepatitis In controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.02% (frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of autoimmune hepatitis was 0.24% (frequency uncommon). Paediatric population Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis In general, the adverse events in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult patients. Differences from adults and other special considerations are discussed in the following paragraphs. The types of infections seen in clinical trials in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients aged 2 to 18 years were generally mild to moderate and consistent with those commonly seen in outpatient paediatric populations. Severe adverse events reported included varicella with signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae (see also section 4.4), appendicitis, gastroenteritis, depression/personality disorder, cutaneous ulcer, oesophagitis/gastritis, group A streptococcal septic shock, type I diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and post-operative wound infection.

idiopathic arthritis patients receiving 3 months of LIFMIOR compared to the 349 adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. These included headache (19% of patients, 1.7 events per patient year), nausea (9%, 1.0 event per patient year), abdominal pain (19%, 0.74 events per patient year), and vomiting (13%, 0.74 events per patient year).

There were 4 reports of macrophage activation syndrome in juvenile idiopathic arthritis clinical trials.

There have been reports of inflammatory bowel disease and uveitis in JIA patients being treated with LIFMIOR from post-marketing sources, including a very small number of cases indicating a positive rechallenge (see section 4.4). Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis In a 48-week study in 211 children aged 4 to 17 years with paediatric plaque psoriasis, the adverse events reported were similar to those seen in previous studies in adults with plaque psoriasis. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose No dose-limiting toxicities were observed during clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis patients. The highest dose level evaluated has been an intravenous loading dose of 32 mg/m 2 followed by subcutaneous doses of 16 mg/m 2 administered twice weekly. One rheumatoid arthritis patient mistakenly self-administered 62 mg LIFMIOR subcutaneously twice weekly for 3 weeks without experiencing undesirable effects. There is no known antidote to LIFMIOR. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors, ATC code: L04AB01 Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a dominant cytokine in the inflammatory process of rheumatoid arthritis. Elevated levels of TNF are also found in the synovium and psoriatic plaques of patients with psoriatic arthritis and in serum and synovial tissue of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. In plaque psoriasis, infiltration by inflammatory cells, including T-cells, leads to increased TNF levels in psoriatic lesions compared with levels in uninvolved skin. Etanercept is a competitive inhibitor of TNF binding to its cell surface receptors, and thereby inhibits the biological activity of TNF. TNF and lymphotoxin are pro-inflammatory cytokines that bind to two distinct cell surface receptors: the 55-kilodalton (p55) and 75-kilodalton (p75) tumour necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Both TNFRs exist naturally in membrane-bound and soluble forms. Soluble TNFRs are thought to regulate TNF biological activity. Medicinal product no longer authorised

TNF and lymphotoxin exist predominantly as homotrimers, with their biological activity dependent on cross-linking of cell surface TNFRs. Dimeric soluble receptors, such as etanercept, possess a higher affinity for TNF than monomeric receptors and are considerably more potent competitive inhibitors of TNF binding to its cellular receptors. In addition, use of an immunoglobulin Fc region as a fusion element in the construction of a dimeric receptor imparts a longer serum half-life.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Mechanism of action

Much of the joint pathology in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and skin pathology in plaque psoriasis is mediated by pro-inflammatory molecules that are linked in a network controlled by TNF. The mechanism of action of etanercept is thought to be its competitive inhibition of TNF binding to cell surface TNFR, preventing TNF-mediated cellular responses by rendering TNF biologically inactive. Etanercept may also modulate biologic responses controlled by additional downstream molecules (e.g., cytokines, adhesion molecules, or proteinases) that are induced or regulated by TNF.

The efficacy of LIFMIOR was compared to methotrexate in a randomised, active-controlled study with blinded radiographic evaluations as a primary endpoint in 632 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (&lt;3 years duration) who had never received treatment with methotrexate. Doses of 10 mg or 25 mg LIFMIOR were administered subcutaneously (SC) twice a week for up to 24 months. Methotrexate doses were escalated from 7.5 mg/week to a maximum of 20 mg/week over the first 8 weeks of the trial and continued for up to 24 months. Clinical improvement, including onset of action within 2 weeks with LIFMIOR 25 mg, was similar to that seen in the previous trials and was maintained for up to 24 months. At baseline, patients had a moderate degree of disability, with mean HAQ scores of 1.4 to 1.5. Treatment with LIFMIOR 25 mg resulted in substantial improvement at 12 months, with about 44% of patients achieving a normal HAQ score (less than 0.5). This benefit was maintained in Year 2 of this study.

Clinical efficacy and safety This section presents data from four randomised controlled trials in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, one study in adults with psoriatic arthritis, one study in adults with ankylosing spondylitis, one study in adults with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, four studies in adults with plaque psoriasis, three studies in juvenile idiopathic arthritis and one study in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. Adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis The efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study evaluated 234 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Doses of 10 mg or 25 mg LIFMIOR or placebo were administered subcutaneously twice a week for 6 consecutive months. The results of this controlled trial were expressed in percentage improvement in rheumatoid arthritis using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria. ACR 20 and 50 responses were higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR at 3 and 6 months than in patients treated with placebo (ACR 20: LIFMIOR 62% and 59%, placebo 23% and 11% at 3 and 6 months, respectively: ACR 50: LIFMIOR 41% and 40%, placebo 8% and 5% at months 3 and 6, respectively; p&lt;0.01 LIFMIOR vs. placebo at all timepoints for both ACR 20 and ACR 50 responses). Approximately 15% of subjects who received LIFMIOR achieved an ACR 70 response at month 3 and month 6 compared to fewer than 5% of subjects in the placebo arm. Among patients receiving LIFMIOR, the clinical responses generally appeared within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of therapy and nearly always occurred by 3 months. A dose response was seen; results with 10 mg were intermediate between placebo and 25 mg. LIFMIOR was significantly better than placebo in all components of the ACR criteria, as well as other measures of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity not included in the ACR response criteria, such as morning stiffness. A Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), which included disability, vitality, mental health, general health status, and arthritis-associated health status subdomains, was administered every 3 months during the trial. All subdomains of the HAQ were improved in patients treated with LIFMIOR compared to controls at 3 and 6 months. After discontinuation of LIFMIOR, symptoms of arthritis generally returned within a month. Re-introduction of treatment with LIFMIOR after discontinuation of up to 24 months resulted in the same magnitudes of responses as patients who received LIFMIOR without interruption of therapy based on results of open-label studies. Continued durable responses have been seen for up to 10 years in open-label extension treatment trials when patients received LIFMIOR without interruption. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In this study, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score. Radiographs of hands/wrists and feet were read at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months. The 10 mg LIFMIOR dose had consistently less effect on structural damage than the 25 mg dose. LIFMIOR 25 mg was significantly superior to methotrexate for erosion scores at both 12 and 24 months. The differences in TSS and JSN were not statistically significant between methotrexate and LIFMIOR 25 mg. The results are shown in the figure below.

Radiographic Progression: Comparison of LIFMIOR vs. Methotrexate in Patients with RA of &lt;3 Years Duration In another active-controlled, double-blind, randomised study, clinical efficacy, safety, and radiographic progression in RA patients treated with LIFMIOR alone (25 mg twice weekly), methotrexate alone (7.5 to 20 mg weekly, median dose 20 mg), and the combination of LIFMIOR and methotrexate initiated concurrently were compared in 682 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis of 6 months to 20 years duration (median 5 years) who had a less than satisfactory response to at least 1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) other than methotrexate. Patients in the LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate therapy group had significantly higher ACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70 responses and improvement for DAS and HAQ scores at both 24 and 52 weeks than patients in either of the single therapy groups (results shown in table below). Significant advantages for LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate compared with LIFMIOR monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months.

Significant advantages for LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate compared with LIFMIOR monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months. Similarly, the significant advantages for LIFMIOR monotherapy compared with methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months.

In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were considered to have progressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change ≤ 0.5) at 24 months was higher in the LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate group compared with the LIFMIOR alone and methotrexate alone groups (62%, 50%, and 36%, respectively; p&lt;0.05). The difference between LIFMIOR alone and methotrexate alone was also significant (p&lt;0.05). Among patients who completed a full 24 months of therapy in the study, the non-progression rates were 78%, 70%, and 61%, respectively. The safety and efficacy of 50 mg LIFMIOR (two 25 mg SC injections) administered once weekly were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 420 patients with active RA. In this study, 53 patients received placebo, 214 patients received 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly and 153 patients received 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly. The safety and efficacy profiles of the two LIFMIOR treatment regimens were comparable at week 8 in their effect on signs and symptoms of RA; data at week 16 did not show comparability (non-inferiority) between the two regimens. Adult patients with psoriatic arthritis The efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 205 patients with psoriatic arthritis. Patients were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active psoriatic arthritis ( ≥ 3 swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender joints) in at least one of the following forms: (1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement; (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of psoriasis); (3) arthritis mutilans; (4) asymmetric psoriatic arthritis; or (5) spondylitis-like ankylosis. Patients also had plaque psoriasis with a qualifying target lesion ≥ 2 cm in diameter. Patients had previously been treated with NSAIDs (86%), DMARDs (80%), and corticosteroids (24%). Patients currently on methotrexate therapy (stable for ≥ 2 months) could continue at a stable dose of ≤ 25 mg/week methotrexate. Doses of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (based on dose-finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered SC twice a week for 6 months. At the end of the double-blind study, patients could enter a long-term open-label extension study for a total duration of up to 2 years. Clinical responses were expressed as percentages of patients achieving the ACR 20, 50, and 70 response and percentages with improvement in Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC).

LIFMIOR treatment resulted in improvement in physical function during the double-blind period, and this benefit was maintained during the longer-term exposure of up to 2 years.

a: 25 mg LIFMIOR SC twice weekly b: p &lt; 0.001, LIFMIOR vs. placebo c: p &lt; 0.01, LIFMIOR vs. placebo Among patients with psoriatic arthritis who received LIFMIOR, the clinical responses were apparent at the time of the first visit (4 weeks) and were maintained through 6 months of therapy. LIFMIOR was significantly better than placebo in all measures of disease activity (p &lt; 0.001), and responses were similar with and without concomitant methotrexate therapy. Quality of life in psoriatic arthritis patients was assessed at every timepoint using the disability index of the HAQ. The disability index score was significantly improved at all timepoints in psoriatic arthritis patients treated with LIFMIOR, relative to placebo (p &lt; 0.001). Radiographic changes were assessed in the psoriatic arthritis study. Radiographs of hands and wrists were obtained at baseline and months 6, 12, and 24. The modified TSS at 12 months is presented in the table below. In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were considered to have progressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change ≤ 0.5) at 12 months was higher in the LIFMIOR group compared with the placebo group (73% vs. 47%, respectively, p ≤ 0.001). The effect of LIFMIOR on radiographic progression was maintained in patients who continued on treatment during the second year. The slowing of peripheral joint damage was observed in patients with polyarticular symmetrical joint involvement.

There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with ankylosing spondylitis-like and arthritis mutilans psoriatic arthropathies due to the small number of patients studied.

No study has been performed in patients with psoriatic arthritis using the 50 mg once-weekly dosing regimen. Evidence of efficacy for the once-weekly dosing regimen in this patient population has been based on data from the study in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.

## Adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis

The efficacy of LIFMIOR in ankylosing spondylitis was assessed in 3 randomised, double-blind studies comparing twice-weekly administration of 25 mg LIFMIOR with placebo. A total of 401 patients were enrolled, from which 203 were treated with LIFMIOR. The largest of these trials (n= 277) enrolled patients who were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active ankylosing spondylitis defined as visual analog scale (VAS) scores of ≥ 30 for average of duration and intensity of morning stiffness plus VAS scores of ≥ 30 for at least 2 of the following 3 parameters: patient global assessment; average of VAS values for nocturnal back pain and total back pain; average of 10 questions on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). Patients receiving DMARDs, NSAIDS, or corticosteroids could continue them on stable doses. Patients with complete ankylosis of the spine were not included in the study. Doses of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (based on dose-finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered subcutaneously twice a week for 6 months in 138 patients. The primary measure of efficacy (ASAS 20) was a ≥ 20% improvement in at least 3 of the 4 Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) domains (patient global assessments, back pain, BASFI, and inflammation) and absence of deterioration in the remaining domain. ASAS 50 and 70 responses used the same criteria with a 50% improvement or a 70% improvement, respectively. Compared to placebo, treatment with LIFMIOR resulted in significant improvements in the ASAS 20, ASAS 50 and ASAS 70 as early as 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy.

The efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpa) was assessed in a randomised, 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study evaluated 215 adult patients (modified intent-to-treat population) with active nr-AxSpa (18 to 49 years of age), defined as those patients meeting the ASAS classification criteria of axial spondyloarthritis but did not meet the modified New York criteria for AS. Patients were also required to have an inadequate response or intolerance to two or more NSAIDs. In the double-blind period, patients received LIFMIOR 50 mg weekly or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary measure of efficacy (ASAS 40) was a 40% improvement in at least three of the four ASAS domains and absence of deterioration in the remaining domain. The double-blind period was followed by an open-label period during which all patients receive LIFMIOR 50 mg weekly for up to an additional 92 weeks. MRIs of the sacroiliac joint and spine were obtained to assess inflammation at baseline and at weeks 12 and 104. Compared to placebo, treatment with LIFMIOR resulted in statistically significant improvement in the ASAS 40, ASAS 20 and ASAS 5/6. Significant improvement was also observed for the ASAS partial remission and BASDAI 50. Week 12 results are shown in the table below.

Adjusted mean change from baseline was 3.8 for LIFMIOR treated (n=95) versus 0.8 for placebo treated (n=105) patients (p&lt;0.001). At week 104, the mean change from baseline in the SPARCC score measured on MRI for all LIFMIOR-treated subjects was 4.64 for the SIJ (n=153) and 1.40 the spine (n=154). LIFMIOR showed statistically significantly greater improvement from baseline to week 12 compared to placebo in most health-related quality of life and physical function assessments, including BASFI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index), EuroQol 5D Overall Health State Score and SF-36 Physical Component Score. Clinical responses among nr-AxSpa patients who received LIFMIOR were apparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 2 years of therapy. Improvements in health-related quality of life and physical function were also maintained through 2 years of therapy. The 2 year data did not reveal any new safety findings. At week 104, 8 subjects had progressed to a score of bilateral Grade 2 on spinal X-ray according to the modified New York Radiological Grade, indicative of axial spondyloarthropathy.

## Adult patients with plaque psoriasis

LIFMIOR is recommended for use in patients as defined in section 4.1. Patients who 'failed to respond to' in the target population is defined by insufficient response (PASI&lt;50 or PGA less than good), or worsening of the disease while on treatment, and who were adequately dosed for a sufficiently long duration to assess response with at least each of the three major systemic therapies as available.

The efficacy of LIFMIOR versus other systemic therapies in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis (responsive to other systemic therapies) has not been evaluated in studies directly comparing LIFMIOR with other systemic therapies. Instead, the safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR were assessed in four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The primary efficacy endpoint in all four studies was the proportion of patients in each treatment group who achieved the PASI 75 (i.e., at least a 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score from baseline) at 12 weeks. Study 1 was a Phase 2 study in patients with active, but clinically stable, plaque psoriasis involving ≥ 10% of the body surface area who were ≥ 18 years old. One hundred and twelve (112) patients were randomised to receive a dose of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (n=57) or placebo (n=55) twice a week for 24 weeks. Study 2 evaluated 652 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis using the same inclusion criteria as study 1 with the addition of a minimum psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) of 10 at screening. LIFMIOR was administered at doses of 25 mg once a week, 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg twice a week for 6 consecutive months. During the first 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment period, patients received placebo or one of the above three LIFMIOR doses. After 12 weeks of treatment, patients in the placebo group began treatment with blinded LIFMIOR (25 mg twice a week); patients in the active treatment groups continued to week 24 on the dose to which they were originally randomised. Study 3 evaluated 583 patients and had the same inclusion criteria as study 2. Patients in this study received a dose of 25 mg or 50 mg LIFMIOR, or placebo twice a week for 12 weeks and then all patients received open-label 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly for an additional 24 weeks. Study 4 evaluated 142 patients and had similar inclusion criteria to studies 2 and 3. Patients in this study received a dose of 50 mg LIFMIOR or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks and then all patients received open-label 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly for an additional 12 weeks. In study 1, the LIFMIOR-treated group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a PASI 75 response at week 12 (30%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p&lt;0.0001). At 24 weeks, 56% of patients in the LIFMIOR-treated group had achieved the PASI 75 compared to 5% of placebo-treated patients. Key results of studies 2, 3 and 4 are shown below.

## Responses of Patients with Psoriasis in Studies 2, 3 and 4

*p ≤ 0.0001 compared with placebo a. No statistical comparisons to placebo were made at week 24 in studies 2 and 4 because the original placebo group began receiving LIFMIOR 25 mg BIW or 50 mg once weekly from week 13 to week 24. b. Dermatologist Static Global Assessment. Clear or almost clear defined as 0 or 1 on a 0 to 5 scale. Among patients with plaque psoriasis who received LIFMIOR, significant responses relative to placebo were apparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 24 weeks of therapy. Study 2 also had a drug withdrawal period during which patients who achieved a PASI improvement of at least 50% at week 24 had treatment stopped. Patients were observed off treatment for the occurrence of rebound (PASI ≥ 150% of baseline) and for the time to relapse (defined as a loss of at least half of the improvement achieved between baseline and week 24). During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis gradually returned, with a median time to disease relapse of 3 months. No rebound flare of disease and no psoriasis-related serious adverse events were observed. There was some evidence to support a benefit of re-treatment with LIFMIOR in patients initially responding to treatment. In study 3, the majority of patients (77%) who were initially randomised to 50 mg twice weekly and had their LIFMIOR dose decreased at week 12 to 25 mg twice weekly maintained their PASI 75 response through week 36. For patients who received 25 mg twice weekly throughout the study, the PASI 75 response continued to improve between weeks 12 and 36. In study 4, the LIFMIOR-treated group had a higher proportion of patients with PASI 75 at week 12 (38%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p&lt;0.0001). For patients who received 50 mg once weekly throughout the study, the efficacy responses continued to improve with 71% achieving PASI 75 at week 24. In long-term (up to 34 months) open-label studies where LIFMIOR was given without interruption, clinical responses were sustained and safety was comparable to shorter-term studies. An analysis of clinical trial data did not reveal any baseline disease characteristics that would assist clinicians in selecting the most appropriate dosing option (intermittent or continuous). Consequently, the choice of intermittent or continuous therapy should be based upon physician judgment and individual patient needs. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Antibodies to LIFMIOR

Antibodies to etanercept have been detected in the sera of some subjects treated with etanercept. These antibodies have all been non-neutralising and are generally transient. There appears to be no correlation between antibody development and clinical response or adverse events.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In subjects treated with approved doses of etanercept in clinical trials for up to 12 months, cumulative rates of anti-etanercept antibodies were approximately 6% of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, 7.5% of subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 2% of subjects with ankylosing spondylitis, 7% of subjects with psoriasis, 9.7% of subjects with paediatric psoriasis, and 4.8% of subjects with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

The proportion of subjects who developed antibodies to etanercept in longer-term trials (of up to 3.5 years) increases over time, as expected. However, due to their transient nature, the incidence of antibodies detected at each assessment point was typically less than 7% in rheumatoid arthritis subjects and psoriasis subjects. In a long-term psoriasis study in which patients received 50 mg twice weekly for 96 weeks, the incidence of antibodies observed at each assessment point was up to approximately 9%. Paediatric population Paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis The safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR were assessed in a two-part study in 69 children with polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who had a variety of juvenile idiopathic arthritis onset types (polyarthritis, pauciarthritis, systemic onset). Patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderately to severely active polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis refractory to, or intolerant of, methotrexate were enrolled; patients remained on a stable dose of a single nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and/or prednisone (&lt; 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg maximum). In part 1, all patients received 0.4 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg per dose) LIFMIOR subcutaneously twice weekly. In part 2, patients with a clinical response at day 90 were randomised to remain on LIFMIOR or receive placebo for four months and assessed for disease flare. Responses were measured using the ACR Pedi 30 ), defined as ≥ 30% improvement in at least three of six and ≥ 30% worsening in no more than one of six JRA core set criteria, including active joint count, limitation of motion, physician and patient/parent global assessments, functional assessment, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Disease flare was defined as a ≥ 30% worsening in three of six JRA core set criteria and ≥ 30% improvement in not more than one of the six JRA core set criteria and a minimum of two active joints. In part 1 of the study, 51 of 69 (74%) patients demonstrated a clinical response and entered part 2. In part 2, 6 of 25 (24%) patients remaining on LIFMIOR experienced a disease flare compared to 20 of 26 (77%) patients receiving placebo (p=0.007). From the start of part 2, the median time to flare was ≥ 116 days for patients who received LIFMIOR and 28 days for patients who received placebo. Of patients who demonstrated a clinical response at 90 days and entered part 2 of the study, some of the patients remaining on LIFMIOR continued to improve from month 3 through month 7, while those who received placebo did not improve. In an open-label, safety extension study, 58 paediatric patients from the above study (from the age of 4 years at time of enrollment) continued to receive LIFMIOR for up to 10 years. Rates of serious adverse events and serious infections did not increase with long-term exposure. Long-term safety of LIFMIOR monotherapy (n=103), LIFMIOR plus methotrexate (n=294), or methotrexate monotherapy (n=197) were assessed for up to 3 years in a registry of 594 children aged 2 to 18 years with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 39 of whom were 2 to 3 years of age. Overall, infections were more commonly reported in patients treated with etanercept compared to methotrexate alone (3.8 versus 2%), and the infections associated with etanercept use were of a more severe nature.

In another open-label single-arm study, 60 patients with extended oligoarthritis (15 patients aged 2 to 4, 23 patients aged 5 to 11 and 22 patients aged 12 to 17 years old), 38 patients with enthesitis-related arthritis (12 to 17 years old), and 29 patients with psoriatic arthritis (12 to 17 years old) were treated with LIFMIOR at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) administered weekly for 12 weeks. In each of the JIA subtypes, the majority of patients met ACR Pedi 30 criteria and demonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of tender joints and physician global assessment. The safety profile was consistent with that observed in other JIA studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Studies have not been done in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis to assess the effects of continued LIFMIOR therapy in patients who do not respond within 3 months of initiating LIFMIOR therapy. Additionally, studies have not been conducted to assess the effects of discontinuing or reducing the recommended dose of LIFMIOR following its long-term use in patients with JIA.

Absorption

Etanercept is slowly absorbed from the site of subcutaneous injection, reaching maximum concentration approximately 48 hours after a single dose. The absolute bioavailability is 76%. With twice-weekly doses, it is anticipated that steady-state concentrations are approximately twice as high as those observed after single doses. After a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg LIFMIOR, the average maximum serum concentration observed in healthy volunteers was 1.65 ± 0.66 µ g/ml, and the area under the curve was 235 ± 96.6 µ g · hr/ml.

Paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis The efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 211 paediatric patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (as defined by an sPGA score ≥ 3, involving ≥ 10% of the BSA, and PASI ≥ 12). Eligible patients had a history of receiving phototherapy or systemic therapy, or were inadequately controlled on topical therapy. Patients received LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks. At week 12, more patients randomised to LIFMIOR had positive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than those randomised to placebo. Paediatric Plaque Psoriasis Outcomes at 12 Weeks Abbreviation: sPGA-static Physician Global Assessment a. p &lt; 0.0001 compared with placebo After the 12-week double-blind treatment period, all patients received LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) once weekly for additional 24 weeks. Responses observed during the open-label period were similar to those observed in the double-blind period. During a randomised withdrawal period, significantly more patients re-randomised to placebo experienced disease relapse (loss of PASI 75 response) compared with patients re-randomised to LIFMIOR. With continued therapy, responses were maintained up to 48 weeks. The long-term safety and effectiveness of LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) once weekly was assessed in an open-label extension study of 181 paediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis for up to 2 years beyond the 48 week study discussed above. Long-term experience with LIFMIOR was generally comparable to the original 48-week study and did not reveal any new safety findings. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Etanercept serum values were determined by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method, which may detect ELISA-reactive degradation products, as well as the parent compound. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Mean serum concentration profiles at steady state in treated RA patients were C max of 2.4 mg/l vs. 2.6 mg/l, C min of 1.2 mg/l vs. 1.4 mg/l, and partial AUC of 297 mgh/l vs. 316 mgh/l for 50 mg

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

LIFMIOR once weekly (n=21) vs. 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly (n=16), respectively. In an open-label, single-dose, two-treatment, crossover study in healthy volunteers, etanercept administered as a single 50 mg/ml injection was found to be bioequivalent to two simultaneous injections of 25 mg/ml.

In a population pharmacokinetics analysis in ankylosing spondylitis patients, the etanercept steady state AUCs were 466 µ g · hr/ml and 474 µ g · hr/ml for 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly (N= 154) and 25 mg twice weekly (N = 148), respectively.

Distribution A biexponential curve is required to describe the concentration time curve of etanercept. The central volume of distribution of etanercept is 7.6 l, while the volume of distribution at steady-state is 10.4 l. Elimination Etanercept is cleared slowly from the body. The half-life is long, approximately 70 hours. Clearance is approximately 0.066 l/hr in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, somewhat lower than the value of 0.11 l/hr observed in healthy volunteers. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of LIFMIOR in rheumatoid arthritis patients, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis patients are similar. There is no apparent pharmacokinetic difference between males and females. Linearity Dose proportionality has not been formally evaluated, but there is no apparent saturation of clearance across the dosing range. Special populations Renal impairment Although there is elimination of radioactivity in urine after administration of radiolabelled etanercept to patients and volunteers, increased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with acute renal failure. The presence of renal impairment should not require a change in dosage. Hepatic impairment Increased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with acute hepatic failure. The presence of hepatic impairment should not require a change in dosage. Elderly The impact of advanced age was studied in the population pharmacokinetic analysis of etanercept serum concentrations. Clearance and volume estimates in patients aged 65 to 87 years were similar to estimates in patients less than 65 years of age. Paediatric population Paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis In a polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis trial with LIFMIOR, 69 patients (aged 4 to 17 years) were administered 0.4 mg LIFMIOR/kg twice weekly for three months. Serum concentration profiles were similar to those seen in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. The youngest children (4 years of age) had reduced clearance (increased clearance when normalised by weight) compared with older children (12 years of age) and adults. Simulation of dosing suggests that while older children (10-17 years of age) will have serum levels close to those seen in adults, younger children will have appreciably lower levels.

## Paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis

Patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis (aged 4 to 17 years) were administered 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 50 mg per week) of etanercept once weekly for up to 48 weeks. The mean serum steady-state trough concentrations ranged from 1.6 to 2.1 mcg/ml at weeks 12, 24, and 48. These mean concentrations in patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis were similar to the concentrations observed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (treated with 0.4 mg/kg etanercept twice weekly, up to maximum dose of 50 mg per week). These mean concentrations were similar to those seen in adult patients with plaque psoriasis treated with 25 mg etanercept twice-weekly.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

6.4

LIFMIOR may be stored at temperatures up to a maximum of 25 ° C for a single period of up to four weeks; after which, it should not be refrigerated again. LIFMIOR should be discarded if not used within four weeks of removal from refrigeration.

In the toxicological studies with LIFMIOR, no dose-limiting or target organ toxicity was evident. LIFMIOR was considered to be non-genotoxic from a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies. Carcinogenicity studies, and standard assessments of fertility and postnatal toxicity, were not performed with LIFMIOR due to the development of neutralising antibodies in rodents. LIFMIOR did not induce lethality or notable signs of toxicity in mice or rats following a single subcutaneous dose of 2000 mg/kg or a single intravenous dose of 1000 mg/kg. LIFMIOR did not elicit dose-limiting or target organ toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys following twice weekly subcutaneous administration for 4 or 26 consecutive weeks at a dose (15 mg/kg) that resulted in AUC-based serum drug concentrations that were over 27-fold higher than that obtained in humans at the recommended dose of 25 mg. 6.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

LIFMIOR 25 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe. LIFMIOR 50 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe. 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 25 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe Each pre-filled syringe contains 25 mg of etanercept. 50 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe Each pre-filled syringe contains 50 mg of etanercept. Etanercept is a human tumour necrosis factor receptor p75 Fc fusion protein produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian expression system. Etanercept is a dimer of a chimeric protein genetically engineered by fusing the extracellular ligand binding domain of human tumour necrosis factor receptor-2 (TNFR2/p75) to the Fc domain of human IgG1. This Fc component contains the hinge, CH 2 and CH3 regions, but not the CH 1 region of IgG1. Etanercept contains 934 amino acids and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons. The specific activity of etanercept is 1.7 x 10 6 units/mg. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection. The solution is clear, and colourless to pale yellow or pale brown. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rheumatoid arthritis LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including methotrexate (unless contraindicated), has been inadequate. LIFMIOR can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. LIFMIOR is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated with methotrexate. Medicinal product no longer authorised

LIFMIOR, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Juvenile idiopathic arthritis

Treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in children and adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate.

Plaque psoriasis Treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy, including ciclosporin, methotrexate or psoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA) (see section 5.1). Paediatric plaque psoriasis Treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies. 4.2 Posology and method of administration LIFMIOR treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis or paediatric plaque psoriasis. Patients treated with LIFMIOR should be given the Patient Alert Card. LIFMIOR is available in strengths of 10, 25 and 50 mg. Posology Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Rheumatoid arthritis

25 mg LIFMIOR administered twice weekly is the recommended dose. Alternatively, 50 mg administered once weekly has been shown to be safe and effective (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis The recommended dose is 25 mg LIFMIOR administered twice weekly, or 50 mg administered once weekly.

For all of the above indications, available data suggest that a clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.

## Paediatric plaque psoriasis (age 6 years and above)

Plaque psoriasis The recommended dose of LIFMIOR is 25 mg administered twice weekly or 50 mg administered once weekly. Alternatively, 50 mg given twice weekly may be used for up to 12 weeks followed, if necessary, by a dose of 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once weekly. Treatment with LIFMIOR should continue until remission is achieved, for up to 24 weeks. Continuous therapy beyond 24 weeks may be appropriate for some adult patients (see section 5.1). Treatment should be discontinued in patients who show no response after 12 weeks. If re-treatment with LIFMIOR is indicated, the same guidance on treatment duration should be followed. The dose should be 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once weekly. Special populations Renal and hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required. Elderly No dose adjustment is required. Posology and administration are the same as for adults 18-64 years of age. Paediatric population The dosage of LIFMIOR is based on body weight for paediatric patients. Patients weighing less than 62.5 kg should be accurately dosed on a mg/kg basis using the powder and solvent for solution for injection presentations or the powder for solution for injection presentations (see below for dosing for specific indications). Patients weighing 62.5 kg or more, may be dosed using a fixed-dose pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis The recommended dose is 0.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 25 mg per dose), given twice weekly as a subcutaneous injection with an interval of 3-4 days between doses or 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) given once weekly. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered in patients who show no response after 4 months. The 10 mg vial strength may be more appropriate for administration to children with JIA below the weight of 25 kg. No formal clinical trials have been conducted in children aged 2 to 3 years. However, limited safety data from a patient registry suggest that the safety profile in children from 2 to 3 years of age is similar to that seen in adults and children aged 4 years and older, when dosed every week with 0.8 mg/kg subcutaneously (see section 5.1). There is generally no applicable use of LIFMIOR in children aged below 2 years in the indication juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The recommended dose is 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly for up to 24 weeks. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who show no response after 12 weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If re-treatment with LIFMIOR is indicated, the above guidance on treatment duration should be followed. The dose should be 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly.

There is generally no applicable use of LIFMIOR in children aged below 6 years in the indication plaque psoriasis.

Method of administration LIFMIOR is administered by subcutaneous injection (see section 6.6). Comprehensive instructions for administration are given in the package leaflet, section 7, \"Instructions for preparation and giving an injection of LIFMIOR'. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Sepsis or risk of sepsis. Treatment with LIFMIOR should not be initiated in patients with active infections, including chronic or localised infections. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trademark and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. Infections Patients should be evaluated for infections before, during, and after treatment with LIFMIOR, taking into consideration that the mean elimination half-life of etanercept is approximately 70 hours (range 7 to 300 hours). Serious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis, and opportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections, listeriosis and legionellosis, have been reported with the use of LIFMIOR (see section 4.8). These infections were due to bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites (including protozoa). In some cases, particular fungal and other opportunistic infections have not been recognised, resulting in delay of appropriate treatment and sometimes death. In evaluating patients for infections, the patient's risk for relevant opportunistic infections (e.g., exposure to endemic mycoses) should be considered. Patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with LIFMIOR should be monitored closely. Administration of LIFMIOR should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. The safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with chronic infections have not been evaluated. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of LIFMIOR in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions that may predispose patients to infections, such as advanced or poorly controlled diabetes. Tuberculosis Cases of active tuberculosis, including miliary tuberculosis and tuberculosis with extra-pulmonary location, have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Before starting treatment with LIFMIOR, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive ('latent') tuberculosis. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with personal history of tuberculosis or possible previous contact with tuberculosis and previous and/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests, i.e., tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the conduct of these tests should be recorded in the patient's alert card. Prescribers are reminded of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised.

If active tuberculosis is diagnosed, LIFMIOR therapy must not be initiated. If inactive ('latent') tuberculosis is diagnosed, treatment for latent tuberculosis must be started with anti-tuberculosis therapy before the initiation of LIFMIOR, and in accordance with local recommendations. In this situation, the benefit/risk balance of LIFMIOR therapy should be very carefully considered.

The possibility exists for TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR, to affect host defences against infections and malignancies since TNF mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune responses. In a study of 49 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with LIFMIOR, there was no evidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in enumeration of effector cell populations.

All patients should be informed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low-grade fever) appear during or after LIFMIOR treatment. Hepatitis B reactivation Reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were previously infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and had received concomitant TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR, has been reported. This includes reports of reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were anti-HBc positive but HBsAg negative. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with LIFMIOR. For patients who test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. Caution should be exercised when administering LIFMIOR in patients previously infected with HBV. These patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several weeks following termination of therapy. Adequate data from treating patients infected with HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy are not available. In patients who develop HBV infection, LIFMIOR should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. Worsening of hepatitis C There have been reports of worsening of hepatitis C in patients receiving LIFMIOR. LIFMIOR should be used with caution in patients with a history of hepatitis C. Concurrent treatment with anakinra Concurrent administration of LIFMIOR and anakinra has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections and neutropenia compared to LIFMIOR alone. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit. Thus, the combined use of LIFMIOR and anakinra is not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). Concurrent treatment with abatacept In clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and LIFMIOR resulted in increased incidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.5). Allergic reactions The needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains latex (dry natural rubber) that may cause hypersensitivity reactions when handled by, or when LIFMIOR is administered to, persons with known or possible latex sensitivity. Allergic reactions associated with LIFMIOR administration have been reported commonly. Allergic reactions have included angioedema and urticaria; serious reactions have occurred. If any serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, LIFMIOR therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. Immunosuppression Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients developed varicella infection and signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae. Patients with a significant exposure to varicella virus should temporarily discontinue LIFMIOR therapy and be considered for prophylactic treatment with Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin.

The safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with immunosuppression have not been evaluated.

Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders Solid and haematopoietic malignancies (excluding skin cancers) Reports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have been received in the postmarketing period (see section 4.8). In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. However, the occurrence was rare, and the follow-up period of placebo patients was shorter than for patients receiving TNF-antagonist therapy. In the postmarketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, which complicates risk estimation. Based on current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia or other haematopoietic or solid malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. Caution should be exercised when considering TNF-antagonist therapy for patients with a history of malignancy or when considering continuing treatment in patients who develop a malignancy. Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to 22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including LIFMIOR, in the postmarketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies typically associated with immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. Skin cancers Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) have been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR. Postmarketing cases of Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported very infrequently in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Periodic skin examination is recommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer. Combining the results of controlled clinical trials, more cases of NMSC were observed in patients receiving LIFMIOR compared with control patients, particularly in patients with psoriasis. Vaccinations Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with LIFMIOR. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving LIFMIOR. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical study in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis, 184 patients also received a multivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at week 4. In this study, most psoriatic arthritis patients receiving LIFMIOR were able to mount effective B-cell immune response to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, but titres in aggregate were moderately lower, and few patients had two-fold rises in titres compared to patients not receiving LIFMIOR. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Autoantibody formation

Treatment with LIFMIOR may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies (see section 4.8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Haematologic reactions

Rare cases of pancytopenia and very rare cases of aplastic anaemia, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Caution should be exercised in patients being treated with LIFMIOR who have a previous history of blood dyscrasias. All patients and parents/caregivers should be advised that if the patient develops signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infections (e.g., persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding, paleness) whilst on LIFMIOR, they should seek immediate medical advice. Such patients should be investigated urgently, including full blood count; if blood dyscrasias are confirmed, LIFMIOR should be discontinued.

Neurological disorders There have been rare reports of CNS demyelinating disorders in patients treated with LIFMIOR (see section 4.8). Additionally, there have been rare reports of peripheral demyelinating polyneuropathies (including Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy). Although no clinical trials have been performed evaluating LIFMIOR therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis, clinical trials of other TNF antagonists in patients with multiple sclerosis have shown increases in disease activity. A careful risk/benefit evaluation, including a neurologic assessment, is recommended when prescribing LIFMIOR to patients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating disease, or to those who are considered to have an increased risk of developing demyelinating disease. Combination therapy In a controlled clinical trial of two years duration in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the combination of LIFMIOR and methotrexate did not result in unexpected safety findings, and the safety profile of LIFMIOR when given in combination with methotrexate was similar to the profiles reported in studies of LIFMIOR and methotrexate alone. Long-term studies to assess the safety of the combination are ongoing. The long-term safety of LIFMIOR in combination with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) has not been established. The use of LIFMIOR in combination with other systemic therapies or phototherapy for the treatment of psoriasis has not been studied. Renal and hepatic impairment Based on pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2), no dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal or hepatic impairment; clinical experience in such patients is limited. Congestive heart failure (Cardiac failure congestive) Physicians should use caution when using LIFMIOR in patients who have congestive heart failure (CHF). There have been postmarketing reports of worsening of CHF, with and without identifiable precipitating factors, in patients taking LIFMIOR. There have also been rare (&lt; 0.1%) reports of new onset CHF, including CHF in patients without known pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Some of these patients have been under 50 years of age. Two large clinical trials evaluating the use of LIFMIOR in the treatment of CHF were terminated early due to lack of efficacy. Although not conclusive, data from one of these trials suggest a possible tendency toward worsening CHF in those patients assigned to LIFMIOR treatment. Alcoholic hepatitis In a phase II randomised placebo-controlled study of 48 hospitalised patients treated with LIFMIOR or placebo for moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis, LIFMIOR was not efficacious, and the mortality rate in patients treated with LIFMIOR was significantly higher after 6 months. Consequently, LIFMIOR should not be used in patients for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. Physicians should use caution when using LIFMIOR in patients who also have moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Wegener's granulomatosis

A placebo-controlled trial, in which 89 adult patients were treated with LIFMIOR in addition to standard therapy (including cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, and glucocorticoids) for a median duration of 25 months, has not shown LIFMIOR to be an effective treatment for Wegener's granulomatosis. The incidence of non-cutaneous malignancies of various types was significantly

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR than in the control group. LIFMIOR is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis.

## Hypoglycaemia in patients treated for diabetes

There have been reports of hypoglycaemia following initiation of LIFMIOR in patients receiving medication for diabetes, necessitating a reduction in anti-diabetic medication in some of these patients.

Special populations Elderly In the Phase 3 studies in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, no overall differences in adverse events, serious adverse events, and serious infections in patients age 65 or older who received LIFMIOR were observed compared with younger patients. However, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly and particular attention paid with respect to occurrence of infections. Paediatric population Vaccinations It is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating LIFMIOR therapy (see Vaccinations, above). Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and uveitis in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) There have been reports of IBD and uveitis in JIA patients being treated with LIFMIOR (see section 4.8). 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concurrent treatment with anakinra Adult patients treated with LIFMIOR and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious infection when compared with patients treated with either LIFMIOR or anakinra alone (historical data). In addition, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients receiving background methotrexate, patients treated with LIFMIOR and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with LIFMIOR (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The combination LIFMIOR and anakinra has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit, and is therefore not recommended. Concurrent treatment with abatacept In clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and LIFMIOR resulted in increased incidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.4). Concurrent treatment with sulfasalazine In a clinical study of adult patients who were receiving established doses of sulfasalazine, to which LIFMIOR was added, patients in the combination group experienced a statistically significant decrease in mean white blood cell counts in comparison to groups treated with LIFMIOR or sulfasalazine alone. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Physicians should use caution when considering combination therapy with sulfasalazine. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Non-interactions

In clinical trials, no interactions have been observed when LIFMIOR was administered with glucocorticoids, salicylates (except sulfasalazine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, or methotrexate. See section 4.4 for vaccination advice.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions were observed in studies with methotrexate, digoxin or warfarin.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential should consider the use of appropriate contraception to avoid becoming pregnant during LIFMIOR therapy and for three weeks after discontinuation of therapy. Pregnancy Developmental toxicity studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of harm to the foetus or neonatal rat due to etanercept. The effects of etanercept on pregnancy outcomes have been investigated in two observational cohort studies. A higher rate of major birth defects was observed in one observational study comparing pregnancies exposed to etanercept (n=370) during the first trimester with pregnancies not exposed to etanercept or other TNF-antagonists (n=164) (adjusted odds ratio 2.4, 95% CI: 1.0-5.5). The types of major birth defects were consistent with those most commonly reported in the general population and no particular pattern of abnormalities was identified. No change in the rate of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or minor malformations was observed. In another observational multi-country registry study comparing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to etanercept during the first 90 days of pregnancy (n=425) to those exposed to non-biologic drugs (n=3497), there was no observed increased risk of major birth defects (crude odds ratio [OR]= 1.22, 95% CI: 0.79-1.90; adjusted OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.58-1.60 after adjusting for country, maternal disease, parity, maternal age and smoking in early pregnancy). This study also showed no increased risks of minor birth defects, preterm birth, stillbirth, or infections in the first year of life for infants born to women exposed to etanercept during pregnancy. LIFMIOR should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. Etanercept crosses the placenta and has been detected in the serum of infants born to female patients treated with LIFMIOR during pregnancy. The clinical impact of this is unknown, however, infants may be at increased risk of infection. Administration of live vaccines to infants for 16 weeks after the mother's last dose of LIFMIOR is generally not recommended. Breast-feeding Etanercept has been reported to be excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration. In lactating rats following subcutaneous administration, etanercept was excreted in the milk and detected in the serum of pups. Because immunoglobulins, in common with many medicinal products, can be excreted in human milk, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue LIFMIOR therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. Fertility Preclinical data about peri- and postnatal toxicity of etanercept and of effects of etanercept on fertility and general reproductive performance are not available. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile Medicinal product no longer authorised

The most commonly reported adverse reactions are injection site reactions (such as pain, swelling, itching, reddening and bleeding at the puncture site), infections (such as upper respiratory infections, bronchitis, bladder infections and skin infections), allergic reactions, development of autoantibodies, itching, and fever.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Serious adverse reactions have also been reported for LIFMIOR. TNF-antagonists, such as LIFMIOR, affect the immune system and their use may affect the body's defenses against infection and cancer. Serious infections affect fewer than 1 in 100 patients treated with LIFMIOR. Reports have included fatal and life-threatening infections and sepsis. Various malignancies have also been reported with use of LIFMIOR, including cancers of the breast, lung, skin and lymph glands (lymphoma).

Serious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These include rare reports of pancytopenia and very rare reports of aplastic anaemia. Central and peripheral demyelinating events have been seen rarely and very rarely, respectively, with LIFMIOR use. There have been rare reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions, and vasculitis. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials in adults and on postmarketing experience. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of patients expected to experience the reaction), using the following categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders

One hundred and twenty-nine (129) new malignancies of various types were observed in 4,114 rheumatoid arthritis patients treated in clinical trials with LIFMIOR for up to approximately 6 years,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

including 231 patients treated with LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate in the 2-year active-controlled study. The observed rates and incidences in these clinical trials were similar to those expected for the population studied. A total of 2 malignancies were reported in clinical studies of approximately 2 years duration involving 240 LIFMIOR-treated psoriatic arthritis patients. In clinical studies conducted for more than 2 years with 351 ankylosing spondylitis patients, 6 malignancies were reported in LIFMIOR-treated patients. In a group of 2,711 plaque psoriasis patients treated with LIFMIOR in double-blind and open-label studies of up to 2.5 years, 30 malignancies and 43 nonmelanoma skin cancers were reported.

Serious and fatal infections have been reported during use of LIFMIOR; reported pathogens include bacteria, mycobacteria (including tuberculosis), viruses and fungi. Some have occurred within a few weeks after initiating treatment with LIFMIOR in patients who have underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes, congestive heart failure, history of active or chronic infections) in addition to their rheumatoid arthritis (see section 4.4). LIFMIOR treatment may increase mortality in patients with established sepsis.

In a group of 7,416 patients treated with LIFMIOR in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis clinical trials, 18 lymphomas were reported. Reports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have also been received in the postmarketing period (see section 4.4). Injection site reactions Compared to placebo, patients with rheumatic diseases treated with LIFMIOR had a significantly higher incidence of injection site reactions (36% vs. 9%). Injection site reactions usually occurred in the first month. Mean duration was approximately 3 to 5 days. No treatment was given for the majority of injection site reactions in the LIFMIOR treatment groups, and the majority of patients who were given treatment received topical preparations, such as corticosteroids, or oral antihistamines. Additionally, some patients developed recall injection site reactions characterised by a skin reaction at the most recent site of injection, along with the simultaneous appearance of injection site reactions at previous injection sites. These reactions were generally transient and did not recur with treatment. In controlled trials in patients with plaque psoriasis, approximately 13.6% of patients treated with LIFMIOR developed injection site reactions compared with 3.4% of placebo-treated patients during the first 12 weeks of treatment. Serious infections In placebo-controlled trials, no increase in the incidence of serious infections (fatal, life-threatening, or requiring hospitalisation or intravenous antibiotics) was observed. Serious infections occurred in 6.3% of rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with LIFMIOR for up to 48 months. These included abscess (at various sites), bacteraemia, bronchitis, bursitis, cellulitis, cholecystitis, diarrhoea, diverticulitis, endocarditis (suspected), gastroenteritis, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, leg ulcer, mouth infection, osteomyelitis, otitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, sepsis, septic arthritis, sinusitis, skin infection, skin ulcer, urinary tract infection, vasculitis, and wound infection. In the 2-year active-controlled study where patients were treated with either LIFMIOR alone, methotrexate alone or LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate, the rates of serious infections were similar among the treatment groups. However, it cannot be excluded that the combination of LIFMIOR with methotrexate could be associated with an increase in the rate of infections. There were no differences in rates of infection among patients treated with LIFMIOR and those treated with placebo for plaque psoriasis in placebo-controlled trials of up to 24 weeks duration. Serious infections experienced by LIFMIOR-treated patients included cellulitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, cholecystitis, osteomyelitis, gastritis, appendicitis, Streptococcal fasciitis, myositis, septic shock, diverticulitis and abscess. In the double-blind and open-label psoriatic arthritis trials, 1 patient reported a serious infection (pneumonia). Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Opportunistic infections have been reported in association with LIFMIOR, including invasive fungal, parasitic (including protozoal), viral (including herpes zoster), bacterial (including Listeria and Legionella ), and atypical mycobacterial infections. In a pooled data set of clinical trials, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was 0.09% for the 15,402 subjects who received LIFMIOR. The exposure-adjusted rate was 0.06 events per 100 patient-years. In postmarketing experience, approximately half of all of the case reports of opportunistic infections worldwide were invasive fungal infections. The most commonly reported invasive fungal infections included Candida, Pneumocystis, Aspergillus, and Histoplasma . Invasive fungal infections accounted for more than half of the fatalities amongst patients who developed opportunistic infections. The majority of the reports with a fatal outcome were in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, unspecified systemic fungal infections, and aspergillosis (see section 4.4).

In the double-blind periods of controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.54% (frequency uncommon). In the double-blind periods of controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes was 4.18% (frequency common).

Autoantibodies Adult patients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple timepoints. Of the rheumatoid arthritis patients evaluated for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), the percentage of patients who developed new positive ANA ( ≥ 1:40) was higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR (11%) than in placebotreated patients (5%). The percentage of patients who developed new positive anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies was also higher by radioimmunoassay (15% of patients treated with LIFMIOR compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients) and by Crithidia luciliae assay (3% of patients treated with LIFMIOR compared to none of placebo-treated patients). The proportion of patients treated with LIFMIOR who developed anticardiolipin antibodies was similarly increased compared to placebo-treated patients. The impact of long-term treatment with LIFMIOR on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. There have been rare reports of patients, including rheumatoid factor positive patients, who have developed other autoantibodies in conjunction with a lupus-like syndrome or rashes that are compatible with subacute cutaneous lupus or discoid lupus by clinical presentation and biopsy. Pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia There have been postmarketing reports of pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia, some of which had fatal outcomes (see section 4.4). Interstitial lung disease In controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of interstitial lung disease in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.06% (frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of interstitial lung disease was 0.47% (frequency uncommon). There have been postmarketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of which had fatal outcomes. Concurrent treatment with anakinra In studies when adult patients received concurrent treatment with LIFMIOR plus anakinra, a higher rate of serious infections compared to LIFMIOR alone was observed and 2% of patients (3/139) developed neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1000/mm 3 ). While neutropenic, one patient developed cellulitis that resolved after hospitalisation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). Elevated liver enzymes Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Autoimmune hepatitis

In controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.02%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of autoimmune hepatitis was 0.24% (frequency uncommon).

## Paediatric population

Overdose

Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis In general, the adverse events in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult patients. Differences from adults and other special considerations are discussed in the following paragraphs. The types of infections seen in clinical trials in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients aged 2 to 18 years were generally mild to moderate and consistent with those commonly seen in outpatient paediatric populations. Severe adverse events reported included varicella with signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae (see also section 4.4), appendicitis, gastroenteritis, depression/personality disorder, cutaneous ulcer, oesophagitis/gastritis, group A streptococcal septic shock, type I diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and post-operative wound infection. In one study in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis aged 4 to 17 years, 43 of 69 (62%) children experienced an infection while receiving LIFMIOR during 3 months of the study (part 1, open-label), and the frequency and severity of infections was similar in 58 patients completing 12 months of open-label extension therapy. The types and proportion of adverse events in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients were similar to those seen in trials of LIFMIOR in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and the majority were mild. Several adverse events were reported more commonly in 69 juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients receiving 3 months of LIFMIOR compared to the 349 adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. These included headache (19% of patients, 1.7 events per patient year), nausea (9%, 1.0 event per patient year), abdominal pain (19%, 0.74 events per patient year), and vomiting (13%, 0.74 events per patient year). There were 4 reports of macrophage activation syndrome in juvenile idiopathic arthritis clinical trials. There have been reports of inflammatory bowel disease and uveitis in JIA patients being treated with LIFMIOR from post-marketing sources, including a very small number of cases indicating a positive rechallenge (see section 4.4). Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis In a 48-week study in 211 children aged 4 to 17 years with paediatric plaque psoriasis, the adverse events reported were similar to those seen in previous studies in adults with plaque psoriasis. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed during clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis patients. The highest dose level evaluated has been an intravenous loading dose of 32 mg/m 2 followed by subcutaneous doses of 16 mg/m 2 administered twice weekly. One rheumatoid arthritis patient mistakenly self-administered 62 mg LIFMIOR subcutaneously twice weekly for 3 weeks without experiencing undesirable effects. There is no known antidote to LIFMIOR.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors, ATC code: L04AB01

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a dominant cytokine in the inflammatory process of rheumatoid arthritis. Elevated levels of TNF are also found in the synovium and psoriatic plaques of patients with psoriatic arthritis and in serum and synovial tissue of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. In plaque psoriasis, infiltration by inflammatory cells, including T-cells, leads to increased TNF levels in psoriatic lesions compared with levels in uninvolved skin. Etanercept is a competitive inhibitor of TNF binding to its cell surface receptors, and thereby inhibits the biological activity of TNF. TNF and lymphotoxin are pro-inflammatory cytokines that bind to two distinct cell surface receptors: the 55-kilodalton (p55) and 75-kilodalton (p75) tumour necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Both TNFRs exist naturally in membrane-bound and soluble forms. Soluble TNFRs are thought to regulate TNF biological activity. TNF and lymphotoxin exist predominantly as homotrimers, with their biological activity dependent on cross-linking of cell surface TNFRs. Dimeric soluble receptors, such as etanercept, possess a higher affinity for TNF than monomeric receptors and are considerably more potent competitive inhibitors of TNF binding to its cellular receptors. In addition, use of an immunoglobulin Fc region as a fusion element in the construction of a dimeric receptor imparts a longer serum half-life. Mechanism of action Much of the joint pathology in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and skin pathology in plaque psoriasis is mediated by pro-inflammatory molecules that are linked in a network controlled by TNF. The mechanism of action of etanercept is thought to be its competitive inhibition of TNF binding to cell surface TNFR, preventing TNF-mediated cellular responses by rendering TNF biologically inactive. Etanercept may also modulate biologic responses controlled by additional downstream molecules (e.g., cytokines, adhesion molecules, or proteinases) that are induced or regulated by TNF. Clinical efficacy and safety This section presents data from four randomised controlled trials in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, one study in adults with psoriatic arthritis, one study in adults with ankylosing spondylitis, one study in adults with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, four studies in adults with plaque psoriasis, three studies in juvenile idiopathic arthritis and one study in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. Adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis The efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study evaluated 234 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Doses of 10 mg or 25 mg LIFMIOR or placebo were administered subcutaneously twice a week for 6 consecutive months. The results of this controlled trial were expressed in percentage improvement in rheumatoid arthritis using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria. ACR 20 and 50 responses were higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR at 3 and 6 months than in patients treated with placebo (ACR 20: LIFMIOR 62% and 59%, placebo 23% and 11% at 3 and 6 months, respectively: ACR 50: LIFMIOR 41% and 40%, placebo 8% and 5% at months 3 and 6, respectively; p&lt;0.01 LIFMIOR vs. placebo at all timepoints for both ACR 20 and ACR 50 responses).

Approximately 15% of subjects who received LIFMIOR achieved an ACR 70 response at month 3 and month 6 compared to fewer than 5% of subjects in the placebo arm. Among patients receiving LIFMIOR, the clinical responses generally appeared within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of therapy and nearly always occurred by 3 months. A dose response was seen; results with 10 mg were intermediate between placebo and 25 mg. LIFMIOR was significantly better than placebo in all components of the

ACR criteria, as well as other measures of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity not included in the ACR response criteria, such as morning stiffness. A Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), which included disability, vitality, mental health, general health status, and arthritis-associated health status subdomains, was administered every 3 months during the trial. All subdomains of the HAQ were improved in patients treated with LIFMIOR compared to controls at 3 and 6 months.

After discontinuation of LIFMIOR, symptoms of arthritis generally returned within a month. Re-introduction of treatment with LIFMIOR after discontinuation of up to 24 months resulted in the same magnitudes of responses as patients who received LIFMIOR without interruption of therapy based on results of open-label studies. Continued durable responses have been seen for up to 10 years in open-label extension treatment trials when patients received LIFMIOR without interruption. The efficacy of LIFMIOR was compared to methotrexate in a randomised, active-controlled study with blinded radiographic evaluations as a primary endpoint in 632 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (&lt;3 years duration) who had never received treatment with methotrexate. Doses of 10 mg or 25 mg LIFMIOR were administered subcutaneously (SC) twice a week for up to 24 months. Methotrexate doses were escalated from 7.5 mg/week to a maximum of 20 mg/week over the first 8 weeks of the trial and continued for up to 24 months. Clinical improvement, including onset of action within 2 weeks with LIFMIOR 25 mg, was similar to that seen in the previous trials and was maintained for up to 24 months. At baseline, patients had a moderate degree of disability, with mean HAQ scores of 1.4 to 1.5. Treatment with LIFMIOR 25 mg resulted in substantial improvement at 12 months, with about 44% of patients achieving a normal HAQ score (less than 0.5). This benefit was maintained in Year 2 of this study. In this study, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score. Radiographs of hands/wrists and feet were read at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months. The 10 mg LIFMIOR dose had consistently less effect on structural damage than the 25 mg dose. LIFMIOR 25 mg was significantly superior to methotrexate for erosion scores at both 12 and 24 months. The differences in TSS and JSN were not statistically significant between methotrexate and LIFMIOR 25 mg. The results are shown in the figure below.

In another active-controlled, double-blind, randomised study, clinical efficacy, safety, and radiographic progression in RA patients treated with LIFMIOR alone (25 mg twice weekly), methotrexate alone (7.5 to 20 mg weekly, median dose 20 mg), and the combination of LIFMIOR and methotrexate initiated concurrently were compared in 682 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis of 6 months to 20 years duration (median 5 years) who had a less than satisfactory response to at least 1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) other than methotrexate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients in the LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate therapy group had significantly higher ACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70 responses and improvement for DAS and HAQ scores at both 24 and 52 weeks than patients in either of the single therapy groups (results shown in table below). Significant advantages for LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate compared with LIFMIOR monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months.

The efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 205 patients with psoriatic arthritis. Patients were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active psoriatic arthritis ( ≥ 3 swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender joints) in at least one of the following forms: (1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement; (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of psoriasis); (3) arthritis mutilans; (4) asymmetric psoriatic arthritis; or (5) spondylitis-like ankylosis. Patients also had plaque psoriasis with a qualifying target lesion ≥ 2 cm in diameter. Patients had previously been treated with NSAIDs (86%), DMARDs (80%), and corticosteroids (24%). Patients currently on methotrexate therapy (stable for ≥ 2 months) could

Significant advantages for LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate compared with LIFMIOR monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months. Similarly, the significant advantages for LIFMIOR monotherapy compared with methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months. In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were considered to have progressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change ≤ 0.5) at 24 months was higher in the LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate group compared with the LIFMIOR alone and methotrexate alone groups (62%, 50%, and 36%, respectively; p&lt;0.05). The difference between LIFMIOR alone and methotrexate alone was also significant (p&lt;0.05). Among patients who completed a full 24 months of therapy in the study, the non-progression rates were 78%, 70%, and 61%, respectively. The safety and efficacy of 50 mg LIFMIOR (two 25 mg SC injections) administered once weekly were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 420 patients with active RA. In this study, 53 patients received placebo, 214 patients received 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly and 153 patients received 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly. The safety and efficacy profiles of the two LIFMIOR treatment regimens were comparable at week 8 in their effect on signs and symptoms of RA; data at week 16 did not show comparability (non-inferiority) between the two regimens. A single 50 mg/ml injection of LIFMIOR was found to be bioequivalent to two simultaneous injections of 25 mg/ml. Adult patients with psoriatic arthritis Medicinal product no longer authorised

continue at a stable dose of ≤ 25 mg/week methotrexate. Doses of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (based on dose-finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered SC twice a week for 6 months. At the end of the double-blind study, patients could enter a long-term open-label extension study for a total duration of up to 2 years.

Clinical responses were expressed as percentages of patients achieving the ACR 20, 50, and 70 response and percentages with improvement in Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC). Results are summarised in the table below.

LIFMIOR was significantly better than placebo in all measures of disease activity (p &lt; 0.001), and responses were similar with and without concomitant methotrexate therapy. Quality of life in psoriatic arthritis patients was assessed at every timepoint using the disability index of the HAQ. The disability index score was significantly improved at all timepoints in psoriatic arthritis patients treated with LIFMIOR, relative to placebo (p &lt; 0.001). Radiographic changes were assessed in the psoriatic arthritis study. Radiographs of hands and wrists were obtained at baseline and months 6, 12, and 24. The modified TSS at 12 months is presented in the table below. In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were considered to have progressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change ≤ 0.5) at 12 months was higher in the LIFMIOR group compared with the placebo group (73% vs. 47%, respectively, p ≤ 0.001). The effect of LIFMIOR on radiographic progression was maintained in patients who continued on treatment during the second year. The slowing of peripheral joint damage was observed in patients with polyarticular symmetrical joint involvement. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Mean (SE) Annualized Change from Baseline in Total Sharp Score

SE = standard error. a. p = 0.0001. LIFMIOR treatment resulted in improvement in physical function during the double-blind period, and this benefit was maintained during the longer-term exposure of up to 2 years. There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with ankylosing spondylitis-like and arthritis mutilans psoriatic arthropathies due to the small number of patients studied. No study has been performed in patients with psoriatic arthritis using the 50 mg once-weekly dosing regimen. Evidence of efficacy for the once-weekly dosing regimen in this patient population has been based on data from the study in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis The efficacy of LIFMIOR in ankylosing spondylitis was assessed in 3 randomised, double-blind studies comparing twice-weekly administration of 25 mg LIFMIOR with placebo. A total of 401 patients were enrolled, from which 203 were treated with LIFMIOR. The largest of these trials (n= 277) enrolled patients who were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active ankylosing spondylitis defined as visual analog scale (VAS) scores of ≥ 30 for average of duration and intensity of morning stiffness plus VAS scores of ≥ 30 for at least 2 of the following 3 parameters: patient global assessment; average of VAS values for nocturnal back pain and total back pain; average of 10 questions on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). Patients receiving DMARDs, NSAIDS, or corticosteroids could continue them on stable doses. Patients with complete ankylosis of the spine were not included in the study. Doses of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (based on dose-finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered subcutaneously twice a week for 6 months in 138 patients. The primary measure of efficacy (ASAS 20) was a ≥ 20% improvement in at least 3 of the 4 Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) domains (patient global assessments, back pain, BASFI, and inflammation) and absence of deterioration in the remaining domain. ASAS 50 and 70 responses used the same criteria with a 50% improvement or a 70% improvement, respectively. Compared to placebo, treatment with LIFMIOR resulted in significant improvements in the ASAS 20, ASAS 50 and ASAS 70 as early as 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy.

## Responses of Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis in a Placebo-controlled Trial

a: p &lt;0.001, LIFMIOR vs. placebo b: p = 0.002, LIFMIOR vs. placebo Among patients with ankylosing spondylitis who received LIFMIOR, the clinical responses were apparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 6 months of therapy. Responses were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant therapies at baseline. Similar results were obtained in the 2 smaller ankylosing spondylitis trials. In a fourth study, the safety and efficacy of 50 mg LIFMIOR (two 25 mg SC injections) administered once weekly vs. 25 mg LIFMIOR administered twice weekly were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 356 patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. The safety and efficacy profiles of the 50 mg once-weekly and 25 mg twice-weekly regimens were similar. Adult patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis The efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpa) was assessed in a randomised, 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study evaluated 215 adult patients (modified intent-to-treat population) with active nr-AxSpa (18 to 49 years of age), defined as those patients meeting the ASAS classification criteria of axial spondyloarthritis but did not meet the modified New York criteria for AS. Patients were also required to have an inadequate response or intolerance to two or more NSAIDs. In the double-blind period, patients received LIFMIOR 50 mg weekly or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary measure of efficacy (ASAS 40) was a 40% improvement in at least three of the four ASAS domains and absence of deterioration in the remaining domain. The double-blind period was followed by an open-label period during which all patients receive LIFMIOR 50 mg weekly for up to an additional 92 weeks. MRIs of the sacroiliac joint and spine were obtained to assess inflammation at baseline and at weeks 12 and 104. Compared to placebo, treatment with LIFMIOR resulted in statistically significant improvement in the ASAS 40, ASAS 20 and ASAS 5/6. Significant improvement was also observed for the ASAS partial remission and BASDAI 50. Week 12 results are shown in the table below. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Efficacy Response in Placebo-Controlled nr-AxSpa Study: Percent of Patients Achieving Endpoints

*Some patients did not provide complete data for each endpoint **ASAS=Assessments in Spondyloarthritis International Society ***Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index a: p &lt;0.001, b:&lt;0.01 and c:&lt;0.05, respectively between LIFMIOR and placebo At week 12, there was a statistically significant improvement in the SPARCC (Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada) score for the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) as measured by MRI for patients receiving LIFMIOR. Adjusted mean change from baseline was 3.8 for LIFMIOR treated (n=95) versus 0.8 for placebo treated (n=105) patients (p&lt;0.001). At week 104, the mean change from baseline in the SPARCC score measured on MRI for all LIFMIOR-treated subjects was 4.64 for the SIJ (n=153) and 1.40 the spine (n=154). LIFMIOR showed statistically significantly greater improvement from baseline to week 12 compared to placebo in most health-related quality of life and physical function assessments, including BASFI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index), EuroQol 5D Overall Health State Score and SF-36 Physical Component Score. Clinical responses among nr-AxSpa patients who received LIFMIOR were apparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 2 years of therapy. Improvements in health-related quality of life and physical function were also maintained through 2 years of therapy. The 2 year data did not reveal any new safety findings. At week 104, 8 subjects had progressed to a score of bilateral Grade 2 on spinal X-ray according to the modified New York Radiological Grade, indicative of axial spondyloarthropathy. Adult patients with plaque psoriasis LIFMIOR is recommended for use in patients as defined in section 4.1. Patients who 'failed to respond to' in the target population is defined by insufficient response (PASI&lt;50 or PGA less than good), or worsening of the disease while on treatment, and who were adequately dosed for a sufficiently long duration to assess response with at least each of the three major systemic therapies as available. The efficacy of LIFMIOR versus other systemic therapies in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis (responsive to other systemic therapies) has not been evaluated in studies directly comparing LIFMIOR with other systemic therapies. Instead, the safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR were assessed in four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The primary efficacy endpoint in all four studies was the proportion of patients in each treatment group who achieved the PASI 75 (i.e., at least a 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score from baseline) at 12 weeks. Study 1 was a Phase 2 study in patients with active, but clinically stable, plaque psoriasis involving ≥ 10% of the body surface area who were ≥ 18 years old. One hundred and twelve (112) patients were randomised to receive a dose of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (n=57) or placebo (n=55) twice a week for 24 weeks. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Study 2 evaluated 652 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis using the same inclusion criteria as study 1 with the addition of a minimum psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) of 10 at screening. LIFMIOR was administered at doses of 25 mg once a week, 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg twice a week for 6 consecutive months. During the first 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment period, patients received placebo or one of the above three LIFMIOR doses. After 12 weeks of treatment,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients in the placebo group began treatment with blinded LIFMIOR (25 mg twice a week); patients in the active treatment groups continued to week 24 on the dose to which they were originally randomised.

Study 3 evaluated 583 patients and had the same inclusion criteria as study 2. Patients in this study received a dose of 25 mg or 50 mg LIFMIOR, or placebo twice a week for 12 weeks and then all patients received open-label 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly for an additional 24 weeks.

In study 3, the majority of patients (77%) who were initially randomised to 50 mg twice weekly and had their LIFMIOR dose decreased at week 12 to 25 mg twice weekly maintained their PASI 75 response through week 36. For patients who received 25 mg twice weekly throughout the study, the PASI 75 response continued to improve between weeks 12 and 36.

Study 4 evaluated 142 patients and had similar inclusion criteria to studies 2 and 3. Patients in this study received a dose of 50 mg LIFMIOR or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks and then all patients received open-label 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly for an additional 12 weeks. In study 1, the LIFMIOR-treated group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a PASI 75 response at week 12 (30%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p&lt;0.0001). At 24 weeks, 56% of patients in the LIFMIOR-treated group had achieved the PASI 75 compared to 5% of placebo-treated patients. Key results of studies 2, 3 and 4 are shown below. Responses of Patients with Psoriasis in Studies 2, 3 and 4 *p ≤ 0.0001 compared with placebo a.

Dermatologist Static Global Assessment. Clear or almost clear defined as 0 or 1 on a 0 to 5 scale. Among patients with plaque psoriasis who received LIFMIOR, significant responses relative to placebo were apparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 24 weeks of therapy. Study 2 also had a drug withdrawal period during which patients who achieved a PASI improvement of at least 50% at week 24 had treatment stopped. Patients were observed off treatment for the occurrence of rebound (PASI ≥ 150% of baseline) and for the time to relapse (defined as a loss of at least half of the improvement achieved between baseline and week 24). During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis gradually returned, with a median time to disease relapse of 3 months. No rebound flare of disease and no psoriasis-related serious adverse events were observed. There was some evidence to support a benefit of re-treatment with LIFMIOR in patients initially responding to treatment. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In study 4, the LIFMIOR-treated group had a higher proportion of patients with PASI 75 at week 12 (38%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p&lt;0.0001). For patients who received 50 mg once weekly throughout the study, the efficacy responses continued to improve with 71% achieving PASI 75 at week 24.

In long-term (up to 34 months) open-label studies where LIFMIOR was given without interruption, clinical responses were sustained and safety was comparable to shorter-term studies.

In part 1 of the study, 51 of 69 (74%) patients demonstrated a clinical response and entered part 2. In part 2, 6 of 25 (24%) patients remaining on LIFMIOR experienced a disease flare compared to 20 of 26 (77%) patients receiving placebo (p=0.007). From the start of part 2, the median time to flare was ≥ 116 days for patients who received LIFMIOR and 28 days for patients who received placebo. Of patients who demonstrated a clinical response at 90 days and entered part 2 of the study, some of the patients remaining on LIFMIOR continued to improve from month 3 through month 7, while those who received placebo did not improve.

An analysis of clinical trial data did not reveal any baseline disease characteristics that would assist clinicians in selecting the most appropriate dosing option (intermittent or continuous). Consequently, the choice of intermittent or continuous therapy should be based upon physician judgment and individual patient needs. Antibodies to LIFMIOR Antibodies to etanercept have been detected in the sera of some subjects treated with etanercept. These antibodies have all been non-neutralising and are generally transient. There appears to be no correlation between antibody development and clinical response or adverse events. In subjects treated with approved doses of etanercept in clinical trials for up to 12 months, cumulative rates of anti-etanercept antibodies were approximately 6% of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, 7.5% of subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 2% of subjects with ankylosing spondylitis, 7% of subjects with psoriasis, 9.7% of subjects with paediatric psoriasis, and 4.8% of subjects with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The proportion of subjects who developed antibodies to etanercept in longer-term trials (of up to 3.5 years) increases over time, as expected. However, due to their transient nature, the incidence of antibodies detected at each assessment point was typically less than 7% in rheumatoid arthritis subjects and psoriasis subjects. In a long-term psoriasis study in which patients received 50 mg twice weekly for 96 weeks, the incidence of antibodies observed at each assessment point was up to approximately 9%. Paediatric population Paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis The safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR were assessed in a two-part study in 69 children with polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who had a variety of juvenile idiopathic arthritis onset types (polyarthritis, pauciarthritis, systemic onset). Patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderately to severely active polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis refractory to, or intolerant of, methotrexate were enrolled; patients remained on a stable dose of a single nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and/or prednisone (&lt; 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg maximum). In part 1, all patients received 0.4 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg per dose) LIFMIOR subcutaneously twice weekly. In part 2, patients with a clinical response at day 90 were randomised to remain on LIFMIOR or receive placebo for four months and assessed for disease flare. Responses were measured using the ACR Pedi 30, defined as ≥ 30% improvement in at least three of six and ≥ 30% worsening in no more than one of six JRA core set criteria, including active joint count, limitation of motion, physician and patient/parent global assessments, functional assessment, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Disease flare was defined as a ≥ 30% worsening in three of six JRA core set criteria and ≥ 30% improvement in not more than one of the six JRA core set criteria and a minimum of two active joints.

In an open-label, safety extension study, 58 paediatric patients from the above study (from the age of 4 years at time of enrolment) continued to receive LIFMIOR for up to 10 years. Rates of serious adverse events and serious infections did not increase with long-term exposure.

Long-term safety of LIFMIOR monotherapy (n=103), LIFMIOR plus methotrexate (n=294), or methotrexate monotherapy (n=197) were assessed for up to 3 years in a registry of 594 children aged 2 to 18 years with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 39 of whom were 2 to 3 years of age. Overall, infections were more commonly reported in patients treated with etanercept compared to methotrexate alone (3.8 versus 2%), and the infections associated with etanercept use were of a more severe nature.

During a randomised withdrawal period, significantly more patients re-randomised to placebo experienced disease relapse (loss of PASI 75 response) compared with patients re-randomised to LIFMIOR. With continued therapy, responses were maintained up to 48 weeks.

In another open-label single-arm study, 60 patients with extended oligoarthritis (15 patients aged 2 to 4, 23 patients aged 5 to 11 and 22 patients aged 12 to 17 years old), 38 patients with enthesitis-related arthritis (12 to 17 years old), and 29 patients with psoriatic arthritis (12 to 17 years old) were treated with LIFMIOR at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) administered weekly for 12 weeks. In each of the JIA subtypes, the majority of patients met ACR Pedi 30 criteria and demonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of tender joints and physician global assessment. The safety profile was consistent with that observed in other JIA studies. Studies have not been done in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis to assess the effects of continued LIFMIOR therapy in patients who do not respond within 3 months of initiating LIFMIOR therapy. Additionally, studies have not been conducted to assess the effects of discontinuing or reducing the recommended dose of LIFMIOR following its long-term use in patients with JIA. Paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis The efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 211 paediatric patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (as defined by an sPGA score ≥ 3, involving ≥ 10% of the BSA, and PASI ≥ 12). Eligible patients had a history of receiving phototherapy or systemic therapy, or were inadequately controlled on topical therapy. Patients received LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks. At week 12, more patients randomised to LIFMIOR had positive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than those randomised to placebo.

The long-term safety and effectiveness of LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) once weekly was assessed in an open-label extension study of 181 paediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis for up to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2 years beyond the 48 week study discussed above. Long-term experience with LIFMIOR was generally comparable to the original 48-week study and did not reveal any new safety findings.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Etanercept serum values were determined by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method, which may detect ELISA-reactive degradation products, as well as the parent compound.

Special populations

Increased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with acute hepatic failure. The presence of hepatic impairment should not require a change in dosage.

Absorption Etanercept is slowly absorbed from the site of subcutaneous injection, reaching maximum concentration approximately 48 hours after a single dose. The absolute bioavailability is 76%. With twice-weekly doses, it is anticipated that steady-state concentrations are approximately twice as high as those observed after single doses. After a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg LIFMIOR, the average maximum serum concentration observed in healthy volunteers was 1.65 ± 0.66 µ g/ml, and the area under the curve was 235 ± 96.6 µ g · hr/ml. Mean serum concentration profiles at steady state in treated RA patients were C max of 2.4 mg/l vs. 2.6 mg/l, C min of 1.2 mg/l vs. 1.4 mg/l, and partial AUC of 297 mgh/l vs. 316 mgh/l for 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly (n=21) vs. 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly (n=16), respectively. In an open-label, single-dose, two-treatment, crossover study in healthy volunteers, etanercept administered as a single 50 mg/ml injection was found to be bioequivalent to two simultaneous injections of 25 mg/ml. In a population pharmacokinetics analysis in ankylosing spondylitis patients, the etanercept steady state AUCs were 466 µ g · hr/ml and 474 µ g · hr/ml for 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly (N = 154) and 25 mg twice weekly (N = 148), respectively. Distribution A biexponential curve is required to describe the concentration time curve of etanercept. The central volume of distribution of etanercept is 7.6 l, while the volume of distribution at steady-state is 10.4 l. Elimination Etanercept is cleared slowly from the body. The half-life is long, approximately 70 hours. Clearance is approximately 0.066 l/hr in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, somewhat lower than the value of 0.11 l/hr observed in healthy volunteers. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of LIFMIOR in rheumatoid arthritis patients, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis patients are similar. There is no apparent pharmacokinetic difference between males and females. Linearity Dose proportionality has not been formally evaluated, but there is no apparent saturation of clearance across the dosing range. Renal impairment Although there is elimination of radioactivity in urine after administration of radiolabelled etanercept to patients and volunteers, increased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with acute renal failure. The presence of renal impairment should not require a change in dosage. Hepatic impairment Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elderly

The impact of advanced age was studied in the population pharmacokinetic analysis of etanercept serum concentrations. Clearance and volume estimates in patients aged 65 to 87 years were similar to estimates in patients less than 65 years of age.

PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS

6.1

Paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis In a polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis trial with LIFMIOR, 69 patients (aged 4 to 17 years) were administered 0.4 mg LIFMIOR/kg twice weekly for three months. Serum concentration profiles were similar to those seen in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. The youngest children (4 years of age) had reduced clearance (increased clearance when normalised by weight) compared with older children (12 years of age) and adults. Simulation of dosing suggests that while older children (10-17 years of age) will have serum levels close to those seen in adults, younger children will have appreciably lower levels. Paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis Patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis (aged 4 to 17 years) were administered 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 50 mg per week) of etanercept once weekly for up to 48 weeks. The mean serum steady-state trough concentrations ranged from 1.6 to 2.1 mcg/ml at weeks 12, 24, and 48. These mean concentrations in patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis were similar to the concentrations observed in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (treated with 0.4 mg/kg etanercept twice weekly, up to maximum dose of 50 mg per week). These mean concentrations were similar to those seen in adult patients with plaque psoriasis treated with 25 mg etanercept twice-weekly. 5.3 Preclinical safety data In the toxicological studies with LIFMIOR, no dose-limiting or target organ toxicity was evident. LIFMIOR was considered to be non-genotoxic from a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies. Carcinogenicity studies, and standard assessments of fertility and postnatal toxicity, were not performed with LIFMIOR due to the development of neutralising antibodies in rodents. LIFMIOR did not induce lethality or notable signs of toxicity in mice or rats following a single subcutaneous dose of 2000 mg/kg or a single intravenous dose of 1000 mg/kg. LIFMIOR did not elicit dose-limiting or target organ toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys following twice weekly subcutaneous administration for 4 or 26 consecutive weeks at a dose (15 mg/kg) that resulted in AUC-based serum drug concentrations that were over 27-fold higher than that obtained in humans at the recommended dose of 25 mg.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

<!-- image -->

Treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in children and adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate.

LIFMIOR 50 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen. 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each pre-filled pen contains 50 mg of etanercept. Etanercept is a human tumour necrosis factor receptor p75 Fc fusion protein produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian expression system. Etanercept is a dimer of a chimeric protein genetically engineered by fusing the extracellular ligand binding domain of human tumour necrosis factor receptor-2 (TNFR2/p75) to the Fc domain of human IgG1. This Fc component contains the hinge, CH 2 and CH3 regions, but not the CH 1 region of IgG1. Etanercept contains 934 amino acids and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons. The specific activity of etanercept is 1.7 x 10 6 units/mg. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection. The solution is clear, and colourless to pale yellow or pale brown. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rheumatoid arthritis LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including methotrexate (unless contraindicated), has been inadequate. LIFMIOR can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. LIFMIOR is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated with methotrexate. LIFMIOR, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis Medicinal product no longer authorised

Treatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy.

LIFMIOR has not been studied in children aged less than 2 years.

Posology

Psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis The recommended dose is 25 mg LIFMIOR administered twice weekly, or 50 mg administered once weekly.

Psoriatic arthritis Treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. LIFMIOR has been shown to improve physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease. Axial spondyloarthritis Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) Treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis Treatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence, who have had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Plaque psoriasis Treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy including ciclosporin, methotrexate or psoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA) (see section 5.1). Paediatric plaque psoriasis Treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies. 4.2 Posology and method of administration LIFMIOR treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis or paediatric plaque psoriasis. Patients treated with LIFMIOR should be given the Patient Alert Card. The LIFMIOR pre-filled pen is available in a 50 mg strength. Other presentations of LIFMIOR are available in strengths of 10 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg. Rheumatoid arthritis 25 mg LIFMIOR administered twice weekly is the recommended dose. Alternatively, 50 mg administered once weekly has been shown to be safe and effective (see section 5.1). Medicinal product no longer authorised

For all of the above indications, available data suggest that a clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Plaque psoriasis

The recommended dose of LIFMIOR is 25 mg administered twice weekly or 50 mg administered once weekly. Alternatively, 50 mg given twice weekly may be used for up to 12 weeks followed, if necessary, by a dose of 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once weekly. Treatment with LIFMIOR should continue until remission is achieved, for up to 24 weeks. Continuous therapy beyond 24 weeks may be appropriate for some adult patients (see section 5.1). Treatment should be discontinued in patients who show no response after 12 weeks. If re-treatment with LIFMIOR is indicated, the same guidance on treatment duration should be followed. The dose should be 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once weekly.

There is generally no applicable use of LIFMIOR in children aged below 6 years in the indication plaque psoriasis.

Special populations Renal and hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required. Elderly No dose adjustment is required. Posology and administration are the same as for adults 18-64 years of age. Paediatric population The dosage of LIFMIOR is based on body weight for paediatric patients. Patients weighing less than 62.5 kg should be accurately dosed on a mg/kg basis using the powder and solvent for solution for injection presentations or the powder for solution for injection presentations (see below for dosing for specific indication). Patients weighing 62.5 kg or more, may be dosed using a fixed-dose pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis The recommended dose is 0.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 25 mg per dose), given twice weekly as a subcutaneous injection with an interval of 3-4 days between doses or 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) given once weekly. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered in patients who show no response after 4 months. The 10 mg vial strength may be more appropriate for administration to children with JIA below the weight of 25 kg. No formal clinical trials have been conducted in children aged 2 to 3 years. However, limited safety data from a patient registry suggest that the safety profile in children from 2 to 3 years of age is similar to that seen in adults and children aged 4 years and older, when dosed every week with 0.8 mg/kg subcutaneously (see section 5.1). There is generally no applicable use of LIFMIOR in children aged below 2 years in the indication juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Paediatric plaque psoriasis (age 6 years and above) The recommended dose is 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly for up to 24 weeks. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who show no response after 12 weeks. If re-treatment with LIFMIOR is indicated, the above guidance on treatment duration should be followed. The dose should be 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Method of administration LIFMIOR is administered by subcutaneous injection (see section 6.6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Comprehensive instructions for administration are given in the package leaflet, section 7, 'Using the MYCLIC pre-filled pen to inject LIFMIOR.'

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Sepsis or risk of sepsis. Treatment with LIFMIOR should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or localised infections. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trademark and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. Infections Patients should be evaluated for infections before, during, and after treatment with LIFMIOR, taking into consideration that the mean elimination half-life of etanercept is approximately 70 hours (range 7 to 300 hours). Serious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis, and opportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections, listeriosis and legionellosis, have been reported with the use of LIFMIOR (see section 4.8). These infections were due to bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites (including protozoa). In some cases, particular fungal and other opportunistic infections have not been recognised, resulting in delay of appropriate treatment and sometimes death. In evaluating patients for infections, the patient's risk for relevant opportunistic infections (e.g., exposure to endemic mycoses) should be considered. Patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with LIFMIOR should be monitored closely. Administration of LIFMIOR should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. The safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with chronic infections have not been evaluated. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of LIFMIOR in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions that may predispose patients to infections such as advanced or poorly controlled diabetes. Tuberculosis Cases of active tuberculosis including miliary tuberculosis and tuberculosis with extra-pulmonary location have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Before starting treatment with LIFMIOR, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive ('latent') tuberculosis. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with personal history of tuberculosis or possible previous contact with tuberculosis and previous and/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests, i.e., tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the conduct of these tests should be recorded in the patient's alert card. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised. Medicinal product no longer authorised

If active tuberculosis is diagnosed, LIFMIOR therapy must not be initiated. If inactive ('latent') tuberculosis is diagnosed, treatment for latent tuberculosis must be started with anti-tuberculosis therapy before the initiation of LIFMIOR, and in accordance with local recommendations. In this situation, the benefit/risk balance of LIFMIOR therapy should be very carefully considered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All patients should be informed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low-grade fever) appear during or after LIFMIOR treatment.

## Hepatitis B reactivation

Reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were previously infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and had received concomitant TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR, has been reported. This includes reports of reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were anti-HBc positive but HBsAg negative. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with LIFMIOR. For patients who test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. Caution should be exercised when administering LIFMIOR in patients previously infected with HBV. These patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several weeks following termination of therapy. Adequate data from treating patients infected with HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy are not available. In patients who develop HBV infection, LIFMIOR should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. Worsening of hepatitis C There have been reports of worsening of hepatitis C in patients receiving LIFMIOR. LIFMIOR should be used with caution in patients with a history of hepatitis C. Concurrent treatment with anakinra Concurrent administration of LIFMIOR and anakinra has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections and neutropenia compared to LIFMIOR alone. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit. Thus the combined use of LIFMIOR and anakinra is not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). Concurrent treatment with abatacept In clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and LIFMIOR resulted in increased incidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.5). Allergic reactions Allergic reactions associated with LIFMIOR administration have been reported commonly. Allergic reactions have included angioedema and urticaria; serious reactions have occurred. If any serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, LIFMIOR therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. The needle cap of the pre-filled pen contains latex (dry natural rubber) that may cause hypersensitivity reactions when handled by or when LIFMIOR is administered to persons with known or possible latex sensitivity. Immunosuppression The possibility exists for TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR, to affect host defences against infections and malignancies since TNF mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune responses. In a study of 49 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with LIFMIOR, there was no evidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in enumeration of effector cell populations. Two juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients developed varicella infection and signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae. Patients with a significant exposure to varicella virus should temporarily discontinue LIFMIOR therapy and be considered for prophylactic treatment with Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with immunosuppression have not been evaluated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders

## Solid and haematopoietic malignancies (excluding skin cancers)

Reports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have been received in the postmarketing period (see section 4.8).

In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. However, the occurrence was rare, and the follow-up period of placebo patients was shorter than for patients receiving TNF-antagonist therapy. In the postmarketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, which complicates risk estimation. Based on current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia or other haematopoietic or solid malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. Caution should be exercised when considering TNF-antagonist therapy for patients with a history of malignancy or when considering continuing treatment in patients who develop a malignancy. Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to 22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including LIFMIOR, in the postmarketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies typically associated with immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. Skin cancers Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) have been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR. Postmarketing cases of Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported very infrequently in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Periodic skin examination is recommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer. Combining the results of controlled clinical trials, more cases of NMSC were observed in patients receiving LIFMIOR compared with control patients, particularly in patients with psoriasis. Vaccinations Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with LIFMIOR. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving LIFMIOR. In a double blind, placebo controlled, randomised clinical study in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis 184 patients also received a multivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at week 4. In this study most psoriatic arthritis patients receiving LIFMIOR were able to mount effective B-cell immune response to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, but titres in aggregate were moderately lower and few patients had two-fold rises in titres compared to patients not receiving LIFMIOR. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Autoantibody formation Treatment with LIFMIOR may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies (see section 4.8). Haematologic reactions Medicinal product no longer authorised

Rare cases of pancytopenia and very rare cases of aplastic anaemia, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Caution should be exercised in patients being treated with LIFMIOR who have a previous history of blood dyscrasias. All patients and parents/caregivers should be advised that if the patient develops signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infections (e.g., persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding, paleness) whilst on LIFMIOR, they should seek immediate medical advice. Such patients should be investigated urgently, including full blood count; if blood dyscrasias are confirmed, LIFMIOR should be discontinued.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Neurological disorders

There have been rare reports of CNS demyelinating disorders in patients treated with LIFMIOR (see section 4.8). Additionally, there have been rare reports of peripheral demyelinating polyneuropathies (including Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy). Although no clinical trials have been performed evaluating LIFMIOR therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis, clinical trials of other TNF antagonists in patients with multiple sclerosis have shown increases in disease activity. A careful risk/benefit evaluation, including a neurologic assessment, is recommended when prescribing LIFMIOR to patients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating disease, or to those who are considered to have an increased risk of developing demyelinating disease.

## Hypoglycaemia in patients treated for diabetes

Combination therapy In a controlled clinical trial of two years duration in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the combination of LIFMIOR and methotrexate did not result in unexpected safety findings, and the safety profile of LIFMIOR when given in combination with methotrexate was similar to the profiles reported in studies of LIFMIOR and methotrexate alone. Long-term studies to assess the safety of the combination are ongoing. The long-term safety of LIFMIOR in combination with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) has not been established. The use of LIFMIOR in combination with other systemic therapies or phototherapy for the treatment of psoriasis has not been studied. Renal and hepatic impairment Based on pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2), no dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal or hepatic impairment; clinical experience in such patients is limited. Congestive heart failure (Cardiac failure congestive) Physicians should use caution when using LIFMIOR in patients who have congestive heart failure (CHF). There have been postmarketing reports of worsening of CHF, with and without identifiable precipitating factors, in patients taking LIFMIOR. There have also been rare (&lt; 0.1%) reports of new onset CHF, including CHF in patients without known pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Some of these patients have been under 50 years of age. Two large clinical trials evaluating the use of LIFMIOR in the treatment of CHF were terminated early due to lack of efficacy. Although not conclusive, data from one of these trials suggest a possible tendency toward worsening CHF in those patients assigned to LIFMIOR treatment. Alcoholic hepatitis In a phase II randomised placebo-controlled study of 48 hospitalised patients treated with LIFMIOR or placebo for moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis, LIFMIOR was not efficacious, and the mortality rate in patients treated with LIFMIOR was significantly higher after 6 months. Consequently, LIFMIOR should not be used in patients for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. Physicians should use caution when using LIFMIOR in patients who also have moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis. Wegener's granulomatosis A placebo-controlled trial, in which 89 adult patients were treated with LIFMIOR in addition to standard therapy (including cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, and glucocorticoids) for a median duration of 25 months, has not shown LIFMIOR to be an effective treatment for Wegener's granulomatosis. The incidence of non-cutaneous malignancies of various types was significantly higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR than in the control group. LIFMIOR is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis. Medicinal product no longer authorised

There have been reports of hypoglycaemia following initiation of LIFMIOR in patients receiving medication for diabetes, necessitating a reduction in anti-diabetic medication in some of these patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Elderly

In the Phase 3 studies in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, no overall differences in adverse events, serious adverse events, and serious infections in patients age 65 or older who received LIFMIOR were observed compared with younger patients. However, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly and particular attention paid with respect to occurrence of infections.

Paediatric population Vaccinations It is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating LIFMIOR therapy (see Vaccinations, above). Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and uveitis in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) There have been reports of IBD and uveitis in JIA patients being treated with LIFMIOR (see section 4.8). 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concurrent treatment with anakinra Adult patients treated with LIFMIOR and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious infection when compared with patients treated with either LIFMIOR or anakinra alone (historical data). In addition, in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in adult patients receiving background methotrexate, patients treated with LIFMIOR and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with LIFMIOR (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The combination LIFMIOR and anakinra has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit and is therefore not recommended. Concurrent treatment with abatacept In clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and LIFMIOR resulted in increased incidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.4). Concurrent treatment with sulfasalazine In a clinical study of adult patients who were receiving established doses of sulfasalazine, to which LIFMIOR was added, patients in the combination group experienced a statistically significant decrease in mean white blood cell counts in comparison to groups treated with LIFMIOR or sulfasalazine alone. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Physicians should use caution when considering combination therapy with sulfasalazine. Non-interactions In clinical trials, no interactions have been observed when LIFMIOR was administered with glucocorticoids, salicylates (except sulfasalazine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, or methotrexate. See section 4.4 for vaccination advice. No clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions were observed in studies with methotrexate, digoxin or warfarin.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential should consider the use of appropriate contraception to avoid becoming pregnant during LIFMIOR therapy and for three weeks after discontinuation of therapy.

Pregnancy Developmental toxicity studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of harm to the foetus or neonatal rat due to etanercept. The effects of etanercept on pregnancy outcomes have been investigated in two observational cohort studies. A higher rate of major birth defects was observed in one observational study comparing pregnancies exposed to etanercept (n=370) during the first trimester with pregnancies not exposed to etanercept or other TNF-antagonists (n=164) (adjusted odds ratio 2.4, 95% CI: 1.0-5.5). The types of major birth defects were consistent with those most commonly reported in the general population and no particular pattern of abnormalities was identified. No change in the rate of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or minor malformations was observed. In another observational multi-country registry study comparing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to etanercept during the first 90 days of pregnancy (n=425) to those exposed to non-biologic drugs (n=3497), there was no observed increased risk of major birth defects (crude odds ratio [OR]= 1.22, 95% CI: 0.79-1.90; adjusted OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.58-1.60 after adjusting for country, maternal disease, parity, maternal age and smoking in early pregnancy). This study also showed no increased risks of minor birth defects, preterm birth, stillbirth, or infections in the first year of life for infants born to women exposed to etanercept during pregnancy. LIFMIOR should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. Etanercept crosses the placenta and has been detected in the serum of infants born to female patients treated with LIFMIOR during pregnancy. The clinical impact of this is unknown, however, infants may be at increased risk of infection. Administration of live vaccines to infants for 16 weeks after the mother's last dose of LIFMIOR is generally not recommended. Breast-feeding Etanercept has been reported to be excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration. In lactating rats following subcutaneous administration, etanercept was excreted in the milk and detected in the serum of pups. Because immunoglobulins, in common with many medicinal products, can be excreted in human milk, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue LIFMIOR therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. Fertility Preclinical data about peri- and postnatal toxicity of etanercept and of effects of etanercept on fertility and general reproductive performance are not available. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The most commonly reported adverse reactions are injection site reactions (such as pain, swelling, itching, reddening and bleeding at the puncture site), infections (such as upper respiratory infections, bronchitis, bladder infections and skin infections), allergic reactions, development of autoantibodies, itching, and fever.

Serious adverse reactions have also been reported for LIFMIOR. TNF-antagonists, such as LIFMIOR, affect the immune system and their use may affect the body's defenses against infection and cancer. Serious infections affect fewer than 1 in 100 patients treated with LIFMIOR. Reports have included

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

fatal and life-threatening infections and sepsis. Various malignancies have also been reported with use of LIFMIOR, including cancers of the breast, lung, skin and lymph glands (lymphoma).

Serious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These include rare reports of pancytopenia and very rare reports of aplastic anaemia. Central and peripheral demyelinating events have been seen rarely and very rarely, respectively, with LIFMIOR use. There have been rare reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions, and vasculitis.

*see Description of selected adverse reactions, below. Description of selected adverse reactions Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders One hundred and twenty-nine new malignancies of various types were observed in 4,114 rheumatoid arthritis patients treated in clinical trials with LIFMIOR for up to approximately 6 years, including 231 patients treated with LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate in the 2-year active-controlled study. The observed rates and incidences in these clinical trials were similar to those expected for the population studied. A total of 2 malignancies were reported in clinical studies of approximately 2 years duration involving 240 LIFMIOR-treated psoriatic arthritis patients. In clinical studies conducted for more than 2 years with 351 ankylosing spondylitis patients, 6 malignancies were reported in LIFMIOR-treated patients. In a group of 2,711 plaque psoriasis patients treated with LIFMIOR in double-blind and open-label studies of up to 2.5 years, 30 malignancies and 43 nonmelanoma skin cancers were reported.

In a group of 7,416 patients treated with LIFMIOR in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis clinical trials, 18 lymphomas were reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Reports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have also been received in the postmarketing period (see section 4.4).

## Injection site reactions

Compared to placebo, patients with rheumatic diseases treated with LIFMIOR had a significantly higher incidence of injection site reactions (36% vs. 9%). Injection site reactions usually occurred in the first month. Mean duration was approximately 3 to 5 days. No treatment was given for the majority of injection site reactions in the LIFMIOR treatment groups, and the majority of patients who were given treatment received topical preparations such as corticosteroids, or oral antihistamines. Additionally, some patients developed recall injection site reactions characterised by a skin reaction at the most recent site of injection along with the simultaneous appearance of injection site reactions at previous injection sites. These reactions were generally transient and did not recur with treatment. In controlled trials in patients with plaque psoriasis, approximately 13.6% of patients treated with LIFMIOR developed injection site reactions compared with 3.4% of placebo-treated patients during the first 12 weeks of treatment. Serious infections In placebo-controlled trials, no increase in the incidence of serious infections (fatal, life threatening, or requiring hospitalisation or intravenous antibiotics) was observed. Serious infections occurred in 6.3% of rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with LIFMIOR for up to 48 months. These included abscess (at various sites), bacteraemia, bronchitis, bursitis, cellulitis, cholecystitis, diarrhoea, diverticulitis, endocarditis (suspected), gastroenteritis, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, leg ulcer, mouth infection, osteomyelitis, otitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, sepsis, septic arthritis, sinusitis, skin infection, skin ulcer, urinary tract infection, vasculitis, and wound infection. In the 2-year active-controlled study where patients were treated with either LIFMIOR alone, methotrexate alone or LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate, the rates of serious infections were similar among the treatment groups. However, it cannot be excluded that the combination of LIFMIOR with methotrexate could be associated with an increase in the rate of infections. There were no differences in rates of infection among patients treated with LIFMIOR and those treated with placebo for plaque psoriasis in placebo-controlled trials of up to 24 weeks duration. Serious infections experienced by LIFMIOR-treated patients included cellulitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, cholecystitis, osteomyelitis, gastritis, appendicitis, Streptococcal fasciitis, myositis, septic shock, diverticulitis and abscess. In the double-blind and open-label psoriatic arthritis trials, 1 patient reported a serious infection (pneumonia). Serious and fatal infections have been reported during use of LIFMIOR; reported pathogens include bacteria, mycobacteria (including tuberculosis), viruses and fungi. Some have occurred within a few weeks after initiating treatment with LIFMIOR in patients who have underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes, congestive heart failure, history of active or chronic infections) in addition to their rheumatoid arthritis (see section 4.4). LIFMIOR treatment may increase mortality in patients with established sepsis. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Opportunistic infections have been reported in association with LIFMIOR, including invasive fungal, parasitic (including protozoal), viral (including herpes zoster), bacterial (including Listeria and Legionella ), and atypical mycobacterial infections. In a pooled data set of clinical trials, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was 0.09% for the 15,402 subjects who received LIFMIOR. The exposure-adjusted rate was 0.06 events per 100 patient-years. In postmarketing experience, approximately half of all of the case reports of opportunistic infections worldwide were invasive fungal infections. The most commonly reported invasive fungal infections included Candida, Pneumocystis, Aspergillus, and Histoplasma . Invasive fungal infections accounted for more than half of the fatalities amongst patients who developed opportunistic infections. The majority of the reports with a fatal outcome were in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, unspecified systemic fungal infections, and aspergillosis (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Autoantibodies

Adult patients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple timepoints. Of the rheumatoid arthritis patients evaluated for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), the percentage of patients who developed new positive ANA ( ≥ 1:40) was higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR (11%) than in placebo-treated patients (5%). The percentage of patients who developed new positive anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies was also higher by radioimmunoassay (15% of patients treated with LIFMIOR compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients) and by Crithidia luciliae assay (3% of patients treated with LIFMIOR compared to none of placebo-treated patients). The proportion of patients treated with LIFMIOR who developed anticardiolipin antibodies was similarly increased compared to placebo-treated patients. The impact of long-term treatment with LIFMIOR on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown.

## Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis

There have been rare reports of patients, including rheumatoid factor positive patients, who have developed other autoantibodies in conjunction with a lupus-like syndrome or rashes that are compatible with subacute cutaneous lupus or discoid lupus by clinical presentation and biopsy. Pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia There have been postmarketing reports of pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia, some of which had fatal outcomes (see section 4.4). Interstitial lung disease In controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of interstitial lung disease in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.06% (frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of interstitial lung disease was 0.47% (frequency uncommon). There have been postmarketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of which had fatal outcomes. Concurrent treatment with anakinra In studies when adult patients received concurrent treatment with LIFMIOR plus anakinra, a higher rate of serious infections compared to LIFMIOR alone was observed and 2% of patients (3/139) developed neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1000/mm 3 ). While neutropenic, one patient developed cellulitis that resolved after hospitalisation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). Elevated liver enzymes In the double-blind periods of controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.54% (frequency uncommon). In the double-blind periods of controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes was 4.18% (frequency common). Autoimmune hepatitis In controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.02% (frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of autoimmune hepatitis was 0.24% (frequency uncommon).

In general, the adverse events in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult patients. Differences from adults and other special considerations are discussed in the following paragraphs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The types of infections seen in clinical trials in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients aged 2 to 18 years were generally mild to moderate and consistent with those commonly seen in outpatient paediatric populations. Severe adverse events reported included varicella with signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae (see also section 4.4), appendicitis, gastroenteritis, depression/personality disorder, cutaneous ulcer, oesophagitis/gastritis, group A streptococcal septic shock, type I diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and post-operative wound infection.

In one study in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis aged 4 to 17 years, 43 of 69 (62%) children experienced an infection while receiving LIFMIOR during 3 months of the study (part 1, open-label), and the frequency and severity of infections was similar in 58 patients completing 12 months of open-label extension therapy. The types and proportion of adverse events in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients were similar to those seen in trials of LIFMIOR in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and the majority were mild. Several adverse events were reported more commonly in 69 juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients receiving 3 months of LIFMIOR compared to the 349 adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. These included headache (19% of patients, 1.7 events per patient year), nausea (9%, 1.0 event per patient year), abdominal pain (19%, 0.74 events per patient year), and vomiting (13%, 0.74 events per patient year). There were 4 reports of macrophage activation syndrome in juvenile idiopathic arthritis clinical trials. There have been reports of inflammatory bowel disease and uveitis in JIA patients being treated with LIFMIOR from post-marketing sources, including a very small number of cases indicating a positive rechallenge (see section 4.4). Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis In a 48-week study in 211 children aged 4 to 17 years with paediatric plaque psoriasis, the adverse events reported were similar to those seen in previous studies in adults with plaque psoriasis. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose No dose-limiting toxicities were observed during clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis patients. The highest dose level evaluated has been an intravenous loading dose of 32 mg/m 2 followed by subcutaneous doses of 16 mg/m 2 administered twice weekly. One rheumatoid arthritis patient mistakenly self-administered 62 mg LIFMIOR subcutaneously twice weekly for 3 weeks without experiencing undesirable effects. There is no known antidote to LIFMIOR. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors, ATC code: L04AB01 Medicinal product no longer authorised

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a dominant cytokine in the inflammatory process of rheumatoid arthritis. Elevated levels of TNF are also found in the synovium and psoriatic plaques of patients with psoriatic arthritis and in serum and synovial tissue of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. In plaque psoriasis, infiltration by inflammatory cells including T-cells leads to increased TNF levels in psoriatic lesions compared with levels in uninvolved skin. Etanercept is a competitive inhibitor of TNF-binding to its cell surface receptors and thereby inhibits the biological activity of TNF. TNF and lymphotoxin are pro-inflammatory cytokines that bind to two distinct cell surface receptors: the 55-kilodalton (p55)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and 75-kilodalton (p75) tumour necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Both TNFRs exist naturally in membrane-bound and soluble forms. Soluble TNFRs are thought to regulate TNF biological activity.

TNF and lymphotoxin exist predominantly as homotrimers, with their biological activity dependent on cross-linking of cell surface TNFRs. Dimeric soluble receptors such as etanercept possess a higher affinity for TNF than monomeric receptors and are considerably more potent competitive inhibitors of TNF binding to its cellular receptors. In addition, use of an immunoglobulin Fc region as a fusion element in the construction of a dimeric receptor imparts a longer serum half-life.

After discontinuation of LIFMIOR, symptoms of arthritis generally returned within a month. Re-introduction of treatment with LIFMIOR after discontinuation of up to 24 months resulted in the same magnitudes of responses as patients who received LIFMIOR without interruption of therapy based on results of open-label studies. Continued durable responses have been seen for up to 10 years in open-label extension treatment trials when patients received LIFMIOR without interruption.

Mechanism of action Much of the joint pathology in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and skin pathology in plaque psoriasis is mediated by pro-inflammatory molecules that are linked in a network controlled by TNF. The mechanism of action of etanercept is thought to be its competitive inhibition of TNF binding to cell surface TNFR, preventing TNF-mediated cellular responses by rendering TNF biologically inactive. Etanercept may also modulate biologic responses controlled by additional downstream molecules (e.g., cytokines, adhesion molecules, or proteinases) that are induced or regulated by TNF. Clinical efficacy and safety This section presents data from four randomised controlled trials in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, one study in adults with psoriatic arthritis, one study in adults with ankylosing spondylitis, one study in adults with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, four studies in adults with plaque psoriasis, three studies in juvenile idiopathic arthritis and one study in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. Adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis The efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study evaluated 234 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Doses of 10 mg or 25 mg LIFMIOR or placebo were administered subcutaneously twice a week for 6 consecutive months. The results of this controlled trial were expressed in percentage improvement in rheumatoid arthritis using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria. ACR 20 and 50 responses were higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR at 3 and 6 months than in patients treated with placebo (ACR 20: LIFMIOR 62% and 59%, placebo 23% and 11% at 3 and 6 months respectively: ACR 50: LIFMIOR 41% and 40%, placebo 8% and 5% at months 3 and 6, respectively; p&lt;0.01 LIFMIOR vs placebo at all timepoints for both ACR 20 and ACR 50 responses). Approximately 15% of subjects who received LIFMIOR achieved an ACR 70 response at month 3 and month 6 compared to fewer than 5% of subjects in the placebo arm. Among patients receiving LIFMIOR, the clinical responses generally appeared within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of therapy and nearly always occurred by 3 months. A dose response was seen; results with 10 mg were intermediate between placebo and 25 mg. LIFMIOR was significantly better than placebo in all components of the ACR criteria as well as other measures of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity not included in the ACR response criteria, such as morning stiffness. A Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), which included disability, vitality, mental health, general health status, and arthritis-associated health status subdomains, was administered every 3 months during the trial. All subdomains of the HAQ were improved in patients treated with LIFMIOR compared to controls at 3 and 6 months. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The efficacy of LIFMIOR was compared to methotrexate in a randomised, active-controlled study with blinded radiographic evaluations as a primary endpoint in 632 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (&lt;3 years duration) who had never received treatment with methotrexate. Doses of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

10 mg or 25 mg LIFMIOR were administered SC twice a week for up to 24 months. Methotrexate doses were escalated from 7.5 mg/week to a maximum of 20 mg/week over the first 8 weeks of the trial and continued for up to 24 months. Clinical improvement including onset of action within 2 weeks with LIFMIOR 25 mg was similar to that seen in the previous trials, and was maintained for up to 24 months. At baseline, patients had a moderate degree of disability, with mean HAQ scores of 1.4 to 1.5. Treatment with LIFMIOR 25 mg resulted in substantial improvement at 12 months, with about 44% of patients achieving a normal HAQ score (less than 0.5). This benefit was maintained in Year 2 of this study.

In this study, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score. Radiographs of hands/wrists and feet were read at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months. The 10 mg LIFMIOR dose had consistently less effect on structural damage than the 25 mg dose. LIFMIOR 25 mg was significantly superior to methotrexate for erosion scores at both 12 and 24 months. The differences in TSS and JSN were not statistically significant between methotrexate and LIFMIOR 25 mg. The results are shown in the figure below. Radiographic Progression: Comparison of LIFMIOR vs Methotrexate in Patients with RA of &lt;3 Years Duration In another active-controlled, double-blind, randomised study, clinical efficacy, safety, and radiographic progression in RA patients treated with LIFMIOR alone (25 mg twice weekly), methotrexate alone (7.5 to 20 mg weekly, median dose 20 mg), and of the combination of LIFMIOR and methotrexate initiated concurrently were compared in 682 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis of 6 months to 20 years duration (median 5 years) who had a less than satisfactory response to at least 1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) other than methotrexate. Patients in the LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate therapy group had significantly higher ACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70 responses and improvement for DAS and HAQ scores at both 24 and 52 weeks than patients in either of the single therapy groups (results shown in table below). Significant advantages for LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate compared with LIFMIOR monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months.

Significant advantages for LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate compared with LIFMIOR monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months. Similarly, the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

significant advantages for LIFMIOR monotherapy compared with methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months.

In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were considered to have progressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change ≤ 0.5) at 24 months was higher in the LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate group compared with the LIFMIOR alone and methotrexate alone groups (62%, 50%, and 36%, respectively; p&lt;0.05). The difference between LIFMIOR alone and methotrexate alone was also significant (p&lt;0.05). Among patients who completed a full 24 months of therapy in the study, the non-progression rates were 78%, 70%, and 61%, respectively.

The safety and efficacy of 50 mg LIFMIOR (two 25 mg SC injections) administered once weekly were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 420 patients with active RA. In this study, 53 patients received placebo, 214 patients received 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly and 153 patients received 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly. The safety and efficacy profiles of the two LIFMIOR treatment regimens were comparable at week 8 in their effect on signs and symptoms of RA; data at week 16 did not show comparability (non-inferiority) between the two regimens. A single 50 mg/ml injection of LIFMIOR was found to be bioequivalent to two simultaneous injections of 25 mg/ml. Adult patients with psoriatic arthritis The efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 205 patients with psoriatic arthritis. Patients were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active psoriatic arthritis ( ≥ 3 swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender joints) in at least one of the following forms: (1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement; (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of psoriasis); (3) arthritis mutilans; (4) asymmetric psoriatic arthritis; or (5) spondylitislike ankylosis. Patients also had plaque psoriasis with a qualifying target lesion ≥ 2 cm in diameter. Patients had previously been treated with NSAIDs (86%), DMARDs (80%), and corticosteroids (24%). Patients currently on methotrexate therapy (stable for ≥ 2 months) could continue at a stable dose of ≤ 25 mg/week methotrexate. Doses of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (based on dose-finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered SC twice a week for 6 months. At the end of the double-blind study, patients could enter a long-term open-label extension study for a total duration of up to 2 years. Clinical responses were expressed as percentages of patients achieving the ACR 20, 50, and 70 response and percentages with improvement in Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC).

LIFMIOR treatment resulted in improvement in physical function during the double-blind period, and this benefit was maintained during the longer-term exposure of up to 2 years.

a: 25 mg LIFMIOR SC twice weekly b: p &lt; 0.001, LIFMIOR vs. placebo c: p &lt; 0.01, LIFMIOR vs. placebo Among patients with psoriatic arthritis who received LIFMIOR, the clinical responses were apparent at the time of the first visit (4 weeks) and were maintained through 6 months of therapy. LIFMIOR was significantly better than placebo in all measures of disease activity (p &lt; 0.001), and responses were similar with and without concomitant methotrexate therapy. Quality of life in psoriatic arthritis patients was assessed at every timepoint using the disability index of the HAQ. The disability index score was significantly improved at all timepoints in psoriatic arthritis patients treated with LIFMIOR, relative to placebo (p &lt; 0.001). Radiographic changes were assessed in the psoriatic arthritis study. Radiographs of hands and wrists were obtained at baseline and months 6, 12, and 24. The modified TSS at 12 months is presented in the Table below. In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were considered to have progressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change ≤ 0.5) at 12 months was higher in the LIFMIOR group compared with the placebo group (73% vs. 47%, respectively, p ≤ 0.001). The effect of LIFMIOR on radiographic progression was maintained in patients who continued on treatment during the second year. The slowing of peripheral joint damage was observed in patients with polyarticular symmetrical joint involvement.

There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with ankylosing spondylitis-like and arthritis mutilans psoriatic arthropathies due to the small number of patients studied.

No study has been performed in patients with psoriatic arthritis using the 50 mg once weekly dosing regimen. Evidence of efficacy for the once weekly dosing regimen in this patient population has been based on data from the study in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.

Among patients with ankylosing spondylitis who received LIFMIOR, the clinical responses were apparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 6 months of therapy. Responses were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant therapies at baseline.

The efficacy of LIFMIOR in ankylosing spondylitis was assessed in 3 randomised, double-blind studies comparing twice weekly administration of 25 mg LIFMIOR with placebo. A total of 401 patients were enrolled from which 203 were treated with LIFMIOR. The largest of these trials (n= 277) enrolled patients who were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active ankylosing spondylitis defined as visual analog scale (VAS) scores of ≥ 30 for average of duration and intensity of morning stiffness plus VAS scores of ≥ 30 for at least 2 of the following 3 parameters: patient global assessment; average of VAS values for nocturnal back pain and total back pain; average of 10 questions on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). Patients receiving DMARDs, NSAIDS, or corticosteroids could continue them on stable doses. Patients with complete ankylosis of the spine were not included in the study. Doses of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (based on dose-finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered subcutaneously twice a week for 6 months in 138 patients. The primary measure of efficacy (ASAS 20) was a ≥ 20% improvement in at least 3 of the 4 Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) domains (patient global assessments, back pain, BASFI, and inflammation) and absence of deterioration in the remaining domain. ASAS 50 and 70 responses used the same criteria with a 50% improvement or a 70% improvement, respectively. Compared to placebo, treatment with LIFMIOR resulted in significant improvements in the ASAS 20, ASAS 50 and ASAS 70 as early as 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy.

In a fourth study, the safety and efficacy of 50 mg LIFMIOR (two 25 mg SC injections) administered once weekly vs 25 mg LIFMIOR administered twice weekly were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 356 patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. The safety and efficacy profiles of the 50 mg once weekly and 25 mg twice weekly regimens were similar.

Clinical responses among nr-AxSpa patients who received LIFMIOR were apparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 2 years of therapy. Improvements in health-related quality of life and physical function were also maintained through 2 years of therapy. The 2 year data did not reveal any new safety findings. At week 104, 8 subjects had progressed to a score of bilateral Grade 2 on spinal X-ray according to the modified New York Radiological Grade, indicative of axial spondyloarthropathy.

The efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpa) was assessed in a randomised, 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study evaluated 215 adult patients (modified intent-to-treat population) with active nr-AxSpa (18 to 49 years of age), defined as those patients meeting the ASAS classification criteria of axial spondyloarthritis but did not meet the modified New York criteria for AS. Patients were also required to have an inadequate response or intolerance to two or more NSAIDs. In the double-blind period, patients received LIFMIOR 50 mg weekly or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary measure of efficacy (ASAS 40) was a 40% improvement in at least three of the four ASAS domains and absence of deterioration in the remaining domain. The double-blind period was followed by an open-label period during which all patients receive LIFMIOR 50 mg weekly for up to an additional 92 weeks. MRIs of the sacroiliac joint and spine were obtained to assess inflammation at baseline and at weeks 12 and 104. Compared to placebo, treatment with LIFMIOR resulted in statistically significant improvement in the ASAS 40, ASAS 20 and ASAS 5/6. Significant improvement was also observed for the ASAS partial remission and BASDAI 50. Week 12 results are shown in the table below.

Adjusted mean change from baseline was 3.8 for LIFMIOR treated (n=95) versus 0.8 for placebo treated (n=105) patients (p&lt;0.001). At week 104, the mean change from baseline in the SPARCC score measured on MRI for all LIFMIOR-treated subjects was 4.64 for the SIJ (n=153) and 1.40 the spine (n=154). LIFMIOR showed statistically significantly greater improvement from baseline to week 12 compared to placebo in most health-related quality of life and physical function assessments, including BASFI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index), EuroQol 5D Overall Health State Score and SF-36 Physical Component Score.

Patients who 'failed to respond to' in the target population is defined by insufficient response (PASI&lt;50 or PGA less than good), or worsening of the disease while on treatment, and who were adequately dosed for a sufficiently long duration to assess response with at least each of the three major systemic therapies as available.

The efficacy of LIFMIOR versus other systemic therapies in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis (responsive to other systemic therapies) has not been evaluated in studies directly comparing LIFMIOR with other systemic therapies. Instead, the safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR were assessed in four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The primary efficacy endpoint in all four studies was the proportion of patients in each treatment group who achieved the PASI 75 (i.e., at least a 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score from baseline) at 12 weeks. Study 1 was a Phase 2 study in patients with active but clinically stable plaque psoriasis involving ≥ 10% of the body surface area that were ≥ 18 years old. One hundred and twelve (112) patients were randomised to receive a dose of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (n=57) or placebo (n=55) twice a week for 24 weeks. Study 2 evaluated 652 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis using the same inclusion criteria as study 1 with the addition of a minimum psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) of 10 at screening. LIFMIOR was administered at doses of 25 mg once a week, 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg twice a week for 6 consecutive months. During the first 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment period, patients received placebo or one of the above three LIFMIOR doses. After 12 weeks of treatment, patients in the placebo group began treatment with blinded LIFMIOR (25 mg twice a week); patients in the active treatment groups continued to week 24 on the dose to which they were originally randomised. Study 3 evaluated 583 patients and had the same inclusion criteria as study 2. Patients in this study received a dose of 25 mg or 50 mg LIFMIOR, or placebo twice a week for 12 weeks and then all patients received open-label 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly for an additional 24 weeks. Study 4 evaluated 142 patients and had similar inclusion criteria to studies 2 and 3. Patients in this study received a dose of 50 mg LIFMIOR or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks and then all patients received open-label 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly for an additional 12 weeks. In study 1, the LIFMIOR-treated group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a PASI 75 response at week 12 (30%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p&lt;0.0001). At 24 weeks, 56% of patients in the LIFMIOR-treated group had achieved the PASI 75 compared to 5% of placebo-treated patients. Key results of studies 2, 3 and 4 are shown below.

## Responses of Patients with Psoriasis in Studies 2, 3 And 4

*p ≤ 0.0001 compared with placebo a. No statistical comparisons to placebo were made at week 24 in studies 2 and 4 because the original placebo group began receiving LIFMIOR 25 mg BIW or 50 mg once weekly from week 13 to week 24. b. Dermatologist Static Global Assessment. Clear or almost clear defined as 0 or 1 on a 0 to 5 scale. Among patients with plaque psoriasis who received LIFMIOR, significant responses relative to placebo were apparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 24 weeks of therapy. Study 2 also had a drug withdrawal period during which patients who achieved a PASI improvement of at least 50% at week 24 had treatment stopped. Patients were observed off treatment for the occurrence of rebound (PASI ≥ 150% of baseline) and for the time to relapse (defined as a loss of at least half of the improvement achieved between baseline and week 24). During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis gradually returned with a median time to disease relapse of 3 months. No rebound flare of disease and no psoriasis-related serious adverse events were observed. There was some evidence to support a benefit of re-treatment with LIFMIOR in patients initially responding to treatment. In study 3, the majority of patients (77%) who were initially randomised to 50 mg twice weekly and had their LIFMIOR dose decreased at week 12 to 25 mg twice weekly maintained their PASI 75 response through week 36. For patients who received 25 mg twice weekly throughout the study, the PASI 75 response continued to improve between weeks 12 and 36. In study 4, the LIFMIOR-treated group had a higher proportion of patients with PASI 75 at week 12 (38%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p&lt;0.0001). For patients who received 50 mg once weekly throughout the study, the efficacy responses continued to improve with 71% achieving PASI 75 at week 24. In long-term (up to 34 months) open-label studies where LIFMIOR was given without interruption, clinical responses were sustained and safety was comparable to shorter-term studies. An analysis of clinical trial data did not reveal any baseline disease characteristics that would assist clinicians in selecting the most appropriate dosing option (intermittent or continuous). Consequently, the choice of intermittent or continuous therapy should be based upon physician judgment and individual patient needs. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Antibodies to LIFMIOR

Antibodies to etanercept have been detected in the sera of some subjects treated with etanercept. These antibodies have all been non-neutralising and are generally transient. There appears to be no correlation between antibody development and clinical response or adverse events.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In subjects treated with approved doses of etanercept in clinical trials for up to 12 months, cumulative rates of anti-etanercept antibodies were approximately 6% of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, 7.5% of subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 2% of subjects with ankylosing spondylitis, 7% of subjects with psoriasis, 9.7% of subjects with paediatric psoriasis, and 4.8% of subjects with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

The proportion of subjects who developed antibodies to etanercept in longer-term trials (of up to 3.5 years) increases over time, as expected. However, due to their transient nature, the incidence of antibodies detected at each assessment point was typically less than 7% in rheumatoid arthritis subjects and psoriasis subjects. In a long-term psoriasis study in which patients received 50 mg twice weekly for 96 weeks, the incidence of antibodies observed at each assessment point was up to approximately 9%. Paediatric population Paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis The safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR were assessed in a two-part study in 69 children with polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who had a variety of juvenile idiopathic arthritis onset types (polyarthritis, pauciarthritis, systemic onset). Patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderately to severely active polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis refractory to, or intolerant of, methotrexate were enrolled; patients remained on a stable dose of a single nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and/or prednisone (&lt; 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg maximum). In part 1, all patients received 0.4 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg per dose) LIFMIOR subcutaneously twice weekly. In part 2, patients with a clinical response at day 90 were randomised to remain on LIFMIOR or receive placebo for four months and assessed for disease flare. Responses were measured using the ACR Pedi 30, defined as ≥ 30% improvement in at least three of six and ≥ 30% worsening in no more than one of six JRA core set criteria, including active joint count, limitation of motion, physician and patient/parent global assessments, functional assessment, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Disease flare was defined as a ≥ 30% worsening in three of six JRA core set criteria and ≥ 30% improvement in not more than one of the six JRA core set criteria and a minimum of two active joints. In part 1 of the study, 51 of 69 (74%) patients demonstrated a clinical response and entered part 2. In part 2, 6 of 25 (24%) patients remaining on LIFMIOR experienced a disease flare compared to 20 of 26 (77%) patients receiving placebo (p=0.007). From the start of part 2, the median time to flare was ≥ 116 days for patients who received LIFMIOR and 28 days for patients who received placebo. Of patients who demonstrated a clinical response at 90 days and entered part 2 of the study, some of the patients remaining on LIFMIOR continued to improve from month 3 through month 7, while those who received placebo did not improve. In an open-label, safety extension study, 58 paediatric patients from the above study (from the age of 4 years at time of enrolment) continued to receive LIFMIOR for up to 10 years. Rates of serious adverse events and serious infections did not increase with long-term exposure. Long-term safety of LIFMIOR monotherapy (n=103), LIFMIOR plus methotrexate (n=294), or methotrexate monotherapy (n=197) were assessed for up to 3 years in a registry of 594 children aged 2 to 18 years with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 39 of whom were 2 to 3 years of age. Overall, infections were more commonly reported in patients treated with etanercept compared to methotrexate alone (3.8 versus 2%), and the infections associated with etanercept use were of a more severe nature.

In another open-label single-arm study, 60 patients with extended oligoarthritis (15 patients aged 2 to 4, 23 patients aged 5 to 11 and 22 patients aged 12 to 17 years old), 38 patients with enthesitis-related arthritis (12 to 17 years old), and 29 patients with psoriatic arthritis (12 to 17 years old) were treated with LIFMIOR at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) administered weekly for 12 weeks. In each of the JIA subtypes, the majority of patients met ACR Pedi 30 criteria and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

demonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of tender joints and physician global assessment. The safety profile was consistent with that observed in other JIA studies.

Studies have not been done in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis to assess the effects of continued LIFMIOR therapy in patients who do not respond within 3 months of initiating LIFMIOR therapy. Additionally, studies have not been conducted to assess the effects of discontinuing or reducing the recommended dose of LIFMIOR following its long-term use in patients with JIA.

Etanercept is slowly absorbed from the site of subcutaneous injection, reaching maximum concentration approximately 48 hours after a single dose. The absolute bioavailability is 76%. With twice weekly doses, it is anticipated that steady-state concentrations are approximately twice as high as those observed after single doses. After a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg LIFMIOR, the average maximum serum concentration observed in healthy volunteers was 1.65 ± 0.66 µ g/ml, and the area under the curve was 235 ± 96.6 µ g · hr/ml.

Paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis The efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 211 paediatric patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (as defined by a sPGA score ≥ 3, involving ≥ 10% of the BSA, and PASI ≥ 12). Eligible patients had a history of receiving phototherapy or systemic therapy, or were inadequately controlled on topical therapy. Patients received LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks. At week 12, more patients randomised to LIFMIOR had positive efficacy responses (e.g. PASI 75) than those randomised to placebo. Paediatric Plaque Psoriasis Outcomes at 12 Weeks Abbreviation: sPGA-static Physician Global Assessment. a. p &lt; 0.0001 compared with placebo. After the 12-week double-blind treatment period, all patients received LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) once weekly for additional 24 weeks. Responses observed during the open-label period were similar to those observed in the double-blind period. During a randomised withdrawal period, significantly more patients re-randomised to placebo experienced disease relapse (loss of PASI 75 response) compared with patients re-randomised to LIFMIOR. With continued therapy, responses were maintained up to 48 weeks. The long-term safety and effectiveness of LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) once weekly was assessed in an open-label extension study of 181 paediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis for up to 2 years beyond the 48 week study discussed above. Long-term experience with LIFMIOR was generally comparable to the original 48-week study and did not reveal any new safety findings. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Etanercept serum values were determined by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method, which may detect ELISA-reactive degradation products as well as the parent compound.

Mean serum concentration profiles at steady state in treated RA patients were C max of 2.4 mg/l vs. 2.6 mg/l, C min of 1.2 mg/l vs. 1.4 mg/l, and partial AUC of 297 mgh/l vs. 316 mgh/l for 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly (n=21) vs. 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly (n=16), respectively. In an openlabel, single-dose, two-treatment, crossover study in healthy volunteers, etanercept administered as a single 50 mg/ml injection was found to be bioequivalent to two simultaneous injections of 25 mg/ml.

In a population pharmacokinetics analysis in ankylosing spondylitis patients, the etanercept steady state AUCs were 466 µ g · hr/ml and 474 µ g · hr/ml for 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly (N = 154) and 25 mg twice weekly (N = 148), respectively. Distribution A biexponential curve is required to describe the concentration time curve of etanercept. The central volume of distribution of etanercept is 7.6 l, while the volume of distribution at steady-state is 10.4 l. Elimination Etanercept is cleared slowly from the body. The half-life is long, approximately 70 hours. Clearance is approximately 0.066 l/hr in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, somewhat lower than the value of 0.11 l/hr observed in healthy volunteers. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of LIFMIOR in rheumatoid arthritis patients, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis patients are similar. There is no apparent pharmacokinetic difference between males and females. Linearity Dose proportionality has not been formally evaluated, but there is no apparent saturation of clearance across the dosing range. Special populations Renal impairment Although there is elimination of radioactivity in urine after administration of radiolabelled etanercept to patients and volunteers, increased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with acute renal failure. The presence of renal impairment should not require a change in dosage. Hepatic impairment Increased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with acute hepatic failure. The presence of hepatic impairment should not require a change in dosage. Elderly The impact of advanced age was studied in the population pharmacokinetic analysis of etanercept serum concentrations. Clearance and volume estimates in patients aged 65 to 87 years were similar to estimates in patients less than 65 years of age. Paediatric population Paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis In a polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis trial with LIFMIOR, 69 patients (aged 4 to 17 years) were administered 0.4 mg LIFMIOR/kg twice weekly for three months. Serum concentration profiles were similar to those seen in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. The youngest children (4 years of age) had reduced clearance (increased clearance when normalised by weight) compared with older children (12 years of age) and adults. Simulation of dosing suggests that while older children (10-17 years of age) will have serum levels close to those seen in adults, younger children will have appreciably lower levels.

## Paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis

Patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis (aged 4 to 17 years) were administered 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 50 mg per week) of etanercept once weekly for up to 48 weeks. The mean serum

steady state trough concentrations ranged from 1.6 to 2.1 mcg/ml at weeks 12, 24, and 48. These mean concentrations in patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis were similar to the concentrations observed in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (treated with 0.4 mg/kg etanercept twice weekly, up to maximum dose of 50 mg per week). These mean concentrations were similar to those seen in adult patients with plaque psoriasis treated with 25 mg etanercept twice weekly.

5.3 Preclinical safety data In the toxicological studies with LIFMIOR, no dose-limiting or target organ toxicity was evident. LIFMIOR was considered to be non-genotoxic from a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies. Carcinogenicity studies, and standard assessments of fertility and postnatal toxicity, were not performed with LIFMIOR due to the development of neutralising antibodies in rodents. LIFMIOR did not induce lethality or notable signs of toxicity in mice or rats following a single subcutaneous dose of 2000 mg/kg or a single intravenous dose of 1000 mg/kg. LIFMIOR did not elicit dose-limiting or target organ toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys following twice weekly subcutaneous administration for 4 or 26 consecutive weeks at a dose (15 mg/kg) that resulted in AUC-based serum drug concentrations that were over 27-fold higher than that obtained in humans at the recommended dose of 25 mg. 6.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis

Treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies.

LIFMIOR 10 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection for paediatric use. 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each vial contains 10 mg of etanercept. When reconstituted, the solution contains 10 mg/ml of etanercept. Etanercept is a human tumour necrosis factor receptor p75 Fc fusion protein produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian expression system. Etanercept is a dimer of a chimeric protein genetically engineered by fusing the extracellular ligand binding domain of human tumour necrosis factor receptor-2 (TNFR2/p75) to the Fc domain of human IgG1. This Fc component contains the hinge, CH 2 and CH3 regions, but not the CH 1 region of IgG1. Etanercept contains 934 amino acids and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons. The specific activity of etanercept is 1.7 x 10 6 units/mg. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Powder and solvent for solution for injection (powder for injection). The powder is white. The solvent is a clear, colourless liquid. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in children and adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. Treatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

LIFMIOR treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis or paediatric plaque psoriasis. Patients treated with LIFMIOR should be given the Patient Alert Card.

<!-- image -->

Posology Special populations Renal and hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required. Paediatric population The  10 mg  presentation  is  for  paediatric  patients  prescribed  a  dose  of  10 mg  or  less.  Each  vial  of LIFMIOR 10 mg should be used on a single occasion in a single patient, and the remainder of the vial should be discarded. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis The recommended dose is 0.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 25 mg per dose) given twice weekly as a subcutaneous injection with an interval of 3-4 days between doses or 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) given once weekly. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered in patients who show no response after 4 months. No formal clinical trials have been conducted in children aged 2 to 3 years. However, limited safety data from a patient registry suggest that the safety profile in children from 2 to 3 years of age is similar to that seen in adults and children aged 4 years and older, when dosed every week with 0.8 mg/kg subcutaneously (see section 5.1). There is generally no applicable use of LIFMIOR in children aged below 2 years in the indication juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Paediatric plaque psoriasis (age 6 years and above) The recommended dose is 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly for up to 24 weeks. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who show no response after 12 weeks. If re-treatment with LIFMIOR is indicated, the above guidance on treatment duration should be followed. The dose should be 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly. There is generally no applicable use of LIFMIOR in children aged below 6 years in the indication plaque psoriasis. Method of administration LIFMIOR is administered by subcutaneous injection. LIFMIOR powder for solution must be reconstituted in 1 ml of solvent before use (see section 6.6). Comprehensive instructions for the preparation and administration of the reconstituted LIFMIOR vial are given in the package leaflet, section 7, \"Instructions for preparation and giving an injection of LIFMIOR.\" Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Sepsis or risk of sepsis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment with LIFMIOR should not be initiated in patients with active infections, including chronic or localised infections.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trademark and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file.

Reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were previously infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and had received concomitant TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR, has been reported. This includes reports of reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were anti-HBc positive but HBsAg negative. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with LIFMIOR. For patients who test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. Caution should be exercised when administering LIFMIOR in patients

Infections Patients should be evaluated for infections before, during, and after treatment with LIFMIOR, taking into consideration that the mean elimination half-life of etanercept is approximately 70 hours (range 7 to 300 hours). Serious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis, and opportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections, listeriosis and legionellosis, have been reported with the use of LIFMIOR (see section 4.8). These infections were due to bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites (including protozoa). In some cases, particular fungal and other opportunistic infections have not been recognised, resulting in delay of appropriate treatment and sometimes death. In evaluating patients for infections, the patient's risk for relevant opportunistic infections (e.g., exposure to endemic mycoses) should be considered. Patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with LIFMIOR should be monitored closely. Administration of LIFMIOR should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. The safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with chronic infections have not been evaluated. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of LIFMIOR in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions that may predispose patients to infections, such as advanced or poorly controlled diabetes. Tuberculosis Cases of active tuberculosis, including miliary tuberculosis and tuberculosis with extra-pulmonary location, have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Before starting treatment with LIFMIOR, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive ('latent') tuberculosis. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with personal history of tuberculosis or possible previous contact with tuberculosis and previous and/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests, i.e., tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the conduct of these tests should be recorded in the patient's alert card. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised. If active tuberculosis is diagnosed, LIFMIOR therapy must not be initiated. If inactive ('latent') tuberculosis is diagnosed, treatment for latent tuberculosis must be started with anti-tuberculosis therapy before the initiation of LIFMIOR, and in accordance with local recommendations. In this situation, the benefit/risk balance of LIFMIOR therapy should be very carefully considered. All patients should be informed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low-grade fever) appear during or after LIFMIOR treatment. Hepatitis B reactivation Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

previously infected with HBV. These patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several weeks following termination of therapy. Adequate data from treating patients infected with HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy are not available. In patients who develop HBV infection, LIFMIOR should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.

Worsening of hepatitis C There have been reports of worsening of hepatitis C in patients receiving LIFMIOR. LIFMIOR should be used with caution in patients with a history of hepatitis C. Concurrent treatment with anakinra Concurrent administration of LIFMIOR and anakinra has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections and neutropenia compared to LIFMIOR alone. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit. Thus, the combined use of LIFMIOR and anakinra is not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). Concurrent treatment with abatacept In clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and LIFMIOR resulted in increased incidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.5). Allergic reactions Allergic reactions associated with LIFMIOR administration have been reported commonly. Allergic reactions have included angioedema and urticaria; serious reactions have occurred. If any serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, LIFMIOR therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. Immunosuppression The possibility exists for TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR, to affect host defences against infections and malignancies since TNF mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune responses. In a study of 49 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with LIFMIOR, there was no evidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in enumeration of effector cell populations. Two juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients developed varicella infection and signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae. Patients with a significant exposure to varicella virus should temporarily discontinue LIFMIOR therapy and be considered for prophylactic treatment with Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin. The safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR in patients with immunosuppression have not been evaluated. Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders Solid and haematopoietic malignancies (excluding skin cancers) Reports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have been received in the postmarketing period (see section 4.8). Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. However, the occurrence was rare, and the follow-up period of placebo patients was shorter than for patients receiving TNF-antagonist therapy. In the postmarketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, which complicates risk estimation.

Based on current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia or other haematopoietic or solid malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Caution should be exercised when considering TNF-antagonist therapy for patients with a history of malignancy or when considering continuing treatment in patients who develop a malignancy.

Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to 22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including LIFMIOR, in the postmarketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies typically associated with immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded.

Skin cancers Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) have been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists, including LIFMIOR. Postmarketing cases of Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported very infrequently in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Periodic skin examination is recommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer. Combining the results of controlled clinical trials, more cases of NMSC were observed in patients receiving LIFMIOR compared with control patients, particularly in patients with psoriasis. Vaccinations Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with LIFMIOR. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving LIFMIOR. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical study in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis, 184 patients also received a multivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at week 4. In this study, most psoriatic arthritis patients receiving LIFMIOR were able to mount effective B-cell immune response to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, but titres in aggregate were moderately lower, and few patients had two-fold rises in titres compared to patients not receiving LIFMIOR. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Autoantibody formation Treatment with LIFMIOR may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies (see section 4.8). Haematologic reactions Rare cases of pancytopenia and very rare cases of aplastic anaemia, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR. Caution should be exercised in patients being treated with LIFMIOR who have a previous history of blood dyscrasias. All patients and parents/caregivers should be advised that if the patient develops signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infections (e.g., persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding, paleness) whilst on LIFMIOR, they should seek immediate medical advice. Such patients should be investigated urgently, including full blood count; if blood dyscrasias are confirmed, LIFMIOR should be discontinued. Neurological disorders There have been rare reports of CNS demyelinating disorders in patients treated with LIFMIOR (see section 4.8). Additionally, there have been rare reports of peripheral demyelinating polyneuropathies (including Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy). Although no clinical trials have been performed evaluating LIFMIOR therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis, clinical trials of other TNF antagonists in patients with multiple sclerosis have shown increases in disease activity. A careful risk/benefit evaluation, including a neurologic assessment, is recommended when prescribing LIFMIOR to patients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating disease, or to those who are considered to have an increased risk of developing demyelinating disease.

## Combination therapy

In a controlled clinical trial of two years duration in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients, the combination of LIFMIOR and methotrexate did not result in unexpected safety findings, and the safety profile of LIFMIOR when given in combination with methotrexate was similar to the profiles reported in studies of LIFMIOR and methotrexate alone. Long-term studies to assess the safety of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

combination are ongoing. The long-term safety of LIFMIOR in combination with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) has not been established.

The use of LIFMIOR in combination with other systemic therapies or phototherapy for the treatment of psoriasis has not been studied.

Renal and hepatic impairment Based on pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2), no dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal or hepatic impairment; clinical experience in such patients is limited. Congestive heart failure (Cardiac failure congestive) Physicians should use caution when using LIFMIOR in patients who have congestive heart failure (CHF). There have been postmarketing reports of worsening of CHF, with and without identifiable precipitating factors, in patients taking LIFMIOR. There have also been rare (&lt; 0.1%) reports of new onset CHF, including CHF in patients without known pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Some of these patients have been under 50 years of age. Two large clinical trials evaluating the use of LIFMIOR in the treatment of CHF were terminated early due to lack of efficacy. Although not conclusive, data from one of these trials suggest a possible tendency toward worsening CHF in those patients assigned to LIFMIOR treatment. Alcoholic hepatitis In a phase II randomised placebo-controlled study of 48 hospitalised patients treated with LIFMIOR or placebo for moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis, LIFMIOR was not efficacious, and the mortality rate in patients treated with LIFMIOR was significantly higher after 6 months. Consequently, LIFMIOR should not be used in patients for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. Physicians should use caution when using LIFMIOR in patients who also have moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis. Wegener's granulomatosis A placebo-controlled trial, in which 89 adult patients were treated with LIFMIOR in addition to standard therapy (including cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, and glucocorticoids) for a median duration of 25 months, has not shown LIFMIOR to be an effective treatment for Wegener's granulomatosis. The incidence of non-cutaneous malignancies of various types was significantly higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR than in the control group. LIFMIOR is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis. Hypoglycaemia in patients treated for diabetes There have been reports of hypoglycaemia following initiation of LIFMIOR in patients receiving medication for diabetes, necessitating a reduction in anti-diabetic medication in some of these patients. Special populations Elderly In the Phase 3 studies in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, no overall differences in adverse events, serious adverse events, and serious infections in patients age 65 or older who received LIFMIOR were observed compared with younger patients. However, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly and particular attention paid with respect to occurrence of infections. Paediatric population Vaccinations Medicinal product no longer authorised

It is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating LIFMIOR therapy (see Vaccinations, above).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and uveitis in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) There have been reports of IBD and uveitis in JIA patients being treated with LIFMIOR (see section 4.8).

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Pregnancy

Developmental toxicity studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of harm to the foetus or neonatal rat due to etanercept. The effects of etanercept on pregnancy outcomes have been investigated in two observational cohort studies. A higher rate of major birth defects was observed in one observational study comparing pregnancies exposed to etanercept (n=370) during the first trimester with pregnancies not exposed to etanercept or other TNF-antagonists (n=164) (adjusted odds ratio 2.4, 95% CI: 1.0-5.5). The types of major birth defects were consistent with those most commonly reported in the general population and no particular pattern of abnormalities was identified. No change in the rate of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or minor malformations was observed. In another observational multi-country registry study comparing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to etanercept during the first 90 days of pregnancy (n=425) to those exposed to non-biologic drugs (n=3497), there was no observed increased risk of major birth defects (crude odds ratio [OR]= 1.22, 95% CI: 0.79-1.90; adjusted OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.58-1.60 after adjusting for country, maternal disease, parity, maternal age and smoking in early pregnancy). This study also

Concurrent treatment with anakinra Adult patients treated with LIFMIOR and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious infection when compared with patients treated with either LIFMIOR or anakinra alone (historical data). In addition, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients receiving background methotrexate, patients treated with LIFMIOR and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with LIFMIOR (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The combination LIFMIOR and anakinra has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit, and is therefore not recommended. Concurrent treatment with abatacept In clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and LIFMIOR resulted in increased incidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.4). Concurrent treatment with sulfasalazine In a clinical study of adult patients who were receiving established doses of sulfasalazine, to which LIFMIOR was added, patients in the combination group experienced a statistically significant decrease in mean white blood cell counts in comparison to groups treated with LIFMIOR or sulfasalazine alone. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Physicians should use caution when considering combination therapy with sulfasalazine. Non-interactions In clinical trials, no interactions have been observed when LIFMIOR was administered with glucocorticoids, salicylates (except sulfasalazine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, or methotrexate. See section 4.4 for vaccination advice. No clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions were observed in studies with methotrexate, digoxin or warfarin. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential Women of childbearing potential should consider the use of appropriate contraception to avoid becoming pregnant during LIFMIOR therapy and for three weeks after discontinuation of therapy. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

showed no increased risks of minor birth defects, preterm birth, stillbirth, or infections in the first year of life for infants born to women exposed to etanercept during pregnancy. LIFMIOR should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed.

Etanercept crosses the placenta and has been detected in the serum of infants born to female patients treated with LIFMIOR during pregnancy. The clinical impact of this is unknown, however, infants may be at increased risk of infection. Administration of live vaccines to infants for 16 weeks after the mother's last dose of LIFMIOR is generally not recommended.

Breast-feeding Etanercept has been reported to be excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration. In lactating rats following subcutaneous administration, etanercept was excreted in the milk and detected in the serum of pups. Because immunoglobulins, in common with many medicinal products, can be excreted in human milk, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue LIFMIOR therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. Fertility Preclinical data about peri- and postnatal toxicity of etanercept and of effects of etanercept on fertility and general reproductive performance are not available. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile Paediatric population Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis In general, the adverse events in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult patients (see below, Undesirable effects in adults). Differences from adults and other special considerations are discussed in the following paragraphs. The types of infections seen in clinical trials in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients aged 2 to 18 years were generally mild to moderate and consistent with those commonly seen in outpatient paediatric populations. Severe adverse events reported included varicella with signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae (see also section 4.4), appendicitis, gastroenteritis, depression/personality disorder, cutaneous ulcer, oesophagitis/gastritis, group A streptococcal septic shock, type I diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and post-operative wound infection. In one study in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis aged 4 to 17 years, 43 of 69 (62%) children experienced an infection while receiving LIFMIOR during 3 months of the study (part 1, open-label), and the frequency and severity of infections was similar in 58 patients completing 12 months of open-label extension therapy. The types and proportion of adverse events in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients were similar to those seen in trials of LIFMIOR in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and the majority were mild. Several adverse events were reported more commonly in 69 juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients receiving 3 months of LIFMIOR compared to the 349 adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. These included headache (19% of patients, 1.7 events per patient year), nausea (9%, 1.0 event per patient year), abdominal pain (19%, 0.74 events per patient year), and vomiting (13%, 0.74 events per patient year). Medicinal product no longer authorised

There were 4 reports of macrophage activation syndrome in juvenile idiopathic arthritis clinical trials.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There have been reports of inflammatory bowel disease and uveitis in JIA patients being treated with LIFMIOR from post-marketing sources, including a very small number of cases indicating a positive rechallenge (see section 4.4).

## Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis

In a 48-week study in 211 children aged 4 to 17 years with paediatric plaque psoriasis, the adverse events reported were similar to those seen in previous studies in adults with plaque psoriasis.

Adult population Undesirable effects in adults The most commonly reported adverse reactions are injection site reactions (such as pain, swelling, itching, reddening and bleeding at the puncture site), infections (such as upper respiratory infections, bronchitis, bladder infections and skin infections), allergic reactions, development of autoantibodies, itching, and fever. Serious adverse reactions have also been reported for LIFMIOR. TNF-antagonists, such as LIFMIOR, affect the immune system and their use may affect the body's defenses against infection and cancer. Serious infections affect fewer than 1 in 100 patients treated with LIFMIOR. Reports have included fatal and life-threatening infections and sepsis. Various malignancies have also been reported with use of LIFMIOR, including cancers of the breast, lung, skin and lymph glands (lymphoma). Serious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These include rare reports of pancytopenia and very rare reports of aplastic anaemia. Central and peripheral demyelinating events have been seen rarely and very rarely, respectively, with LIFMIOR use. There have been rare reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions, and vasculitis. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials in adults and on postmarketing experience. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of patients expected to experience the reaction), using the following categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

In placebo-controlled trials, no increase in the incidence of serious infections (fatal, life-threatening, or requiring hospitalisation or intravenous antibiotics) was observed. Serious infections occurred in 6.3% of rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with LIFMIOR for up to 48 months. These included abscess (at various sites), bacteraemia, bronchitis, bursitis, cellulitis, cholecystitis, diarrhoea, diverticulitis, endocarditis (suspected), gastroenteritis, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, leg ulcer, mouth infection, osteomyelitis, otitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, sepsis, septic arthritis, sinusitis, skin

*see Description of selected adverse reactions, below. † Please see sub-section 'Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis' above. Description of selected adverse reactions Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders One hundred and twenty-nine (129) new malignancies of various types were observed in 4,114 rheumatoid arthritis patients treated in clinical trials with LIFMIOR for up to approximately 6 years, including 231 patients treated with LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate in the 2-year active-controlled study. The observed rates and incidences in these clinical trials were similar to those expected for the population studied. A total of 2 malignancies were reported in clinical studies of approximately 2 years duration involving 240 LIFMIOR-treated psoriatic arthritis patients. In clinical studies conducted for more than 2 years with 351 ankylosing spondylitis patients, 6 malignancies were reported in LIFMIOR-treated patients. In a group of 2,711 plaque psoriasis patients treated with LIFMIOR in double-blind and open-label studies of up to 2.5 years, 30 malignancies and 43 nonmelanoma skin cancers were reported. In a group of 7,416 patients treated with LIFMIOR in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis clinical trials, 18 lymphomas were reported. Reports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have also been received in the postmarketing period (see section 4.4). Injection site reactions Compared to placebo, patients with rheumatic diseases treated with LIFMIOR had a significantly higher incidence of injection site reactions (36% vs. 9%). Injection site reactions usually occurred in the first month. Mean duration was approximately 3 to 5 days. No treatment was given for the majority of injection site reactions in the LIFMIOR treatment groups, and the majority of patients who were given treatment received topical preparations, such as corticosteroids, or oral antihistamines. Additionally, some patients developed recall injection site reactions characterised by a skin reaction at the most recent site of injection, along with the simultaneous appearance of injection site reactions at previous injection sites. These reactions were generally transient and did not recur with treatment. In controlled trials in patients with plaque psoriasis, approximately 13.6% of patients treated with LIFMIOR developed injection site reactions compared with 3.4% of placebo-treated patients during the first 12 weeks of treatment.

infection, skin ulcer, urinary tract infection, vasculitis, and wound infection. In the 2-year active-controlled study where patients were treated with either LIFMIOR alone, methotrexate alone or LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate, the rates of serious infections were similar among the treatment groups. However, it cannot be excluded that the combination of LIFMIOR with methotrexate could be associated with an increase in the rate of infections.

There were no differences in rates of infection among patients treated with LIFMIOR and those treated with placebo for plaque psoriasis in placebo-controlled trials of up to 24 weeks duration. Serious infections experienced by LIFMIOR-treated patients included cellulitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, cholecystitis, osteomyelitis, gastritis, appendicitis, Streptococcal fasciitis, myositis, septic shock, diverticulitis and abscess. In the double-blind and open-label psoriatic arthritis trials, 1 patient reported a serious infection (pneumonia). Serious and fatal infections have been reported during use of LIFMIOR; reported pathogens include bacteria, mycobacteria (including tuberculosis), viruses and fungi. Some have occurred within a few weeks after initiating treatment with LIFMIOR in patients who have underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes, congestive heart failure, history of active or chronic infections) in addition to their rheumatoid arthritis (see section 4.4). LIFMIOR treatment may increase mortality in patients with established sepsis. Opportunistic infections have been reported in association with LIFMIOR, including invasive fungal, parasitic (including protozoal), viral (including herpes zoster), bacterial (including Listeria and Legionella ), and atypical mycobacterial infections. In a pooled data set of clinical trials, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was 0.09% for the 15,402 subjects who received LIFMIOR. The exposure-adjusted rate was 0.06 events per 100 patient-years. In postmarketing experience, approximately half of all of the case reports of opportunistic infections worldwide were invasive fungal infections. The most commonly reported invasive fungal infections included Candida, Pneumocystis, Aspergillus, and Histoplasma . Invasive fungal infections accounted for more than half of the fatalities amongst patients who developed opportunistic infections. The majority of the reports with a fatal outcome were in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, unspecified systemic fungal infections, and aspergillosis (see section 4.4). Autoantibodies Adult patients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple timepoints. Of the rheumatoid arthritis patients evaluated for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), the percentage of patients who developed new positive ANA ( ≥ 1:40) was higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR (11%) than in placebotreated patients (5%). The percentage of patients who developed new positive anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies was also higher by radioimmunoassay (15% of patients treated with LIFMIOR compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients) and by Crithidia luciliae assay (3% of patients treated with LIFMIOR compared to none of placebo-treated patients). The proportion of patients treated with LIFMIOR who developed anticardiolipin antibodies was similarly increased compared to placebo-treated patients. The impact of long-term treatment with LIFMIOR on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. There have been rare reports of patients, including rheumatoid factor positive patients, who have developed other autoantibodies in conjunction with a lupus-like syndrome or rashes that are compatible with subacute cutaneous lupus or discoid lupus by clinical presentation and biopsy. Pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia There have been postmarketing reports of pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia, some of which had fatal outcomes (see section 4.4).

In controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of interstitial lung disease in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.06% (frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of interstitial lung disease was 0.47%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(frequency uncommon). There have been postmarketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of which had fatal outcomes.

## Concurrent treatment with anakinra

In studies when adult patients received concurrent treatment with LIFMIOR plus anakinra, a higher rate of serious infections compared to LIFMIOR alone was observed and 2% of patients (3/139) developed neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1000/mm 3 ). While neutropenic, one patient developed cellulitis that resolved after hospitalisation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a dominant cytokine in the inflammatory process of rheumatoid arthritis. Elevated levels of TNF are also found in the synovium and psoriatic plaques of patients with psoriatic arthritis and in serum and synovial tissue of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. In plaque psoriasis, infiltration by inflammatory cells, including T-cells, leads to increased TNF levels in psoriatic lesions compared with levels in uninvolved skin. Etanercept is a competitive inhibitor of TNF binding to its cell surface receptors, and thereby inhibits the biological activity of TNF. TNF and lymphotoxin are pro-inflammatory cytokines that bind to two distinct cell surface receptors: the 55-kilodalton (p55) and 75-kilodalton (p75) tumour necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Both TNFRs

Elevated liver enzymes In the double-blind periods of controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.54% (frequency uncommon). In the double-blind periods of controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes was 4.18% (frequency common). Autoimmune hepatitis In controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.02% (frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of autoimmune hepatitis was 0.24% (frequency uncommon). Paediatric population See Summary of the safety profile, above. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose No dose-limiting toxicities were observed during clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis patients. The highest dose level evaluated has been an intravenous loading dose of 32 mg/m 2 followed by subcutaneous doses of 16 mg/m 2 administered twice weekly. One rheumatoid arthritis patient mistakenly self-administered 62 mg LIFMIOR subcutaneously twice weekly for 3 weeks without experiencing undesirable effects. There is no known antidote to LIFMIOR. 5.

exist naturally in membrane-bound and soluble forms. Soluble TNFRs are thought to regulate TNF biological activity.

TNF and lymphotoxin exist predominantly as homotrimers, with their biological activity dependent on cross-linking of cell surface TNFRs. Dimeric soluble receptors, such as etanercept, possess a higher affinity for TNF than monomeric receptors and are considerably more potent competitive inhibitors of TNF binding to its cellular receptors. In addition, use of an immunoglobulin Fc region as a fusion element in the construction of a dimeric receptor imparts a longer serum half-life.

Mechanism of action Much of the joint pathology in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and skin pathology in plaque psoriasis is mediated by pro-inflammatory molecules that are linked in a network controlled by TNF. The mechanism of action of etanercept is thought to be its competitive inhibition of TNF binding to cell surface TNFR, preventing TNF-mediated cellular responses by rendering TNF biologically inactive. Etanercept may also modulate biologic responses controlled by additional downstream molecules (e.g., cytokines, adhesion molecules, or proteinases) that are induced or regulated by TNF. Clinical efficacy and safety This section presents data from three studies in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, one study in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis, four studies in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, and four studies in adults with plaque psoriasis. Paediatric population Paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis The safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR were assessed in a two-part study in 69 children with polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who had a variety of juvenile idiopathic arthritis onset types (polyarthritis, pauciarthritis, systemic onset). Patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderately to severely active polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis refractory to, or intolerant of, methotrexate were enrolled; patients remained on a stable dose of a single nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and/or prednisone (&lt; 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg maximum). In part 1, all patients received 0.4 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg per dose) LIFMIOR subcutaneously twice weekly. In part 2, patients with a clinical response at day 90 were randomised to remain on LIFMIOR or receive placebo for four months and assessed for disease flare. Responses were measured using the ACR Pedi 30, defined as ≥ 30% improvement in at least three of six and ≥ 30% worsening in no more than one of six JRA core set criteria, including active joint count, limitation of motion, physician and patient/parent global assessments, functional assessment, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Disease flare was defined as a ≥ 30% worsening in three of six JRA core set criteria and ≥ 30% improvement in not more than one of the six JRA core set criteria and a minimum of two active joints. In part 1 of the study, 51 of 69 (74%) patients demonstrated a clinical response and entered part 2. In part 2, 6 of 25 (24%) patients remaining on LIFMIOR experienced a disease flare compared to 20 of 26 (77%) patients receiving placebo (p=0.007). From the start of part 2, the median time to flare was ≥ 116 days for patients who received LIFMIOR and 28 days for patients who received placebo. Of patients who demonstrated a clinical response at 90 days and entered part 2 of the study, some of the patients remaining on LIFMIOR continued to improve from month 3 through month 7, while those who received placebo did not improve. In an open-label, safety extension study, 58 paediatric patients from the above study (from the age of 4 years at time of enrolment) continued to receive LIFMIOR for up to 10 years. Rates of serious adverse events and serious infections did not increase with long-term exposure. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Long-term safety of LIFMIOR monotherapy (n=103), LIFMIOR plus methotrexate (n=294), or methotrexate monotherapy (n=197) were assessed for up to 3 years in a registry of 594 children aged 2 to 18 years with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 39 of whom were 2 to 3 years of age. Overall, infections

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were more commonly reported in patients treated with etanercept compared to methotrexate alone (3.8 versus 2%), and the infections associated with etanercept use were of a more severe nature.

In another open-label single-arm study, 60 patients with extended oligoarthritis (15 patients aged 2 to 4, 23 patients aged 5 to 11 and 22 patients aged 12 to 17 years old), 38 patients with enthesitis-related arthritis (12 to 17 years old), and 29 patients with psoriatic arthritis (12 to 17 years old) were treated with LIFMIOR at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) administered weekly for 12 weeks. In each of the JIA subtypes, the majority of patients met ACR Pedi 30 criteria and demonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of tender joints and physician global assessment. The safety profile was consistent with that observed in other JIA studies.

Studies have not been done in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis to assess the effects of continued LIFMIOR therapy in patients who do not respond within 3 months of initiating LIFMIOR therapy. Additionally, studies have not been conducted to assess the effects of discontinuing or reducing the recommended dose of LIFMIOR following its long-term use in patients with JIA. Paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis The efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 211 paediatric patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (as defined by an sPGA score ≥ 3, involving ≥ 10% of the BSA, and PASI ≥ 12). Eligible patients had a history of receiving phototherapy or systemic therapy, or were inadequately controlled on topical therapy. Patients received LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks. At week 12, more patients randomised to LIFMIOR had positive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than those randomised to placebo. Paediatric Plaque Psoriasis Outcomes at 12 Weeks Abbreviation: sPGA-static Physician Global Assessment a. p &lt; 0.0001 compared with placebo After the 12-week double-blind treatment period, all patients received LIFMIOR 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) once weekly for additional 24 weeks. Responses observed during the open-label period were similar to those observed in the double-blind period. During a randomised withdrawal period, significantly more patients re-randomised to placebo experienced disease relapse (loss of PASI 75 response) compared with patients re-randomised to LIFMIOR. With continued therapy, responses were maintained up to 48 weeks. The  long-term  safety  and  effectiveness  of  LIFMIOR  0.8 mg/kg  (up  to  50 mg)  once  weekly  was assessed in an open-label extension study of 181 paediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis for up to 2 years beyond the 48 week study discussed above. Long-term experience with LIFMIOR was generally comparable to the original 48-week study and did not reveal any new safety findings. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis

The efficacy of LIFMIOR was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study evaluated 234 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Doses of 10 mg or 25 mg LIFMIOR or placebo were administered subcutaneously twice a week for 6 consecutive

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

months. The results of this controlled trial were expressed in percentage improvement in rheumatoid arthritis using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria.

ACR 20 and 50 responses were higher in patients treated with LIFMIOR at 3 and 6 months than in patients treated with placebo (ACR 20: LIFMIOR 62% and 59%, placebo 23% and 11% at 3 and 6 months, respectively: ACR 50: LIFMIOR 41% and 40%, placebo 8% and 5% at months 3 and 6, respectively; p&lt;0.01 LIFMIOR vs. placebo at all timepoints for both ACR 20 and ACR 50 responses).

Approximately 15% of subjects who received LIFMIOR achieved an ACR 70 response at month 3 and month 6 compared to fewer than 5% of subjects in the placebo arm. Among patients receiving LIFMIOR, the clinical responses generally appeared within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of therapy and nearly always occurred by 3 months. A dose response was seen; results with 10 mg were intermediate between placebo and 25 mg. LIFMIOR was significantly better than placebo in all components of the ACR criteria, as well as other measures of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity not included in the ACR response criteria, such as morning stiffness. A Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), which included disability, vitality, mental health, general health status, and arthritis-associated health status subdomains, was administered every 3 months during the trial. All subdomains of the HAQ were improved in patients treated with LIFMIOR compared to controls at 3 and 6 months. After discontinuation of LIFMIOR, symptoms of arthritis generally returned within a month. Re-introduction of treatment with LIFMIOR after discontinuation of up to 24 months resulted in the same magnitudes of responses as patients who received LIFMIOR without interruption of therapy based on results of open-label studies. Continued durable responses have been seen for up to 10 years in open-label extension treatment trials when patients received LIFMIOR without interruption. The efficacy of LIFMIOR was compared to methotrexate in a randomised, active-controlled study with blinded radiographic evaluations as a primary endpoint in 632 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (&lt;3 years duration) who had never received treatment with methotrexate. Doses of 10 mg or 25 mg LIFMIOR were administered subcutaneously (SC) twice a week for up to 24 months. Methotrexate doses were escalated from 7.5 mg/week to a maximum of 20 mg/week over the first 8 weeks of the trial and continued for up to 24 months. Clinical improvement, including onset of action within 2 weeks with LIFMIOR 25 mg, was similar to that seen in the previous trials and was maintained for up to 24 months. At baseline, patients had a moderate degree of disability, with mean HAQ scores of 1.4 to 1.5. Treatment with LIFMIOR 25 mg resulted in substantial improvement at 12 months, with about 44% of patients achieving a normal HAQ score (less than 0.5). This benefit was maintained in Year 2 of this study. In this study, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score. Radiographs of hands/wrists and feet were read at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months. The 10 mg LIFMIOR dose had consistently less effect on structural damage than the 25 mg dose. LIFMIOR 25 mg was significantly superior to methotrexate for erosion scores at both 12 and 24 months. The differences in TSS and JSN were not statistically significant between methotrexate and LIFMIOR 25 mg. The results are shown in the figure below. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Radiographic Progression: Comparison of LIFMIOR vs. Methotrexate in Patients with RA of &lt;3 Years Duration

<!-- image -->

In another active-controlled, double-blind, randomised study, clinical efficacy, safety, and radiographic progression in RA patients treated with LIFMIOR alone (25 mg twice weekly), methotrexate alone (7.5 to 20 mg weekly, median dose 20 mg), and the combination of LIFMIOR and methotrexate initiated concurrently were compared in 682 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis of 6 months to 20 years duration (median 5 years) who had a less than satisfactory response to at least 1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) other than methotrexate. Patients in the LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate therapy group had significantly higher ACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70 responses and improvement for DAS and HAQ scores at both 24 and 52 weeks than patients in either of the single therapy groups (results shown in table below). Significant advantages for LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate compared with LIFMIOR monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months.

Pairwise comparison p-values: * = p &lt; 0.05 for comparisons of LIFMIOR vs. methotrexate, † = p &lt; 0.05 for comparisons of LIFMIOR + methotrexate vs. methotrexate and φ = p &lt; 0.05 for comparisons of LIFMIOR + methotrexate vs. LIFMIOR. Significant advantages for LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate compared with LIFMIOR monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months. Similarly, the significant advantages for LIFMIOR monotherapy compared with methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months. In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were considered to have progressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change ≤ 0.5) at 24 months was higher in the LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate group compared with the LIFMIOR alone and methotrexate alone groups (62%, 50%, and 36%, respectively; p&lt;0.05). The difference between LIFMIOR alone and methotrexate alone was also significant (p&lt;0.05). Among patients who completed a full 24 months of therapy in the study, the non-progression rates were 78%, 70%, and 61%, respectively. The safety and efficacy of 50 mg LIFMIOR (two 25 mg SC injections) administered once weekly were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 420 patients with active RA. In this study, 53 patients received placebo, 214 patients received 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly and 153 patients received 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly. The safety and efficacy profiles of the two LIFMIOR treatment regimens were comparable at week 8 in their effect on signs and symptoms of RA; data at week 16 did not show comparability (non-inferiority) between the two regimens. Adult patients with plaque psoriasis LIFMIOR is recommended for use in patients as defined in section 4.1. Patients who 'failed to respond to' in the target population is defined by insufficient response (PASI&lt;50 or PGA less than good), or worsening of the disease while on treatment, and who were adequately dosed for a sufficiently long duration to assess response with at least each of the three major systemic therapies as available.

The efficacy of LIFMIOR versus other systemic therapies in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis (responsive to other systemic therapies) has not been evaluated in studies directly comparing LIFMIOR with other systemic therapies. Instead, the safety and efficacy of LIFMIOR were assessed in four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The primary efficacy endpoint in all four

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

studies was the proportion of patients in each treatment group who achieved the PASI 75 (i.e., at least a 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score from baseline) at 12 weeks.

Study 1 was a Phase 2 study in patients with active, but clinically stable, plaque psoriasis involving ≥ 10% of the body surface area who were ≥ 18 years old. One hundred and twelve (112) patients were randomised to receive a dose of 25 mg of LIFMIOR (n=57) or placebo (n=55) twice a week for 24 weeks.

Among patients with plaque psoriasis who received LIFMIOR, significant responses relative to placebo were apparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 24 weeks of therapy.

Study 2 evaluated 652 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis using the same inclusion criteria as study 1 with the addition of a minimum psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) of 10 at screening. LIFMIOR was administered at doses of 25 mg once a week, 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg twice a week for 6 consecutive months. During the first 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment period, patients received placebo or one of the above three LIFMIOR doses. After 12 weeks of treatment, patients in the placebo group began treatment with blinded LIFMIOR (25 mg twice a week); patients in the active treatment groups continued to week 24 on the dose to which they were originally randomised. Study 3 evaluated 583 patients and had the same inclusion criteria as study 2. Patients in this study received a dose of 25 mg or 50 mg LIFMIOR, or placebo twice a week for 12 weeks and then all patients received open-label 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly for an additional 24 weeks. Study 4 evaluated 142 patients and had similar inclusion criteria to studies 2 and 3. Patients in this study received a dose of 50 mg LIFMIOR or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks and then all patients received open-label 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly for an additional 12 weeks. In study 1, the LIFMIOR-treated group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a PASI 75 response at week 12 (30%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p&lt;0.0001). At 24 weeks, 56% of patients in the LIFMIOR-treated group had achieved the PASI 75 compared to 5% of placebo-treated patients. Key results of studies 2, 3 and 4 are shown below.

Study 2 also had a drug withdrawal period during which patients who achieved a PASI improvement of at least 50% at week 24 had treatment stopped. Patients were observed off treatment for the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

occurrence of rebound (PASI ≥ 150% of baseline) and for the time to relapse (defined as a loss of at least half of the improvement achieved between baseline and week 24). During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis gradually returned, with a median time to disease relapse of 3 months. No rebound flare of disease and no psoriasis-related serious adverse events were observed. There was some evidence to support a benefit of re-treatment with LIFMIOR in patients initially responding to treatment.

In study 3, the majority of patients (77%) who were initially randomised to 50 mg twice weekly and had their LIFMIOR dose decreased at week 12 to 25 mg twice weekly maintained their PASI 75 response through week 36. For patients who received 25 mg twice weekly throughout the study, the PASI 75 response continued to improve between weeks 12 and 36. In study 4, the LIFMIOR-treated group had a higher proportion of patients with PASI 75 at week 12 (38%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p&lt;0.0001). For patients who received 50 mg once weekly throughout the study, the efficacy responses continued to improve with 71% achieving PASI 75 at week 24. In long-term (up to 34 months) open-label studies where LIFMIOR was given without interruption, clinical responses were sustained and safety was comparable to shorter-term studies. An analysis of clinical trial data did not reveal any baseline disease characteristics that would assist clinicians in selecting the most appropriate dosing option (intermittent or continuous). Consequently, the choice of intermittent or continuous therapy should be based upon physician judgment and individual patient needs. Antibodies to LIFMIOR Antibodies to etanercept have been detected in the sera of some subjects treated with etanercept. These antibodies have all been non-neutralising and are generally transient. There appears to be no correlation between antibody development and clinical response or adverse events. In subjects treated with approved doses of etanercept in clinical trials for up to 12 months, cumulative rates of anti-etanercept antibodies were approximately 6% of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, 7.5% of subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 2% of subjects with ankylosing spondylitis, 7% of subjects with psoriasis, 9.7% of subjects with paediatric psoriasis, and 4.8% of subjects with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The proportion of subjects who developed antibodies to etanercept in longer-term trials (of up to 3.5 years) increases over time, as expected. However, due to their transient nature, the incidence of antibodies detected at each assessment point was typically less than 7% in rheumatoid arthritis subjects and psoriasis subjects. In a long-term psoriasis study in which patients received 50 mg twice weekly for 96 weeks, the incidence of antibodies observed at each assessment point was up to approximately 9%. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Etanercept serum values were determined by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method, which may detect ELISA-reactive degradation products as well as the parent compound. Special populations Renal impairment Medicinal product no longer authorised

Although there is elimination of radioactivity in urine after administration of radiolabelled etanercept to patients and volunteers, increased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with acute renal failure. The presence of renal impairment should not require a change in dosage.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

Increased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with acute hepatic failure. The presence of hepatic impairment should not require a change in dosage.

## Paediatric population

Paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis In a polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis trial with LIFMIOR, 69 patients (aged 4 to 17 years) were administered 0.4 mg LIFMIOR/kg twice weekly for three months. Serum concentration profiles were similar to those seen in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. The youngest children (4 years of age) had reduced clearance (increased clearance when normalised by weight) compared with older children (12 years of age) and adults. Simulation of dosing suggests that while older children (10-17 years of age) will have serum levels close to those seen in adults, younger children will have appreciably lower levels. Paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis Patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis (aged 4 to 17 years) were administered 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 50 mg per week) of etanercept once weekly for up to 48 weeks. The mean serum steady-state trough concentrations ranged from 1.6 to 2.1 mcg/ml at weeks 12, 24, and 48. These mean concentrations in patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis were similar to the concentrations observed in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (treated with 0.4 mg/kg etanercept twice weekly, up to maximum dose of 50 mg per week). These mean concentrations were similar to those seen in adult patients with plaque psoriasis treated with 25 mg etanercept twice-weekly. Adults Absorption Etanercept is slowly absorbed from the site of subcutaneous injection, reaching maximum concentration approximately 48 hours after a single dose. The absolute bioavailability is 76%. With twice-weekly doses, it is anticipated that steady-state concentrations are approximately twice as high as those observed after single doses. After a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg LIFMIOR, the average maximum serum concentration observed in healthy volunteers was 1.65 ± 0.66 µ g/ml, and the area under the curve was 235 ± 96.6 µ g · hr/ml. Mean serum concentration profiles at steady state in treated RA patients were C max of 2.4 mg/l vs. 2.6 mg/l, C min of 1.2 mg/l vs. 1.4 mg/l, and partial AUC of 297 mgh/l vs. 316 mgh/l for 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly (n=21) vs. 25 mg LIFMIOR twice weekly (n=16), respectively. In an open-label, single-dose, two-treatment, crossover study in healthy volunteers, etanercept administered as a single 50 mg/ml injection was found to be bioequivalent to two simultaneous injections of 25 mg/ml. In a population pharmacokinetics analysis in ankylosing spondylitis patients, the etanercept steady state AUCs were 466 µ g · hr/ml and 474 µ g · hr/ml for 50 mg LIFMIOR once weekly (N= 154) and 25 mg twice weekly (N = 148), respectively. Distribution A biexponential curve is required to describe the concentration time curve of etanercept. The central volume of distribution of etanercept is 7.6 l, while the volume of distribution at steady-state is 10.4 l. Elimination Medicinal product no longer authorised

Etanercept is cleared slowly from the body. The half-life is long, approximately 70 hours. Clearance is approximately 0.066 l/hr in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, somewhat lower than the value of 0.11 l/hr observed in healthy volunteers. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of LIFMIOR in rheumatoid arthritis patients, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis patients are similar. There is no apparent pharmacokinetic difference between males and females.

## Linearity

Dose proportionality has not been formally evaluated, but there is no apparent saturation of clearance across the dosing range.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

In the toxicological studies with LIFMIOR, no dose-limiting or target organ toxicity was evident. LIFMIOR was considered to be non-genotoxic from a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies. Carcinogenicity studies, and standard assessments of fertility and postnatal toxicity, were not performed with LIFMIOR due to the development of neutralising antibodies in rodents. LIFMIOR did not induce lethality or notable signs of toxicity in mice or rats following a single subcutaneous dose of 2000 mg/kg or a single intravenous dose of 1000 mg/kg. LIFMIOR did not elicit dose-limiting or target organ toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys following twice weekly subcutaneous administration for 4 or 26 consecutive weeks at a dose (15 mg/kg) that resulted in AUC-based serum drug concentrations that were over 27-fold higher than that obtained in humans at the recommended dose of 25 mg. 6.

## Package Leaflet: Information for the User

## LIFMIOR 25 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection Etanercept

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

For psoriatic arthritis patients with multiple joint involvement, LIFMIOR can improve your ability to do normal daily activities. For patients with multiple symmetrical painful or swollen joints (e.g., hands, wrists and feet), LIFMIOR can slow down the structural damage to those joints caused by the disease.

Read all (both sides) of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you. · Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. · Your doctor will also give you a Patient Alert Card, which contains important safety information that you need to be aware of before and during treatment with LIFMIOR. · If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. · This medicine has been prescribed for you or a child in your care. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours or those of the child you are caring for. · If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet Information in this leaflet is organised under the following 7 sections: 1. What LIFMIOR is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you use LIFMIOR 3. How to use LIFMIOR 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store LIFMIOR 6. Contents of the pack and other information 7. Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of LIFMIOR (See overleaf) 1. What LIFMIOR is and what it is used for LIFMIOR is a medicine that is made from two human proteins. It blocks the activity of another protein in the body that causes inflammation. LIFMIOR works by reducing the inflammation associated with certain diseases. In adults (aged 18 and over), LIFMIOR can be used for moderate or severe rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , severe axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis, and moderate or severe psoriasis - in each case usually when other widely used treatments have not worked well enough or are not suitable for you. For rheumatoid arthritis, LIFMIOR is usually used in combination with methotrexate, although it may also be used alone if treatment with methotrexate is unsuitable for you. Whether used alone or in combination with methotrexate, LIFMIOR can slow down the damage to your joints caused by the rheumatoid arthritis and improve your ability to do normal daily activities. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

LIFMIOR is also prescribed for the treatment of the following diseases in children and adolescents

- For the following types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis when treatment with methotrexate has not worked well enough or is not suitable for them:
- Polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in patients from the age of 2 years
- Hepatitis B: Tell your doctor if you or the child have or have ever had hepatitis B. Your doctor should test for the presence of hepatitis B infection before you or the child begin treatment with LIFMIOR. Treatment with LIFMIOR may result in reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who have previously been infected with the hepatitis B virus. If this occurs, you should stop using LIFMIOR.

· Psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years · For enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years when other widely used treatments have not worked well enough or are not suitable for them · Severe psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years who have had an inadequate response to (or are unable to take) phototherapies or other systemic therapies. 2. What you need to know before you use LIFMIOR Do not use LIFMIOR · if you, or the child you are caring for, are allergic to etanercept or any of the other ingredients of LIFMIOR (listed in section 6). If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more LIFMIOR, and contact your doctor immediately. · if you or the child have, or are at risk of developing a serious blood infection called sepsis. If you are not sure, please contact your doctor. · if you or the child, have an infection of any kind. If you are not sure, please talk to your doctor. Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor before taking LIFMIOR. · Allergic reactions : If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more LIFMIOR, and contact your doctor immediately. · Infections/surgery : If you or the child develop a new infection, or are about to have any major surgery, your doctor may wish to monitor the treatment with LIFMIOR. · Infections/diabetes: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of recurrent infections or suffer from diabetes or other conditions that increase the risk of infection. · Infections/monitoring: Tell your doctor of any recent travel outside the European region. If you or the child develop symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills or cough, notify your doctor immediately. Your doctor may decide to continue to monitor you or the child for the presence of infections after you or the child stop using LIFMIOR. · Tuberculosis: As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR, your doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting LIFMIOR. This may include a thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of these tests should be recorded on the Patient Alert Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you or the child have ever had tuberculosis, or have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (such as persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell your doctor immediately. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Hepatitis C: Tell your doctor if you or the child have hepatitis C. Your doctor may wish to monitor the treatment with LIFMIOR in case the infection worsens.

· Nervous system and eye disorders: Tell your doctor if you or the child have multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis (inflammation of the nerves of the eyes) or transverse myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord). Your doctor will determine if LIFMIOR is an appropriate treatment. · Congestive heart failure: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of congestive heart failure, because LIFMIOR needs to be used with caution under these circumstances. · Cancer: Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or any other cancer before you are given LIFMIOR. Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may be at higher than average risk of developing lymphoma. Children and adults taking LIFMIOR may have an increased risk of developing lymphoma or another cancer. Some children and teenage patients who have received LIFMIOR or other medicines that work the same way as LIFMIOR have developed cancers, including unusual types, which sometimes resulted in death. Some patients receiving LIFMIOR have developed skin cancers. Tell your doctor if you or the child develop any change in the appearance of the skin or growths on the skin. · Chickenpox: Tell your doctor if you or the child are exposed to chickenpox when using LIFMIOR. Your doctor will determine if preventive treatment for chickenpox is appropriate. · Alcohol abuse : LIFMIOR should not be used for the treatment of hepatitis related to alcohol abuse. Please tell your doctor if you or the child in your care have a history of alcohol abuse. · Wegener's granulomatosis : LIFMIOR is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis, a rare inflammatory disease. If you or the child in your care have Wegener's granulomatosis, talk to your doctor. · Anti-diabetic medicines : Tell your doctor if you or the child have diabetes or are taking medicines to treat diabetes. Your doctor may decide if you or the child need less anti-diabetic medicine while taking LIFMIOR. Children and adolescents · Vaccinations: If possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using LIFMIOR. Some vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given while using LIFMIOR. Please consult your doctor before you or the child receive any vaccines. · Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) : There have been cases of IBD in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) treated with LIFMIOR. Tell the doctor if the child develops any abdominal cramps and pain, diarrhoea, weight loss or blood in the stool. LIFMIOR should not normally be used in children with polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis below the age of 2 years, or in children with enthesitis-related arthritis or psoriatic arthritis below the age of 12 years, or in children with psoriasis below the age of 6 years. Other medicines and LIFMIOR Tell the doctor or pharmacist if you or the child are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines (including anakinra, abatacept or sulfasalazine), even those not prescribed by the doctor. You or the child should not use LIFMIOR with medicines that contain the active substance anakinra or abatacept. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Blood disorders: Seek medical advice immediately if you or the child have any signs or symptoms such as persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding or paleness. Such symptoms may point to the existence of potentially life-threatening blood disorders, which may require discontinuation of LIFMIOR.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

LIFMIOR should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. You should consult your doctor if you become pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby.

If you received LIFMIOR during pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk of getting an infection. In addition, one study found more birth defects when the mother had received LIFMIOR in pregnancy, compared with mothers who had not received LIFMIOR or other similar medicines (TNF-antagonists), but there was no particular kind of birth defect reported. Another study found no increased risk of birth defects when the mother had received LIFMIOR in pregnancy. Your doctor will help you to decide whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk to your baby. It is important that you tell the baby's doctors and other healthcare professionals about the use of LIFMIOR during pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section 2, 'Vaccinations'). Women using LIFMIOR should not breast-feed, since LIFMIOR passes into human breast milk. Driving and using machines The use of LIFMIOR is not expected to affect the ability to drive or use machines. 3. How to use LIFMIOR Always use this medicine exactly as the doctor has told you. Check with the doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. If you feel that the effect of LIFMIOR is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. Dosing for adult patients (aged 18 years or over) Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis The usual dose is 25 mg given twice a week or 50 mg once a week as an injection under the skin. However, your doctor may determine an alternative frequency at which to inject LIFMIOR. Plaque psoriasis The usual dose is 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg once a week. Alternatively, 50 mg may be given twice a week for up to 12 weeks, followed by 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg once a week. Your doctor will decide how long you should take LIFMIOR and whether retreatment is needed based on your response. If LIFMIOR has no effect on your condition after 12 weeks, your doctor may tell you to stop taking this medicine. Use in children and adolescents The appropriate dose and frequency of dosing for the child or adolescent will depend on body weight and disease. The doctor will provide you with detailed directions for preparing and measuring the appropriate dose. Medicinal product no longer authorised

For polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis in patients from the age of 2 years, or enthesitis-related arthritis or psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years, the usual dose is 0.4 mg of LIFMIOR per kg bodyweight (up to a maximum of 25 mg) given twice weekly, or 0.8 mg of LIFMIOR per kg bodyweight (up to a maximum of 50 mg) given once weekly.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years, the usual dose is 0.8 mg of LIFMIOR per kg bodyweight (up to a maximum of 50 mg), and should be given once weekly. If LIFMIOR has no effect on the child's condition after 12 weeks, your doctor may tell you to stop using this medicine.

## 7. Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of LIFMIOR

This section is divided into the following subsections:

- a. Introduction
- b. Setting up for an injection

c. Preparing the LIFMIOR dose for injection d. Adding solvent e. Withdrawing the LIFMIOR solution from the vial f. Placing the needle on the syringe g. Choosing an injection site h. Preparing the injection site and injecting the LIFMIOR solution i. Disposing of supplies a. Introduction The following instructions explain how to prepare and inject LIFMIOR. Please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step. You will be instructed by your doctor or his/her assistant on the techniques of self-injection or on giving an injection to a child. Do not attempt to administer an injection until you are sure that you understand how to prepare and give the injection. This injection should not be mixed with any other medicine. b. Setting up for an injection · Wash your hands thoroughly. · Select a clean well-lit, flat working surface. · The dose tray should contain the items listed below. (If not, don't use the dose tray and consult your pharmacist). Use only the items listed. Do NOT use any other syringe. 1 LIFMIOR vial 1 Pre-filled syringe containing clear, colourless solvent (water for injections) 1 Needle 1 Vial adaptor 2 Alcohol swabs · Inspect the expiry dates on both the vial label and the syringe label. They should not be used after the month and year shown. c. Preparing the LIFMIOR dose for injection · Remove the contents of the tray · Remove the plastic cap from the LIFMIOR vial (see Diagram 1). Do NOT remove the grey stopper or aluminium ring around the top of the vial. Diagram 1 Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Use a new alcohol swab to clean the grey stopper on the LIFMIOR vial. After cleaning, do not touch the stopper with your hands or allow it to touch any surface.
- Remove the paper backing from the vial adaptor package.
- Place the vial upright on a clean, flat surface.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- While still in the plastic package, place the vial adaptor on top of the LIFMIOR vial so that the vial adaptor spike is centered within the raised circle on top of the vial stopper (see Diagram 2).
- Hold the vial firmly on the flat surface with one hand. With the other hand, push STRAIGHT DOWN FIRMLY on the adaptor package until you feel the adaptor spike penetrate the vial stopper and FEEL AND HEAR THE ADAPTOR RIM LOCK INTO PLACE (see Diagram 3). Do NOT push down the adaptor at an angle (see Diagram 4). It is important that the vial adaptor spike completely penetrates the vial stopper.

Diagram 2. Diagram 3. Diagram 4. CORRECT INCORRECT · While holding the vial in one hand, remove the plastic packaging from the vial adaptor (see Diagram 5). Diagram 5. · Remove the protective cover from the syringe tip by breaking the white cap along the perforation. This is done by holding the collar of the white cap while grasping the end of the white cap with the other hand and bending it down and then up until it is broken (see Diagram 6). Do NOT remove the white collar that remains on the syringe . Diagram 6 · Do not use the syringe if this perforation is already broken. Start again with another dose tray. · Holding the glass barrel of the syringe (not the white collar) in one hand, and the vial adaptor (not the vial) in the other, connect the syringe to the vial adaptor by inserting the tip into the opening and turn clockwise until completely secured (see Diagram 7).

Withdrawing the LIFMIOR solution from the vial

<!-- image -->

d. Adding solvent · While holding the vial upright on the flat surface, push the plunger VERY SLOWLY until all the solvent is in the vial. This will help to reduce foaming (lots of bubbles) (see Diagram 8). · Once the solvent is added to the LIFMIOR, the plunger may move up by itself. This is due to air pressure and should not be of concern. Diagram 8 · With the syringe still attached, gently move the vial in circles a few times, to dissolve the powder (see Diagram 9). Do NOT shake the vial. Wait until all the powder dissolves (usually less than 10 minutes). The solution should be clear and colourless to pale yellow or pale brown, with no lumps, flakes, or particles. Some white foam may remain in the vial  this is normal. Do NOT use LIFMIOR if all the powder in the vial is not dissolved within 10 minutes. Start again with another dose tray. Diagram 9 · With the syringe still attached to the vial and vial adaptor, hold the vial upside down at eye level. Push the plunger all the way into the syringe (see Diagram 10). Diagram 10 Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Then, slowly pull the plunger back to draw the liquid into the syringe (see Diagram 11). For adult patients, withdraw the entire volume. For children, remove only the portion of liquid as directed by your child's doctor. After you have withdrawn the LIFMIOR from the vial, you may have some air in the syringe. Do not be concerned, as you will remove the air in a later step.

## Diagram 11

<!-- image -->

- The needle will remain in the long part of the package.

· With the vial held upside down, unscrew the syringe from the vial adaptor by turning it anti-clockwise (see Diagram 12). Diagram 12 · Place the filled syringe on the clean, flat surface. Make sure that the tip does not touch anything. Be careful not to push down on the plunger. (Note: After you have completed these steps, a small amount of liquid may remain in the vial. This is normal.) f. Placing the needle on the syringe · The needle has been placed in a plastic container to keep it sterile. · To open the plastic container, hold the short, wide end in one hand. Place your other hand on the longer portion of the container. · To break the seal, bend the larger end down and then up until broken (see Diagram 13). Diagram 13 · Once the seal has been broken, remove the short, wide end of the plastic container. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- While holding the needle and container in one hand, pick up the syringe and insert the syringe tip into the needle opening.
- Attach the syringe to the needle by turning it clockwise until completely secured (see Diagram 14).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· Remove the needle cover by firmly pulling it straight off the syringe taking care not to touch the needle or allow the needle to touch any surfaces (see Diagram 15). Be careful not to bend or twist the cover during removal to avoid damage to the needle. Diagram 15 · While holding the syringe upright, remove any air bubbles by slowly pushing on the plunger until the air is removed (see Diagram 16). Diagram 16 g. Choosing an injection site · The three recommended injection sites for LIFMIOR include: (1) the front of the middle thighs; (2) the abdomen, except for the 5 cm area right around the navel; and (3) the outer area of the upper arms (see Diagram 17). If you are self injecting, you should not use the outer area of the upper arms. Diagram 17 Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- A different site should be used for each new injection. Each new injection should be given at least 3 cm from an old site. Do NOT inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Avoid areas with scars or stretch marks. (It may be helpful to keep notes on the location of the previous injections.)
- If you or the child have psoriasis, you should try not to inject directly into any raised, thick, red, or scaly skin patches ('psoriasis skin lesions').

<!-- image -->

h. Preparing the injection site and injecting the LIFMIOR solution · Wipe the site where LIFMIOR is to be injected with an alcohol swab, using a circular motion. Do NOT touch this area again before giving the injection. · When the cleaned area of skin has dried, pinch and hold it firmly with one hand. With the other hand, hold the syringe like a pencil. · With a quick, short motion, push the needle all the way into the skin at an angle between 45° and 90° (see Diagram 18). With experience, you will find the angle that is most comfortable for you or the child. Be careful not to push the needle into the skin too slowly, or with great force. Diagram 18 · When the needle is completely inserted into the skin, release the skin that you are holding. With your free hand, hold the syringe near its base to stabilise it. Then push the plunger to inject all of the solution at a slow , steady rate (see Diagram 19). Diagram 19 When the syringe is empty, remove the needle from the skin; being careful to keep it at the same angle it was when it was inserted. Press a cotton ball over the injection site for 10 seconds. Slight bleeding may occur. Do NOT rub the injection site. A bandage is optional. Medicinal product no longer authorised

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects. Read all (both sides) of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you. · Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. · Your doctor will also give you a Patient Alert Card, which contains important safety information that you need to be aware of before and during treatment with LIFMIOR. · If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. · This medicine has been prescribed for you or a child in your care. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours or those of the child you are caring for. · If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet Information in this leaflet is organised under the following 7 sections: 1. What LIFMIOR is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you use LIFMIOR 3. How to use LIFMIOR 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store LIFMIOR 6. Contents of the pack and other information 7. Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of LIFMIOR (See overleaf) 1. What LIFMIOR is and what it is used for LIFMIOR is a medicine that is made from two human proteins. It blocks the activity of another protein in the body that causes inflammation. LIFMIOR works by reducing the inflammation associated with certain diseases. In adults (aged 18 and over), LIFMIOR can be used for moderate or severe rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , severe axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis, and moderate or severe psoriasis - in each case usually when other widely used treatments have not worked well enough or are not suitable for you. For rheumatoid arthritis, LIFMIOR is usually used in combination with methotrexate, although it may also be used alone if treatment with methotrexate is unsuitable for you. Whether used alone or in combination with methotrexate, LIFMIOR can slow down the damage to your joints caused by the rheumatoid arthritis and improve your ability to do normal daily activities. Medicinal product no longer authorised

For psoriatic arthritis patients with multiple joint involvement, LIFMIOR can improve your ability to do normal daily activities. For patients with multiple symmetrical painful or swollen joints (e.g., hands, wrists and feet), LIFMIOR can slow down the structural damage to those joints caused by the disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

LIFMIOR is also prescribed for the treatment of the following diseases in children and adolescents

- For the following types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis when treatment with methotrexate has not worked well enough or is not suitable for them:
- Polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in patients from the age of 2 years
- Hepatitis B: Tell your doctor if you or the child have or have ever had hepatitis B. Your doctor should test for the presence of hepatitis B infection before you or the child begin treatment with LIFMIOR. Treatment with LIFMIOR may result in reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who have previously been infected with the hepatitis B virus. If this occurs, you should stop using LIFMIOR.

· Psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years · For enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years when other widely used treatments have not worked well enough or are not suitable for them · Severe psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years who have had an inadequate response to (or are unable to take) phototherapies or other systemic therapies. 2. What you need to know before you use LIFMIOR Do not use LIFMIOR · if you, or the child you are caring for, are allergic to etanercept or any of the other ingredients of LIFMIOR (listed in section 6). If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more LIFMIOR, and contact your doctor immediately. · if you or the child have, or are at risk of developing a serious blood infection called sepsis. If you are not sure, please contact your doctor. · if you or the child have an infection of any kind. If you are not sure, please talk to your doctor. Warning and precautions Talk to your doctor before taking LIFMIOR. · Allergic reactions : If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more LIFMIOR, and contact your doctor immediately. · Infections/surgery : If you or the child develop a new infection, or are about to have any major surgery, your doctor may wish to monitor the treatment with LIFMIOR. · Infections/diabetes: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of recurrent infections or suffer from diabetes or other conditions that increase the risk of infection. · Infections/monitoring: Tell your doctor of any recent travel outside the European region. If you or the child develop symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills or cough, notify your doctor immediately. Your doctor may decide to continue to monitor you or the child for the presence of infections after you or the child stop using LIFMIOR. · Tuberculosis: As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR, your doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting LIFMIOR. This may include a thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of these tests should be recorded on the Patient Alert Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you or the child have ever had tuberculosis, or have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (such as persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell your doctor immediately. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Hepatitis C: Tell your doctor if you or the child have hepatitis C. Your doctor may wish to monitor the treatment with LIFMIOR in case the infection worsens.

· Nervous system and eye disorders: Tell your doctor if you or the child have multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis (inflammation of the nerves of the eyes) or transverse myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord). Your doctor will determine if LIFMIOR is an appropriate treatment. · Congestive heart failure: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of congestive heart failure, because LIFMIOR needs to be used with caution under these circumstances. · Cancer: Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or any other cancer before you are given LIFMIOR. Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may be at higher than average risk of developing lymphoma. Children and adults taking LIFMIOR may have an increased risk of developing lymphoma or another cancer. Some children and teenage patients who have received LIFMIOR or other medicines that work the same way as LIFMIOR have developed cancers, including unusual types, which sometimes resulted in death. Some patients receiving LIFMIOR have developed skin cancers. Tell your doctor if you or the child develop any change in the appearance of the skin or growths on the skin. · Chickenpox: Tell your doctor if you or the child are exposed to chickenpox when using LIFMIOR. Your doctor will determine if preventive treatment for chickenpox is appropriate. · Latex : The needle cover is made from latex (dry natural rubber). Contact your doctor before using LIFMIOR if the needle cover will be handled by, or LIFMIOR will be given to, someone with a known or possible hypersensitivity (allergy) to latex. · Alcohol abuse : LIFMIOR should not be used for the treatment of hepatitis related to alcohol abuse. Please tell your doctor if you or the child in your care have a history of alcohol abuse. · Wegener's granulomatosis : LIFMIOR is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis, a rare inflammatory disease. If you or the child in your care have Wegener's granulomatosis, talk to your doctor. · Anti-diabetic medicines : Tell your doctor if you or the child have diabetes or are taking medicines to treat diabetes. Your doctor may decide if you or the child need less anti-diabetic medicine while taking LIFMIOR. Children and adolescents · Vaccinations: If possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using LIFMIOR. Some vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given while using LIFMIOR. Please consult your doctor before you or the child receive any vaccines. · Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) : There have been cases of IBD in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) treated with LIFMIOR. Tell the doctor if the child develops any abdominal cramps and pain, diarrhoea, weight loss or blood in the stool. LIFMIOR should not normally be used in children with polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis below the age of 2 years, or in children with enthesitis-related arthritis or psoriatic arthritis below the age of 12 years, or in children with psoriasis below the age of 6 years. Other medicines and LIFMIOR Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Blood disorders: Seek medical advice immediately if you or the child have any signs or symptoms such as persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding or paleness. Such symptoms may point to the existence of potentially life-threatening blood disorders, which may require discontinuation of LIFMIOR.

Tell the doctor or pharmacist if you or the child are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines (including anakinra, abatacept or sulfasalazine), even those not prescribed by the doctor. You or the child should not use LIFMIOR with medicines that contain the active substance anakinra or abatacept.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

LIFMIOR should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. You should consult your doctor if you become pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby.

If you received LIFMIOR during pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk of getting an infection. In addition, one study found more birth defects when the mother had received LIFMIOR in pregnancy, compared with mothers who had not received LIFMIOR or other similar medicines (TNF-antagonists), but there was no particular kind of birth defect reported. Another study found no increased risk of birth defects when the mother had received LIFMIOR in pregnancy. Your doctor will help you to decide whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk to your baby. It is important that you tell the baby's doctors and other healthcare professionals about the use of LIFMIOR during pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section 2, 'Vaccinations').

4. Assemble the additional supplies you will need for your injection. These include the alcohol swab from the LIFMIOR carton and a cotton ball or gauze.

This leaflet was last revised in Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: http://www.ema.europa.eu 7. Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of LIFMIOR This section is divided into the following subsections: Introduction Step 1: Setting up for an injection Step 2: Choosing an injection site Step 3: Injecting the LIFMIOR solution Step 4: Disposing of supplies Introduction The following instructions explain how to prepare and inject LIFMIOR. Please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step. You will be instructed by your doctor or his/her assistant on the techniques of self-injection or on giving an injection to a child. Do not attempt to administer an injection until you are sure that you understand how to prepare and give the injection. The LIFMIOR solution should not be mixed with any other medicine before use. Step 1: Setting up for an injection 1. Select a clean, well-lit, flat working surface. 2. Take the LIFMIOR carton containing the pre-filled syringes out of the refrigerator and place it on the flat work surface. Starting from one of the top corners, pull back the paper cover from the top and sides of the tray. Remove one pre-filled syringe and one alcohol swab and place them on the work surface. Do not shake the pre-filled syringe of LIFMIOR. Fold the paper cover back over the tray and place the carton containing any remaining pre-filled syringes back into the refrigerator. Please see section 5 for instructions on how to store LIFMIOR. If you have any questions about storage, contact your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist for further instructions. 3. You should allow 15 to 30 minutes for the LIFMIOR solution in the syringe to reach room temperature. Do NOT remove the needle cover while allowing it to reach room temperature. Waiting until the solution reaches room temperature may make the injection more comfortable for you. Do not warm LIFMIOR in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water). Medicinal product no longer authorised

5. Wash your hands with soap and warm water.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

6. Inspect the solution in the syringe. It should be clear or slightly opalescent, colourless to pale yellow or pale brown, and may contain small white or almost transparent particles of protein. This appearance is normal for LIFMIOR. Do not use the solution if it is discoloured, cloudy, or if particles other than those described above are present. If you are concerned with the appearance of the solution, then contact your pharmacist for assistance.

## Step 2: Choosing an injection site

1. The three recommended injection sites for LIFMIOR using a pre-filled syringe include: (1) the front of the middle thighs; (2) the abdomen, except for the 5 cm area right around the navel; and (3) the outer area of the upper arms (see Diagram 1). If you are self injecting, you should not use the outer area of the upper arms. Diagram 1 2. A different site should be used for each new injection. Each new injection should be given at least 3 cm from an old site. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Avoid areas with scars or stretch marks. (It may be helpful to keep notes on the location of the previous injections.) 3. If you or the child have psoriasis, you should try not to inject directly into any raised, thick, red, or scaly skin patches ('psoriasis skin lesions'). Step 3: Injecting the LIFMIOR solution 1. Wipe the site where LIFMIOR is to be injected with the alcohol swab, using a circular motion. Do NOT touch this area again before giving the injection. 2. Pick up the pre-filled syringe from the flat work surface. Remove the needle cover by firmly pulling it straight off the syringe (see Diagram 2). Be careful not to bend or twist the cover during removal to avoid damage to the needle. When you remove the needle cover, there may be a drop of liquid at the end of the needle; this is normal. Do not touch the needle or allow it to touch any surface. Do not touch or bump the plunger. Doing so could cause the liquid to leak out. Medicinal product no longer authorised

3. When the cleaned area of skin has dried, pinch and hold it firmly with one hand. With the other hand, hold the syringe like a pencil. 4. With a quick, short motion, push the needle all the way into the skin at an angle between 45° and 90° (see Diagram 3). With experience, you will find the angle that is most comfortable for you or the child. Be careful not to push the needle into the skin too slowly, or with great force. Diagram 3 5. When the needle is completely inserted into the skin, release the skin that you are holding. With your free hand, hold the syringe near its base to stabilise it. Then push the plunger to inject all of the solution at a slow , steady rate (see Diagram 4). Diagram 4 When the syringe is empty, pull the needle out of the skin, being careful to keep it at the same angle as inserted. There may be a little bleeding at the injection site. You can press a cotton ball or gauze over the injection site for 10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. If needed, you may cover the injection site with a bandage.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

LIFMIOR should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. You should consult your doctor if you become pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby.

If you received LIFMIOR during pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk of getting an infection. In addition, one study found more birth defects when the mother had received LIFMIOR in pregnancy, compared with mothers who had not received LIFMIOR or other similar medicines (TNF-antagonists), but there was no particular kind of birth defect reported. Another study found no increased risk of birth defects when the mother had received LIFMIOR in pregnancy. Your doctor will help you to decide whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk to your baby. It is important that you tell the baby's doctors and other healthcare professionals about the use of LIFMIOR during pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section 2, 'Vaccinations'). Women using LIFMIOR should not breast-feed, since LIFMIOR passes into human breast milk. Driving and using machines The use of LIFMIOR is not expected to affect the ability to drive or use machines. 3. How to use LIFMIOR Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.

7. Using the MYCLIC pre-filled pen to inject LIFMIOR This section is divided into the following subsections: Introduction Step 1: Preparing for an LIFMIOR injection Step 2: Choosing an injection site Step 3: Injecting the LIFMIOR solution Step 4: Disposing of the used MYCLIC pen Introduction The instructions below explain how to use the MYCLIC pen to inject LIFMIOR. Please read the instructions carefully, and follow them step by step. Your doctor or nurse will tell you how to inject LIFMIOR. Do not attempt to administer an injection until you are sure that you understand how to use the MYCLIC pen properly. If you have questions about how to inject, please ask your doctor or nurse for help. Step 1: Preparing for an LIFMIOR injection 1. Select a clean, well-lit, flat surface. 2. Gather the items that you will need for your injection, and place them on the chosen surface: a. One MYCLIC pre-filled pen and one alcohol swab (take these from the carton of pens you keep in your refrigerator). Do not shake the pen. One cotton ball or gauze 3. Check the expiry date (month/year) on the pen . If the date has passed, do not use the pen and contact your pharmacist for assistance. Medicinal product no longer authorised

5. Leave the white needle cap in place and wait approximately 15-30 minutes to allow the LIFMIOR solution in the pen to reach room temperature. Waiting until the solution reaches room temperature may make the injection more comfortable for you. Do not warm in any other way. Always leave the pen out of sight and reach of children.

Whilst waiting for the solution in the pen to reach room temperature, read Step 2 (below), and choose an injection site.

<!-- image -->

Step 2: Choosing an injection site (see Diagram 2) 1. The recommended injection site is the middle of the front of the thighs. If you prefer, you may alternatively use the stomach area, but make sure you choose a site at least 5 cm away from the belly button (navel). If someone else is giving you the injection, the outer area of the upper arms may also be used. Diagram 2 2. Each injection should be given at least 3 cm from where you last injected. Do not inject into tender, bruised or hard skin. Avoid scars or stretch marks. (It may be helpful to keep notes on the location of the previous injections.) 3. If you have psoriasis, you should try not to inject directly into any raised, thick, red, or scaly skin. Step 3: Injecting the LIFMIOR solution 1. After waiting approximately 15-30 minutes for the solution in the pen to warm to room temperature, wash your hands with soap and water. 2. Clean the injection site with the alcohol swab using a circular motion, and allow it to dry. Do not touch this area again before injecting. 3. Pick up the pen, and remove the white needle cap by pulling it straight off (see Diagram 3). To avoid damaging the needle inside the pen, do not bend the white needle cap while you are removing it, and do not re-attach it once it has been removed. After removal of the needle cap, you will see a purple needle safety shield extending slightly from the end of the pen. The needle will remain protected inside the pen until the pen is activated. Do not use the pen if it is dropped with the needle cap off. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Purple needle safety shield 4. Lightly pinching the skin around the injection site between the thumb and index finger of your free hand may make the injection easier and more comfortable. 5. Hold the pen at a right angle (90º) to the injection site . Push the open end of the pen firmly against the skin , so that the needle safety shield is pushed completely inside of the pen. A slight depression in the skin will be seen (see Diagram 4). The pen can only be activated when the needle shield is completely pushed inside the pen. Diagram 4 Needle safety shield disappears inside the pen 6. Whilst pushing the pen firmly against the skin to ensure that the needle safety shield is fully depressed inside the pen, press the centre of the green button on top of the pen with your thumb to start the injection (see Diagram 5). On pressing the centre of the button, you will hear a click. Continue to hold the pen firmly against your skin until you hear a second click, or until 10 seconds after the first click (whichever happens first). Note - If you are unable to start the injection as described, press the pen more firmly against your skin, then press the green button again. Medicinal product no longer authorised

7. On hearing the second 'click' (or, if you do not hear a second 'click', after 10 seconds have passed), your injection will be complete (see Diagram 6). You may now lift the pen from your skin (see Diagram 7). As you lift the pen, the purple needle safety shield will automatically extend to cover the needle. Purple needle safety shield extends to cover needle Inspection window will have turned purple 8. The pen's inspection window should now be completely purple, confirming that the dose has been injected correctly (see Diagram 8). If the window is not completely purple, contact your nurse or pharmacist for assistance, since the pen may not have injected the LIFMIOR solution completely. Do not try to use the pen again, and do not try to use another pen without agreement from your nurse or pharmacist. Medicinal product no longer authorised

9. If you notice a spot of blood at the injection site, you should press the cotton ball or gauze over the injection site for 10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. Step 4: Disposing of the used MYCLIC pen · The pen should be used once only - it should never be re-used. Dispose of the used pen as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. Do not attempt to recap the pen. If you have any questions, please talk to a doctor, nurse or pharmacist who is familiar with LIFMIOR. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Do not use LIFMIOR

- if the child you are caring for is allergic to etanercept or any of the other ingredients of LIFMIOR (listed in section 6). If the child experiences allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more LIFMIOR, and contact your doctor immediately.

· if the child has, or is at risk of developing a serious blood infection called sepsis. If you are not sure, please contact your doctor. · if the child has an infection of any kind. If you are not sure, please talk to your doctor. Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor before taking LIFMIOR. · Allergic reactions : If the child experiences allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more LIFMIOR, and contact your doctor immediately. · Infections/surgery: If the child develops a new infection, or is about to have any major surgery, the doctor may wish to monitor the child's treatment with LIFMIOR. · Infections/diabetes: Tell your doctor if the child has a history of recurrent infections, or suffers from diabetes or other conditions that increase the risk of infection. · Infections/monitoring: Tell your doctor of any recent travel outside the European region. If the child develops symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills or cough, notify your doctor immediately. Your doctor may decide to continue to monitor the child for the presence of infections after the child stops using LIFMIOR. · Tuberculosis: As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with LIFMIOR, your doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting LIFMIOR. This may include a thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of these tests should be recorded on the Patient Alert Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if the child has ever had tuberculosis, or has been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (such as persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell your doctor immediately. · Hepatitis B: Tell your doctor if the child has or has ever had hepatitis B. Your doctor should test for the presence of hepatitis B infection before the child begins treatment with LIFMIOR. Treatment with LIFMIOR may result in reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who have previously been infected with the hepatitis B virus. If this occurs, you should stop using LIFMIOR. · Hepatitis C: Tell your doctor if the child has hepatitis C. Your doctor may wish to monitor the treatment with LIFMIOR in case the infection worsens. · Blood disorders: Seek medical advice immediately if the child has any signs or symptoms such as persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding or paleness. Such symptoms may point to the existence of potentially life-threatening blood disorders, which may require discontinuation of LIFMIOR. · Nervous system and eye disorders: Tell your doctor if the child has multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis (inflammation of the nerves of the eyes) or transverse myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord). Your doctor will determine if LIFMIOR is an appropriate treatment. · Congestive heart failure: Tell your doctor if the child has a history of congestive heart failure, because LIFMIOR needs to be used with caution under these circumstances. · Cancer: Tell your doctor if the child has or has ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or any other cancer before the child is given LIFMIOR. Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may be at higher than average risk of developing lymphoma. Children and adults taking LIFMIOR may have an increased risk of developing lymphoma or another cancer. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Some patients receiving LIFMIOR have developed skin cancers. Tell your doctor if the child develops any change in the appearance of the skin or growths on the skin.

· Alcohol abuse : LIFMIOR should not be used for the treatment of hepatitis related to alcohol abuse. Please tell your doctor if the child in your care has a history of alcohol abuse. · Wegener's granulomatosis : LIFMIOR is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis, a rare inflammatory disease.

You should consult your doctor if you become pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby. If you received LIFMIOR during pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk of getting an infection. In addition, one study found more birth defects when the mother had received LIFMIOR in pregnancy, compared with mothers who had not received LIFMIOR or other similar medicines (TNF-antagonists), but there was no particular kind of birth defect reported. Another study found no increased risk of birth defects when the mother had received LIFMIOR in pregnancy. Your doctor will help you to decide whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk to your baby. It is important that you tell the baby's doctors and other healthcare professionals about the use of LIFMIOR during pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section 2, 'Vaccinations').
