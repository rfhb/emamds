## 1. Introduction

On 6 May 2024, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for MenQuadfi, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study MET61 'An immunogenicity and safety study of a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines in healthy infants and toddlers' is part of a clinical development program. The variation application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e. ongoing paediatric clinical studies covering 6 to 12 months population: MET33, MET41, MET42, MET52, MET58, MET61) is expected to be submitted in Q1 2025. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The formulation of the MenACYW vaccine (MenQuadfi) as solution for injection is approved for the active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and older against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria (N.) meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y (as 10 μ g polysaccharides each and with 55 μ g conjugated tetanus toxoid carrier protein).

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

· Study MET61 : An immunogenicity and safety study of a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines in healthy infants and toddlers.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study MET61

## Description

Study MET61 is a Phase III, randomised, parallel group, active-controlled, multi-centre study to compare the immunogenicity and describe the safety of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and Menveo when administered in a 1 + 1 schedule and concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines in healthy infants and toddlers in the US. This study also describes the safety and immunogenicity of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and Menactra when administered in a 1 +1 schedule to healthy toddlers in the US. For each age group at enrolment, the study had a modified double-blind design, i.e., modified doubleblind between Group 1 and Group 2, and between Group 3 and Group 4.

This study was conducted at 47 centres that enrolled and randomised subjects in the US and Puerto Rico.

The study was conducted between 04 October 2018 (first subject first visit) and 23 October 2023 (last subject last contact).

## Sample size

Approximately 870 subjects were to be enrolled in Group 1 and Group 2. An estimated 20% to 30% and not higher than 40% of non-evaluable subjects was to result in at least 522 subjects in the PerProtocol population available for immunogenicity analyses. Group 1 was to have 435 enrolled subjects and 261 evaluable subjects. Group 2 was to have 435 enrolled subjects and 261 evaluable subjects. In addition, 200 subjects were to be enrolled in Group 3 and Group 4.

Primary Objective: Thirty days after the month 12 vaccination (after the second dose vaccination)

With at least 261 evaluable subjects in Group 1 and at least 261 evaluable subjects in Group 2, the study was to have around 90.0% power by using Farrington and Manning's method to declare the noninferiority of Group 1 vs Group 2.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

## Randomisation

On the day of enrolment, subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and whose parent / guardian signs the ICF will be randomly assigned to either Groups 1, 2 or Groups 3, 4 in a 1:1 ratio depending on the age at recruitment. Approximately 870 healthy infants 6 to7 months of age will be randomized 1:1 to either Group 1 or Group 2, and 200 healthy toddlers 17 to 19 months of age will be randomized 1:1 to either Group 3 or Group 4.

Site staff will connect to the IRT system, enter the identification and security information, and confirm a minimal amount of data in response to IRT system prompts. The IRT system will then provide the group assignment and have the site staff confirm it. The full detailed procedures for group allocation are described in the Operating Guidelines. If the subject is not eligible to participate in the study, then the information will only be recorded on the subject recruitment log.

Subject numbers that are assigned by the IRT system will consist of a 12-digit string (a 3-digit country identifier , a 4-digit study centre identifier, and a 5-digit subject identifier). For example, Subject 840000100005 is the fifth subject enrolled in Centre Number 1 in the US (840 being the US country code).

Subject numbers should not be reassigned for any reason. The randomization codes will be kept securely in the IRT system.

## Blinding

Given that the meningococcal vaccines (investigational and control) used in this study had different appearances, preparation methods, and vaccination schedules, the study had a modified double blind design for each group at enrolment, i.e., modified double-blind between Group 1 and Group 2, and between Group 3 and Group 4, and thus, with the exception of the personnel administering the vaccine, everyone involved in study (participants, care provider, investigator, safety outcomes assessor, Sponsor) was blinded to avoid any bias.

The code was permitted to be broken in the event of an AE only when the identification of the vaccine received could influence the treatment of the subject. Code-breaking was to be limited to the subject(s) experiencing the AE.

The blind could be broken by the Investigator or a delegate through the IRT system, as explained in the code-breaking procedures described in the Operating Guidelines. Once the emergency was addressed by the site, the Investigator or a delegate was obligated to notify the Sanofi Pasteur RMO if a subject's code was broken. All contact attempts with the Sponsor prior to unblinding were to be documented in the source documents, and the code breaking CRF was to be completed.

A request for the code to be broken could also be made by the GPV Department through an internal system for reporting to Health authorities in the case of an SAE as described in ICH E2A. In this case,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the code will be broken only for the subject(s) in question. The information resulting from codebreaking (i.e., the subject's vaccine or group assignment) will not be communicated to either the Investigator or the immediate team working on the study, except for the GPV representative.

## Statistical Methods

## Primary objective

Thirty days after receiving MenACYW conjugate vaccine at 12 months of age, the hSBA vaccine seroresponse rates against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W in Group 1 were non- inferior to the corresponding hSBA vaccine seroresponse rates against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W in Group 2. hSBA vaccine seroresponse for serogroups A, C, Y and W was defined as: For a subject with a pre-vaccination titre &lt; 1:8, the post-vacc ination titre should be ≥ 1:16; For a subject with a prevaccination titre ≥ 1:8, the postvaccination titre should be ≥ 4 -fold greater than the prevaccination titre.

- Null hypothesis (H0): p(men, G1) p(men, G2) ≤ -10%
- Alternative hypothesis (H1): p(men, G1) - p(men, G2) &gt; -10%

where p(men, G1) and p(men, G2) were the percentages of subjects who achieved hSBA vaccine seroresponse in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. Each of the serogroups A, C, Y, and W was tested separately. Assuming the difference between the 2 proportions was normally distributed, if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between the 2 proportions was &gt; 10%, the inferiority assumption was rejected. For the non-inferiority hypotheses using the seroresponse rates, the CI of the difference in proportions was computed using the Wilson Score method without continuity correction.

## Secondary objective

Thirty days after receiving MenACYW conjugate vaccine at 12 months of age, the hSBA vaccine seroprotection rates against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W in Group 1 was noninferior to the corresponding hSBA vaccine seroprotection rates against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W in Group 2.

- Null hypothesis (H0): p(men, G1) p(men, G2) ≤ -10%
- Alternative hypothesis (H1): p(men, G1) - p(men, G2) &gt; -10%

where p(men, G1) and p(men, G2) were the percentages of subjects who achieved hSBA vaccine seroprotection ( hSBA vaccine seroprotection for serogroups A, C, Y and W was defined as titres ≥ 1:8 ) in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. Each of the serogroups A, C, Y, and W were tested separately. Assuming the difference between the 2 proportions was normally distributed, if the lower limit of the 2sided 95% CI of the difference between the 2 proportions was &gt; -10%, the inferiority assumption was rejected. The CI of the difference in proportions was computed using the Wilson Score method without continuity correction.

In general, categorical variables were summarized and presented by frequency counts, proportion percentages, and CIs. The 95% CIs of point estimates were calculated using the normal approximation for quantitative data and the exact binomial distribution (Clopper-Pearson method) for proportions. For GMTs and geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), 95% CIs of point estimates were calculated using normal approximation assuming they were log-normally distributed.

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 950 participants were enrolled and randomized in the study: 380 participants were randomized to Group 1, 370 were randomized to Group 2, 96 were randomized to Group 3, and 104 were randomized to Group 4. A total of 298 (78.4%) in group 1, 290 (78.4%) in group 2, 83 (86.5%) in group 3, and 94 (90,4%) in group 4 completed the study. A subject disposition flow chart and a tabular summary of disposition/vaccine allocation for randomised subjects are presented below.

* One participant was randomized with a wrong date ofbirth (at 18 months of age instead of 6-7 months of age) and did not receive any studyintervention

fN vaccinated for MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1) or MENVEO? (Group 2); participants received concomitant routine and 2 received only routine vaccines at Visit 4 (PCV13 + Hib)

↑ Blood sample was applicable at Visit 2 to the first 50% of the participants in Groups 1 and 2 and at Visit 3 only to the participants in Groups 1 and 2 who did not provide a blood sample at Visit 2

$ One participant in Group 2 received the wrong vaccination during this visit (ie, received MenACY W conjugate vaccine instead ofMENVEO*)

parent withdrawal was higher than expected due to COVID-19 pandemic conditions when parents were not ready to come or to retum to research sites.

## Baseline data

A summary of baseline demographics for all randomised subjects is presented in the table below. There were more males than females in Group 1 (200 [52.6%] males and 180 [47.4%] females), and in Group 2 (198 [53.5%] males and 172 [46.5%] females). The perce ntage of males and females was balanced in Group 3 (48 [50.0%] males and 48 [50.0%] females), and in Group 4 (52 [50.0%] males

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and 52 [50.0%] females). The male/female ratio was 1.11 in Group 1, 1.15 in Group 2, 1.00 in Group 3, and 1.00 in Group 4. The mean age (± standard deviation [SD]) of participants at enrolment was 6.01 (± 0.700) months in Group 1, 6.02 (± 0.396) months in Group 2, 17.9 (± 0.632) months in Group 3, and 17.9 (± 0.673) in Group 4.

## Numbers analysed

Definition of the analysis sets:

- -Overall SafAS: subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study vaccines and had any safety data available. All subjects had their safety analysed after any dose according to the vaccine received at the first dose. Safety data recorded for a vaccine received out of the protocol design were excluded from the analysis (and listed separately).
- -SafAS1: subjects who had received the study vaccine at Visit 1 (Groups 1 and 2) around 6-7 months of age and had any safety data available. All subjects had their safety analysed after the Visit 1 dose according to the vaccines they received at Visit 1. Safety data recorded for a vaccine received out of the protocol design at Visit 1 were excluded from the analysis (and listed separately).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -SafAS2: subjects who had received the study vaccine at 12-13 months of age in Groups 1 and 2 at Visit 3 and had any safety data available. All subjects had their safety analysed after this dose according to the vaccines they received at that visit. Safety data recorded for a vaccine received out of the protocol design at that Visit 3 were excluded from the analysis (and listed separately).
- -SafAS3: subjects who had received the study vaccine at Visit 1 at 17-19 months of age in Groups 3 and 4 and had any safety data available. All subjects had their safety analysed after this dose according to the vaccines they received at that visit. Safety data recorded for a vaccine received out of the protocol design at that Visit 1 (Groups 3 and 4) were excluded from the analysis (and listed separately).
- -SafAS4: subjects who had received the study vaccine at Visit 2 (Groups 3 and 4) at 20-23 months of age and had any safety data available. All subjects had their safety analysed after this dose according to the vaccine they received at that visit. Safety data recorded for a vaccine received out of the protocol design at that Visit 2 were excluded from the analysis (and listed separately).
- -F AS1: subset of all randomized subjects who received ≥ 1 dose of the study vaccine in infancy (&lt; 12 months of age) and had a valid post vaccination serology result in infancy. All subjects were analysed according to the treatment group to which they were randomized.
- -FAS2: subset of all randomized subjects who received ≥ 1 dose of the study vaccine in the second year of life (≥ 12 months of age) and had a valid post -vaccination serology result in the second year of life. All subjects were analysed according to the treatment group to which they were randomized.
- -FAS3: subset of all randomized subjects who received ≥ 1 dose of the study vaccine in infancy (&lt; 12 months of age) and had a valid pre-vaccination serology result at Visit 3. All subjects were analysed according to the treatment group to which they were randomized.
- -PPAS1: subset of FAS1 subjects with a valid serology obtained 30 days after the vaccination visit at 6 to 7 months of age (post-vaccination 1) for all antigens and with no relevant protocol deviations.
- -PPAS2: subset of FAS2 with a valid serology obtained 30 days after vaccination during the second year of life and with no relevant protocol deviations.
- -PPAS3: subset of FAS3 with a valid serology obtained at Visit 3 (pre-vaccination 2) for persistence 6 months after infant vaccination and with no relevant protocol deviations.

## Study discontinuation

The discontinuation rate during the study was high. Of the 950 subjects enrolled and randomized, only 765 (80.5%) completed the study: 298 (78.4%) subjects in Group 1, 290 (78.4%) subjects in Group 2, 83 (86.5%) subjects in Group 3, and 94 (90.4%) subjects in Group 4. The reasons for discontinuation are shown in the table below.

This high discontinuation rate was due to high parental/LAR withdrawal rate. The main reasons for the parental/LAR withdrawals were not specified (no reasons were provided) or were motivated by concerns regarding blood sampling (number of blood sampling during the study and/or after one or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

more unsuccessful blood sampling attempts), or were related to the fact that the parents finally choose regular vaccines, or to reasons relative to the COVID-19 pandemic situation and its impact on people's mobility as some parents were unable to come to research sites. Less than 10% of subjects were directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic situation.

## Efficacy results

## Primary Immunogenicity Endpoint

The primary objective was to demonstrate the NI of the vaccine seroresponse rate to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W following sequential administration of 2 doses of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1) compared to 2 doses of MENVEO (Group 2) when given concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines to infants and toddlers 6 to 7 months of age and 12 to 13 months of age.

The primary objective was met. At D30 after the second vaccination at 12 to 13 months of age, the NI of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1) compared to MENVEO (Group 2) was demonstrated in the PPAS2 as the lower limit of the 95% CI of the difference in the proportion of subjects with an hSBA seroresponse for meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y was greater than -10%.

The NI of hSBA vaccine seroresponse rate 30 days after the second dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 1) or MENVEO (Group 2) in the PPAS2 is presented below. The NI was also demonstrated in the FAS2.

## Adverse Events of Special Interest

A total of 6 AESIs were reported for 5 subjects during the study. All AESIs were recorded as febrile convulsions according to the MedDRA derived term. The events were reported as febrile seizure for 5 subjects and as febrile convulsions for 1 subject (1 subject in Group 4 experienced 2 AESIs, 1 reported as febrile seizure and the other as febrile convulsions). Febrile seizure was reported for 1 subject in Group 1 (that occurred 119 days after the first vaccination), 2 subjects in Group 2 (1 event occurred 90 days after the first vaccination and the other 97 days after the second vaccination), no subject in Group 3, and 2 subjects in Group 4 (both events occurred 53 days after the first vaccination). None of these AESIs were assessed as related to the study vaccine. One case of Grade 3 febrile convulsions was reported for 1 subject in Group 4 which occurred on Day 1 after the first vaccination with Menactra. This AESI was assessed as related to the study vaccine by the Investigator and the Sponsor.

## Other Significant Adverse Events

During the study, there were 252 (68.1%) subjects who reported 1225 MAAEs in Group 1, 249 (69.0%) subjects who reported 1387 MAAEs in Group 2, 61 (63.5%) subjects who reported 238 MAAEs in Group 3, and 64 (62.1%) subjects who reported 258 MAAEs in Group 4. Within 30 days of any vaccination, there were 136 (36.8%) subjects who reported 245 MAAEs in Group 1, 117 (32.4%) subjects who reported 222 MAAEs in Group 2, 28 (29.2%) subjects who reported 67 MAAEs in Group 3, and 28 (27.2%) subjects who reported 53 MAAEs in Group 4.

There was no related MAAE reported in Group 2, Group 3, and Group 4. During the study, a total of 11 (3.0%; 15 events) subjects in Group 1, 18 (5.0%; 20 events) in Group 2, 4 (4.2%, 4 events) in Group 3, and 7 (6.8%, 9 events) in Group 4 reported at least 1 Grade 3 MAAE. None was related to study vaccines. A total of 3 (0.8%; 4 events) subjects in Group 1, 5 (1.4%, 5 events) in Group 2, 3 (3.1%, 3 events) in Group 3, and 4 (3.9%, 5 events) reported at least 1 Grade 3 MAAE within 30 days of any vaccination.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

## Background

MenACYW (MenQuadfi) is authorised in the EU to protect adults and children from the age of 12 months against invasive meningococcal disease caused by four groups of the Neisseria meningitidis bacteria (group A, C, W, and Y).

MET61 was a phase III, modified double-blind, randomized parallel group, active-controlled, multi centre immunogenicity and safety study to compare the immunogenicity and describe the safety of MenACYW and Menveo when administered in a 1 + 1 schedule administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines in healthy infants and toddlers in the US.  Additionally, this study described safety and immunogenicity of MenACYW compared to Menactra, when administered in a 1 + 1 schedule to healthy toddlers in the US. The study report of MET61 was submitted within 6 months of study completion as required under Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, as amended. This study is part of a data package of 5 clinical studies covering individuals 6 to 12 months of age (MET33, MET41,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

MET42, MET52, MET58, MET61). The Applicant intends to submit this package in Q1 2025 in a type II variation. Currently, no SmPC changes are foreseen. This approach is acceptable.

Key issues identified are described below and are expected to be addressed by the MAH as part of the type II variation.

## Study design &amp; conduct

In MET61, healthy infants received either MenACYW (Group 1) or Menveo (Group 2) concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines at 6 to 7, and 12 to 13 months of age, and healthy toddlers received either MenACYW (Group 3) or Menactra (Group 4) at 17 to 19, and 20 to 23 months of age. Concomitant vaccines were diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), inactivated poliovirus (IPV), Haemophilus influenzae type b (if not immunized with PedvaxHIV at 2 and 4 months of age), Rotavirus (RotaTeq), and Hepatitis B at 6 months of age; at 6 and 13 months, participants received pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine (Prevnar 13); and at 12 months of age, participants received measles, mumps, and rubella (M-M-R II), and Varicella (Varivax).

In- and exclusion criteria (related to age, vaccination history, immunodeficiency, etc.) adequately define the study population of interest.

Efficacy and safety of Menveo have not been established in children &lt;2 years of age, and Menactra is not authorized in the EU. Therefore, the use of Menveo and Menactra as comparators should be discussed at the planned type II variation. MET61 did not include non-concomitant comparator groups (e.g. receiving only MenACYW or only other paediatric vaccines), which needs to be taken into account for all results (immunogenicity and safety). At the time of the type II variation it is expected that the MAH will provide data from their paediatric development program to demonstrate that concomitant vs. separate MenACYW vaccination does not negatively impact on immunogenicity (of MenACYW and concomitant vaccines) and safety. Furthermore, the MAH should justify and contextualize the used concomitant vaccines and schedule with the European situation (i.e. available vaccines and recommended vaccination schedules).

A total of 950 participants were randomised in the study: 380 to Group 1, 370 to Group 2, 96 to Group 3 and 104 to Group 4. A slightly larger proportion of subjects in groups 1 and 2 were male than female, although the proportions were balanced between the compared groups and therefore, this is not considered problematic. Baseline demographics were generally well balanced between Group 1 and 2, and between 3 and 4 with regards to age, racial origin, and ethnicity.

A total of 765 (80.5%) participants completed the study: 298 (78.4%) subjects in Group 1, 290 (78.4%) subjects in Group 2, 83 (86.5%) subjects in Group 3, and 94 (90.4%) subjects in Group 4. The proportions of patients who received study drug, concomitant vaccines, and finished the study were similar between groups 1 and 2. Overall, the proportions of patients exposed to the respective vaccines at the respective time points are considered comparable and discontinuation rates/ failure to provide blood samples are not unexpected given the paediatric population.

Blood samples for immunogenicity were drawn in all participants at baseline, and 30 days after the second vaccination. Additionally, in Group 1 and 2, 50% of patients provided blood samples 30 days after the first dose of study drug and the remaining 50% provided a blood sample before the second vaccination. This is considered appropriate to characterise the (short-term) humoral immune response.

The assessment of comparability of MenACYW, Menveo and Menactra is hampered by the lack of discussion of the impact of major protocol deviations and the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the proportion of subjects with at least one major protocol deviation was similar between respective treatment groups (67.9%, 69.2%, 43.8%, 42.3% of subjects in Group 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively), this is considered to be very high overall. Originally, the sample size was planned to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

result in 522 evaluable subjects in the PP set for Group 1 and Group 2, which turned out to be only 343. The largest part of these major protocol deviations consisted of missed samples, samples outside the protocol-specified time window and failure to receive IMP or co-administered vaccine. A total of 35 subjects in Group 1, 36 subjects in Group 2, 6 subjects in Group 3, and 5 subjects in Group 4 were impacted directly by COVID-19, with the non-direct impact of COVID-19 on immunogenicity and safety in general not being discussed by the applicant. The lack of discussion of the impact of the large number of major protocol deviations leading to exclusion from the PP set is considered to be concerning. It is unclear how much the larger than anticipated number of non-evaluable subjects could have affected the study integrity and to what degree corresponding results address a relevant target of estimation. At the time of the intended type II variation, the Applicant is asked to clarify the estimand intended by the study, together with definitions of  intercurrent events, their handling in the statistical analysis and conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the study results with respect to deviations from assumptions made in the statistical analysis.

## Immunogenicity

The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of the vaccine seroresponse to meningococcal serogroups A,C, Y, W following the sequential administration of 2 doses of MenACYW (Group1) compared to Menveo (Group 2) as measured with hSBA. Seroresponse success was dependent on pre-vaccination titres: for a participant with a pre-vaccination titre &lt; 1:8, the postvaccination titre should be ≥ 1:16 and for a participant with a pre -vaccination titre ≥ 1:8, the post -vaccination titre should be ≥ 4 -fold greater than the pre-vaccination titre. This is acceptable, as titre baseline values are considered and do not distort findings. Non-inferiority was to be determined, if the lower limit of the 95% CI of the difference in the proportion of participants with an hSBA seroresponse rate for meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y was greater than -10%. This condition was met for the PPAS2 and the FAS2, which supports non-inferiority of MenACYW compared to Menveo. GMTs at baseline against all 4 serogroups were comparable between all 4 study groups. For individuals 6-7 months of age at baseline, 30 days post-dose 2, GMTs were 1.5-4.6 times higher for MenACYW vaccinated individuals (Group 1) compared to those receiving Menveo (Group 2), with the proportion of subjects with a positive seroresponse being higher for serogroups A and W for MenACYW than Menveo (89.4% vs. 82.9% and 99.3% vs. 92.9%) in the PPAS2. Similarly, for individuals 12-13 months of age at baseline, 30 days post-dose 2, GMTs against all 4 serogroups were 3.4-29.1 times higher in MenACYW vaccinated individuals (Group 3) compared to Menactra (Group 4).

The secondary immunogenicity objectives (including e.g. NI of the percentage of subjects with hSBA titres ≥1:8 and antibody response against meningococcal serogroups 30 days after first, and second vaccination in both age groups) evaluated in trial MET61 are overall considered to be supportive of the primary objective. Overall, it can be concluded from MET61 that humoral immune responses induced by MenACYW are non-inferior as induced by Menveo in the setting of concomitant vaccination with other childhood vaccines.

Importantly, however, immunogenicity was only evaluated for meningococcal vaccines (MenACYW, Menveo, and Menactra), but not for concomitant vaccines. Therefore, from study MET61 it is unclear if MenACYW interferes with immune responses generated by concomitant vaccines. At the time of the intended paediatric type II variation, the Applicant needs to demonstrate that concomitant vaccination with MenACYW and routinely used childhood vaccines does not negatively impact on immunogenicity of the latter.

## Safety

Safety data were presented descriptively for the overall safety set SafAS. The SafAS included a total of 930 individuals, 370 subjects in Group, 361 subjects in Group 2 and 96 subjects in Group 3 and 103

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects in Group 4. Additionally, subjects receiving dose 1 and 2 in the two age groups were included in separate safety sets. SafAS1 included subjects receiving dose 1 at 6 to 7 months and SafAS2 included subjects receiving dose 2 at 12 to 13 months of age (Group 1 and 2), while SafAS3 included subjects receiving dose 1 at 17 to 19 months and SafAS4 included subjects receiving dose 2 at 20 to 23 months of age (Group 3 and 4).

Immediate unsolicited systemic adverse events (AEs) were collected within 30 minutes after each vaccination. Solicited AE information for both solicited injection site reactions and solicited systemic reactions was collected from D0 up to D07 after each vaccination; unsolicited AE information was collected from D0 up to D30 after each vaccination; serious adverse event (SAE) information (including AESIs and MAAEs) was collected throughout the study from Visit 1 (day of first vaccination) until the end of the 6-month follow-up period after the last vaccination. This is considered appropriate. In the SafAS 71.1-74.7% of subjects experienced a solicited reaction after any vaccine injection across Groups 1-4. The proportion of subjects with Grade 3 solicited reactions was comparable between Group 1 and 2 (12.4% vs. 9.9%) and between Group 3 and 4 (4.4% vs. 7.0%). Overall, injection site reactions such as swelling or erythema were similar between Groups 1 and 2 (63.5% vs. 61.7%), and higher for Group 3 compared to Group 4 (57.1% vs. 48.0%).  At the site of injection of the concomitant vaccines, a comparable number of injection site reactions were observed overall (63.5%, 61.7%), although the incidence was numerically higher in Group 1 than Group 2 for Pentacel (44.1% vs. 38.7%) and ENGERIX-B or Recombinax HB (35.9% vs. 30.3%). Injection site reactions of Grade 3 were observed for a similar proportion of subjects for Group 1 and 2 (5.9% vs. 5.3%), while between Groups 3 and 4 only 1 event occurred in Group 4 (1%) compared to none in Group 3.

At least one unsolicited AE within 30 days of vaccination was reported in a numerically higher proportion of subjects in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (49.2% vs. 42.7%) while for Groups 3 and 4 it was similar (37.5% vs. 35.9%). The proportion of subjects with unsolicited non-serious systemic AEs was higher in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (47.6% and 41.6%) and slightly higher for Group 3 compared to Group 4 (36.5% vs 33.0%). The proportion of subjects with at least one non-serious AR was similar between all 4 treatment groups (3%, 2.5%, 3.1%, 3.9% for Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively).

The proportion of subjects who experienced at least one SAE was overall comparable between the treatment groups (1.6%, 3.3%, 1.0%, and 3.9% for Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). None of the SAEs observed in the study (including e.g. acute myeloid leukaemia, bronchiolitis, febrile seizure) was considered related to MenACYW. A total of 6 AESIs were reported for 5 subjects during the study, all of which were recorded as febrile convulsions. There was 1 (0.3%) subject in Group 1, 2 (0.6%) and subjects in Group 2, who experienced one AESI each and 2 (1.9%) subjects in Group 4 who experienced 3 AESIs. In Group 4, one subject had febrile convulsion on day 1 after the first dose of Menactra, which was considered related to IP. All seizures that were considered unrelated occurred at least 50 days after injection. Therefore, no timely relationship with MenACYW vaccination becomes immediately apparent. The proportion of subjects who experienced at least 1 MAAE was similar between the respective groups (36.8%, 32.4%, 29.2%, and 27.2% in Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). Only one subject in the Menveo group reported an AE leading to study continuation (acute myeloid leukaemia) 5 days after the first visit, which was considered as unrelated to study vaccine, and no deaths were reported during the study. No deaths occurred.

Overall, no safety findings that would be considered of concern became apparent in the setting of concomitant administration of routinely used paediatric vaccines and MenACYW vs. Menveo or Menactra.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

The presented immunogenicity results from study MET61 are generally considered to be supportive of non-inferiority of MenACYW compared to Menveo in the setting of concomitant administration with routinely used paediatric vaccines. No concerning safety findings became apparent.

However, the following issues were identified that will need to be addressed as part of the paediatric development program for the planned type II variation:

1. The lack of discussion of the impact of the large number of major protocol deviations leading to exclusion from the PP set is considered to be concerning. It is unclear how much the larger than anticipated number of non-evaluable subjects could have affected the study integrity and to what degree corresponding results address a relevant target of estimation. The Applicant is asked to clarify the estimand intended by the study, together with definitions of intercurrent events, their handling in the statistical analysis and conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the study results with respect to deviations from assumptions made in the statistical analysis.
2. Efficacy and safety of Menveo have not been established in children &lt;2 years of age, and Menactra is not authorised in the EU. Therefore, the use of Menveo and Menactra as comparators and applicability of this comparison to EU should be discussed.
3. No non-concomitant vaccination group was included in MET61, thus no comparisons of administration of MenACYW vs. MenACYW + routine childhood vaccines can be made. Further data and/or justifications are required. Furthermore, the MAH should justify and contextualize the used concomitant vaccines and schedule with the European situation (i.e. available vaccines and recommended vaccination schedules).
4. The influence of MenACYW on humoral immune responses of concomitantly administered routine childhood vaccines was not investigated. It needs to de demonstrated that immune responses of the latter are not compromised in the concomitant setting.
