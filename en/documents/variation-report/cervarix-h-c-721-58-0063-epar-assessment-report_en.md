## 1. RECOMMENDATION

Based on the review of the paediatric data on safety and immunogenicity collected in studies HPV-030 Month 12, HPV-025 Month 72, HPV-048 (Months 18, 24 and 36) as well as in study HPV-058 the Rapporteur considers that the benefit-risk balance for the above mentioned product remains unchanged and therefore does not require further regulatory action on the marketing authorisation for Cervarix. The SmPC and PIL remain unchanged.

The Company is requested to submit the Month 12 interim analysis of study HPV-040, as well as the results of study HPV-100, in due time (see Background information below).

For study HPV-025, follow-up data up to Month 120 are needed to fulfil FUM019. For study HPV-048, the final report at Month 60 is needed to fulfil commitment FUM021.

## 2. BACKGROUND

According to Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006, the Company hereby submits to the EMA the clinical study reports for the following paediatric studies: HPV-030 Month 12, HPV-025 Month 72, HPV-048 (Months 18, 24 and 36) as well as HPV-058 .

The applicant states that, in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for the above mentioned product and therefore do not require taking further regulatory action on the marketing authorisation for Cervarix.

The Company is also taking the opportunity to inform the EMA that there is a delay for the submission of the following HPV studies according to Article 46 regulation:

- HPV-040 Interim analysis at Month 12 to evaluate the immunogenicity in all subjects
- HPV-100 Post-Marketing Study (PMS) in the Philippines
- HPV-025 EXT 013 Interim Analysis at Month 84 (Year 7) to evaluate the long-term immunogenicity and safety.

## HPV-040 interim analysis at Month 12 to evaluate immunogenicity in all subjects

Last Subject Last Visit: 20 April 2011

The last subject completed the Month 12 visit on 20 April 2011, the Company had to wait until November 2011 for the download of registry data (Hilmo, Finland). With more than 32,000 enrolled subjects and the complicated study design it was not feasible to perform all analysis-related activities such as data cleaning, investigator's review on medical records of each potential immune-mediated disease (pIMD) case and investigator's signature in clinical database for each individual subject's Case Report Form (CRF). A commitment is made to the EMEA (FUM034) for this interim analysis with submission due date of December 2012 and for the final analysis with submission due date of June 2015.

Currently planned completion date of study report: October 2012

## HPV-100 Post-marketing Study (PMS) in the Philippines

Last Subject Last Visit: 02August 2011

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This study was prematurely terminated, after which the Clinical Trial Assistants faced difficulties in getting all required information for completing the Case Report Forms (CRFs) from the principal investigator. Completion of the last CRF information is expected by the end of May 2012. The cleaning of the clinical database is ongoing.

Currently planned completion date of study report: October 2012

HPV-025 EXT 013 interim analysis at Month 84 (Year 7) to evaluate long-term immunogenicity and safety

Last Subject Last Visit: 20 January 2012

Since the Company considered that the Article 46 legislation was applicable to the submission of the study report within 6 months after LSLV of each study and not within 6 months after LSLV of each study epoch, and the HPV-025 EXT 013 interim analyses at Months 72, 84, 96 and 108 were not requested to be submitted to the EMEA, the Company previously did not track the submission of the HPV-025 EXT 013 interim analysis at Month 84 as an Article 46 submission. There was only a commitment made to the EMEA to submit the first HPV-025 EXT 013 interim analysis at Month 60 (done in December 2010) and the HPV-025 EXT 013 final analysis at Month 120 with due date of December 2015.

Currently planned completion date of study report: September 2012

## 3. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## Study HPV-030 Month 12

The HPV-030 PRI Report dated 17 June 2010 was previously submitted as a type II variation (II-19). The newly submitted Annex Report 1 supplements the report dated 17 June 2010 with safety results reported during Month 7 till Month 12 and during the entire study period (Month 0 till Month 12).

- Occurrence of any, Grade 3 and causally related to vaccination SAEs in all groups throughout the ESFU phase and during the entire study period.
- Occurrence of medically significant conditions in all groups throughout the throughout the ESFU phase and during the entire study period regardless of causal relationship to vaccination and intensity.

It was concluded that in 9-15 year old girls, Cervarix and the GSK Biologicals' hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix) appeared to be generally well tolerated up to six months after the last vaccine dose when given alone or when co-administered with Engerix.

## Study HPV-025 Month 72

Study HPV-025 EXT 013 is a long-term follow-up of the primary Study HPV-013 to extend the total duration of the study up to 10 years to assess persistence of immunogenicity (including any indication of waning immunity) and long-term follow-up safety as was requested by the CHMP (commitment FUM019). Annual interim analyses at Months 60, 72, 84, 96 and 108 are foreseen. The submission of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the final analysis at Month 120 (Year 10) to fulfil the commitment is currently planned in August 2015. No vaccine was administered in Study HPV-025 EXT 013, and only subjects who were included in the immunogenicity subset and received three doses of Cervarix in study HPV -013 and participated in the HPV-013 extension studies HPV-013 Ext M18, M24, M36 and M48 were eligible to participate in Study HPV-025. Subjects who did/do not participate at a particular persistence time point in study HPV- 025 EXT-013 might still be eligible to be included/continue at later time points.

The HPV-013 Final Report (Month 7) and Annex Reports (Months 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48) were previously submitted as FUM019, FUM019.1 and FUM019.2. The HPV-025 EXT 013 Interim Report (M60) dated 11 October 2010 was previously submitted to fulfil the commitment FUM019.3 on 14 December 2010. Table 8 and Table 9 below show the seropositivity rates and GMTs by prevaccination status. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the kinetics of HPV-16 antibodies and HPV-18 for subjects seronegative for at pre-vaccination. It can be concluded that the immunogenicity was sustained up to 72 months among pre-teen and adolescent females vaccinated in study HPV-013 both in terms of antiHPV-16/18 GMTs and seropositivity rates with an acceptable safety profile.

## Assessor's comment

The safety data from study HPV-025 are not shown here since none of the serious adverse events that occurred among 74 subjects were considered as being related to vaccination. The MAH is expected  to  submit  the  final  study  results  to  fulfil  commitment  019  in  due  time  (expected  in August 2015).

## Study HPV-048

The HPV-048 PRI study report M7 and Annex Report MI2 were previously submitted in order to fulfill the commitments FUM021, 021.1 and 021.2. The Annex Reports 2 (MI8), 3 (M24) and 4 (M36) are now submitted. Study HPV-48 PRI is still ongoing and 2 more study visits at Months 48 and 60 are foreseen. The submission of the final report at Month 60 to fulfil commitment FUM021 is currently planned in October 2013.

From the results reported at M18, M24 and M36 it is concluded that in all age groups (9-25 years) a sustained immune response against both HPV-16 and HPV-18 antigens was observed in all vaccine groups up to 36 months after the first vaccination. Cervarix was generally well tolerated. Table 19 and Table 20 show seropositivity rates and GMTs by pre-vaccination status. Table 21 and Table 22 show seropositivity rates and GMTs by pre-vaccination status and by age stratum (strata: 9-14, 15-19, 2025 years).

## Assessor's comment

In study HPV-048, during the follow-up period from Month 24 to Month 36, 63 subjects reported at  least  one  medically  significant  condition  (MSC),  6  subjects  reported  at  least  one  new  onset chronic disease (NOCD), 5 subjects reported at least one new onset autoimmune disease (NOAD) and 14 subjects at least one serious adverse event (SAE). A sustained immune response against both HPV-16 and HPV-18 antigens was observed in all vaccine groups up to 36 months after the first vaccination.

## Study HPV-058

Study HPV058 was a phase III, randomized, double-blind, single centre study in healthy preadolescent and adolescent Chinese females aged 9-17 years. This study was conducted in one single study centre in China. A total of 750 subjects were randomized (1: 1) and allocated to two treatment groups: 374 subjects received Cervarix (HPV group) and 376 subjects received a control (AI[OHh, control group), all according to a Month 0, 1, 6 schedule. The duration of the study was approximately 12 months for each subject. A total of 709 subjects were included in the extended safety follow-up (ESFU) phase of Study HPV-058: 359 and 350 subjects in the HPV and control groups, respectively. Enrolment was age stratified 9-11 year, 12-14 year, 15-17 year). The primary objective was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response one month post-dose 3 for all subjects included in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity versus Chinese women aged 18-25 years old, enrolled in study HPV039. The objective was considered to be reached if for each HPV antigen the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the geometric mean titre (GMT) ratio (GMTs in subjects aged 18-25 years with immunogenicity results at Month 7 who receive Cervarix in the HPV-039 study divided by the GMTs of subjects aged 9-17 years who receive Cervarix in the HPV-058 study) was below 2. Secondary objectives were seroconversion rates to HPV-16 and HPV-18 as assessed by ELISA at Month 7 as well as safety and reactogenicity in Cervarix recipients and the control group after each dose as well as throughout the study period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study results

## Immunogenicity

Table 32 shows the non-inferiority assessment of the immune response (study HPV058 versus study HPV039) in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity.

Assessor's note: the primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of HPV immune response at one month post-dose 3 in Chinese female subjects aged 9-17 years from the current study versus Chinese women aged 18-25 years enrolled in study HPV-039 that was conducted at 4 different areas in China. Non-inferiority (one month after the third vaccine dose) was considered to be reached if for each HPV antigen, the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the GMT ratio in subjects aged 18-25 years study HPV-039 divided by the GMTs of subjects aged 9-17 years in study HPV-058 was below 2.

The primary objective of the study was met: No confirmatory analysis was performed on the secondary objectives.

## Safety

Assessor's note: the solicited and unsolicited symptoms are described in the Clinical Study Report for study HPV-058 up to Month 12 and not represented here.

The percentage of subjects for whom at least one unsolicited symptom was reported during the 30 day post-vaccination follow-up period was 37.2% (95% CI: 32.3%; 42.3%) of subjects in the HPV group and 33.2% (95% CI: 28.5%; 38.3%) of subjects in the control group. No fatal SAEs were reported throughout the study period (Month 0 to Month 12). The percentage of subjects for whom at least one SAE was reported during the entire study period (Month 0 to Month 12) was 1.3% (95% CI: 0.4%; 3.1%) of subjects in the HPV group and 0.5% (95% CI: 0.1%; 1.9%) of subjects in the control group. None of these SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to vaccination.

## 4. MAH'S OVERALL CONCLUSION

The data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for Cervarix. No further regulatory action is required.

## 5. RAPPORTEUR's CONCLUSION

The MAH's conclusion is endorsed.

## 6. REQUEST FOR SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

The MAH is requested to submit the full clinical study report of study HPV039 (only the synopsis of the Interim Report at Month 7 is available in the PSUR Full Report dated 11 January 2011 p. 987-995).
