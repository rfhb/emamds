## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis.

## Treatment monitoring

During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.

## Posology

The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition.

The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or preferably in International Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).

One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.

## On demand treatment

The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is determined using the following formula:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5

The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those calculated using the formula may be necessary.

In case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table (Table 1) can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

Table 1. Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery

| Degree of haemorrhage/type of surgical procedure                   | Factor VIII level required (% or IU/dl)   | Frequency of doses (hours)/duration of therapy (days)                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Haemorrhage Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or oral bleeding. | 20 - 40                                   | Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours (8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6) for at least 1 day, until the bleeding episode, as indicated by pain, is resolved or healing is achieved.                                |
| More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or haematoma.        | 30 - 60                                   | Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours (8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6) for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved.                                                                     |

## Prophylaxis

For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.

## Paediatric population

For on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult patients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Method of administration

Intravenous use. In case of administration by a non-healthcare professional appropriate training is needed.

The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum of 10 ml/min.

For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Known allergic reaction to mouse or hamster protein.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity

Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis.

In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.

## Inhibitors

The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 50 exposure days but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon.

The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre posing less of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.

In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors.

## Cardiovascular events

In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with factor VIII may increase the cardiovascular risk.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Catheter-related complications

If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including local infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.

## Excipient related considerations

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains 10 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.5% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.

It is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the medicinal product.

## Paediatric population

The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interactions of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have been reported.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

ADVATE has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Clinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE reporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency were development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever.

Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed rarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock).

Development of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions may be observed.

Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated with factor VIII, including with ADVATE (see section 5.1). If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.

- a) Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418) in clinical trials, except for adverse reactions identified in post-marketing surveillance marked with * .
- b) Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe haemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients.
- c) ADR explained in the section below.
- d) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (post-operative days 10-14). Haemostasis was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to appropriate levels by post-operative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## ADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process

Of the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell protein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or transient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients reported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst repeated exposures to the study product.

## Hypersensitivity

Allergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paraesthesia, rash, flushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus.

## Paediatric population

Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults. Other than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and catheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02.

## Mechanism of action

ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII glycoprotein found in human plasma. Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2 332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass of 280 kD.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von Willebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII binds to endogenous von Willebrand factor in the patient's circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as results of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.

Of note, annualized bleeding rate (ABR) is not comparable between different factor concentrates and between different clinical studies.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

Data on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within a sub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart review was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective registry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed ITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved.

In study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an individualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen (20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ± 6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to a specific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval of 72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are comparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with ADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) in 'Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII' and 'treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)' (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay.

A total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII &lt; 1%) provided pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters that were included in the per-protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 month to &lt; 2 years of age), children (2 to &lt; 5 years of age), older children (5 to &lt; 12 years of age), adolescents (12 to &lt; 18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize PK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion.

a Calculated as (Cmax - baseline factor VIII) divided by the dose in IU/kg, where Cmax is the maximal post-infusion factor VIII measurement.

## Paediatric population

The safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of adult patients. Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 20% lower in young children (less than 6 years of age) than in adults, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients.

Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute toxicology, repeated dose toxicity, local toxicity and genotoxicity.

## Administration

## Use aseptic technique

Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected for particulate matter prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Only a clear and colourless solution should be used.

1. Remove the blue cap from BAXJECT II / BAXJECT III. Do not draw air into the syringe . Connect the syringe to BAXJECT II / BAXJECT III.
2. Invert the system (the vial with the reconstituted solution has to be on top). Draw the reconstituted solution into the syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly.
3. Disconnect the syringe.
4. Attach a butterfly needle to the syringe. Inject intravenously. The solution should be administered slowly, at a rate as determined by the patient's comfort level, not to exceed 10 ml per minute. The pulse rate should be determined before and during administration of ADVATE. Should a significant increase occur, reducing the rate of administration or temporarily interrupting the injection usually allows the symptoms to disappear promptly (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis.

## Treatment monitoring

During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.

## Posology

The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition.

The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or preferably in International Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).

One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.

## On demand treatment

The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is determined using the following formula:

Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5

The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those calculated using the formula may be necessary.

In case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table (Table 1) can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 1. Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery

## Prophylaxis

For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.

## Paediatric population

For on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult patients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy.

## Method of administration

Intravenous use. In case of administration by a non-healthcare professional appropriate training is needed.

The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum of 10 ml/min.

For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity

Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis.

In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.

Due to the decrease in injection volume for ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml sterilised water for injections, if hypersensitivity reactions occur there is less time to react by stopping the injection. Therefore, caution is advised during injection of ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml sterilised water for injections, especially in children.

## Inhibitors

The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 50 exposure days but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon.

The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre posing less of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.

In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors.

## Misapplication of ADVATE

For ADVATE reconstituted with 2 ml sterilised water for injections, misapplication (intra-arterially or paravenously) may lead to mild, short term injection site reactions, such as bruising and erythema.

## Cardiovascular events

In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with factor VIII may increase the cardiovascular risk.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Catheter-related complications

If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including local infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.

## Excipient related considerations

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains 10 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.5% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.

It is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the medicinal product.

## Paediatric population

The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interactions of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have been reported.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

ADVATE has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Clinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE reporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency were development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever.

Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed rarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock).

Development of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions may be observed.

Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated with factor VIII, including with ADVATE (see section 5.1). If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.

- a) Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418) in clinical trials, except for adverse reactions identified in post-marketing surveillance marked with * .
- b) Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe haemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients.
- c) ADR explained in the section below.
- d) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (post-operative days 10-14). Haemostasis was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to appropriate levels by post-operative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## ADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process

Of the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell protein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or transient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients reported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst repeated exposures to the study product.

## Hypersensitivity

Allergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paraesthesia, rash, flushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus.

## Paediatric population

Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults. Other than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and catheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Mechanism of action

ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII glycoprotein found in human plasma. Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2 332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass of 280 kD.

The factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von Willebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII binds to endogenous von Willebrand factor in the patient's circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as results of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.

Of note, annualized bleeding rate (ABR) is not comparable between different factor concentrates and between different clinical studies.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

Data on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within a sub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart review was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective registry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed ITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved.

In study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an individualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen (20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ± 6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to a specific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval of 72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are comparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with ADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) in 'Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII' and 'treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)' (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay.

A total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII &lt; 1%) provided pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters that were included in the per-protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 month to &lt; 2 years of age), children (2 to &lt; 5 years of age), older children (5 to &lt; 12 years of age), adolescents (12 to &lt; 18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize PK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion.

a Calculated as (Cmax - baseline factor VIII) divided by the dose in IU/kg, where Cmax is the maximal post-infusion factor VIII measurement.

## Paediatric population

The safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of adult patients. Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 20% lower in young children (less than 6 years of age) than in adults, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients.

Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute toxicology, repeated dose toxicity, local toxicity and genotoxicity.

A local tolerance study in rabbits showed that ADVATE reconstituted with 2 ml of sterilised water for injections is well tolerated after intravenous administration. Slight transient reddening at the administration site was observed after intraarterial application and after paravenous administration. However, no correlating adverse histopathological changes could be observed indicating a transient nature of this finding.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

ADVATE is to be administered intravenously after reconstitution of the product.

The reconstituted medicinal product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The solution should be clear, colourless and free from foreign particles. Do not use solutions that are cloudy or have deposits.

- -For administration the use of a luer-lock syringe is required.
- -Use within three hours after reconstitution.
- -Do not refrigerate the preparation after reconstitution.
- -Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## Reconstitution with the BAXJECT II device

- -For reconstitution use only the sterilised water for injections and the reconstitution device provided in the pack.
- -Do not use if the BAXJECT II device, its sterile barrier system or its packaging is damaged or shows any sign of deterioration.
- -Aseptic technique should be used.
1. If the product is still stored in a refrigerator, take both the ADVATE powder and solvent vials from the refrigerator and let them reach room temperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C).
2. Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water.
3. Remove caps from powder and solvent vials.
4. Cleanse stoppers with alcohol swabs. Place the vials on a flat clean surface.
5. Open the package of BAXJECT II device by peeling away the paper lid without touching the inside (Fig. a). Do not remove the device from the package. Do not use if the BAXJECT II device, its sterile barrier system or its packaging is damaged or shows any sign of deterioration.
6. Turn the package over and insert the clear plastic spike through the solvent stopper. Grip the package at its edge and pull the package off BAXJECT II (Fig. b). Do not remove the blue cap from the BAXJECT II device.
7. For reconstitution only the sterilised water for injections and the reconstitution device provided in the pack should be used. With BAXJECT II attached to the solvent vial, invert the system so that the solvent vial is on top of the device. Insert the white plastic spike through the ADVATE powder stopper. The vacuum will draw the solvent into the ADVATE powder vial (Fig. c).
8. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved. Be sure that the ADVATE powder is completely dissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted solution will pass through the device filter. The product dissolves rapidly (usually in less than 1 minute). After reconstitution the solution should be clear, colourless and free from foreign particles.

## Reconstitution with the BAXJECT III system

Do not use if the lid is not completely sealed on the blister.

1. If the product is still stored in a refrigerator, take the sealed blister (contains powder and solvent vials preassembled with the system for reconstitution) from the refrigerator and let it reach room temperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C).
2. Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water.
3. Open the ADVATE package by peeling away the lid. Remove the BAXJECT III system from the blister.
4. Place the ADVATE on a flat surface with the solvent vial on top (Fig. 1). The solvent vial has a blue stripe. Do not remove the blue cap until instructed in a later step.
5. With one hand holding the ADVATE in the BAXJECT III system, press down firmly on the solvent vial with the other hand until the system is fully collapsed and the solvent flows down into the ADVATE vial (Fig. 2). Do not tilt the system until the transfer is complete.
6. Verify that the solvent transfer is complete. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved (Fig. 3). Be sure that the ADVATE powder is completely dissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted solution will pass through the device filter. The product dissolves rapidly (usually in less than 1 minute). After reconstitution the solution should be clear, colourless and free from foreign particles.

## Administration

Use aseptic technique

Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected for particulate matter prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Only a clear and colourless solution should be used.

1. Remove the blue cap from BAXJECT II / BAXJECT III. Do not draw air into the syringe . Connect the syringe to BAXJECT II / BAXJECT III.
2. Invert the system (the vial with the reconstituted solution has to be on top). Draw the reconstituted solution into the syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly.
3. Disconnect the syringe.
4. Attach a butterfly needle to the syringe. Inject intravenously. The solution should be administered slowly, at a rate as determined by the patient's comfort level, not to exceed 10 ml per minute. The pulse rate should be determined before and during administration of ADVATE. Should a significant increase occur, reducing the rate of administration or temporarily interrupting the injection usually allows the symptoms to disappear promptly (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

octocog alfa (recombinant human coagulation factor VIII)

Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
- -If you get any side effects talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What ADVATE is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you use ADVATE
3. How to use ADVATE
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store ADVATE
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What ADVATE is and what it is used for

ADVATE contains the active substance octocog alfa, human coagulation factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology. Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. In patients with haemophilia A (inborn lack of factor VIII), it is missing or not working properly.

ADVATE is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients of all age groups with haemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII).

ADVATE is prepared without the addition of any human- or animal-derived protein in the entire manufacturing process.

## 2. What you need to know before you use ADVATE

## Do not use ADVATE

- -if you are allergic to octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
- -if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins

If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor before using ADVATE. You should tell your doctor if you have been previously treated with factor VIII products, especially if you developed inhibitors, since there might be a higher

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

risk that it happens again. Inhibitors are blocking antibodies against factor VIII that reduce the efficacy of ADVATE to prevent or control bleeding. Development of inhibitors is a known complication in the treatment of haemophilia A. If your bleeding is not controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor immediately.

There is a rare risk that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic reaction) to ADVATE. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions such as rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, general feeling of being unwell, and dizziness. These symptoms can constitute an early symptom of an anaphylactic shock, manifestations of which may additionally include extreme dizziness, loss of consciousness, and extreme difficulty in breathing.

If any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment.

If you have a catheter (central venous access device) where this medicine can be administered into your bloodstream, you may be at risk of developing catheter-related infections or blood clots.

If you suffer from cardiac disease, please inform your doctor, as there is an increased risk of blood clotting (coagulation) complications.

## Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors

The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with all factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If you or your child's bleeding is not being controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor immediately.

## Children and adolescents

The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children (from 0 to 18 years of age).

## Other medicines and ADVATE

Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine.

## Driving and using machines

ADVATE has no or negligible influence on your ability to drive or to use machines.

## ADVATE contains sodium

This medicine contains 10 mg sodium (main component of cooking salt) per vial. This is equivalent to 0.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.

## ADVATE contains polysorbate 80

This medicine contains 0.5 mg of polysorbate 80 in each vial which is equivalent to 0.1 mg/ml. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have or your child has any known allergies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How to use ADVATE

Treatment with ADVATE will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with haemophilia A.

Your doctor will calculate your dose of ADVATE (in international units or IU) depending on your condition and body weight, and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The frequency of administration will depend on how well ADVATE is working for you. Usually, the replacement therapy with ADVATE is a life-long treatment.

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not sure.

## Prevention of bleeding

The usual dose of octocog alfa is 20 to 40 IU per kg body weight, administered every 2 to 3 days. However, in some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may be necessary.

## Treatment of bleeding

The dose of octocog alfa is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be achieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding.

Dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5

If you have the impression that the effect of ADVATE is insufficient, talk to your doctor. Your doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII levels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery.

## Use in children and adolescents

For the treatment of bleeding the dosing in children does not differ from adult patients. For the prevention of bleeding in children under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended. The administration of ADVATE in children (intravenously) does not differ from the administration in adults. A central venous access device (CVAD) may become necessary to allow frequent infusions of factor VIII products.

## How ADVATE is given

ADVATE is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone else might also administer ADVATE as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. Detailed instructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet.

## If you use more ADVATE than you should

Always take ADVATE exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you are not sure. If you inject more ADVATE than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible.

## If you forget to use ADVATE

Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as scheduled and continue as advised by your doctor.

## If you stop using ADVATE

Do not stop using ADVATE without consulting your doctor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

If severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic) occur, the injection must be stopped immediately . You must contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early symptoms of allergic reactions:

- -swelling of lips and tongue,
- -difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest,
- -general feeling of being unwell,
- -dizziness and loss of consciousness.

Severe symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (nearly) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment.

For children not previously treated with factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies (see section 2) may form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 people); however patients who have received previous treatment with factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in 100 people). If this happens your or your child's medicines may stop working properly and you or your child may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Use only the sterilised water for injections and the reconstitution device for preparation of the solution that are provided with each package of ADVATE. ADVATE must not be mixed with other medicinal products or solvents.

It is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered, the name and batch number of the product are recorded.

## Instructions for reconstitution

-  Do not use after the expiry date stated on the labels and carton.
-  Do not use if the BAXJECT II device, its sterile barrier system or its packaging is damaged or

shows any sign of deterioration as indicated by the symbol:

-  Do not refrigerate the solution after preparation.
1. If the product is still stored in a refrigerator, take both the ADVATE powder and solvent vials from the refrigerator and let them reach room temperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C).
2. Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water.
3. Remove caps from powder and solvent vials.
4. Cleanse stoppers with alcohol swabs. Place the vials on a flat clean surface.
5. Open the package of BAXJECT II device by peeling away the paper lid without touching the inside (Fig. a). Do not remove the device from the package. Do not use if the BAXJECT II device, its sterile barrier system or its packaging is damaged or shows any sign of deterioration.
6. Turn the package over and insert the clear plastic spike through the solvent stopper. Grip the package at its edge and pull the package off BAXJECT II (Fig. b). Do not remove the blue cap from the BAXJECT II device.
7. For reconstitution only the sterilised water for injections and the reconstitution device provided in the pack should be used. With BAXJECT II attached to the solvent vial, invert the system so that the solvent vial is on top of the device. Insert the white plastic spike through the ADVATE powder stopper. The vacuum will draw the solvent into the ADVATE powder vial (Fig. c).
8. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved. Be sure that the ADVATE powder is completely dissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted solution will pass through the device filter. The product dissolves rapidly (usually in less than 1 minute). After reconstitution the solution should be clear, colourless and free from foreign particles.

## Prophylaxis

For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.

In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.

## Paediatric population

For on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult patients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy.

octocog alfa (recombinant human coagulation factor VIII)

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
- -If you get any side effects talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What ADVATE is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you use ADVATE
3. How to use ADVATE
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store ADVATE
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What ADVATE is and what it is used for

ADVATE contains the active substance octocog alfa, human coagulation factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology. Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. In patients with haemophilia A (inborn lack of factor VIII), it is missing or not working properly.

ADVATE is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients of all age groups with haemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII).

ADVATE is prepared without the addition of any human- or animal-derived protein in the entire manufacturing process.

## 2. What you need to know before you use ADVATE

## Do not use ADVATE

- -if you are allergic to octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
- -if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins

If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor before using ADVATE. You should tell your doctor if you have been previously treated with factor VIII products, especially if you developed inhibitors, since there might be a higher

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

risk that it happens again. Inhibitors are blocking antibodies against factor VIII that reduce the efficacy of ADVATE to prevent or control bleeding. Development of inhibitors is a known complication in the treatment of haemophilia A. If your bleeding is not controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor immediately.

There is a rare risk that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic reaction) to ADVATE. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions such as rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, general feeling of being unwell, and dizziness. These symptoms can constitute an early symptom of an anaphylactic shock, manifestations of which may additionally include extreme dizziness, loss of consciousness, and extreme difficulty in breathing.

If any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment.

If you have a catheter (central venous access device) where this medicine can be administered into your bloodstream, you may be at risk of developing catheter-related infections or blood clots.

If you suffer from cardiac disease, please inform your doctor, as there is an increased risk of blood clotting (coagulation) complications.

## Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors

The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with all factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If you or your child's bleeding is not being controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor immediately.

## Children and adolescents

The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children (from 0 to 18 years of age).

## Other medicines and ADVATE

Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine.

## Driving and using machines

ADVATE has no or negligible influence on your ability to drive or to use machines.

## ADVATE contains sodium

This medicine contains 10 mg sodium (main component of cooking salt) per vial. This is equivalent to 0.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.

## ADVATE contains polysorbate 80

This medicine contains 0.5 mg of polysorbate 80 in each vial which is equivalent to 0.1 mg/ml. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have or your child has any known allergies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How to use ADVATE

Treatment with ADVATE will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with haemophilia A.

Your doctor will calculate your dose of ADVATE (in international units or IU) depending on your condition and body weight, and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The frequency of administration will depend on how well ADVATE is working for you. Usually, the replacement therapy with ADVATE is a life-long treatment.

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not sure.

## Prevention of bleeding

The usual dose of octocog alfa is 20 to 40 IU per kg body weight, administered every 2 to 3 days. However, in some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may be necessary.

## Treatment of bleeding

The dose of octocog alfa is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be achieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding.

Dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5

If you have the impression that the effect of ADVATE is insufficient, talk to your doctor. Your doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII levels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery.

## Use in children and adolescents

For the treatment of bleeding the dosing in children does not differ from adult patients. For the prevention of bleeding in children under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended. The administration of ADVATE in children (intravenously) does not differ from the administration in adults. A central venous access device (CVAD) may become necessary to allow frequent infusions of factor VIII products.

## How ADVATE is given

ADVATE is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone else might also administer ADVATE as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. Detailed instructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet.

## If you use more ADVATE than you should

Always take ADVATE exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you are not sure. If you inject more ADVATE than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible.

## If you forget to use ADVATE

Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as scheduled and continue as advised by your doctor.

## If you stop using ADVATE

Do not stop using ADVATE without consulting your doctor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

If severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic) occur, the injection must be stopped immediately . You must contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early symptoms of allergic reactions:

- -rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching,
- -swelling of lips and tongue,
- -difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest,
- -general feeling of being unwell,
- -dizziness and loss of consciousness.

Severe symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (nearly) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment.

For children not previously treated with factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies (see section 2) may form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 people); however patients who have received previous treatment with factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in 100 people). If this happens your or your child's medicines may stop working properly and you or your child may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately.

## Instructions for preparation and administration

ADVATE must not be mixed with other medicinal products or solvents.

It is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered, the name and batch number of the product are recorded.

## Instructions for reconstitution

-  Do not use after the expiry date stated on the labels and carton.
-  Do not use if the lid is not completely sealed on the blister.
-  Do not refrigerate the solution after preparation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. If the product is still stored in a refrigerator, take the sealed blister (contains powder and solvent vials preassembled with the system for reconstitution) from the refrigerator and let it reach room temperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C).
2. Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water.
3. Open the ADVATE package by peeling away the lid. Remove the BAXJECT III system from the blister.
4. Place the ADVATE on a flat surface with the solvent vial on top (Fig. 1). The solvent vial has a blue stripe. Do not remove the blue cap until instructed in a later step.
5. With one hand holding the ADVATE in the BAXJECT III system, press down firmly on the solvent vial with the other hand until the system is fully collapsed and the solvent flows down into the ADVATE vial (Fig. 2). Do not tilt the system until the transfer is complete.
6. Verify that the solvent transfer is complete. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved (Fig. 3). Be sure that the ADVATE powder is completely dissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted solution will pass through the device filter. The product dissolves rapidly (usually in less than 1 minute). After reconstitution the solution should be clear, colourless and free from foreign particles.

## Instructions for injection

Aseptic technique is required during administration. For administration the use of a luer-lock syringe is required.

## Important note:

-  Do not try to administer the injection unless you have received special training from your doctor or nurse.
-  Inspect the prepared solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution should be clear, colourless and free from foreign particles).

Do not use ADVATE if the solution is not fully clear or not completely dissolved.

1. Remove the blue cap from BAXJECT III. Do not draw air into the syringe . Connect the syringe to BAXJECT III.
2. Invert the system (the vial with the reconstituted solution has to be on top). Draw the reconstituted solution into the syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly.
3. Disconnect the syringe.
4. Attach a butterfly needle to the syringe and inject the reconstituted solution into a vein. The solution should be administered slowly, at a rate as determined by the patient's comfort level, not to exceed 10 ml per minute. (See section 4 'Possible side effects').

## On demand treatment

In case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery.

The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual case. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those calculated using the formula may be necessary.

Table 1. Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery

| Degree of haemorrhage/type of surgical procedure                   | Factor VIII level required (% or IU/dl)   | Frequency of doses (hours)/duration of therapy (days)                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Prophylaxis

For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.

In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.

## Paediatric population

For on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult patients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy.

## 1. What ADVATE is and what it is used for

ADVATE contains the active substance octocog alfa, human coagulation factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology. Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. In patients with haemophilia A (inborn lack of factor VIII), it is missing or not working properly.

ADVATE is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients of all age groups with haemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII).

ADVATE is prepared without the addition of any human- or animal-derived protein in the entire manufacturing process.

## 2. What you need to know before you use ADVATE

## Do not use ADVATE

- -if you are allergic to octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
- -if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins

If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor before using ADVATE. You should tell your doctor if you have been previously treated with factor VIII products, especially if you developed inhibitors, since there might be a higher risk that it happens again. Inhibitors are blocking antibodies against factor VIII that reduce the efficacy of ADVATE to prevent or control bleeding. Development of inhibitors is a known complication in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment of haemophilia A. If your bleeding is not controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor immediately.

There is a rare risk that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic reaction) to ADVATE. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions such as rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, general feeling of being unwell, and dizziness. These symptoms can constitute an early symptom of an anaphylactic shock, manifestations of which may additionally include extreme dizziness, loss of consciousness, and extreme difficulty in breathing.

If any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment.

If you have a catheter (central venous access device) where this medicine can be administered into your bloodstream, you may be at risk of developing catheter-related infections or blood clots.

If you suffer from cardiac disease, please inform your doctor, as there is an increased risk of blood clotting (coagulation) complications.

## Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors

The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with all factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If you or your child's bleeding is not being controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor immediately.

## Children and adolescents

The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children (from 0 to 18 years of age).

## Other medicines and ADVATE

Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine.

## Driving and using machines

ADVATE has no or negligible influence on your ability to drive or to use machines.

## ADVATE contains sodium

This medicine contains 10 mg sodium (main component of cooking salt) per vial. This is equivalent to 0.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.

## ADVATE contains polysorbate 80

This medicine contains 0.5 mg of polysorbate 80 in each vial which is equivalent to 0.25  mg/ml. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have or your child has any known allergies.

## Misapplication of ADVATE

Misapplication (injection into the artery or outside the vein) should be avoided as mild, short term injection site reactions, such as bruising and redness, may occur.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How to use ADVATE

Treatment with ADVATE will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with haemophilia A.

Your doctor will calculate your dose of ADVATE (in international units or IU) depending on your condition and body weight, and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The frequency of administration will depend on how well ADVATE is working for you. Usually, the replacement therapy with ADVATE is a life-long treatment.

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not sure.

## Prevention of bleeding

The usual dose of octocog alfa is 20 to 40 IU per kg body weight, administered every 2 to 3 days. However, in some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may be necessary.

## Treatment of bleeding

The dose of octocog alfa is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be achieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding.

Dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5

If you have the impression that the effect of ADVATE is insufficient, talk to your doctor. Your doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII levels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery.

## Use in children and adolescents

For the treatment of bleeding the dosing in children does not differ from adult patients. For the prevention of bleeding in children under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended. The administration of ADVATE in children (intravenously) does not differ from the administration in adults. A central venous access device (CVAD) may become necessary to allow frequent infusions of factor VIII products.

Due to the decrease in injection volume for ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml, the time to react to hypersensitivity reactions during an injection is further reduced. Therefore, caution is advised during injection of ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml, especially in children.

## How ADVATE is given

ADVATE is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone else might also administer ADVATE as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. Detailed instructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet.

## If you use more ADVATE than you should

Always take ADVATE exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you are not sure. If you inject more ADVATE than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you forget to use ADVATE

Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as scheduled and continue as advised by your doctor.

## If you stop using ADVATE

Do not stop using ADVATE without consulting your doctor.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

If severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic) occur, the injection must be stopped immediately . You must contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early symptoms of allergic reactions:

- -rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching,
- -swelling of lips and tongue,
- -difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest,
- -general feeling of being unwell,
- -dizziness and loss of consciousness.

Severe symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (nearly) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment.

For children not previously treated with factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies (see section 2) may form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 people); however patients who have received previous treatment with factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in 100 people). If this happens your or your child's medicines may stop working properly and you or your child may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately.

## Instructions for preparation and administration

Aseptic technique is required during preparation of the solution and administration.

Use only the sterilised water for injections and the reconstitution device for preparation of the solution that are provided with each package of ADVATE. ADVATE must not be mixed with other medicinal products or solvents.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered, the name and batch number of the product are recorded.

## Instructions for reconstitution

-  Do not use after the expiry date stated on the labels and carton.
-  Do not use if the BAXJECT II device, its sterile barrier system or its packaging is damaged or shows any sign of deterioration as indicated by the symbol: .
-  Do not refrigerate the solution after preparation.
1. If the product is still stored in a refrigerator, take both the ADVATE powder and solvent vials from the refrigerator and let them reach room temperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C).
2. Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water.
3. Remove caps from powder and solvent vials.
4. Cleanse stoppers with alcohol swabs. Place the vials on a flat clean surface.
5. Open the package of BAXJECT II device by peeling away the paper lid without touching the inside (Fig. a). Do not remove the device from the package. Do not use if the BAXJECT II device, its sterile barrier system or its packaging is damaged or shows any sign of deterioration.
6. Turn the package over and insert the clear plastic spike through the solvent stopper. Grip the package at its edge and pull the package off BAXJECT II (Fig. b). Do not remove the blue cap from the BAXJECT II device.
7. For reconstitution only the sterilised water for injections and the reconstitution device provided in the pack should be used. With BAXJECT II attached to the solvent vial, invert the system so that the solvent vial is on top of the device. Insert the white plastic spike through the ADVATE powder stopper. The vacuum will draw the solvent into the ADVATE powder vial (Fig. c).
8. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved. Be sure that the ADVATE powder is completely dissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted solution will pass through the device filter. The product dissolves rapidly (usually in less than 1 minute). After reconstitution the solution should be clear, colourless and free from foreign particles.

## Instructions for injection

For administration the use of a luer-lock syringe is required.

## Important note:

-  Do not try to administer the injection unless you have received special training from your doctor or nurse.
-  Inspect the prepared solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution should be clear, colourless and free from foreign particles).
- Do not use ADVATE if the solution is not fully clear or not completely dissolved.
1. Remove the blue cap from BAXJECT II. Do not draw air into the syringe . Connect the syringe to BAXJECT II (Fig. d).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2. Invert the system (the vial with the reconstituted solution has to be on top). Draw the reconstituted solution into the syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly (Fig. e).
3. Disconnect the syringe.
4. Attach a butterfly needle to the syringe and inject the reconstituted solution into a vein. The solution should be administered slowly, at a rate as determined by the patient's comfort level, not to exceed 10 ml per minute. (See section 4 'Possible side effects').
5. Discard any unused solution appropriately.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

## On demand treatment

In case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery.

The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual case. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those calculated using the formula may be necessary.

Table 1. Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery

| Degree of haemorrhage/type of surgical procedure                   | Factor VIII level required (% or IU/dl)   | Frequency of doses (hours)/duration of therapy (days)                                                                                                                                            |

## Prophylaxis

For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.

In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.

## Paediatric population

For on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult patients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy.

## 1. What ADVATE is and what it is used for

ADVATE contains the active substance octocog alfa, human coagulation factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology. Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. In patients with haemophilia A (inborn lack of factor VIII), it is missing or not working properly.

ADVATE is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients of all age groups with haemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII).

ADVATE is prepared without the addition of any human- or animal-derived protein in the entire manufacturing process.

## 2. What you need to know before you use ADVATE

## Do not use ADVATE

- -if you are allergic to octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
- -if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins

If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor before using ADVATE. You should tell your doctor if you have been previously treated with factor VIII products, especially if you developed inhibitors, since there might be a higher risk that it happens again. Inhibitors are blocking antibodies against factor VIII that reduce the efficacy of ADVATE to prevent or control bleeding. Development of inhibitors is a known complication in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment of haemophilia A. If your bleeding is not controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor immediately.

There is a rare risk that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic reaction) to ADVATE. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions such as rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, general feeling of being unwell, and dizziness. These symptoms can constitute an early symptom of an anaphylactic shock, manifestations of which may additionally include extreme dizziness, loss of consciousness, and extreme difficulty in breathing.

If any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment.

If you have a catheter (central venous access device) where this medicine can be administered into your bloodstream, you may be at risk of developing catheter-related infections or blood clots.

If you suffer from cardiac disease, please inform your doctor, as there is an increased risk of blood clotting (coagulation) complications.

## Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors

The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with all factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If you or your child's bleeding is not being controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor immediately.

## Children and adolescents

The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children (from 0 to 18 years of age).

## Other medicines and ADVATE

Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine.

## Driving and using machines

ADVATE has no or negligible influence on your ability to drive or to use machines.

## ADVATE contains sodium

This medicine contains 10 mg sodium (main component of cooking salt) per vial. This is equivalent to 0.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.

## ADVATE contains polysorbate 80

This medicine contains 0.5 mg of polysorbate 80 in each vial which is equivalent to 0.25 mg/ml. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have or your child has any known allergies.

## Misapplication of ADVATE

Misapplication (injection into the artery or outside the vein) should be avoided as mild, short term injection site reactions, such as bruising and redness, may occur.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How to use ADVATE

Treatment with ADVATE will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with haemophilia A.

Your doctor will calculate your dose of ADVATE (in international units or IU) depending on your condition and body weight, and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The frequency of administration will depend on how well ADVATE is working for you. Usually, the replacement therapy with ADVATE is a life-long treatment.

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not sure.

## Prevention of bleeding

The usual dose of octocog alfa is 20 to 40 IU per kg body weight, administered every 2 to 3 days. However, in some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may be necessary.

## Treatment of bleeding

The dose of octocog alfa is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be achieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding.

Dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5

If you have the impression that the effect of ADVATE is insufficient, talk to your doctor. Your doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII levels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery.

## Use in children and adolescents

For the treatment of bleeding the dosing in children does not differ from adult patients. For the prevention of bleeding in children under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended. The administration of ADVATE in children (intravenously) does not differ from the administration in adults. A central venous access device (CVAD) may become necessary to allow frequent infusions of factor VIII products.

Due to the decrease in injection volume for ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml, the time to react to hypersensitivity reactions during an injection is further reduced. Therefore, caution is advised during injection of ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml, especially in children.

## How ADVATE is given

ADVATE is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone else might also administer ADVATE as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. Detailed instructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet.

## If you use more ADVATE than you should

Always take ADVATE exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you are not sure. If you inject more ADVATE than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you forget to use ADVATE

Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as scheduled and continue as advised by your doctor.

## If you stop using ADVATE

Do not stop using ADVATE without consulting your doctor.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

If severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic) occur, the injection must be stopped immediately . You must contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early symptoms of allergic reactions:

- -rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching,
- -swelling of lips and tongue,
- -difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest,
- -general feeling of being unwell,
- -dizziness and loss of consciousness.

Severe symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (nearly) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment.

For children not previously treated with factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies (see section 2) may form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 people); however patients who have received previous treatment with factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in 100 people). If this happens your or your child's medicines may stop working properly and you or your child may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately.

## Instructions for preparation and administration

ADVATE must not be mixed with other medicinal products or solvents.

It is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered, the name and batch number of the product are recorded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Instructions for reconstitution

-  Do not use after the expiry date stated on the labels and carton.
-  Do not use if the lid is not completely sealed on the blister.
-  Do not refrigerate the solution after preparation.
1. If the product is still stored in a refrigerator, take the sealed blister (contains powder and solvent vials preassembled with the system for reconstitution) from the refrigerator and let it reach room temperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C).
2. Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water.
3. Open the ADVATE package by peeling away the lid. Remove the BAXJECT III system from the blister.
4. Place the ADVATE on a flat surface with the solvent vial on top (Fig. 1). The solvent vial has a blue stripe. Do not remove the blue cap until instructed in a later step.
5. With one hand holding the ADVATE in the BAXJECT III system, press down firmly on the solvent vial with the other hand until the system is fully collapsed and the solvent flows down into the ADVATE vial (Fig. 2). Do not tilt the system until the transfer is complete.
6. Verify that the solvent transfer is complete. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved (Fig. 3). Be sure that the ADVATE powder is completely dissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted solution will pass through the device filter. The product dissolves rapidly (usually in less than 1 minute). After reconstitution the solution should be clear, colourless and free from foreign particles.

## Instructions for injection

Aseptic technique is required during administration. For administration the use of a luer-lock syringe is required.

## Important note:

-  Do not try to administer the injection unless you have received special training from your doctor or nurse.
-  Inspect the prepared solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution should be clear, colourless and free from foreign particles).
- Do not use ADVATE if the solution is not fully clear or not completely dissolved.
1. Remove the blue cap from BAXJECT III. Do not draw air into the syringe . Connect the syringe to BAXJECT III.
2. Invert the system (the vial with the reconstituted solution has to be on top). Draw the reconstituted solution into the syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly.
3. Disconnect the syringe.
4. Attach a butterfly needle to the syringe and inject the reconstituted solution into a vein. The solution should be administered slowly, at a rate as determined by the patient's comfort level, not to exceed 10 ml per minute. (See section 4 'Possible side effects').
5. Discard any unused solution appropriately.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

## On demand treatment

In case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery.

The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual case. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those calculated using the formula may be necessary.

Table 1. Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery

| Degree of haemorrhage/type of surgical procedure                   | Factor VIII level required (% or IU/dl)   | Frequency of doses (hours)/duration of therapy (days)                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Haemorrhage Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or oral bleeding. | 20 - 40                                   | Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours (8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6) for at least 1 day, until the bleeding episode, as indicated by pain, is resolved or healing is achieved.                                |
| More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or haematoma.        | 30 - 60                                   | Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours (8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6) for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved.                                                                     |
| Life-threatening haemorrhages.                                     | 60 - 100                                  | Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours (6 to 12 hours for patients under the age of 6) until threat is resolved.                                                                                                                 |
| Surgery Minor Including tooth extraction.                          | 30 - 60                                   | Every 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6), at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.                                                                                                                     |
| Major                                                              | 80 - 100 (pre- and post-operative)        | Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours (6 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6) until adequate wound healing, then continue therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl). |

## Prophylaxis

For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.

In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.

## Paediatric population

For on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult patients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy.
