Medicinal product no longer authorised ASSESSMENT REPORT FOR FOCETRIA Common name: pandemic influenza vaccine (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) a/california/7/2009 (H1N1)v like strain (X-181A) Procedure No.  EMEA/H/C/000710/II/0009 Assessment Report as adopted by the CHMP with all information of a commercially confidential nature deleted.

## Introduction

Focetria  is  a  pandemic  H1N1v  vaccine.  The  strain  change  of  the  mock-up  vaccine  from  H5N1  to H1N1v was approved on 29/09/09 (EMEA/H/C/710/PU/05).

Assessment of data on the effect of a booster dose and on persistence of protection was conducted as part of a commirment to submit results of study V87P1. The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) now applies for an update of the product information to include reference to persistence of antibodies data from the initial H5N1 mock-up file 1 .

Medicinal product no longer authorised Study V87P1 2 was a phase 2, randomised, controlled, observer-blind, multicentre study designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two doses (day 0 and day 21), administered three weeks apart, and a six months booster dose (subset) of two MF59 adjuvanted influenza vaccine containing 7.5 µg or 15 µg of H5N1 influenza antigen, in adults, including the elderly.

1 Due  to  the  different  names  given  to  the  products  during  clinical  development,  in  the  present  report  the following  names  refer  to  the  same  formulation  (antigen  quantity  and  adjuvant  amount):  Fluad-H5N1,  H5N1 mock-up vaccine and Focetria (H5N1).

## Results

A total of 486 subjects were enrolled, 313 aged 18-60 years (adults) and 173 aged 61 years and over (elderly).  A  subset  of  subjects  received  a  six  month  booster  dose.  The  primary  immunogenicity objective  was  to  assess  immunogenicity  of  H5N1  influenza  antigen  as  measured  by  HI  assay  after primary vaccinations with H5N1 mock-up influenza vaccine.

The  results  presented  in  this  section  were  analysed  in  the  per-protocol  (PP)  population,  and  are discussed for the 7.5 µ g dose for the elderly only, as per the scope of this variation application.

Approximately  3  weeks  after  primary  vaccination,  GMTs  against  the  A/Vietnam/1194/2004-like (H5N1) influenza antigen in the elderly for the 7.5 µ g group were 66. There was a decrease in titers at day 202 (GMTs: 23), where GMRs over day 43 was 0.33.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Single radial haemolysis (SRH) assay persistence results Twenty four percent of the elderly subjects in the 7.5 µ g group were seroprotected before the booster (day 202). Approximately 3 weeks after the booster, the SRH GMA against the A/Vietnam/1194/2004-like  (H5N1)  influenza  antigen  in  these  elderly  subjects  was  33.  Six  months after the booster (day 382), decreases in GMA were observed, with GMR over day 223 of 0.38. The antibody persistence by SRH assay is shown below (PP population).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Microneutralization (MN) assay persistence results

Forty four percent of elderly subjects in the H5N1 mock-up vaccine 7.5 µ g group had an MN titer ≥ 40 before the booster.  Approximately  3  weeks  after  the  booster  (day  223),  GMTs  against  the A/Vietnam/1194/2004-like (H5N1) influenza antigen in these elderly subjects was 154. Six months after the booster (day 382), decreases in GMTs were observed, with GMRs over day 223 of 0.17.

The antibody persistence by MN assay is shown below (PP population).

Medicinal product no longer authorised Changes to the Product Information The proposed changes to section 5.1 of the SPC (summary of product characteristics) to reflect that limited  data  on  persistence  of  antibodies  in  elderly  immunised  with  the  H5N1  mock-up  vaccine showed that up to 50% of the subjects were seroprotected at  six  months,  were  agreed  with  by  the CHMP. Overall discussion and benefit risk assessment Study  V78P1  was  aimed  to  compare  the  two  initial  formulations  of  vaccines  including  different amount of H5N1 antigen (7.5 vs 15 µg). As the authorised formulation was 7.5 µg the results were discussed regarding this study group.

The overall study had been already submitted as a commitment and this variation procedure focused on the evaluation of the persistence of circulating antibodies and on the effect of the booster dose six months apart from the second dose.

At day 202, 50% of elderly subjects were seroprotected with HI titres &gt;= 40. The MN results showed a seroprotection of 44% in elderly subjects, which was consistent with the HI data.

Overall  the  results  of  the  study  presented  support  the  inclusion  of  the  statement  regarding antibody persistence in the elderly population in the product information of the Focetria A/H1N1 pandemic vaccine.
