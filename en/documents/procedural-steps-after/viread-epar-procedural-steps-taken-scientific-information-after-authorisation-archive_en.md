This is a randomized, double-blind evaluation of the antiviral efficacy, safety and tolerability of Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. This application fulfils the Article 46 requirement to provide the final (Week 192) study results. The risk minimisation measures for the paediatric population are being removed from the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and Annex II of the PI. The RMP version 26 has been submitted. The MAH also took the opportunity to implement minor linguistic amendments throughout the PI.

Furthermore, it is anticipated that the use of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) as part of antiretroviral regimens in children and adolescent will ultimately be replaced by tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)- containing regimens for which a lesser impact on bone and renal function is expected. Furthermore, the results of this DUS suggest that there were minimal renal or bone safety adverse events across all evaluated laboratory measures observed with the Viread/TDF-Fixed Dose Combinations treatment groups and patients generally recovered within a few weeks of the adverse event; reflecting that population of HIV infected children and adolescents is kept under close scrutiny by   |

No clinically significant drug interactions were observed between emtricitabine or dolutegravir and Harvoni. Accordingly, Truvada and Viread can be coadministered with Harvoni without dose adjustment but with close monitoring of renal function as the increased exposure of tenofovir could potentiate adverse reactions associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, including renal disorders. Renal function should be closely monitored.   |

| II/0173 | Submission of final long-term safety and efficacy data (480 weeks) from two completed Phase 3 studies in chronic hepatitis B e antigen negative (HBeAg-) patients (study GS -US-174-0102) and e antigen positive (HBeAg+) patients (Study GS-US- 174-0103). GS-US-174-0102 - a randomized, double-blind, controlled evaluation of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate versus adefovir dipivoxil for the treatment of presumed pre-core mutant chronic hepatitis B. GS-US-174-0103 - a randomized, double-blind, controlled evaluation of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate versus adefovir dipivoxil for the treatment of HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | 30/03/2017 | n/a | The two studies consisted of 48 weeks of double blind therapy with Viread 300 mg or Hepsera 10 mg once daily, followed by open label treatment with Viread until week 480. Data through week 384 (Year 8) have been previously submitted and assessed (EMEA/H/C/000419/II/0143). Those long-term data confirmed the potency and high genetic barrier of the drug even though mitigated by a limited hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs) seroconversion rate and have been reflected in the SmPC. The current report remains limited as only a third of the patients remains in the study after Year 8. Virologic suppression was maintained in patients with available data through Week 480 and no mutations associated with resistance to tenofovir were detected in patients who received tenofovir/disoproxil fumarate for up to 480 weeks. The 480 week safety data in both pivotal studies GS-US- 174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103 were consistent with the known safety profile of the drug, with renal and bone adverse events still representing the most commonly drug- related adverse reactions in TDF-treated patients. The CHMP concluded that these results do not warrant an update of the SmPC. |

There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these have predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine. The main adverse reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia). These events have often been transitory. Late onset neurological disorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether such neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.

The provision of the CSR fulfils the RMP commitment (category 1-3 pharmacovigilance activity) to provide the final report by Q3 2015. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 03/03/2016 | 16/02/2017 | SmPC | After 240 weeks of treatment, 117 of 141 subjects (83%) randomised to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate had HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, and 51 of 79 subjects (65%) had ALT normalisation. After 240 weeks of treatment with emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, 115 of 139 subjects (83%) had HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, and 59 of 83 subjects (71%) had ALT normalisation. Among the HBeAg positive subjects randomised to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, 16 of 65 subjects (25%) experienced HBeAg loss, and 8 of 65 subjects (12%) experienced anti HBe seroconversion through week 240. In the HBeAg positive subjects randomised to emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, 13 of 68 subjects (19%) experienced HBeAg loss, and 7 of 68 subjects (10%) experienced anti HBe seroconversion through week 240. Two subjects randomised to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate experienced HBsAg loss by Week 240, but not seroconversion to anti HBs. Five subjects randomised to emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate experienced HBsAg loss, with 2 of these 5 subjects experiencing seroconversion to anti- HBs. In study GS US 174 0121, 141 patients with lamivudine resistance substitutions at baseline received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for up to 240 weeks.

| WS/0564 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Submission of the final phase 3 clinical study report (Study GS-99-903) as a worksharing procedure to fulfil a Viread, Truvada and Eviplera Post- Authorisation Measure (PAM). This study was extended to evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in particular to collect long-term exposure information on BMD and bone events. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | 25/09/2014 | n/a        |                       | The results from this extension phase tend to show that the median decrease in bone mineral density observed through the first 24-48 weeks of treatment seems to remain relatively stable over 13 years of treatment. As regards bone fractures, 8 events were reported during the study. All of them were trauma-related, not considered related to tenofovir or Truvada and were recovered. As regards the renal function, the median change in eGFRCG seems not clinically relevant (with no subjects experiencing eGFRCG below 50 mL/min) and glomerular function remained stable through study. No Fanconi syndrome or tubulopathy was reported. The only renal SAE reported was kidney pain which was not related to study drug. No new safety concern was raised from these final study results.

|         | WSA for Atripla, Truvada, Stribild, Viread and Eviplera to update sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC for all tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-containing products to revise the renal monitoring recommendations and to implement additional renal safety information. The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly and the key messages for the annex II for Viread and Atripla were updated to reflect this information as appropriate. The MAH submitted this variation in fulfilment of a post-autorisation measure for Viread on the reversibility of TDF associated renal tubulopathy. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   |            |            |                        | renal safety information in the SmPC of all the TDF- containing products. The main messages on renal safety are the following: to differentiate the monitoring depending on the presence of renal risk factors (reinforced monitoring) or not (standard monitoring); to consider interruption of treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in case of progressive decline of renal function when no other cause has been identified; to reflect the impact of the NSAIDs and boosted PIs in renal function and to inform prescribers that in some patients, renal function did not completely resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil fumarate discontinuation.   |

| WS/0530 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 4.4 'Special warnings and precautions for use' of the SmPC for Atripla, Emtriva, Eviplera, Stribild, Truvada, Viread and Vitekta to revise the wording regarding the risk of sexual transmission of HIV infection following CHMP request adopted in December 2013. The PL has been updated accordingly. Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity of this worksharing to update the PL with the details of the local representatives for Croatia and to introduce the Croatian language annexes for Emtriva and to update the bottle label to include the EDQM short standard term for the pharmaceutical form for Stribild. C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation | 20/03/2014 | 19/03/2015 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | During recent years conclusive evidence has been collected which shows that the risk for HIV patients, who are well treated, to sexually transmit HIV to their partner is exceedingly low. A position statement on the use of antiretroviral therapy to reduce HIV transmission was published by the British HIV Association (BHIVA) in January 2013. As a consequence, the recommendations for post- exposure prophylaxis have also been changed in recently updated HIV treatment guidelines. For example, the 2013 BHIVA guideline does not generally recommend post- exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after exposure from a patient with well treated HIV. Based on these data, the wording on the risk of transmission for HIV products was revised to reflect the current scientific knowledge. While effective suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.

| II/0123/G | This was an application for a group of variations. Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC for Viread 33 mg/g granules to allow daily dose adjustment using the granules formulation in adults with moderate and severe renal impairment, as an alternative to dose-interval adjustment using the Viread 245 mg film-coated tablets. The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. This group submission includes a Type IB variation to update section 4.2 of the SmPC for 245 mg film coated tablets to reflect daily dose adjustment using the granules formulation in adults with moderate and severe renal impairment. The annex II was updated accordingly. Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity of this variation to make a minor correction to section 5.2 of the SmPC. C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and | 19/09/2013   | 18/10/2013 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | Dosing recommendations for TDF in adult patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, or patients with end- stage renal disease who are receiving haemodialysis, were implemented by prolonging the dosing interval of TDF 300- mg tablets. The availability of the TDF granules formulation allows for dose adjustment. As a consequence of the availability of this new formulation, the CHMP requested to provide additional PK simulations to evaluate the adequacy of daily dose adjustment in adult patients with moderate and severe renal impairment. Daily dosing of a lower dose could provide a narrower range of TFV exposures than those with dose interval adjustment. Pharmacokinetic modelling of single dose pharmacokinetic data in non HIV and non HBV infected adult subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment was used to determine dose adjustment recommendations for adult subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment. Based on these submitted data, recommendations for daily dose adjustments were introduced for patients with moderate and severe renal impairment as well as for patients with |

| II/0121 | Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC for 245 mg film-coated tablet formulation, in order to add longer term safety and efficacy data (week 288) from Study GS-US-174-0102 and Study GS-US-174- 0103 in patients with compensated chronic hepatitis B. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 19/09/2013 | 18/10/2013 | SmPC | In April 2008, EU marketing authorisation was first granted for Viread indicated in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in adults. Marketing authorisation of Viread for CHB was based primarily on data from 266 adult subjects with hepatitis B early antigen positive (HBeAg+) compensated CHB and 375 subjects with hepatitis B early antigen negative (HBeAg-) compensated CHB who enrolled in the similarly designed pivotal studies GS-US-174-0102 (HBeAg- subjects) and GS -US-174-0103 (HBeAg+ subjects). For both trials 0102 and 0103, week 288 longer term (open label) continuation data has become available. These data are now reflected in the Product Information. It is remarked that viral suppression, biochemical and serological responses were maintained with continued tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treatment. Also, the adverse reactions observed with continued treatment for 288 weeks were consistent with the known safety profile of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Nevertheless, a worrying trend has been detected towards a small but increasing proportion of TDF-treated patients experiencing mild to moderate decrease in creatinine clearance (Clcr) over the last two years of continuous treatment. The impact of the latter is under further assessment. It is concluded that the benefit-risk balance in the use of Viread in patients with compensated chronic hepatitis B remains unchanged. |

Licensing of Viread for CHB was based primarily on data from 266 adult subjects with hepatitis B early antigen positive (HBeAg+) compensated CHB and 375 subjects with hepatitis B early antigen negative (HBeAg-) compensated CHB who enrolled in the similarly designed pivotal studies GS-US-174- 0102 (HBeAg- subjects) and GS-US-174-0103 (HBeAg+ subjects). The application for the CHB indication also included supportive safety data, blinded with regard to treatment assignment, from Study GS-US-174-0108, which is a double-blind, active-controlled study of tenofovir DF in subjects with CHB and decompensated liver disease. A total of 112 subjects have been treated in this study, and the planned primary analyses of safety and efficacy, based on the first 48 weeks of treatment with tenofovir DF, the fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine/tenofovir DF, or entecavir, were previously presented and assessed. On the basis of these study results, the MAH received an extension of the indication for Viread to include the treatment of patients with decompensated chronic hepatitis B. Since the original submission of the 48-weeks data, the week 168 final clinical study report for Study GS-US-174-0108 has become available. These data are now reflected in the Product Information. It is remarked that the study was not adequately powered to clearly demonstrate meaningful differences in efficacy parameters between groups. The benefit-risk balance in the use of Viread in patients with decompensated CHB remains unchanged.   |

Therefore, the CHMP had requested the inclusion of information on immune disorders under immune reconstitution as a class labelling for all antiretrovirals for the treatment of HIV.   |

| II/0120   | Extension of the indication: Treatment of adults with lamivudine resistant chronic hepatitis B. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC were updated. Updates to Annex I and IIIa are proposed to reflect the fact that the EDQM short standard term 'tablet(s)' was introduced into the Viread packaging Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 8. Also, the MAH took the opportunity of this variation to perform minor linguistic amendments for the CZ and DE annexes. A factual error in the Estonian SmPC is corrected.

However, this good virological response only translates into a slight increase in patients achieving HBeAg loss and seroconversion (around 38% and 30% had HBeg loss/seroconversion at week 240 respectively). Cumulatively, 8% of patients (all HBeAg+ patients) achieved HBsAg loss at week 240. No mutations associated with resistance to tenofovir were detected in patients who received tenofovir for up to 240 weeks. The adverse reactions observed with continued treatment for 240 weeks were consistent with the safety profile of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.   |

The MAH took this opportunity to harmonize the PI across the products Viread, Emtriva, Truvada and Atripla. Following CHMP request, section 4.6 \"fertility, pregnancy and lactation\" of the SmPC was updated according to the Guideline on Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products on Human Reproduction and Lactation: From Data to Labelling (EMEA/CHMP/203927/2005). In addition a number of minor linguistic amendments were implemented. Furthermore the contact details of the local representatives in the PL were updated. | 23/06/2011 | 05/08/2011 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | The MAH took this opportunity to harmonize the PI across the products Viread (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), Emtriva (emtricitabine), Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and Atripla (efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). Following CHMP request section 4.6 of the SmPC on fertility, pregnancy and lactation was revised. A moderate amount of data mainly from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry on pregnant women (between 300-1000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformations or foetal / neonatal toxicity associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate nor with emtricitabine. |

An estimated frequency of Stevens-Johnson syndrome could not be determined for this adverse event since the identified reports include only spontaneous cases and true exposure data from these sources are limited. After a search of the MAH's database, the MAH further identified \"Hypoglycaemia\" and \"Pneumonia\" as additional adverse events to be included in section 4.8. Based on an evaluation of the incidences in the pivotal phase III studies the estimated frequencies of pneumonia (1.4%) and hypoglycaemia (1.2%) have been determined to fall within the CIOMS frequency category of Common |

| II/0096 | Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC based on the long term results (144 weeks) from studies GS- US-174-0103 and GS-US-174-0102 in hepatitis B infected patients. In addition MAH took this opportunity to introduce minor linguistic amendments in some of the language versions. The PL was updated in accordance. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 18/02/2010 | 09/04/2010 | SmPC and PL | The long term safety data of the two pivotal clinical studies in HBeAg+ and HBeAg- patients underline both the efficacy and safety of tenofovir in its indication in the treatment of Hepatitis B. In both studies, viral suppression was maintained through week 144, reaching 87% in HBeAg- and 71% in HBeAg+ patients. Nevertheless, this good virological response only translated into a slight increase in patients achieving HBeAg loss and seroconversion (around 25 and 30% had HBeAg loss/seroconversion at week 144 respectively). Cumulatively, 8% of patients (all HBeAg+ patients) achieved HBsAg loss at week 144. No mutations associated with resistance to tenofovir were detected.

| II/0089   | Update of section 5.1 or the SPC to reflect the 48 weeks data from study GS-US-174-0106, in hepatitis B infected patients receiving adefovir dipivoxil with persistent viral replication.

The 48 week results presented do not allow a direct comparison between the both treatment groups beyond week 24 since the study design allowed patients with partial response to treatment to switch to open label emtricitabine /tenofovir DF. Therefore, the SPC is updated with the results at week 24 which further confirm that tenofovir DF is a potent drug in treatment experienced patients with active replication under adefovir dipivoxil therapy. Furthermore, resistance analysis at 1 year suggests that tenofovir DF has a high genetic barrier in treatment-experienced patients. The safety profile of tenofovir DF in this study was consistent with the safety profile described in pivotal studies in naïve patients. |

These studies were similar in design, with first 48 weeks of double-blind therapy with tenofovir DF once daily or with adefovir dipivoxil once daily, followed by open-label treatment with tenofovir DF through week 384.

|         | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet                                     |            |     |    | phase of these studies supported the extension of the indication of Viread for the treatment of HBV. The 96 weeks data (48 weeks open label) now submitted, show the maintenance of viral suppression, biochemical and serological responses with continued tenofovir DF treatment through week 96 in both HBe Ag positive and negative patients. No mutations associated with viral failure have been detected for tenofovir DF. No new safety finding has been observed in this first year of open label phase particularly in regard to renal toxicity. These results are reflected in section 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC. Furthermore the PL has been subject to a readability focused testing with the major change being the re- ordering of the information in subsection \"Taking other medicines\" to give greater priority to the information on the anti-HIV medicines.   |

In addition, minor linguistic amendments are made to the German language version of the annexes, as relevant. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 24/07/2008   | 12/09/2008 | SmPC and PL | A cumulative review identified 8 cases in which tenofovir DF-related proximal renal tubulopathy may have led to osteomalacia and fractures. Section 4.4 of the SPC and section 2 of the PL were therefore updated to indicate that bone abnormalities associated with proximal renal tubulopathy may infrequently contribute to fractures. Section 4.8 of the SPC and section 4 of the PL were updated to include hypokalaemia (as the review of this adverse event identified 19 key cases of Grade 3 or 4 hypokalaemia where there was evidence of an association with tenofovir DF therapy; all 19 cases involved intercurrent proximal renal tubulopathy). Section 4.8 of the SPC and section 4 of the PL were updated to include hypokalaemia (as the review of this adverse event identified 19 cases of Grade 3 or 4 with evidence of an association with tenofovir DF therapy). In addition, section 4.8 of the SPC and section 4 of the PL were updated to include hepatic steatosis (given that cases of hepatic steatosis have been observed in association with tenofovir DF therapy), rhabdomyolysis, and muscular weakness (as nine reports of unlisted muscle disorders occurring in the context of proximal tubulopathy were identified) and wording to indicate that osteomalacia may be manifested as bone pain and infrequently contribute to fractures. Explanatory text was added in section 4.8 to indicate that |

Therefore post-treatment hepatic flares are a possible consequence of discontinuation of tenofovir DF therapy. This information as been included in section 4,4 of the SPC and reflected in section 4.2. The warnings on the co-administration of tenofovir DF and didanosine have been amended to reflect the suppression of CD4 cell counts observed in patients who were taken both agents at the same time. Furthermore the whole paragraph of this warning has been reworded and reorganised in section 4.4. The PL was amended accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| II/0067 | Update of sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SPC with renal safety information including updated dosing guidelines based on an analysis of relevant tenofovir disoproxil fumarate clinical studies. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 22/03/2007 | 02/05/2007 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Tenofovir exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment and a dosing interval adjustment is recommended for these patients. However, concerning patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min), limited available data from three clinical studies have not indicated that the safety and efficacy profile of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is different to the profile in patients with normal renal function. These limited data support the existing advice that no dosing adjustment to the normal once daily dosing is required in patients with mild renal impairment. Dosing interval adjustment is however required in all patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min). This information was reflected in section 4.2 of the SPC. Section 4.4 of the SPC was also updated with renal safety information concerning possible renal adverse events and the need to assess the potential benefit of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment against the potential risk of renal toxicity. |

Section 4.5 of the SPC reflects this information. This section is further updated in regard to the interactions of tenofovir with lopinavir/ritonavir and with atazanavir/ritonavir in particular to stress the fact that higher concentrations of tenofovir could increase the potential for adverse reactions, including renal disorders.

| II/0065 | Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC and section 2 of the PL to implement the class labelling text on osteonecrosis, agreed by the CHMP in September 2006. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 14/12/2006 | 15/01/2007 | SmPC and PL                      | Cases of osteonecrosis (death of the bone tissue resulting from an insufficient blood supply) have been reported in HIV-infected patients since the end of the 80's. Although the cause of this disease could be due to multi factors (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index) it has occurred specially in patients with HIV advanced disease and/or in patients with long term use of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Further to the review of all available data the CHMP agreed that this information should now be included in the SPC and PL of all antiretroviral medicinal products. Patients should be warned to seek medical advice in case they experience joint stiffness, aches and pain especially of the hip, knee and shoulder or if they experienced any difficulty in movement. |

The benefit/risk profile of Viread in the treatment of the HIV-1 infected adults patients continues to be favourable. However, considering the safety profile of tenofovir (e.g. renal toxicity, bone events, particularly those related to renal events hepatic events) and the evolving therapeutic management of HIV infected patients there is the need for optimisation of therapies and to review its benefit/risk profile. Therefore, it was agreed that Viread should be further review within 5-years time. Moreover, the period safety update reports will be submitted yearly.                                                                                                                                                    |

| II/0059   | Update of section 4.8 of the SPC and section 4 of the PL to include \"myopathy, osteomalacia (both in association with proximal renal tubulopathy)\" and \"acute interstitial nephririts\" in light of the cumulative review of renal events for tenofovir. Section 4.4 of the SPC and section 2 of the PL are updated to include the warning on the concomitant use of Viread with other medicinal products containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada). In addition, the list of local representatives in some EU Member States were updated in section 6 of the PL and minor linguistic changes were introduce in some EU languages versions, as relevant. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   | 27/07/2006   | 01/09/2006   | SmPC and PL   | A review of the bone events in renal cases showed that 8 of the 12 cases with evidence for a positive tenofovir dechallenge included osteomalacia. In non-clinical studies tenofovir was already associated with osteomalacia in monkeys. Osteomalacia was recognised as an adverse reaction to tenofovir treatment but for which the frequency is currently not known. The muscle events in cases of possible fanconi syndrome were also reviewed: in 8 of the 15 cases describing muscle events, a positive dechallenge with clear improvement of the muscle symptoms was described. Myopathy is therefore an adverse reaction to tenofovir treatment for which the frequency is currently not known. A cumulative review of renal disorders lead to the inclusion of acute interstitial nephritis as an adverse reaction to tenofovir treatment but for which a frequency could not be yet determined. Section 4.8 of the SPC and section 4 of the PL were amended in accordance. The fact that Viread should not be taken with any other medicinal product containing tenofovir, particularly Truvada has been included in section 4.4 of the SPC and in section 2 of the PL.   |

Minor linguistic changes were introduced in the SPC and Package Leaflet of some EU languages versions, as relevant. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   | 26/01/2006   | 28/02/2006   | SmPC and PL                      | Two pharmacokinetic studies performed in healthy volunteers investigating potential interactions between tenofovir DF and saquinavir (unboosted and ritonavir boosted) and nelfinavir, respectively showed no clinically relevant interactions. However, while for the concomitant use of tenofovir DF and nelfinavir no effect was observed for saquinavir (boosted regimen) an increased exposure was observed when tenofovir DF is co-administrated. This increase is considered no to be clinically relevant and the SPC has been amended in section 4.5 to reflect these results.   |

| II/0044 | Update of section 4.7 \"Effects on ability to drive and use machines\" and 4.8 \"Undesirable effects\" of the Summary of Product Characteristics and the relevant sections of the Package Leaflet in accordance with the safety-related changes to the Company Core Safety Information, reviewed in the 4th and 5th PSUR covering the period of 01.05.03 to 30.04.04 for Viread 245 mg film-coated tablets. In addition, the MAH applied for the update of section 4.4 \"Special warning and special precautions for use\" regarding the co-administration of tenofovir with didanosine, as proposed by the CHMP following the assessment of the 5th PSUR and further responses of the 4th PSUR. In addition, the MAH took this opportunity to update section 6.1 \"List of excipients\" of the Summary of Product Characteristics and relevant section of the Package Leaflet to add the correspondent \"E\" number. Moreover, Annex II is amended to be in accordance with the latest QRD template. Moreover, the French and Greek Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet are amended to correct some spelling mistakes. | 20/01/2005 | 07/03/2005 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | As mentioned in the 4th (covering the period 01.05.03 - 31.10.03) and 5th (covering the period 01.11.03 - 30.04.04) PSURs, the Company Core Safety Information (CCSI) was updated based on a review of the safety data to reactions and to highlight the fact that the ability of patients to drive and operate machines may be affected as very commonly Viread causes dizziness. Section 4.8 has been updated to include the acute tubular necrosis, increased transaminases and hepatitis as adverse reactions to Viread and section 4.7 as regards dizziness. The PL was amended accordingly. Further to assessment of the 5th PSUR the CHMP concluded that the main safety concerns were the reactions reported with the association tenofovir-didanosine (pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, including rare fatal cases). Section 4.4 and 4.5 were updated not to recommend the co-administration of tenofovir and didanosine and to specify the careful monitoring for efficacy and didanosine related adverse reactions if the combination is judged strictly necessary. The CHMP requested the MAH to propose a harmonised DDL to alert clinicians to maintain a high level of awareness for didanosine-related complications in patients treated with tenofovir+didanosine regardless the dose of didanosine and multitherapies used, the DDL was adopted during the February 2005 CHMP meeting. |

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 18/11/2004 | 10/01/2005 | SmPC and PL | In patients treated with any type of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections may occur, when the immune system responds to treatment. In most cases the inflammatory reaction towards the opportunistic pathogens is not foreseen since the opportunistic infection has not been detected/ diagnosed. If diagnosed prior to the institution of CART, the treatment against the opportunistic infection (OI) is usually given priority. In particular, this is true for the complications most feared in this context; CMV-retinitis, generalised mycobacterial infections and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. An additional reason for treating the OI and the HIV-infection sequentially is the great risk of adverse events (toxicity or lack of effect) due to drug interactions. The clinical consequence of the reactivation of the immune system in patients starting CART cannot be prevented and the early recognition and diagnose of these inflammatory reaction is considering to be important for the clinical handling of the patients. Therefore, further to the assessment of the MAH's responses and discussions held at the Pharmacovigilance working party and CHMP, the CHMP adopted a class labelling text regarding the reactivation of the immune system of HIV-infected patients treated with |

| II/0039 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 21/10/2004 | 06/12/2004 | SmPC and PL | This was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study comparing tenofovir DF administered in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz versus stavudine, lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral-naïve HIV 1 infected patients. This study is the follow-up of the 48 week pivotal double blind GS-99-903 study supportive of the treatment with tenofovir DF in antiretroviral naïve patients. The 144-week efficacy data showed a sustained virological response in both treatment arms and especially the emergence of the critical K65R associated mutation to tenofovir DF phenotypic resistance remain limited (<3%). The long-term safety profile of tenofovir DF was comparable to the safety profile observed through the first 48 weeks of treatment. No new safety signals were identified in the tenofovir DF group. The frequent monitoring of the renal function was however considered still necessary, particularly during the first year of treatment (i.e. every 4 weeks). No clinically significant bone abnormalities were associated with prolonged use of tenofovir. However, tenofovir induces significant decreases in bone mineral density, mainly during the first year of treatment, without aggravation over the time. The effects on bone biomarkers were statistically significantly higher with TDF than with stavudine. The long term safety profile regarding lipodystrophy was favourable to the tenofovir regimen compared with the stavudine regimen, respectively 3% vs 19%.

| II/0041 | Update of the section 4.4 (Special warnings and special precautions for use) of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) of Viread 245 mg film- coated tablets, to implement the class warning text regarding the high rate of virological failure and emergence of resistance at an early stage with triple combinations involving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Tenofovir DF) and two Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTI's), as adopted by the CHMP in July 2004. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics | 16/09/2004 | 28/10/2004 | SmPC     | A high rate of virological failure and emergence of resistance has been observed at an early stage of treatment with triple combinations involving tenofovir and 2NRTIs (tenofovir, lamivudine and abacavir, study ESS30009 and tenofovir, lamivudine, didanosine, Jemsek study) used as a once daily regimen in antiretroviral naïve patients. Two EMEA public statements have been issued (July and October 2003) relating to this topic. Further discussions on these findings have been held at the CHMP as well as at the EMEA HIV Ad Hoc Group. Based on the in vivo and in vitro data submitted by the MAHs a class labelling warning has been adopted by the CHMP in July 2004 to be implemented in section 4.4 of the SPC harmonising the information at |

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and | 24/03/2004   | 10/06/2004 | SmPC and PL | The issue of mitochondrial toxicity in children of in utero and/ or post-natal exposure to NRTIs was first raised in 1999 following the identification of 8 cases of mitochondrial dysfunction in uninfected children included in a clinical trial. The MAHs for all NRTIs were asked to provide preclinical data on the mitochondrial toxicity and a review of adverse reactions potentially attributable to mitochondrial toxicity in children exposed in utero and / or post-natally to NRTIs. Following the assessment of data submitted and discussions held at the PhVWP and CPMP, a class wording was agreed at the November 2003 CPMP meeting, to be implemented in the product information of all NRTIs. |
