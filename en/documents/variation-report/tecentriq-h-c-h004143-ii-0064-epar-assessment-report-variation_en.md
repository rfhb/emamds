## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008,  Roche Registration GmbH submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 28 June 2021 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

## C.I.6 (Extension of indication)

Extension of indication to include adjuvant treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients whose tumours have PD-L1 expression on ≥ 1% of tumour cells (TC) for Tecentriq as monotherapy based on the results from the pivotal phase III Study GO29527 (IMpower010); as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of both the Tecentriq 840mg concentrate for solution for infusion SmPC and the Tecentriq 1,200mg concentrate for solution for infusion SmPC are updated.  Minor editorial changes have been made throughout the SmPC. The Package Leaflets are updated in accordance. Version 21.0 of the RMP has also been submitted.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included (an) EMA Decision(s) P/0207/2019 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0207/2019 was completed.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

The MAH received the following Scientific Advice on the clinical development relevant for the indication subject to the present application: EMEA/H/SA/2522/5/2015/II.

## 1.2. Steps taken for the assessment of the product

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## 2.1.1. Problem statement

## Disease or condition

The claimed the therapeutic indication is:

Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated as adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumours have PD-L1 expression on ≥ 1% of tumour cells (TC).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Epidemiology

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Globally lung cancer is responsible for nearly one in five cancer deaths.

Approximately 2.2 million new cases of lung cancer (accounting for 11.4% of total cancers) and 1.8 million deaths occurred worldwide in 2020 (GLOBOCAN 2020).  NSCLC is the predominant subtype, accounting for approximately 80% -85% of all cases ( Osmani et al. 2018), with 235,760 new cases of lung cancer expected in the United States (U.S.) resulting in 131,880 deaths in 2021 (American Cancer Society Cancer Facts &amp; Figures 2021).  Similar data from Europe estimate that there were 477,534 new cases of lung cancer and 384,176 deaths in 2020 (WHO 2020).

Approximately 30% of patients with NSCLC present with resectable disease, however, their outcomes are quite poor. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate by pathologic stage (per the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer [UICC]/American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] staging, 7th edition) is 71% for Stage IB, 57% for Stage IIA, 49% for Stage IIB, and 36% for Stage IIIA ( Goldstraw et al. 2016).

## Clinical presentation

Despite progress in early detection and treatment, NSCLC is most often diagnosed at an advanced stage and has a poor prognosis (Herbst et al 2008). Once NSCLC has progressed to a locally advanced or metastatic stage there is no cure and treatment is therefore focused on extending life, delaying disease progression, and improving symptoms and quality of life.

## Management

In its early stages, NSCLC is treated surgically with curative intent.  For patients with Stage I disease, surgical treatment alone is the standard of care.  For Stage II to III disease, with a higher risk of recurrence, platinum-based chemotherapy as an adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy together with surgery is recommended to improve survival outcomes compared with surgery alone, per NCCN and ESMO guidelines (NCCN 2021; ESMO 2017). Chemotherapy regimens used in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings involve platinum-based doublets, which are the same standard of care drugs used in the metastatic setting.  According to NCCN and ESMO guidelines, cisplatin is recommended as the preferred platinum agent and carboplatin is used when cisplatin cannot be tolerated or co-morbidities exist.  Agents that have been combined with either cisplatin or carboplatin include taxanes, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, etoposide and pemetrexed.  Over a follow-up of approximately 5 years, the percentage of patients who have disease recurrence or who die after surgery remains high ranging from approximately 35% among patients with Stage IB disease to 65% among those with Stage III disease, regardless of the use of perioperative chemotherapy (Goldstraw et al. 2016).

The largest evidence for the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for resectable NSCLC comes from the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial (IALT).  Overall, 1867 patients were randomized to surgery alone or surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.  Adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy had a significantly higher progression free survival (PFS) (39.4% vs. 34.3%) at 5 years, hazard ratio (HR) 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74 -0.94, P &lt; 0.003) and OS (44.5 % vs. 40.4%) at 5 years, HR 0.86 (95% CI, 0.76 -0.98, P &lt; 0.03) (Arriagada et al. 2004).

In the Phase III Cancer and Leukaemia Group B 9633 study of adjuvant chemotherapy in Stage IB NSCLC, a survival advantage was not observed with paclitaxel and carboplatin in the intent to treat (ITT) Stage IB population (Strauss et al. 2008).  However, exploratory analysis demonstrated a significant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

survival difference in favour of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients who had tumours ≥ 4 cm in diameter (HR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.48 to 0.99).

The Phase III adjuvant E1505 study and the JIPANG study suggest that platinum-based chemotherapy continues to be the current standard of care for resectable NSCLC in patients selected by stage alone (Wakelee et al. 2017; Kenmotsu et al. 2020).  These more modern studies continue to demonstrate that no platinum-based chemotherapy doublet is superior to another and a clear ceiling has been reached for adjuvant chemotherapy.  The results from the Phase III adjuvant E1505 study did not demonstrate improved DFS or OS with the addition of bevacizumab to platinum-based chemotherapy.

The LACE initiative pooled data from five large trials of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in 4584 patients with completely resected NSCLC.  Over a median follow-up period of 5.2 years, comparing chemotherapy with no chemotherapy, the HR for OS was 0.89 (95% CI: 0. 82, 0.96; p = 0.005), corresponding to a 5year survival benefit of 5.4% from chemotherapy.  There was variation observed between the different disease stages per UICC/AJCC staging 7 th  edition (p = 0.04), with the greatest benefit for patients with Stages II and III NSCLC (HR: 0.83 for each), a more moderate effect in Stage IB (HR: 0.93), and a potential deleterious effect in Stage IA (HR: 1.40; Pignon et al. 2008).

Recently, however, for a select patient population with early-stage resectable NSCLC, targeting a specific oncogenic driver, it was shown that improvements upon the modest benefit of platinum-based chemotherapy can be achieved in the adjuvant setting.  The ADAURA trial demonstrated that patients whose NSCLC had an activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation achieved significant improvements in DFS (HR = 0.20; p &lt; 0.001) with the addition of adjuvant osimertinib with or without platinum-based chemotherapy after surgery (Wu et al. 2020).  Consequently, osimertinib was approved in the U.S. in December 2020 and in the European Union (EU) in May 2021, and represents the first targeted, biomarker-driven treatment option in early-stage EGFR-mutated lung cancer.  Thus, with new drugs such as immune checkpoint inhibitors along with patient selection by oncogenic drivers or PD-L1 status, further improvements may be seen after over 16 years without change to the standard of care for these patients with high unmet medical need.

## 2.1.2. About the product

## Pharmacological class

Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking antibody

## Mechanism of action and structure

Atezolizumab is a humanised immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody consisting of two heavy chains (448 amino acids) and two light chains (214 amino acids) and is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Atezolizumab targets human programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumour infiltrating immune cells (ICs) and tumour cells (TCs) and inhibits its interaction with its receptors programmed death1 (PD-1) and B7.1, both of which can provide inhibitory signals to T cells.

## Therapeutic indications

## Urothelial carcinoma

Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC):

- after prior platinum containing chemotherapy, or
- who are considered cisplatin ineligible, and whose tumours have a PD-L1 expression ≥ 5%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Non-small cell lung cancer

Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In patients with EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC, Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated only after failure of appropriate targeted therapies.

Tecentriq, in combination with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who do not have EGFR mutant or ALK positive NSCLC.

Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumours have a PD-L1 expression ≥ 50% TC or ≥ 10% IC and who do not have EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC.

Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR mutant or ALK positive NSCLC should also have received targeted therapies before receiving Tecentriq.

## Triple-negative breast cancer

Tecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) whose tumours have PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% and who have not received prior che motherapy for metastatic disease.

## Small cell lung cancer

Tecentriq, in combination with carboplatin and etoposide, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).

## Hepatocellular carcinoma

Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not received prior systemic therapy.

## 2.1.1. The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific advice

CHMP scientific advice on the design of IMpower010 (EMEA/H/SA/2522/5/2015/II):

CHMP advised that patients with IC2/TC2 positive tumors also be included. This has been met.

The CHMP stated that DFS as primary endpoint should, however, be supported by data on OS with adequate maturity (approximately 60% of required events) at the time of marketing authorization application (MAA). The CHMP also specified that although DFS can be considered acceptable as primary endpoint, it is necessary to obtain adequate assessment of the overall survival to exclude late futility effect of the experimental treatment. 'An IA after approximately 40% of events is not considered robust enough for adequate assessment of survival benefit. Study maturity will progress differently across prognostic subgroups. This is true for the interim efficacy analysis with an overrepresentation of patients with early progressive disease, and limited relevance in patients with relatively late progression and good prognosis. Since the study will compare an active 1-year treatment vs. observation, a too early analysis may lead to overestimation of the effect and not reflect the cure rate.  The submitted OS data are immature, the median OS has not been reached and only ~33% of required O S events have taken place at the current CCOD (interim analysis Jan. 2021).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The provided OS data in the dossier with DCO 21.1.2022 were immature with only 33% of OS events having taken place. Mature OS data are required to assess the benefit/risk in the adjuvant setting and are considered mature when a minimum of 60% of OS events have occurred, preferably 70 -80%. This was addressed in the AR and at the clarification TC at 18th November 2021.

The MAH is planning 4 interim analysis (IAs) before the final OS analysis. The MAH clarifies that the time for the first OS interim analysis is projected to occur between May and September 2022. It will be conducted when approximately 254 OS events have been observed in the ITT population (information fraction of approx imately 45%). To determine the exact CCOD of the first IA, the MAH is planning to perform an OS sweep in January 2022. The MAH will provide the OS data from this 1st IA and further planned OS analyses post-approval in case of a positive benefit/risk assessment for the now restricted indication statement to ≥ 50% PD -L1 positive stage II-IIIA (7th edition) patients.

Given the now proposed restriction of the indication to a PD-L1 ≥ 50% TC Stage II -IIIA NSCLC population, it is considered acceptable to submit further OS data post approval. The efficacy data as submitted with the initial dossier support a favourable benefit risk balance for the PD-L1 high expression subgroup even without mature OS data.

This is based on the large effect size of the treatment effect of DFS (stratified DFS HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29, 0.75),  although this analysis was only a key secondary endpoint and not included in the alpha control of the statistical testing; moreover, the sample size of this subgroup represents only about a quarter of the ITT population (all-comer Stage IB-IIIA; n=1005). However, the DFS benefit in the PD-L1 ≥ 50% TC Stage II-IIIA was further supported by OS data; although the OS results were exploratory and immature (event rates 10% and 23% in the atezolizumab and BSC ar ms, respectively), the stratified OS HR of 0.40 (95% CI 0.20, 0.81) ) is considered reassuring and it cannot be reasonable expected that the benefit as such would not be confirmed with more follow-up data (though the exact value of the treatment effect cannot be precisely determined with the current data cutoff).

The CHMP noted that the primary endpoint, DFS in all randomized patients (ITT) population, is considered acceptable for filing. The MAH has meanwhile changed the primary endpoint to DFS in the ≥ 1% PD-L1 stage II-IIIA population. The proposed indication is for all ≥ 1% PD -L1 patients, regardless of stage, so, the subgroup reflective of the primary endpoint is not identical with the subgroup reflective of the proposed indication.

The CHMP strongly argued in favour of a double-blind design vs. placebo and also stated that at least blinded assessment of relapse should be implemented. IMpower010 was conducted as an open-label trial with BSC in the control arm. Moreover, it remained uncertain whether blinded independent central review (BICR) of the data was conducted, since it was not submitted within the current application dossier. In agreement with the Guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man (p. 23/43), considering the open-label nature of this randomized phase III trial, BICR of the investigator-assessed DFS is considered crucial and the MAH submitted the BICR of approximately 50% of the patients. For the population encompassed by the revised indication (stage II-IIIA ≥ 50% PD -L1 positive patients), the concordant rate between INV-DFS and BICRDFS in terms of occurrence of an event was 92.6%. When considering the timing of the DFS events, the concordance was 86.8%. The MAH has also presented the results of the DFS analysis using the BIRC assessment. The results of these preliminary analyses are comparable to those reported using the investigator assessment.

The statistical analysis plan and assumptions were generally acceptable at the time of the advice given. However, the CHMP advised the MAH to consider genotyping (e.g. ALK and EGFR) all patients to make future exploratory analyses in different specific subgroups of patients defined by these gene aberrations possible. Nevertheless, a large fraction of the included patients (in 40.3% of patients EGFR or ALK mutation status is not reported) has not been genotyped leaving ALK and EGFR status undetermined.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary endpoint of DFS was considered acceptable for filing. However, the CHMP emphasized, that it is foreseeable that patients will be treated with other active agents upon progression under the study treatments. Namely 'cross-over' from the control arm to another anti PD-L1/PD1 is quite probable. Therefore, subsequent treatments and their efficacy must be as thoroughly recorded as possible. The MAH provided subsequent therapies for the ITT population and different subgroups. Generally, a higher proportion of patients received at least one follow-up cancer therapy in the BSC arm compared to the atezolizumab arm (e.g. 26.3% vs. 16.5% for the PD -L1 ≥ 50% TC Stage II -IIIA population) with the largest difference in the proportion of immunotherapy (16.7% vs. 3.5% in the BSC vs. the atezolizumab arm of the ≥ 50% Stage II -IIIA population).

In the PD-L1 SP263 ≥ 50% T C Stage II-IIIA population, 29 (25.4%) patients in the BSC arm and 13 (11.3%) patients in the atezolizumab arm had PFS2 events (unstratified HR 0.37; 95% CI 0.19, 0.72). Although based on low event rates, these results can be considered supportive for the benefit of atezolizumab in the revised indication of high PD-L1 expressors.

## 2.1.2. General comments on compliance with GCP

IMpower010 was conducted in accordance with the principles of the 'Declaration of Helsinki' and Good Clinical Practice.  The appropriate Ethics Committees and Institutional Review Boards reviewed and approved the study. No critical audit findings were reported in IMpower010.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Atezolizumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody produced by recombinant DNA technology, a protein with a molecular mass of ~150 kDa. As an unaltered protein, being extensively degraded in the patient's body by regular proteolytic mechanisms before excretion, atezolizumab is unlikely to result in a significant environmental exposure. Atezolizumab is expected to biodegrade in the environment and does not pose a significant risk to the environment. Thus, according to the 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00),  atezolizumab is exempt from the submission of Environmental Risk Assessment studies as the product and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the environment.

## 2.2.2. Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects

The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. According to the relevant guideline, in the case of products containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), this is acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

IMpower010 is a Phase III, open-label, randomized study to investigate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 antibody) compared with best supportive care following adjuvant cisplatinbased chemotherapy in patients with completely resected Stage IB-IIIA NSCLC.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.

The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

Atezolizumab pharmacokinetics was assessed by non-compartmental (NCA) and population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analyses.

## Analytical methods

The VENTANA PD-L1 assay was used for the qualitative immunohistochemical detection of PD-L1 by light microscopy in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissues. PD-L1 expression in NSCLC was determined as the percentage of tumor cells with any membrane staining above background.

Validated ELISA assays were used to quantify atezolizumab in human serum and for evaluation of immunogenicity status.

## Population PK analyses

Pop PK analysis was performed using a non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach with NONMEM, Version 7.3 (ICON, Maryland, USA) and Bayesian post-hoc estimation (MAXEVAL=0). Perl-speaksNONMEM Version 4.8.1 (Uppsala, Sweden) was used to evaluate/validate the popPK model using predictive checks. Data exploration and visualization, as well as descriptive statistics, were performed using R V3.6.1 in addition to CRAN packages.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In study IMpower010, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either atezolizumab 1200 mg q3w for 16 cycles (Arm A) or best supportive care (Arm B). A total of 3132 atezolizumab serum concentrations from 493 atezolizumab-treated patients were used for the popPK analysis. There were 52 post-dose samples BLQ and 29 samples were excluded for other reasons. In the final data set, 8 observations were associated with a CWRES greater than 5.

The Phase I popPK model was modified to include an effect of tumor removal after surgery on atezolizumab CL. All other fixed-effects parameters were fixed to the popPK Phase I model. Tumor burden was set to 0 in the dataset after surgery.

Covariate effects (i.e., body weight, ADA status, albumin levels, and gender) in the IMpower010 data were generally consistent with those identified in the modif ied Phase I popPK model. A 10% decrease in CL was estimated after surgery due to the removal of the tumor before the start of the adjuvant treatment (Table 2).

## Absorption

Atezolizumab is administered as an IV infusion. There have been no clinical studies performed with other routes of administration.

## Distribution

PopPK analysis indicated that V1 was 3.28 L and Vss was 6.91 L in the typical patient.

## Elimination

The metabolism of atezolizumab has not been directly studied. PopPK analysis indicated that the typical CL of atezolizumab was 0.200 L/day and the typical terminal t1/2 was 27 days.

## Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Noncompartmental analysis indicated that doses ≥1 mg/kg displayed dose -proportional PK. The popPK model estimated geometric mean accumulation ratio for Cmin, Cmax, and AUC was 2.75, 1.46, and 1.91fold, respectively, following multiple doses of 1200 mg atezolizumab q3w.

## Special populations

In the final popPK model, body weight, albumin, tumor burden, and treatment-emergent ADA were statistically significant covariates for CL; body weight and albumin were statistically significant covariates for V1; and gender was a statistically significant covariate for both V1 and V2.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

No pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been submitted.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Primary and secondary pharmacology

## Pharmacokinetics by treatment-emergent  ADA status

The analysis of observed exposure by ADA status shows that there was lower exposure in the ADApositive subgroup compared with the ADA-negative subgroup (Figure 5); a statistical t-test of clearance and exposure by ADA was performed and predicted a statistically significant difference between the ADApositive and ADA-negative subgroups; demonstrating higher clearance and lower exposure in the ADApositive subgroup (Table 6). However, the vast majority of patients had Cmin above the TE of 6 µg/mL, regardless of ADA status.

## 2.3.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The bioanalytical reports of sample analysis conducted in clinical study IMpower010 included determination of biomarkers e.g. PD-L1 (SP142), PD-L1 (SP263), serum concentrations of atezolizumab and results of ADA testing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Samples from 108 patients were evaluated for PD-L1 (SP142), of these 71 patients were determined as negative and 37 were determined as positive. 73 patients were evaluated for PD-L1 (SP263). Upon request of the study team, 933 of the samples initially tested with TC2/IC2 were reanalysed with a different scoring algorithm (TC1/IC1 or TC2/IC2). Due to a Ventana dispenser issue, further 222 samples were retested and rescored. Results of PD-L1 testing were only reported via data transfer.

Validated ELISA assays were used to quantify atezolizumab in human serum and for evaluation of immunogenicity status. The bioanalysis analysis conducted in support of clinical study IMpower010 is considered acceptable with a few minor exceptions.

The Phase I Pop PK model for atezolizumab was fitted to the concentration data from study IMpower010 (3132 atezolizumab serum concentrations from 493 atezolizumab-adjuvant treated patients). The concentrations were predominately sampled within Cycle 1. The model was modified to include an effect of tumor removal and tumor burden was set to zero in the data set. The effect of tumor removal after surgery on CL was estimated to 0.897 (10% decrease in CL). No new covariates were identified. The modified model could adequately describe the IMpower010 data and was used to predict exposure metrics at Cycle 1 and at steady state using Cycle 1 data.

The mean concentrations (Cmax, Cmin) achieved in study IMpower010 were slightly higher compared to concentrations achieved across studies where atezolizumab were given as 1200 mg q3w. This was observed throughout the treatment period. Clearance of atezolizumab is known to be affected by tumor burden and disease status which likely explain the slightly higher serum concentrations observed in IMpower010.

Of 487 atezolizumab treated ADA-evaluable patients in IMpower010, 152 patients were confirmed ADApositive which is about 30% of the ADA -evaluable population. Exposure was slightly lower in the ADApositive sub-population compared to the ADA-negative sub-population.

The provided NAB results shows that among 481 ADA and NAbevaluable patients, 107 patients (22%) were ADA-positive/NAbpositive and 39 patients (8%) were ADA -positive/NAb-negative. In the PD-L1 SP263≥50% TC Stag e IIIIIA population, 20 patients (18%) out of 122 patients were ADA positive/NAb positive while 10 patients (9%) were ADA -positive/NAb-negative. In the PDL1 SP263 ≥1% TC Stage II -IIIA population, 48 patients (20%) were ADA positive/NAb positive while 17 patients (7%) were ADA -positive/NAb-negative. This does not give raise to any concern.

No clinically meaningful ER relationships were identified in previous monotherapy and combination therapies; therefore, no ER analysis was conducted for IMpower010. Furthermore, no new safety finding was observed in IMpower010.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Supportive Care Following Adjuvant Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy in Patients with Completely Resected Stage IB-IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

## Methods

IMpower010 is a Phase III, global, multicenter, open-label, randomized study comparing the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab versus (best supportive care) BSC in patients with Stage IB (tumors ≥ 4 cm) - Stage IIIA NSCLC as per the AJCC 7 th  edition, following complete resection and adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy.  The study consists of two phases : an enrollment phase and randomized phase.

In the enrollment phase , patients who had recently undergone complete resection of their NSCLC were screened, and eligible patients were enrolled to receive one of four regimens of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (cisplatin plus vinorelbine, docetaxel, gemcitabine, or pemetrexed; based on investigator choice).

The randomized phase (randomized 1:1) started after patients had completed their cisplatin-based chemotherapy (up to 4 cycles) and were still considered eligible to proceed with randomization.

Stratification factors included sex, tumour histology, stage of disease according to AJCC 7 th  edition and PD-L1 expression according to SP142 testing result.

Patients in the atezolizumab arm received atezolizumab 1200 mg by intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 every 3 weeks (q3w) for a total of 16 cycles.  Patients in the BSC arm received no treatment during the randomized phase other than best supportive care and were continuously followed starting on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle (considered as observation period) for one year followed by survival follow-up.  Cross over to the atezolizumab arm was not permitted.

To ensure the same frequency of study assessments between the treatment arms, including assessments for disease recurrence and safety, patients in the BSC arm were required to undergo medical contact q3w for assessments during the first year for symptom and adverse event (AE) assessment.

The study design is depicted in Figure 6.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

IC = tumor-infiltrating immune cell; IV = i ntravenous; NSCLC = non -small cell lung cancer; PD-L1 = programmed death -ligand 1; q3w = every 3 weeks; TC = tumor cell. Note: Patients received up to four cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy unless unacceptable toxicity, disease relapse, or patient's decision to discontinue occurred.

Tumour assessments were performed by the investigator every 4 months in the first year and every 6 months in the second year after randomization through Year 5 and annually starting from Year 6. Additional scans could be performed if recurrence of disease was suspected.

Patients from both treatment arms underwent a mandatory tumor biopsy sample collection, unless not clinically feasible as assessed by investigators, at the first evidence of radiographic disease recurrence.

Patients who discontinued treatment before completing the 16 cycles of atezolizumab for reasons other than disease recurrence (e.g., toxicity) continued scheduled tumor assessments until disease recurrence,

death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or until the study closes, whichever occurred first, regardless of whether patients started a new anti-cancer therapy.

All patients in the randomized phase were followed for OS and other anti-cancer treatments, approximately every 3 months until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurred first.

## Treatments

## Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy

During the enrollment phase, eligible, surgically resected patients were to receive one of four cisplatinbased chemotherapy options (see Table below). Patients received up to four cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (unless unacceptable toxicity, disease relapse or patient's decision to discontinue occurred), with each cycle being 3 weeks (21 days) in length. The investigator selected the chemotherapy regimen (cisplatin plus either vinorelbine, docetaxel, gemcitabine or pemetrexed) for the patient prior to enrollment.

## Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy Regimens

IV=intravenous; NSCLC=non-small cell lung cancer.

## Atezolizumab

During the randomization phase, patients randomized to the atezolizumab arm received 1200 mg atezolizumab by IV infusion on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle. Atezolizumab was infused over 60 (±15) minutes for the first infusion, and if tolerated subsequent infusions were administered over 30 (±10) minutes.

## Objectives

The primary efficacy objective of the study was as follows:

- To evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab monotherapy treatment compared with BSC as measured by DFS as assessed by the investigator in the PDL1 subpopulation (defined as ≥1% TC expression by the SP263 IHC assay) within the Stage II-IIIA population, in all randomized patients with Stage II  IIIA NSCLC, and in the ITT population.

The secondary efficacy objectives of the study were to evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab monotherapy treatment compared with BSC on the basis of the following outcome measures:

- OS in the ITT population
- 3-year and 5-year DFS rates in the PDL1 subpopulation (defined as ≥1% TC expression by the SP263 IHC assay) within the Stage II-IIIA population, in all randomized patients with Stage IIIIIA NSCLC, and in the ITT population
- DFS in the PD-L1 subpopulation (defined as ≥50% TC expression by the SP263 IHC assay) in patients with Stage II-IIIA NSCLC

- Overall Survival in the PD-L1 SP263 ≥ 1% TC Stage II -IIIA Population
- Overall Survival in the All Randomized Stage II-IIIA Population

## Sample size

Approximately 1280 patients are expected to be accrued during the enrollment phase. With an approximate 21% dropout rate during adjuvant cisplatin -based chemotherapy, approximately 1005 patients will enter the randomization phase, including approximately 882 patients in the Stage II-IIIA population, and within Stage II-IIIA NSCLC patients, approximately 474 patients in the PD-L1 subpopulation (≥1% TC expression) defined by the SP263 IHC assay. Emerging data from atezolizumab first-line NSCLC Phase III Study GO29431 (IMpower110; Herbst et al. 2019; Spigel et al. 2019) have

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

observed clinical benefit with atezolizumab monotherapy in PD-L1 TC-defined subgroups. The TC-based assay SP263 appeared to capture a broader patient population with similar efficacy as compared to SP142. These findings are consistent with results observed in other PD-L1/PD-1 studies. With these data external to Study GO29431 and evolving biomarker landscape, the primary analysis of DFS in the PD-L1 subgroups (TC2/3 or IC2/3, TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3) defined by SP142 will be replaced with DFS in the PD-L1 subgroup (≥ 1% TC expression) defined by SP263.

The estimates of the number of events required to demonstrate efficacy with regard to DFS are based on the following assumptions:

- 1:1 randomization ratio
- One-sided significance level of 0.025 in the PDL1 subpopulation defined by SP263 TC ≥ 1% within the Stage II-IIIA population, the randomized Stage II-IIIA population, and the ITT population.

For Stage II-IIIA:

- 89.8% power to detect an HR of 0.65, c orresponding to an improvement in median DFS from 34 months to 52 months in the PDL1 subpopulation defined by SP263 TC ≥ 1% within the Stage II -IIIA population
- 90.7% power to detect an HR of 0.73, corresponding to an improvement in median DFS from 34 months to 46.6 months in the all-randomized Stage II-IIIA population

For Stage IB-IIIA:

- 76.4% power to detect an HR of 0.78, corresponding to an improvement in median DFS from 38 months to 48.7 months in the ITT population
- One DFS interim analysis to be perfor med when approximately 80% of the total DFS events in the primary efficacy analysis populations required for the primary analysis have occurred.
- Dropout rate of 5% per 24 months

The estimates of the number of events required to demonstrate efficacy with regard to OS are based on the following assumptions:

- 1:1 randomization ratio
- One-sided significance level of 0.025 in the ITT population (i.e., Stage IB-IIIA)
- 77% power to detect an HR of 0.78, corresponding to an improvement in median OS from 66 months to 84.6 months in the ITT population
- Four interim OS analyses to be performed, one at the time of the DFS interim analysis, the second one at the time of DFS final analysis, and the other two when approximately 73% and 88% of the total OS events required for the final analysis have occurred, respectively.
- Dropout rate of 5% per 36 months

With these assumptions, the DFS final analysis will be conducted when approximately 237 DFS events in the PDL1 subpopulation (defined by SP263 TC≥ 1%) within the Stage II -IIIA population have been observed. This is expected to occur approximately 68 months after the first patient is randomized. This number of events corresponds to a minimum detectable difference in HR of approximately 0. 758 in the PD-L1 subpopulation within the Stage II-IIIA population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Given the sample size of 1005, the final OS analysis will be conducted when approximately 564 OS events in the all randomized Stage IB-IIIA population have occurred, which is expected at approximately 121 months after the first patient is randomized.

## Randomisation

Randomization to the treatment and control arms occured in a 1:1 ratio with use of a permuted-block randomization method. Randomization was stratified by the following factors:

- Sex (female vs. male)
- Tumour histology (squamous vs. non-squamous)
- Extent of disease (Stage IB (tumours ≥4 cm) vs. Stage II vs. Stage IIIA)
- PD-L1 tumour expression status (TC2/3 and any IC vs. TC0/1 and IC2/3 vs. TC0/1 and IC0/1 using the SP142 IHC assay)

## Blinding (masking)

The study is open-label.

## Statistical methods

## Analysis populations

The ITT population is defined as all randomized patients with resected Stage IB (tumours ≥ 4 cm) - IIIA NSCLC, whether or not the patient received the assigned treatment. Patients will be grouped by their assigned treatment at randomization by the IxRS.

The Stage II-IIIA population is defined as all randomized patients with extent of disease as either Stage II or Stage III, and is a subset of the ITT population.

The PD-L1 SP263 biomarker-evaluable population in Stage II-IIIA is defined as all randomized patients from the Stage II-IIIA population who have a valid PD-L1 SP263 measurement at baseline. Similarly, the PD-L1 SP142 biomarker-evaluable population in ITT is defined as all randomized patients from the ITT population who have a valid PD-L1 SP142 measurement at baseline.

## Stratification factors in the primary analysis

To manage the small strata size with the consideration of prognostic significance, stratified analyses for DFS in the PD-L1 subpopulati on defined by SP263 TC ≥ 1% in Stage II -IIIA NSCLC and stratified analyses for DFS in Stage II-IIIA NSCLC will use the following stratification factors at randomization: stage (II vs. IIIA), sex (female vs. male), and histology (squamous vs. non-squamous).

Stratified analyses for DFS in the ITT population will use the following stratification factors at randomization: stage (IB and II combined vs. IIIA), sex (female vs. male), histology (squamous vs. nonsquamous), and PD-L1 tumour expression status by SP142 IHC assay ([TC2/3 and any IC, TC0/1 and IC2/3 combined] vs. TC0/1 and IC0/1).

Stratified analyses of DFS in other PDL1 subpopulations (e.g., SP263 TC &gt; 50% in Stage II -IIIA NSCLC) will use the same set of stratification factors used for the stratified analyses of DFS in the PD-L1 subpopulation defined by SP263 TC ≥1% in Stage II -IIIA NSCLC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The set of stratification factors used in the stratified analyses of DFS for a specific analysis population (e.g., the ITT population) will be applied to all other efficacy endpoints where stratified analyses are planned for the same analysis population.

## Primary efficacy endpoint DFS

The null and alternative hypotheses regarding DFS in each population can be phrased in terms of the DFS survival functions SA(t) in the atezolizumab arm (Arm A) and SB(t) in the control arm (Arm B), respectively:

H0: SA(t) = SB(t) versus H1: SA(t) &gt; SB(t)

Treatment comparisons will be based on the stratified log-rank test. The HR will be estimated with use of a stratified Cox regression model, including a twosided 95% CI. The stratification factors used for the analysis are described in Section 4.4. The results for unstratified analysis will also be presented. KaplanMeier methodology will be used to estimate the median DFS for each treatment arm and the Kaplan-Meier curve will be constructed to provide a visual description of the difference between the treatment and control arms. Brookmeyer-Crowley methodology will be used to construct the twosided 95% CI for the median DFS for each treatment arm.

## Censoring rules for DFS

Data for patients who are not reported as experiencing disease recurrence, a new primary NSCLC, or death will be censored at the date of the last tumour assessment. If no post-baseline data are available, DFS will be censored at the date of randomization. If recurrence of disease or new primary NSCLC prior to randomization is documented, DFS will be censored at the date of randomization.

## Sensitivity analyses for DFS

- Loss to follow-up on DFS: The impact of loss to follow up will be assessed depending on the number of patients who are lost to followup. If &gt; 5% of patients are lost to follow -up for DFS in either treatment arm, a sensitivity analysis ('worse-case' analysis) will be performed in which patients who are lost to follow-up will be considered to have recurrent disease at the date of the last tumour assessment.
- Missed Visits for DFS: To evaluate the impact of missed visits, sensitivity analyses with a different censoring rule will be performed for the primary endpoint of DFS. Data for patients with a DFS event who missed two or more scheduled assessments immediately prior to the DFS event will be censored at the last date with adequate radiologic assessment prior to the missed visits.

## Secondary endpoint OS

The methodology used for DFS will be applied to OS in the ITT population.

## Censoring rules for OS

Data for patients who are not reported as having died at the date of analysis will be censored at the date when they were last known to be alive. If no post-baseline data are available, OS will be censored at the date of randomization.

## Type I error control

The overall type I error rate will be controlled for the one-sided test at 0.025. The overview of the alpha control is shown in Figure 2.

## Interim analyses for DFS

There will be one planned interim DFS analysis in the study. To control the type I error for DFS at a onesided alpha of 0.025, the stopping boundaries for the interim and final DFS analyses are to be computed with use of the Hwang-Shih-DeCani alpha spending function with the gamma parameter of -0.9 as shown in Table 10. Boundaries will be adjusted based on observed numbers of DFS events, and the exact timing of this analysis will depend on the occurrence of DFS events.

## Interim analyses for OS

Four interim OS efficacy analyses are planned. The exact timing of these OS analyses will depend on the occurrence of OS events. If a significantly smaller number of OS events (&lt; 224 events) is observed at the first OS IA, a nominal one-sided type I error of 0.00005 will be assigned to test the first OS IA; all the following OS analyses will be conducted based on the pre-specified number of events in Table 11.

## SAP Appendix 5: Modification plan

On the basis of results observed from the ongoing Phase III studies as presented in Table 1, the Sponsor may be able to improve the design of the ongoing IMpower010.

The possible modifications to IMpower010 are discussed in Section 2. These modifications include the PDL1-selected and ITT populations for the primary endpoint of DFS and secondary endpoint of OS to be tested in a different order, and/or with a different alpha control method, and/or different analysis timing than what is specified in Section 6 of the current Protocol GO29527 (Version 8).

The proposed modifications to IMpower010 as outlined in this Modification Plan will be based on data generated outside of the study, with the exception of cumulative population-level PD-L1 expression prevalence data in the combined treatment arms based on ongoing study monitoring. No modifications will be based on any interim analysis of IMpower010. As such, this study is not considered an adaptive design clinical study as defined in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's February 2010 draft guidance 'Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics' and in the European Medicines Agency's October 2007 'Reflection Paper on Methodological Issues in Confirmatory Clinical Trials Planned with an Adaptive Design.' Any modification derived from data entirely outside of IMpower010 will not result in statistical bias (e.g., the type I error will not be inflated).

## Subsequent Non-Protocol Anti-Cancer Therapy

In the ITT population, more patients in the BSC arm (27%) compared with the atezolizumab arm (21%) received at least one non-protocol anti-cancer systemic therapy at any time during the course of the study with the most commonly used agent being carboplati n (12% vs. 9%).

Followup radiotherapy was received by more patients on BSC (17%) compared with atezolizumab (11%), with the most common sites being to the brain, lungs, bone and lymph nodes.

Follow-up surgery was reported for a similar proportion of pati ents in both arms (7% BSC vs 5% atezolizumab), with the most common sites being to the brain (2%) and lungs (3%).

## Clinical studies in special populations

No dedicated studies were conducted in special populations.

In IMpower 010, the ≥ 65 years population was: 198 (39.8%) in the arm BSC and 184 (36.3%) in the atezolizumab arm, a total of 382/1005 (38.0%) patients.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The Applicant is seeking an extension of indication to include treatment with atezolizumab monotherapy for one year as adjuvant treatment with the following initial indication:

Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated as adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumours have PD-L1 expression on ≥ 1% of tumour cells (TC).

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The Applicant submitted an interim analysis of the pivotal study, Impower010, a phase III, open label, multi-centre, randomised study, GO29527 (IMpower010), was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab for the adjuvant treatment of patients with stage IB (tumours ≥ 4 cm) -IIIA NSCLC (per the Union for International Cancer Control/American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system, 7th edition). Patients were recruited from 204 centers across 21 countries.

The stratification factors (stage, sex, histology and PD-L1 status according to SP142) are considered relevant. The number of patients in PD-L1 subgroups defined by the SP263 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay were generally balanced between treatment arms in the ITT population (n= 1005).

The demographics and baseline disease characteristics in the ITT population were well balanced between the treatment arms. T he median age was 62 years (range: 26 to 84), and 67% of patients were male. The majority of patients were White (73%), and 24% were Asian. Most patients were current or previous smokers (78%) and baseline ECOG performance status in patients was 0 (55%) or 1 (44%). Overall, 12% of patients had stage IB, 47% had stage II and 41% had stage IIIA disease. The percentage of patients who had tumours with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% and ≥ 50% on TC as measured by the VENTANA PDL1 (SP263) Assay was 55% and 26%, respecti vely.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The open-label design of the phases III randomized study was not recommended by the Rapporteurs, and the applicant was advised to implement a blinded independent central review (BICR). The primary efficacy endpoint is investigator-assessed DFS and a retrospective blinded independent central review of DFS was performed.

The primary endpoint of DFS was accepted, although clarifying, that it would be of major importance that a gain in DFS translated into a gain in OS. The MAH presented preliminary BIRC results for approximately 50% of the original ITT population (514 patients of 1005 included in the ITT). The concordant rate between INV-DFS and BICRDFS in terms of occurrence of an event was 92.6%. When considering the timing of the DFS events, the conco rdance was 86.8%. The MAH also presented results of the DFS analysis using the BIRC assessment. These preliminary analyses are comparable to those reported using the investigator assessment and therefore considered valid. The statistical methods implemented to analyse DFS and OS are endorsed.

The provided OS data in the dossier with DCO 21.01.2021 were granted immature (33% of OS events). The MAH plans to perform additional interim analyses (IAs) of OS before the final OS analysis, and has accepted to submit final DFS and updated and final OS data post-approval.

Seven (7) amendments, were made to the protocol during the study period. Changes in study population, primary endpoint, testing hierarchy, and the addition and timing of interim analyses were made, in addition to changing the PD-L1 testing method (from SP142 to SP263). According to the MAH, the changes were guided only by external data from other studies on atezolizumab. The MAH presented the analyses that would have been performed according to protocol versions 1-4, 5-6 and 7. The results for the DFS analyses were concordant, i.e. in all cases, the primary test remained statistically significant. These analyses do not raise concerns regarding data-driven protocol changes, but suggest the lack of benefit for patients with stage IB and confirm the association of better efficacy outcomes with higher PDL1 expression status.

Overall, the design and conduct of the study are acceptable. The patient population was adequately selected without an age limit for inclusion, the comparator arm was considered appropriate.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The primary endpoints of DFS in PD-L1 ≥ 1% positive stage II -IIIA NSCLC patients, and DFS in all randomized stage II-IIIA any degree of PD-L1 status NSCLC patients, were both met. The Primary endpoint of DFS in the ITT population (Stage IB (tumour size ≥ 4 cm)-IIIA, any degree of PD-L1 status) was not met. Furthermore, more deaths were observed in the atezolizumab arm compared to the BSC arm in the OS analysis. This indicated that certain subgroups (patients with: stage IB (by 7 th  edition AJCC), &lt;50% PD -L1 expression, EGFR and ALK mutations) in the ITT population did not seem to benefit from the experimental arm.

The MAH provided data of subsequent therapies and PFS2 for the ITT population and subgroups. Generally, a higher proportion of patients received at least one follow-up cancer therapy in the BSC arm compared to the atezolizumab arm (e.g. 26.3% vs. 16.5% for the PD -L1 ≥ 50% TC Stage II -IIIA population) with the largest difference in the proportion of immunotherapy (16.7% vs. 3.5% in the BSC vs. the atezolizumab arm of the ≥ 50% Stage II -IIIA population). In the PD-L1 ≥ 50% TC Stage II-IIIA population, 29 (25.4%) patients in the BSC arm and 13 (11.3%) patients in the atezolizumab arm had PFS2 events (unstratified HR 0.37; 95% CI 0.19, 0.72). Although based on low event rates, these results can be considered supportive for the benefit of atezolizumab in the subgroup of patients with high PD-L1 expression.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In view of the immature OS data, the MAH was asked for metastasis-free survival (MFS) data and could provide results of MFS as exploratory analyses for the ITT and different subpopulations. In the PD-L1 ≥ 50% TC stage II-IIIA population, results support the DFS benefit (MFS HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.24, 0.74; event rates 34.2% vs 15.7% in the SOC vs the atezolizumab arm). A MFS benefit was less clear in other populations (HR 0.72 for PD-L1 ≥ 1% TC Stage II -IIIA, 0.86 for Stage II-IIIA, 0.90 for ITT and notably 1.0 for 149% TC II -IIIA). In the subgroup of the stage IB and the PD-L1 149% positive patients, more deaths were seen in the atezolizumab arm than in the BSC arm and no differences were seen in DFS.

At the SA meeting,  the MAH was advised to test all included patients for driver mutations (ALK and EGFR). In the submitted data EGFR and ALK status was known for 60% of the patients . From the forest plots, it seems that patients with EGFR or ALK mutations do not benefit from adjuvant treatment with atezolizumab.

The patient group that seems to drive the DFS benefit from adjuvant atezolizumab encompasses 209 of the initial 1005 randomized patients; 106 in the atezolizumab arm and 103 in the BSC arm. Median DFS was NE (NE-NE)  in the atezolizumab arm and 37.3 (30.1-NE)  months in the BSC arm, stratified HR=0.49 95% CI: (0.29 -0.81) and the 3year DFS proportions are 75.1% and 50.4%, respectively. An exploratory analysis of OS sugg ested a trend in favor of atezolizumab over BSC, with a stratified HR of 0.39 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.82). The OS forest plot of subgroups in these patient pool showed point estimates &lt;1 for all subgroups except for the small group of current smokers (HR 1.28; 95 % CI 0.32, 5.11).

Based on clinical interpretation from the abovementioned subgroup analyses, it was agreed with the MAH to restrict the indication to patients who exhibited a favourable benefit/risk balance from adjuvant atezolizumab, i.e., stage II-IIIA (7 th  edition AJCC), PDL1 high (≥50%) and without  EGFR or ALK mutations. This is based on the large effect size of the treatment on DFS (stratified DFS HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.29-0.81), acknowledging this analysis was only a key secondary endpoint and not included in the alpha control of the statistical testing; moreover, the sample size of this subgroup (n=209) represents only about 20% of the ITT population (n=1005). However, the DFS benefit was further supported by OS data; although exploratory and immature ( event rates 9% and 23% in the atezolizumab and BSC arms, respectively), with a stratified OS HR of 0.39 (95% CI 0.18 -0.82).  This is considered reassuring, and it can be reasonably expected that the benefit supports the restricted indication. Nevertheless, OS data are immature  and final DFS and updated OS data are requested to reassure these conclusions, also because data come from analyses in a subgroup of the ITT. The MAH has committed to provide final analysis of DFS and 2 nd  interim analysis of OS as a recommendation, expected in August 2024.

The indication wording agreed upon the previous discussion states:

Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated as adjuvant treatment following complete resection and platinumbased chemotherapy for adult patients with NSCLC with a high risk of recurrence whose tumours have PDL1 expression on ≥ 50% of tumour cells (TC) and who do not ha ve EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC (see section 5.1 for selection criteria).

The following selection criteria define patients with high risk of recurrence who are included in the therapeutic indication and are reflective of the patient population with stage II - IIIA according to the 7th edition staging system:

Tumour size ≥ 5 cm; or tumours of any size that are either accompanied by N1 or N2 status; or tumours that are invasive of thoracic structures (directly invade the parietal pleura, chest wall, diaphragm, phrenic nerve, mediastinal pleura, parietal pericardium, mediastinum, heart, great vessels, trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, oesophagus, vertebral body, carina); or tumours that involve the main bronchus &lt; 2 cm distal to the carina but without  involvement of the carina; or tumours that are associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis of the entire lung; or tumours with separate nodule(s) in the same lobe or different ipsilateral lobe as the primary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study did not include patients who had N2 status with tumours invading the mediastinum, heart, great vessels, trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, oesophagus, vertebral body, carina, or with separate tumour nodule(s) in a different ipsilateral lobe.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The data presented in the interim analysis (CCOD January 2021) support the adjuvant treatment with atezolizumab as monotherapy for one year following resection and platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy for adult patients with stage II-IIIA (7 th  edi tion AJCC) ≥50% PD -L1 positive NSCLC although, OS is still immature. Furthermore, the very limited data of the EGFR and ALK mutated patients showed no benefit for this patient group which is excluded from the approved indication. The MAH is recommended to submit final data on DFS and updated and final OS data post-approval.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

Tecentriq received a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU on 21 September 2017.

For this application, the safety of Tecentriq (atezolizumab) monotherapy in subjects with Stage IB (tumors ≥4 cm) -Stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (as per UICC/AJCC staging system, 7th edition) following complete resection and up to 4 cycles of adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy is based on the Study GO29527 (hereinafter IMpower010).

In addition to IMpower010, pooled safety data for the following populations are provided as part of the comprehensive safety evaluation:

- Single-agent atezolizumab regardless of tumour type (n=2616); hereinafter referred to as Atezo Mono 1 population.  The Atezo Mono 1 comprises safety data which informs the Warnings and Precautions section of the currently approved U.S. Prescribing Information.
- Single-agent atezolizumab regardless of tumour type (n=3178); hereinafter referred to as Atezo Mono 2 population (Atezo Mono 1 + GO29294 (IMVIGOR211) + wo29074 (IMMOTION150 RCC ATEZO MONO ARM B prior to crossover)).

Safety data from the atezolizumab arm and BSC arm of IMpower010 are summarized and displayed side by side with the two pooled atezolizumab monotherapy populations described above.  The pooled populations allow for a comprehensive characterization of the safety profile of atezolizumab when given as monotherapy.

The enrolled safety-evaluable population is defined as all eligible patients who entered the enrollment phase and who received at least one dose of chemotherapy (cisplatin, vinorelbine, docetaxel, gemcitabine, or pemetrexed), regardless of whether they are subsequently randomized or not.

The randomized safety evaluable population is defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of atezolizumab and all randomized patients who were randomized to the control arm and did not receive any dose of atezolizumab but who had at least one post baseline safety assessment (e.g., adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs), regardless of their assigned treatment at randomization (atezolizumab/BSC).

## Patient exposure

After randomization the patients in the atezolizumab arm received atezolizumab 1200 mg by intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 every 3 weeks (q3w) for a total of 16 cycles.  Patients in the BSC arm received no treatment during the randomized phase other than best supportive care and were continuously followed starting on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle (considered as observation period) for one year followed by survival follow-up.  Cross over to the atezolizumab arm was not permitted.

To ensure the same frequency of study assessments between the treatment arms, including assessments for disease recurrence and safety, patients in the BSC arm were required to undergo medical contact q3w for assessments during the first year for symptom and adverse event (AE) assessment.

The median duration of treatment was longer in the atezolizumab arm of IMpower010 (10.4 months) where patients were treated in the adjuvant setting compared with Atezo Mono pooled populations (3.5 months each), where metastatic patients with disease present were treated until disease progression or loss of clinical benefit. The median number of atezolizumab doses administered was 16 in IMpower010 (maximum allowed per protocol) and was 6 in the Atezo Mono pooled populations.

## ADA and safety

Descriptive analyses were performed at the trial level evaluating demographics, pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and safety by treatment-emergent ADA-positive and ADA-negative subgroups, and the results are reported in the CSR.

Serum samples were collected from patients before, during and after atezolizumab treatment to characterize atezolizumab ADA baseline prevalence and atezolizumab PK and ADA incidence posttreatment.

Safety by ADA subgroup analyses are based on ADA-evaluable patients, defined as patients with at least one post-baseline atezolizumab ADA result, in the safety evaluable population (i.e., treated patients).

## Laboratory findings

Overall, few patients experienced clinically relevant shifts from baseline (defined as shifts from Grade 0, 1, or 2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 post baseline) in any laboratory safety test parameter during study treatment. The frequency of clinically relevant shift was similar between the arms except for a higher (≥2%) incidence of increased ALT, increased AST, and low lymphocyte count in the atezolizumab arm; see Table 77.

Baseline is the patient's last observation prior to initiation of study drug. For each laboratory test, patients with at ieast l post-baseline assessment are included in the analysis. For each cell, the denominator is the number of patients with baseline values with NCICTCAE Grade 0-2 in the specified direction of abnormality. Patients with missing baseline values are counted as Grade 0-2 at baseline.

Blood samples for thyroid function assessment were collected routinely (every 4 cycles) for only patients in the atezolizumab arm; in the BSC arm, samples were collected only when clinically indicated.

Overall, the majority of patients (79.0%) on atezolizumab maintained normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels during the study (Table 78).

## Post marketing experience

Atezolizumab is globally approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC after prior chemotherapy, as well as first-line (1L) treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC in combination with chemotherapy either with or without bevacizumab.  Atezolizumab is also globally approved for the treatment of a variety of other cancers, including small cell lung cancer, urothelial cancer (UC), triple-negative breast cancer, melanoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Since the International Birth Date (18 May 2016) through 17 May 2020, an estimated cumulative total of 106,316 patients have received atezolizumab from marketing experience (United States n=54,910; European Union n=25,768; Japan n=9,543; Rest of the World n=16,095).

No new or unexpected safety findings were identified in the post marketing setting for atezolizumab used as a monotherapy (Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report).

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The randomized safety evaluable population from Study GO29527 (IMpower010) is defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of atezolizumab (n=495) and all randomized patients who were randomized to the control arm (n=495) and did not receive any dose of atezolizumab but who had at least one post baseline safety assessment (e.g., adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs), regardless of their assigned treatment at randomization (atezolizumab/BSC). During the randomization phase, patients randomized to the atezolizumab arm received 1200 mg atezolizumab by IV infusion on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle.

The median follow-up of this study was 32.2 months. The median duration of study treatment in IMpower010 was 10.4 months and the number of median doses were 16.

Single-agent atezolizumab regardless of tumour type has been evaluated in a total of 3178 patients, referred to as the pooled population. All patients had advanced disease.

In the safety dataset of IMpower010 (N=990),  common AEs were reported for ≥10% of patients including cough (13.3%), pyrexia (13 . 1%), hypothyroidism (11.1%), aspartate aminotransferase increased/alanine amin otransferase increased (10.7% for both) and arthralgia (10.5%). In the pooled populations the most common AEs were fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, dyspnoea, pyrexia and constipation which is as expected in a patient population with advanced disease. The proportion of patients with Grade 3-4 AEs in the atezo arm (21.8%) was higher than the BSC arm (11.5%). The most common Grade 3 -4 AEs by PT (›1% of patients in either arm) were (BSC arm vs. atezo arm, respectively): pneumonia (0.6% vs. 1.4%), increased ALT (0.2% vs. 1.6%), increased AST (0% vs. 1.4%), rash (0% vs. 1%) and hypertension (0.4% vs. 1%).

Adverse events of special interest ( AESI ) for atezo were selected based on its mechanism of action. The total number of AESI was 51.7%.  However the majority of AEs were of Grade 1-2. At the time of CCOD of January 2021, the proportion of unresolved AESI were overall comparable between the atezo arm of IMpower010 and the atezo pooled populations (16% vs. 15.3%, respectively). The majority of ongoing AESIs were low-grade immune-mediated endocrinopathies. At CCOD, three patients had unresolved Grade 3 AESIS (AST increased, pneumonitis and immune-mediated Guillain-Barre Syndrome). AESI requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids was seen in 12.1% compared with 7.5% and 7.8% in the Atezo pooled population, respectively. The majority of the AESI for which atezo arm patients of IMpower010 received corticosteroids were Grade 1-2 in severity. It is possible that patients being treated in the adjuvant setting, being relatively healthier, may be more susceptible to developing immunemediated AEs. This is consistent with what has been observed in adjuvant studies of other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Grade 3-4 AESI and serious AESI were seen in 7.9% and 4.2% in the Atez o

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

arm, respectively. This was consistent with what was seen in the pooled population (7.8% and 4.8%, respectively). Grade 5 AE with fatal outcome was seen in 2 patients (0.4%). This was higher than the incidences reported in the pooled population (5 patien ts, 0.2%). When comparing incidences of imAEs between the experimental arm of IMpower010 and the pooled atezolizumab population, a relatively higher rates of uncommon, but clinically relevant immune-related events are notable, such as immunerelated adrena l insufficiency (1.2% vs. 0.4%), myositis (0.8% vs. 0.3%), diabetes mellitus (0.8% vs. 0.3%), meningoencephalitis (0.8% vs 0.4%), encephalitis (0.4% vs &lt;0.1%), myocarditis (0.4% vs. 0%) and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (0.4% vs. 0.1%).  However, when avai lable, all time to onset values observed in the serious AESIs of IMpower010 were within the data range of the atezo Mono pooled populations, except for a longer time to onset for immune mediated adrenal insufficiency. The majority of the patients with a serious AESI (19 of 21) in the atezo arm of IMpower010 had resolution of serious AESIs at the time of the clinical data cut-off date, although two serious AESIs remained unresolved, which included one event of pneumonitis and one event of Guillain Barre syndrome. The MAH will submit updated analyses of immune-related AESIs with the final DFS analysis.

The proportion of patients with at least one SAE was 17.6% in the Atezo arm compared with 8.5% in the BSC arm vs. 41.2% in the pooled population. The most common SAE was infections/infestations in 5.7% of the patients treated with atezolizumab (11.6% in the pooled population). The most frequent infection in the atezo arm was pneumonia in 1.6% (vs. 3.9% and 3.5%) of the patients. Patients in the BSC arm did not receive any treatment during the randomization phase, whereas patients in the study arm continued to receive atezo on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle.  Therefore, the number of SAEs is expectedly higher in the atezo arm.  Across both arms, most patients with SA Es had their SAEs resolved (83.9%) or resolving at the time (6.9%), unresolved (6.9%) and resolved with sequelae (4.6%) at the clinical data cut-off date.

The proportion of deaths were well balanced between the 2 arms of IMpower010 (19.2% in the Atezo arm vs. 18.2% in the BSC arm) with the majority of deaths occurring ›30 days from last study treatment/safety visit (18.4% and 17.2%, respectively). The most c ommon primary cause of death was disease relapse (12.7% vs. 15,6%). AEs was the cause in 8 (1.6%) and 3 (0.6%) patients. 4 patients in the BSC arm and 8 patients in the atezo arm died of unknown/limited death information, respectively. It is not optimal that the causes of death are unclear in an adjuvant study where the ultimate purpose is an improvement of OS. However, the numbers are small and unlikely to change the overall conclusions. The higher rate of 0.8% (4 patients) with atezolizumab related Grade  5 AEs (compared to 0.3% in the metastatic setting) are of special concern in a setting where most patients are treated without adjuvant immunotherapy with a curative intention. After reassessment, these were myocarditis, interstitial lung disease (ILD), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=1 each). In conclusion, all of the related AEs with fatal outcome were single event occurrences and therefore no trends in terms of a safety signal were noted.  This has been reflected in the SmPC.

Laboratory findings : the laboratory test shifts to NCI-CTCAE Grade 3-4 Post-Baseline and those were low. The most frequent was high potassium (3.5%), high SGPT/ALT (3.3%), low sodium (2.7%), high glucose (2.7%) and high SGOT/AST (2.4%) in the Atezo arm. This was generally lower in the BSC arm (2.7% -0.2%) which was as expected.

The incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of atezolizumab was 18.2% (including 10.5% of AESI leading to discontinuation) and higher than the discontinuation rate in the metastatic setting (7.1%). The most frequent AEs were pneumonitis (1.4%), hypothyroidism (1.4%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (1.4%), hyperthyroidism (0.8%) and arthralgia (0.8%).  From the 18.2% of patients who discontinued atezolizumab due t o AEs, 0.8% were due to Grade 5 AEs, 8.7% were due to Grade 3 -4 AEs, and 8.7% were due to Grade 1 -2 AEs.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety data of atezolizumab in Study IMpower010 were generally consistent with the established safety profile of anti-PD/PD-L1 agents and no new ADRs were observed; however, higher rates of discontinuations due to AEs and higher incidences of imAEs were observed in Study IMpower010 compared with the pooled atezolizumab monotherapy safety data. Higher frequencies of uncommon, but clinically relevant imAEs are of concern in the adjuvant setting. The most common primary cause of death was disease relapse. The rate of 0.8% of treatment -related deaths due to AEs is highlighted in the SmPC.

The existing risk minimisation measures remains sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the new indication.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

No significant changes impacting the readability of the package leaflet are made. In particular, key safety messages are not affected by this variation. The additional text follows the same structure and use similar descriptions and terminology as used in the approved package leaflet.

The target group of users will be similar between the approved indication (metastatic NSCLC) and the applied indication (NSCLC following resection), with no significant age difference.

Moreover, the posology proposed in this application is the same as for the approved monotherapy indications for Tecentriq.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

The Applicant is seeking an extension of indication as follows:

'Early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated as adjuvant treatment following complete resection and platinumbased chemotherapy for adult patients with NSCLC with a high risk of recurrence whose tumours have PD-L1 expression on ≥ 50% of tumour cells (TC) and who do not have EGFR mutant or ALK positive NSCLC (see section 5.1 for selection criteria).'

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

With the development of cancer immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC, anti-PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors such as atezolizumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and durvalumab may improve the modest survival benefit of platinum-based chemotherapy alone in the adjuvant setting as they have when combined and/or sequentially administered with platinum-based chemotherapy in the recurrent or advanced settings.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There are currently no approved cancer immunotherapies for the adjuvant treatment of resectable, earlystage NSCLC, and it is agreed, that there is an unmet medical need for treatment options that improve the survival and reduces the relapse rates of these patients. Improvement of the adjuvant treatment after radical surgery is a relevant area of focus. The recent approval of osimertinib in early-stage EGFRmutated NSCLC (EMEA/H/C/004124/II/0039/G)  should be considered.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

The main clinical study GO29527 (IMpower010) is a Phase III, open-label, randomized study to investigate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 antibody) compared with best supportive care following adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with completely resected stage IB-IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

The submitted data are an interim analysis with a CCOD of May 2021, with ~32 months median FU.

The primary endpoint of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab monotherapy compared with BSC as measured by DFS as assessed by the investigator in:

- the PD-L1 ≥1% positive (defined as ≥ 1% TC by the SP263 IHC assay) NSCLC Stage II -IIIA subpopulation
- all randomized patients with Stage II-IIIA NSCLC, any degree of PD-L1 status
- the ITT population; Stage IB (tumour size ≥ 4 cm)-IIIA, any degree of PD-L1 status.

Overall survival was a secondary endpoint.

## 3.2. Favourable effects

The first two primary endpoints were met as DFS in the PD-L1 ≥ 1% stage II -IIIA subgroup and in the all randomised stage II-IIIA any PD-L1 status subgroup were statistically significant. Statistical significance for OS was however not reached, HR=0.77 (95%CI: 0.51 - 1.17).

In the completely resected stage II-IIIA (7 th  edition AJCC) NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression of ≥50% and without EGFR or ALK mutations ( n=209; 106 in the atezo arm and 103 in the BSC arm), the stratified HR for DFS was 0.49 (0.290.81), with 24 (22.6%) events in the atezolizumab arm and 45 (43.7%) events in the BSC arm. Median DFS was not established (NE) ( 95% CI: NE-NE) in the atezolizumab arm and 37.3 ( 95% CI: 30.1-NE)  months in the BSC arm. The stratified HR for OS was 0.39 (0.180.82) with 10 (9.5%) events in the atezolizumab arm and 24 (23%) events in the BSC arm. The median OS was NE in both arms.

The efficacy data support a favourable benefit risk balance for the PD-L1 high expression subgroup. This is based on the large effect size of the treatment effect of DFS and further supported by OS data.

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

The sample size constituting the indication group (n=209; 106 and 103 in each arm) is relatively small considering the magnitude of the investigated patient group (n=1005).

The data are immature regarding DFS. This hampers the interpretation of data and the clinical meaningfulness of the effects. The MAH is recommended to submit the final DFS analysis from Study GO29527.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, OS data are considered immature to draw reliable conclusions (event rates 9.5 % and 23% in the atezolizumab and BSC arms, respectively), especially regarding the effect sizes in subgroups. The MAH is recommended to provide interim and final analysis of OS as soon as available.

Patients with stage IB (7th edition AJCC), PDL1 expression of &lt;50% or ALK and EGFR driver mutations showed in the subgroup analyses non or detrimental effect of adjuvant atezolizumab. Additionally, a proven effective adjuvant treatment with osimertinib for the EGFR mutated patients is available. These patients groups were excluded from the indication.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

- Nearly all patients in the atezolizumab arm (92.7%) had at least one AE compared to 70.7% in the BSC arm. In Atezo Mono 1 and 2 groups it was 95.9% and 96.0%, respectively. The most common AEs in Impower010 were cough (13.3%), pyrexia (13,1%), hypothyroidism (11.1%), aspartate aminotransferase increased/alanine aminotransferase increased (10.7% for both), arthralgia (10.5%) and anaemia (7.7%).
- The proportion of patients with Grade 34 AEs in the atezolizumab arm (21.8%) was higher than in the BSC arm (11.5%). The most common were (BSC arm vs. atezolizumab arm, respectively): pneumonia (0.6% vs. 1.4%), increased ALT (0.2% vs. 1.6%), increased AST (0% vs. 1.4%), rash (0% vs. 1%) and hypertension (0.4% vs. 1%).
- The proportion of patients with at least one SAE was 17.6% in the Atezo arm compared with 8.5% in the BSC arm vs. 41.2% in the pooled atezolizumab monotherapy population. The most common type of SAE were infections.
- The incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment atezolizumab was 18.2% (including 10.5% of AESI leading to discontinuation) and higher than the discontinuation rate in the metastatic setting (7.1%).
- The proportion of deat hs were well balanced between the 2 arms (19.2% in the Atezo arm vs. 18.2% in the BSC arm) and was mostly due to disease relapse and AEs.  4 patients (0.8%) treated with atezolizumab presented Grade 5 AEs (compared to 0.3% in the metastatic setting) .

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

Twice as many patients in the Atezo arm in Impower010 died compared to the BSC arm of 'other' causes. After reassessment these were myocarditis, interstitial lung disease (ILD), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=1 each). In conclusion, all of the related AEs with fatal outcome were single event occurrences and therefore no trends in terms of a safety signal were noted. However, the MAH has been asked to reflect this in the SmPC.  The AEs with fatal outcome have been reflected in the SmPC.

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The data presented in the interim analysis (CCOD January 2021) to assess the efficacy and safety of one year of adjuvant treatment with atezolizumab as monotherapy following radical resection and platinumbased adjuvant chemotherapy for adult patients with NSCLC with PD-L1 expression of ≥ 1% were immature and did not support overall benefit in the proposed target population of the initially formulated indication statement. Lack of benefit and a potential detrimental effect was observed in patients with stage IB disease (7 th  edition AJCC) and in patients with PDL1&lt;50%, which was of concern. It was thus agreed with the MAH to restrict the indication to the subgroup of patients who seemed to drive the DFS benefit, i.e., patients with the stage II-IIIA (7 th  edition AJCC) completely resected NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression (≥50%), with no EGFR and ALK mutations. Within this rather small subgroup of patients (n=209; 106 and 103 patients in each arm), the data showed a beneficial effect of adjuvant treatment with atezolizumab with regards to both DFS and OS, although data were immature. The MAH is recommended to submit final DFS data and updated and final OS data post-approval. Final DFS and 2 nd

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

IA of OS is due in August 2024. The approved indication reflects the study population, who derived benefit from adjuvant treatment in the IMpower010 study, as precisely as possible and the exact selected patient population has been described in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Regarding safety, the toxicity profile of atezolizumab is known and no new ADRs were observed

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

The benefit/risk is considered positive for the following indication: Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated as adjuvant treatment following complete resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with NSCLC with a high risk of recurrence whose tumours have PD-L1 expression on ≥ 50% of tumour cells (TC) and who do not have EGFR mutant or ALKpositive NSCLC (see section 5.1 for selection criteria).

The MAH has updated the SmPC with the safety profile regarding this adjuvant treatment and with the efficacy data for the patients encompassed by the final indication statement. The staging of the patients included in the indication is thoroughly described in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

## 3.7.3. Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

Not applicable.

## 3.8. Conclusions

The overall B/R of atezolizumab as an adjuvant treatment for patients with completely resected stage IIIIIA (7th edition AJCC) NSCLC and PD-L1 ≥ 50% positive tumours not harbouring EGFR or ALK mutations is considered positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

## C.I.6 (Extension of indication)

Extension of indication to include adjuvant treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients whose tumours have PD-L1 expression on ≥ 50% of tumour cells (TC) for Tecentriq as monotherap y based on the results from the pivotal phase III Study GO29527 (IMpower010); as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated.  Minor editorial changes have been made throughout the SmPC. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 21.2 of the RMP has also been submitted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Amendments to the marketing authorisation

In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk Management Plan are recommended.

## Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

## Risk management plan (RMP)

The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP.

In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted:

At the request of the European Medicines Agency;

Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

## 5. EPAR changes

The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 8 \" steps after the authorisation \" will be updated as follows:

## Scope

Please refer to the Recommendations section above.

## Summary

Please refer to Scientific Discussion 'EMEA/H/C/004143/II/0064'

## Attachments

1. SmPC, Package Leaflet (changes highlighted) as adopted by the CHMP on 22 April 2022.

## Reminders to the MAH

1. In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the Agency makes available a European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial marketing authorisation (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal product. In particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the assessment report of the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to the authorisation, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature.

Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential information, please provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of commercially confidential information (CCI) in 'track changes' and with detailed justification by 08 April 2022. The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on the EMA website at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/heads-medicines-agencies/europeanmedicines-agency-guidance-document-identification-commercially-confidential-information\\_en.pdf

In addition, should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains personal data, please provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of these data in 'track changes' and with detailed justification by 08 April 2022. We would like to remind you that, according to Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, 'GDPR') 'personal data' means any information, relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (the 'data subject'). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

It is important to clarify that pseudonymised data are also considered personal data. According to Article 4(5) of GDPR pseudonymisation means that personal data is processed in a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information (e.g. key-coded data).

Accordingly, the name and the patient identification number are two examples of personal data which may relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. The definitions also encompass for instance: office e-mail address or phone number of a company, data concerning health, e.g. information in medical records, clinical reports or case narratives which relates to an identifiable individual.'

2. The MAH is reminded to submit an eCTD closing sequence with the final documents provided by Eudralink during the procedure (including final PI translations, if applicable) within 15 days after the Commission Decision, if there will be one within 2 months from adoption of the CHMP Opinion, or prior to the next regulatory activity, whichever is first. If the Commission Decision will be adopted within 12 months from CHMP Opinion, the closing sequence should be submitted within 30 days after the Opinion. For additional guidance see chapter 4.1 of the Harmonised Technical Guidance for eCTD Submissions in the EU.
3. If the approved RMP is using Rev. 2 of the 'Guidance on the format of the RMP in the EU' and the RMP 'Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan' has been updated in the procedure, the MAH is reminded to provide to the EMA Procedure Assistant by Eudralink a PDF version of the 'Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan' as a standalone document, within 14 calendar days of the receipt of the CHMP Opinion. The PDF should contain only text and tables and be free of metadata, headers and footers.
