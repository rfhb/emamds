edicinal product no longer authorise ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

AVAGLIM 4 mg/4 mg film-coated tablets.

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

edicinal product no longer authorise Each tablet contains rosiglitazone maleate corresponding to 4 mg rosiglitazone and 4 mg glimepiride. Excipient -contains lactose (approximately 104 mg) For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Film-coated tablet. Pink, rounded triangular tablet with 'gsk' debossed on one side and '4/4' on the other side. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications AVAGLIM is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients who are unable to achieve sufficient glycaemic control on optimal dosage of sulphonylurea monotherapy, and for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindication or intolerance. 4.2 Posology and method of administration AVAGLIM therapy should be individualised for each patient. Before therapy is initiated with AVAGLIM appropriate clinical evaluation should be made to assess the patient's risk of developing hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). AVAGLIM should be taken once daily shortly before or during a meal (usually the first main meal of the day). If a dose is forgotten, the following dose must not be increased. For patients inadequately controlled on glimepiride monotherapy (typically 4 mg) . Concomitant administration should be considered before the patient is switched to AVAGLIM. Where clinically appropriate, direct change from glimepiride monotherapy to AVAGLIM may be considered . The starting dose is 4 mg/day rosiglitazone plus 4 mg/day glimepiride (given as one tablet AVAGLIM 4 mg/4 mg). Patients unable to achieve glycaemic control on at least half-maximum dose of other sulphonylurea monotherapy (except chlorpropamide, see section 4.4). Rosiglitazone 4 mg should be administered concomitantly with the dose of sulphonylurea already being taken. Once glycaemic control is stable at these doses, AVAGLIM may be introduced at a starting dose of 4 mg rosiglitazone/4 mg glimepiride once daily.

AVAGLIM may be used to substitute concomitant sulphonylurea and rosiglitazone in established dual oral therapy providing the patient has achieved at least half-maximum dose of sulphonylurea.

The dose of the rosiglitazone component can be increased after 8 weeks if required. The maximum recommended daily dose is 8 mg rosiglitazone/4 mg glimepiride (given as one AVAGLIM tablet 8 mg/4 mg, once daily). An increase in the rosiglitazone component to 8 mg/day should be undertaken

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cautiously following appropriate clinical evaluation to assess the patient's risk of developing adverse reactions relating to fluid retention (see 4.4 and 4.8).

If hypoglycaemic symptoms occur, the patient should revert to concomitant therapy and adjust the glimepiride dose as appropriate.

edicinal product no longer authorise Elderly Due to the potential for decreased renal function the initiation and maintenance of therapy with AVAGLIM in elderly patients should be under close medical supervision due to an increased susceptibility to hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). Patients with renal impairment Mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 80 ml/min): -Patients changing to AVAGLIM from sulphonylurea therapies other than glimepiride may be at an increased risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). Appropriate monitoring is advised. AVAGLIM is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min, see section 4.3). Patients with hepatic impairment AVAGLIM is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). Children and adolescents AVAGLIM is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age as there are no data available on its safety and efficacy. 4.3 Contraindications Use of AVAGLIM is contraindicated in patients with: -hypersensitivity to rosiglitazone, glimepiride, other sulphonylureas or sulphonamides or to any of the excipients -cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (NYHA class I to IV) -an Acute Coronary Syndrome (unstable angina, NSTEMI and STEMI) (see section 4.4) -hepatic impairment -severe renal impairment i.e. creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min (including renal dialysis). -insulin dependant diabetes -diabetic ketoacidosis or diabetic coma. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use AVAGLIM is not indicated for combination use with metformin and therefore should not be used in triple oral therapy of diabetes. The following statements refer to AVAGLIM or the two individual active substances (rosiglitazone and glimepiride). Hypoglycaemia

Patients receiving AVAGLIM may be at risk of dose-related hypoglycaemia (see section 4.8). It is advised that patients established on rosiglitazone and chlorpropamide concomitant therapy should not switch to AVAGLIM as chlorpropamide has a long half-life which may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. If risk factors for hypoglycaemia are present (including renal insufficiency, low body weight, malnourishment, co-administration with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5) or if the patient's life-style changes) it may be necessary to revert to concomitant therapy and down titrate the glimepiride dose. A switch to insulin should be considered in stress situations (e.g. trauma, surgery, infections).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fluid retention and cardiac failure

Thiazolidinediones can cause fluid retention which may exacerbate or precipitate signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure. Rosiglitazone can cause dose-dependent fluid retention. The possible contribution of fluid retention to weight gain should be individually assessed as rapid and excessive weight gain has been reported very rarely as a sign of fluid retention. All patients, particularly those receiving concurrent insulin therapy, those at risk for heart failure and those with reduced cardiac reserve, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions relating to fluid retention, including weight gain and heart failure. Rosiglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs.

edicinal product no longer authorise Heart failure was also reported more frequently in patients with a history of heart failure; oedema and heart failure was also reported more frequently in elderly patients and in patients with mild or moderate renal failure. Caution should be exercised in patients over 75 years because of the limited experience in this patient group. Since NSAIDs and rosiglitazone are associated with fluid retention, concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema. Combination with insulin An increased incidence of cardiac failure has been observed in clinical trials when rosiglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Insulin and rosiglitazone are both associated with fluid retention, concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema and could increase the risk of ischaemic heart disease. Insulin should only be added to established rosiglitazone therapy in exceptional cases and under close supervision. Myocardial Ischaemia A retrospective analysis of data from 42 pooled short-term clinical studies indicated that treatment with rosiglitazone may be associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischaemic events. However, in their entirety the available data on the risk of cardiac ischaemia are inconclusive (see section 4.8). There are limited clinical trial data in patients with ischaemic heart disease and/or peripheral arterial disease. Therefore, as a precaution, the use of rosiglitazone is not recommended in these patients, particularly those with myocardial ischaemic symptoms. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) Patients experiencing an ACS have not been studied in rosiglitazone controlled clinical trials. In view of the potential for development of heart failure in these patients, rosiglitazone should therefore not be initiated in patients having an acute coronary event and it should be discontinued during the acute phase (see section 4.3). Monitoring of liver function There have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience with rosiglitazone (see section 4.8). There is limited experience with rosiglitazone in patients with elevated liver enzymes (ALT &gt;2.5X upper limit of normal). Therefore, liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with AVAGLIM in all patients and periodically thereafter based on clinical judgement. Therapy with AVAGLIM should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels (ALT &gt;2.5X upper limit of normal) or with any other evidence of liver disease. If ALT levels are increased to &gt;3X upper limit of normal during rosiglitazone therapy, liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible. If ALT levels remain &gt;3X the upper limit of normal, therapy should be discontinued. If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked. The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with AVAGLIM should be guided by clinical judgement pending laboratory evaluations. If jaundice is observed, drug therapy should be discontinued.

## Eye disorders

Post-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual acuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including rosiglitazone. Many of these patients reported concurrent peripheral oedema. It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association between rosiglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

oedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity and appropriate ophthalmologic referral should be considered.

## Patients with renal impairment

Patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 80 ml/min) may be at an increased risk of hypoglycaemia (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4). Appropriate monitoring is advised.

edicinal product no longer authorise Premenopausal anovulatory women Premenopausal women have received rosiglitazone during clinical studies. Although hormonal imbalance has been seen in preclinical studies (see section 5.3), no significant undesirable effects associated with menstrual disorders have been observed. As a consequence of improving insulin sensitivity, resumption of ovulation may occur in patients who are anovulatory due to insulin resistance. Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy (see section 4.6). Weight gain In clinical trials with rosiglitazone there was evidence of dose-related weight gain, which was greater when used in combination with insulin. Therefore weight should be closely monitored, given that it may be attributable to fluid retention, which may be associated with cardiac failure. Haematological monitoring Rosiglitazone treatment is associated with a dose-related reduction of haemoglobin levels. In patients with low haemoglobin levels before initiating therapy, there is an increased risk of anaemia during treatment with AVAGLIM. Periodic haematological monitoring (especially leucocytes and thrombocytes) are required during treatment with AVAGLIM. Treatment of patients with G6PD-deficiency with sulphonylurea agents can lead to haemolytic anaemia. Since glimepiride belongs to the chemical class of sulphonylurea drugs, caution should be used in patients with G6PD-deficiency and a non-sulphonylurea alternative should be considered. Bone disorders Long-term studies show an increased incidence of bone fractures in patients, particularly female patients, taking rosiglitazone (see section 4.8). The majority of the fractures have occurred in the upper limbs and distal lower limbs. In females, this increased incidence was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during long-term treatment. The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with rosiglitazone. Administration with other medicinal products Rosiglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin). Glimepiride should be used with caution during concomitant administration of CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole) or inducers (see section 4.5). Glycaemic control should be monitored closely. AVAGLIM dose adjustment within the recommended posology or changes in diabetic treatment should be considered. Lactose intolerance AVAGLIM tablets contain lactose and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

There have been no formal interaction studies for AVAGLIM. However, the concomitant use of the active substances in patients in clinical studies and in widespread clinical use has not resulted in any unexpected interactions. The following statements reflect the information available on the individual active substances (rosiglitazone and glimepiride).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rosiglitazone

In vitro studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8, with CYP2C9 as only a minor pathway.

Clinically significant interactions with CYP2C9 substrates or inhibitors are not anticipated.

edicinal product no longer authorise Co-administration of rosiglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of CYP2C8) resulted in a twofold increase in rosiglitazone plasma concentrations. Since there is a potential for an increase in the risk of dose-related adverse reactions, a decrease in rosiglitazone dose may be needed. Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered (see section 4.4). Co-administration of rosiglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer of CYP2C8) resulted in a 66% decrease in rosiglitazone plasma concentrations. It cannot be excluded that other inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St John's wort) may also affect rosiglitazone exposure. The rosiglitazone dose may need to be increased. Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered (see section 4.4). Concomitant administration of rosiglitazone with the oral anti-diabetic agents metformin, glimepiride, glibenclamide and acarbose did not result in any clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions. No clinically relevant interactions with digoxin, the CYP2C9 substrate warfarin, the CYP3A4 substrates nifedipine, ethinylestradiol or norethindrone were observed after co-administration with rosiglitazone. Glimepiride If glimepiride is taken simultaneously with certain other medicines, both undesired increases and decreases in the hypoglycaemic action of glimepiride can occur. For this reason, other medicines should only be taken with the knowledge (or at the prescription) of the doctor. Glimepiride is metabolized by cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9). Its metabolism is known to be influenced by concomitant administration of CYP2C9 inducers (e.g. rifampicin) or inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole Results from an vivo interaction study reported in literature show that glimepiride AUC is increased approximately 2-fold by fluconazole, one of the most potent CYP2C9 inhibitors. Based on the experience with glimepiride and with other sulphonylureas the following interactions have to be mentioned. Potentiation of the blood-glucose-lowering effect and, thus, in some instances hypoglycaemia may occur when one of the following drugs is taken, for example: phenylbutazone, azapropazon and oxyfenbutazone, sulphinpyrazone, insulin and oral antidiabetic products, certain long acting sulphonamides, metformin, tetracyclines, salicylates and p-amino-salicylic acid, MAO-inhibitors, anabolic steroids and male sex hormones, quinolone antibiotics, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarin anticoagulants, miconazol, fenfluramine, pentoxifylline (high dose parenteral), fibrates, tritoqualine, ACE inhibitors, fluconazole. fluoxetine, allopurinol, sympatholytics, cyclo-, tro-and iphosphamides,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Weakening of the blood-glucose-lowering effect and, thus raised blood glucose levels may occur when one of the following drugs is taken, for example:

<!-- image -->

edicinal product no longer authorise oestrogens and progestagens, saluretics, thiazide diuretics, thyroid stimulating agents, glucocorticoids, phenothiazine derivatives, chlorpromazine, adrenaline and sympathicomimetics, nicotinic acid (high dosages) and nicotinic acid derivatives, laxatives (long term use), phenytoin, diazoxide, glucagon, barbiturates and rifampicin, acetozolamide. H2 antagonists, betablockers, clonidine and reserpine may lead to either potentiation or weakening of the blood glucose lowering effect. Under the influence of sympatholytic drugs such as betablockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counterregulation to hypoglycaemia may be reduced or absent. Alcohol intake may potentiate or weaken the hypoglycaemic action of glimepiride in an unpredictable fashion. Glimepiride may either potentiate or weaken the effects of coumarin derivatives. 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation For AVAGLIM no preclinical or clinical data on exposed pregnancies or lactation are available. Rosiglitazone has been reported to cross the human placenta and to be detectable in foetal tissues. There are no adequate data from the use of either active substance (rosiglitazone and glimepiride) in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Therefore, AVAGLIM should not be used during pregnancy and the use of insulin is recommended. If a patient wishes to become pregnant or if pregnancy occurs, treatment with AVAGLIM should be discontinued. Both rosiglitazone and glimepiride have been detected in the milk of experimental animals. It is not known whether breast-feeding will lead to exposure of the infant to medicinal product. Therefore, AVAGLIM should not be used during lactation. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Nevertheless, the potential for hypoglycaemia should be borne in mind when considering the patient's ability to perform tasks that require judgement, motor or cognitive skills (e.g. driving). 4.8 Undesirable effects

Adverse reactions are presented below for each of the component parts of AVAGLIM. An adverse reaction is only presented for the fixed dose combination if it has not been seen in one of the component parts of AVAGLIM or if it occurred at a higher frequency than that listed for a component part.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## AVAGLIM

Data from double-blind studies confirm that the safety profile of concomitant rosiglitazone and glimepiride is similar to that of the combined adverse reaction profile for the two active substances. Limited data with AVAGLIM is also consistent with this combined adverse reaction profile.

## Rosiglitazone

edicinal product no longer authorise Clinical trial data Adverse reactions for each treatment regimen are presented below by system organ class and absolute frequency. For dose-related adverse reactions the frequency category reflects the higher dose of rosiglitazone. Frequency categories do not account for other factors including varying study duration, pre-existing conditions and baseline patient characteristics. Adverse reaction frequency categories assigned based on clinical trial experience may not reflect the frequency of adverse events occurring during normal clinical practice. Frequencies are defined as: very common ≥ 1/10; common ≥ 1/100, &lt; 1/10; and uncommon ≥ 1/1000, &lt; 1/100. Table 1 lists adverse reactions identified from an overview of clinical trials involving over 5,000 rosiglitazone-treated patients. Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in the table by decreasing frequency for the rosiglitazone monotherapy treatment regimen. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Table 1.

*The frequency category for the background incidence of this event, as taken from placebo group data from clinical trials, is 'common'.

1 Hypercholesterolaemia was reported in up to 5.3% of patients treated with rosiglitazone (monotherapy or dual oral therapy). The elevated total cholesterol levels were associated with increase in both LDLc and HDLc, but the ratio of total cholesterol:HDLc was unchanged or improved in long term studies. Overall, these increases were generally mild to moderate and usually did not require discontinuation of treatment.

edicinal product no longer authorise 2 An increased incidence of heart failure has been observed when rosiglitazone was added to treatment regimens with a sulphonylurea (either as dual or triple therapy), and appeared higher with 8 mg rosiglitazone compared to 4 mg rosiglitazone (total daily dose). The incidence of heart failure in combination with insulin (rosiglitazone added to established insulin therapy) was 2.4%, compared to insulin alone, 1.1%. Moreover in patients with congestive heart failure NYHA class I-II, a placebocontrolled one-year trial demonstrated worsening or possible worsening of heart failure in 6.4% of patients treated with rosiglitazone, compared with 3.5% on placebo. 3 In a retrospective analysis of data from 42 pooled short-term clinical studies, the overall incidence of events typically associated with cardiac ischaemia was higher for rosiglitazone containing regimens, 2.00% versus combined active and placebo comparators, 1.53% [hazard ratio (HR) 1.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.004 - 1.69)]. This risk was increased when rosiglitazone was added to established insulin and in patients receiving nitrates for known ischaemic heart disease. In an update to this retrospective analysis that included 10 further studies that met the criteria for inclusion, but were not available at the time of the original analysis, the overall incidence of events typically associated with cardiac ischaemia was not statistically different for rosiglitazone containing regimens, 2.21% versus combined active and placebo comparators, 2.08% [HR 1.098 (95% CI 0.809 - 1.354)]. In a prospective cardiovascular outcomes study (mean follow-up 5.5 years) the primary endpoint events of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation were similar between rosiglitazone and active comparators [HR 0.99 (95% CI 0.85 - 1.16)]. Two other long-term prospective randomised controlled clinical trials (9,620 patients, study duration &gt;3 years in each study), comparing rosiglitazone to some other approved oral antidiabetic agents or placebo, have not confirmed or excluded the potential risk of cardiac ischaemia. In their entirety, the available data on the risk of cardiac ischaemia are inconclusive. 4 Long-term studies show an increased incidence of bone fracture in patients, particularly female patients, taking rosiglitazone. In a monotherapy study, the incidence in females for rosiglitazone was 9.3% (2.7 patients per 100 patient years) vs 5.1% (1.5 patients per 100 patient years) for metformin or 3.5% (1.3 patients per 100 patient years) for glibenclamide. In another long-term study, there was an increased incidence of bone fracture for subjects in the combined rosiglitazone group compared to active control [8.3% vs 5.3%, Risk ratio 1.57 (95% CI 1.26 - 1.97)]. The risk of fracture appeared to be higher in females relative to control [11.5% vs 6.3%, Risk ratio 1.82 (95% CI 1.37 - 2.41)], than in males relative to control [5.3% vs 4.3%, Risk ratio 1.23 (95% CI 0.85 - 1.77)]. Additional data are necessary to determine whether there is an increased risk of fracture in males after a longer period of follow-up. The majority of the fractures were reported in the upper limbs and distal lower limbs (see section 4.4). In double-blind clinical trials with rosiglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo (0.2%) and less than that of the active comparators (0.5% metformin/sulphonylureas). The incidence of all adverse events relating to liver and biliary systems was &lt; 1.5% in any treatment group and similar to placebo.

## Post-marketing data

In addition to the adverse reactions identified from clinical trial data, the adverse reactions presented in Table 2 have been identified in post approval use of rosiglitazone. Frequencies are defined as: rare ≥ 1/10,000, &lt;1/1000 and very rare &lt;1/10,000 including isolated reports.

Rarely hypoglycaemic reactions can occur immediately and may be severe and not always easy to correct. 9 Elevation of liver enzymes may occur. 10 Hepatitis  may progress to liver failure. 11 Hypersensitivity reactions of the skin may occur as itching, rash and urticaria. Transient visual disturbances may occur especially on initiation of treatment, due to changes in blood glucose levels. 4.9 Overdose No data are available with regard to overdose of AVAGLIM. Limited data are available with regard to overdose of rosiglitazone in humans. In clinical studies in volunteers rosiglitazone has been administered at single oral doses of up to 20 mg and was well tolerated. Overdose of sulphonylureas, including glimepiride, can result in severe life-threatening hypoglycaemia lasting 12 to 72 hours, which may recur after apparent recovery. The symptoms may be delayed for up to 24 hours after ingestion. Hospitalisation should be considered as appropriate. In the event of an overdose, it is recommended that appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated as dictated by the patient's clinical status. Rosiglitazone and glimepiride are both highly protein bound and would not be expected to be cleared by haemodialysis.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Combinations of oral blood glucose lowering drugs, ATC code: A10BD04.

edicinal product no longer authorise AVAGLIM combines two antidiabetic agents with complimentary mechanisms of action to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: rosiglitazone maleate, a member of the thiazolidinedione class and glimepiride, a member of the sulphonylurea class. Thiazolidinediones act primarily by reducing insulin resistance and sulphonylureas act primarily by stimulating release of insulin from functioning pancreatic β -cells. A study comparing AVAGLIM to monotherapy rosiglitazone or glimepiride demonstrated incremental benefit in control of glycaemia of the fixed-dose combination over monotherapy.  No new safety findings were observed. The clinical trial program in support of this fixed dose combination only compared rosiglitazone and glimepiride to glimepiride monotherapy and not to monotherapy with other sulphonylureas. Rosiglitazone Rosiglitazone is a selective agonist at the PPAR γ (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) nuclear receptor and is a member of the thiazolidinedione class of antihyperglycaemic agents. It reduces glycaemia by reducing insulin resistance at adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. The antihyperglycaemic activity of rosiglitazone has been demonstrated in a number of animal models of type 2 diabetes. In addition, rosiglitazone preserved ß-cell function as shown by increased pancreatic islet mass and insulin content and prevented the development of overt hyperglycaemia in animal models of type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone did not stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion or induce hypoglycaemia in rats and mice. The major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) with high affinity to the soluble human PPAR γ , exhibited relatively high potency in a glucose tolerance assay in obese mice. The clinical relevance of this observation has not been fully elucidated. In clinical trials, the glucose lowering effects observed with rosiglitazone are gradual in onset with near maximal reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) evident following approximately 8 weeks of therapy. The improved glycaemic control is associated with reductions in both fasting and postprandial glucose. Rosiglitazone was associated with increases in weight. In mechanistic studies, the weight increase was predominantly shown to be due to increased subcutaneous fat with decreased visceral and intra-hepatic fat. Consistent with the mechanism of action, rosiglitazone reduced insulin resistance and improved pancreatic ß-cell function. Improved glycaemic control was also associated with significant decreases in free fatty acids. As a consequence of different but complementary mechanisms of action, dual oral therapy of rosiglitazone with a sulphonylurea or metformin resulted in additive effects on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients. In studies with a maximal duration of three years, rosiglitazone given once or twice daily produced a sustained improvement in glycaemic control (FPG and HbA1c). A more pronounced glucose-lowering effect was observed in obese patients. An outcome study has not been completed with rosiglitazone, therefore the long-term benefits associated with improved glycaemic control have not been demonstrated.

ADOPT (A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial) was a multicentre, double-blind, controlled trial with a treatment duration of 4-6 years (median duration of 4 years), in which rosiglitazone at doses of 4 to 8 mg/day was compared to metformin (500 mg to 2000 mg/day) and glibenclamide (2.5 to 15 mg/day) in 4351 drug naive subjects recently diagnosed ( ≤ 3 years) with type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone treatment significantly reduced the risk of reaching monotherapy failure (FPG&gt;10.0 mmol/L) by 63% relative to glibenclamide (HR 0.37, CI 0.30-0.45) and by 32% relative to metformin (HR 0.68,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CI 0.55-0.85) during the course of the study (up to 72 months of treatment). This translates to a cumulative incidence of treatment failure of 10.3% for rosiglitazone, 14.8% for metformin and 23.3% for glibenclamide treated patients. Overall, 43%, 47% and 42% of subjects in the rosiglitazone, glibenclamide and metformin groups respectively withdrew due to reasons other than monotherapy failure. The impact of these findings on disease progression or on microvascular or macrovascular outcomes has not been determined (see section 4.8). In this study, the adverse events observed were consistent with the known adverse event profile for each of the treatments, including continuing weight gain with rosiglitazone. An additional observation of an increased incidence of bone fractures was seen in women with rosiglitazone (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

edicinal product no longer authorise The RECORD (Rosiglitazone Evaluated for Cardiac Outcomes and Regulation of glycaemia in Diabetes) trial was a large (4,447 subjects), open-label, prospective, controlled study (mean follow-up 5.5 years) in which patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin or sulphonylurea were randomised to add-on rosiglitazone or metformin or sulphonylurea. The mean duration of diabetes in these patients was approximately 7 years. The adjudicated primary endpoint was cardiovascular hospitalisation (which included hospitalisations for heart failure) or cardiovascular death. Mean doses at the end of randomised treatment are shown in the following table: Randomised Treatment Rosiglitazone (either SU or metformin) Sulphonylurea (background metformin) Glimepiride* Metformin (background sulphonylurea) *Similar relative effective doses (i.e approximately half maximal dose) for other sulphonylureas (glibenclamide and glicazide). † Patients who took designated treatment as randomised in combination with the correct background treatment and with evaluable data. No difference in the number of adjudicated primary endpoint events for rosiglitazone (321/2220) versus active control (323/2227) (HR 0.99, CI 0.85-1.16) was observed, meeting the pre-defined noninferiority criterion of 1.20 (non-inferiority p = 0.02). HR and CI for key secondary endpoints were: all-cause death (HR 0.86, CI 0.68-1.08), MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Events - cardiovascular death, acute myocardial infarction, stroke) (HR 0.93, CI 0.74-1.15), cardiovascular death (HR 0.84, CI 0.59-1.18), acute myocardial infarction (HR 1.14, CI 0.80-1.63) and stroke (HR 0.72, CI 0.49-1.06). In a sub-study at 18 months, add-on rosiglitazone dual therapy was non-inferior to the combination of sulphonylurea plus metformin for lowering HbA1c. In the final analysis at 5 years, an adjusted mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c of 0.14% for patients on rosiglitazone added to metformin versus an increase of 0.17% for patients taking sulphonylurea added to metformin was seen during treatment with randomised dual-combination therapy (p&lt;0.0001 for treatment difference). An adjusted mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.24% was seen for patients taking rosiglitazone added to sulphonylurea, versus a reduction in HbA1c of 0.10% for patients taking metformin added to sulphonylurea, (p=0.0083 for treatment difference). There was a significant increase in heart failure (fatal and nonfatal) (HR 2.10, CI 1.35-3.27) and bone fractures (Risk Ratio 1.57, CI 1.26-1.97) in rosiglitazonecontaining treatments compared to active control (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). A total of 564 patients withdrew from cardiovascular follow-up, which accounted for 12.3% of rosiglitazone patients and 13% of control patients; representing 7.2% of patient-years lost for cardiovascular events follow-up and 2.0% of patient-years lost for all cause mortality follow-up. Glimepiride Glimepiride is an orally active hypoglycaemic substance belonging to the sulphonylurea group. It may be used in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

Glimepiride acts mainly by stimulating the release of insulin from the beta cells of the pancreas. As with other sulphonylureas, this effect is based on an improvement in responsiveness of pancreatic beta cells to the physiological glucose stimulus. In addition, glimepiride seems to have pronounced extrapancreatic effects, also postulated for other sulphonylureas.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sulphonylureas regulate insulin secretion by closing the ATP-dependent potassium channels in the beta cell membrane. Closure of the potassium channels leads to depolarisation of the beta cell and results by opening of the calcium channels - to an increased influx of calcium into the cell. This leads to a release of insulin by exocytosis.

Glimepiride binds with a high exchange rate to a beta cell membrane protein which is associated with the ATP-sensitive potassium channel but which differs from the usual sulphonylurea binding site.

edicinal product no longer authorise Extrapancreatic effects include an improvement in insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissue and a reduction in hepatic uptake of insulin. Glimepiride very rapidly increases the number of active glucose transport molecules in the plasma membranes of muscle and fat cells, resulting in stimulation of glucose uptake. Glimepiride increases the activity of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, which may be associated with drug-induced lipogenesis and glycogenesis in isolated fat and muscle cells. Glimepiride inhibits the hepatic glucose production by increasing the intracellular concentration of fructose-2,6 bisphosphate, which in turn inhibits gluconeogenesis. The minimum effective oral dose is approximately 0.6 mg. The effect of glimepiride is dosedependent and reproducible. The physiological response to acute physical exercise, a reduction in insulin secretion, is maintained during treatment with glimepiride. There was no significant difference in the effect regardless of whether the drug was taken 30 minutes before or immediately before a meal. In diabetic patients, good metabolic control over 24 hours can be achieved with a single daily dose. Although the hydroxy metabolite of glimepiride caused a small but significant reduction in serum glucose, it accounts for only a minor part of the total drug effect. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties AVAGLIM Single oral doses of glimepiride in 14 healthy adult subjects had no clinically significant effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone. No clinically significant reductions in glimepiride AUC and Cmax were observed after repeat doses of rosiglitazone for eight days in healthy adult subjects. In a bioequivalence study under fasted conditions, the AUC and Cmax of rosiglitazone and the AUC of glimepiride following a single dose of a 4 mg/4 mg combination tablet were bioequivalent to concomitant administration of rosiglitazone 4 mg and glimepiride 4 mg. In the fed state, the rate and extent of absorption of the rosiglitazone-glimepiride 4 mg/4 mg combination were equivalent to concomitant administration of 4 mg rosiglitazone and 4 mg glimepiride. Administration of the 4 mg/4 mg combination with food led to an increase in glimepiride exposure compared to that observed on administration in the fasted state. Glimepiride AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax were increased by 30%, 19% and 55% respectively, on average. For rosiglitazone, Cmax values were decreased by approximately 32% with food. The AUC and Cmax of glimepiride increased in a dose-proportional manner following administration of rosiglitazone-glimepiride 4 mg/1 mg, 4 mg/2 mg, and 4 mg/4 mg. The following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual components of AVAGLIM.

## Rosiglitazone

## Absorption

Absolute bioavailability of rosiglitazone following both a 4 and an 8 mg oral dose is approximately 99%. Rosiglitazone plasma concentrations peak at around 1 h after dosing. Plasma concentrations are approximately dose proportional over the therapeutic dose range.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Administration of rosiglitazone with food resulted in no change in overall exposure (AUC), although a small decrease in Cmax (approximately 20-28%) and a delay in tmax (approximately 1.75 h) were observed compared to dosing in the fasted state. These small changes are not clinically significant and, therefore, it is not necessary to administer rosiglitazone at any particular time in relation to meals. The absorption of rosiglitazone is not affected by increases in gastric pH.

edicinal product no longer authorise Distribution The volume of distribution of rosiglitazone is approximately 14 l in healthy volunteers. Plasma protein binding of rosiglitazone is high (approximately 99.8%) and is not influenced by concentration or age. The protein binding of the major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) is very high (&gt; 99.99%). Metabolism Metabolism of rosiglitazone is extensive with no parent compound being excreted unchanged. The major routes of metabolism are N-demethylation and hydroxylation, followed by conjugation with sulphate and glucuronic acid. The contribution of the major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) to the overall antihyperglycaemic activity of rosiglitazone has not been fully elucidated in man and it cannot be ruled out that the metabolite may contribute to the activity. However, this raises no safety concern regarding target or special populations as hepatic impairment is contraindicated and the phase III clinical studies included a considerable number of elderly patients and patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. In vitro studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8, with a minor contribution by CYP2C9. Since there is no significant in vitro inhibition of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A or 4A with rosiglitazone, there is a low probability of significant metabolism-based interactions with substances metabolised by these P450 enzymes. Rosiglitazone showed moderate inhibition of CYP2C8 (IC50 18 µM) and low inhibition of CYP2C9 (IC50 50 µM) in vitro (see section 4.5). An in vivo interaction study with warfarin indicated that rosiglitazone does not interact with CYP2C9 substrates in vivo . Elimination Total plasma clearance of rosiglitazone is around 3 l/h and the terminal elimination half-life of rosiglitazone is approximately 3-4 h. There is no evidence for unexpected accumulation of rosiglitazone after once or twice daily dosing. The major route of excretion is the urine with approximately two-thirds of the dose being eliminated by this route, whereas faecal elimination accounts for approximately 25% of dose. No intact active substance is excreted in urine or faeces. The terminal half-life for radioactivity was about 130 h indicating that elimination of metabolites is very slow. Accumulation of the metabolites in plasma is expected upon repeated dosing, especially that of the major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) for which an 8-fold accumulation is anticipated. Glimepiride Absorption After oral administration, glimepiride is completely (100%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Studies with single oral doses in normal subjects and with multiple oral doses in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have shown significant absorption of glimepiride within 1 h after administration and Cmax at approximately 2.5 h. There is a linear relationship between dose and both Cmax and AUC. Distribution After intravenous dosing in normal subjects, the volume of distribution was 8.8 l (113 ml/kg), and the total body clearance was 47.8 ml/min. Protein binding was greater than 99.5%.

## Metabolism

Glimepiride is completely metabolised by oxidative biotransformation after either an intravenous or oral dose. The major metabolites are the cyclohexyl hydroxy methyl derivative (M1) and the carboxyl derivative (M2). CYP2C9 has been shown to be involved in the biotransformation of glimepiride to M1. M1 is further metabolised to M2 by one or several cytosolic enzymes. M1, but not M2, possesses

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

about 1/3 of the pharmacological activity as compared to its parent in an animal model. The clinical significance of the glucose-lowering effect of M1 is unclear.

## Elimination

The elimination half-life of glimepiride is approximately 5 to 8 h. When 14 C-glimepiride was given orally, approximately 60% of the total radioactivity was recovered in the urine in seven days and M1 (predominant) and M2 accounted for 80 to 90% of that recovered in the urine. Approximately 40% of the total radioactivity was recovered in faeces and M1 and M2 (predominant) accounted for about 70% of that recovered in faeces. No parent drug was recovered from urine or faeces. After intravenous dosing in patients, no significant biliary excretion of glimepiride or its M1 metabolite was observed.

edicinal product no longer authorise Special populations Gender: In the pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no marked differences in the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone or glimepiride between males and females. Elderly: In the pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis , age was not found to influence the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone or glimepiride to any significant extent . Hepatic impairment: Following rosiglitazone treatment in cirrhotic patients with moderate (ChildPugh B) hepatic impairment, unbound Cmax and AUC were 2- and 3-fold higher than in normal subjects. The inter-subject variability was large, with a 7-fold difference in unbound AUC between patients. No adequate pharmacokinetic studies of glimepiride have been conducted in subjects with functional hepatic impairment. Therefore AVAGLIM should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.3) Renal insufficiency: There are no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone in patients with renal impairment or end stage renal disease on chronic dialysis. There are no data from the use of glimepiride in patients on renal dialysis (see section 4.3). A multiple-dose titration study with glimepiride conducted in 16 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with renal impairment using doses ranging from 1 to 8 mg daily for three months showed that all patients with a creatinine clearance less than 22 ml/min had adequate control of their glucose levels with a dosage regimen of only 1 mg daily (see section 4.2 and 4.4). 5.3 Preclinical safety data No animal studies have been conducted with the combined products in AVAGLIM. The following data are findings in studies performed with rosiglitazone or glimepiride individually. Rosiglitazone Undesirable effects observed in animal studies with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: An increase in plasma volume accompanied by decrease in red cell parameters and increase in heart weight. Increases in liver weight, plasma ALT (dog only) and fat tissue were also observed.  Similar effects have been seen with other thiazolidinediones. In reproductive toxicity studies, administration of rosiglitazone to rats during mid-late gestation was associated with foetal death and retarded foetal development. In addition, rosiglitazone inhibited ovarian oestradiol and progesterone synthesis and lowered plasma levels of these hormones resulting in effects on oestrus/menstrual cycles and fertility (see section 4.4).

In an animal model for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with rosiglitazone at 200 times the pharmacologically active dose increased tumour multiplicity in the colon. The relevance of this finding is unknown. However, rosiglitazone promoted differentiation and reversal of mutagenic changes in human colon cancer cells in vitro . In addition, rosiglitazone was not genotoxic in a battery of in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity studies and there was no evidence of colon tumours in lifetime studies of rosiglitazone in two rodent species.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Glimepiride

Preclinical effects were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use or were caused by the pharmacodynamic effect (hypoglycaemia) of the substance. This was based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and fertility. Studies on embryofoetal development and pre-and postnatal development revealed eye malformations, skeletal anomalies, abortions, and an increased foetal death rate.

edicinal product no longer authorise Reproduction toxicology findings may be related to the pharmacodynamic action of glimepiride. Glimepiride is excreted into the milk of lactating rats. High doses given to mother rats cause hypoglycaemia in suckling young rats (see section 4.6). 6.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

AVAGLIM 8 mg/4 mg film-coated tablets.

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

edicinal product no longer authorise Each tablet contains rosiglitazone maleate corresponding to 8 mg rosiglitazone and 4 mg glimepiride. Excipient -contains lactose (approximately 235 mg) For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Film-coated tablet. Red, biconvex, rounded triangular tablet with 'gsk' debossed on one side and '8/4' on the other side 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications AVAGLIM is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients who are unable to achieve sufficient glycaemic control on optimal dosage of sulphonylurea monotherapy, and for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindication or intolerance. 4.2 Posology and method of administration AVAGLIM therapy should be individualised for each patient. Before therapy is initiated with AVAGLIM appropriate clinical evaluation should be made to assess the patient's risk of developing hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). AVAGLIM should be taken once daily shortly before or during a meal (usually the first main meal of the day). If a dose is forgotten, the following dose must not be increased. For patients inadequately controlled on glimepiride monotherapy (typically 4 mg) . Concomitant administration should be considered before the patient is switched to AVAGLIM. Where clinically appropriate, direct change from glimepiride monotherapy to AVAGLIM may be considered . The starting dose is 4 mg/day rosiglitazone plus 4 mg/day glimepiride (given as one tablet AVAGLIM 4 mg/4 mg). Patients unable to achieve glycaemic control on at least half-maximum dose of other sulphonylurea monotherapy (except chlorpropamide, see section 4.4). Rosiglitazone 4 mg should be administered concomitantly with the dose of sulphonylurea already being taken. Once glycaemic control is stable at these doses, AVAGLIM may be introduced at a starting dose of 4 mg rosiglitazone/4 mg glimepiride once daily.

AVAGLIM may be used to substitute concomitant sulphonylurea and rosiglitazone in established dual oral therapy providing the patient has achieved at least half-maximum dose of sulphonylurea.

The dose of the rosiglitazone component can be increased after 8 weeks if required. The maximum recommended daily dose is 8 mg rosiglitazone/4 mg glimepiride (given as one AVAGLIM tablet 8 mg/4 mg, once daily). An increase in the rosiglitazone component to 8 mg/day should be undertaken

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cautiously following appropriate clinical evaluation to assess the patient's risk of developing adverse reactions relating to fluid retention (see 4.4 and 4.8).

If hypoglycaemic symptoms occur, the patient should revert to concomitant therapy and adjust the glimepiride dose as appropriate.

edicinal product no longer authorise Elderly Due to the potential for decreased renal function the initiation and maintenance of therapy with AVAGLIM in elderly patients should be under close medical supervision due to an increased susceptibility to hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). Patients with renal impairment Mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 80 ml/min): -Patients changing to AVAGLIM from sulphonylurea therapies other than glimepiride may be at an increased risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). Appropriate monitoring is advised. AVAGLIM is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min, see section 4.3). Patients with hepatic impairment AVAGLIM is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). Children and adolescents AVAGLIM is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age as there are no data available on its safety and efficacy. 4.3 Contraindications Use of AVAGLIM is contraindicated in patients with: -hypersensitivity to rosiglitazone, glimepiride, other sulphonylureas or sulphonamides or to any of the excipients -cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (NYHA class I to IV) -an Acute Coronary Syndrome (unstable angina, NSTEMI and STEMI) (see section 4.4) -hepatic impairment -severe renal impairment i.e. creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min (including renal dialysis). -insulin dependant diabetes -diabetic ketoacidosis or diabetic coma. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use AVAGLIM is not indicated for combination use with metformin and therefore should not be used in triple oral therapy of diabetes. The following statements refer to AVAGLIM or the two individual active substances (rosiglitazone and glimepiride). Hypoglycaemia

Patients receiving AVAGLIM may be at risk of dose-related hypoglycaemia (see section 4.8). It is advised that patients established on rosiglitazone and chlorpropamide concomitant therapy should not switch to AVAGLIM as chlorpropamide has a long half-life which may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. If risk factors for hypoglycaemia are present (including renal insufficiency, low body weight, malnourishment, co-administration with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5) or if the patient's life-style changes) it may be necessary to revert to concomitant therapy and down titrate the glimepiride dose. A switch to insulin should be considered in stress situations (e.g. trauma, surgery, infections).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fluid retention and cardiac failure

Thiazolidinediones can cause fluid retention which may exacerbate or precipitate signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure. Rosiglitazone can cause dose-dependent fluid retention. The possible contribution of fluid retention to weight gain should be individually assessed as rapid and excessive weight gain has been reported very rarely as a sign of fluid retention. All patients, particularly those receiving concurrent insulin therapy, those at risk for heart failure and those with reduced cardiac reserve, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions relating to fluid retention, including weight gain and heart failure. Rosiglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs.

edicinal product no longer authorise Heart failure was also reported more frequently in patients with a history of heart failure; oedema and heart failure was also reported more frequently in elderly patients and in patients with mild or moderate renal failure. Caution should be exercised in patients over 75 years because of the limited experience in this patient group. Since NSAIDs and rosiglitazone are associated with fluid retention, concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema. Combination with insulin An increased incidence of cardiac failure has been observed in clinical trials when rosiglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Insulin and rosiglitazone are both associated with fluid retention, concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema and could increase the risk of ischaemic heart disease. Insulin should only be added to established rosiglitazone therapy in exceptional cases and under close supervision. Myocardial Ischaemia A retrospective analysis of data from 42 pooled short-term clinical studies indicated that treatment with rosiglitazone may be associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischaemic events. However, in their entirety the available data on the risk of cardiac ischaemia are inconclusive (see section 4.8). There are limited clinical trial data in patients with ischaemic heart disease and/or peripheral arterial disease. Therefore, as a precaution, the use of rosiglitazone is not recommended in these patients, particularly those with myocardial ischaemic symptoms. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) Patients experiencing an ACS have not been studied in rosiglitazone controlled clinical trials. In view of the potential for development of heart failure in these patients, rosiglitazone should therefore not be initiated in patients having an acute coronary event and it should be discontinued during the acute phase (see section 4.3). Monitoring of liver function There have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience with rosiglitazone (see section 4.8). There is limited experience with rosiglitazone in patients with elevated liver enzymes (ALT &gt;2.5X upper limit of normal). Therefore, liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with AVAGLIM in all patients and periodically thereafter based on clinical judgement. Therapy with AVAGLIM should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels (ALT &gt;2.5X upper limit of normal) or with any other evidence of liver disease. If ALT levels are increased to &gt;3X upper limit of normal during rosiglitazone therapy, liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible. If ALT levels remain &gt;3X the upper limit of normal, therapy should be discontinued. If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked. The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with AVAGLIM should be guided by clinical judgement pending laboratory evaluations. If jaundice is observed, drug therapy should be discontinued.

## Eye disorders

Post-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual acuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including rosiglitazone. Many of these patients reported concurrent peripheral oedema. It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association between rosiglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

oedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity and appropriate ophthalmologic referral should be considered.

## Patients with renal impairment

Patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 80 ml/min) may be at an increased risk of hypoglycaemia (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4). Appropriate monitoring is advised.

edicinal product no longer authorise Premenopausal anovulatory women Premenopausal women have received rosiglitazone during clinical studies. Although hormonal imbalance has been seen in preclinical studies (see section 5.3), no significant undesirable effects associated with menstrual disorders have been observed. As a consequence of improving insulin sensitivity, resumption of ovulation may occur in patients who are anovulatory due to insulin resistance. Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy (see section 4.6). Weight gain In clinical trials with rosiglitazone there was evidence of dose-related weight gain, which was greater when used in combination with insulin. Therefore weight should be closely monitored, given that it may be attributable to fluid retention, which may be associated with cardiac failure. Haematological monitoring Rosiglitazone treatment is associated with a dose-related reduction of haemoglobin levels. In patients with low haemoglobin levels before initiating therapy, there is an increased risk of anaemia during treatment with AVAGLIM. Periodic haematological monitoring (especially leucocytes and thrombocytes) are required during treatment with AVAGLIM. Treatment of patients with G6PD-deficiency with sulphonylurea agents can lead to haemolytic anaemia. Since glimepiride belongs to the chemical class of sulphonylurea drugs, caution should be used in patients with G6PD-deficiency and a non-sulphonylurea alternative should be considered. Bone disorders Long-term studies show an increased incidence of bone fractures in patients, particularly female patients, taking rosiglitazone (see section 4.8). The majority of the fractures have occurred in the upper limbs and distal lower limbs. In females, this increased incidence was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during long-term treatment. The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with rosiglitazone. Administration with other medicinal products Rosiglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin). Glimepiride should be used with caution during concomitant administration of CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole) or inducers (see section 4.5). Glycaemic control should be monitored closely. AVAGLIM dose adjustment within the recommended posology or changes in diabetic treatment should be considered. Lactose intolerance AVAGLIM tablets contain lactose and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

There have been no formal interaction studies for AVAGLIM. However, the concomitant use of the active substances in patients in clinical studies and in widespread clinical use has not resulted in any unexpected interactions. The following statements reflect the information available on the individual active substances (rosiglitazone and glimepiride).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rosiglitazone

In vitro studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8, with CYP2C9 as only a minor pathway.

Clinically significant interactions with CYP2C9 substrates or inhibitors are not anticipated.

edicinal product no longer authorise Co-administration of rosiglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of CYP2C8) resulted in a twofold increase in rosiglitazone plasma concentrations. Since there is a potential for an increase in the risk of dose-related adverse reactions, a decrease in rosiglitazone dose may be needed. Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered (see section 4.4). Co-administration of rosiglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer of CYP2C8) resulted in a 66% decrease in rosiglitazone plasma concentrations. It cannot be excluded that other inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St John's wort) may also affect rosiglitazone exposure. The rosiglitazone dose may need to be increased. Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered (see section 4.4). Concomitant administration of rosiglitazone with the oral anti-diabetic agents metformin, glimepiride, glibenclamide and acarbose did not result in any clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions. No clinically relevant interactions with digoxin, the CYP2C9 substrate warfarin, the CYP3A4 substrates nifedipine, ethinylestradiol or norethindrone were observed after co-administration with rosiglitazone. Glimepiride If glimepiride is taken simultaneously with certain other medicines, both undesired increases and decreases in the hypoglycaemic action of glimepiride can occur. For this reason, other medicines should only be taken with the knowledge (or at the prescription) of the doctor. Glimepiride is metabolized by cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9). Its metabolism is known to be influenced by concomitant administration of CYP2C9 inducers (e.g. rifampicin) or inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole Results from an vivo interaction study reported in literature show that glimepiride AUC is increased approximately 2-fold by fluconazole, one of the most potent CYP2C9 inhibitors. Based on the experience with glimepiride and with other sulphonylureas the following interactions have to be mentioned. Potentiation of the blood-glucose-lowering effect and, thus, in some instances hypoglycaemia may occur when one of the following drugs is taken, for example: phenylbutazone, azapropazon and oxyfenbutazone, sulphinpyrazone, insulin and oral antidiabetic products, certain long acting sulphonamides, metformin, tetracyclines, salicylates and p-amino-salicylic acid, MAO-inhibitors, anabolic steroids and male sex hormones, quinolone antibiotics, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarin anticoagulants, miconazol, fenfluramine, pentoxifylline (high dose parenteral), fibrates, tritoqualine,

ACE inhibitors,

fluconazole.

fluoxetine,

allopurinol,

sympatholytics,

cyclo-, tro-and iphosphamides,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Weakening of the blood-glucose-lowering effect and, thus raised blood glucose levels may occur when one of the following drugs is taken, for example:

oestrogens and progestagens, saluretics, thiazide diuretics, thyroid stimulating agents, glucocorticoids, phenothiazine derivatives, chlorpromazine, adrenaline and sympathicomimetics, nicotinic acid (high dosages) and nicotinic acid derivatives, laxatives (long term use), phenytoin, diazoxide, glucagon, barbiturates and rifampicin, acetozolamide.

Adverse reactions are presented below for each of the component parts of AVAGLIM. An adverse reaction is only presented for the fixed dose combination if it has not been seen in one of the component parts of AVAGLIM or if it occurred at a higher frequency than that listed for a component part.

edicinal product no longer authorise H2 antagonists, betablockers, clonidine and reserpine may lead to either potentiation or weakening of the blood glucose lowering effect. Under the influence of sympatholytic drugs such as betablockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counterregulation to hypoglycaemia may be reduced or absent. Alcohol intake may potentiate or weaken the hypoglycaemic action of glimepiride in an unpredictable fashion. Glimepiride may either potentiate or weaken the effects of coumarin derivatives. 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation For AVAGLIM no preclinical or clinical data on exposed pregnancies or lactation are available. Rosiglitazone has been reported to cross the human placenta and to be detectable in foetal tissues. There are no adequate data from the use of either active substance (rosiglitazone and glimepiride) in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Therefore, AVAGLIM should not be used during pregnancy and the use of insulin is recommended. If a patient wishes to become pregnant or if pregnancy occurs, treatment with AVAGLIM should be discontinued. Both rosiglitazone and glimepiride have been detected in the milk of experimental animals. It is not known whether breast-feeding will lead to exposure of the infant to medicinal product. Therefore, AVAGLIM should not be used during lactation. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Nevertheless, the potential for hypoglycaemia should be borne in mind when considering the patient's ability to perform tasks that require judgement, motor or cognitive skills (e.g. driving). 4.8 Undesirable effects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## AVAGLIM

Data from double-blind studies confirm that the safety profile of concomitant rosiglitazone and glimepiride is similar to that of the combined adverse reaction profile for the two active substances. Limited data with AVAGLIM is also consistent with this combined adverse reaction profile.

## Rosiglitazone

edicinal product no longer authorise Clinical trial data Adverse reactions for each treatment regimen are presented below by system organ class and absolute frequency. For dose-related adverse reactions the frequency category reflects the higher dose of rosiglitazone. Frequency categories do not account for other factors including varying study duration, pre-existing conditions and baseline patient characteristics. Adverse reaction frequency categories assigned based on clinical trial experience may not reflect the frequency of adverse events occurring during normal clinical practice. Frequencies are defined as: very common ≥ 1/10; common ≥ 1/100, &lt; 1/10; and uncommon ≥ 1/1000, &lt; 1/100.

*The frequency category for the background incidence of this event, as taken from placebo group data from clinical trials, is 'common'.

1 Hypercholesterolaemia was reported in up to 5.3% of patients treated with rosiglitazone (monotherapy or dual oral therapy). The elevated total cholesterol levels were associated with increase in both LDLc and HDLc, but the ratio of total cholesterol:HDLc was unchanged or improved in long term studies. Overall, these increases were generally mild to moderate and usually did not require discontinuation of treatment.

edicinal product no longer authorise 2 An increased incidence of heart failure has been observed when rosiglitazone was added to treatment regimens with a sulphonylurea (either as dual or triple therapy), and appeared higher with 8 mg rosiglitazone compared to 4 mg rosiglitazone (total daily dose). The incidence of heart failure in combination with insulin (rosiglitazone added to established insulin therapy) was 2.4%, compared to insulin alone, 1.1%. Moreover in patients with congestive heart failure NYHA class I-II, a placebocontrolled one-year trial demonstrated worsening or possible worsening of heart failure in 6.4% of patients treated with rosiglitazone, compared with 3.5% on placebo. 3 In a retrospective analysis of data from 42 pooled short-term clinical studies, the overall incidence of events typically associated with cardiac ischaemia was higher for rosiglitazone containing regimens, 2.00% versus combined active and placebo comparators, 1.53% [hazard ratio (HR) 1.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.004 - 1.69)]. This risk was increased when rosiglitazone was added to established insulin and in patients receiving nitrates for known ischaemic heart disease. In an update to this retrospective analysis that included 10 further studies that met the criteria for inclusion, but were not available at the time of the original analysis, the overall incidence of events typically associated with cardiac ischaemia was not statistically different for rosiglitazone containing regimens, 2.21% versus combined active and placebo comparators, 2.08% [HR 1.098 (95% CI 0.809 - 1.354)]. In a prospective cardiovascular outcomes study (mean follow-up 5.5 years) the primary endpoint events of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation were similar between rosiglitazone and active comparators [HR 0.99 (95% CI 0.85 - 1.16)]. Two other long-term prospective randomised controlled clinical trials (9,620 patients, study duration &gt;3 years in each study), comparing rosiglitazone to some other approved oral antidiabetic agents or placebo, have not confirmed or excluded the potential risk of cardiac ischaemia. In their entirety, the available data on the risk of cardiac ischaemia are inconclusive. 4 Long-term studies show an increased incidence of bone fracture in patients, particularly female patients, taking rosiglitazone. In a monotherapy study, the incidence in females for rosiglitazone was 9.3% (2.7 patients per 100 patient years) vs 5.1% (1.5 patients per 100 patient years) for metformin or 3.5% (1.3 patients per 100 patient years) for glibenclamide. In another long-term study, there was an increased incidence of bone fracture for subjects in the combined rosiglitazone group compared to active control [8.3% vs 5.3%, Risk ratio 1.57 (95% CI 1.26 - 1.97)]. The risk of fracture appeared to be higher in females relative to control [11.5% vs 6.3%, Risk ratio 1.82 (95% CI 1.37 - 2.41)], than in males relative to control [5.3% vs 4.3%, Risk ratio 1.23 (95% CI 0.85 - 1.77)]. Additional data are necessary to determine whether there is an increased risk of fracture in males after a longer period of follow-up. The majority of the fractures were reported in the upper limbs and distal lower limbs (see section 4.4). In double-blind clinical trials with rosiglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo (0.2%) and less than that of the active comparators (0.5% metformin/sulphonylureas). The incidence of all adverse events relating to liver and biliary systems was &lt; 1.5% in any treatment group and similar to placebo.

## Post-marketing data

In addition to the adverse reactions identified from clinical trial data, the adverse reactions presented in Table 2 have been identified in post approval use of rosiglitazone. Frequencies are defined as: rare ≥ 1/10,000, &lt;1/1000 and very rare &lt;1/10,000 including isolated reports.

Limited data are available with regard to overdose of rosiglitazone in humans. In clinical studies in volunteers rosiglitazone has been administered at single oral doses of up to 20 mg and was well tolerated. Overdose of sulphonylureas, including glimepiride, can result in severe life-threatening hypoglycaemia lasting 12 to 72 hours, which may recur after apparent recovery. The symptoms may be delayed for up to 24 hours after ingestion. Hospitalisation should be considered as appropriate. In the event of an overdose, it is recommended that appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated as dictated by the patient's clinical status. Rosiglitazone and glimepiride are both highly protein bound and would not be expected to be cleared by haemodialysis.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Combinations of oral blood glucose lowering drugs, ATC code: A10BD04

edicinal product no longer authorise AVAGLIM combines two antidiabetic agents with complimentary mechanisms of action to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: rosiglitazone maleate, a member of the thiazolidinedione class and glimepiride, a member of the sulphonylurea class. Thiazolidinediones act primarily by reducing insulin resistance and sulphonylureas act primarily by stimulating release of insulin from functioning pancreatic β -cells. A study comparing AVAGLIM to monotherapy rosiglitazone or glimepiride demonstrated incremental benefit in control of glycaemia of the fixed-dose combination over monotherapy.  No new safety findings were observed. The clinical trial program in support of this fixed dose combination only compared rosiglitazone and glimepiride to glimepiride monotherapy and not to monotherapy with other sulphonylureas. Rosiglitazone Rosiglitazone is a selective agonist at the PPAR γ (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) nuclear receptor and is a member of the thiazolidinedione class of antihyperglycaemic agents. It reduces glycaemia by reducing insulin resistance at adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. The antihyperglycaemic activity of rosiglitazone has been demonstrated in a number of animal models of type 2 diabetes. In addition, rosiglitazone preserved ß-cell function as shown by increased pancreatic islet mass and insulin content and prevented the development of overt hyperglycaemia in animal models of type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone did not stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion or induce hypoglycaemia in rats and mice. The major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) with high affinity to the soluble human PPAR γ , exhibited relatively high potency in a glucose tolerance assay in obese mice. The clinical relevance of this observation has not been fully elucidated. In clinical trials, the glucose lowering effects observed with rosiglitazone are gradual in onset with near maximal reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) evident following approximately 8 weeks of therapy. The improved glycaemic control is associated with reductions in both fasting and postprandial glucose. Rosiglitazone was associated with increases in weight. In mechanistic studies, the weight increase was predominantly shown to be due to increased subcutaneous fat with decreased visceral and intra-hepatic fat. Consistent with the mechanism of action, rosiglitazone reduced insulin resistance and improved pancreatic ß-cell function. Improved glycaemic control was also associated with significant decreases in free fatty acids. As a consequence of different but complementary mechanisms of action, dual oral therapy of rosiglitazone with a sulphonylurea or metformin resulted in additive effects on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients. In studies with a maximal duration of three years, rosiglitazone given once or twice daily produced a sustained improvement in glycaemic control (FPG and HbA1c). A more pronounced glucose-lowering effect was observed in obese patients. An outcome study has not been completed with rosiglitazone, therefore the long-term benefits associated with improved glycaemic control have not been demonstrated.

ADOPT (A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial) was a multicentre, double-blind, controlled trial with a treatment duration of 4-6 years (median duration of 4 years), in which rosiglitazone at doses of 4 to 8 mg/day was compared to metformin (500 mg to 2000 mg/day) and glibenclamide (2.5 to 15 mg/day) in 4351 drug naive subjects recently diagnosed ( ≤ 3 years) with type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone treatment significantly reduced the risk of reaching monotherapy failure (FPG&gt;10.0 mmol/L) by 63% relative to glibenclamide (HR 0.37, CI 0.30-0.45) and by 32% relative to metformin (HR 0.68,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CI 0.55-0.85) during the course of the study (up to 72 months of treatment). This translates to a cumulative incidence of treatment failure of 10.3% for rosiglitazone, 14.8% for metformin and 23.3% for glibenclamide treated patients. Overall, 43%, 47% and 42% of subjects in the rosiglitazone, glibenclamide and metformin groups respectively withdrew due to reasons other than monotherapy failure. The impact of these findings on disease progression or on microvascular or macrovascular outcomes has not been determined (see section 4.8). In this study, the adverse events observed were consistent with the known adverse event profile for each of the treatments, including continuing weight gain with rosiglitazone. An additional observation of an increased incidence of bone fractures was seen in women with rosiglitazone (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

The mean duration of diabetes in these patients was approximately 7 years. The adjudicated primary endpoint was cardiovascular hospitalisation (which included hospitalisations for heart failure) or cardiovascular death.

No difference in the number of adjudicated primary endpoint events for rosiglitazone (321/2220) versus active control (323/2227) (HR 0.99, CI 0.85-1.16) was observed, meeting the pre-defined noninferiority criterion of 1.20 (non-inferiority p = 0.02). HR and CI for key secondary endpoints were: all-cause death (HR 0.86, CI 0.68-1.08), MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Events - cardiovascular death, acute myocardial infarction, stroke) (HR 0.93, CI 0.74-1.15), cardiovascular death (HR 0.84, CI 0.59-1.18), acute myocardial infarction (HR 1.14, CI 0.80-1.63) and stroke (HR 0.72, CI 0.49-1.06). In a sub-study at 18 months, add-on rosiglitazone dual therapy was non-inferior to the combination of sulphonylurea plus metformin for lowering HbA1c. In the final analysis at 5 years, an adjusted mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c of 0.14% for patients on rosiglitazone added to metformin versus an increase of 0.17% for patients taking sulphonylurea added to metformin was seen during treatment with randomised dual-combination therapy (p&lt;0.0001 for treatment difference). An adjusted mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.24% was seen for patients taking rosiglitazone added to sulphonylurea, versus a reduction in HbA1c of 0.10% for patients taking metformin added to sulphonylurea, (p=0.0083 for treatment difference). There was a significant increase in heart failure (fatal and nonfatal) (HR 2.10, CI 1.35-3.27) and bone fractures (Risk Ratio 1.57, CI 1.26-1.97) in rosiglitazonecontaining treatments compared to active control (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). A total of 564 patients withdrew from cardiovascular follow-up, which accounted for 12.3% of rosiglitazone patients and 13% of control patients; representing 7.2% of patient-years lost for cardiovascular events follow-up and 2.0% of patient-years lost for all cause mortality follow-up. Glimepiride Glimepiride is an orally active hypoglycaemic substance belonging to the sulphonylurea group. It may be used in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

Glimepiride acts mainly by stimulating the release of insulin from the beta cells of the pancreas. As with other sulphonylureas, this effect is based on an improvement in responsiveness of pancreatic beta cells to the physiological glucose stimulus. In addition, glimepiride seems to have pronounced extrapancreatic effects, also postulated for other sulphonylureas.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sulphonylureas regulate insulin secretion by closing the ATP-dependent potassium channels in the beta cell membrane. Closure of the potassium channels leads to depolarisation of the beta cell and results by opening of the calcium channels - to an increased influx of calcium into the cell. This leads to a release of insulin by exocytosis.

Glimepiride binds with a high exchange rate to a beta cell membrane protein which is associated with the ATP-sensitive potassium channel but which differs from the usual sulphonylurea binding site.

edicinal product no longer authorise Extrapancreatic effects include an improvement in insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissue and a reduction in hepatic uptake of insulin. Glimepiride very rapidly increases the number of active glucose transport molecules in the plasma membranes of muscle and fat cells, resulting in stimulation of glucose uptake. Glimepiride increases the activity of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, which may be associated with drug-induced lipogenesis and glycogenesis in isolated fat and muscle cells. Glimepiride inhibits the hepatic glucose production by increasing the intracellular concentration of fructose-2,6 bisphosphate, which in turn inhibits gluconeogenesis. The minimum effective oral dose is approximately 0.6 mg. The effect of glimepiride is dosedependent and reproducible. The physiological response to acute physical exercise, a reduction in insulin secretion, is maintained during treatment with glimepiride. There was no significant difference in the effect regardless of whether the drug was taken 30 minutes before or immediately before a meal. In diabetic patients, good metabolic control over 24 hours can be achieved with a single daily dose. Although the hydroxy metabolite of glimepiride caused a small but significant reduction in serum glucose, it accounts for only a minor part of the total drug effect. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties AVAGLIM Single oral doses of glimepiride in 14 healthy adult subjects had no clinically significant effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone. No clinically significant reductions in glimepiride AUC and Cmax were observed after repeat doses of rosiglitazone for eight days in healthy adult subjects. In a bioequivalence study under fasted conditions, the AUC and Cmax of rosiglitazone and the AUC of glimepiride following a single dose of a 4 mg/4 mg combination tablet were bioequivalent to concomitant administration of rosiglitazone 4 mg and glimepiride 4 mg. In the fed state, the rate and extent of absorption of the rosiglitazone-glimepiride 4 mg/4 mg combination were equivalent to concomitant administration of 4 mg rosiglitazone and 4 mg glimepiride. Administration of the 4 mg/4 mg combination with food led to an increase in glimepiride exposure compared to that observed on administration in the fasted state. Glimepiride AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax were increased by 30%, 19% and 55% respectively, on average. For rosiglitazone, Cmax values were decreased by approximately 32% with food. The AUC and Cmax of glimepiride increased in a dose-proportional manner following administration of rosiglitazone-glimepiride 4 mg/1 mg, 4 mg/2 mg, and 4 mg/4 mg. The following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual components of AVAGLIM.

## Rosiglitazone

## Absorption

Absolute bioavailability of rosiglitazone following both a 4 and an 8 mg oral dose is approximately 99%. Rosiglitazone plasma concentrations peak at around 1 h after dosing. Plasma concentrations are approximately dose proportional over the therapeutic dose range.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Administration of rosiglitazone with food resulted in no change in overall exposure (AUC), although a small decrease in Cmax (approximately 20-28%) and a delay in tmax (approximately 1.75 h) were observed compared to dosing in the fasted state. These small changes are not clinically significant and, therefore, it is not necessary to administer rosiglitazone at any particular time in relation to meals. The absorption of rosiglitazone is not affected by increases in gastric pH.

edicinal product no longer authorise Distribution The volume of distribution of rosiglitazone is approximately 14 l in healthy volunteers. Plasma protein binding of rosiglitazone is high (approximately 99.8%) and is not influenced by concentration or age. The protein binding of the major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) is very high (&gt; 99.99%). Metabolism Metabolism of rosiglitazone is extensive with no parent compound being excreted unchanged. The major routes of metabolism are N-demethylation and hydroxylation, followed by conjugation with sulphate and glucuronic acid. The contribution of the major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) to the overall antihyperglycaemic activity of rosiglitazone has not been fully elucidated in man and it cannot be ruled out that the metabolite may contribute to the activity. However, this raises no safety concern regarding target or special populations as hepatic impairment is contraindicated and the phase III clinical studies included a considerable number of elderly patients and patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. In vitro studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8, with a minor contribution by CYP2C9. Since there is no significant in vitro inhibition of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A or 4A with rosiglitazone, there is a low probability of significant metabolism-based interactions with substances metabolised by these P450 enzymes. Rosiglitazone showed moderate inhibition of CYP2C8 (IC50 18 µM) and low inhibition of CYP2C9 (IC50 50 µM) in vitro (see section 4.5). An in vivo interaction study with warfarin indicated that rosiglitazone does not interact with CYP2C9 substrates in vivo . Elimination Total plasma clearance of rosiglitazone is around 3 l/h and the terminal elimination half-life of rosiglitazone is approximately 3-4 h. There is no evidence for unexpected accumulation of rosiglitazone after once or twice daily dosing. The major route of excretion is the urine with approximately two-thirds of the dose being eliminated by this route, whereas faecal elimination accounts for approximately 25% of dose. No intact active substance is excreted in urine or faeces. The terminal half-life for radioactivity was about 130 h indicating that elimination of metabolites is very slow. Accumulation of the metabolites in plasma is expected upon repeated dosing, especially that of the major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) for which an 8-fold accumulation is anticipated. Glimepiride Absorption After oral administration, glimepiride is completely (100%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Studies with single oral doses in normal subjects and with multiple oral doses in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have shown significant absorption of glimepiride within 1 h after administration and Cmax at approximately 2.5 h. There is a linear relationship between dose and both Cmax and AUC. Distribution After intravenous dosing in normal subjects, the volume of distribution was 8.8 l (113 ml/kg), and the total body clearance was 47.8 ml/min. Protein binding was greater than 99.5%.

## Metabolism

Glimepiride is completely metabolised by oxidative biotransformation after either an intravenous or oral dose. The major metabolites are the cyclohexyl hydroxy methyl derivative (M1) and the carboxyl derivative (M2). CYP2C9 has been shown to be involved in the biotransformation of glimepiride to M1. M1 is further metabolised to M2 by one or several cytosolic enzymes. M1, but not M2, possesses

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

about 1/3 of the pharmacological activity as compared to its parent in an animal model. The clinical significance of the glucose-lowering effect of M1 is unclear.

## Elimination

The elimination half-life of glimepiride is approximately 5 to 8 h. When 14 C-glimepiride was given orally, approximately 60% of the total radioactivity was recovered in the urine in seven days and M1 (predominant) and M2 accounted for 80 to 90% of that recovered in the urine. Approximately 40% of the total radioactivity was recovered in faeces and M1 and M2 (predominant) accounted for about 70% of that recovered in faeces. No parent drug was recovered from urine or faeces. After intravenous dosing in patients, no significant biliary excretion of glimepiride or its M1 metabolite was observed.

edicinal product no longer authorise Special populations Gender: In the pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no marked differences in the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone or glimepiride between males and females. Elderly: In the pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis , age was not found to influence the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone or glimepiride to any significant extent . Hepatic impairment: Following rosiglitazone treatment in cirrhotic patients with moderate (ChildPugh B) hepatic impairment, unbound Cmax and AUC were 2- and 3-fold higher than in normal subjects. The inter-subject variability was large, with a 7-fold difference in unbound AUC between patients. No adequate pharmacokinetic studies of glimepiride have been conducted in subjects with functional hepatic impairment. Therefore AVAGLIM should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.3) Renal insufficiency: There are no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone in patients with renal impairment or end stage renal disease on chronic dialysis. There are no data from the use of glimepiride in patients on renal dialysis (see section 4.3). A multiple-dose titration study with glimepiride conducted in 16 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with renal impairment using doses ranging from 1 to 8 mg daily for three months showed that all patients with a creatinine clearance less than 22 ml/min had adequate control of their glucose levels with a dosage regimen of only 1 mg daily (see section 4.2 and 4.4). 5.3 Preclinical safety data No animal studies have been conducted with the combined products in AVAGLIM. The following data are findings in studies performed with rosiglitazone or glimepiride individually. Rosiglitazone Undesirable effects observed in animal studies with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: An increase in plasma volume accompanied by decrease in red cell parameters and increase in heart weight. Increases in liver weight, plasma ALT (dog only) and fat tissue were also observed.  Similar effects have been seen with other thiazolidinediones. In reproductive toxicity studies, administration of rosiglitazone to rats during mid-late gestation was associated with foetal death and retarded foetal development. In addition, rosiglitazone inhibited ovarian oestradiol and progesterone synthesis and lowered plasma levels of these hormones resulting in effects on oestrus/menstrual cycles and fertility (see section 4.4).

In an animal model for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with rosiglitazone at 200 times the pharmacologically active dose increased tumour multiplicity in the colon. The relevance of this finding is unknown. However, rosiglitazone promoted differentiation and reversal of mutagenic changes in human colon cancer cells in vitro . In addition, rosiglitazone was not genotoxic in a battery of in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity studies and there was no evidence of colon tumours in lifetime studies of rosiglitazone in two rodent species.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Glimepiride

Preclinical effects were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use or were caused by the pharmacodynamic effect (hypoglycaemia) of the substance. This was based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and fertility. Studies on embryofoetal development and pre-and postnatal development revealed eye malformations, skeletal anomalies, abortions, and an increased foetal death rate.

edicinal product no longer authorise Reproduction toxicology findings may be related to the pharmacodynamic action of glimepiride. Glimepiride is excreted into the milk of lactating rats. High doses given to mother rats cause hypoglycaemia in suckling young rats (see section 4.6). 6.

rosiglitazone/glimepiride edicinal product no longer authorise Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine. -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. -This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours. -If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, tell your doctor or pharmacist. In this leaflet : 1. What Avaglim is and what it is used for 2. Before you take Avaglim 3. How to take Avaglim 4. Possible side effects 5 How to store Avaglim 6. Further information 1. WHAT AVAGLIM IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR Avaglim tablets are a combination of two different medicines called rosiglitazone and glimepiride. These two medicines are used to treat type 2 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes either don't make enough insulin (a hormone that controls blood sugar levels), or don't respond normally to the insulin their body makes. Rosiglitazone and glimepiride work together so your body makes better use of the insulin it produces, and this helps reduce your blood sugar to a normal level. 2. BEFORE YOU TAKE AVAGLIM To help manage your diabetes, it is important that you follow any diet and lifestyle advice from your doctor as well as taking Avaglim. Don't take Avaglim: · if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to rosiglitazone, glimepiride, or any of the other ingredients of Avaglim ( listed in Section 6), or to other medicines called sulphonylureas (like glibenclamide ) or sulphonamides · if you have had a heart attack or severe angina, that's being treated in hospital · if you have heart failure, or have had heart failure in the past · if you have liver disease · if you have had diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes causing rapid weight loss, nausea or vomiting) · if you have severe kidney disease · if you have type 1 diabetes - this needs different treatment.

- Î Check with your doctor if you think any of these apply to you. Don't take Avaglim.

## Take special care with Avaglim

Avaglim is not recommended for people aged under 18 , as the safety and effectiveness are not known.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you have been diagnosed with angina (chest pain), or peripheral arterial disease (reduced blood flow to the legs):

- Î Check with your doctor, as Avaglim may not be suitable for you.

Haemolytic anaemia: If you have an inherited condition where your red blood cells don't produce enough of the enzyme G6PD, Avaglim may cause your red blood cells to be destroyed too quickly ( haemolytic anaemia ).

edicinal product no longer authorise Î Tell your doctor if you have this condition, as Avaglim may not be suitable for you. Conditions to look out for Avaglim and other medicines for diabetes can make some existing conditions worse, or cause serious side effects.  You must look out for certain symptoms while you are taking Avaglim, to reduce the risk of any problems. See ' Conditions you need to look out for' in Section 4. Ovulation may restart Women who are infertile due to a condition affecting their ovaries (such as Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome ), may start ovulating again when they start taking Avaglim. If this applies to you, use appropriate contraception to avoid the possibility of an unplanned pregnancy (see 'Pregnancy and breast-feeding' later in Section 2). You will have regular blood tests Avaglim can cause reductions in some types of blood cells. Your doctor should regularly test your blood while you are taking Avaglim. Your kidney function will be checked If you have kidney disease, or are over 65, your kidney function should be checked while you are taking Avaglim. Taking other medicines Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, if you've taken any recently, or if you start taking new ones. This includes herbal medicines and other medicines you bought without a prescription. Many medicines (or alcohol) can affect the way Avaglim controls the amount of sugar in your blood. Your blood sugar levels may become too high or too low ( see 'Low blood sugar' in Section 4 ). Some of the medicines most likely to do this are: · gemfibrozil (used to lower cholesterol ) · rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis and other infections) · fluconazole (used to treat fungal infections ). Î Tell a doctor or pharmacist if you think that Avaglim is not working as it should, particularly if you are taking any other medicines. You may need to have the dose adjusted or change the other medicines you are taking. Some medicines used to treat high blood pressure (such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine or reserpine) may make you less aware of the warning signs of low blood sugar (sweating; fast irregular heartbeats). Î Checking your blood sugar levels regularly is especially important if you are taking any of these medicines, even if you are feeling well

Avaglim can also strengthen or weaken the effects of medicines to prevent blood clots (anticoagulants such as warfarin).

- Î Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking anticoagulants .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

- Avaglim is not recommended during pregnancy. If you are pregnant or could be pregnant, tell your doctor.
- Don't breast-feed while you are taking Avaglim. The ingredients may pass into breast milk and so may harm your baby.

edicinal product no longer authorise Driving and using machines Avaglim can make you dizzy or cause your blood sugar to become lower than normal ( see 'Low blood sugar' in Section 4 ). Î Don't drive or operate machinery unless you're feeling well. Avaglim contains lactose Avaglim tablets contain a small amount of lactose. Patients who are intolerant to lactose or have a rare hereditary problem of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. 3. HOW TO TAKE AVAGLIM Always take Avaglim tablets exactly as your doctor has told you. Do not take more than the recommended dose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. How much to take The usual starting dose is one combined tablet (4 mg rosiglitazone and 4 mg glimepiride), taken once a day. After about 8 weeks your doctor may need to increase your dose. The maximum dose is one combined tablet of 8 mg rosiglitazone and 4 mg glimepiride, taken once a day. How to take Swallow the tablets with some water. It is best to take Avaglim with food, or just before food, usually with your first main meal of the day. Take your tablets around the same time every day and follow any dietary advice that your doctor has given you. If you take more Avaglim than you should If you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.
