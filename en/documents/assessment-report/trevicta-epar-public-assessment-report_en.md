## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

This  application  is  an  informed  consent  application  in  accordance  with  Article  l0(c)  of  Directive 2001/83/EC for Paliperidone Janssen 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 100+150 mg Prolonged release suspension for injection in order to obtain a Marketing Authorisation identical to Xeplion 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 100+150 mg Prolonged release suspension for injection (EU/1/11/672/001-006).

As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Paliperidone Janssen medicinal product are identical  to  the  up-to-date  quality,  non-clinical  and  clinical  profile  of  Xeplion.  The  application  for Paliperidone Janssen consists of only Module 1. Information on the scientific discussion can be found in  the  Xeplion  CHMP  assessment  reports  and  in  the  European  Public  Assessment  Report  (EPAR) published on the EMA website. The approved indication is:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

'Xeplion is indicated for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients stabilised with paliperidone or risperidone.

In selected adult patients with schizophrenia and previous responsiveness to oral paliperidone or risperidone, Xeplion may be used without prior stabilisation with oral treatment if psychotic symptoms are mild to moderate and a long-acting injectable treatment is needed'.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

Paliperidone Janssen is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC,  only  module  1  is  provided  whereas  module  3  of  the  present  duplicate  dossier cross-refers to the up-to-date module 3 of the original dossier (Xeplion), which have been assessed and approved, including all post-marketing procedures. The declaration submitted by the Applicant states  that  Paliperidone  Janssen  possesses  the  same  qualitative  and  quantitative  composition  in terms of active substances and same pharmaceutical form as Xeplion.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

Since  this  application  is  an  informed  consent  referring  to  Xeplion  marketing  authorisation,  the non-clinical data in support of the Paliperidone Janssen application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical  data  of  the  Xeplion  dossier,  which  have  been  assessed  and  approved  (including  all post-marketing procedures). Reference is made to the non-clinical documentation included in the Xeplion market authorisation application and no additional non-clinical data have been submitted.

The CHMP was of the view that paliperidone palmitate is not expected to result in an increase of risk to the environment.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

Since this is an informed consent application referring to the Xeplion marketing authorisation, the clinical data in support of the Paliperidone Janssen application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Xeplion dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). So reference is made to the clinical documentation included in the Xeplion file and no additional clinical data have been submitted which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.5. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

The Applicant has submitted a signed Summary of the Applicant's Pharmacovigilance System. The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements as set out in the Commission Implementing Regulation and as detailed in the GVP module.

## 2.6. Risk Management Plan

The RMP version 5.1 (approved with EMEA/H/C/000746/II/037, EC Decision date 23 May 2014) has been  submitted  by  the  MAA  within  an  informed  consent  marketing  authorization  application  in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC referring to paliperidone / paliperidone palmitate (EU/1/11/672/001-006  and  Agency  procedure  number  EMEA/H/C/002105)  as  the  reference

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

medicinal product for this application.  However, for the reference product a later version of the RMP (5.2, issued 2 September 2014) has been approved while the assessment of this informed consent procedure was ongoing. The contents of RMP versions 5.1 and 5.2 are identical with the exception of Part  1  (Product  Overview)  and  Part  VI  (Summary  of  Activities  in  the  Risk  Management  Plan  by Product)  which  are  updated  to  reflect  the  addition  of  the  medicinal  product  'Paliperidone prolonged-release  suspension  for  injection,  Janssen'  as  per  the  request  of  the  EMA.  A  separate assessment from the EMA Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of this RMP version has therefore not been required.

The RMP is in accordance with the GVP Module V. This product is not subject to additional monitoring.

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 5.1 was acceptable. However, it may necessitate  an  update  to  the  RMP  depending  on  the  results  of  the  ongoing  Signal  Management procedures:

- -Paliperidone - Accidential Exposure to product by Child (EPITT: 18069)
- -Paliperidone (INVEGA, XEPLION) and other atypical antipsychiotics = Acute renal failure (EPITT: 1802

The PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached.

The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 5.1 with the following content:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The RMP includes reference to relevant SmPC parts and no additional risk minimization activity has been proposed.

## 2.7. Product information

The proposed trade name, i.e. 'Paliperidone Janssen', was accepted by the EMA during the course of the procedure.

The company submitted subsequently a revised PI which was reviewed by the CHMP and considered as acceptable.

## 2.8. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant:

'Testing of the target patient group is not provided. The patient leaflet for \"Paliperidone prolonged release suspension for injection, Janssen\" is identical to the patient leaflet for XEPLION prolonged release suspension for injection excepting trade name. The XEPLION patient leaflet was bridged to the INVEGA prolonged-release tablets &amp; DORIBAX powder for solution for Infusion readibility tests and this approach was approved as part of XEPLION initial marketing authorisation application procedure (EMEA/H/C/002105) approved 04 March 2011.'

The CHMP considered that no further testing was warranted. It was also highlighted that in the future if the applicant wants to refer to the Paliperidone Janssen (EMEA/H/C/4066) package leaflet for bridging purposes, bridging regarding layout will not be acceptable.

## Braille

The Applicant was requested to update the labelling text in Annex III regarding braille in accordance with the comments on the PI. The amendments were satisfactorily done.

The submitted labelling text in Annex III is complete with Braille.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

The CHMP has previously reviewed data on quality, safety and efficacy of Xeplion and considered the benefit/risk ratio favourable. Given that Paliperidone Jansen 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 100+150 mg prolonged release suspension for injection are identical to Xeplion 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 100+150 mg prolonged release suspension for injection (including the product information), the benefit/risk ratio is considered to be favourable for Paliperidone Jansen 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 100+150 mg prolonged release suspension for injection.

Therefore the CHMP recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation for the following indication:

'Paliperidone  Janssen  is  indicated  for  maintenance  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in  adult  patients stabilised with paliperidone or risperidone.

In selected adult patients with schizophrenia and previous responsiveness to oral paliperidone or risperidone,  Paliperidone  Janssen  may  be  used  without  prior  stabilisation  with  oral  treatment  if psychotic symptoms are mild to moderate and a long-acting injectable treatment is needed'.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Paliperidone Jansen in the treatment of schizophrenia is favourable and  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  subject  to  the  following conditions:

## Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.

## Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation

## · Periodic Safety Update Reports

The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) ) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and  published on the European medicines web-portal.

## Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

## · Risk Management Plan (RMP)

The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP.

An updated RMP should be submitted:

- At the request of the European Medicines Agency;
