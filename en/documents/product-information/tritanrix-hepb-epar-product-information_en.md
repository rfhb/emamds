## Medicinal product no longer authorised ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Tritanrix HepB, suspension for injection

Diphtheria (D), tetanus (T), pertussis (whole cell) (Pw) and hepatitis B (rDNA) (HBV) vaccine (adsorbed)

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Medicinal product no longer authorised 1 dose (0.5 ml) contains: Diphtheria toxoid 1 not less than 30 IU Tetanus toxoid 1 not less than 60 IU Bordetella pertussis (inactivated) 2 not less than 4 IU Hepatitis B surface antigen 2,3 10 micrograms 1 Adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide, hydrated 0.26 milligrams Al 3+ 2 Adsorbed on aluminium phosphate 0.37 milligrams Al 3+ 3 Produced in yeast cells ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) by recombinant DNA technology For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension for injection. Turbid white suspension. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Tritanrix HepB is indicated for active immunisation against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and hepatitis B (HBV) in infants from 6 weeks onwards (see section 4.2). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The recommended dose is 0.5 ml. Primary vaccination: The primary vaccination schedule consists of three doses within the first six months of life.  Where HBV vaccine is not given at birth, the combined vaccine can be administered beginning as early as 8 weeks of age. Where there is a high endemicity of HBV, the practice to administer HBV vaccine at birth should be continued. In these circumstances, vaccination with the combined vaccine should start at 6 weeks of age. Three vaccine doses must be administered at intervals of at least 4 weeks.

When Tritanrix HepB is given according to the 6-10-14 weeks schedule, it is recommended to administer a dose of HBV vaccine at birth to improve protection.

In the case of children born of known HBV carrier mothers the immunoprophylactic measures for hepatitis B should not be modified. This may require separate vaccination with HBV and DTPw vaccines and also include the administration of HBIg at birth.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Booster vaccination:

A booster dose with Tritanrix HepB will give rise to increased reactogenicity as would be expected for a booster during the second year of life. In consequence, boostering should follow local recommendations.

The administration of a booster dose with trivalent DTP vaccine is recommended before the end of the second year of life. For long-term protection against HBV, a booster dose of HBV vaccine could also be administered after the first year of life. However, the need for this dose is currently not established.

As for any vaccination, the risk-benefit of immunising with Tritanrix HepB or deferring this vaccination should be weighed carefully in an infant or in a child suffering from a new onset or progression of a severe neurological disorder.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Method of administration Tritanrix HepB is for deep intramuscular injection, preferably in the anterolateral thigh. It is recommended that in patients with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders the vaccine be administered subcutaneously (see section 4.4). 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. Hypersensitivity after previous administration of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis or hepatitis B vaccines. The administration of Tritanrix HepB should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe febrile illness. Tritanrix HepB is contraindicated if the child has experienced an encephalopathy of unknown aetiology, occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine.  In these circumstances the vaccination course should be continued with DT and HBV vaccines. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Vaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to previous vaccination and possible occurrence of adverse reactions) and a clinical examination. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case of anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine. For this reason, the vaccinee should remain under medical supervision for 30 minutes after vaccination. If any of the following events occur in temporal relation to receipt of Tritanrix HepB, the decision to give subsequent doses of vaccine containing the pertussis component should be carefully considered. Temperature of ≥ 40.0 C within 48 hours, not due to another identifiable cause. Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours. Persistent crying lasting ≥ 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours. Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days. There may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits outweigh possible risks.

A history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions, a family history of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) and a family history of an adverse reaction following Tritanrix HepB vaccination do not constitute contra-indications.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

HIV infection is not considered as a contra-indication for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and HBV vaccination. The expected immunological response may not be obtained after vaccination of immunosuppressed patients, e.g. patients on immunosuppressive therapy.

Tritanrix HepB should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects.

## TRITANRIX HepB SHOULD UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE ADMINISTERED INTRAVENOUSLY.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction It is current practice in paediatric vaccination to co-administer different vaccines during the same session with injectable vaccines being administered at separate injection sites. Tritanrix HepB can be administered simultaneously at separate sites or in any temporal relationship with other paediatric vaccines if this fits conveniently in the immunisation scheme. In clinical studies, Tritanrix HepB has been administered simultaneously with oral polio vaccine (OPV) and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine. In these studies the immune response to the oral polio vaccine has not been investigated, however, previous experience with simultaneous administration of DTP, OPV and HBV vaccines has not shown any interference. In some clinical studies, Tritanrix HepB was used to reconstitute the lyophilised Hib vaccine (Hiberix); no interference in the immune response to any of the antigens was observed as compared to the responses observed following administration of the vaccines at separate sites (see section 6.2). In patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or patients with immunodeficiency, an adequate response may not be achieved. 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation As Tritanrix HepB is not intended for use in adults, information on the safety of the vaccine when used during pregnancy or lactation is not available. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Not relevant. 4.8 Undesirable effects · Clinical trials: In clinical studies, the most commonly reported adverse events were reactions at the injection site, including redness, swelling and pain.

General reactions that may occur in temporal association with Tritanrix HepB vaccination are listed below.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pharmaco-therapeutic group: Bacterial and viral vaccines combined, ATC code J07CA05.

Tritanrix HepB contains diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) toxoids, inactivated pertussis bacteria (Pw) and the purified major surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), adsorbed on aluminium salts.

The D and T toxoids are prepared from the toxins of cultures of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Clostridium tetani by formalin inactivation using established technology.  The Pw component is obtained by heat inactivation of phase I culture of Bordetella pertussis bacteria.

<!-- image -->

Medicinal product no longer authorised The surface antigen of the HBV (HBsAg) is produced by culture of genetically-engineered yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) which carry the gene coding for the major surface antigen of the HBV.  This HBsAg expressed in yeast cells is purified by several physico-chemical steps.  The HBsAg assembles spontaneously, in the absence of chemical treatment, into spherical particles of 20 nm in average diameter containing non-glycosylated HBsAg polypeptide and a lipid matrix consisting mainly of phospholipids. Extensive tests have demonstrated that these particles display the characteristic properties of the natural HBsAg. Four different schedules have been studied (6-10-14 weeks, 2-4-6 months; 3-4-5 months and 3-4½-6 months) according to routine vaccination practices in different countries with three doses administered within the first six months of life. For each component of the vaccine, the following immune responses have been documented one month after completion of the primary vaccination schedule. Percentage of subjects with antibody titres ≥ assay cut-off one month after primary vaccination with Tritanrix HepB: * in a subgroup of infants not administered hepatitis B vaccine at birth, 89.9% of subjects had anti-HBs titres ≥ 10 mIU/ml † cut-off accepted as indicative of protection †† vaccine response: % of subjects considered to have responded to the Bordetella pertussis antigen 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Evaluation of pharmacokinetic properties is not required for vaccines.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pharmaco-therapeutic group: Bacterial and viral vaccines combined, ATC code J07CA05.

Tritanrix HepB contains diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) toxoids, inactivated pertussis bacteria (Pw) and the purified major surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), adsorbed on aluminium salts.

The D and T toxoids are prepared from the toxins of cultures of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Clostridium tetani by formalin inactivation using established technology.  The Pw component is obtained by heat inactivation of phase I culture of Bordetella pertussis bacteria.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Medicinal product no longer authorised The surface antigen of the HBV (HBsAg) is produced by culture of genetically-engineered yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) which carry the gene coding for the major surface antigen of the HBV. This HBsAg expressed in yeast cells is purified by several physico-chemical steps.  The HBsAg assembles spontaneously, in the absence of chemical treatment, into spherical particles of 20 nm in average diameter containing non-glycosylated HBsAg polypeptide and a lipid matrix consisting mainly of phospholipids.  Extensive tests have demonstrated that these particles display the characteristic properties of the natural HBsAg. Four different schedules have been studied (6-10-14 weeks, 2-4-6 months; 3-4-5 months and 3-4½-6 months) according to routine vaccination practices in different countries with three doses administered within the first six months of life. For each component of the vaccine, the following immune responses have been documented one month after completion of the primary vaccination schedule. Percentage of subjects with antibody titres ≥ assay cut-off one month after primary vaccination with Tritanrix HepB: * in a subgroup of infants not administered hepatitis B vaccine at birth, 89.9% of subjects had anti-HBs titres ≥ 10 mIU/ml † cut-off accepted as indicative of protection †† vaccine response: % of subjects considered to have responded to the Bordetella pertussis antigen 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Evaluation of pharmacokinetic properties is not required for vaccines.

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on general safety studies.

Diphtheria (D), tetanus (T), pertussis (whole cell) (Pw) and hepatitis B (rDNA) (HBV) vaccine (adsorbed)

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before your child starts receiving this vaccine.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.

Medicinal product no longer authorised -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or your pharmacist. -This vaccine has been prescribed for your child. Do not pass it on to others. -If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist. In this leaflet: 1. What Tritanrix HepB is and what it is used for 2. Before your child receives Tritanrix HepB 3. How Tritanrix HepB is given 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Tritanrix HepB 6. Further information 1. WHAT TRITANRIX HepB IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR Tritanrix HepB is a vaccine used in children to prevent four diseases: diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), pertussis (whooping cough) and hepatitis B. The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these diseases. · Diphtheria : Diphtheria mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin.  Generally the airways become inflamed (swollen) causing severe breathing difficulties and sometimes suffocation.  The bacteria also release a toxin (poison), which can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and even death. · Tetanus (Lockjaw): Tetanus bacteria enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds in the skin. Wounds that are especially prone to infection are burns, fractures, deep wounds or wounds contaminated with soil, dust, horse manure/dung or wood splinters.  The bacteria release a toxin (poison), which can cause muscle stiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and even death.  The muscle spasms can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine. · Pertussis (Whooping cough): Pertussis is a highly infectious illness.  The disease affects the airways causing severe spells of coughing that may interfere with normal breathing.  The coughing is often accompanied by a 'whooping' sound, hence the common name 'whooping cough'.  The cough may last for 1-2 months or longer.  Pertussis can also cause ear infections, bronchitis which may last a long time, pneumonia, fits, brain damage and even death. · Hepatitis B : Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus.  It causes the liver to become inflamed and swollen .  The virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or saliva (spit) of infected people. Vaccination is the best way to protect against these diseases. None of the components in the vaccine are infectious.

## 2. BEFORE YOUR CHILD RECEIVES TRITANRIX HepB

## Tritanrix HepB should not be given:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- if your child has previously had any allergic reaction to Tritanrix HepB, or any ingredient contained in this vaccine.  The active substances and other ingredients in Tritanrix HepB are listed at the end of the leaflet.  Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue.
- if your child has previously had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough) or hepatitis B diseases.
- if your child experienced problems of the nervous system within 7 days after previous vaccination with a vaccine against pertussis (whooping cough) disease.

Medicinal product no longer authorised · if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C).  A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first. Take special care with Tritanrix HepB: · if your child has experienced any health problems after previous administration of a vaccine. · if after previously having Tritanrix HepB or another vaccine against pertussis (whooping cough) disease, your child had any problems, especially: ♦ A high temperature (over 40°C) within 48 hours of vaccination ♦ A collapse or shock-like state within 48 hours of vaccination ♦ Persistent crying lasting 3 hours or more within 48 hours of vaccination ♦ Seizures/fits with or without a high temperature within 3 days of vaccination · if your child is suffering from an undiagnosed or progressive disease of the brain or uncontrolled epilepsy. After control of the disease the vaccine should be administered · if your child has a bleeding problem or bruises easily · if your child has a tendency to seizures/fits due to a fever, or if there is a history in the family of this Using other medicines or vaccines Please tell your doctor if your child is taking or has recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or has recently received any other vaccine. Important information about some of the ingredients of Tritanrix HepB This medicinal product contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that your child may experience an allergic reaction. Tell your doctor if your child has any known allergies. 3. HOW TRITANRIX HepB IS GIVEN Your child will receive a total of three injections with an interval of at least one month between each one. Each injection is given on a separate visit. You will be informed by the doctor or nurse when you should come back for subsequent injections. If additional injections are necessary, the doctor will tell you. If your child misses a scheduled injection, talk to your doctor and arrange another visit. Make sure your child finishes the complete vaccination course of three injections.  If not, your child may not be fully protected against the diseases. The doctor will give Tritanrix HepB as an injection into the thigh muscle. Your child will remain under medical supervision for 30 minutes after each injection.

The vaccine should never be given into a vein.

## 4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS

Further information 1. WHAT TRITANRIX HepB IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR Tritanrix HepB is a vaccine used in children to prevent four diseases: diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), pertussis (whooping cough) and hepatitis B. The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these diseases. · Diphtheria : Diphtheria mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin.  Generally the airways become inflamed (swollen) causing severe breathing difficulties and sometimes suffocation.  The bacteria also release a toxin (poison), which can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and even death. · Tetanus (Lockjaw): Tetanus bacteria enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds in the skin. Wounds that are especially prone to infection are burns, fractures, deep wounds or wounds contaminated with soil, dust, horse manure/dung or wood splinters.  The bacteria release a toxin (poison), which can cause muscle stiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and even death.  The muscle spasms can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine. · Pertussis (Whooping cough): Pertussis is a highly infectious illness.  The disease affects the airways causing severe spells of coughing that may interfere with normal breathing.  The coughing is often accompanied by a 'whooping' sound, hence the common name 'whooping cough'.  The cough may last for 1-2 months or longer.  Pertussis can also cause ear infections, bronchitis which may last a long time, pneumonia, fits, brain damage and even death. · Hepatitis B : Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus.  It causes the liver to become inflamed and swollen.  The virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or saliva (spit) of infected people. Vaccination is the best way to protect against these diseases. None of the components in the vaccine are infectious.
