## 1.  Introduction

On 25 May 2022, the MAH submitted the completed EP00-502 Adult study for Omnitrope, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. The study included at least one paediatric patient(s) due to a protocol deviation.

These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure MEA 039.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2.  Scientific discussion

## 2.1.  Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study EP00-502 is a standalone study.

## 2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

## 2.3.  Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1.  Introduction

The active substance of Omnitrope is somatropin, a recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) produced by a genetically modified strain of Escherichia coli. Omnitrope is a biological medicinal product first authorized in the EU under the Biosimilar regulatory pathway. Studies have shown Omnitrope to have a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile to the reference medicinal product, Genotropin.

This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH:

The post-marketing surveillance (PMS), termed Patients Treated with Omnitrope (PATRO), was part of MAH's post-authorization commitment in the EU. Omnitrope (somatropin) has a marketing authorisation since 12-04-2006 and is used to treat paediatric and adult patients with growth hormone deficiency (GHD).

PATRO consists of two studies, the study EP00-501 in paediatric patients and the study EP00-502 in adult patients . The CHMP reclassified this post-authorization commitment in 2012 as a category 3 PASS.

The final CSR of study EP00-501 has been assessed in a separate art. 46 procedure in 2020 (EMEA/H/C/000607/MEA).

Study EP00-502 is an international, non-interventional, non-controlled, longitudinal, open, multi-center post-marketing surveillance, designed to record the safety and effectiveness of adult patients treated with Omnitrope within routine clinical practice. Patient enrolment began in Sep-2007 and 1500 patients were planned to be enrolled. Due to a protocol deviation, several patients were enrolled in this study who were under the age of 18. Submission of the study results of these paediatric patients within an art. 46 procedure was therefore deemed necessary by EMA.

In this assessment report, the data of these paediatric patients will be discussed.

## 2.3.2.  Clinical study EP00-502

## Description

## Methods

This study was an international, non-interventional, non-controlled, longitudinal, open, multi-center PMS, designed to record the safety and effectiveness data of adult patients treated with Omnitrope within routine clinical practice.

## Study participants

Adult patients treated with Omnitrope within routine clinical practice.

## Treatments

Omnitrope (powder and solvent for solution for injection and/or solution for injection) was administered subcutaneously using the appropriate medical device for Omnitrope according to the marketing authorization in the respective countries.

## Objective(s)

Primary objective - to collect and analyse the long-term safety of Omnitrope in adults treated within routine clinical practice. Particular emphasis is laid on the following aspects:

-  Risks of glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus.
-  Occurrence of malignancies.

Secondary objective - to monitor the treated population and to collect data on the effectiveness of Omnitrope treatment, as follows:

-  Evaluation of IGF-1 levels.
-  Evaluation of parameters of lipid spectrum as surrogate for cardiovascular risk factors.
-  Evaluation of body composition (BMI, waist/hip circumference ratio, and decrease of total fat mass).
-  Characteristics of Omnitrope treatment such as posology in adults.
-  Description and outcome of QoL questionnaires, if applicable.

## Outcomes/endpoints

See objectives.

## Sample size

1500 patients were planned to be enrolled over five years in Europe (aiming for overall 7500 patientyears of data).

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

This was an observational study, no randomisation and blinding was conducted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical Methods

Statistical tests were not performed and consequently p-values to indicate statistical significant differences were not provided.

Descriptive analysis of all available parameters are performed displaying the following:

- Continuous parameters (e.g. age, height, weight): n, mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, maximum, median, number of missing values, 1st and 3rd quartiles.
- Categorical parameters (e.g. sex): frequency and percentage in each category, number of missing values.

## Results

## Participant flow

Among the patients who were documented in the NIS EP00-502 PATRO Adults, 5 patients started growth hormone (GH) treatment as adolescents (16-17 years of age).

## Recruitment

Two patients were enrolled in France, two in the UK and one in Spain.

## Baseline data

All 5 patients (2 male and 3 female) had childhood onset of GHD; 1 patient with isolated GHD was GH treatment naïve, and 4 patients with additional hormone deficiencies were GH-pretreated. The females received concomitant oestrogen/progesterone treatment.

## IGF-1

After 1.5 years, the median (IQR) IGF-1 SDS peaked in most of the patients. Between baseline and 5 years visit, the median IGF-1 SDS was between -2.04 and -0.82 in naïve patients and between -0.52 and -0.17 in pre-treated patients.

## Safety results

None of the 5 pediatric patients was diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus by the investigator nor had any laboratory findings indicative for meeting the WHO (2016) diabetes mellitus criteria which is defined as FPG ≥ 7.0 mmol/L or 2-h plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L during OGTT or HbA1c ≥ 6.5%. None of the 5 paediatric patients had a pre-existing Diabetes Mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance as concurrent disease.

None of the 5 pediatric patients was diagnosed with a new malignancy or a re-occurrence of a preexisting malignancy.

Overall, 19 adverse events (AEs) were reported in those 5 patients of which one was serious (see SAE). No AE or severe adverse event (SAE) had a suspected causal relationship to Omnitrope treatment.

One SAE with moderate intensity occurred (verbatim: decompensation of pituitary insufficiency), and the event completely resolved. Causality with Omnitrope treatment was not suspected.

One AE led to reduction of the Omnitrope dose (mild hypertension, which completely resolved).

## 2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects

Within this P46 procedure, the MAH has submitted data from 5 paediatric patients who were included as protocol deviation in adult PASS study EP00-502 and were treated with Omnitrope.

In line with the paediatric study EP00-501, the primary objectives were to further characterize the safety of long-term Omnitrope treatment, especially with respect to risks of glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus and the occurrence of malignancies. IGF-1 levels were measured as effectiveness parameter. No growth velocity and final height was collected per protocol as this was designed as an adult study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The 5 paediatric patients included were 16-17 years of age at the start of treatment. Four of the patients were pre-treated with GH. The median Omnitrope treatment duration was 7.10 years (range 1.5 to 12.6 years). Given the small number of paediatric patients in this study, no meaningful conclusions can be drawn. Nevertheless, the data is in concurrence with the data from 7359 paediatric patients in study EP00501. No safety issues were identified with respect to the occurrence of malignancies and the development of glucose intolerance and diabetes. The observed AEs were mild to moderate, resolved and were not judged as related to study treatment. This conclusion can be agreed. IGF-1 levels were in general within -2 to +2 SDS starting from baseline, which is expected as 4 out of 5 patients were pre-treated with GH. Overall, the final study data support safety and efficacy of Omnitrope throughout the range of indications in paediatric patients &lt; 18 years of age. No further action with regard to the SmPC is considered necessary.

## 3.  Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The data from 5 paediatric patients is in line with the 7359 paediatric patients in study EP00-501. The safety and effectiveness data as presented in the subset of paediatric patients are in general as expected and do not give rise to any concerns with regard to long term safety or the effectiveness of the product. P46 considered fulfilled. No regulatory action required.
