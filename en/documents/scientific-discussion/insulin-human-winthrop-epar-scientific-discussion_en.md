## 1. Introduction

This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended.

Therefore,  consent  from  the  MAH  of  the  Insuman  application  has  been  given  allowing  access  to Module  2  to  Module  5  of  the  initial  dossier  of  this  authorised  product  and  any  subsequent  postmarketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved.

As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Insulin Human Winthrop medicinal product are identical to the up-to-date quality, safety and efficacy profile of Insuman. Information on the scientific discussions can be found in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).

The  approved  indication  is:  'Diabetes  mellitus  where  treatment  with  insulin  is  required.  Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid is also suitable for the treatment of hyperglycaemic coma and ketoacidosis, as well as for achieving pre-, intra- and post-operative stabilisation in patients with diabetes mellitus'. 2. Quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects Since this application is an informed consent of the Insuman application, the quality, non-clinical and clinical  data  in  support  of  the  Insulin  Human  Winthrop  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date quality,  non-clinical  and  clinical  data  of  the  Insuman  dossier  that  have  been  assessed  and  approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 3. Pharmacovigilance PSUR As requested by the applicant and agreed by the CHMP, the PSUR cycle of Insulin Human Winthrop will correspond to the one attributed to the cross-referred product, Insuman, unless otherwise specified. Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements. Risk Management Plan The applicant submitted a risk management plan. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that the applicant  should  provide  an  updated  Risk  Management  Plan  which  is  in  line with  the  CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, within three months following the European Commission Decision on the granting of the marketing authorisation.

## 4. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

Since this application is an informed consent of the Insuman application, the CHMP considered that the risk-benefit balance of Insulin Human Winthrop was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation for the following indication:

'Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid is also suitable  for  the  treatment  of  hyperglycaemic  coma  and  ketoacidosis,  as  well  as  for  achieving  pre-, intra- and post-operative stabilisation in patients with diabetes mellitus.'
