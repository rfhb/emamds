## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Columvi in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (DLBCL NOS) who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).

Columvi as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), after two or more lines of systemic therapy.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Columvi must only be administered under the supervision of a healthcare professional experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients and who has access to appropriate medical support to manage severe reactions associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cellassociated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At least 1 dose of tocilizumab for use in the event of CRS must be available prior to Columvi infusion at Cycles 1 and 2. Access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of use of the previous tocilizumab dose must be ensured (see section 4.4).

## Pre-treatment with obinutuzumab

All patients in study NP30179 and in study GO41944 (STARGLO) received a single 1 000 mg dose of obinutuzumab as pre-treatment on Cycle 1 Day 1 (7 days prior to initiation of Columvi treatment) to lower the circulating and lymphoid B cells (see Table 2, Delayed or Missed Doses , and section 5.1).

Obinutuzumab was administered as an intravenous infusion at 50 mg/h. The rate of infusion was escalated in 50 mg/h increments every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/h.

Refer to the obinutuzumab prescribing information for complete information on premedication, preparation, administration and management of adverse reactions of obinutuzumab.

a Refer to ' Pre-treatment with obinutuzumab ' described above.

b  Cycles 1-8: Administer gemcitabine before oxaliplatin.

c  For patients who experience CRS with their previous dose of Columvi, the time of infusion may be extended up to 8 hours (see section 4.4).

d  Cycles 2-8: Administer Columvi before gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. Gemcitabine and oxaliplatin may be given on Day 1 or 2.

e Infusion time may be shortened to 2 hours at the discretion of the treating physician, if the previous infusion was well tolerated. If the patient experienced CRS with a previous dose, the duration of infusion should be maintained at 4 hours.

## Patient monitoring

-  When Columvi is given as monotherapy, patients must be monitored for signs and symptoms of potential CRS during all Columvi infusions and for at least 10 hours after completion of the infusion of the first Columvi dose (2.5 mg on Cycle 1 Day 8) (see section 4.8).
-  When Columvi is given in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, patients must be monitored for signs and symptoms of potential CRS during all Columvi infusions and for 4 hours after completion of the first Columvi dose (2.5 mg on Cycle 1 Day 8) (see section 4.8).

Patients who experienced Grade ≥ 2 CRS with their previous infusion should be monitored after completion of the infusion (see Table 4 in section 4.2).

All patients must be monitored for signs and symptoms of CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) following Columvi administration.

All patients must be counselled on the risk, signs and symptoms of CRS and ICANS and advised to contact the healthcare provider immediately should they experience signs and symptoms of CRS and/or ICANS at any time (see section 4.4).

## Duration of treatment

Treatment with Columvi monotherapy is recommended for a maximum of 12 cycles or until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity, whichever occurs first. Each cycle is 21 days.

Treatment with Columvi in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin is recommended for 8 cycles, followed by 4 cycles of Columvi monotherapy for a maximum of 12 cycles of Columvi in total or until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity, whichever occurs first. Each cycle is 21 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Delayed or missed doses

During step-up dosing (weekly dosing):

-  Following pre-treatment with obinutuzumab, if the Columvi 2.5 mg dose is delayed by more than 1 week, then repeat pre-treatment with obinutuzumab.
-  Following Columvi 2.5 mg dose or 10 mg dose, if there is a Columvi treatment-free interval of 2 weeks to 6 weeks, then repeat the last tolerated Columvi dose and resume the planned step-up dosing.
-  Following Columvi 2.5 mg dose or 10 mg dose, if there is a Columvi treatment-free interval of more than 6 weeks, then repeat pre-treatment with obinutuzumab and Columvi step-up dosing (see Cycle 1 in Table 2 and Table 3).

## After Cycle 2 (30 mg dose):

-  If there is a Columvi treatment-free interval of more than 6 weeks between cycles, then repeat pre-treatment with obinutuzumab and Columvi step-up dosing (see Cycle 1 in Table 2 and Table 3), and then resume the planned treatment cycle (30 mg dose).

## Dose modifications

No dose reductions of Columvi are recommended.

## Management of cytokine release syndrome

CRS should be identified based on the clinical presentation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients should be evaluated for other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension, such as infections or sepsis. If CRS is suspected, it should be managed according to the CRS management recommendations based on American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) consensus grading in Table 4.

-  If no improvement within 8 hours or rapid progression of CRS, administer second dose of tocilizumab 4
-  After 2 doses of tocilizumab, consider alternative anti-cytokine therapy and/or alternative immunosuppressant therapy

If 2 doses of tocilizumab were used within the last 6 weeks:

-  Administer only one dose of tocilizumab 4
-  If no improvement within 8 hours or rapid progression of CRS, consider alternative anti-cytokine therapy and/or alternative immunosuppressant therapy

1  ASTCT consensus grading criteria (Lee 2019).

2 Duration of infusion may be extended up to 8 hours, as appropriate for that cycle (see Table 2).

3  Corticosteroids (e.g., 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone, 100 mg intravenous prednisolone, 1-2 mg/kg intravenous methylprednisolone per day, or equivalent).

4  Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously (not to exceed 800 mg), as administered in Study NP30179.

5 See section 4.8 for frequency and time to onset of Grade ≥ 2 CRS following Columvi 10 mg and 30 mg doses.

Management of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS)

At the first sign of ICANS, based on the type and severity, consider supportive therapy, neurology evaluation, and withholding Columvi (see Table 5). Rule out other causes of neurologic symptoms. If ICANS is suspected, it should be managed according to the recommendations in Table 5.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required in patients 65 years of age and older (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt; upper limit of normal [ULN] to ≤ 1.5  ULN or aspartate transaminase [AST] &gt; ULN). Columvi has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30 to &lt; 90 mL/min). Columvi has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Columvi in children below 18 years of age have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Columvi is for intravenous use only.

Columvi must be diluted by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique, prior to intravenous administration. It must be administered as an intravenous infusion through a dedicated infusion line.

Columvi must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus.

For instructions on dilution of Columvi before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to obinutuzumab, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

For specific contraindications on obinutuzumab, please refer to the obinutuzumab prescribing information.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## CD20-negative disease

There are limited data available on patients with CD20-negative DLBCL treated with Columvi and it is possible that patients with CD20-negative DLBCL may have less benefit compared to patients with CD20-positive DLBCL. The potential risks and benefits associated with treatment of patients with CD20-negative DLBCL with Columvi should be considered.

## Cytokine release syndrome

CRS, including life-threatening reactions, has been reported in patients receiving Columvi (see section 4.8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most common manifestations of CRS were pyrexia, tachycardia, hypotension, chills and hypoxia. Infusion-related reactions may be clinically indistinguishable from manifestations of CRS.

Most CRS events occurred following the first dose of Columvi. Elevated liver function tests (AST and alanine transaminase [ALT] &gt; 3  ULN and/or total bilirubin &gt; 2  ULN) concurrent with CRS have been reported after Columvi use (see section 4.8).

Patients in studies NP30179 and GO41944 (STARGLO) were pre-treated with obinutuzumab to lower the circulating and lymphoid B cells, 7 days prior to initiation of Columvi therapy. All patients should be premedicated with an anti-pyretic, antihistamine, and a glucocorticoid (see Table 1).

At least 1 dose of tocilizumab for use in the event of CRS must be available prior to Columvi infusion at Cycles 1 and 2. Access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of use of the previous tocilizumab dose must be ensured.

When Columvi is given as monotherapy, patients must be monitored during all Columvi infusions and for at least 10 hours after completion of the first infusion.

When Columvi is given in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, patients must be monitored during all Columvi infusions and for 4 hours after completion of the first infusion.

For complete information on monitoring, see section 4.2. Patients must be counselled to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time (see Patient card below).

Patients should be evaluated for other causes of fever, hypoxia and hypotension, such as infections or sepsis. CRS should be managed based on the patient's clinical presentation and according to the CRS management guidance provided in Table 4 (section 4.2).

## Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome

Serious cases of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) which could be life-threatening or fatal have occurred following treatment with Columvi (see section 4.8).

The onset of ICANS can be concurrent with CRS, following resolution of CRS, or in the absence of CRS. Clinical signs and symptoms of ICANS may include but are not limited to confusion, depressed level of consciousness, disorientation, seizure, aphasia, and dysgraphia.

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of ICANS following Columvi administration and treated promptly. Patients must be counselled to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms occur at any time (see Patient card below).

At the first signs or symptoms of ICANS, manage according to the ICANS guidance provided in Table 5. Treatment with Columvi should be withheld or discontinued permanently as recommended.

## Patient card

The prescriber must inform the patient of the risk of CRS and ICANS and the signs and symptoms of CRS and ICANS. Patients must be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs and symptoms of CRS and ICANS. Patients should be provided with the patient card and instructed to carry the card at all times. This card describes symptoms of CRS and ICANS which, if experienced, should prompt the patient to seek immediate medical attention.

## Interaction with CYP450 substrates

The initial release of cytokines associated with the start of Columvi treatment could suppress CYP450 enzymes and lead to fluctuations in concentrations of concomitantly administered drugs. On initiation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of Columvi therapy, patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be monitored as fluctuations in the concentration of concomitant drugs may lead to toxicity, loss of effect or adverse events (see section 4.5).

## Serious infections

Serious infections, including opportunistic infections, have occurred in patients treated with Columvi (see section 4.8).

Columvi must not be administered to patients with an active infection. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of Columvi in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent infection, those with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infections, or those who have had significant prior immunosuppressive treatment. Administer prophylactic antimicrobials, as appropriate. Patients should be monitored before and during Columvi treatment for the emergence of possible bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral infections and treated appropriately.

Columvi should be temporarily withheld in the presence of an active infection until the infection has resolved. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur.

Febrile neutropenia has been reported during treatment with Columvi. Patients with febrile neutropenia should be evaluated for infection and treated promptly.

## Tumour flare

Tumour flare has been reported in patients receiving Columvi (see section 4.8). Manifestations included localised pain and swelling.

Consistent with the mechanism of action of Columvi, tumour flare is likely due to the influx of T cells into tumour sites following Columvi administration and may mimic progression of disease. Tumour flare does not imply treatment failure or represent tumour progression.

Specific risk factors for tumour flare have not been identified, however, there is a heightened risk of compromise and morbidity due to mass effect secondary to tumour flare in patients with bulky tumours located in close proximity to airways and/or a vital organ. Monitoring and evaluation for tumour flare at critical anatomical sites is recommended in patients treated with Columvi and managed as clinically indicated. Corticosteroids and analgesics should be considered to treat tumour flare.

## Tumour lysis syndrome

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported in patients receiving Columvi (see section 4.8). Patients with high tumour burden, rapidly proliferative tumours, renal dysfunction or dehydration are at greater risk of tumour lysis syndrome.

Patients at risk should be monitored closely by appropriate laboratory and clinical tests for electrolyte status, hydration and renal function. Appropriate prophylactic measures with anti-hyperuricaemics (e.g., allopurinol or rasburicase) and adequate hydration should be considered prior to obinutuzumab pre-treatment and prior to Columvi infusion.

Management of TLS may include aggressive hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, anti-hyperuricaemic therapy and supportive care.

## Immunisation

The safety of immunisation with live vaccines during or following Columvi therapy has not been studied. Immunisation with live vaccines is not recommended during Columvi therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Polysorbates

This medicinal product contains 1.25 mg of polysorbate 20 in each 2.5 mL vial and 5 mg of polysorbate 20 in each 10 mL vial, which is equivalent to 0.5 mg/mL.

Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed. No interactions with Columvi are expected via the cytochrome P450 enzymes, other metabolising enzymes or transporters.

The initial release of cytokines associated with the start of Columvi treatment could suppress CYP450 enzymes. The highest drug-drug interaction risk is during the period of one week following each of the first 2 doses of Columvi (i.e., Cycle 1 Day 8 and 15) in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., warfarin, cyclosporine). On initiation of Columvi therapy, patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be monitored.

The pharmacokinetics (PK) of glofitamab are not affected by co-administration with gemcitabine or oxaliplatin.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception

Female patients of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive methods during treatment with Columvi and for at least 2 months following the last dose of Columvi.

## Pregnancy

There are no data on the use of Columvi in pregnant women. No reproductive toxicity studies have been performed in animals (see section 5.3).

Glofitamab is an immunoglobulin G (IgG). IgG is known to cross the placenta. Based on its mechanism of action, glofitamab is likely to cause foetal B-cell depletion when administered to a pregnant woman.

Columvi is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Female patients receiving Columvi should be advised of the potential harm to the foetus. Female patients should be advised to contact the treating physician, should pregnancy occur.

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether glofitamab is excreted in human milk. No studies have been conducted to assess the impact of glofitamab on milk production or its presence in breast milk. Human IgG is known to be present in human milk. The potential for absorption of glofitamab and the potential for adverse reactions in the breast-feeding child is unknown. Women should be advised to discontinue breast-feeding during treatment with Columvi and for 2 months after the final dose of Columvi.

## Fertility

No human data on fertility are available. No fertility assessments in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of glofitamab on fertility (see section 5.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Columvi has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Due to the potential for ICANS, patients receiving Columvi are at risk of depressed level of consciousness (see section 4.4). Patients should be instructed to avoid driving or operating machines for 48 hours after each of the first two doses during the step-up dosing and in the event of new onset of any symptoms of ICANS (confusion, disorientation, depressed level of consciousness) and/or CRS (pyrexia, tachycardia, hypotension, chills, hypoxia) until symptoms resolve (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no experience with overdose in clinical trials. In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates, ATC code: L01FX28

## Mechanism of action

Glofitamab is a bispecific monoclonal antibody that binds bivalently to CD20 expressed on the surface of B cells and monovalently to CD3 in the T-cell receptor complex expressed on the surface of T cells. By simultaneous binding to CD20 on the B cell and CD3 on the T cell, glofitamab mediates the formation of an immunological synapse with subsequent T-cell activation and proliferation, secretion of cytokines and release of cytolytic proteins that results in the lysis of CD20-expressing B cells.

## Pharmacodynamics

In study NP30179, 84% (84/100) of patients were already B-cell depleted (&lt; 70 cells/µL) before pretreatment with obinutuzumab. The proportion of patients with B-cell depletion increased to 100% (94/94) after obinutuzumab pre-treatment prior to Columvi treatment initiation, and B-cell counts remained low during Columvi treatment.

During Cycle 1 (step-up dosing), transient increases in plasma IL-6 levels were observed at 6 hours post Columvi infusion, which remained elevated at 20 hours post-infusion and returned to baseline prior to the next infusion.

In study GO41944 (STARGLO), 63.9% (115/180) of patients were already B-cell depleted (&lt; 70 cells/µL) before pre-treatment with obinutuzumab. The proportion of patients with B-cell depletion increased to 79.4% (143/180) after obinutuzumab pre-treatment prior to Columvi treatment initiation, and B-cell counts remained low during Columvi treatment.

## Cardiac electrophysiology

In study NP30179, 16/145 patients who were exposed to Columvi experienced a post-baseline QTc value &gt; 450 ms. One of these cases was assessed to be of clinical significance by the investigator. No patients discontinued treatment due to QTc prolongation.

In study GO41944 (STARGLO), 16/172 patients who were exposed to Columvi experienced a postbaseline QTc value &gt; 450 ms. No patients discontinued treatment due to QTc prolongation.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Relapsed or refractory DLBCL

## Columvi monotherapy

An open-label multicentre, multi-cohort trial (NP30179) was conducted to evaluate Columvi in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In the single-arm monotherapy DLBCL cohort (n=108), patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL were required to have received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy, including an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and an anthracycline agent. Patients with FL3b and Richter transformation were not eligible. Patients were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

expected to present CD20-positive DLBCL, but biomarker eligibility was not a requirement for inclusion (see section 4.4).

The study excluded patients with ECOG performance status ≥ 2, significant cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the last 6 months, unstable arrhythmias, or unstable angina), significant active pulmonary disease, impaired renal functions (CrCL &lt; 50 mL/min with elevated serum creatinine level), active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy, active infections (i.e., chronic active EBV, acute or chronic hepatitis C, hepatitis B, HIV), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, current or a history of CNS lymphoma or CNS disease, a history of macrophage activation syndrome / hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, prior allogeneic stem cell transplant, prior organ transplantation, or hepatic transaminases ≥ 3 × ULN.

All patients received pre-treatment with obinutuzumab at Cycle 1 Day 1. Patients received 2.5 mg of Columvi at Cycle 1 Day 8, 10 mg of Columvi at Cycle 1 Day 15, and 30 mg of Columvi at Cycle 2 Day 1 as per the step-up dosing schedule. Patients continued to receive 30 mg of Columvi on Day 1 of Cycles 3 to 12. The duration of each cycle was 21 days. Patients received a median of 5 cycles of Columvi treatment (range: 1 to 13 cycles); 34.7% received 8 or more cycles and 25.7% received 12 cycles of Columvi treatment.

The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were: median age 66 years (range: 21 to 90 years) with 53.7% aged 65 years or older and 15.7% aged 75 years or older; 69.4% males; 74.1% white, 5.6% Asian and 0.9% Black or African American; 5.6% Hispanic or Latino; and ECOG performance status of 0 (46.3%) or 1 (52.8%). Most patients (71.3%) had DLBCL not otherwise specified, 7.4% had DLBCL transformed from follicular lymphoma, 8.3% had high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) or another histology transformed from follicular lymphoma, 7.4% had HGBCL, and 5.6% had primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). The median number of prior lines of therapy was 3 (range: 2 to 7); 39.8% of patients received 2 prior lines and 60.2% received 3 or more prior lines of therapy. All patients had received prior chemotherapy (all patients received alkylator therapy and 98.1% of patients received anthracycline therapy) and all patients had received prior anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy; 35.2% of patients had received prior CAR T-cell therapy, and 16.7% of patients had received autologous stem cell transplant. Most patients (89.8%) had refractory disease, 60.2% of patients had primary refractory disease and 83.3% of patients were refractory to their last prior therapy.

The primary efficacy outcome measure was complete response (CR) rate as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) using 2014 Lugano criteria. The overall median duration of follow-up was 15 months (range: 0 to 21 months). The secondary efficacy outcome measures included overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), duration of complete response (DOCR), and time to first complete response (TFCR) as assessed by IRC.

Efficacy results are summarised in Table 8.

## Columvi in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin

The efficacy of Columvi in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (Columvi+GemOx) was evaluated in study GO41944 (STARGLO), an open-label multicentre, randomised clinical trial in 274 patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL not otherwise specified (DLBCL NOS).

The study included patients with DLBCL NOS who received only one prior line of therapy who were not candidates for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), or who had received ≥ 2 prior therapies. Patients were required to have ECOG performance status ≤ 2, CrCL ≥ 30 mL/min, hepatic transaminases ≤ 2.5 × ULN, no significant cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the last 3 months, unstable arrhythmias, or unstable angina) and no current or prior CNS lymphoma or CNS disease, no active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy, no active infections (i.e., chronic active EBV, active hepatitis B, hepatitis C), and no history of any of the following: HIV, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, prior allogeneic stem cell transplant, or prior organ transplantation. Patients with HGBCL, PMBCL, or history of transformation of indolent disease to DLBCL were excluded.

Patients who received only one prior line of therapy were not considered candidates for transplant if they met at least one of the following criteria: age ≥ 70 years, ECOG performance status 2, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%, insufficient response to salvage therapy prior to ASCT, CrCL ≤ 45 mL/min, other comorbidities or criteria that preclude use of transplant based on local practice standards or in the investigator's opinion, or patient refusal of high-dose chemotherapy and/or transplant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive Columvi+GemOx (N=183) or rituximab in combination with gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (R-GemOx; N=91) for 8 cycles, followed by 4 additional cycles of Columvi monotherapy for patients in the Columvi+GemOx arm. Randomisation was stratified by number of previous lines of systemic therapy for DLBCL (1 vs. ≥ 2) and outcome of last systemic therapy (relapsed vs. refractory).

In the Columvi+GemOx arm, patients received pre-treatment with obinutuzumab at Cycle 1 Day 1 followed by 2.5 mg of Columvi at Cycle 1 Day 8, 10 mg of Columvi at Cycle 1 Day 15, and 30 mg of Columvi at Cycle 2 Day 1 as per the step-up dosing schedule. Patients continued to receive 30 mg of Columvi on Day 1 of Cycles 3 to 12. Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m 2 ) and oxaliplatin (100 mg/m 2 ) were administered intravenously on Day 2 of Cycle 1 and then on Day 1 of subsequent cycles, up to Cycle 8. The duration of each cycle was 21 days in both arms. Patients received a median of 11 cycles of Columvi treatment (range: 1 to 13 cycles); 64.5% received 8 or more cycles and 44.8% received 12 cycles of Columvi treatment.

The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were: median age 68 years (range: 20 to 88 years) with 62.8% aged 65 years or older and 23.7% aged 75 years or older; 57.7% males; 42% white, 50% Asian, and 1.1% Black or African American; 5.8% Hispanic or Latino; and ECOG performance status of 0 (43.3%), 1 (46.6%), or 2 (10.1%). The majority of patients (62.8%) had received 1 prior line of systemic therapy; 37.2% of patients received 2 or more prior lines. All patients had received prior chemotherapy and most (98.5%) had received prior anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy; 7.7% of patients had received prior CAR T-cell therapy, and 4.0% of patients had received autologous stem cell transplant. The majority of patients (66.8%) had refractory disease, 55.8% of patients had primary refractory disease, and 60.6% of patients were refractory to their last prior therapy. The most common reasons why patients were not considered candidates for transplant included age (42.3%), patient refused high-dose chemotherapy and/or transplant (34.7%), and insufficient response to salvage therapy (9.9%).

The primary efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). At the time of the prespecified primary analysis, a statistically significant improvement in OS was observed for patients randomised to the Columvi+GemOx arm compared to patients randomised to R-GemOx (HR 0.59, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.89; p-value=0.011). Median OS in the R-GemOx arm was 9.0 months (95% CI: 7.3, 14.4) and was not reached in the Columvi+GemOx arm (95% CI: 13.8, NE). Statistically significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and CR rate, as assessed by an IRC, were also observed with Columvi+GemOx over R-GemOx. Median PFS was 12.1 months (95% CI: 6.8, 18.3) in the Columvi+GemOx arm versus 3.3 months (95% CI: 2.5, 5.6) in the R-GemOx arm (HR 0.37, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.55; p-value&lt;0.001). The rate of complete response was 50.3% with Columvi+GemOx versus 22.0% with R-GemOx, a difference of 28.3% (p-value&lt;0.001).

Overall survival, PFS, and CR results from an updated analysis conducted after an additional 10.5 months of follow-up continue to demonstrate benefit of Columvi+GemOx over R-GemOx. The key results are summarised in Table 9. Kaplan-Meier plots for OS and PFS from the updated analysis are presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively. Exploratory subgroup analysis at the time of the updated analysis showed an OS hazard ratio of 1.09 (95% CI: 0.54, 2.18) and PFS hazard ratio of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.44, 1.59) for patients enrolled in Europe.

## Immunogenicity

Across studies, of 608 patients, only 4 patients (0.7%) were negative for anti-glofitamab antibodies at baseline and became positive following treatment. Due to the limited number of patients with antibodies against glofitamab, no conclusions can be drawn concerning a potential effect of immunogenicity on efficacy or safety.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Columvi in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of mature B-cell neoplasms (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Non-compartmental analyses indicate that glofitamab serum concentration reaches the maximal level (Cmax) at the end of infusion and declines in a bi-exponential fashion. Glofitamab exhibits linear and dose-proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range studied (0.005 to 30 mg) and is independent of time.

## Absorption

Columvi is administered as an intravenous infusion. Peak concentration of glofitamab (Cmax) was reached at the end of the infusion.

## Distribution

Following intravenous administration, the central volume of distribution was 3.34 L, which is close to total serum volume. The peripheral volume of distribution was 2.35 L.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Biotransformation

The metabolism of glofitamab has not been studied. Antibodies are cleared principally by catabolism.

## Elimination

The glofitamab serum concentration-time data are described by a population pharmacokinetic model with two compartments, and both time-independent clearance and time-varying clearance.

The time-independent clearance pathway was estimated as 0.633 L/day and the initial time-varying clearance pathway as 0.814 L/day, with an exponential decay over time (Kdes ~ 1.5/day). The estimated decay half-life from the initial total clearance value to the time-independent clearance only was estimated as 0.471 days.

The effective half-life in the linear phase (i.e., after the contribution of time-varying clearance has collapsed to a negligible amount) is 7.92 days (geometric mean, 95% CI: 4.69, 11.90) based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No differences in glofitamab exposure were noted in patients 65 years of age and older and those under 65 years based on population pharmacokinetic analysis.

## Renal impairment

The population pharmacokinetic analysis of glofitamab showed that creatinine clearance does not affect the pharmacokinetics of glofitamab. The pharmacokinetics of glofitamab in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30 to &lt; 90 mL/min) were similar to those in patients with normal renal function. Columvi has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment.

## Hepatic impairment

Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed mild hepatic impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of glofitamab. The pharmacokinetics of glofitamab in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt; ULN to ≤ 1.5  ULN or AST &gt; ULN) were similar to those with normal hepatic functions. Columvi has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.

## Effects of age, gender and body weight

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of glofitamab were observed based on age (21 years to 90 years), gender and body weight (31 kg to 148 kg).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

No studies have been conducted to establish the carcinogenic potential and mutagenic potential of glofitamab.

## Fertility

No fertility assessments in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of glofitamab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reproductive toxicity

No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of glofitamab. Based on low placental transfer of antibodies during the first trimester, the mechanism of action of glofitamab (B-cell depletion, target-dependent T-cell activation, and cytokine release), the available safety data with glofitamab and data on other anti-CD20 antibodies, the risk for teratogenicity is low. Prolonged B-cell depletion can lead to increased risk of opportunistic infection, which may cause foetal loss. Transient CRS associated with Columvi administration may also be harmful to the foetus (see section 4.6).

## Systemic toxicity

In a study in cynomolgus monkeys, animals experiencing severe CRS after a single intravenous dose of glofitamab (0.1 mg/kg) without obinutuzumab pre-treatment had erosions in the gastrointestinal tract and inflammatory cell infiltrates in spleen and sinusoids of the liver and sporadically in some other organs. These inflammatory cell infiltrates were likely secondary to cytokine-induced immune cell activation. Pre-treatment with obinutuzumab resulted in the attenuation of glofitamab-induced cytokine release and related adverse effects by depleting B cells in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue. This allowed at least 10 times higher doses of glofitamab (1 mg/kg) in cynomolgus monkeys resulting in a Cmax of up to 3.74 times the human Cmax at the recommended 30 mg dose.

All findings with glofitamab were considered pharmacologically mediated effects and reversible. Studies longer than 4 weeks were not performed, as glofitamab was highly immunogenic in cynomolgus monkeys and led to loss of exposure and loss of the pharmacologic effect.

As all relapsed or refractory DLBCL patients to be treated have been exposed to anti-CD20 treatment before, the majority will likely have low levels of circulating B cells due to residual effects of prior anti-CD20 therapy, before treatment with obinutuzumab. Therefore, the animal model without prior rituximab (or other anti-CD20) treatment may not fully reflect the clinical context.

Preparation of intravenous syringe infusion (2.5 mg dose only)

Use a two-syringe method with a connector to prepare the dose. The final volume of the diluted solution is 25 mL.

-  Withdraw 22.5 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection from an infusion bag into a syringe of the appropriate size (e.g., 30 mL).
-  Withdraw 2.5 mL of Columvi concentrate from the vial using a sterile needle into a second syringe. Discard any unused portion left in the vial.
-  Attach a connector to the two syringes and transfer Columvi concentrate into the syringe containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection. The final glofitamab concentration after dilution should be 0.1 mg/mL.
-  Disconnect the syringes. Draw air into the syringe containing the Columvi diluted solution and close.
-  Gently invert the syringe to mix the solution in order to avoid excessive foaming. Do not shake.
-  Remove air bubbles from the syringe before administration.

## Administration

Only administer as an intravenous infusion.

Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus.

Administer as an intravenous infusion through a dedicated infusion line using an intravenous infusion pump or syringe pump, over a maximum of 8 hours.

Once the Columvi infusion bag or syringe is empty, ensure the entire dose of Columvi is administered by clearing the infusion line with an infusion bag or syringe containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection. Continue the infusion at the same rate according to Table 2.

## Incompatibilities

Only sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) or 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection should be used to dilute Columvi, since other solvents have not been tested.

When diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, Columvi is compatible with intravenous infusion bags composed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) or polyolefin. When diluted with sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection, Columvi is compatible with intravenous infusion bags composed of PVC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

When diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) or 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection, Columvi is compatible with syringes composed of PP.

No incompatibilities have been observed with infusion sets with product-contacting surfaces of polyurethane (PUR), PVC, PE, polybutadiene (PBD), polyetherurethane (PEU), polycarbonate (PC), silicone, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and in-line filter membranes composed of polyethersulfone (PES) or polysulfone.

## 1. What Columvi is and what it is used for

## What Columvi is

Columvi is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance glofitamab.

## What Columvi is used for

Columvi is used to treat adults with a cancer called 'diffuse large B-cell lymphoma' (DLBCL). Columvi can be given alone (monotherapy) or with other medicines called chemotherapy.

-  Columvi is given alone when the cancer has come back (relapsed) or did not respond to previous treatments (refractory) and you received two or more prior therapies.
-  Columvi is given with the medicines gemcitabine and oxaliplatin when the cancer has come back (relapsed) or did not respond to previous treatments (refractory) and when you cannot receive a stem cell transplant.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a cancer of a part of your immune system (the body's defences).

-  It affects a type of white blood cell called 'B cells'.
-  In DLBCL, B cells multiply in an uncontrolled manner and build up in your tissues.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## How Columvi works

-  The active substance in Columvi, glofitamab, is a bispecific monoclonal antibody, a type of protein that attaches to two specific targets in the body. It attaches to a specific protein on the surface of B cells, including cancerous B cells, and also to another protein on the surface of T cells (another type of white blood cell). This activates T cells and causes them to multiply. This, in turn, results in the destruction of the B cells, including the cancerous cells.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Columvi

## You must not be given Columvi

-  if you are allergic to glofitamab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
-  if you are allergic to obinutuzumab, which is another medicine given before starting Columvi treatment (see also section 3 'How Columvi is given'), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine

If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Columvi.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor before you are given Columvi if

-  you have an infection
-  you have had a long-lasting infection (chronic), or an infection which keeps coming back (recurring)
-  you have or had any kidney, liver or heart problems
-  you are planning to have a vaccine in the near future

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before being given Columvi.

## Pay attention to serious side effects.

Some side effects of Columvi are serious and can be life-threatening. These may happen any time during Columvi treatment.

Tell your doctor straight away if you experience any of the following side effects while receiving Columvi. The symptoms of each side effect are listed in section 4.

-  Cytokine release syndrome: an exaggerated inflammatory condition associated with medicines that stimulate T cells, characterised by fever and impairment to multiple organs in the body. Cytokine release syndrome is more likely to occur during Cycle 1 after Columvi is given (see section 3 'How Columvi is given'). Close monitoring is needed. Before each infusion, you may be given medicines, which help reduce possible side effects of cytokine release syndrome.
-  Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome: Effects on the nervous system. Symptoms include feeling confused, disoriented, feeling less alert, having seizure or having difficulty writing and/or speaking. Close monitoring is needed.
-  Tumour lysis syndrome: some people may get unusual levels of some salts in the blood (such as potassium and uric acid) - caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells during treatment. Your doctor or nurse will do blood tests to check for this condition. Before each infusion, you should be well-hydrated and may be given medicines that can help reduce high levels of uric acid. These may help reduce possible side effects of tumour lysis syndrome.
-  Tumour flare: a reaction to certain medicines that act on the immune system which is/appears similar to worsening of the cancer.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Infections: you may get signs of infection, which can vary depending on where in the body the infection is.

If you have, or think you may have, any of the above symptoms tell your doctor straight away. Your doctor may:

-  give you other medicines to reduce symptoms and prevent complications,
-  stop your treatment for a short time, or
-  stop your treatment completely.

## Children and adolescents

This medicine should not be given to children and adolescents below 18 years of age. This is because Columvi has not been studied in this age group.

## Other medicines and Columvi

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might start taking any other medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines.

## Pregnancy and contraception

-  If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.
-  You should not be given Columvi if you are pregnant. This is because it is possible that Columvi could harm your unborn baby.
-  If you could become pregnant, you must use effective contraception while you are being treated with Columvi and for 2 months after the last dose.
-  If you become pregnant while you are being treated with Columvi tell your doctor immediately.

## Breast-feeding

Do not breast-feed while receiving Columvi and for at least 2 months after the last dose. This is because it is not known if this medicine can pass into breast milk and harm your baby.

## Driving and using machines

Columvi may influence your ability to drive, cycle or use tools or machines.

Do not drive, use tools or operate machines for at least 48 hours after each of your first two doses of Columvi or if you develop symptoms of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (such as feeling confused, disoriented, feeling less alert, having seizure or having difficulty writing and/or speaking) and/or symptoms of cytokine release syndrome (such as fever, fast heartbeat, feeling dizzy or lightheaded, chills or shortness of breath). If you currently have such symptoms, avoid these activities and contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. See section 4 for more information about side effects.

## Columvi contains polysorbates

This medicine contains 1.25 mg of polysorbate 20 in each 2.5 mL vial and 5 mg of polysorbate 20 in each 10 mL vial, which is equivalent to 0.5 mg/mL. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## 3. How Columvi is given

You will be given Columvi under the supervision of a doctor experienced in cancer treatment, in a hospital or clinic.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Medicines given before Columvi treatment

-  Seven days before starting Columvi treatment , you will be given another medicine, obinutuzumab, to reduce the number of B cells in your blood.
-  30 to 60 minutes before you are given Columvi , you may be given other medicines (premedication) to help reduce reactions associated with cytokine release syndrome. These medicines may include:
- -A corticosteroid such as dexamethasone
- -A fever-reducing medicine such as paracetamol
- -An antihistamine such as diphenhydramine

## How much and how often you will receive Columvi

You may be given up to 12 treatment cycles of Columvi. Each cycle lasts 21 days. During the first two cycles, your doctor will begin Columvi treatment with a low dose and will gradually increase it to the full dose.

A typical schedule is shown below.

Cycle 1: This will include a pre-treatment and 2 low doses of Columvi during the 21 days:

-  Day 1 - Pre-treatment with obinutuzumab
-  Day 8 - 2.5 mg starting dose of Columvi
-  Day 15 - 10 mg intermediate dose of Columvi

Cycle 2 to Cycle 12: This will be just one dose in the 21 days:

-  Day 1 - 30 mg full dose of Columvi

## How Columvi is given and monitoring

Columvi is given as a drip into a vein (an intravenous infusion). Your doctor will monitor you during all Columvi infusions and adjust the time required for infusion depending on how you respond to treatment.

-  Your first infusion will be given over 4 hours. When Columvi is given alone, your doctor will monitor you carefully during the first infusion and for 10 hours after completion of infusion. When Columvi is given with the medicines gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, your doctor will monitor you carefully during the first infusion and for 4 hours after completion of infusion. This is to watch for any signs or symptoms of cytokine release syndrome.
-  For following infusions, your doctor may require to monitor you after completion of infusion. This will be necessary if you have had moderate or severe cytokine release syndrome with your previous dose.
-  If you do not have any cytokine release syndrome after 3 doses, your doctor may give the following infusions over 2 hours.

## If you miss a dose of Columvi

If you miss an appointment, make another one straight away. For the treatment to be fully effective, it is very important not to miss a dose.

## Before stopping Columvi treatment

Speak with your doctor before stopping treatment. This is because stopping treatment may make your condition worse.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

Preparation of intravenous syringe infusion (2.5 mg dose only)

Use a two-syringe method with a connector to prepare the dose. The final volume of the diluted solution is 25 mL.

-  Withdraw 22.5 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection from an infusion bag into a syringe of the appropriate size (e.g., 30 mL).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Withdraw 2.5 mL of Columvi concentrate from the vial using a sterile needle into a second syringe. Discard any unused portion left in the vial.
-  Attach a connector to the two syringes and transfer Columvi concentrate into the syringe containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection. The final glofitamab concentration after dilution should be 0.1 mg/mL.
-  Disconnect the syringes. Draw air into the syringe containing the Columvi diluted solution and close.
-  Gently invert the syringe to mix the solution in order to avoid excessive foaming. Do not shake.
-  Remove air bubbles from the syringe before administration.

## Administration

Only administer as an intravenous infusion.

Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus.

Administer as an intravenous infusion through a dedicated infusion line using an intravenous infusion pump or syringe pump, over a maximum of 8 hours.

Once the Columvi infusion bag or syringe is empty, ensure the entire dose of Columvi is administered by clearing the infusion line with an infusion bag or syringe containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection. Continue the infusion at the same rate.

## Incompatibilities

Only sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) or 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection should be used to dilute Columvi, since other solvents have not been tested.

When diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, Columvi is compatible with intravenous infusion bags composed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) or polyolefin. When diluted with sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection, Columvi is compatible with intravenous infusion bags composed of PVC.

When diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) or 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection, Columvi is compatible with syringes composed of PP.

No incompatibilities have been observed with infusion sets with product-contacting surfaces of polyurethane (PUR), PVC, PE, polybutadiene (PBD), polyetherurethane (PEU), polycarbonate (PC), silicone, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and in-line filter membranes composed of polyethersulfone (PES) or polysulfone. The use of in-line filter membranes is optional.

## Diluted solution for intravenous infusion

Chemical and physical in-use stability have been demonstrated for a maximum of 72 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C and 24 hours at 30 °C followed by a maximum infusion time of 8 hours.

From a microbiological point of view, the diluted solution should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.

## Disposal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Columvi vial is for single use only.

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
