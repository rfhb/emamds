In view of available data about the use of bupivacaine / meloxicam during lactation, based on the results of study HTX-011-220 (showing that bupivacaine / meloxicam is excreted in breastmilk for 6-8 days), and information about use during pregnancy, based on the PRAC advice for NSAID-containing medicinal products (EMA/CMDh/642745/2022), the PRAC considers that the product information should be strengthened accordingly. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) On the basis of the scientific conclusions for bupivacaine/meloxicam the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing bupivacaine/meloxicam is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
