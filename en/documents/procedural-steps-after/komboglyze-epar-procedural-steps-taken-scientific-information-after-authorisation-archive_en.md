The secondary endpoint, all-cause mortality, occurred at a rate of 5.1% in the saxagliptin group and 4.6% in the placebo group. CV deaths were balanced across the treatment groups. There was a numerical imbalance in non-CV death, with more events on saxagliptin (1.8%) than placebo (1.4%) [HR = 1.27; (95% CI 1.00, 1.62); P = 0.051]. |

Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to implement QRD version 9 for Komboglyze and to update the list of local representatives and to perform minor editorial corrections throughout both PIs.

Therefore, caution is warranted in these patients. In the SAVOR trial a small increase in the rate for hospitalisation for heart failure was observed in the saxagliptin treated patients compared to placebo (see section 5.1). Additional analysis did not indicate a differential effect among NYHA classes. In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its major metabolite did not inhibit CYP2C8. SAVOR was a cardiovascular outcome study conducted in 16,492 patients with type II diabetes who had a history of, or were at risk for, cardiovascular events. Its results demonstrated that saxagliptin is non-inferior to placebo and does not induce an increased risk for cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal ischaemic stroke. GENERATION was a 52-week trial performed in 720 elderly patients. The purpose was to evaluate whether saxagliptin + Metformin was superior to glimepiride + metformin on the primary endpoint of subjects reaching HbA1c < 7% without hypoglycaemia (confirmed or severe). There appeared to be no difference in responders. Glimepiride was more effective than saxagliptin in reducing HbA1c, but at the cost of more hypoglycaemia. Saxagliptin was less effective, but can still reduce HbA1c to some extent, and did not induce hypoglycaemia. Age appeared to be an important factor: results favoured saxagliptin in subjects <   |
