Furthermore, minor typographical changes have been introduced to SPC section 4.4.

There are no concrete data to support the contraindication of use of AIIRAs during breast-feeding. All AIIRA agents were found in the milk of lactating rats but no human data about their transfer into breast milk are available. There is only a theoretical presumption of low transport according to their high plasma protein binding and low oral availability. A harmonised wording recommending an alternative treatment with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant, has been included in the section 4.6 of the SPC and section 2 of the PL. Consequently, the existing contraindication for lactation has been |

| II/0013         | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet The MAHapplied for an update of the SPC sections 4.3, 4.4, and 4.6 as well as PL section 2 to implement the CHMP recommendation on a harmonised labelling relating to the use of ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists during pregnancy. | 24/04/2008          | 10/06/2008 product                       | SPC, PL no longer                | Cooper's study published in the NEJM in June 2006 identified a signal of increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly cardiac defects after exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy. Since the role of confounding factors such as diabetes and hypertension cannot be accurately defined based on the available data, the teratogenic potential of ACE inhibitors is not demonstrated, even though data suggest that such exposure cannot be considered as safe and should be avoided. There are fewer data regarding the risks associated with first trimester exposure to Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) than for ACE inhibitors. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that the risk is lower for AIIRAs, and it is considered that any conclusions on ACE inhibitors are also valid for AIIRAs. Therefore, the existing contraindication for the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy remained, but a harmonised wording regarding pregnancy across the class was introduced. authorised |
