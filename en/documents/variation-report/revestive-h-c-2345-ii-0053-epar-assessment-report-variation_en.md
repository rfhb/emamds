## 1. Background information on the procedure

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Shire Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 24 March 2021 an application for a variation.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                               | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                 | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to update the Product information with results from two studies included in the paediatric investigation plan (PIP). Study SHP633-301 was performed to evaluate the safety, efficacy/pharmacodynamics (PD), and pharmacokinetics (PK) of teduglutide in infants 4 to 12 months gestational age with SBS and who are dependent on parenteral support. The second study is a paediatric population PK model including data from study SHP633-301. The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make editorial changes to section 4.5 of the SmPC.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

This variation proposed changes to Product information, updating SmPC sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 to include results from two paediatric studies with 'Revestive 1.25 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection'. In addition, editorial changes were made to section 4.5 of SmPC.

SHP633-301 was a randomized, open-label study, conducted in 10 paediatric subjects from 4 to 12 months of gestational age with short bowel syndrome (SBS) dependent on parenteral support (PS) to evaluate safety, efficacy/pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of teduglutide. The study consisted of a 2- to 4-week screening period, a 24-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period. Randomization was stratified according to the presence of a small bowel ostomy. During the 24-week treatment period, subjects in the SOC arm (n=5) received standard medical therapy for SBS while those in the teduglutide (TED) arm (n=5) received 0.05 mg/kg/day subcutaneously in addition to standard medical therapy.

Based on subject diary data for the 3 individuals in the TED arm that completed the study, a reduction in the PS volume was reported, with a mean change in PS volume at end of treatment (EOT) from baseline of -21.5±28.91 mL/kg/day, corresponding to a mean percentage change of -24.8±34.72%. Furthermore, a mean reduction in PS caloric intake (-27.0±29.47%), daily infusion time (-28.9±30.61%) and number of days per week in PS usage (-28.5±30.05%) was observed at EOT from baseline. No subject achieved enteral autonomy.

Adverse events reported in the study were consistent with the safety profile seen in the previous paediatric studies and no new safety issues were identified. Overall, there were a total of 87 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in 10 (100%) subjects. TEAEs were mostly mild in severity and deemed not related to study drug by the investigators. No TESAEs were deemed related to study drug by the investigator. There were no TEAEs leading to death. There were no AESIs (events of polyps of the colon, benign neoplasia of the gastrointestinal tract, or tumor-promoting ability) reported during the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Changes in body weight, length, and weight/length ratio Z-scores were within the expected range for the subjects' age group and comparable between the teduglutide treatment arm and the SOC arm. Head circumference Z-scores observed in the SOC arm seemed to drop further over time compared with the teduglutide treatment arm.

In order to justify dosing in the paediatric population, population pharmacokinetics (PK), PK/PD modelling and simulation of teduglutide were conducted based on data from 18 clinical studies, including Study SHP633-301. The relationship between teduglutide exposure (Cmax and AUC) and PS volume was evaluated using a time and exposure-response model. The analysis included a total of 251 subjects with SBS with both exposure and values of prescribed PS volume at both baseline and the end of each study. The population included 5 subjects from 4 months to &lt;1 year with a total of 19 PK samples collected via a sparse sample collection approach. The MAH states that Cmax similarity was observed across age groups supporting 0.05 mg daily dosing in paediatric subjects who are 4 months to less than 1 year of age. The mean CL/F values in subjects with moderate, severe renal impairment, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were approximately 32%, 44%, and 57% lower than those in subjects with normal renal function, respectively. Based on the above results, a 50% dosage reduction is recommended in paediatric patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and ESRD as adult patients with same degrees of renal impairment.

The exposure-safety analysis results showed a statistically significant relationship between steady state teduglutide exposure Cmax or AUC versus nausea or abdominal pain.

There is no change in the indication and Revestive remain indicated from 1 year of age.

CHMP agrees that current data do not support a recommendation on posology nor indication for children below 1 year of age. This has been implemented in section 4.2 of SmPC. Section 5.1 and 5.2 have been amended to briefly describe results of study SHP633-301.

The benefit-risk balance of Revestive, remains positive in the current indication.

## Scope

Please refer to the Recommendations section above

## Summary

Please refer to Scientific Discussion 'Revestive-H-C-002345-II-0053'

In a completed clinical trial (SHP633-301) in paediatric subjects aged 4 to 12 months corrected gestational age with short bowel syndrome (SBS) dependent on parenteral support (PS), a total of 10 subjects were randomized to the teduglutide arm (n=5) and Standard of Care arm (SOC, n=5), of which 8 subjects completed the study. Overall, results showed a relatively higher number of subjects achieving clinically meaningful reductions in PS nutrition volume, caloric intake and a higher percentage of the average reductions in PS calories, daily infusion time an number of days per week in PS usage within the teduglutide arm than the SOC arm. No subject achieved enteral autonomy during the study. Adverse events reported in the study were consistent with the safety profile seen in the previous paediatric studies and no new safety issues were identified.

Population pharmacokinetics (PK) and PK/PD modelling and simulation of teduglutide demonstrated Cmax similarity across age groups (4 months to 17 years) supporting 0.05 mg daily dosing in pediatric subjects who are 4 months to less than 1 year of age. A 50% dosage reduction is recommended in paediatric patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease (ESRD) as adult patients with same degrees of renal impairment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Currently available data in children below 1 year are described in section 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be made. Long-term safety data are not yet available for the paediatric population.

## Annex: Rapporteur's assessment comments on the type II variation

## 5. Introduction

Teduglutide (rDNA origin) is an analog of naturally occurring human glucagon-like peptide-2, a peptide secreted by L-cells of the distal intestine. Teduglutide under the trade name Revestive ®  first received marketing authorization in the European Union via centralized procedure for the treatment of short bowel syndrome (SBS) on 30 Aug 2012. On 29 Jun 2016, the European Commission granted an extension of the Market Authorization for teduglutide (Revestive) for the treatment of patients aged 1 year and above with SBS.

The MAH proposes to update the Summary of Clinical Pharmacology with the results of

- The pharmacokinetics (PK) results of Study SHP633-301, a randomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety, efficacy/pharmacodynamics (PD), and PK of teduglutide in infants 4 to 12 months corrected gestational age (a premature baby's chronological age minus the number of weeks or months he/she was born early) with SBS who are dependent on parenteral support (PS).
- A population PK analysis of teduglutide based on data from 18 clinical studies including the recently completed Phase 3 Study SHP633-301 in pediatric subjects 4 months to &lt;1 year corrected gestational age (SHIR-CSC-129\\_PKglobal).
- An exposure-response analysis (SHIR-CSC-129\\_ERglobal) to assess the relationship between
- o teduglutide exposure and the change from baseline in PS volume in pediatric subjects (4 months and older) with SBS.
- o teduglutide exposure and safety endpoints of interest (ie, vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhea) in subjects (4 months and older) with SBS

## 6. Clinical Pharmacology aspects

## 6.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

## Study SHP633-301

SHP633-301 was a randomized, open-label study consisting of a 2- to 4-week screening period, a 24 week treatment period, and 4-week follow-up period. All subjects were screened prior to start of treatment to verify the requirements for nutritional support for each subject and to ensure adherence to eligibility parameters. Subjects were randomized (1:1 ratio) to the teduglutide or standard of care (SOC) treatment arm. Randomization was stratified according to the presence of a small bowel ostomy (eg, end jejunostomy or ileostomy). During the 24-week treatment period, subjects in the SOC arm received standard medical therapy for SBS while those in the teduglutide arm received 0.05 mg/kg/day subcutaneously in addition to standard medical therapy. At each site visit during the treatment phase, efficacy (adjustments to PS) and safety were monitored.

Sparse blood samples for PK analysis were collected in subjects enrolled in the teduglutide arm at predose, and 1 hour (±10 minutes) and 4 hours (±10 minutes) postdose at baseline (Visit 0). Samples were also collected 2 hours (±10 minutes) postdose at Week 7 (Visit 7) or Week 12 (Visit 12) of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment period. Originally, there was an option to collect postbaseline PK samples at Week 7 or Week 12; however, this option was removed in protocol Amendment 4 and thereafter all postbaseline PK samples were to be collected at Week 7.

At the end of the treatment period (Week 24/EOT), all subjects entered a 4-week follow-up period until the end of study (Week 28) during which time subjects received standard medical therapy, but no investigational product was administered. At the end of the treatment period, some subjects who completed the study had the opportunity to participate in a long-term extension study, SHP633 304, in which eligible subjects would continue to receive teduglutide. The follow-up period for subjects in the teduglutide treatment arm may have been truncated and the subjects could have proceeded immediately to the end of study visit if at least 1 'escape' criteria was met.

## Assessor´s comments

SHP633-301 was a randomized, open-label study consisting of a 2- to 4-week screening period, a 24 week treatment period, and 4-week follow-up period. Randomization was stratified according to the presence of a small bowel ostomy (e.g., end jejunostomy or ileostomy). During the 24-week treatment period, subjects in the SOC arm received standard medical therapy for SBS while those in the teduglutide arm received 0.05 mg/kg/day subcutaneously in addition to standard medical therapy.

Sparse blood samples for PK analysis were collected in subjects enrolled in the teduglutide arm at predose, and 1 hour and 4 hours postdose at baseline (Visit 0). Samples were also collected 2 hours postdose at Week 7 (Visit 7) or Week 12 (Visit 12) of the treatment period. Originally, there was an option to collect postbaseline PK samples at Week 7 or Week 12; however, this option was removed in protocol Amendment 4 and thereafter all postbaseline PK samples were to be collected at Week 7.

The MAH is asked to present the number of plasma samples collected and used for analysis in study SHP633-301 (OC) .

At the end of the treatment period, some subjects who completed the study had the opportunity to participate in a long-term extension study, SHP633 304, in which eligible subjects would continue to receive teduglutide.

## 6.2. Results

A total of 10 subjects were randomized in the study, 5 subjects in each treatment arm and analyzed for safety and efficacy/PD.

Eight subjects completed the study. Two subjects discontinued from the study: 1 subject in the teduglutide arm met escape criteria during the follow-up period and 1 subject in the SOC arm discontinued early from the study during the treatment period. In addition, 1 subject interrupted teduglutide treatment following the parents' decision to stop teduglutide administration as they thought several adverse events were caused by the study drug; teduglutide treatment never resumed and the subject completed the study.

The PK set contains all subjects who received at least 1 dose of teduglutide and had at least 1 evaluable and interpretable postdose PK concentration value. All 5 subjects randomized in the teduglutide arm were included in the PK set; 1 subject missed the Week 7 postdose sample collection due to the COVID 19 pandemic. The mean ±standard deviation (SD) teduglutide plasma concentrations over time are presented in the SHP633-301 clinical study report (CSR) Section 14, Figure 14.2.3.18 in both linear and semi-log scales.

The exposure to teduglutide, as presented by serum teduglutide concentrations measured in the samples collected at different times post once daily subcutaneous (SC) administration and at different

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

days over the treatment period, was demonstrated over the study duration in infant subjects receiving teduglutide.

The summary of mean, median, minimum, and maximum teduglutide plasma concentrations by timepoint is presented in Table 1. The median postdose teduglutide plasma concentrations were 16.30 ng/mL at 1 hour, 16.95 ng/mL and 25.65 ng/mL at 2 hours (Week 7 and Week 12 visits, respectively), and 8.39 ng/mL at 4 hours. The minimum and maximum postdose teduglutide plasma concentrations were 2.21 ng/mL and 29.00 ng/mL over the sample collection time during the treatment, respectively.

## Comparison and Analyses of Results Across Studies

Further population PK and PK/PD modeling and simulation to support Type II submission for pediatrics 4 months to &lt;1 year were conducted including data from Study SHP633-301, following the Japanese submission for adult and pediatric patients with SBS. A total of 7 pediatrics subjects 4 months to &lt;1 year of age with SBS who are dependent on PS are included, 5 subjects from Study SHP633-301 and 2 subjects from Study SHP633-302.

## Pharmacokinetics in PS-dependent Pediatric Subjects with SBS

Results from a population PK analysis of teduglutide is presented using data from 18 clinical trials, including data of 101 pediatric subjects 4 months and older collected in studies TED-C13-003, TED-C14-006, SHP633-302, and SHP633-301.

## Methodology

The population PK modeling analysis included a total of 7 pediatric subjects 4 months to &lt;1 year of age, 5 subjects from Study SHP633-301 and 2 subjects from Study SHP633-302; this PK information was available after the completion of study SHP633-301. Overall, a total of 480 subjects were included in the population PK analysis. The PK population included a total of 101 pediatric and 379 adult subjects. The population consisted of 304 (63.3%) male and 176 (36.7%) female subjects. Most subjects were of white origin (81.5%). The population included a total of 7 pediatric subjects from 4 months to &lt;1 year, 86 pediatric subjects 1 to &lt;12 years, 8 pediatric subjects 12 to &lt;18 years, and 379 adult subjects (≥18 years). A total of 349 (72.7%) subjects had normal renal function. A total of 78 (16.2%), 40 (8.3%), and 7 (1.5%) subjects presented mild, moderate, severe renal impairment, respectively. A total of 6 (1.2%) subjects were at end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

A one-compartment disposition model with a first-order rate constant of absorption (Ka) and lag time (ALAG) was previously used to describe the concentration-time profiles of teduglutide based on data collected in 478 subjects (18 clinical studies). The population PK model included allometric functions accounting for the effect of body weight on PK parameters (Ka, apparent clearance [CL/F], and apparent central volume of distribution [Vc/F]). The above population PK model was updated by including pediatric subjects 4 months to &lt;1 year with SBS enrolled in Studies SHP633-301 and SHP633-302. In addition, source of variability on PK parameters of teduglutide, including intrinsic factors (body weight, age, renal function, race, sex, and disease status) and extrinsic factors (dose, formulation strength, and site injection) were performed to improve the population PK model. The model evaluation was based on standard model diagnostics and goodness-of-fit criteria and by looking

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

at pertinent graphical representations of goodness-of-fit. Finally, the simulation was performed to estimate the PK parameters using the final population PK model and the PK parameters were summarized for pediatric (across age groups) and adult subjects with SBS (SHIR-CSC-129\\_PKglobal).

## Results

Population PK parameters of teduglutide derived with the final model (run009) are presented. Body weight, age, baseline creatinine clearance (CrCL), injection site, and disease status were identified as significant covariates affecting PK parameters including CL/F, Vc/F, and Ka. Sensitivity analyses did not show any differences in population PK model improvement between with and without including the kidney maturation. Overall, data collected in pediatric subjects 4 months to &lt;1 year did not impact the population PK estimates as compared with the previous population PK for the Japanese submission.

Mean and median Cmax,ss values of teduglutide in pediatric subjects with SBS across age groups (mean range: 28.5 ng/mL to 43.0 ng/mL and median range: 26.7 ng/mL to 37.4 ng/mL) were consistent with that observed in adult subjects with SBS (mean: 39.6 ng/mL) when receiving 0.05 mg/kg daily. Moreover, the range of individual Cmax,ss values of teduglutide in pediatric subjects with SBS across age groups (20.7 to 84.9 ng/mL) was similar to that observed in adult subjects with SBS (19.5 ng/mL to 75.3 ng/mL). In addition, mean t1/2 values of teduglutide in pediatric subjects with SBS across age groups (mean range: 0.813 h to 1.17 h) were consistent with that observed in adult subjects with SBS (mean: 1.22 h).

Mean AUCss values were age-dependent and gradually decreased with age from a mean of 223 ng·h/mL in adults to 78.6 ng·h/mL in pediatric subjects 4 months to &lt;1 year when receiving 0.05 mg/kg teduglutide daily.

It is to be noted that a 87% decrease in body weight (from 57.9 kg in adults to 7.51 kg in the 4 months to &lt;1 year) resulted in a 65% decrease in AUCss (from 223 ng·h/mL in adults to 78.6 ng·h/mL in the 4 months to &lt;1 year).

Overall, results confirmed that pediatric patients 4 months to &lt;18 years are expected to present similar Cmax,ss values of teduglutide as observed in adults. On the other hand, the AUCss of teduglutide was age-dependent and gradually decreased from adults to pediatric subjects between 4 months and &lt;1 year of age. Clinical PS response data in conjunction with Cmax,ss were demonstrated to support

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

teduglutide dose selection since AUCss was previously shown not to correlate with efficacy. Thus, as a response marker, Cmax of teduglutide has been targeted across age populations. The current analyses have confirmed similarity of Cmax of teduglutide across age populations including pediatrics subjects 4 month to &lt;1 year of age with SBS, therefore, supporting 0.05 mg/kg daily in this age group patients.

## Assessor´s comments

Body weight, age, baseline creatinine clearance (CrCL), injection site, and disease status were identified as significant covariates affecting PK parameters including CL/F, Vc/F, and Ka. Sensitivity analyses did not show any differences in population PK model improvement between with and without including the kidney maturation. Overall, data collected in pediatric subjects 4 months to &lt;1 year did not impact the population PK estimates as compared with the previous population PK for the Japanese submission.

Overall, the MAH considers that pediatric patients 4 months to &lt;18 years are expected to present similar Cmax,ss values of teduglutide as observed in adults. However, the AUCss of teduglutide was agedependent and gradually decreased from adults to pediatric subjects between 4 months and &lt;1 year of age. The Applicant states that Cmax of teduglutide has been targeted across age populations, and that the current analyses have confirmed similarity of Cmax of teduglutide across age populations including pediatrics subjects 4 month to &lt;1 year of age with SBS, therefore, supporting 0.05 mg/kg daily in this age group patients.

As per the population PK model, the CL/F of teduglutide was dependent on CrCL and body weight. The mean body weight adjusted CL/F in pediatric subjects with mild renal impairment was approximately 25% lower than that observed in subjects with normal renal function. The lower body weight adjusted CL/F in pediatric subjects with mild renal impairment resulted in a 17% higher AUCss relative to those with normal renal function (139 ng·h/mL vs 119 ng·h/mL, respectively).

The mean body weight adjusted Vc/F values in pediatric subjects with mild renal impairment was 32% lower than that observed in subjects with normal renal function. The lower Vc/F in pediatric subjects with mild renal impairment resulted in a 49% higher Cmax,ss relative to those with normal renal function (49.7 ng/mL vs 33.3 ng/mL, respectively), but the minimum and maximum Cmax values in pediatric subjects with mild renal impairment were retained within the range of Cmax values observed in pediatric subjects with normal renal function.

The above increases in AUCss and Cmax,ss were not deemed clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended in pediatric subjects with mild renal impairment.

Overall, the above results are consistent with those observed in adult subjects with SBS, whereby slightly lower CL/F and Vc/F in subjects with mild renal impairment did not result in a clinically relevant increase on the AUCss and Cmax,ss of teduglutide relative to subjects with normal renal function. Based on a dedicated study (Study CL0600-018) in non-SBS subjects with renal impairment, the mean CL/F values in subjects with moderate, severe renal impairment, and ESRD were approximately 32%, 44%, and 57% lower than those in subjects with normal renal function, respectively. Based on the above results, a 50% dosage reduction is recommended in pediatric patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and ESRD as adult patients with same degrees of renal impairment (refer to SHIR-CSC-129\\_PKglobal, Appendix 5, Section 15.1 and Section 15.4).

(49.7 ng/mL vs 33.3 ng/mL, respectively), but the minimum and maximum Cmax values in pediatric subjects with mild renal impairment were retained within the range of Cmax values observed in pediatric subjects with normal renal function.

The MAH states that the observed increases in AUCss and Cmax,ss were not deemed clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended in pediatric subjects with mild renal impairment.

The mean CL/F values in subjects with moderate, severe renal impairment, and ESRD were approximately 32%, 44%, and 57% lower than those in subjects with normal renal function, respectively.

## Immunogenicity Effect

To assess the effect on PK further, anti-drug antibodies (ADA) status was tested in the population PK analyses, as one of covariates, based on data from 3 studies including both adult and pediatric subjects with SBS (according to data availability) (SHIR-CSC-129-Japanese, Population PK Analysis). The results showed that the ADA incidence was small and did not have an impact on PK of teduglutide. Since the updated dataset included only one new concentration in a subject with ADA positive, ADA was not retested in the current analysis.

## PK/PD Relationship in PS-dependent Pediatric Subjects with SBS

This section presents results from an exposure-response modelling analyses developed to assess the relationship between

- teduglutide exposure and the change from baseline in PS volume in pediatric subjects (4 months and older) with SBS
- teduglutide exposure and safety endpoints of interest (ie, vomiting; abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhea) in subjects (4 months and older) with SBS.

This exposure-response analysis of teduglutide used data from 10 clinical trials, including data of 101 pediatric subjects 4 months and older collected in Studies TED-C13-003, TED-C14-006, SHP633302, and SHP633-301. A brief description of each of the 10 clinical studies is provided in SHIR-CSC-129\\_ERglobal, Appendix 1, Section 11.1 and Section 11.2).

## Parenteral Support

The relationship between teduglutide exposure (Cmax and AUC) and PS volume was evaluated using a time and exposure-response model. Efficacy (PS volume) datasets were from Studies CL0600-004, CL0600-020, CL0600-021, TED-C13-003, TED-C14-004, TED-C14-006, SHP633-301, SHP-633-302, SHP-633-306, and SHP-633-307.

The current analysis therefore included a total of 251 subjects with SBS with both exposure and values of prescribed PS volume at both baseline and the end of each study. The population included a total of 7 pediatric subjects from 4 months to &lt;1 year, 86 pediatric subjects 1 to &lt;12 years, 8 pediatric subjects 12 to &lt;18 years, and 150 adult subjects. The median body weight (range) and age (range) were 48.8 kg (5.26 kg to 87.9 kg) and 35.0 years (0.380 year to 87.9 years), respectively. Descriptive statistics of subjects included in the exposure-response analysis of efficacy is presented in SHIR-CSC-129\\_ERglobal, Section 8.3.

Individual change from baseline prescribed PS volumes in pediatric subjects as a function of dose are presented. Studies SHP633-301, SHP633-302, TED-C13-003, TED-C14-004, and TED-C14-006 in pediatric subjects were performed up to 112 and 196 days (Week 28) of dosing.

Various time- and exposure-response models were developed to optimally assess the change from baseline diary PS volume over time. An overview of all models developed for model discrimination is presented in SHIR-CSC-129\\_ERglobal, Appendix 4, Section 14.5. In a first step, longitudinal data from studies performed over 2 years of more (i.e., CL0600-021 and SHP633-307) were modelled to assess the effect of time.

Based on the above model, the estimated time to 50% of the maximum effect (ET50) was approximately 168 days. The above results suggest that only 50% of the maximum effect is observed at Week 24 (168 days). In a second step, the ET50 was fixed to 168 days, and the effect of teduglutide AUC and Cmax were evaluated. The model with Cmax (estimated with an exponent in a power model) was associated with a better goodness-of-fit relative to a model with AUC. The time- and exposureresponse model based on the Cmax of teduglutide is described in SHIR-CSC-129\\_ERglobal, Table 6.

Descriptive statistics of PK and PD parameters (change from baseline prescribed PS volume) in pediatric and adult subjects who received the 0.05 mg/kg teduglutide dosing regimen are presented. The median baseline prescribed PS volume in pediatric and adult subjects were 6.88 L/Week and 10.4 L/Week, respectively.

At Week 24, pediatric and adult subjects presented a median change from baseline of -1.83 L/Week and -2.40 L/Week of prescribed PS volume, respectively. The above changes at Week 24 corresponded to a median percent change from baseline of -27% and -23% in pediatric and adult subjects, respectively.

At steady state, pediatric and adult subjects presented a median maximum change from baseline of -3.67 L/Week and -4.80 L/Week of prescribed PS volume, respectively. The above changes at steady state corresponded to a median percent change from baseline of -53% and -46% in pediatric and adult subjects, respectively.

## Assessor´s comments

The relationship between teduglutide exposure (Cmax and AUC) and PS volume was evaluated using a time and exposure-response model. Efficacy (PS volume) datasets were from Studies CL0600-004, CL0600-020, CL0600-021, TED-C13-003, TED-C14-004, TED-C14-006, SHP633-301, SHP-633-302, SHP-633-306, and SHP-633-307.

The current analysis therefore included a total of 251 subjects with SBS with both exposure and values of prescribed PS volume at both baseline and the end of each study. The population included a total of 7 pediatric subjects from 4 months to &lt;1 year, 86 pediatric subjects 1 to &lt;12 years, 8 pediatric

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects 12 to &lt;18 years, and 150 adult subjects. The median body weight (range) and age (range) were 48.8 kg (5.26 kg to 87.9 kg) and 35.0 years (0.380 year to 87.9 years), respectively.

Based on the above model, the estimated time to 50% of the maximum effect (ET50) was approximately Week 24 (168 days). In a second step, the ET50 was fixed to 168 days, and the effect of teduglutide AUC and Cmax were evaluated.

The median baseline PS volume in the 4 months to &lt;1 year, 1 to &lt;6 years, 6 to &lt;12 years, and 12 to 17 years age groups were 3.61 L/Week, 6.68 L/Week, 6.88 L/Week, and 11.7 L/Week, respectively.

At Week 24, the median change from baseline PS volume in the 4 months to &lt;1 year, 1 to &lt;6 years, 6 to &lt;12 years, and 12 to 17 years age groups were -0.620 L/Week, -1.01 L/Week, -2.88 L/Week, and -4.31 L/Week, respectively. These above changes at Week 24 corresponded to median percent change from baseline of -17%, -15%, -42% and -37%, respectively.

At steady state, the median maximum change from baseline PS volume in the 4 months to &lt;1 year, 1 to &lt;6 years, 6 to &lt;12 years, and 12 to 17 years age groups were -1.24 L/Week, -2.02 L/Week, -5.76 L/Week, and -8.63 L/Week, respectively. These above changes at steady state corresponded to a median percent change from baseline of -34%, -30%, -84% and -74%, respectively.

## Safety (Vomiting, Diarrhea, Nausea, Abdominal Pain)

An exposure-response analysis was performed to assess the relationship between teduglutide exposure and the probability of the most frequent treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) in subjects with SBS. Safety (adverse events) included datasets from Studies CL0600-004, CL0600-020, CL0600-021, TED-C13-003, TED-C14-004, TED-C14-006, SHP633-301, SHP-633-302, SHP-633-306, and SHP-633307.

A total of 234 subjects with SBS were included in the analysis. Of which 53 (22.6%) presented at least one instance of vomiting, 28 (12.0%) presented at least one instance of diarrhea, 37 (15.8%) presented at least one instance of nausea, and 59 (25.2%) presented at least one instance of abdominal pain. The relationship between teduglutide exposure and the probability of the above TEAE was assessed. Descriptive statistics on the number of subjects by study are presented in SHIR-CSC-129\\_ERglobal, Section 8.4.

## Probability of Vomiting

The probability of vomiting as a function of teduglutide exposure parameters at steady state (Cmax and AUC) are presented. No exposure-response relationship was observed since the probability of vomiting did not significantly increase with higher Cmax and AUC values (Wald test p-value &gt;0.05).

## Probability of Nausea

The probability of nausea as a function of teduglutide exposure parameters at steady state (Cmax and AUC) are presented. A statistically significant exposure-response relationship was observed since the probability of nausea increased significantly with higher Cmax and AUC values (Wald test p-value &lt;0.05). The exposure-response model based on Cmax was associated with better goodness-of-fit (i.e., lower Akaike Criteria [AIC]) relative to the AUC model (202.7 and 204.0, respectively).

## Special Studies

Not applicable.

## Discussion

Further population PK and PK/PD modeling and simulation were conducted to support the proposed type II variation in pediatrics 4 months to &lt;1 year A total of 7 pediatrics subjects 4 months to &lt;1 year of age with SBS who are dependent on PS are included.

The PK population included a total of 101 pediatric and 379 adult subjects. The population included a total of 7 pediatric subjects from 4 months to &lt;1 year, 86 pediatric subjects 1 to &lt;12 years, 8 pediatric subjects 12 to &lt;18 years, and 379 adult subjects (≥18 years)

Body weight, age, baseline creatinine clearance (CrCL), injection site, and disease status were identified as significant covariates affecting PK parameters including CL/F, Vc/F, and Ka. Sensitivity analyses did not show any differences in population PK model improvement between with and without including the kidney maturation. Overall, data collected in pediatric subjects 4 months to &lt;1 year did not impact the population PK estimates as compared with the previous population PK for the Japanese submission.

Overall, the MAH considers that pediatric patients 4 months to &lt;18 years are expected to present similar Cmax,ss values of teduglutide as observed in adults. However, the AUCss of teduglutide was agedependent and gradually decreased from adults to pediatric subjects between 4 months and &lt;1 year of age. The Applicant states that Cmax of teduglutide has been targeted across age populations, and that the current analyses have confirmed similarity of Cmax of teduglutide across age populations including pediatrics subjects 4 month to &lt;1 year of age with SBS, therefore, supporting 0.05 mg/kg daily in this age group patients.

An exposure-response analysis was performed to assess the relationship between teduglutide exposure and the probability of the most frequent treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) in subjects with SBS. A total of 234 subjects with SBS were included in the analysis. A statistically significant exposureresponse relationship was observed on the probability of vomiting and abdominal pain since the probability of nausea increased significantly with higher Cmax and AUC values (Wald test p-value &lt;0.05). No exposure-response relationship was observed on the probability of vomiting or diarrhea, since the probability did not significantly increase with higher Cmax and AUC values (Wald test p-value &gt;0.05).

The MAH is asked to discuss the clinical significance of the presented exposure-safety results in regards of nausea and abdominal pain, which should include instructions for prescribing physician e.g.

## 7. Clinical Efficacy aspects

## 7.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

## Study SHP633-301

SHP633-301 was a randomized, open-label study consisting of a 2- to 4-week screening period, a 24 week treatment period, and 4-week follow-up period. All subjects were screened prior to start of treatment to verify the requirements for nutritional support for each subject and to ensure adherence to eligibility parameters. Subjects had to be receiving at least 50% of fluid or calories parenterally and have stable PS requirements for at least 1 month prior to screening and weigh at least 5 kg with a weight for length Z-score greater than -2 at screening and baseline. Subjects were randomized (1:1 ratio) to the teduglutide or standard of care (SOC) treatment arm at the baseline visit (Week 0). Randomization was stratified according to the presence of a small bowel ostomy (e.g., end jejunostomy or ileostomy). During the 24-week treatment period, subjects in the SOC arm received standard medical therapy for SBS while those in the teduglutide arm received 0.05 mg/kg/day subcutaneously in addition to standard medical therapy.

Subjects in both arms followed the same visit schedule and assessments. Subjects were monitored weekly with phone or clinic visits. Clinic visits occurred at Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28. At all site visits and telephone contacts, safety was monitored and nutritional support was reviewed and adjusted as needed. To maintain consistency across centers, guidance and training were provided to help sites follow the nutritional support adjustment guidelines (developed with SBS expert input and provided in the protocol) related to decisions for PS reduction and advances in enteral feeds based on weight gain, urine and stool output, and clinical stability. Deviations from the guidelines were not considered a protocol deviation.

Blood samples for native GLP-2 measurements were collected at the screening and at end of the treatment (EOT) visits. Native GLP-2 may not have been collected in some subjects if blood volumes were limiting based on subject weight or at the investigator discretion based on weekly/monthly total volume.

Blood samples for PK analysis were collected in the teduglutide treatment arm at baseline (predose, and 1 hour and 4 hours postdose) and at Week 7 (2 hours postdose).

At the end of the treatment period (Week 24), all subjects entered a 4-week follow-up period until the end of study (Week 28/EOS) during which time subjects received standard medical therapy, but no investigational product was administered. At the end of the treatment period, some subjects who completed the study had the opportunity to participate in a long-term extension study, SHP633 304, in which eligible subjects would continue to receive teduglutide. The follow-up period for subjects in the teduglutide treatment arm may have been truncated and the subjects could have proceeded immediately to the EOS visit if at least 1 'escape' criteria was met.

## Assessor´s comments

SHP633-301 is described in 6.1. Please refer for Assessors comments.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 7.2. Results

## Disposition of Subjects

Disposition of subjects is presented in SHP633-301 Clinical Study Report (CSR), Section 10.1.

Eight subjects completed the study. Two subjects discontinued from the study: 1 subject in the teduglutide arm met escape criteria during the follow-up period and 1 subject in the SOC arm discontinued early from the study during the treatment period. In addition, 1 subject interrupted teduglutide treatment following Week 10 visit due to the parents' decision to stop teduglutide administration as they thought several AEs were caused by the study drug; teduglutide treatment never resumed and the subject completed the study.

## Demographics and Baseline Characteristics

Demographic and baseline characteristics are presented in SHP633-301 CSR, Section 10.4. The mean corrected gestational age was 8.4±2.71 months. All but 1 subject in the teduglutide arm and 2 subjects in the SOC arm were male. All subjects were white except 1 subject in each treatment arm who were Asian; no subjects were Hispanic or Latino.

The mean baseline weight, length, and weight/length ratio Z-scores for the safety set were at 0.7±1.43, 0.2±1.64, and 0.7±1.12, respectively, and similar between the 2 treatment arms. One subject in the teduglutide arm had baseline weight and weight/length ratio Z-scores of 3.7 and 2.4, respectively, and 1subject in the SOC arm had baseline weight and weight/length ratio Z scores of 2.8 and 2.2, respectively.

Short bowel history is presented in SHP633-301 CSR, Section 10.4.3.1. The main underlying causes of SBS were gastroschisis and necrotizing enterocolitis. One subject in the SOC arm had a colostomy. All subjects had at least some remaining colon and the mean percent of remaining colon was 65.6±23.37 overall; the remnant colon was in continuity in 9 (90.0%) subjects and 1 subject in the teduglutide arm had an ileocecal valve present.

## Efficacy Results

Efficacy/PD analyses of PS and enteral nutrition (EN) data were based on weight-normalized PS/EN volume and caloric intake. All efficacy data were presented for the intent-to-treat (ITT) set unless otherwise specified.

Analyses of weekly PS and EN were based on 2 data sources: the subject diary data (also referred to as actual data) and the investigator prescribed data. In previous studies of teduglutide, the subject diary data were considered a more representative measure of efficacy/PD than the investigator prescribed data. However, several subjects in this study had missing or lost diary data at baseline or EOT. Due to limitations in diary data, both data are presented.

## Reduction in PS Volume

The reduction in PS volume at EOT and by visit based on subject diary and prescribed data are presented for the ITT set in SHP633-301 CSR, Section 11.1.1.1 and Section 11.1.1.2, respectively.

The primary efficacy endpoint is the reduction in weight-normalized PS volume of at least 20% at Week 24/EOT from baseline. Based on subject diary data, 3 (60.0%) subjects enrolled in the teduglutide treatment arm and 1 (20.0%) subject in the SOC arm experienced at least 20% reduction in PS volume at EOT from baseline (2 subjects in the SOC arm had missing data). Based on prescribed data, 3 (60.0%) subjects enrolled in each treatment arm experienced at least 20% reduction in PS volume at EOT from baseline.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on subject diary data, the mean (±SD) PS volume at baseline was 95.3±45.93 mL/kg/day for subjects in the teduglutide treatment arm. The mean change in PS volume at EOT from baseline was 21.5±28.91 mL/kg/day, corresponding to a mean percentage change of 24.8±34.72%. The mean PS volume at baseline was 70.9±14.44 mL/kg/day for subjects in the SOC arm. The mean change in PS volume at EOT from baseline was 9.5±7.50 mL/kg/day, corresponding to a mean percentage change of 16.8±16.39%.

Based on prescribed data, the mean (±SD) PS volume at baseline was 94.0±45.03 mL/kg/day for subjects in the teduglutide treatment arm. The mean change in PS volume at EOT from baseline was 22.9±26.94 mL/kg/day, corresponding to a mean percentage change of 27.3±33.52%. The mean PS volume at baseline was 67.7±13.65 mL/kg/day for subjects in the SOC arm. The mean change in PS volume at EOT from baseline was 14.9±12.32 mL/kg/day, corresponding to a mean percentage change of 22.4±17.20%.

The mean ±SE plots of percent change in PS volume by visit based on diary and prescribed data are presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively.

## 7.3. Discussion

SHP633-301 was a randomized, open-label study consisting of a 2- to 4-week screening period, a 24 week treatment period, and 4-week follow-up period.

The main underlying causes of SBS were gastroschisis and necrotizing enterocolitis. Efficacy/PD analyses of PS and enteral nutrition (EN) data were based on weight-normalized PS/EN volume and caloric intake.

The primary efficacy endpoint is the reduction in weight-normalized PS volume of at least 20% at Week 24/EOT from baseline. Based on subject diary data, 3 (60.0%) subjects enrolled in the teduglutide treatment arm and 1 (20.0%) subject in the SOC arm experienced at least 20% reduction in PS volume at EOT from baseline (2 subjects in the SOC arm had missing data). Based on prescribed data, 3 (60.0%) subjects enrolled in each treatment arm experienced at least 20% reduction in PS volume at EOT from baseline.

## 7.4. Safety

The MAH proposes to update the Summary of Clinical Safety with the results of pediatric investigation plan (PIP) SHP633-301 (PIP Study 8), a study to evaluate the safety, efficacy/PD, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of teduglutide in infants 4 to 12 months of age with SBS who are dependent on parenteral support (PS).

## Methods - analysis of data submitted

## Description of all Clinical Studies and Narratives of Safety Studies

SHP633-301 was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, consisting of 2- to 4-week screening period, a

24-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period. At the baseline visit (Week 0), subjects were randomized (1:1 ratio) to the teduglutide or standard of care (SOC) treatment arm. Randomization was stratified according to the presence of a small bowel ostomy (eg, end jejunostomy or ileostomy). Subjects had to be receiving at least 50% of fluid or calories parenterally and have stable PS requirements for at least 1 month prior to screening and weigh at least 5 kg with a weight-for-length Z-score greater than -2 at screening and baseline.

During the 24-week treatment period, subjects in the SOC arm received standard medical therapy for SBS; while those in the teduglutide arm received 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneous once daily in addition to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

standard medical therapy. Subjects in both arms followed the same visit schedule and assessments. Subjects were monitored weekly with phone or clinic visits. Clinic visits occurred at Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28. At all site visits and telephone contacts, safety was monitored and nutritional support was reviewed and adjusted as needed.

At the end of the treatment period (Week 24/EOT), all subjects entered a 4-week follow-up period until the end of study (Week 28/EOS) during which time subjects received standard medical therapy, but no investigational product was administered. At EOS, subjects may have enrolled in the SHP633-304 extension study, in which subjects would continue to receive teduglutide. The follow-up period for subjects in the teduglutide treatment arm may have been truncated, and the subjects may have proceeded immediately to the EOS visit if at least 1 of the \"escape\" criteria was met. Refer to SHP633301 clinical study report (CSR), Section 9.1 for additional details.

Changes to the study procedures may have been implemented for study participants or study sites that were impacted by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that required physical distancing and may have resulted in subjects missing their visits. Procedural changes implemented in Study SHP633301 due to the COVID-19 pandemic are presented in SHP633-301 CSR, Section 9.8.1.3. Protocol deviations related to the COVID-19 pandemic impact are provided in SHP633-301 CSR, Section 10.2.2.

A schematic representation of the study design is presented.

*At end of study (EOS), all subjects regardless of treatment arm may have enrolled in an extension study if that study was op en to enrollment at the time of the SHP633301 EOS that captured long -term safety data and provided the opportunity for additional teduglutide treatment. The followup period for subjects in the teduglutide treatment arm may have been interrupted and the subjects may have proceeded immediately to the EOS if at least 1 'escape' cr iteria was met.

## Assessor´s comments

Study SHP633-301was described in 6.1. Please refer to CHMP comments. At the end of the treatment period (Week 24/EOT), all subjects entered a 4-week follow-up period until the end of study (Week 28/EOS) during which time subjects received standard medical therapy, but no investigational product was administered. At EOS, subjects may have enrolled in the SHP633-304 extension study, in which subjects would continue to receive teduglutide. The follow-up period for subjects in the teduglutide treatment arm may have been truncated, and the subjects may have proceeded immediately to the EOS visit if at least 1 of the \"escape\" criteria was met.

## Results

## Overall Extent of Exposure

The safety set (SAF) consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of teduglutide and had at least 1 post-baseline safety assessment (teduglutide arm) and of all subjects who had at least 1 postbaseline safety assessment (SOC arm). A total of 10 subjects were randomized in the study, 5 subjects in teduglutide arm and 5 in the SOC arm. The mean duration of exposure to teduglutide in the SAF was 149.4±42.15 days (range 74 days to 169 days). Four subjects had ≥24 weeks (168 days) of treatment and 1 subject had 4 weeks to &lt;12 weeks (28 days to &lt;84 days) of treatment.

## Demographic and Other Characteristics of Study Population

Demographic and other characteristics of the study population are presented in SHP633-301 CSR.

All but 1 subject in the teduglutide arm and 2 subjects in the SOC arm were male. All subjects were white except 1 subject in each treatment arm who were Asian; no subjects were Hispanic or Latino. The corrected gestational age of subjects was similar between the 2 treatment arms. Overall, the mean corrected gestational age was 8.4±2.71 months, with the majority (7/10 [70.0%]) of subjects being in the 6 months to 12 months corrected gestational age category. Mean baseline weight, length, and weight/length ratio Z-scores were similar between the 2 treatment arms.

Short bowel history is presented in SHP633-301 CSR. The main underlying causes of SBS were gastroschisis (3 and 2 subjects in the teduglutide and SOC treatment arms, respectively), necrotizing enterocolitis (1 and 2 subjects in the teduglutide and SOC treatment arms, respectively), intestinal atresia (1 subject in the teduglutide treatment arm), and other (1 subject in the SOC arm). One subject in the SOC arm had a stoma. All subjects had some colon remaining, and the mean remaining small intestine was 29.2±25.10 cm overall; the remnant colon was in continuity in 9 (90.0%) subjects, and 1 subject in the teduglutide arm had an ileocecal valve present.

TEAE=treatment -emergent adverse event; n=number of subjects experiencing the event; m=number of events

Treatmentemergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as any adverse event on or after the first dose for the subjects teduglutide treatment arm, and on or after the randomization date for the subjects in standard of care treatment arm. Adverse events with an unknown date of onset and a stop date after the start of the date of first dose or unknown are included as TEAEs.

Percentages are based on the number of subjects in the population in each treatment group.

Subjects were counted by the treatment most recently taken when the event occurred.

Subjects are counted no more than once for incidence, but can be counted multiple times for the number of events.

Note: SOCs and PTs were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 21.0.

## Adverse Events by Relationship

Overall, 9 TEAEs reported in 2 (20.0%) subjects were deemed related to study drug by the investigators; both subjects were enrolled in the teduglutide arm. Details of these TEAEs are provided in SHP633-301 CSR.

One subject experienced 8 of the 9 TEAEs assessed as related to study drug (abdominal distension, gastrointestinal sounds abnormal, vomiting [5 events], and faecal volume increased) as well as multiple non-related TEAEs all linked to the gastrointestinal system. These related TEAEs resolved and were deemed intermittent, mild to moderate in severity by the investigator; the events of vomiting (2 events), gastrointestinal sounds abnormal, and faecal volume increased led the subject's parents decision (it was not the investigator's decision in the interest of safety) to interrupt dosing with study drug which never resumed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One subject experienced a TEAE of ALT increased (152 U/L; normal range 6-34 U/L) at Week 20 which was deemed related to study drug by the investigator The subject showed elevated AST and ALT values at baseline (224 U/L and 243 U/L, respectively) and intermittently during the study including the last study visit at Week 24 (94 U/L and 88 U/L, respectively). Two events of ALT increased were reported for this subject; only the second event was deemed related to study drug. That TEAE was deemed moderate in severity, resolved at Week 24, and no action with study drug was taken. The subject's bilirubin values remained normal throughout the study (Section 0).

## Adverse Events by Severity

Details of TEAEs by severity are provided in SHP633-301 CSR, Section 12.2.3.2.

The majority of TEAEs were mild in severity. There were 3 severe TEAEs were reported during the study, 1 event in a subject in the teduglutide treatment arm (device leakage [related to central venous catheters used to administer PS, not to the teduglutide injection device]) and 1 event in 2 subjects in the SOC arm (device related infection). All severe TEAEs were assessed as serious due to the subjects' hospitalization and not related to study drug by the investigator (Section 0).

## Deaths

There were no deaths during the study.

## Other Serious Adverse Events

Overall, 11 TESAEs were reported in 7 subjects, 4 (80.0%) subjects in the teduglutide treatment arm and 3 (60.0%) subjects in the SOC arm. All TESAEs were assessed as non-related to teduglutide treatment by the investigators.

For the teduglutide arm, the system organ classes with subjects reporting TESAEs were Product issues (2 [40.0%] subjects), and General disorders and administration site conditions and Immune system disorder (1 [20.0%] subject each. A total of 5 TESAEs were reported in the teduglutide arm: 1 subject experienced 2 events of pyrexia, 1 subject experienced the event of immunisation reaction, 1 subject experienced the event of device breakage and another subject the event of device leakage (both device events related to central venous catheters used to administer PS, not to the teduglutide injection device). The events of pyrexia preceded by non-serious TEAEs of blocked Hickman line, broken Hickman line, and intermittent vomiting, and were reported as serious due to the subject's hospitalization. The event of immunisation reaction was described as fever secondary to immunisations on result of negative blood cultures. The subject presented with pyrexia and vomiting and required hospitalization for sepsis the same day. That same day, the subject was administered intravenous antibacterial treatment, and blood was collected from the central line for blood culture, which showed no growth at 48 hours.

For the SOC arm, the system organ classes with subjects reporting TESAEs were Infections and infestations (2 [40.0%] subjects), and Investigations, Metabolism and nutrition disorders, Nervous system disorders and Product issues (1 [20.0%] subject each). A total of 6 TESAEs were reported in the SOC arm: 2 subjects experienced the events of device related infection, 1 subject experienced the event of transaminases increased, and 1 subject experienced all the events of metabolic acidosis, ataxia, and device occlusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All TESAEs were deemed non-related to teduglutide treatment by the investigators, all required hospitalization of the subjects. The TESAEs of device leakage and device related infection were reported as severe.

The mean (±SD) cumulative number of hospitalization days during the treatment period was 4.7±2.89 and 4.0±1.41 in the teduglutide and SOC arms, respectively.

TESAE=treatment -emergent serious adverse event; n=number of subjects experiencing the event; m=number of events

Treatmentemergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as any adverse event on or after the first dose for the subjects teduglutide treatment arm, and on or after the randomization date for the subjects in standard of care treatment arm. Adverse events with an unknown date of onset and a stop date after the start of the date of first dose or unknown are included as TEAEs.

Percentages are based on the number of subjects in the population in each treatment group.

Subjects were counted by the treatment most recently taken when the event occurred.

Subjects are counted no more than once for incidence, but can be counted multiple times for the number of events.

Note: SOCs and PTs were coded using MedDRA 21.0.

## Other Significant Adverse Events

## Discontinuations Resulting from Adverse Events

There were 5 TEAEs reported in 1 subject enrolled in the teduglutide arm that led to study drug discontinuation (vomiting [2 events], gastrointestinal sounds abnormal, irritability, and faecal volume increased). Teduglutide treatment was interrupted at Day 75 (after Week 10 visit) following the parents', not the investigator's, decision to interrupt administration as they thought several AEs were caused by the study drug; it was not the investigator's decision in the interest of safety but he was informed. The TEAEs of vomiting, gastrointestinal sounds abnormal, and faecal volume increased were deemed related to study drug and mild in severity by the investigator (except for 1 event of vomiting deemed moderate in severity). The event of irritability was deemed non-related to study drug and mild

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in severity by the investigator. All events recovered and resolved. Teduglutide treatment was never resumed. SHP633-301 CSR, Section provides a complete narrative for this subject.

Adverse Events of Special Interest

There were no AESIs (events of polyps of the colon, benign neoplasia of the gastrointestinal tract, or tumor-promoting ability) reported during the study.

## Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome

Teduglutide was generally well tolerated in infants aged 4 months to 12 months corrected gestational age with SBS, and no new safety issues were identified. The safety profile was favorable and consistent with the safety profile seen in other pediatric studies, the underlying disease, and previous experience with teduglutide in adult subjects with SBS. The benefit-risk profile for teduglutide remains favorable and unchanged.

## Narratives

Narratives for subjects who experienced an SAE during the study are provided in SHP633-301 CSR, Section.

## Clinical Laboratory Evaluations

## Laboratory Values Over Time

Overall, no clinically meaningful mean changes in hematology values or urinalysis values were observed during the study. There were no clinically meaningful changes in serum chemistry values during the study other than increased ALT (1 subject in the teduglutide treatment arm) and both increased ALT and increased transaminases (each in 1 subject in the SOC arm). Liver enzyme parameters (alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, direct bilirubin, bilirubin, and GGT) over time are presented graphically by visit in the SHP633-301 CSR.

## Individual Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Laboratory Values

No clinically significant abnormal values for hematology were reported during the study (SHP633-301 CSR. For individually clinically significant chemistry laboratory abnormalities, a markedly increased ALT value &gt;8 x ULN was noted in 1 subject in the SOC arm. The subject had several elevated (higher than the normal range [6-34 U/L]) ALT values, with a markedly increased ALT value (101 U/L, &gt;8 x upper limit of normal) at Week 16. The subject also had elevated AST (normal range 10-56 U/L) and GGT (normal range 0-24 U/L) values at both Week 12 and Week 16. The subject's bilirubin values remained mostly low or normal throughout the study; C-reactive protein values were elevated on 2 unscheduled visits at Week 12 and Week 21). No adverse events were reported for any of these elevated laboratory values.

A markedly high international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;1.5 value was noted in 1 subject in each treatment arm. The subject in the teduglutide arm had a markedly high INR value (2.4) at the baseline visit; the INR decreased to 1.1 at EOS (Week 28); this subject had ongoing prophylactic heparin treatment when receiving intravenous nutrition. The subject in the SOC arm, who presented a stable INR between 1.0 and 1.2 during the study, experienced a single elevated INR at 2.0 at the Week 16 visit, which was accompanied by an elevated prothrombin time (20.5 seconds [normal range of 9.712.3 seconds]). No adverse events were reported for these elevated values.

## Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety

## Vital Signs

Overall, no clinically meaningful changes were observed in vital signs (pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or temperature other than increased ALT and increased transaminases values each in 1 subject in the SOC arm and increased ALT in 1 subject in the teduglutide treatment arm.

## Body Weight, Length, Weight/Length Ratio, and Head Circumference Z-score

Changes in body weight, length, and weight/length ratio Z-scores were within the expected range for the subjects' age group and comparable between the teduglutide treatment arm and the SOC arm. Head circumference Z-scores observed in the SOC arm seemed to drop further over time compared with the teduglutide treatment arm.

## Fecal and Urine Outputs

No clinically meaningful changes in mean urine output or stool output were observed in either the teduglutide or SOC arm. In the teduglutide arm, the mean average number of stools per day at Week 24 was 2.3±1.44 stools/day from a baseline of 5.2±2.23 stools/day, corresponding to a change of -3.3±3.55 stools/day. In the SOC arm, the mean average number of stools per day at Week 24 was 5.2±1.04 stools/day from a baseline of 2.5±1.66 stools/day, corresponding to a change of 1.7±1.76 stools/day.

## Antibodies to Teduglutide

None of the 3 subjects in the teduglutide arm who were tested at the Week 12 and Week 28 (EOS) visits had antibodies to teduglutide detected (SHP633-301 CSR, Section 12.5.3.4 ).

## Assessor´s comments

Overall, there were a total of 87 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in 10 (100%) subjects. The TEAEs reported by subjects during the study were mostly mild in severity and deemed not related to study drug by the investigators. There were 9 TEAEs deemed related to study drug by the investigators in 2 (40.0%) subjects in the teduglutide arm. There were 5 treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) in 4 (80.0%) subjects in the teduglutide arm and 6 TESAEs in 3 (60.0%) subjects in the SOC arm; no TESAEs were deemed related to study drug by the investigators.

There were 5 TEAEs reported in 1 subject enrolled in the teduglutide arm which led to treatment discontinuation. There were no AESIs and TEAEs leading to death.

Overall, 9 TEAEs reported in 2 (20.0%) subjects were deemed related to study drug by the investigators; both subjects were enrolled in the teduglutide arm. Details of these TEAEs are provided in SHP633-301 CSR.

One subject experienced 8 of the 9 TEAEs assessed as related to study drug (abdominal distension, gastrointestinal sounds abnormal, vomiting [5 events], and faecal volume increased) as well as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

multiple non-related TEAEs all linked to the gastrointestinal system. These related TEAEs resolved and were deemed intermittent, mild to moderate in severity by the investigator; the events led the subject's parents decision to interrupt dosing with study drug which never resumed.

One subject experienced a TEAE of ALT increased (152 U/L; normal range 6-34 U/L) at Week 20 which was deemed related to study drug by the investigator. The subject showed elevated AST and ALT values at baseline (224 U/L and 243 U/L, respectively) and intermittently during the study including the last study visit at Week 24 (94 U/L and 88 U/L, respectively). Two events of ALT increased were reported for this subject; only the second event was deemed related to study drug. That TEAE was deemed moderate in severity, resolved at Week 24, and no action with study drug was taken. The subject's bilirubin values remained normal throughout the study.

The majority of TEAEs were mild in severity. There were 3 severe TEAEs were reported during the study, 1 event in a subject in the teduglutide treatment arm (device leakage [related to central venous catheters used to administer PS, not to the teduglutide injection device]) and 1 event in 2 subjects in the SOC arm (device related infection).

Overall, 11 TESAEs were reported in 7 subjects, 4 (80.0%) subjects in the teduglutide treatment arm and 3 (60.0%) subjects in the SOC arm. All TESAEs were assessed as non-related to teduglutide treatment by the investigators.

There were no AESIs (events of polyps of the colon, benign neoplasia of the gastrointestinal tract, or tumor-promoting ability) reported during the study.

Changes in body weight, length, and weight/length ratio Z-scores were within the expected range for the subjects' age group and comparable between the teduglutide treatment arm and the SOC arm. Head circumference Z-scores observed in the SOC arm seemed to drop further over time compared with the teduglutide treatment arm. The MAH should discuss the drop in head circumference Z-scores observed in the SOC arm as compared to the TED arm (OC) .

## Discussion

At the end of the treatment period (Study SHP633-301, week 24/EOT), all subjects entered a 4-week follow-up period until the end of study (Week 28/EOS) during which time subjects received standard medical therapy, but no investigational product was administered. At EOS, subjects may have enrolled in the SHP633-304 extension study, in which subjects would continue to receive teduglutide. The follow-up period for subjects in the teduglutide treatment arm may have been truncated, and the subjects may have proceeded immediately to the EOS visit if at least 1 of the \"escape\" criteria was met.

A total of 10 subjects were randomized in the study, 5 subjects in teduglutide arm and 5 in the SOC arm. The mean duration of exposure to teduglutide in the SAF was 149.4 ± 42.15 days (range 74 days to 169 days). Four subjects had ≥ 24 weeks (168 days) of treatment and 1 subject had 4 weeks to &lt;12 weeks (28 days to &lt;84 days) of treatment.

All but 1 subject in the teduglutide arm and 2 subjects in the SOC arm were male. All subjects were white except 1 subject in each treatment arm who were Asian; no subjects were Hispanic or Latino. The corrected gestational age of subjects was similar between the 2 treatment arms.

The main underlying causes of SBS were gastroschisis and necrotizing enterocolitis.

Overall, there were a total of 87 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in 10 (100%) subjects. The TEAEs reported by subjects during the study were mostly mild in severity and deemed not related to study drug by the investigators. There were 9 TEAEs deemed related to study drug by the investigators in 2 (40.0%) subjects in the teduglutide arm. There were 5 treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) in 4 (80.0%) subjects in the teduglutide arm and 6 TESAEs in 3 (60.0%) subjects in the SOC arm; no TESAEs were deemed related to study drug by the investigators.

There were 5 TEAEs reported in 1 subject enrolled in the teduglutide arm which led to treatment discontinuation. There were no AESIs and TEAEs leading to death.

Overall, 9 TEAEs reported in 2 (20.0%) subjects were deemed related to study drug by the investigators; both subjects were enrolled in the teduglutide arm. Details of these TEAEs are provided in SHP633-301 CSR.

## Clinical aspects

## Question 1

The MAH is asked to present the number of plasma samples collected and used for analysis in study SHP633-301

## MAH's response

Per protocol of study SHP633-301, subjects had blood samples taken for teduglutide PK analysis at predose, 1 hour ±10 minutes, and 4 hours ±10 minutes postdose at baseline (Visit 0, baseline visit). The predose sample was not collected from subjects who weighed less than 7 kg. Some subjects also had blood samples taken for teduglutide PK analysis at 2 hours ±10 minutes postdose at Week 7 (Visit 7) of the treatment period. By definition, the PK set consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of teduglutide and had at least 1 evaluable and interpretable postdose PK concentration value. Therefore, the PK set consisted of 5 subjects with a total of 19 PK samples collected via a sparse sample collection approach.

Table 1 presents the PK sample concentration results from 5 subjects receiving teduglutide treatment. Since time-independent PK properties of teduglutide were confirmed during drug development, sparse PK sample collections are considered adequate for evaluation of PK in infant subjects. All of the aforementioned PK concentrations were presented in the CSR for Study SHP633-301, Table 19 for PK evaluation. The sparse samples were also included in the population PK analysis to characterize PK properties in pediatric subjects less than 1 year of age, confirming the Cmax similarity across age groups, and thereby supporting 0.05 mg daily dosing in pediatric subjects who are 4 months to less than 1 year of age (refer to Table 12.1, SHIR-CSC-129\\_PKglobal).

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH has presented the number of plasma samples collected and used for analysis in study SHP633-301 as requested. The MAH states that the PK set consisted of 5 subjects with a total of 19 PK samples collected via a sparse sample collection approach. The sparse samples were included in the population PK analysis to characterize PK properties in pediatric subjects less than 1 year of age. The MAH states that Cmax similarity was observed across age groups supporting 0.05 mg daily dosing in pediatric subjects who are 4 months to less than 1 year of age.

In the SmPC section 5.2 the MAH is asked to delete 'which drives the efficacy' to keep data factual for the prescriber:

'Paediatric population

Following subcutaneous administration, similar Cmax of teduglutide across age groups (4 months to 17 years) was demonstrated by population pharmacokinetics modelling. which drives the efficacy responses. However, lower exposure (AUC) and shorter halflife were seen in paediatric patients 4 months to 17 years of age, as compared with adults. The pharmacokinetic profile of Revestive in this paediatric population, as evaluated by clearance and volume of distribution, was different from that observed in adults after correcting for body weights. Specifically, clearance decreases with increasing age from 4 months to adults. No data are available for paediatric patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and endstage renal disease (ESRD).'

## Question 2

The MAH is asked to discuss the clinical significance of the presented exposure-safety results in regards of nausea and abdominal pain, which should include instructions for prescribing physician e.g. dose adjustments. The MAH should also explain the discrepancy between the results of the probabilities of nausea and vomiting, since these TEAS are normally closely related

## MAH's response

## Clinical Significance for Nausea and Abdominal Pain

The exposure-safety analysis results showed a statistically significant relationship between steady state teduglutide exposure Cmax or AUC versus nausea or abdominal pain (refer to SHIR-CSC-129\\_ERglobal). The results suggested that increased teduglutide exposure was associated with an increased probability of nausea or abdominal pain. In the analyses (using Cmax as an example), 234 subjects who received either placebo, 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05 or 0.1 mg/kg daily doses were included in the datasets, which were split into placebo and 4 quartiles, based on exposure, with N of 35, 50, 49, 50, and 50, respectively.

The distributions of Cmax across quartiles are presented in Table 2, which shows that approximately 83% of Cmax values in Q4 quartiles were observed for the 0.10 mg/kg dose regimen. Conversely,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

approximately 70% of the Cmax values in the 2nd or 3rd quartiles were observed for the 0.05 mg/kg dose regimen. Figure 15 (Cmax versus nausea) and Figure 16 (Cmax versus abdominal pain) of SHIRCSC-129\\_ERglobal show that a total of 15 and 19 respective subjects had exposures that were within the exposure distribution range of Q4 quartiles, respectively. The majority of these subjects received 0.1 mg/kg daily treatment with teduglutide. Overall, the above results suggest that Cmax values in the Q4 quartiles, which were mainly observed for the 0.10 mg/kg regimen, were associated with a higher probability of nausea or abdominal pain. Since a 0.05 mg/kg daily dose only provides a small percentage of subjects with potential exposure in the Q4 quartiles, no dose adjustment is recommended based on these evaluations. Nausea and abdominal pain are both listed in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), Section 4.8 as very common adverse reactions of teduglutide and the SmPC, Section 4.2 instructs prescribers that efficacy and safety in all patients should be closely monitored on an ongoing basis according to clinical treatment guidelines. The MAH therefore concludes that no further update to the SmPC is currently warranted.

## Datasets for Nausea and Vomiting

The exposure-safety results showed a statistically significant relationship between steady state teduglutide exposure Cmax or AUC versus nausea, but not versus vomiting (refer to SHIR-CSC-129\\_ERglobal). The MAH agrees that the TEAEs of nausea and vomiting are usually closely related. However, a review of the SBS datasets reveals the following:

- Among 50 subjects of the Q4 quartiles, 8 subjects had vomiting (SHIR-CSC-129\\_ERglobal, Figure 5) and 15 subjects had nausea (SHIR-CSC-129\\_ERglobal, Figure 16).
- Among the 8 subjects with vomiting, 1 subject had vomiting only, and 7 subjects had both nausea and vomiting.
- Among the 15 subjects with nausea, 8 subjects had nausea only and 7 subjects had both nausea and vomiting.

Based on the findings above, the majority of vomiting subjects did have nausea concurrently, suggesting the subjects having both vomiting and nausea were part of the nausea group and had more severe symptoms. The majority of nausea subjects did not have vomiting, suggesting the two datasets are not greatly overlapping. The 15/50 nausea subjects in the Q4 quartile roughly doubles the number of vomiting subjects (8/50), which makes the exposure-safety curve for nausea go up significantly (pvalue = 0.0164) and drives the difference in the exposure-safety relationships between exposurenausea and exposure-vomiting. These evaluations are expected to represent the true exposure-safety relationships, given the significant size of the datasets obtained in the SBS populations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH agrees that the TEAEs of nausea and vomiting are closely related as the majority of vomiting subjects did have nausea concurrently. Furthermore, the MAH clarifies that 15/50 nausea subjects in the Q4 quartile roughly doubles the number of vomiting subjects (8/50), which makes the exposuresafety curve for nausea go up significantly (p-value = 0.0164) and drives the difference in the exposure-safety relationships between exposure-nausea and exposure-vomiting. In addition, the SmPC, Section 4.2 instructs prescribers that efficacy and safety in all patients should be closely monitored on an ongoing basis according to clinical treatment guidelines. The MAH therefore concludes that no further update to the SmPC is currently warranted. This is accepted. But the MAH is asked to move the sentence in section 4.8 to section 5.1 and a minor modification is requested. Please also refer to SmPC.

## Conclusion

## Issue solved with SmPC update.

Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly

- No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance

## Question 3

The MAH is asked to discuss the clinical relevance of the presented results for reduction or change in:

- a) PS Caloric Intake
- b) EN volume
- c) daily PS usage

## MAH's response

Parenteral support (PS)-dependent children with short bowel syndrome-associated intestinal failure (SBS-IF) have a high disease burden. Long-term administration of parenteral support (PS = parenteral nutrition and/or intravenous fluids) is life-saving but is often associated with potentially life-threatening complications, including IF associated liver disease, central line-associated blood stream infections, and central venous thrombosis. Therefore, accelerating the adaptive process and achieving enteral autonomy is a clinically relevant and urgent goal for all patients with SBS who are dependent on PS (Khan et al., 2015; Squires et al., 2012). Clinical parameters that would usually change in association with weaning-off of parenteral support include decreased PS caloric intake, increased EN volume/EN caloric intake, and a decrease in hours/day of PS.

## a) PS Caloric Intake

In Study SHP633-301, the observed changes in PS caloric intake are always reflective of the observed changes in PS volume given the stable concentration of PS. Further, the subject diary data for PS volume are generally considered a more representative measure of efficacy/PD than the investigator prescribed data, since those data reflect the actual volume of PS taken by the subject. Therefore, the diary data results are discussed below (prescribed data are located in the CSR for Study SHP633-301, Section 11.1.1.2).

A clinically meaningful reduction in weight-normalized PS caloric intake is a reduction of at least 20% at Week 24/EOT. Three (60.0%) subjects enrolled in the teduglutide treatment arm and 1 (20.0%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subject in the SOC arm experienced at least 20% reduction in PS caloric intake at EOT from baseline (2 subjects in the SOC arm had missing diary data at baseline).

This translates to an average difference of -16.1 kcal/kg/day (-27.0%) caloric intake per day at EOT from a baseline mean caloric intake of 67.3 kcal/kg/day for the teduglutide treatment arm, versus an average difference of -6.1 kcal/g/day (-13.7%) at EOT from a baseline mean caloric intake of 65.1 kcal/kg/day for the SOC arm.

Overall, the results from the subject diary data showed a relatively higher number of subjects achieving clinically meaningful reductions in PS calories and a higher percentage of the average reductions in PS calories within the teduglutide arm than the SOC arm (CSR for Study SHP633-301, Section 11.1.1.2).

## b) Change From Baseline in EN Volume

The effect of PS volume reduction can also be seen in an increase in enteral feeds. Consistent with the earlier 24-week Phase 3 study in 50 pediatric subjects with SBS (TED-C14-006 study results) and the 12-week open label study in 46 pediatric subjects (TED-C13-003), Study SHP633-301 has shown that teduglutide treatment resulted in increases in EN volume and EN caloric intake. A clinically meaningful increase in EN volume and EN caloric intake is an increase of at least 20% from baseline. EN volume changes do not necessarily correspond to proportionate PS volume changes because other factors (ie, nutritional deficiencies, fluid or electrolyte disequilibrium, etc) would also affect enteral feeding (Vanderhoof and Matya, 1999).

The subject diary data showed that 2 subjects (40%) in the teduglutide arm had a 20% increase from baseline in EN volume and EN caloric intake at EOT versus no subjects in the SOC arm.

## c) Daily PS Usage

Nutrition plays an important role in the management of short bowel syndrome. The institution of early and aggressive enteral therapy is the most important stimulus for intestinal adaptation and the eventual discontinuation of parenteral therapy. A decrease in daily PS usage indicates less dependence on parenteral therapy.

In the teduglutide arm, the mean reduction of time required for daily PS was -3.1 hours (-28.9%) at EOT from a baseline of 11.2 hours. In the SOC arm, the mean change was -0.3 hours (-1.9%) from a baseline of 13.0 hours.

Enhancing intestinal adaptation minimizes dependence on PS, thereby reducing the risk of complications and potentially improving quality of life. Beyond potentially decreasing the occurrence of PS comorbidities, more time off PS may lead to more opportunities to normalize daily function for both subjects and their parents, thereby offering further opportunities to continue working on oral rehabilitation during off PN/IV hours (Blüthner et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020).

Consistent with prior studies, long term administration of teduglutide was temporally associated with significant reductions in PS volumes while the SBS subjects continued to maintain their nutritional status. These reductions in PS volume, PS calories and daily PS usage were also associated with substantial increases in EN volume and calories. Although enteral autonomy was not achieved in both treatment arms of the study, these parameters, collectively, indicate progress towards weaning off from parenteral support with long term teduglutide use in these subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH has discussed the clinical relevance of the presented results as requested:

## a) PS Caloric Intake

A clinically meaningful reduction in weight-normalized PS caloric intake is a reduction of at least 20% at Week 24/EOT. Three (60.0%) subjects enrolled in the teduglutide treatment arm and 1 (20.0%) subject in the SOC arm experienced at least 20% reduction in PS caloric intake at EOT from baseline (2 subjects in the SOC arm had missing diary data at baseline). This translates to an average difference of -16.1 kcal/kg/day (-27.0%) caloric intake per day at EOT from a baseline mean caloric intake of 67.3 kcal/kg/day for the teduglutide treatment arm, versus an average difference of -6.1 kcal/g/day (13.7%) at EOT from a baseline mean caloric intake of 65.1 kcal/kg/day for the SOC arm.

## b) Change From Baseline in EN Volume

A clinically meaningful increase in EN volume and EN caloric intake is an increase of at least 20% from baseline. EN volume changes do not necessarily correspond to proportionate PS volume changes because other factors (i.e., nutritional deficiencies, fluid or electrolyte disequilibrium, etc). The subject diary data showed that 2 subjects (40%) in the teduglutide arm had a 20% increase from baseline in EN volume and EN caloric intake at EOT versus no subjects in the SOC arm.

## c) Daily PS Usage

A decrease in daily PS usage indicates less dependence on parenteral therapy. In the teduglutide arm, the mean reduction of time required for daily PS was -3.1 hours (-28.9%) at EOT from a baseline of 11.2 hours. In the SOC arm, the mean change was -0.3 hours (-1.9%) from a baseline of 13.0 hours.

## Conclusion

## Issue solved.

Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly

No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance

## Question 4

Head circumference Z-scores observed in the SOC arm seemed to drop further over time compared with the teduglutide treatment arm. The MAH should discuss the drop in head circumference Z-scores observed in the SOC arm as compared to the TED arm.

## MAH's response

The head circumference z-score is a standardized measure with the adjustment for the median values among the normal population at the same age, according to the World Health Organization z-score calculation charts. A drop in the head circumference z-scores over time may be interpreted to mean that subjects in the SOC arm are delayed in their head circumference development when compared to the median growth reference standards per the WHO definition.

Additionally, Table 3 shows that while one subject had a slight increase in head circumference over time, subject's head circumference z-scores decreased concurrently, which drove the mean values by visit in the SOC arm to the lower end. Further, this subject was the only subject with recorded head circumference z-scores, -2.44 and -2.44 for the Week 24 and EOT/ET study visits, respectively.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH states that drop in the head circumference z-scores over time may be interpreted to mean that subjects in the SOC arm are delayed in their head circumference development when compared to the median growth reference standards per the WHO definition. The MAH has presented data illustrating that one subject had a slight increase in head circumference over time, his head circumference z-scores decreased concurrently, which drove the mean values by visit in the SOC arm to the lower end. Further, this subject was the only subject with recorded head circumference z-scores, -2.44 and -2.44 for the Week 24 and EOT/ET study visits, respectively.

This is accepted.

## 11. Request for 2. supplementary information

The MAH is asked to update the SmPC in line with the comments made in the appended PI.

## 12. Assessment of the responses to the request for supplementary information

## Question

The MAH is asked to update the SmPC in line with the comments made in the appended PI.

## MAH's response

The MAH took into consideration the latest comments for the PI, shared along with the Updated CHMP Rapporteur Assessment Report, dated 12 Oct 2021 and would like to propose one related change.

- Section 4.8 of the SmPC

The MAH agrees with the minor modification to remove the statement 'Teduglutide was well tolerated in these infant subjects.'. However, the MAH would respectfully ask if it would be possible to keep the proposed statement in 4.8, as initially submitted, instead of moving it to section 5.1 of the SmPC.

We are of the opinion that this statement would be more suitable in the section 4.8, rather than section 5.1, as it refers to the reported adverse events: 'Adverse events reported in the study were consistent with the safety profile seen in the previous paediatric studies and no new safety issues were identified.'.

Also, we would like to note that section 5.1 of the SmPC has already been updated with the relevant information related to this study: 'A 24¬-week, randomized, open-label, multicentre study was conducted in 10 infant patients 4 to 12 months of age with SBS dependent on parenteral support. The objective was to evaluate safety, efficacy/pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of teduglutide. Subjects were randomized into 2 groups, standard of care (SOC) arm (n=5) and teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg/day treatment (TED) arm (n=5).'. The MAH considers that, by moving the statement proposed in section 4.8 to the section 5.1, this would result in having some of the information duplicated.

Based on the above, we would kindly request to reevaluate the proposal to move the statement from section 4.8 to section 5.1 of the SmPC.

- Section 5.2 of the SmPC

The MAH agrees with the changes suggested for the section 5.2

An updated PI is included as part of this submission, in line with the MAH`s comments.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH has agreed to remove the sentence 'Teduglutide was well tolerated in these infant subjects.' from section 4.8 in the SmPC but argues to keep the statement in section 4.8 . The MAH is of the opinion that the statement would be more suitable in section 4.8 and also highlights that section 5.1 already has been updated with the relevant information regarding this study.

The assessor accepts the MAH's explanation and agrees with the proposed wording in section 4.8:

'In a completed clinical trial in paediatric subjects (aged 4 to 12 months corrected gestational age), a total of 10 subjects were randomized, 5 in the teduglutide arm and 5 in the Standard of Care arm, of which eight subjects completed the study. Adverse events reported in the study were consistent with the safety profile seen in the previous paediatric studies and no new safety issues were identified.'

Regarding section 5.2 the MAH has amended the section as requested and deleted the sentence 'Which drives the efficacy responses' .

- [ ] No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance
