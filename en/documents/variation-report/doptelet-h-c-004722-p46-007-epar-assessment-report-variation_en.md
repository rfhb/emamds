## 1. Introduction

On May 7 th  2024, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Doptelet, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The CSR for AVA-PED-301 that is the basis for this P46 submission is submitted as a stand-alone submission with only the study results. However, the MAH also writes that a grouped line extension to register a new paediatric formulation and a type II variation to expand the immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) indication to include peadiatric use is planned.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that AVA-PED-301 is a stand-alone study.

Avatrombopag for paediatric ITP has been evaluated under a PIP (EMEA-001136-PIP01-11).  In summary, the PIP required data from juvenile toxicology studies, development of an age-appropriate formulation, and conduct of a clinical trial in subjects with persistent or chronic ITP who have had an insufficient response to a prior therapy, preceded by a PKPD assessment to define starting doses for the clinical trial.

The sponsor submitted a request for a partial compliance check on 28 Nov 2019, and EMA adopted a compliance report on 28 Feb 2020.  Table 1 briefly describes the required studies and their status.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study&lt;ies&gt;

For patients who cannot swallow the commercial 20 mg Doptelet tablets, avatrombopag has been formulated as a powder for oral suspension that contains 10 mg avatrombopag in a capsule for opening. The capsule is opened, the contents are mixed into a small amount of a compatible liquid or soft food and the resulting suspension is administered as a single dose.

Initial work towards a formulation that could be used for preparation of an oral suspension was conducted to develop an age-appropriate formulation for subjects ≥1 to &lt;6 years of age with ITP.  As noted above, the PIP activities associated with development of an age-appropriate formulation (Studies 1 and 2) have been determined to be compliant.

The initial potential age-appropriate formulation evaluated was a dispersible tablet that was intended to be administered as an oral suspension after its dispersion in a liquid.  In accordance with the PIP, a relative bioavailability study in adults was conducted. The tablet was dispersed in water to create a suspension; after oral administration, the suspension demonstrated a 22% higher Cmax and a 38% higher AUC compared to the commercial tablets under the fed condition (Doptelet is administered with food to reduce variability of exposure).

Due to its slow dispersion properties in water (&gt;15 minutes) the tablet for oral suspension was not further developed, rather the current powder for oral suspension in a capsule for opening was progressed.  These formulations have an identical excipient composition; the only difference is that rather than the granules being compressed into a dispersible tablet, they are provided in a capsule for opening.  As both are administered by adding the formulation to an appropriate vehicle to create a suspension, the dispersible tablet and powder for oral suspension are equivalent in all aspects at the time of administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The current powder for suspension formulation was used in the Phase 3 paediatric ITP study in the youngest cohort of subjects. Sprinkling and mixing granules or a powder into a liquid or soft food is not an unusual method of administering a medication to young paediatric patients, and there were no reported concerns in the study.  In addition, avatrombopag will not be the first treatment for ITP that these patients with a persistent or chronic illness receive; it will be indicated only in patients who are refractory to other treatments.   Parents or guardians would be expected to be experienced in administration of medications to young patients in their care.

## CHMP's comments:

This is considered acceptable.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Phase 3 ITP Study AVA-PED-301

A Phase 3b, Multi-center, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebocontrolled, Parallel-group Trial with an Open-label Extension Phase to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Avatrombopag for the Treatment of Thrombocytopenia in Pediatric Subjects with Immune Thrombocytopenia for ≥ 6 Months.

## 2.3.2. Thrombocytopenia for ≥ 6 MonthsClinical study&lt;ies&gt;

## Clinical study number and title

Phase 3 ITP Study AVA-PED-301

EudraCT Number: 2020-003232-40

NCT Number: 04516967

## Description

AVA-PED-301 was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in pediatric subjects with ITP of ≥ 6 months duration, with a 12-week Core Phase followed by an Openlabel Extension Phase to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK/PD profile of avatrombopag, as well as provide data on palatability/acceptability, dosing parameters, and response to treatment (Figure 1).

The study was planned to enroll 72 pediatric subjects, aged ≥ 1 to &lt;18 years (Figure 1). Subjects were assigned to 3 age cohorts in a 2:2:1 ratio, and subjects were randomized within each cohort in a 3:1 ratio to receive either avatrombopag or placebo. Subject age at the time of randomization was used. Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 enrolled more subjects than those enrolled in Cohort 3 to minimize the exposure of the youngest age group to placebo.

Enrollment into the Core Phase was staggered by descending age cohort.

- Cohort 1: ≥ 12 to &lt;18 years (n=21 avatrombopag; 7 placebo)
- Cohort 2: ≥ 6 to &lt;12 years (n=21 avatrombopag; 7 placebo)
- Cohort 3: ≥ 1 to &lt;6 years (n=12 avatrombopag; 4 placebo)

Abbreviations: PD, Pharmacodynamic; PK, Pharmacokinetic.

Enrollment continued during the data review of a given cohort after Week 10, or the data review after each cohort.

Subjects who did not show a platelet response (see Section 9.3.3.3) at the highest dose of study drug based on the subject's age cohort were to be terminated from the Core Phase and directly enrolled into the Extension Phase.

Subjects participating in the Core Phase entered a Screening Period followed by a 12-week Treatment Period after which they may have either completed the study with an End of Study Visit that occurred 30 days after the last dose of study drug or continued into the Extension Phase. The Core Phase of the study lasted 12 weeks (approximately 84 days), which did not include the 4-week Follow-up Period, with study visits occurring once weekly through the end of Week 12.

Until the last subject completed the Core Phase and the database was locked, the Sponsor (except for required pharmacovigilance reporting), all subjects, and all Investigators were to remain blinded to treatment received in the Core Phase.

## Methods

## Treatments

Avatrombopag film-coated oral tablets or matching placebo

Supplies of avatrombopag or placebo oral tablets were provided to the clinical sites.

Avatrombopag was provided as film-coated tablets, with each tablet containing avatrombopag maleate (equivalent to 20 mg of avatrombopag) and excipients. Matching placebo tablets were also provided for the Core Phase.

During the Extension Phase, open-label avatrombopag film-coated oral tablets were provided. The clinical site dispensed the number of tablets required for dosing each subject for a 30-day period (e.g., a monthly supply of thirty 20 mg tablets for a 20 mg daily dose).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Avatrombopag powder for oral suspension in a capsule or matching placebo

Supplies of avatrombopag or placebo powder for oral suspension were provided to the clinical sites in capsules that were opened to sprinkle the powder into an appropriate vehicle to make a suspension. Each avatrombopag capsule contained avatrombopag maleate (equivalent to 10 mg avatrombopag) and excipients. Matching placebo capsules, containing the same excipients as the active capsules, were also provided for the Core Phase.

During the Extension Phase, capsules containing avatrombopag powder for oral suspension were provided.

The clinical site dispensed the number of capsules required for dosing each subject for a 30-day period (e.g., a monthly supply of sixty 10 mg capsules for a 20 mg daily dose).

## Avatrombopag dosing and administration

Subjects received avatrombopag or matching placebo as either the film-coated oral tablet or the powder for oral suspension. The powder for oral suspension was contained in a capsule that was to be opened to sprinkle the contents into an appropriate vehicle to prepare the suspension. No partial dosing from the capsule was allowed; the entire contents were to be used to prepare the suspension.

On Day 1/Visit 2, Cohort 1 ( ≥ 12 to &lt;18 years old) had a starting dose of avatrombopag of 20 mg once daily, administered as an oral tablet, consistent with the approved adult dosing. The starting dose for Cohort 2 ( ≥ 6 to &lt;12 years old) was also 20 mg once daily administered as an oral tablet, and the starting dose for Cohort 3 ( ≥ 1 to &lt;6 years old) was 10 mg once daily administered as an oral suspension ( Table 2 ). The formulation received was recorded in the eCRF.

Subject age at the time of randomization was used. Initial dose regimen based on modeling and simulation. Actual initial dose in Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 could have been modified after modeling was completed using data from the previous cohort.

## Rescue therapies

Subjects may have received rescue therapy at the discretion of the Investigator if there was an urgent need to increase platelet count, such as in the case of life-threatening thrombocytopenia, in the opinion of the Investigator, or there were clinical signs and symptoms suggesting a potential bleed (e.g., wet purpura) or a major bleed. All rescue medications, including dose and frequency, were recorded in the eCRF.

Rescue therapy included the following:

- The addition of any new ITP medication or medication to treat thrombocytopenia, such as:
- Corticosteroids
- IVIg
- Anti-D
- Platelet transfusion
- Any increase in the Day 1/Visit 2 dose of a concomitant ITP medication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

TPO-RAs were not allowed as rescue therapy.

## Sample size

The sample size was based on the anticipated response rates for avatrombopag and placebo for the primary endpoint (durable platelet response) and the alternative primary endpoint (platelet response for at least 2 consecutive weeks).

Based on the eltrombopag PETIT2 study conducted in pediatric patients with chronic ITP, the durable response rates were 41.3 % and 3.4 % for eltrombopag and placebo, respectively (Grainger 2015). It was reasonable to assume that the treatment effect of avatrombopag would be very similar to that of eltrombopag due to both drugs being in the same class, having similar mechanisms of action, and treating similar patient populations (e.g., patients ≥ 1 to &lt;18 years old with relapsed or refractory disease after 1 or more previous treatments for ITP and a baseline platelet count &lt;30 × 109/L). With the 3:1 ratio of avatrombopag to placebo, a total of 72 subjects (54 avatrombopag and 18 placebo) would provide at least 90 % power to detect a treatment difference of 37.9 % in durable response at α =0.05, based on the Fisher's exact test.

In addition, a 12-week study of romiplostim in treating pediatric ITP patients showed that 88% of romiplostim-treated subjects achieved a platelet count ≥ 50 × 109/L for 2 consecutive weeks (alternative primary endpoint for this study), whereas none of the placebo-treated subjects achieved the same endpoint (Bussel 2011). With the 3:1 ratio of avatrombopag to placebo, a total of 72 subjects (54 avatrombopag and 18 placebo) would provide ≥ 99 % power to detect a treatment difference of 80 % in the proportion of subjects achieving a platelet count ≥ 50 × 109/L for 2 consecutive weeks at α =0.05, based on the Fisher's exact test.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

## Treatment allocation

During the 12-week Core Phase of the study, the subjects were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either avatrombopag or matching placebo.

The Extension Phase of this study is open-label, in which all subjects receive avatrombopag.

## Randomization strategy

During Day 1/Visit 2 of the Core Phase, after study eligibility had been confirmed, randomization assignment was performed using interactive response technology.

## Stratification

Randomization was stratified by age cohort. Subjects were also stratified by a baseline platelet count of ≤ 15 × 109/L or &gt;15 × 109/L to &lt;30 × 109/L to ensure treatment groups were approximately balanced.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Extent and maintenance of blinding

Following randomization, study drug was dispensed in a double-blind manner. The Sponsor, the subject, and the clinical site personnel were blinded to the treatment assignment.

The Sponsor and the project team remained blinded during the ongoing safety data review.

Interim PK/PD analyses were conducted by an unblinded designee.

No randomization or blinding was necessary for the Extension Phase as it is open-label and all subjects receive avatrombopag.

## Planned unblinding

At the initiation of the study, the Investigator was instructed on the method for breaking the blind during the Core Phase. The blind was not to be broken during the study unless considered necessary by the Investigator for emergency situations and/or for reasons of subject safety.

## Unplanned or unintentional unblinding

Unblinding at the clinical site for any other reason was considered a major protocol deviation.

The Investigator was to contact the Medical Monitor before breaking the blind, if possible. The reason for breaking the blind had to be fully documented.

## Statistical Methods

Unless otherwise stated, all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed for the FAS and PPS.

For the efficacy evaluation of platelet count responses, platelet counts assessed by local laboratories were used. Platelet counts collected via the central laboratory were used in the safety assessments of clinical laboratory tests.

The methods used for efficacy analysis for the Core Phase are summarized in Table 5 below. All CMH tests at α =0.05 within each age cohort were performed adjusting for baseline platelet count category ( ≤ 15 × 109/L vs. &gt;15 × 109/L). For the CMH test in the overall group, the test was performed adjusting for age cohort and baseline platelet count category. Fisher's exact test was used if the number of durable platelet responders was sparse in the strata (less than 3 in a specific subgroup). Durable platelet response with 2-sided 95 % exact binomial (Clopper-Pearson) CI was provided. The difference in response rate (avatrombopag - placebo) with 2-sided 95 % CI (Wald) was also provided.

Subjects without sufficient data for the determination of response status (i.e., responder vs. nonresponder) were treated as non-responders in the analysis.

For the primary efficacy endpoint determination, a subject must have remained in the Core Phase through at least Week 10 (to have at least 6 weeks of platelet count data starting from Week 5 to either Week 12 if the subject completed the Core Phase or the last week if the subject prematurely terminated the Core Phase). If a subject terminated the Core Phase prior to Week 10, they would be considered a non-responder for the primary efficacy endpoint.

Note: Fisher's exact test was to be used if CMH test failed.

If the test of the treatment effect on the primary efficacy endpoint was statistically significant, the statistical tests on the secondary efficacy endpoints were considered inferential; otherwise, the tests were considered descriptive, and no statistical inference could be drawn with regard to the secondary efficacy endpoints.

To control the family-wise Type I error rate at a significance level of α =0.05 (2-sided), a stepdown closed testing procedure was used when testing the secondary efficacy endpoints. The alternative primary efficacy endpoint was tested as the first (key) secondary endpoint. Starting with the first secondary efficacy endpoint, if the test was significant at α =0.05, then the test on the next endpoint was considered inferential; otherwise, the tests on the subsequent endpoints were considered descriptive only. This process was repeated from the top of the hierarchy for the remaining endpoints.

The efficacy variables collected during the Extension Phase were summarized descriptively.

The statistical methods are considered acceptable in this setting.

## Results

## Participant flow

## Core Phase

A total of 83 subjects were screened in the Core Phase, of whom 75 were enrolled in the study.

Eight subjects were considered screen failures because of failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria (7 subjects) and other reasons (1 subject).

A total of 75 subjects were randomly assigned to 3 age cohorts in a 2:2:1 ratio as shown below:

- Cohort 1: ≥ 12 to &lt;18 years (n=21 avatrombopag; 8 placebo)
- Cohort 2: ≥ 6 to &lt;12 years (n=20 avatrombopag; 8 placebo)
- Cohort 3: ≥ 1 to &lt;6 years (n=13 avatrombopag; 5 placebo)

Overall, 54 subjects were randomized to avatrombopag, and 21 subjects were randomized to placebo in the Core Phase (Table 6 below).

The majority (44 [81.5 %]) of the subjects randomized to avatrombopag completed both the Core Phase and Core Phase study treatment and the percentage of subjects who completed both the Core Phase and Core Phase study treatment was similar across the 3 cohorts. A total of 10 (18.5 %) subjects receiving avatrombopag discontinued the Core Phase and Core Phase study treatment due to lack of efficacy (7 [13.0 %] subjects), AEs (2 [3.7 %] subjects), and investigator discretion (1 [1.9 %] subject). In subjects randomized to placebo, 1 (4.8 %) subject completed both the Core Phase and Core Phase study treatment, and 20 (95.2 %) subjects discontinued the Core Phase study treatment, either due to lack of efficacy (19 [90.5 %] subjects) or an adverse event (1 [4.8 %] subject).

Overall, the mean (SD) age was similar in subjects receiving avatrombopag (8.9 [4.36] years) and placebo (9.9 [4.13] years), with a slightly higher percentage of male than female subjects in the avatrombopag group (55.6 % and 44.4 %) and a lower percentage of male than female subjects in the placebo group (42.9 % and 57.1 %) (Table 7). Most subjects in the study were not Hispanic or Latino (92.6 % in the avatrombopag group and 71.4 % in the placebo group), were White (88.9 % in the avatrombopag group and 71.4 % in the placebo group) and were from Europe (85.2 % in the avatrombopag group and 76.2 % in the placebo group). The mean weight, height, and BMI were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

similar between the subjects receiving avatrombopag and placebo. The demographic and baseline characteristics were generally similar among Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 except for age, weight, and height, as expected based on the defined age ranges for each cohort.

## CHMP's comments:

Overall, baseline characteristics were comparable between groups when considering the low number of participants in some of the groups.

## Number analysed

All randomized subjects (54 subjects receiving avatrombopag and 21 subjects receiving placebo) were included in the FAS in the Core Phase and Safety Analysis Set; 48 subjects receiving avatrombopag and 19 subjects receiving placebo were included in the PPS.

A similar proportion of subjects in the avatrombopag (6 [11.1 %] subjects) and placebo (2 [9.5 %]) groups were excluded from the PPS. The reasons for exclusion from the PPS were accidental unblinding, mis-stratification at randomization, and major protocol deviations which could impact endpoint evaluation.

a Percentage is based on the number of subjects with corresponding baseline platelet count (n).

b Denotes p-value from Fisher's Exact Test, which was used in place of CMH test due to sparse number of responders in the strata.

Note: CMH test is adjusted for baseline platelet count withing each age cohort. In the overall group, the CMH test is adjusted for age cohort and baseline platelet count.

Note: Baseline platelet count category is based on the data at randomization per IRT presented in Appendix 16.1.7.

Note: Durable platelet response is defined as subjects achieving at least 6 out of 8 weekly platelet counts ≥ 50 × 109/L during the last 8 weeks of the 12-week treatment period in the Core Phase in the absence of rescue medication. In the case of rescue medication being used, platelet count assessments from the start date of rescue medication up until 4 weeks after the end date of rescue medication will be excluded from analysis.

Note: Percentage is based on the number of subjects in the corresponding column (N).

The primary efficacy endpoint was durable platelet response as defined by the proportion of subjects achieving at least 6 out of 8 weekly platelet counts ≥ 50 × 109/L during the last 8 weeks of the 12-week Treatment Period in the Core Phase in the absence of rescue medication.

Avatrombopag met the primary endpoint, showing superiority over placebo (p=0.0077; 95 % CI: 16.5, 41.6) in adolescents and children with ITP ≥ 6 months duration.

Overall, 27.8 % of subjects achieved durable platelet response with avatrombopag. The durable platelet response was highest in Cohort 1 (42.9 %); however, the study was not powered to demonstrate durable platelet response within cohorts. No subject in the placebo group had a durable platelet response.

## CHMP's comments:

The primary endpoint, durable platelet response, was met with statistical significance. There were differences in response between the cohorts with the highest response in cohort 1. There were responders in all cohorts. No subject in the placebo group had a durable platelet response.

The alternative primary endpoint, platelet response, was defined as the proportion of subjects for whom at least 2 consecutive platelet assessments are ≥ 50 × 109/L over the 12 weeks of treatment in the Core Phase in the absence of rescue medication.

Avatrombopag met the alternative primary endpoint, showing superiority over placebo (p&lt;0.0001; 95% CI: 71.1, 91.8) in adolescents and children with ITP ≥ 6 months duration. Overall, 81.5 % of subjects in the avatrombopag group had a platelet response and this percentage was consistent across age cohorts.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## CHMP's comments:

The alternative primary endpoint, platelet response, was also met with statistical significance. No subject in the placebo group had a platelet response.

Other efficacy results (secondary endpoints)

- Across secondary efficacy endpoints, avatrombopag was superior (p&lt;0.0001) to the placebo group for percentage of the total weeks of treatment with the platelet count ≥50×109/L, platelet response at Day 8, and percentage of weeks of platelet count between ≥50×109/L and ≤150×109/L during the 12 weeks of treatment of the Core Phase.
- A significantly lower proportion of subjects in the avatrombopag group than in the placebo group (p=0.0008) required rescue therapy.
- The proportion of subjects with any bleeding event (Grade 1 to 4) was similar in the avatrombopag and placebo groups. A higher proportion of subjects in the placebo group experienced moderate (Grade 2) and severe (Grade 3) bleeding events, and a higher proportion of subjects in the avatrombopag group reported no bleeding events (Grade 0).
- The exploratory efficacy endpoint of durable platelet response during Month 3 in the absence of rescue therapy was superior for avatrombopag compared to placebo (p=0.0008).
- The palatability and acceptability questionnaire results showed the avatrombopag powder formulation mixed to make an oral suspension to be satisfactory for clinical use.

## CHMP's comments:

The secondary endpoints can be considered supportive of the efficacy of avatrombopag in the target population.

Abbreviations: AE, Adverse event; COVID-19, Coronavirus disease 2019; MedDRA, Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; N, Total number of subjects; n, Number of subjects; TEAE, Treatment-emergent adverse events.

Note: TEAE is defined as any AE that occurs after administration of the first dose of study drug.

Note: Adverse events are coded using MedDRA (Version 26.1).

Note: Subjects with more than 1 AE within a preferred term are only counted once in that category.

Note: TEAEs with starting date prior to the first dose date in the Extension Phase were classified as TEAEs in the Core Phase.

Note: Percentage is based on the number of subjects in the corresponding column (N).

## CHMP's comments:

The overall incidence of TEAEs during the 12-week treatment duration was higher in subjects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

receiving avatrombopag (92.6 %) vs. placebo (76.2 %). Across the cohorts, all subjects in

Cohorts 2 and 3 (100 % each) and 17 (81.0 %) subjects in Cohort 1 experienced TEAEs.

Curiously, epistaxis, ecchymosis and haematoma were more common in the avatrombopag arm compared with the placebo arm. However, petechiae, gingival bleeding and rectal haemorrhage were more common in the placebo arm.

Abbreviations: AE, Adverse event; MedDRA, Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; N, Total number of subjects; n, Number of subjects; TEAE, Treatment-emergent adverse events.

Note: TEAE is defined as any AE that occurs after administration of the first dose of study drug.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Note: Adverse events are coded using MedDRA (Version 26.1).

Note: Subjects with more than 1 AE within a preferred term are only counted once in that category.

Note: TEAEs with starting date on or after the first dose date in the Extension Phase will be classified as TEAEs in the Extension Phase.

Note: Percentage is based on the number of subjects in the corresponding column (N).

As of the cutoff date, the median avatrombopag treatment duration was 78.71 weeks in Cohort 1,

53.57 weeks in Cohort 2, and 25.86 weeks in Cohort 3.

TEAEs were reported in a total of 63 (86.3 %) subjects, which included 27 (93.1 %) subjects in Cohort 1, 26 (96.3 %) subjects in Cohort 2, and 10 (58.8 %) subjects in Cohort 3.

## CHMP's comments:

Overall, the most frequently reported ( ≥ 5 % overall) TEAEs were upper respiratory tract infection, epistaxis, cough, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, headache, oropharyngeal pain, petechiae, diarrhoea, nasal congestion, nausea, rhinitis, rhinorrhoea, ecchymosis, gastroenteritis, influenza, viral upper respiratory tract infection, abdominal pain, contusion, hematoma, head injury, iron deficiency, pharyngitis, thrombocytopenia, toothache, and vomiting.

## 2.3.2.2. Serious adverse events

## Core Phase

The overall incidence of SAEs was higher in subjects receiving avatrombopag (9.3 %) than placebo (4.8 %). Across the cohorts receiving avatrombopag, the incidence of SAEs was higher in Cohort 3 (15.4 %) than in Cohorts 1 (4.8 %) and 2 (10.0 %). The most commonly reported SAEs by SOC ( ≥ 2 subjects) included blood and lymphatic system disorders and gastrointestinal disorders. All SAEs by PT were reported in 1 subject each.

## CHMP's comments:

SAEs were rare and it is difficult to assess whether they can be attributed to the underlying pathology or to treatment.

## Extension Phase

Overall, SAEs were reported in 21.9 % of subjects, with higher incidences in Cohort 1 (24.1 %)

than in Cohorts 2 (22.2 %) and 3 (17.6 %).

The most commonly reported SAEs by SOC ( ≥ 2 subjects) included blood and lymphatic system disorders; gastrointestinal disorders; general disorders and administration site conditions; infections and infestations; injury, poisoning and procedural complications; respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders; and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.

The most commonly reported SAEs by PT included thrombocytopenia and epistaxis (4 [5.5 %] subjects each). Other SAEs were reported in 1 (1.4 %) subject each.

## 2.3.2.3. Deaths

No deaths were reported in the study as of the data cut-off date.

## 2.3.2.4. Key safety findings

Key safety findings during the Core Phase of the study include the following:

- Overall, subjects in the avatrombopag group experienced a higher incidence of treatmentemergent adverse events (TEAEs) (92.6 % vs. 76.2 %), related TEAEs (13.0 % vs. 4.8 %), and serious adverse events (SAEs) (9.3 % vs. 4.8 %) than the placebo group. However, the median duration of treatment of avatrombopag subjects (12 weeks) was twice that of placebo subjects (6 weeks).
- The majority of the TEAEs were mild (Grade 1; 48.1 % in avatrombopag and 33.3 % in placebo groups) or moderate (Grade 2; 40.7 % in avatrombopag and 42.9 % in placebo groups). Severe (Grade 3) TEAEs were reported in 2 (3.7 %) subjects receiving avatrombopag.
- No subject in the avatrombopag or placebo groups died or reported an AESI.
- Two (3.7 %) subjects in the avatrombopag group and 1 (4.8 %) subject in the placebo group discontinued study drug due to a TEAE.
- Analyses of changes from baseline over time in chemistry and hematology laboratory analytes did not reveal any clinically meaningful trends, except for platelet count.

Key safety findings during the Extension Phase as of the cutoff date (18 Dec 2023) are as follows:

- Overall, TEAEs were reported in 86.3 % of subjects; SAEs were reported in 21.9 % of subjects, with the most commonly reported preferred terms (PTs) being thrombocytopenia and epistaxis (5.5 % of subjects each). Grade 3 TEAEs were reported in 15.1 % of subjects and 1 subject experienced a Grade 4 TEAE.
- Overall, 6.8 % of subjects experienced TEAEs leading to study discontinuation, including aplastic anemia, bone marrow reticulin fibrosis, deep vein thrombosis, paresthesia and dysarthria, bone marrow disorder, blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, and aspartate aminotransferase increased.
- One subject experienced a thromboembolic event (deep vein thrombosis) and 4 subjects reported Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade ≥3 bleeding events.

## CHMP's comments:

The summary of the key safety findings is agreed upon.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The Core Phase of this Phase 3b, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallelgroup study included a total of 75 adolescents and children with ITP of ≥6 months duration enrolled to 1 of 3 age cohorts, with 54 subjects in total randomized to avatrombopag and 21 subjects in total randomized to placebo.

Avatrombopag met the primary endpoint of durable platelet response, showing superiority over placebo (p=0.0077). Durable platelet response, defined as the proportion of subjects achieving at least 6 out of 8 weekly platelet counts ≥50×109/L during the last 8 weeks of the 12-week Treatment Period

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in the Core Phase in the absence of rescue medication, was observed in 27.8 % of subjects in the avatrombopag group and no subjects in the placebo group. The durable platelet response to avatrombopag was the highest in Cohort 1 (42.9 %). An initial peak of median platelet count was observed after 2 weeks in all cohorts and the median platelet count generally remained above 50×109/L during the last 8 of the 12 weeks of treatment.

Avatrombopag met the alternative primary endpoint of platelet response, showing superiority over placebo (p=0.0001). Platelet response, defined as the proportion of subjects for whom at least 2 consecutive platelet assessments are ≥50×109/L over the 12-week Treatment Period in the Core Phase in the absence of rescue medication, was achieved by 81.5 % of subjects in the avatrombopag group, and this percentage was consistent across all cohorts. No subject in the placebo group had a platelet response.

All secondary endpoints related to platelet count responses showed a significant benefit of avatrombopag over placebo. Rescue medication use (corticosteroids or IVIg) was significantly higher in the placebo group. Bleeding events were similar between the avatrombopag and placebo groups with no statistically significant differences observed. A higher proportion of subjects in the placebo group experienced moderate and severe bleeding (WHO Grades 2 and 3) compared to the avatrombopag group and a higher proportion of avatrombopag subjects experienced no bleeding symptoms at all (WHO Grade 0) post-baseline during the Core Phase.

An exploratory efficacy endpoint, the durable platelet response at Month 3 (3 of 4 weekly platelet counts ≥50×109/L in weeks 9-12 in the absence of rescue medication) also showed that avatrombopag was superior to placebo. Results of a palatability and acceptability questionnaire showed the avatrombopag powder formulation mixed to make an oral suspension to be satisfactory for clinical use.

Avatrombopag was safe and well tolerated in this population of paediatric subjects ≥1 to &lt;18 years of age with ITP, and no new or unexpected safety findings were observed. In the Core Phase, there were no deaths or AESIs reported and few discontinuations due to AEs. As of the cut-off date for the Extension Phase, there have been no deaths and few discontinuations due to AEs; 1 thromboembolic event has been reported.

In this placebo-controlled study of heavily pre-treated children and adolescents with persistent and chronic ITP, avatrombopag showed significant efficacy for all platelet count endpoints and a significant reduction in the use of rescue medications.

## CHMP's comments:

Overall, the discussion of the efficacy and safety findings are acknowledged.

## 3. Rapporteur's CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

The MAH has submitted a CSR for the pediatric study AVA-PED-301, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006.

Furthermore, the MAH has expressed that the MAH plans to submit a Type II variation to extend the ITP indication to the paediatric population, and a line extension for the powder for oral suspension formulation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fulfilled:

No further action required, however further data are expected in the context of a grouped line extension and type II variation prior any conclusion on product information amendments is made. The MAH has committed to submit this grouped line extension and type II variation application.
