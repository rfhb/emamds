## 1. Introduction

Revatio 20 mg film-coated tablet is indicated for the Treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class III, to improve exercise capacity. Efficacy has been shown in  primary  pulmonary  hypertension  and  pulmonary  hypertension  associated  with  connective The active substance is sildenafil. The recommended dose is 20 mg three times a day.

PAH is a disease of the small pulmonary arteries that is characterised by vascular proliferation and remodelling. It results in a progressive increase in pulmonary arterial resistance and, ultimately, right ventricular  failure  and  death.  PAH  is  defined  by  right-heart  catheterization  showing  a  precapillary pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure &gt; 25 mmHg at rest or &gt; 30 mmHg with exercise,  with  a  pulmonary  artery  wedge  pressure  &lt;  15  mmHg).  There  is  a  female-to-male preponderance  (1.7:1),  with  patients  most  commonly  presenting  in  the  third  and  fourth  decades, although the age range is from infancy to greater than 60 years. A diagnosis for primary (or idiopathic) pulmonary hypertension is made when no known risk factor is identified. Baseline NYHA functional classification is a strong predictor of survival. The functional classification of PAH is as follows:

- Class  I:  PAH  without  a  resulting  limitation  of  physical  activity.  Ordinary  physical  activity does not cause undue dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near-syncope.
- Class II: PAH resulting in a slight limitation of physical activity. The patient is comfortable at rest,  but  ordinary  physical  activity  causes  undue  dyspnoea  or  fatigue,  chest  pain,  or  nearsyncope.
- Class III: PAH resulting a marked limitation of physical activity. The patient is comfortable at rest,  but  less  than  ordinary  activity  causes  undue  dyspnoea  or  fatigue,  chest  pain,  or  nearsyncope.
- Class IV: PAH resulting in an inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. The patient has signs of right heart failure. Dyspnoea, fatigue, or both may be present even at rest, and discomfort is increased by any physical activity.

As a general measure, patients with PAH are encouraged to engage in activities appropriate to their physical capabilities in order to prevent deconditioning and attendant worsening of overall function. No current treatment cures this rare, devastating condition. However, during the past treatment options for patients with the disease have evolved to help prolong their survival and improve their quality of life. Currently, conventional treatment for patients with primary and secondary PAH includes calciumchannel blockers, diuretics, anticoagulants and  oxygen.  In addition, an endothelin-1 receptor antagonist (bosentan), an intravenous prostacyclin (epoprostenol) and an inhaled prostacyclin (iloprost) have also been authorised for the treatment of PAH in various European countries. As a last resort, a lung or heart/lung transplant may be offered to the patient.

Sildenafil  is  an  orally-active,  potent  and  selective  inhibitor  of  the  enzyme  phosphodiesterase  5 (PDE5),  that  causes  the  breakdown  of  cyclic  guanosine  monophosphate  (cGMP).  Given  the  high levels of PDE5 in the pulmonary endothelium, and the role of the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP system in modulating  pulmonary  vascular  tone,  sildenafil  has  been  studied  in  PAH.  In  patients  with  PAH, inhibition  of  PDE5  could  lead  to  selective  (NO/cGMP-dependent)  vasodilatation  of  the  pulmonary vascular bed (with a lesser degree of vasodilatation in the systemic circulation), resulting in reduced pulmonary arterial pressure and symptomatic improvement.

Sildenafil  is  also  the  active  substance  of  Viagra  which  has  previously  been  authorised  through  the Centralised Procedure for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction (MED). The recommended dose for the treatment of MED is 50 mg and may be increased to 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg, with a maximum recommended dosing frequency of once per day.

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. Part II: Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

## Quality aspects

Sildenafil  citrate  is  currently  marketed  in  the  EU  as  Viagra  film  coated  tablets  (25,  50  or  100  mg) (EMEA/H/C/202). The EU marketing authorization for Viagra was approved on 14 September 1998. The  chemistry,  manufacturing  and  control  (CMC)  information  described  in  the  Drug  Substance section  of  Quality  Module  3  of  this  dossier  encompasses  the  original  Viagra  file  as  well  as  the subsequent  approved  variations  until  March  2004,  reformatted  in  Common  Technical  Document (CTD) format.

## Introduction

Revatio is presented as a white, round, biconvex film-coated tablets containing 20 mg of sildenafil (as citrate  salt)  as  active  substance.  Other  ingredients  are  cellulose  microcrystalline,  calcium  hydrogen phosphate  (anhydrous),  croscarmellose  sodium,  magnesium  stearate.  The  film  tablet  coat  contains Opadry  white  (hypromellose,  titanium  dioxide,  lactose  monohydrate  and  glycerol  triacetate)  and Opadry clear (hypromellose and glycerol triacetate).

The tablets are packed in PVC blister sealed with aluminium foil.

## Drug Substance (to be changed in the EPAR to 'Active Substance')

Sildenafil  citrate  has  the  chemical  name  1-[4-ethoxy-3-(6,7-dihydro-1-methyl-7-oxo-3-propyl-1 H -pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)phenylsulphonyl]-4-methylpiperazine citrate, and the structural formula is the following:

<!-- image -->

Sildenafil citrate is a crystalline, white to off white monomorphic solid.  The solubility of sildenafil citrate in water has been determined as being 3.5 mg/ml, at 23°C.  Solubility determinations in various buffers showed a maximum solubility of approximately 24 mg/mL at pH 2.0.  The intrinsic dissolution rate  has  been  found  to  be  0.2  mg/min/cm 2 in  water  and  0.7  mg/min/cm 2 in  0.01M  HCl.  Sufficient information  was  provided  on  physical  form,  solubility,  ionisation  constant,  thermal  properties, hygroscopicity  and  polymorphism.  There  are  no  structural  isomers  of  sildenafil  citrate  and  no polymorphs have been found of anhydrous sildenafil citrate. A new form of a citrate salt of sildenafil has  been  observed  during  recent  solubility  studies  of  sildenafil  citrate  at  4ºC.  This  form  has  been characterized as a hydrated form of sildenafil hemi-citrate. It has been demonstrated that the sildenafil hemi-citrate  hydrate  form  is  not  produced  under  conditions  employed  during  the  commercial manufacturing process for either the sildenafil citrate (anhydrous) drug substance or the drug product and that the different stoichiometry of the hemi-citrate hydrate prevents its formation during storage of either the drug substance or the drug product.

- Manufacture

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sildenafil citrate is synthesised in three steps. Optional purification procedures are described in order to  ensure  the  quality  of  the  isolated  intermediates.  Sildenafil  citrate,  the  finished  product,  may  be purified. The dry product is sieved or milled if necessary to meet the particle size acceptance criteria.

Adequate information on the starting  materials  and  reagents  and  solvents  were  provided,  including specifications,  methods  and  where  relevant  also  validations.  Specifications  have  been  set  for  the intermediate  products,  starting  materials  and  reagents.  The  impurities  are  discussed.  Methods  and where relevant validations have been provided

Batch  analysis  data  produced  with  the  proposed  synthetic  route  provided  show  that  the  active substance can be manufactured reproducibly.

- Specification

The  active  substance  specifications  includes  tests  for  appearance,  particle  size,  identification  (IR, HPTLC), assay (HPLC, 98-102%), purity, residual solvents, water, sulphated ash and heavy metals.

The specifications reflect all relevant quality attributes of the active substance. The analytical methods used in the routine controls are suitability described. The validation studies are in accordance with the ICH Guidelines. Impurity limits in the specification are justified by toxicology studies.

Certificates of analysis issued by the finished product manufacturer are provided. The results comply with the specifications.

- Stability

The  stability  parameters  tested  on  the  drug  substance  are  assay,  impurities,  appearance  and  water content.    Data  are  provided  for  four  batches  of  sildenafil  citrate  stored  at  25 ° C/60%  RH  and 30°C/60%RH  (both 5 years) and 40 ° C/75% RH (6 months). In addition, results from a photostability study are presented

All  the  above-mentioned  studies  demonstrate  that  sildenafil  citrate  is  intrinsically  stable  and  not sensitive to light. On the basis of the stability studies described above, it is concluded that sildenafil citrate  is  stable  under  recommended  storage  conditions  of  temperature  and  relative  humidity  and justify the proposed retest period.

## Drug Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

Several  strengths  of  conventional  immediate  release  white  film-coated  round  biconvex  tablets containing sildenafil  citrate  were  studied  in  development  for  potential  commercial  presentation.  All these strengths were prepared from a common blend of the active substances, which is qualitatively, and quantitatively equivalent to the blend used to produce Viagra tablets.

The only differences between Viagra tablets and Revatio tablets are the replacement of the blue dye in the film-coat with additional titanium oxide to give a white film-coat, and a change in the tablet shape and debossing.

Changes in the tablet formulation from clinical development to the commercial presentation are minor. The batches used in clinical trials only differ slightly in coating thickness and tablet dimension from the proposed commercial formulation. These changes are not considered to affect the bio-availability. Comparative dissolution results that have been provided confirm this.

The tablet  cores  contain  cellulose  microcrystalline  and  calcium  hydrogen  phosphate  (anhydrous)  as diluents,  crosscarmellose  sodium  as  disintegrant  and  magnesium  stearate  as  lubricant.  A  two  stage tablet coating employs an aqueous suspension of Opadry White followed by a clear coat of Opadry Clear. Both Opadry formulations contain glycerol triacetate and hypromellose whilst Opadry White also contains titanium dioxide and lactose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All excipients chosen are well-known and comply with the Ph Eur, except from the printing ink. The choice and function of the excipients in the formulation has been described.

Except  from  lactose  monohydrate  used  in  the  film-coating  no  excipients  are  of  animal  or  human origin.  It  is  confirmed  that  the  lactose  is  produced  from  milk  from  healthy  animals  in  the  same condition as those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without  the  use  of  ruminant  material  other  than  calf  rennet  according  to  the  Note  for  Guidance  on Minimising  the  Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform  Encephalopathy  Agents  Via  Human  and veterinary medicinal products'.

The  plastic  material  used  in  the  primary  packaging,  i.e.  PVC,  complies  with  the  relevant  Ph  Eur monograph.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process  involves  standard  technology  using  standard equipment: blending, roller compaction, sieving, tabletting, coating, and imprinting.

The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies  for  the  major  steps  of  the manufacturing process. The manufacturing process has adequately been validated and is satisfactory. The in process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.

The batch analysis data show that can be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this oral preparation.

## · Product Specification

The  product  specifications  include  tests  by  validated  methods  for  description,  identification  of sildenafil  (IR),  identification  of  citrate  (HPTLC),  assay  (95-105  %  of  the  label  claim,  HPLC), uniformity  of  mass,  water  content,  dissolution,  total  degradations  products  (HPLC),  identity  of titanium, and microbial purity.

The tests and limits of the specifications for the finished product are appropriate to control the quality of the finished product for their intended purpose.

Batch analysis data on eight batches (4 full scale and 4 pilot scale) confirm satisfactory uniformity of the product at release.

## · Stability of the Product

The registration stability programme was designed to cover 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg tablets packed into HDPE bottles and PVC blisters. As all three strengths are manufactured from a common blend, all of  the  data  from  the  registration  stability  programme  is  included  to  evaluate  the  stability  of  the product. The other strengths and containers studied are regarded as supportive data.

For the formal stability programme, three batches of 20 mg and 80 mg sildenafil citrate tablets were manufactured on production equipment at the proposed commercial manufacturing site at the intended commercial blend batch size. Three different lots of active substance were used.

The stability studies were carried out according to relevant CHMP/ICH stability guidelines at normal intermediate and accelerate ICH conditions for 6 months.

The following parameters have been tested: appearance, assay, degradation products, water content, hardness, dissolution, microbial quality and total degradation products.

One production batch of 20 mg and 80 mg has been stored for photostability at ICH conditions. The analytical methods are identical to those for release.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact  on  the  Benefit/Risk  ratio  of  the  product.  The  applicant  gave  a  Letter  of  Undertaking  and committed to resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe

## 3. Part III: Toxico-pharmacological aspects

## Introduction

Viagra,  which  has  already  been  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  erectile  dysfunction  through  the centralised  procedure,  also  contains  sildenafil.  Only  few  non-clinical  studies  for  Revatio  have  been conducted in addition to studies already performed for Viagra; 6 new pharmacology studies and 3 new pharmacokinetic studies. No new toxicology studies were conducted.

According to the applicant, toxicity and safety pharmacology studies were conducted in compliance with GLP regulations.

## Pharmacology

- Primary pharmacodynamics (in vitro/in vivo)

Sildenafil  inhibits  phosphodiesterase  (PDE)  5,  thereby  inhibiting  the  breakdown  of  cyclic  guanine monophosphate (cGMP). Elevated cGMP reduces levels of intracellular calcium and thereby causes relaxation of these smooth muscle cells.

The  N-desmethyl  metabolite  UK-103,320,  has  ca.  50%  of  the  potency  of  sildenafil  as  a  PDE5 inhibitor.  An  inhibition  study  on  human  recombinant  cyclic  nucleotide  phosphodiesterase  (PDE) enzymes 7 to 11 by sildenafil, or UK-103,320 clearly showed low inhibition properties of sildenafil and  its  major  metabolite  for  PDE  enzymes  7  to  11.  However  sildenafil  does  not  act  as  a  selective pulmonary  vasodilator  due  to  the  widespread  distribution  of  PDE5  in  vascular  smooth  muscle containing tissues.

The effect of increasing doses sildenafil was tested on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) in the  anaesthetised  dog.    In  this  model  of  pulmonary  hypertension,  caused  by  intermitted  severe hypoxia, sildenafil attenuated HPV and  reduced the  pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) even at the lowest dose tested (free plasma level below 5 nM). The response did not increase by increasing doses. It  should  be  noted  that  intermittent  hypoxia  in  man  seems  to  exert  only  a  small,  probably  clinical unimportant effect on pulmonary haemodynamics. Although in this model sildenafil has only a minor effect on systemic blood pressure vasodilator properties of sildenafil have been demonstrated in the anaesthetised dog at doses consistent with PDE5 inhibition. This implies a risk for adverse effects as facial flushing and headache.

- Secondary pharmacodynamics

Platelet aggregation experiments showed that sildenafil, in the presence of an NO donor, has an effect on platelets, with a possible antithrombotic effect but also a haemorrhagic risk. In animals, but not in humans, at least a trend in to increase bleeding times was found.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

From  studies  in  isolated  gastrointestinal  smooth  muscle,  it  is  clear  that  sildenafil  can  reduce gastrointestinal smooth muscle contractility most likely via the potentiation of the effects of NO, with a possible risk for inhibition of gastric emptying.

Sildenafil inhibits PDE6 in retina tissue at clinical relevant doses. Sildenafil had an effect in vitro on the response of the dog isolated retina to a blue light challenge and changed the ERG in anaesthetised dogs. Thus there is pharmacological basis for an effect on visual function.

A moderate affinity of sildenafil for some adenosine receptors was reported but it is 100-fold less than its activity against the human PDE5 enzyme.

- Safety pharmacology

The absence of PDE5 in cardiac muscle and the lack of effect on cardiac contractility suggest that sildenafil will not have adverse cardiac effects in pulmonary hypertension patients.

In line with sildenafil's haemodynamic profile, a modest antidiuretic effect was observed.

- Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted. Clinical studies of sildenafil when coadministered with other medicinal products for the treatment of PAH have been planned.

## Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic profile of sildenafil was studied in the mouse, rat, rabbit and dog.

- Absorption- Bioavailability

Sildenafil was rapidly and extensively absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in all species studied. Due to substantial presystemic elimination, however, absolute bioavailability was 15-54%. A species-specific gender difference in bioavailability was apparent in the rat.

- Distribution

In vitro the mean proportion of sildenafil bound to plasma proteins was 94% (mouse), 95% (rat), 91% (rabbit), 86% (dog) and 96% (man). The in vitro whole blood : plasma ratio for sildenafil was 0.92 and 0.64 in beagle and human blood, respectively. Except for the rat, the free fractions for sildenafil and its pharmacodynamically active N-desmethyl metabolite UK-103,320 were similar. Sildenafil and UK103,320  bound  to  human  albumin  and α 1-acid  glycoprotein.  Sildenafil  bound  predominantly  to albumin and UK-103,320 bound approximately equally to albumin and α 1-acid glycoprotein.

Tissue  distribution  of 14 C-sildenafil    was  studied  in  pigmented  and  albino  rats  upon  single  i.v.  or subcutaneous  dosing.  Radioactivity  was  widely  distributed.  In  general,  tissue  concentrations  of radioactivity in female rats were higher than those in males, and declined more slowly. Concentrations of radioactivity in rat brain were about 50% or less of those seen in blood. Concentrations in CSF were only  1-3%  of  those  in  plasma.  By  24  h  post-dose,  residual  radioactivity  was  limited  mainly  to  the retina,  substantia  nigra  and  pigmented  skin,  suggesting  that  sildenafil  and/or  its  metabolites  bind  to melanin.  The  concentration  of  radioactivity  in  albino  rats  declined  more  rapidly  compared  with pigmented animals.

- Metabolism (in vitro/in vivo)

In all species studied, sildenafil is metabolised extensively. Up to five primary metabolic pathways were identified. In animals, qualitatively similar metabolic profiles were found as compared with man. UK103,320  was  present  as  a  primary  metabolite  in  plasma  and  excreta  of  all  species  examined.  No

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

significant human-specific metabolites were identified. Male and female rats did not differ with respect to patterns of metabolites.

In  vitro studies  with  human  microsomes  showed  that  the  metabolism  of  sildenafil  to  UK-103,320  is mediated by CYP2C9 (high affinity, low capacity) and CYP3A4 (low affinity, high capacity). CYP3A4 appears the more important isoenzyme at clinically relevant concentrations. For human metabolism the most  relevant  pathways  are  the  piperazine  N-demethylation  into  UK-103,320  and  piperazine  N,Ndeethylation  into  UK-150,564.  The  proposed  mechanism  of  the  formation  of  both  UK-103,320  and UK-150,564 via a common event by formation of a common unstable intermediate seems plausible. Further,  CYP3A4  and  CYP2C9  being  the  most  relevant  enzymes  corresponds  to  the  results  from interaction studies.

- Excretion

In all species investigated, the predominant route of excretion was the faeces, which accounted for 7185% of the dose. The majority of excreted radioactivity  was  recovered  within  the  first  48  hours.  No studies were conducted on enterohepatic cycling.

In  male  rats,  a  higher  plasma  clearance,  shorter  elimination  half-life  and  lower  bioavailability  of sildenafil  was  observed  as  compared  with  females  reflecting  a  species-specific  gender  difference  in metabolic clearance.

- Pharmacokinetic drug interactions

The  most  potent  inhibitors  of  sildenafil  metabolism  in  human  liver  microsomes  were  ritonavir, itraconazole  and  ketoconazole  (IC50  &lt;  0.05  µM).  Also  potent  inhibitors  were  indinavir  and  nelfinavir (IC50 of both substances &lt; 1 µM) and saquinavir (IC50 5 µM). Cimetidine showed only limited potency to inhibit sildenafil metabolism (IC50 700 µM).

## Toxicology

Toxicokinetics were sufficiently monitored to base dose extrapolation on. In all toxicity studies, the levels of systemic exposure were adequate.

- Single dose toxicity

Single  dose  toxicity  was  low  as  tested  in  both  rats  and  mice  employing  the  p.o.  and  i.v.  routes  of administration.  Lethality  after  oral  administration  occurred  at  1000  mg/kg  and  500  mg/kg  in  rats  and 1000  mg/kg  in  mice.  Clinical  signs,  which  preceded  mortality,  were  partially  closed  eyes,  hunched posture, tremors and depression.

- Repeat dose toxicity

Repeated p.o. dose toxicity was extensively studied in mice (for three months), rats (for up to 6 months), and  beagle  (up  to  12  months).  In  addition,  some  relatively  short-term  studies  (up  to  1  month)  were conducted in rats and beagles employing the i.v. route of administration.

Mice  were  particularly  sensitive  as  they  died  probably  because  of  marked  gastrointestinal  dilation already at  low  dose  levels  leaving  no  AUC-based  safety  margin  (see  also  'Carcinogenicity'  section). This effect was due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic action of UK-92,480 resulting in a prominent reduction in transit time. This severe toxicity was not confirmed in other animal species nor in man. In rats, the main findings were anaemia, centrilobular hypertrophy in the liver, follicular cell hyperplasia in the thyroid, and hypertrophy of the zona glomerulosa in the adrenal cortex. The margin of safety was adequate. In addition, the kidney was occasionally identified as a target as well, although microscopic evidence of kidney changes (i.e. an increased incidence of glomerulonephrosis) only occurred in the 6month rat study. Clinical chemistry revealed a decrease in triglycerides and an increase in cholesterol levels in rats. The thyroid hypertrophy was shown to be a secondary response to liver enzyme induction (see also 'Carcinogenicity' section). The adrenal hypertrophy of the zona glomerulosa may be the result

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of  the  vasodilatory  properties  of  sildenafil  through  activation  of  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, a reflex response to a prolonged reduction in blood pressure.

Occasionally, a low incidence of mesenteric arteritis was seen in rats at high dose levels only. It was only found in the 1-month study, and did not occur in the subsequent rat studies where mesenteric arteries were specifically examined. Again at high dose levels, arteritis was also encountered in beagles, more frequently  than  in  rats.  The  arteritis  was  mainly  seen  in  the  coronary  arteries,  but  occasionally disseminated necrotising panarteritis was observed upon long-term administration as well. In both rats and beagles, arteriopathy has been reported in the open literature not only for PDE inhibitors, but for other  vasodilators  as  well.  The  arteriopathy  probably  is  due  to  a  reflex  response  to  the  exaggerated haemodynamic action  of  sildenafil,  although  the  beagle  studies  failed  to  show  a  consistent  effect  on blood  pressure.  In  the  literature,  it  has  been  suggested  that  prolonged  reductions  in  blood  pressure, together  with  alterations  in  intramural  tension  resulting  from  vasodilatation,  may  be  involved  in  the pathogenesis  of  vasodilator-induced  arteriopathy.  Alternatively,  the  arteriopathy  in  beagles  may  be designated  as  idiopathic  juvenile  arteritis  ('beagle  pain  syndrome').  This  dog-specific  syndrome  is thought to be an expression of a latent disease aggravated by stress, rather than a direct toxic effect of the test  compound.  Whatever  the  mechanism  may  be,  the  arteriopathy  seen  in  rats  and  beagles  is  not considered  relevant  to  man,  due  to  the  high  safety  margin,  and  the  low  incidence  with  no  clear relationship to dose.

In  dogs,  heart  rate  was  moderately  increased  in  all  studies,  with  no  consistent  changes  in  blood pressure.

Although  in  the  clinic  abnormal  vision  has  been  reported,  ophthalmological  and  histopathological examinations have not revealed unusual ocular findings in the animal toxicity studies.  It should be noted that the number of photoreceptors was not examined because this was technically impossible. Instead, the inner and outer nuclear layers of the retina were counted as an indirect indicator of the integrity of the photoreceptor layer.

No  adverse  effect  levels  in  the  rat  and  dog  were  60  mg/kg  and  15  mg/kg  respectively,  which corresponds to more than 10 times the human AUC of free sildenafil.

## · Genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo

Sildenafil  did  not  induce  mutations  in  bacterial  or  mammalian  cells  in  vitro,  nor  did  it  cause clastogenic activity in vivo or in vitro.

## · Carcinogenicity

The carcinogenic potential was studied in mice and rats. The mouse study was negative for carcinogenic findings. The most important adverse effect of sildenafil in mice (particularly the males) was an increase in mortality due to marked gastrointestinal dilation (see also 'Repeat Dose Toxicity' section). A second mouse study, with lower dosages and no difference in mortality between the groups, was also negative. In  high-dose  male  rats,  there  was  a  statistically  significant  positive  trend  for  thyroid  follicular  cell proliferative  changes.  This  was  mainly  related  to  an  increase  in  follicular  cell  hyperplasia.  The underlying mechanism is probably an increased turnover of thyroid hormones due to hepatic enzyme induction,  which  bears  no  relevance  to  man.  Evidence  for  this  mechanism  was  provided  (see  also 'Repeat Dose Toxicity' section).

## · Reproductive and developmental studies

In the segment I and II studies no remarkable toxicity was found in the offspring even in the presence of maternal toxicity. In the pre- and postnatal toxicity study in rats, a decrease was observed in mean litter size, in body weight gain in the first 14 days and, in 4-day survival. Dilatation of the ureter, and delay in the  appearance  of  upper  incisors  and  in  the  attainment  of  the  air  righting  reflex  were  also  observed. Foetal  ureter  and  dilatation  was  also  visible  in  the  rat  segment  II  study.  In  male  pups,  a  delayed attainment of the air righting reflex occurred already at the lowest dose of 10 mg/kg. For female pups, the assessed exposure safety margin was between 7 and 19 with the decreased 4-day survival as critical effect. No sperm analysis was conducted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The ureter  effects  seem  to  be  a  treatment-related  effect.  At  the  dosage  used,  the  exposure  multiple compared to humans is sufficiently high that it probably bears little relevance to humans.

A diminished blood supply to the uterus and placenta caused by sildenafil can be considered unlikely. The mechanism involved in the high dose effects observed in the pre- and postnatal study may be related to inhibition of oxytocin-induced contractions in the rat uterus, demonstrated in vitro.

- Local tolerance

Sildenafil produced no vascular irritation after intra-arterial injection in rabbits.

- Other toxicity studies

No studies were conducted in juvenile animals.

No studies were performed on immunotoxicity. This is acceptable because no signs of immunotoxicity were observed in the preclinical studies.

## Studies on impurities

The  impurity  UK-263,909  is  specified  at  0.3%.  This  impurity  was  toxicologically  qualified  up  to 0.3%. All other impurities are limited to 0.1%, which is lower than the qualification limit.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An environmental risk assessment was provided and accepted.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

The  overall  profile  of  sildenafil  suggests  that  it  is  a  potent,  orally-active  agent  which  relaxes pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, prevents platelet-based obstructions to blood flow in the presence of  NO  and  relaxes  peripheral  blood  vessels.  Several  possible  adverse  reactions  (vasodilatation, antidiuretic  effect,  haemorrhagic  risk,  inhibition  of  gastric  emptying  and  visual  disorder)  can  be associated with the use of sildenafil in view of its pharmacological profile.

Repeated  dose  toxicity,  genotoxicity  and  carcinogenicity  studies  did  not  reveal  special  hazards  for humans.

In pups of rats which were pre- and postnatally treated with 60 mg/kg sildenafil, a decreased litter size, a  lower  pup  weight  on  day  1  and  a  decreased  4-day  survival  were  seen  at  exposures  which  were approximately fifty times the expected human exposure at 20 mg TID. These effects were observed at exposures  considered  sufficiently  in  excess  of  the  maximum  human  exposure  indicating  little relevance to clinical use.  Due to lack of data, Revatio should not be used in pregnant women unless strictly necessary.

## 4. Part IV: Clinical aspects

## Introduction

More than thirty clinical pharmacology studies were conducted in the original sildenafil male erectile dysfunction (MED) development program. Of these, 24 are considered to support the proposed label for  treatment  of  PAH.  Fifteen  clinical  pharmacology  studies  were  conducted  post-approval  of sildenafil  in  MED.  One  new  clinical  pharmacology  study  (bosentan-sildenafil  interaction)  was conducted specifically for the PAH development program.

The PAH development program essentially consists of 2 studies in adults with PAH. Study A1481140, was  the  pivotal  12-week  placebo-controlled  dose  ranging  study,  after  which  patients  could  enter  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

long-term extension study A1481142. Study A1481141, exploring the use of sildenafil in combination with intravenous epoprostenol was still ongoing at the time of the marketing authorisation evaluation.

The safety and efficacy of sildenafil in children with pulmonary hypertension is not yet known, but it is    being  evaluated  in  2  ongoing  paediatric  trials.  An  indication  for  paediatric  patients  was  not requested in the current application.

According  to  the  applicant,  all  clinical  studies  conformed  to  ICH  Good  Clinical  Practice  (GCP) standards and were conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki (Edinburgh 2000 revision).

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic data on sildenafil are mainly based on studies in healthy volunteers in the framework of the MED  dossier, except for the interaction study with bosentan and the population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical studies 1140 and the main pharmacodynamic study (1024).

- Absorption

Absolute  bioavailability  of  sildenafil  is  approximately  40%,  where  first  pass  metabolism  is  almost completely  responsible  for  the  reduced  bioavailability.  Maximal  plasma  concentrations  are  reached one  hour  after  oral  administration  of  the  tablet.  Simultaneous  intake  of  food  delays  absorption (approximately with 1 h and Cmax is 29% lower) and lowers the extent of absorption marginally (ca. 11%). Food intake is not expected to affect steady state concentrations in a clinically relevant way. Population PK data support this finding.

Based  on  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis,  average  plasma  concentrations  were  20%  to  50% higher in PAH patients. Mean maximum exposure at steady state of sildenafil is 113 ng/ml after three times  daily  dosing  of  20  mg.  The  80  mg  TID  dosing  led  to  a  40%  higher  exposure,  i.e.  not  dose proportional, relative to 20 mg and 40 mg TID. There was a five-fold difference in exposure for the 80 mg TID dosing as compared to the recommended 20 mg TID dosing schedule.

- Distribution

Sildenafil has a volume of distribution of approximately 105 L, and a 95% protein binding. However, sildenafil only occupies a limited proportion of protein binding sites and is not expected to have an impact on protein binding of other drugs. Renal or hepatic impairment does not seem to affect protein binding of sildenafil and its main metabolite UK-103,320. Free fractions of sildenafil and UK-103,320 in young volunteers were approximately 1 % higher then in elderly volunteers (&gt;65 years).

## · Elimination

Sildenafil is metabolised extensively in the liver, predominantly mediated by two cytochrome P450 isoforms; CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. The main metabolite UK-103,320 has a plasma concentration of less than 50% of sildenafil in healthy volunteers and its pharmacological activity as a PDE inhibitor is half that of the parent compound. There is an increased concentration (up to 73% of the parent compound) of the metabolite in patients with PAH.  UK-103,320  therefore probably contributes to the pharmacological efficacy.

After  oral  administration  sildenafil  is  excreted  predominantly  in  the  faeces  (80%)  and  to  a  smaller extent in urine (13%).

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

In the range of 25 - 100mg orally once daily administered, sildenafil rate and extent of absorption are dose-proportional. Above this range, absorption increases to a somewhat greater extent (1.16 times the dose for AUC) than the dose is increased.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Steady state concentrations are reached on the second day after three times daily dosing, which fits to a t½ of 4h. Accumulation after multiple dosing is 36%-50%.

## · Special populations

Severe  renal  impairment  led  to  an  approximately  100%  increase  in  sildenafil  exposure.  Sildenafil exposure was increased by 85% in elderly subjects (65 and up) and in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A or B).

Simulations based on these population PK data with alternative dosing schedules with 20 mg BID or 20mg OD compared with thrice daily doses led to considerably lower average and minimum plasma sildenafil  exposure  in  these  patient  groups.  With  a  BID  dosing  schedule  sildenafil  plasma  levels reached roughly two-thirds of that of the TID dosing schedule. The effect of the simulations on Cmax was negligible in the selected patient groups with a larger effect on Cmin.

The clinical relevance of these almost two-fold increases in sildenafil exposure were discussed. In the pivotal study 1140 and its extension study 1142 doses up to 80 mg TID were used and 80 mg TID dose leads to a 5-fold higher exposure than the recommended 20 mg dose, which was well tolerated. There  is  therefore  a  wide  safety  margin  for  sildenafil  20  mg  TID.  Neither  age,  renal  or  hepatic impairment, as covariates, significantly affected sildenafil pharmacokinetics in patients with PAH, in a validated population kinetic model. All age groups (up to 75 years) and patients with renal impairment with a creatinine clearance &gt; 30 ml/min were well-represented. Therefore, dose adjustments are not considered necessary in the elderly and patients with mild-to-moderate (&gt;30 ml/min) renal impairment.

Only two patients in study A1481140 had a creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min. Impact of hepatic impairment was studied by individual laboratory parameters (AST, ALT, bilirubin and ALKP) and no signal was shown but it is not sufficient to exclude potential effect. For these particular subgroups of patients, observed high plasma exposure (85-100% increased AUC, 47-88% increased Cmax) should be carefully considered.

Since  underdosing  in  patients  with  the  serious  disease  should  be  avoided  and  there  is  no  clinical efficacy data in PAH patients on dosing regimens below 20 mg TID, sildenafil 20 mg TID would be an  acceptable  starting  dose  for  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  and  patients  with  mild-tomoderate  hepatic  impairment  (Child  Pugh  classes  A  and  B).  Nevertheless,  downtitration  should  be considered in case of intolerance.

Due to the lack of data, sildenafil should be contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class C).

No impact on pharmacokinetics was observed in female compared to male patients.

No pharmacokinetic studies were performed in children.

- Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

In-vitro sildenafil has been shown to be metabolized primarily by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme and to a lesser  extent  by  CYP2C9.  The  in-vivo  studies  and  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  of  the pivotal study confirmed that CYP3A4 was the most relevant metabolic pathway.

Sildenafil  (80  mg  TID  at  steady  state)  increases  bosentan  exposure  by  approximately  50%  while sildenafil  exposure  itself  decreases  by  approximately  60%  when  co-administered  with  bosentan. Bosentan is an inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. The pharmacokinetic interaction of bosentan and sildenafil is of importance since their co-administration cannot be excluded despite the current lack of clinical  efficacy  and  safety  data.  Due  to  the  complicated  pharmacokinetics  of  sildenafil  (possible saturation of metabolising enzymes) and bosentan (CYP auto-induction), and, the absence of efficacy and safety data on co-administration in patients with PAH, it is difficult to anticipate the actual clinical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

response. In the SPC it should be stated that currently no data are available from patients with PAH regarding  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  sildenafil  in  co-administration  with  other  treatments  such  as bosentan, iloprost and epoprostenol.

Co-administration  of  ritonavir  (500mg  BID)  a  potent  CYP3A4  and  CYP2C9  inhibitor  increased sildenafil (100 mg single dose) AUC 11-fold and Cmax 4-fold. Saquinavir (1200mg TID), a CYP3A4 inhibitor, led to a 140% increased Cmax and 210% increased AUC of sildenafil. A similar increase, AUC with 180%, was observed when erythromycin (CYP3A4 inhibitor) was co-administered. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole and itraconazole would be expected to have effects similar to ritonavir.  Co-administration  ritonavir  and  that  of  other  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitors  (ketoconazole, itraconazole) should be contra-indicated. In contrast with sildenafil's isolated use  in  MED, accumulation may occur after repeated dosing intended for treatment of PAH. Prolonged exposure to very  high  plasma  sildenafil  levels  bears  unacceptable  safety  concerns.  CYP3A4  inhibitors  of intermediate  potency  (e.g.  clarithromycin,  telithromycin  and  nefazodone)  are  expected  to  have  an effect in between that of ritonavir and CYP3A4 inhibitors of medium potency (e.g. saquinavir/erythromycin), a seven-fold increase in exposure is assumed. Therefore dose adjustments should be recommended when using CYP3A4 inhibitors of intermediate potency.

Cimetidine (800 mg) a non specific cytochrome P450 inhibitor led to a 56% increased sildenafil AUC. The impact of grapefruit juice (a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor) was not investigated. Population PK data showed that the frequently observed co-administration of CYP3A4 substrates led to a 43% increased sildenafil plasma concentration.

In  turn  sildenafil  did  not  affect  steady-state  concentrations  of  CYP3A4  substrates  ritonavir  and saquinavir.

In  the  population  PK  analysis,  CYP3A4  substrates  alone  or  in  combination  with  beta-blockers increased sildenafil exposure by 43% and 66% respectively.

The proportion of patients receiving CYP3A4 inducers in the PK population analysis was small, but had a substantial impact on sildenafil pharmacokinetics. This impact concurs with the findings of the bosentan  interaction  study.  Therefore,  treatment  should  be  closely  monitored  in  patients  using concomitant  potent  CYP3A4  inducers,  carbamazepine,  primidone,  phenytoin,  pyrazinamide  and rifampicin.

Sildenafil (50 mg) had no clinically relevant impact on CYP2C9 substrates tolbutamide (250 mg), and warfarin (40mg).

Co-administration of azithromycin, antacids (Maalox), amlodipine, doxazosin, atorvastatin, and oral contraceptives (Microgynon) did not affect sildenafil pharmacokinetics or vice versa.

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Mechanism of action

In  the  human  lung,  endothelium-derived  nitric  oxide  (NO)  activates  soluble  guanylate  cyclase, increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production, which opens potassium channels via cGMP  kinase  causing  pulmonary  vasorelaxation.  Sildenafil  is  an  inhibitor  of  cyclic  guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) enzyme phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), resulting in vasodilatation through the NO/cGMP  pathway  at  sites  expressing  this  enzyme.  Since  the  pulmonary  epithelium  contains substantial  levels  of  PDE5,  the  potential  clinical  benefit  of  sildenafil  in  the  treatment  of  PAH  was investigated.

## · Primary and Secondary pharmacology

The  main  pharmacodynamic  study  was  A1481024  that  investigated  key  haemodynamic  parameters such as pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) in patients with PAH during administration of various doses of intravenous sildenafil yielding a wide range of plasma concentrations  between  10-500ng/ml.  This  study  comprised  only  a  limited  amount  of  patients  per treatment group (n ≤ 14). Maximum reductions in the relevant pulmonary parameters mean PVR and mean PAP appeared to be reached at plasma sildenafil concentrations of 100 ng/ml, while reductions in mean systemic blood pressure were only minor at concentrations ≤ 100 ng/ml (in patients without NO). No clinically significant mean changes were observed in patients receiving placebo. This study therefore  indicated  that  oral  dosages  yielding  plasma  levels  up  to  100  ng/ml  could  comprise  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

clinically  useful  dose  range  containing relative  selectivity  to  the  pulmonary  circulation.  Mean  heart rate remained stable across the entire dose range of 10-500ng/ml in all subjects, and mean absolute values  of  cardiac  output  tended  to  increase  across  a  dose  range  of  10-100ng/ml,  but  appeared  to plateau at higher dosages. No clinically significant changes in blood gasses (PaO2, mVO2, Sp02) were observed, indicating no beneficial effects of sildenafil on the oxygenation status of patients with PAH.

Calculations from multiple dose PK study 148-207 indicated that sildenafil 40 mg TID would yield an expected peak total plasma concentration of 248 ng/ml, an average total plasma concentration of 93 ng/mL, and a trough concentration of 28.2 ng/ml. With 20 mg TID, the expected peak total plasma concentration  is  113  ng/ml,  the  average  total  plasma  concentration  40.3  ng/ml,  and  the  trough concentration  14.1  ng/ml.  Thus,  in  view  of  these  PK  data  and  the  data  derived  from  PD  study A1481024, a dose range around 20-40 mg TID would be appropriate for clinical testing, as this could yield (average) plasma concentrations within a potentially clinically appropriate plasma concentration range of 10-100 ng/ml. It should however be noted that despite this frequent dosing schedule (three times  daily),  the  peak  to  trough  plasma  concentration  ratio  is  still  considerable  due  to  the  short terminal  half  life  of  sildenafil  (3-5  hours),  rendering  sildenafil  generally  less  suitable  for  24-hr prophylactic treatment.

As  previously  described  in  the  labelling  for  Viagra,  PD  studies  comprising  visual  function  tests showed mild and transient differences in colour discrimination in some subjects using the FarnsworthMunsell 100 hue test at 1 hour following a 100 mg dose, with no effects evident after 2 hours postdose. These events were described mainly as difficulty in discriminating colours, colour-tinged vision, halo and increased perception of brightness. Meanwhile, healthy volunteer PD study 148-207 did not indicate an impact on colour discrimination after 8 days of chronic sildenafil dosing up to 75mg TID. The postulated mechanism for this change in colour discrimination at dosages of at least 100mg is related to inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in the phototransduction cascade of the retina. Further ophthalmic testing was also performed in the main clinical studies in patients with PAH chronically treated with sildenafil 20-80mg TID (see section on Clinical Safety).

## Pharmacodynamic interactions

Pharmacodynamic  interactions  have  focused  on  the  impact  of  sildenafil  on  bleeding  (warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, aspirin) and haemodynamics (GTN, ISMN, doxazosin, amlodipine, alcohol).  In  none  of  the  studies  focusing  on  bleeding  wasa  clinically  significant  potentiation  on bleeding time / INR  observed, either when co-administered with vitamin K-antagonists or aspirin.

Sildenafil, through its effect on the NO/cGMP pathway, potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates and  this  concomitant  use  is  therefore  rightfully  contra-indicated.  Co-administration  of  alcohol  and amlodipine  did  not  potentiate  the  BP  lowering  effect  of  sildenafil  alone.  Co-administration  of sildenafil with the alpha-blocker doxazosin did not potentiate the hypotensive effect of either drug but symptomatic  hypotensive  effects  cannot  be  excluded  in  susceptible  subjects.  As  a  consequence, sildenafil  should  be  contra-indicated  in  patients  with  severe  hypotension  (BP  &lt;90/50  mmHg)  and caution should be advised when sildenafil is administered to patients taking an alpha-blocker.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study Participants

Inclusion criteria included:

- -Subjects  aged  18  and  over who  had  any  of  the  following  conditions:  Primary  pulmonary hypertension (PPH), PAH with connective tissue disease (CTD) or PAH with surgical repair, at  least  5 years  previously,  of  heart  lesions  (atrial  septal  defect;  ventricular  septal  defect; patent ductus arteriosus; or aorto-pulmonary window).
- -Subjects  with  a  mean  PAP  (pulmonary  artery  pressure) ≥ 25mmHg and a pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) of &lt;15mmHg at rest, assessed via right heart catheterisation within 21 days prior to randomisation.

## Exclusion criteria included:

- -PAH secondary to any aetiology other than those specified in the inclusion criteria.
- -Significant ( ie &gt;2+)  valvular disease other than tricuspid regurgitation  or  pulmonary regurgitation,
- -Acute decompensated heart failure within the previous 30 days.

- -Severe impairment of hepatic function.
- -Pregnant or lactating women.

## Treatments

Subjects were randomised to one of four treatment groups: placebo, sildenafil 20mg, sildenafil 40mg, or  sildenafil  80mg).  Subjects  who  were  randomised  to  sildenafil  80mg  received  40mg  for  the  first seven days and then underwent an up-titration to 80mg. Subjects randomised to placebo, sildenafil 20mg or sildenafil 40mg underwent a dummy up-titration after seven days.

Sildenafil was added to existing PAH therapy but the administration of bosentan and prostacyclin was forbidden.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of three doses of oral sildenafil on exercise capacity, as measured by the 6-Minute Walk test, after 12 weeks of treatment in subjects with PAH who were aged 18 years and over.

Secondary  objectives  included  assessment  of  the  safety  and  tolerability,  investigation  of  plasma concentration-effect relationship and determination of the population pharmacokinetic parameters.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the total distance walked in 6 minutes at Week 12.

Secondary endpoints included:  mean  pulmonary  arterial  pressure  (PAP),  time  to  clinical  worsening and BORG dyspnoea score. Other descriptive variables were WHO pulmonary hypertension criteria for  functional  capacity  and  therapeutic  class,  haemodynamic  measurements  (such  as  cardiac  output [CO], right atrial pressure [RAP], pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [PCWP], pulmonary vascular resistance  [PVR]);  and  Quality  of  Life  (measured  by  the  Short  Form  Health  Survey  (SF-36),  the EuroQOL 5-Dimensions and patient overall preference assessment at the end of treatment).

Sample size

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Assuming a treatment effect for sildenafil of 55 metres over placebo and a standard deviation of 75 metres, a sample size of 60 subjects per treatment group was required to detect this difference with 90% power at a one-sided significance level of 0.005 (which corresponds to a two-sided significance level of 0.01).

## Randomisation

Subjects  were  randomised  to  one  of  the  4  treatment  groups  in  a  1:1:1:1  ratio.  The  following  2 stratification factors were used: Aetiology of PAH (PPH, PAH secondary to connective tissue disease, PAH  with  surgical  repair)  and  Baseline  exercise  capacity  (&lt;325m, ≥ 325m).  The  main  reason  to include a covariate in the analysis was the existence of a strong or moderate association between the covariate and the primary outcome measure.

## Statistical methods

The  primary  endpoint  was  evaluated  using  a  one-sided  sequential  step-down  testing  procedure  in which the mean response in each sildenafil dose group was compared to that in the placebo group in a step-down fashion. First the highest dose group (80 mg TID) of sildenafil was compared to placebo. If no significant benefit was achieved, no further tests were to be carried out. If a significant benefit was achieved, then the next dose group (40 mg TID) was compared to placebo. Similarly, the 20 mg dose group was only compared to placebo if a significant benefit was achieved for the 40 mg group. All the pairwise comparisons described above were carried out at the pre-specified one-sided alpha level of 0.005 (which corresponds to a two-sided alpha of 0.01). The primary analysis was carried out using a two-sample t -statistic,  stratified  for  baseline  walking  distance  and  aetiology  for  the  ITT  and  PP populations. In the ITT (Intent-to-treat) analysis, subject with a missing Week 12, 6-Minute Walk Test had  an  assessment  imputed  using  the  LOCF.  Normality  of  the  primary  endpoint  was  investigated graphically for both the ITT and PP (per protocol) populations.

Secondary  endpoints  were  subjected  to  statistical  testing  in  a  hierarchical  order  as  follows:  mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), time to clinical worsening and BORG dyspnoea score.

Mean PAP was evaluated using a stratified t-test, time to clinical worsening was evaluated using a stratified log-rank test and BORG dyspnoea score was evaluated using a stratified Wilcoxon test. The stratification factors for each analysis were baseline walking distance and aetiology (as specified for the primary endpoint). All pairwise comparisons within each secondary endpoint were performed at the one-sided alpha level of 0.025.

## RESULTS

A total of 360 subjects were screened, there were 82 screen failures Two hundred and seventy eight subjects (278) were randomised to receive placebo (70 patients), sildenafil 20mg (69 patients), 40mg (68 patients) or 80mg (71 patients) TID; one subject randomised to receive sildenafil 40mg did not receive treatment. 277 randomised subjects took at least one dose of study medication.

The number of patients who discontinued the study prematurely was similar in each treatment arm: placebo  (2.86%),  20  mg  sildenafil  TID  (2.9%),  40  mg  sildenafil  TID  (3%),  80  mg  sildenafil  TID (8.5%). Of the 12 patients who discontinued prematurely, the greatest number withdrew due to AE not related to treatment (1.44%).

## Baseline data

All 4 treatment groups had a comparable composition regarding primary diagnosis and demographic characteristics.  Overall,  a  majority  of  patients  was  female  (n=209,  75%)  and  had  primary  PAH (n=175,  63%)  or  CTD-associated  PAH  (n=84,  30%).  Patients  with  surgical  repair-associated  PAH merely  represented  6%  of  the  population.  Most  patients  had  WHO  functional  class  III  (58%)  or  II (39%),  while  patients  in  WHO  class  I  and  IV  (0.4%  and  3%,  respectively)  were  very  poorly represented in the ITT sample. The mean baseline walking distance approximated 345 meters.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Primary Endpoint

The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the change from baseline in exercise capacity at Week 12 as measured by distance walked in six minutes.

Mean placebo-corrected treatment effects of 45.3 metres (99% CI: 20.5, 70), 46.1 metres (99% CI: 19.9, 72.4) and 49.7 metres (99% CI: 22.9, 76.5), were seen in favour of sildenafil 20 mg (P &lt;0.0001), sildenafil 40 mg (P &lt;0.0001), and sildenafil 80 mg (P&lt;0.0001), respectively. A 'sensitivity analysis' was carried out on all randomised and treated subjects in which subjects who did not have any postbaseline 6-Minute Walk test assessments and subjects who died during the study had their 6-Minute Walk test distance at Week 12 set to the baseline result, whilst all other subjects used their Week 12 6-Minute Walk test or had their last observation carried forward. Results are presented in the figure and tables below:

The  primary  ITT  analysis  showed  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  mean  placebocorrected sildenafil treatment effect on the 6-Minute Walk Test distance of 45-50 meters in all active treatment  groups.  The  results  from  a  'sensitivity  analysis'  (n=270)  and  the  per  protocol  population analysis (n=161) both confirmed the results on the aforementioned ITT analysis.

The largest part of the treatment effect was already seen at Week 4 after randomisation, after which a lesser  increase  was  noted  up  to  Week  12,  indicating  the  absence  of  medium-term  pharmacological tolerance.

## Secondary endpoints

Subjects on all sildenafil doses achieved a statistically significant reduction in mean PAP compared to those on placebo. The baseline mean PAP was 53 mmHg, and the change from baseline in mean PAP was -2.1 mmHg at the proposed sildenafil dose of 20mg TID and there was some evidence for a dosedependent decrease in mean PAP.

A statistically insignificant decreased incidence of 'clinical worsening events' in the active treatment groups  as  compared  to  placebo  was  obtained  (see  table  below),  primarily  driven  by  reduced hospitalisations (7% with 80 mg, 3% with 40 mg, 4% with 20 mg and 10% with placebo).

* Subjects who had  more than one clinical worsening event were counted separately under each type of event they experienced (but the total number only counted  subjects once, irrespective of the number of events they had).

Since  no  statistically  significant  treatment  benefit  was  observed  in  time  to  clinical  worsening, statistical testing was not carried out on BORG dyspnoea score.

The percentage of subjects on each of the sildenafil doses that showed an improvement of at least one functional  class  over  the  12-week  period  was  greater  compared  to  placebo  (42%  with  80  mg,  36% with 40 mg, 28% with 20 mg and 7% with placebo).

## Ancillary analyses

Results  were  generally  consistent  in  subgroups  according  to  baseline  walking  distance,  aetiology (primary  and  CTD-associated  PAH),  gender,  race,  location,  mean  PAP  and  PVRI.  There  was  a suggestion of an effect modification with age, in a sense that elderly patients appeared to experience a lesser improvement in exercise capacity.

## · Supportive study

A large majority of patients randomised in the pivotal trial A1481140 was subsequently included in extension study A1481142 (n=259), in which patients were titrated to sildenafil 80mg TID if tolerated. Alternative PAH therapy was permitted (e.g. epoprostenol, iloprost), except bosentan. A majority of patients (94%) reached a final dose of 80mg TID, indicating that the high dose was reasonably well tolerated. Subjects who received placebo in study A1481140 and reached a dose of 80mg TID at Week 24, showed a mean increase from baseline of 46 meters in 6-Minute Walk Test distance at Week 24, which  is  comparable  to  the  improvement  seen  in  the  sildenafil  20-80  mg  TID  dose  groups  from baseline to Week 12 in study A1481140 (i.e., 41-47 m). In agreement with this, subjects randomised to sildenafil 20-80mg TID in study A1481140 who received a dose of 80mg TID at Week 24, had a mean increase from baseline to Week 24 in 6-Minute Walk Test distance of approximately 50 meters.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

Pivotal study A1481140 was a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study with three sildenafil dose levels (20, 40 and 80 mg TID) and placebo in patients with PAH (n=277).

Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, only patients with idiopathic PAH, PAH with CTD, and PAH with surgical repair entered in the study. Consistent with the accepted definition of pulmonary hypertension, a mean resting PAP &gt;25 mmHg was required. In view of the potential clinically relevant dose range of 20-40mg TID derived from the PD studies A1481024 and 148-207, the dose of 80mg TID seems unnecessarily high from an efficacy point of view, but could yield valuable safety data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The 6-Minute Walk Test (primary endpoint) is the most widely used test to assess exercise capacity in PAH trials. The primary ITT analysis showed a statistically significant and clinically relevant mean placebo-corrected sildenafil treatment effect on the 6-Minute Walk Test distance of 45-50 meters in all active  treatment  groups.  The  results  from  a  'sensitivity  analysis'  and  the  per  protocol  population analysis  both  confirmed  the  results  on  of  the  analysis.  The  largest  part  of  the  treatment  effect  was already seen at Week 4 after randomisation, after which a lesser increase was noted up to Week 12, indicating  the  absence  of  medium-term  pharmacological  tolerance.  No  substantially  increased treatment effect beyond a sildenafil dose of 20mg TID was obtained regarding the primary endpoint. The  selected  dose  range  therefore  yielded  efficacy  results  on  the  higher  end  of  the  dose-response curve. As no data are available at a sildenafil dose range below 20mg TID, the lowest effective dose in PAH patients remains unknown.

There  was  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  mean  PAP  compared  to  those  on  placebo  (-2.1 mmHg) at the proposed sildenafil dose of 20mg TID. There was some evidence for a dose-dependent decrease in mean PAP, but this was not reflected in a dose-dependent increase in exercise tolerance, as judged  from  the  ITT  analysis  on  the  primary  study  endpoint.  There  was  no  clear  evidence  that sildenafil 20-80mg TID reduced the level of dyspnoea in patients with PAH.

The  study  duration  of  12  weeks  is  considered  sufficient  to  provide  efficacy  results  of  clinical relevance, but the demonstration of long-term efficacy would require considerably longer treatment duration.

Regarding  patients  in  WHO  class  II,  the  pivotal  trial  likely  included  mainly  severe  class  II  cases, which may not be representative of functional class II population in clinical practice.

The wording of the indication was revised to reflect the studied population considering that different responses  to  sildenafil  could  be  anticipated  depending  on  disease  severity  (as  reflected  in  WHO functional classification) and/or aetiology.

Data from the extension study further indicated that a sildenafil dose range of 20-80 mg TID is at the higher end of the dose-response curve and that a sildenafil dose level of 80mg TID is associated with a 6-month  sustained  improvement  of  ~50  meters.  However,  no  placebo  or  active  control  arm  was included  in  this  open-label  extension  study,  precluding  firm  conclusions  on  the  maintenance  of efficacy after 12 weeks of treatment.

## Clinical safety

- Patient exposure

The main sources of safety data are derived from patients with PAH and hypertension treated with sildenafil 20, 40 and/or 80mg TID chronically in phase 2/3 studies. A total of 277 patients with PAH (70 placebo, 207 received sildenafil) were enrolled in the 12-week pivotal study A1481140; 259 of these 277 patients (94%) were subsequently enrolled in the ongoing open extension study A1491142 in which all patients were titrated to 80mg TID if tolerated. Given the proposed fixed sildenafil dosage of 20mg TID, these data yielded a considerable safety margin. At the time of the data cut of July 2004, the total patient exposure was 5 times higher in the extension compared to the pivotal study (236.2 vs. 47.8 pt-years, respectively) and a total of 149 out of 274 (54%) patients had been treated for ≥ 1 year, almost exclusively driven by patients titrated at 80mg TID.

Another main source of safety data are the 199 patients (60 placebo, 139 sildenafil) treated in the 4week hypertension study A1481165.

No head-to-head comparison with active comparators has been made, precluding a direct comparison of the safety of sildenafil versus other PAH treatments such as bosentan.

- Adverse events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The overall proportion of subjects with common adverse events (AEs) in pivotal study A1481140 was similar across all treatment groups including placebo (~90%), which was also true for the proportion of subjects with severe AEs (~17%) and the number of AEs normalised to patient exposure.

Frequently encountered common AEs reported more often by sildenafil compared to placebo-treated patients included headache (45.9% vs. 38.6%, resp), flushing (11.6% vs. 4.3%), back pain (11.6% vs. 11.4%), dyspepsia (11.1% vs. 7.1%), diarrhoea (10.1% vs. 5.7%), pain in the limb (10.1% vs. 5.7%) and myalgia (9.2% vs. 4.3%). A markedly higher (difference &gt;5%) incidence with sildenafil compared to  placebo  was  observed  for  headache,  flushing  and  epistaxis  (6.8%  vs.  1.4%).  The  incidence  of individual severe AEs was below 3% in each sildenafil treatment group.

Myalgia,  peripheral  oedema,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  and  visual  disturbance  showed  some dose-dependency.

Several of these common AEs are already known to occur with sildenafil treatment in MED, but the rates  are  generally  lower  in  MED  patients  on  25-100mg  (as  needed)  compared  to  these  chronically treated PAH patients on higher daily dosages.

Importantly,  the  disease-related  severe  AEs  right  ventricular  failure,  exacerbated  dyspnoea  and aggravated  pulmonary  hypertension  were  less  frequently  encountered  in  sildenafil  compared  to placebo.

In the extension study, the incidence of common and severe AEs increased compared to the pivotal study,  but  the  rates  normalised  to  sildenafil  exposure  were  comparable  or  lower  in  the  extension versus pivotal study, suggesting no excess AEs to develop during long-term sildenafil exposure. The incidences  of  the  most  frequently  occurring  severe  AEs  right  ventricular  failure  and  aggravated pulmonary hypertension in the extension study, compared favourably with the placebo group in the pivotal study (~3.3% vs. 4.3%, resp).

No cases of priapism were noted in either study.

In the healthier population of the hypertension study, differences in common AE incidences between sildenafil  20-80mg  TID  and  placebo  were  more  marked,  but  also  concerned  known  sildenafilassociated AEs such as headache, flushing and dyspepsia.

- Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Serious adverse events

In the pivotal study, the overall incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) on sildenafil was lower as compared  to  placebo  (14%  vs.  18%,  respectively),  while  no  dose-dependency  was  noted  in  the sildenafil group.

Five SAEs occurred more frequently in sildenafil-treated patients compared to placebo: septic shock, upper respiratory tract infection, asthenia, oedema, and pyrexia at a frequency of 1% each.

The SAEs that occurred more frequently with placebo were pulmonary hypertension, chest pain, right ventricular  failure,  dyspnoea,  cardiac  failure  and  pneumonia.  In  contrast  to  the  SAEs  noted  more frequently  with  sildenafil,  most  of  the  SAEs  occurring  more  frequently  with  placebo  are  directly reflective of the progression of the underlying cardiopulmonary disease. Such a pattern was also noted for  severe  AEs  (see  above),  and  provides  some  reassurance  regarding  the  cardiovascular  safety  of sildenafil in PAH patients.

In the extension study, the most frequently reported SAEs on sildenafil were right ventricular failure (5.0%),  pulmonary  hypertension  (3.9%),  and  dyspnoea  (3.9%).  Similar  to  the  common  and  severe AEs, these SAE incidences are higher as compared those noted in the pivotal study, but the rates per patient-year of exposure were rather comparable in the extension and pivotal study, again indicating

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

no  excess  to  develop  during  long-term  exposure.  These  data  should  however  be  interpreted  with caution due to the limited number of patients treated with sildenafil for ≥ 1 year (n=149).

## Deaths

The incidence of death in the pivotal study was similar in the placebo and the combined sildenafil group (1.4%), while no deaths were considered to be treatment related. The mortality rates normalised to exposure during the pivotal study or within 40 days of discontinuing this study, were comparable between  sildenafil and placebo: 6.3 vs. 6.1 per 100 pt-years, resp. Across the pivotal and extension studies,  most  deaths  were  related  to  cardiopulmonary  causes.  In  line  with  the  results  on  SAEs,  the proportion of patients that died in the  extension study (15/259 = 5.8%) was considerably higher as compared to pivotal study. However, up to the data cutoff, the rate of death in the extension study or within  40  days  of  discontinuing  the  study  was  5.9  per  100  pt-years  and  thereby  comparable  to  the exposure normalised rate in the pivotal study. Thus, within the limitations posed by the low extent of sildenafil exposure and the infrequent nature of SAEs and death, it would appear as if no excess SAEs or  deaths  developed  during  long-term  sildenafil  exposure  in  the  extension  study  compared  to  the medium-term exposure in the pivotal study, while a comparable death rate and a lower overall SAE rate was noted with sildenafil versus placebo in the pivotal study.

No deaths occurred in the short-term hypertension study.

## Visual symptoms

Dose-dependent abnormal vision was observed with Viagra and is thought to be due to the effect of sildenafil on the PDE6 enzyme of retinal photoreceptors. In 2002, two meta-analyses reported that no consistent  pattern  had  emerged  to  suggest  any  structural  alterations  to  the  visual  system  with  longterm prn (as needed) dosing in MED patients.

In the chronic dosing pivotal PAH study, the most frequently encountered visual AEs with sildenafil were  visual  disturbance  (3.9%),  blurred  vision  (4.3%)  and  chromatopsia  (2.4%),  of  which  visual disturbance and chromatopsia were more frequently observed with sildenafil compared to placebo and showed  some  dose-dependency.  This  pattern  of  ophthalmic  AEs  bears  similarities  with  Viagra. Blurred  vision  was  also  frequently  reported  in  the  placebo  group  (5.7%),  suggesting  a  relationship with underlying pathology. In the extension study, the most frequently encountered ophthalmic AEs were blurred vision, visual disturbance, retinal haemorrhage, conjunctival- and episcleral hyperaemia, of which the latter two may be related to vasodilatation due to PDE5 inhibition. The incidences for ophthalmic  AEs  were  higher  in  the  extension  study  compared  to  the  pivotal  study,  while  the  rates normalised  to  exposure  were  consistently  lower  in  the  extension  versus  the  pivotal  study  (visual disturbance  0.06  vs.  0.17,  blurred  vision  0.09  vs.  0.19  events  per  pt-year  of  exposure,  resp),  again suggesting no excess ophthalmic AEs to develop during long-term exposure. No discontinuations were primarily  due  to  ophthalmic  symptoms,  but  ophthalmic  symptoms  were  part  of  a  symptom  array leading to discontinuation in two patients.

Regarding the subjective performance tests on visual acuity, visual fields and contrast sensitivity in the pivotal study, the proportion of patients with deterioration from baseline was generally comparable in the 3 sildenafil treatment groups as compared to the placebo group at Week 12, while the proportion of patients with deterioration from study A1481140 baseline remained stable between Week 12 and 24. The Farnsworth Munsell D-15 tests did not indicate that sildenafil causes a specific colour vision defect at dosages up to 80mg TID in patients with PAH. Colour vision results obtained with a larger single dose of sildenafil (100 mg) in healthy volunteers have been incorporated in the SPC (section 5.1).

To  date,  no  cases  of  non-arteritic  ischaemic  optic  neuropathy  (NAION)  have  been  reported  with sildenafil  treatment  in  patients  with  PAH.  Given  the  fact  that  series  of  case  reports  on  NAION occurring in temporal relationship with the use of sildenafil in MED patients with atherosclerotic risk factors  have  been  published  in  medical  literature  (Pomeranz  et  al.  2005;  Howard  et  al.  2005),  this serious adverse event should be specifically addressed in the Risk Management Plan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Bleeding events

In  the  pivotal  study,  the  overall  incidence  of  bleeding  events  was  comparable  in  the  combined sildenafil and placebo group, but epistaxis was markedly more frequently noted in the sildenafil group compared to the placebo group (6.8% vs. 1.4%, resp). This increase was particularly evident in the CTD subpopulation. Most epistaxis events were of mild severity and self-limiting, while all events resolved.  Also,  an  increased  incidence  of  ophthalmic  haemorrhage  (retinal-,  eye-,  and  conjunctival haemorrhage combined) was noted in sildenafil treated patients compared to placebo treated patients (3.9%  vs.  1.4%,  resp),  without  evidence  for  dose-dependency.  Further  analysis  of  these  bleeding events, showed that these predominantly occurred in patients using concomitant vitamin K antagonists with  a  higher  overall  incidence  in  the  sildenafil  treatment  group  compared  to  placebo  (20.3%  vs. 12.5%, resp). In patients not using vitamin K antagonists, a lower frequency in the sildenafil versus placebo  patients  was  noted.  Two  SAEs  were  reported  in  association  with  bleeding  events  during sildenafil treatment (epistaxis and hemorrhagic gastritis). In the extension study, the overall incidence of  bleeding  AEs  was  higher  compared  to  the  pivotal  study  (41%  vs.  16%,  resp)  and  also  showed predominance of the AEs epistaxis (8.5%) and ophthalmic haemorrhage (8.8%). However, the rates normalised to patient exposure were lower in the extension versus pivotal study regarding epistaxis (0.09 vs. 0.29 per patient-year, respectively) and ophthalmic haemorrhage (0.10 vs. 0.15 per patientyear,  respectively).  As  of  September  2004,  12  patients  (4.6%)  have  reported  a  total  of  14  SAEs  of bleeding in the extension study, most frequently haemoptysis and menorrhagia associated with the use of concomitant vitamin K antagonists.

## · Laboratory findings

In  the  pivotal  study,  the  number  of  patients  with  abnormal  test  results  (normal  baseline)  was comparable  in  each  treatment  group.  The  most  frequently  observed  abnormalities  during  the  study were  decreased  lymphocytes  and  elevated  total  neutrophils,  basophils  and  monocytes  across  all treatment  groups  including  placebo.  Liver  function  tests,  creatinine,  and  electrolytes  showed  no apparent differences between the active treatment groups and placebo. In the extension study, again the most  frequently  noted  abnormalities  related  to  decreased  lymphocytes  and  elevated  total neutrophils, basophils and monocytes. The clinical relevance of these particular findings is unclear, but  appears  to  be  limited  as  no  sildenafil-treated  patient  discontinued  after  randomisation  due  to  a laboratory adverse event.

## · Safety in special populations

Sildenafil-treated CTD patients reported more common AEs and SAEs compared to sildenafil treated PPH patients, suggesting a somewhat unfavourable impact of CTD aetiology on the sildenafil safety profile.  The  presence  of  hepatic  impairment  had  a  mild  negative  influence  on  the  safety  profile  of sildenafil and placebo, but the low number of patients in the sildenafil group (n=17) precludes drawing any firm conclusions. No meaningful assessment of safety in PAH patients with renal insufficiency could be performed (n=3). Regarding gender, it appeared that females were more likely to experience AEs compared to male patients during sildenafil  treatment,  but  AE  rates  in  placebo  and  sildenafiltreated  females  were  rather  similar.  There  was  no  clear  impact  of  age  on  the  safety  profile  of sildenafil,  although  the  low  number  of  elderly  patients  treated  with  sildenafil  (n=39)  once  again precludes  drawing  any  conclusions.  Given  the  low  numbers  of  patients  aged ≥ 65  years,  a  safety analysis for very elderly patients ( ≥ 75 years) was not expected to yield meaningful information.

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

See sections ' Pharmacodynamic interactions ' and ' Bleeding events '

- Discontinuation due to adverse events

In the pivotal study, discontinuation rates were low and similar in the placebo and sildenafil 20mg TID group (2.9%), but progressively higher with sildenafil 40 and 80mg TID (4.5% and 8.5%, resp). A total of 37 patients (14%) discontinued during the subsequent extension study, representing a lower

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sildenafil discontinuation rate normalised to exposure in the extension versus pivotal study (0.16 vs. 0.23  per  pt-year,  resp).  A  substantial  proportion  of  these  discontinued  due  to  death.  Most  other discontinuations were related to AEs, without any predominate cause.

## · Post marketing experience

Relevant Viagra data are discussed in previous sections

- Discussion on clinical safety

The most commonly reported adverse reactions that occurred (greater or equal to 10 %) on Revatio compared to placebo were headache, flushing, dyspepsia, back pain, diarrhoea and limb pain. As for Viagra, eye disorders were reported.

The poor prognosis of the disease and the lack of a control group make it difficult to draw conclusions about the causality of deaths in the extension study. An exploratory 1-year sildenafil survival analysis with  historical  comparisons  in  the  subset  of  PPH  patients  only,  suggested  that  mortality  rates  with sildenafil are in line bosentan and epoprostenol, thereby not posing a safety concern. However, further data are necessary.

Overall, data indicate that sildenafil increases the risk of bleeding events, but only in the presence of concomitant vitamin K antagonists, which are frequently used by PAH patients. The observed events of epistaxis may be related to enhanced blood flow to the nasal turbinates during sildenafil treatment. The exact underlying mechanism regarding ophthalmic bleeding with sildenafil is less clear, but may be related to vasodilatation as well. No interactions were seen between sildenafil and anticoagulants in the  MED development program. In the  absence  of  a  clear  mechanistic  explanation,  no  reassurance exists  that  this  apparently  increased  bleeding  tendency  would  not  extend  to  more  serious  bleeding events such as cerebrovascular haemorrhage. Given the infrequent nature of serious bleeding events and  the  limited  number  of  sildenafil-treated  CTD  patients  included  in  the  studies  (n=62),  the  trial programme could be expected to lack statistical power for elucidating clinically important differences in serious bleeding events. 'Epistaxis and other bleeding events' is therefore defined as a safety risk in the Risk Management Plan.

To address safety risks, a Risk Management Plan is planned.

Epistaxis  and  other  bleeding  events,  cardiovascular  safety,  hypotension,  long-term  mortality,  ocular safety  (including  NAION),  safety  data  in  PAH  patients  co-prescribed  sildenafil  with  approved therapies  (e.g.  epoprostenol  or  bosentan),  and  data  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment,  in  the paediatric population and in pregnant women have been defined as clinical safety specifications i.e. potential risks or missing data. As part of Non-clinical safety specifications, the need for further nonclinical  studies  to  gather  information  about  the  underlying  mechanisms  for  which  sildenafil  may produce NAION and other vascular and non-vascular effects in the eye, will be evaluated.

Planned  actions  mainly  consist  of  enhanced  pharmacovigilance  and  safety  assessment  in  ongoing (extension  studies  A1481142  [sildenafil  only]  and  A1481153[sildenafil-epoprostenol])  and  planned clinical  studies  (co-adminstration with bosentan). In addition, a natural history study is proposed to better understand  the natural history  of  bleeding  in  the  PAH  population.  For  the  enhanced pharmacovigilance, PSUR is listed as milestone.

Data on interactions should be obtained through the safety and efficacy study of the co-administration of sildenafil and bosentan.

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Sildenafil is an inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Pharmacodynamic data suggested that it could relax pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, prevent in  the  presence  of  NO  platelet-based  obstructions  to  blood  flow  and  relax  peripheral  blood vessels.  Several  possible  adverse  events  (vasodilatation,  antidiuretic  effect,  haemorrhagic  risk, inhibition of gastric emptying and visual disorder) can be associated with the use of sildenafil in view of its pharmacological profile.

## Efficacy

Based on the pivotal trial, sildenafil has shown a statistically significant effect on exercise capacity (placebo  corrected  improvement  of  exercise  capacity  of  45.3  meters  with  sildenafil  20  mg  TID)  in patients  treated  over  12  weeks.  Consistent  with  this  the  percentage  of  subjects  on  sildenafil  who reached an improvement of at least one functional class was greater than with placebo. The effect was not clearly shown to be dose-dependent.

The effect of sildenafil on other variables, including survival and clinical variables (e.g. dyspnoea) are limited and only considered descriptive. Further data will be expected on mortality.

## Safety

In general, sildenafil seems to be well tolerated in PAH patients having a safety profile consistent with that of sildenafil in the MED population.

Nevertheless, several potential risks or missing data should be further assessed in a risk management plan;  they  include  bleeding  events,  cardiovascular  safety,  long-term  mortality,  ocular  safety,  coadministration with other PAH treatments.

## Benefit/risk assessment

In  a  population  of  patients  with  idiopathic  and  CTD-associated  PAH  treated  with  conventional therapy, sildenafil 20mg TID has been shown to yield a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in exercise capacity, as reflected in a mean placebo-corrected improvement in 6-Minute Walk  Test  distance  of  approximately  45  meters  after  12  weeks.  It  is  of  note  that  no  head-to-head comparison  with  other  PAH  treatments  such  as  bosentan  and  iloprost  has  been  made,  and  that  no (placebo-controlled) data are currently available on main clinical endpoints showing the efficacy of sildenafil op top of these non-conventional PAH treatments.

The limited amount of patients included in clinical trial programme for this orphan drug application, mainly  impacts  on  the  safety  assessment  as  these  studies  had  low  power  to  elucidate  potential clinically relevant differences in the occurrence of less frequent events, such as serious adverse events and deaths. Although the rates of death and serious adverse events with sildenafil relative to placebo raised no safety concern, an effect of mortality has not been established. The poor prognosis of the disease and the lack of a control group make it difficult to draw conclusions on the causality of deaths observed in the long-term extension study. The applicant committed to provide further mortality data in the future on the basis of ongoing studies with discussion in the context of historical survival data.

Safety concerns exist regarding the occurrence of bleeding events and visual symptoms, both of which have been incorporated in the Risk Management Plan.

As stated earlier, a direct comparison with other non-conventional PAH treatments has not been made, but the improvement in exercise capacity obtained appears to be in line with other recently authorised PAH treatments.

In view of inconvenience with regard to safety and/or mode of administration of authorised products in  PAH,  the  benefit  risk  of  sildenafil  is  positive,  as  it  may  offer  physicians  a  valuable  alternative treatment option in this devastating, incurable condition.

Overall, considering that the indications for which Revatio is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence/data on the safety and efficacy,  Revatio  should  be  granted  a  marketing  authorisation  under  exceptional  circumstances. Further data on mortality and safety will have to be provided as specific obligations.

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The  claimed  indication  of  Revatio  significantly  overlaps  with  the  indications  granted  to  two  EU authorised  orphan  medicinal  products;  Tracleer  (bosentan)  and  Ventavis  (iloprost).  Considering however  that  both  the  principal  molecular  structural  feature  and  mechanism  of  action  of  sildenafil differ  from  those  of  both  bosentan  and  iloprost,  the  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  Revatio  does  not contain  a  similar  active  substance  (as  defined  in  Article  3  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No. 847/2000)  to  Tracleer  or  Ventavis,  and  thus  cannot  be  considered  to  be  similar  to  either  of  those medicinal products within the meaning of that Article 3.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the benefit/risk ratio of Revatio in the following indication: 'Treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class III, to improve exercise capacity. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with  connective  tissue  disease'  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances.

In addition, the CHMP, with reference to Article 8 of Regulation EC No 141/2000, considers Revatio not to be similar (as defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation EC No. 847/2000) to authorised orphan medicinal products for the same therapeutic indication.
