## Overview

On 7 October 1996, the European Commission granted a Community Marketing Authorisation valid throughout the European Union to Eli Lilly UK Ltd. for the medicinal product Olansek (olanzapine) indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. The Marketing Authorisation for Olansek was renewed on 20 November 2001. Olansek has never been marketed in the European Union.

On 24 January 2003, the Marketing Authorisation Holder notified the European Commission of its decision to voluntarily withdraw the Community Marketing Authorisation for Olansek for commercial reasons. On 17 March 2003, the European Commission adopted the decision withdrawing the Community Marketing Authorisation for the medicinal product for human use Olansek.

Pursuant to this decision the European Public Assessment Report for Olansek has been removed from this website.

For information, it should be noted that there are still two Community Marketing Authorisations valid throughout the European Union for medicinal products containing olanzapine, i.e. Zyprexa and Zyprexa Velotab from Eli Lilly Nederland B.V.
