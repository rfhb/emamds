CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Active immunisation against H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus. This  indication  is  based  on  immunogenicity  data  from  healthy  subjects  from  the  age  of  18  years onwards  following  administration  of  two  doses  of  the  vaccine  containing  A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1)-like strain (see section 5.1). Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics should be used in accordance with official recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Posology:

Adults and elderly (18 years of age and above):

One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date.

A second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks.

Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics has been evaluated in healthy adults (18-60 years of age) and healthy elderly (over 60 years  of  age)  following  a  1,  22  day  primary  vaccination  schedule,  and  booster  vaccination  (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).

There is limited experience in elderly over 70 years of age (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  event  of  an  officially  declared  influenza  pandemic  due  to  A/H5N1  virus,  persons  previously vaccinated  with  one  or  two  doses  of  Prepandemic  Influenza  vaccine  (H5N1) (surface  antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics that contained HA antigen derived from a different clade of the same influenza subtype as the influenza pandemic strain may receive a single dose of Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted)  Novartis  Vaccines  and  Diagnostics  instead  of  two  doses  that  are  required  in previously unvaccinated individuals (see section 5.1).

## Paediatric population:

The  safety  and  efficacy  of  Prepandemic  Influenza  vaccine  (H5N1)  (surface  antigen,  inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics in subjects under 18 years of age have not yet been established.  Currently  available  data  in  subjects  aged  6  months  to  18  years  of  age  are  described  in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. No data are available in children aged less than 6 months. Method of administration Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle. 4.3 Contraindications History of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues (egg  and  chicken  proteins,  ovalbumin,  kanamycin  and  neomycin  sulphate,  formaldehyde  and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)) of this vaccine. However, in a pandemic situation caused by the strain included in this vaccine, it may be appropriate to  give  this  vaccine  to  individuals  with  a  history  of  anaphylaxis  as  defined  above,  provided  that facilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Caution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients and to residues (eggs and chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)). Very  limited  data  in  subjects  with  co-morbidities,  including  immunocompromised  subjects  are available for this H5N1 vaccine. As  with  all  injectable  vaccines,  appropriate  medical  treatment  and  supervision  should  always  be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. Immunization shall be postponed in patients with febrile illness or acute infection. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The vaccine should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally.

There  are  no  data  with  Prepandemic  Influenza  vaccine  (H5N1)  (surface  antigen,  inactivated, adjuvanted)  Novartis  Vaccines  and  Diagnostics  using  the  subcutaneous  route.  Therefore,  healthcare providers  need  to  assess  the  benefits  and  potential  risks  of  administering  the  vaccine  in  individuals with  thrombocytopenia  or  any  bleeding  disorder  that  would  contraindicate  intramuscular  injection unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings.

Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Some cross-protection was observed against related H5N1 virus variants in clinical trials (see section 5.1).

Since a second dose is recommended, it should be noted that there are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics with other H5N1 monovalent vaccines.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Data  obtained  in  adults  showed  that  co-administration  of  adjuvanted  H5N1  vaccine  and  seasonal (inactivated  surface,  non-adjuvanted)  antigens  did  not  lead  to  any  interference  neither  for  seasonal strains nor for H5N1 strains.

It  is  estimated  that  more  than  90,000  women  have  been  vaccinated  during  pregnancy  with  H1N1v vaccine  Focetria  which  contains  the  same  amount  of  adjuvant  MF59C.1  as.  Prepandemic  Influenza vaccine (H5N1)  (surface  antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines  and  Diagnostics However information on outcomes is currently limited. Preliminary data from spontaneously reported events and ongoing post-marketing studies (pregnancy registry and prospective interventional study) do  not  suggest  direct  or  indirect  harmful  effects  on  influenza  vaccines  adjuvanted  with  MF59  with respect to pregnancy, fertility, embryonic/foetal development, parturition, or post natal development. Since Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics is expected not to be used in an emergency situation, its administration during pregnancy might be deferred as a precautionary approach.

SRH antibody response against an homologous H5N1 Vietnam strain at day 43 reached all CHMP criteria for all 3 strains. Co-administration  was  not  associated  with  higher  rates  of  local  or  systemic  reactions  compared  to administration  of  Prepandemic  Influenza  vaccine  (H5N1)  (surface  antigen,  inactivated,  adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics alone. Therefore the data indicate that Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics may be co-administered with non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines (with injections made into opposite limbs). There are no data on co-administration of Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics with other vaccines. If  co-administration  with  another  vaccine  is  considered,  immunisation  should  be  carried  out  on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. The  immunological  response  may  be  diminished  if  the  patient  is  undergoing  immunosuppressant treatment. Following influenza vaccination, false positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA method for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, HTLV-1. In such cases, the Western Blot method is negative. These transitory false positive results may be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation A study in rabbits did not indicate reproductive or developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Limited data was obtained from women who became pregnant during the course of clinical trials with Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics or H1N1v vaccines adjuvanted with MF59C.1. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Healthcare  providers  need  to  assess  the  benefit  and  potential  risks  of  administering  the  vaccine  to pregnant women taking into consideration official recommendations.

There  are  no  data  regarding  the  use  of  Prepandemic  Influenza  vaccine  (H5N1)  (surface  antigen, inactivated,  adjuvanted)  Novartis  Vaccines  and  Diagnostics  during  breast-feeding.  The  potential benefits to the mother and risks to the infant should be considered before administering Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics during breast-feeding.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Some of the undesirable effects mentioned under section 4.8 may affect the ability to drive or operate machinery.

Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness:

4.8 Undesirable effects Adverse reactions from clinical trials in adults (18 years old and above). The incidence of adverse reactions has been evaluated in six clinical trials involving approximately 4,000 adults and elderly receiving (Prepandemic  Influenza vaccine (H5N1)  (surface  antigen, inactivated,  adjuvanted)  Novartis  Vaccines  and  Diagnostics  at  least  7.5  µg  HA,  adjuvanted).  There were 3678 subjects 18-60 years of age, 264 subjects 61-70 years of age, and 41 subjects greater than 70 years of age. Consistent with the data observed by trial for solicited reactions, there was a general trend towards decreased reports of local reactions after the second vaccination compared with the first injection. Irrespective  of  antigen  dose,  almost  all  systemic  reactions  were  reported  on  the  day  of  vaccination (day 1) or during the 3 days immediately following. Data  on  safety  of  a  booster  dose  of  the  current  Prepandemic  Influenza  vaccine  (H5N1)  (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics formulation are limited to three trials (V87P1, V87P2 and V87P1E1) that included 116 adults and 56 elderly. No increase in reactions was reported when a booster dose is administered 6 months-18 months later after the initial dosing series.  A slight increase in reactions in adults was reported when a booster dose is administered 18 months after  the  initial  dosing  series.  In  the  elderly,  the  reported  reactions  increased  with  the  third booster dose only when compared with the second dose. The adverse reaction rates reported after either vaccination dose (i.e. 1 st , 2 nd or booster) were similar and are listed according to the following frequency: Very common ( ≥ 1/10) Common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10) Uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100) Rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000) Very rare (&lt;1/10,000) Medicinal product no longer authorised

Rare: anaphylaxis These side effects usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. Adverse reactions from clinical trial in children (6 months to 17 years old) (Study V87P6) Regardless  of  age,  reactogencity  was  higher  after  the  first  dose  than  after  the  second  vaccination. Reactogenicity after a third dose, administered 12 months following the first dose, was higher than after both first and second dose. The percentages of subjects reporting local reactions were higher in the older age groups, mainly due to the higher reports for pain. In toddlers erythema and tenderness were the most commonly reported solicited local reactions; irritability and unusual crying were the most commonly reported solicited systemic reactions. In children and adolescents pain was the most frequently  reported  solicited  local  reaction,  and  fatigue  and  headache  were  the  most  commonly reported solicited systemic reactions. Across all ages, low percentages of subjects reported fever. ≥ Medicinal product no longer authorised

This  section  describes  the  clinical  experience  with  Prepandemic  Influenza  vaccine  (H5N1)  (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics following a two-dose administration and booster. Immune response against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1): Adults (18-60 years) A clinical trial (Study V87P1) was conducted with a H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant in 312 healthy adults. Two doses of vaccine containing H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004; 7.5 µg HA/dose adjuvanted) were administered three weeks apart to 156 healthy adults. In another clinical trial (Study V87P13)  2693  adult  subjects  were  enrolled  and  received  two  doses  of  vaccine  containing  H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004; 7.5 µg HA/dose adjuvanted) administered three weeks apart. Immunogenicity was assessed in a subset (n=197) of study population. The seroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor** for anti-HA antibody to H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the adults measured by SRH assay was as follows: * measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm 2 ** geometric mean ratios of SRH Medicinal product no longer authorised

MN results against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 indicate a seroprotection and seroconversion rate ranging from 67% (60-74) to 85% (78-90) and 65% (58-72) to 83% (77-89), respectively. Immune response to vaccination assessed by MN assay is in line with results obtained with SRH.

Persistence of antibodies after primary vaccination in this population was assessed by HI, SRH, and MN  assays.  Compared  to  the  antibody  levels  obtained  at  day  43  after  completion  of  primary vaccination schedules, antibody levels at day 202 were reduced by 1/5 to 1/2 from their prior levels.

In a phase 2 clinical trial (Study V87P3) adult subjects aged 18-65 years primed 6-8 years previously with 2 doses of MF59-adjuvanted H5N3 vaccine /A/Duck/Singapore/97 were administered 2 booster

* measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm 2 ** geometric mean ratios of SRH MN results against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 indicate a seroprotection and seroconversion rate ranging from  of  57%  (50-64)  to  79%  (68-87)  and  55%  (48-62)  to  58%  (47-69)  respectively.  MN  results, similar to SRH results demonstrated strong immune response after completion of priming vaccination series in a population of elderly subjects. Persistence of antibodies after primary vaccination in this population as assessed by HI, SRH, and MN tests reduced from 1/2 to 1/5th of their post-vaccination level at day 202 as compared to day 43 after completion of primary schedules as assessed by HI, SRH, and MN tests. Up to 50% of the elderly subjects  immunised  with  Prepandemic  Influenza  vaccine  (H5N1)  (surface  antigen,  inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics were seroprotected at six months. A  third  (booster)  dose  of  Prepandemic  Influenza  vaccine  (H5N1)  (surface  antigen,  inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics was administered 6 months onwards after the primary vaccination.

## b) Long term booster immune memory

A  single  vaccination  with  Prepandemic  Influenza  vaccine  (H5N1)  (surface  antigen,  inactivated, adjuvanted)  Novartis  Vaccines  and  Diagnostics  (H5N1,  A/Vietnam/1194/2004)  induced  high  and rapid  serological  response  in  subjects  primed  6-8  years  previously  with  two  doses  of  a  different surrogate H5N vaccine, having same formulation as Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics but using the strain H5N3.

## c) Trial on different vaccination schedules:

In a clinical trial evaluating 4 different vaccination schedules in 240 subjects 18 to 60 years of age, where the second dose was after either 1, 2, 3 or 6 weeks after the first Prepandemic Influenza vaccine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(H5N1)  (surface  antigen,  inactivated,  adjuvanted)  Novartis  Vaccines  and  Diagnostics  dose,  SRH CHMP  criteria  were  achieved  in  all  the  vaccine  schedule  groups  after  3  weeks  from  the  2 nd vaccination. The magnitude of immune response was lower in the group who received the 2 nd dose 1 week later and higher in the groups with longer interval schedules.

## · Available data in paediatric populations

A clinical trial (Study V87P6) was conducted with a H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant in  471  children  from  6  months  to  17  years  of  age.  Two  doses  of  Prepandemic  Influenza  vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics were administered  three  weeks  apart  and  a  third  dose  12  months  following  the  first  dose.  After  3  weeks from the 2 nd vaccination (day 43) all age groups (i.e. 6-35 months, 3-8 years and 9-17 years) achieved high levels of antibodies to (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) as evaluated with SRH and HI assays as presented in table below*. In this trial no vaccine related SAEs were observed.

## Information from non-clinical trials

Efficacy against challenge with virus homologous and heterologous to vaccine strains was evaluated in the ferret model. Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis  Vaccines  and  Diagnostics  containing  HA  from  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  (homologous  to  the challenge  strain)  and  an  Prepandemic  Influenza  vaccine  (H5N1)  (surface  antigen,  inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics -like H5N1 vaccine, containing hemagglutinin from the A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005-like (heterologous to the challenge strain) were tested. Groups of 8 ferrets received one (day 21) or two (days 0 and 21) doses of vaccine containing 3.75 or 7.5 micrograms of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

antigen. Control animals received adjuvant alone. Animals were challenged by the intranasal route on day 42 with a lethal dose of A/Vietnam/1203/04 virus. Animals were monitored for 16-17 days after challenge to allow for a comprehensive assessment of disease progression, including the time of onset of symptoms, mortality, or subsequent recovery.

All  (100%)  animals  receiving  2  doses  of  Prepandemic  Influenza  vaccine  (H5N1)  (surface  antigen, inactivated,  adjuvanted)  Novartis  Vaccines  and  Diagnostics  were  protected,  and  94%  of  animals receiving  a  single  dose  of  Prepandemic  Influenza  vaccine  (H5N1)  (surface  antigen,  inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics were protected. 87% of animals challenged with virus heterologous  to  the  vaccine  strain  after  2  doses  of  vaccine  were  protected,  and  a  single  dose  of heterologous  vaccine  protected  56%  of  the  animals.  All  control  animals  died  within  7  days  of challenge. Vaccination protected animals from lethal challenge with virus homologous and heterologous to the vaccine.

In  a  similar  study,  intranasal  challenge  was  delayed  until  approximately  4  months  after  the  second dose of vaccine containing either 3.75 or 7.5 micrograms of antigen was administered. In this study 100% of animals were protected against homologous challenge, and 81% of animals were protected against  heterologous  challenge.  Vaccination  protected  animals  from  lethal  challenge  even  when  HI antibody titers were low or undetectable. Efficacy against challenge with the heterologous virus A/Indonesia/5/05 was also tested. Groups of 6 ferrets received one dose of vaccine (day 21) containing 3.75 micrograms of antigen or two doses of vaccine (days 0 and 21) containing either 1.0 or 3.75 micrograms of antigen (A/Vietnam/1194/2004). A  lethal  challenge  was  administered  by  the  intratracheal  route  on  day  49.  Two  doses  of  vaccine protected  92%  of  animals,  and  a  single  dose  of  vaccine  protected  50%  of  animals  against  the A/Indonesia/5/05  virus.  Compared  to  the  adjuvant  control  group,  lung  damage  was  reduced  in vaccinated  groups.  Viral  shedding  and  viral  titers  in  lungs  were  also  reduced,  suggesting  that vaccination may reduce the risk of viral transmission. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data obtained with Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted)  Novartis  Vaccines  and  Diagnostics  and  with  seasonal  influenza  vaccine  containing MF59C.1 adjuvant  reveal  no  special  hazard  for  humans  based  on  conventional  studies  of  repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, female fertility, and reproductive and developmental toxicity (through the end of the lactation period). 6.

## PSURs

PSUR  submission  when  Prepandemic  Influenza  vaccine  (H5N1)  (surface  antigen,  inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics is used during an influenza pandemic:

During a pandemic situation, the frequency of submission of periodic safety update reports specified in  Article  24  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  will  not  be  adequate  for  the  safety  monitoring  of  a pandemic vaccine for which high levels of exposure are expected within a short period of time. Such situation requires rapid notification of safety information that may have the greatest implications for risk-benefit balance in a pandemic. Prompt analysis of cumulative safety information, in light of extent of exposure, will be crucial for regulatory decisions and protection of the population to be vaccinated. In  addition,  duration  a  pandemic,  resources  needed  for  an  in-depth  evaluation  of  Periodic  Safety Update Reports in the format as defined in Volume 9a of the Rules Governing Medicinal Product in the European Union may not be adequate for a rapid identification of a new safety issue.

<!-- image -->

In consequence, as soon as the pandemic is declared and the prepandemic vaccine is used, the MAH shall  submit more frequent simplified periodic safety update reports with a format and a periodicity defined in the \"CHMP Recommendations for the Core Risk Management Plan for Influenza Vaccines prepared from viruses with the potential to cause a pandemic and intended for use outside of the core dossier context\" (EMEA/49993/2008), and any subsequent update. Official batch release: in accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, the official batch release will be undertaken by a state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose.

Pandemic flu is a type of influenza that occurs every few decades and which spreads rapidly around the  world.  The  symptoms  of  pandemic  flu  are  similar  to  those  of  an  ordinary  flu  but  may  be  more severe. When  a  person  is  given  the  vaccine,  the  immune  system  (the  body's  natural  defense  system)  will produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. As with all vaccines, Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated.

formaldehyde,  kanamycin  and  neomycin  sulphate  (antibiotics)  or  cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue.
