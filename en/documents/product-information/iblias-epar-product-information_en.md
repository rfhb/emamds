## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). Iblias can be used for all age groups.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia. Posology The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition. The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma). One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one mL of normal human plasma. On Demand Treatment The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5% to 2.5% of normal activity. The required dose is determined using the following formulae: Required units = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% or IU/dL) x reciprocal of observed recovery (i.e. 0.5 for recovery of 2.0%). The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be targeted to the clinical effectiveness required in the individual case. In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in % of normal) in the corresponding period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 1: Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery

Prophylaxis For long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses for adolescents ( ≥ 12 years age) and adult patients are 20 to 40 IU of Iblias per kg body weight two to three times per week. In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary. Previously untreated patients The safety and efficacy of Iblias in previously untreated patients have not yet been established. Limited data are available. Paediatric population A safety and efficacy study has been performed in children of 0-12 years (see section 5.1); limited data are available for children below 1 year. The recommended prophylaxis doses are 20-50 IU/kg twice weekly, three times weekly or every other day according to individual requirements. For paediatric patients above the age of 12, the dose recommendations are the same as for adults. Method of administration Intravenous use. Iblias should be injected intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes depending on the total volume. The rate of administration should be determined by the patient's comfort level (maximal rate of infusion: 2 mL/min). For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and the package leaflet. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.3 Contraindications

-  Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
-  Known allergic reactions to mouse or hamster proteins.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Hypersensitivity

Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with Iblias. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue the use of the medicinal product immediately and contact their physician. Patients should be informed of  the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, nausea, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.

In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. Inhibitors The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per mL of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days. Cases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a previous history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients carefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch. The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre inhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. Cardiovascular events Haemophilic patients with cardiovascular risk factors or diseases may be at the same risk to develop cardiovascular events as non-haemophilic patients when clotting has been normalised by treatment with FVIII. Elevation of FVIII levels following administration, in particular in those with existing cardiovascular risk factors, might cause a patient to have the same risk for vessel closure or myocardial infarction as for the non-haemophilic population. Consequently, patients should be evaluated for cardiac risk factors. Catheter-related complications Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including local infections, bacteraemia  and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. These complications have not been associated with the product itself.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Documentation

It is strongly recommended that every time Iblias is administered to a patient, the name and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the medicinal product.

## Paediatric population

The listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children.

Sodium content For 250/500/1000 IU strength: After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.081 mmol sodium per vial of reconstituted solution (corresponding to 1.86 mg per vial). This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'sodium- free'. For 2000/3000 IU strength: After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.156 mmol sodium per vial of reconstituted solution (corresponding to 3.59 mg per vial). This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'sodium- free'. 4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interactions of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have been reported. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy is not available. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy only if clearly indicated. Breast feeding It is unknown whether Iblias is excreted in human milk. The excretion in animals has not been studied. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during breast-feeding only if clearly indicated. Fertility No animal fertility studies have been conducted with Iblias and its effect on human fertility has not been established in controlled clinical trials. Since Iblias is a replacement protein of endogenous factor VIII, no adverse effects on fertility are expected. Effects on ability to drive or use machines Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

If patients experience dizziness or other symptoms affecting their ability to concentrate and react, it is recommended that they do not drive or use machines until the reaction subsides.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing)  have been observed and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock).

Development of antibodies to mouse and hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions may occur.

Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated with factor VIII, including with IbliasIf such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihemorrhagics: blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code: B02BD02 Mechanism of action The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor (vWF) complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and vWF) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII binds to vWF in the patient's circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies. Iblias does not contain von Willebrand factor. Pharmacodynamic effects The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is prolonged in people with haemophilia. Determination of aPTT is a conventional in vitro assay for biological activity of factor VIII. Treatment with rFVIII normalizes the aPTT similar to that achieved with plasma-derived factor VIII. Clinical efficacy and safety Control and Prevention of Bleeding Two multi-center, open-label, cross-over, uncontrolled, randomized studies in previously treated adults/adolescents with severe haemophilia A (&lt; 1%) and one multicenter, open label, uncontrolled study in previously treated children &lt; 12 years with severe haemophilia A were conducted. A total of 204 subjects have been included in the clinical trial program, 153 subjects ≥ 12 years and 51 subjects &lt; 12 years. 140 subjects were treated for at least 12 months, and 55 of these subjects for a median of 24 months.

Repeated PK measurements after 6 to 12 months of prophylaxis treatment with Iblias did not indicate any relevant changes in PK characteristics after long-term treatment. In an international study involving 41 clinical laboratories, the performance of Iblias in FVIII:C assays was evaluated and compared to a marketed full length rFVIII product. Consistent results were determined for both products. The FVIII:C of Iblias can be measured in plasma with a one-stage coagulation assay as well as with a chromogenic assay using the routine methods of the laboratory. The analysis of all recorded incremental recoveries in previously treated patients demonstrated a median rise of &gt; 2% (&gt; 2 IU/dL) per IU/kg body weight for Iblias. This result is similar to the reported values for factor VIII derived from human plasma. There was no relevant change over the 6-12 months treatment period. Table 5: Phase III incremental recovery results 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special risk for humans based on safety pharmacology, in vitro genotoxicity, and short term repeat-dose toxicity studies. Repeat-dose toxicity studies longer than 5 days, reproductive toxicity studies, and carcinogenicity studies, have not been performed. Such studies are not considered meaningful due to the production of antibodies against the heterologous human protein in animals. (Also FVIII is an intrinsic protein and not known to cause any reproductive or carcinogenic effects.) 6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS 6.1 List of excipients Medicinal product no longer authorised

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects. Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you. -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What Iblias is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you use Iblias 3. How to use Iblias 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Iblias 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Iblias is and what it is used for Iblias is a medicine that contains the active substance human recombinant coagulation factor VIII, also called octocog alfa. Iblias is prepared by recombinant technology without addition of any human- or animal-derived components in the manufacturing process. Factor VIII is a protein naturally found in the blood that helps to clot it. Iblias is used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in adults, adolescents and children of all ages with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). 2. What you need to know before you use Iblias Do not use Iblias if you are allergic to octocog alfa or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6 and end of section 2).  if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Warnings and precautions Take special care with Iblias and talk to your doctor or pharmacist if :

-  you experience tightness in the chest, dizziness (including when you get up from sitting or lying down), hives, itchy rash (urticaria), wheezing, or feeling sick or faint. These may be signs of a

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rare severe sudden allergic reaction (an anaphylactic reaction) to Iblias. If this occurs, stop administering the product immediately and seek medical advice.

-  your bleeding is not being controlled with your usual dose of Iblias. The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with all Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If your or your child's bleeding is not being controlled with Iblias, tell your doctor immediately.
-  you have previously developed factor VIII inhibitors to a different product. If you switch factor VIII products, you may be at risk of your inhibitor coming back.

 you have been told you have heart disease or are at risk for heart disease.  you require a central venous access device (CVAD) for the administration of Iblias. You may be at  risk of CVAD-related complications including local infections, bacteria in the blood (bacteraemia) and the formation of a blood clot in the blood vessel (thrombosis) where the catheter is inserted. Other medicines and Iblias Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Children and adolescents The listed warnings and precautions apply to patients of all ages, adults and children. Pregnancy and  breast-feeding Experience with the use of factor VIII products during pregnancy and breast-feeding are not available since haemophilia A rarely occurs in women. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine. Iblias is not likely to affect the fertility in male or female patients, as the active substance is naturally occurring in the body. Driving and using machines If you experience dizziness or any other symptoms affecting your ability to concentrate and react, do not drive or use machines until the reaction subsides. Iblias contains sodium This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, and is therefore considered essentially 'sodium- free'. Documentation It is recommended that every time that you use Iblias, you note down name and batch number of the product. 3. How to use Iblias Treatment with Iblias will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with haemophilia A.Always use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatment of bleeding

Your doctor will calculate the dose of this medicine and how frequently you should use it to get the necessary level of factor VIII activity in your blood. The doctor should always adjust the dose and the frequency of administration according to your individual needs. How much Iblias you should use and how often you should use it depends on many factors such as:

-  your weight
-  the severity of your haemophilia
-  where the bleed is and how serious it is
-  whether you have inhibitors and how high the inhibitor titre is

 the factor VIII level that is needed. Prevention of bleeding If you are using Iblias to prevent bleeding (prophylaxis), your doctor will calculate the dose for you. This will usually be in the range of 20 to 40 IU of octocog alfa per kg of body weight, injected two or three times per week. However, in some cases, especially for younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary. Laboratory tests It is strongly recommended that appropriate laboratory tests be performed on your plasma at suitable intervals to ensure that adequate factor VIII levels have been reached and are maintained. For major surgery in particular, close monitoring of the replacement therapy by means of coagulation analysis must be carried out. Use in children and adolescents Iblias can be used in children of all ages. In children below the age of 12 higher doses or more frequent injections than in adults may be needed. Patients with inhibitors If you have been told by your doctor that you have developed factor VIII inhibitors you may need to use a larger dose of Iblias to control bleeding. If this dose does not control your bleeding your doctor may consider giving you another product. Speak to your doctor if you would like further information on this. Do not increase the dose of Iblias to control your bleeding without checking with  your doctor. Duration of treatment Your doctor will tell you how often and at what intervals this medicine is to be administered. Usually, treatment for haemophilia needs to be given throughout your life-time. How Iblias is given This medicine is intended for injection into a vein over 2 to 5 minutes depending on the total volume and your comfort level and should be used  within 3 hours after preparing the solution. How Iblias is prepared for administration Use only the items that are provided with each package of this medicine. If these components cannot be used, please contact your doctor. If any component of the package is opened or damaged, do not use it. You must filter the reconstituted product before administration to remove any possible particles  in the solution. You are filtering by using the Mix2Vial adapter. Medicinal product no longer authorised

This medicine must not be mixed with other infusion solutions. Do not use solutions containing visible particles or that are cloudy. Follow the directions given by your doctor closely and use the detailed instructions for reconstitution and administration provided at the end of this leaflet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you use more Iblias than you should

No cases of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported. If you have used more Iblias than you should, please tell your doctor.

## If you forget to use Iblias

- Administer your next dose immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your doctor.
- Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose .
-  trouble falling asleep

<!-- image -->

If you stop using Iblias Do not stop using Iblias without checking with your doctor. If you have any further questions regarding this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 4. Possible side effects Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most serious side effects are allergic reactions or anaphylactic shock (an uncommon, severe allergic reaction affecting blood pressure and breathing). If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, stop the injection/infusion immediately and speak to your doctor at once. Any of the following symptoms during injection/infusion can be an early warning for allergic and anaphylactic reactions:  chest tightness/general feeling of being unwell  dizziness  mild hypotension (mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing)  nausea For patients who have received previous treatment with Factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) inhibitor antibodies (see section 2) may form uncommonly (less than 1 in 100 patients). If this happens your medicine may stop working properly and you may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately. Other possible side effects: Common ( may affect up to 1 in 10 users):  lymph nodes enlarged (swelling under the skin of the neck, armpit or groin)  heart palpitations (feeling your heart beating hard, rapidly, or irregularly)  rapid heartbeat  stomach pain or discomfort  indigestion  fever  chest pain or discomfort  local reactions where you injected the medication (e.g. bleeding under the skin, intense itching, swelling, burning sensation, temporary redness)  headache  dizziness Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Scientific conclusions

Treatment of congenital haemophilia is currently based on prophylactic or on-demand replacement therapy with coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). FVIII replacement therapy can be generally categorised into two broad classes of products; plasma derived (pdFVIII) and recombinant (rFVIII) FVIII. A wide range of individual pdFVIII and rFVIII products are authorised for use in the European Union.

A major complication of FVIII therapy is the occurrence of IgG alloantibodies (inhibitors) that neutralise FVIII activity, causing loss of bleeding control. Treatment of patients who have developed inhibitors requires careful individual management and can be resistant to therapy.

In May 2016, an open-label, randomised controlled trial aimed at addressing the incidence of inhibitors between the two classes (pdFVIII vs. rFVIII products) was published in the New England Journal of Medicine 1 . This trial, known as the SIPPET study ('Survey of Inhibitors in Plasma-Product Exposed Toddlers') was conducted to evaluate the relative risk of inhibitors in patients treated with pdFVIII compared to rFVIII. It found that patients treated with rFVIII products had an 87% higher incidence of all inhibitors than those treated with pdFVIII (which contained VWF) (hazard ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.17 to 2.96).

Treatment with both pdFVIII and rFVIII can lead to development of inhibitors (tested with the Nijmegen method of the Bethesda assay and defined as ≥ 0.6 Bethesda units (BU) for 'a low titre' inhibitor and &gt;5 BU for a 'high-titre' inhibitor). The occurrence of inhibitor development in haemophilia A patients receiving FVIII products mostly occurs in previously-untreated patients (PUPs) or minimally treated patients (MTPs) who are still within the first 50 days of exposure (EDs) to the treatment. Inhibitors are less likely to occur in previously-treated patients (PTPs). The known risk factors for inhibitor development can be grouped into patient and treatment-related factors:  Patient-related risk factors include type of F8 gene mutation, severity of haemophilia, ethnicity, family history of inhibitor development and possibly HLA-DR (Human Leukocyte Antigen - antigen D Related) constitution.  Treatment-related factors include intensity of exposure, number of exposure days (EDs), on demand treatment posing a greater risk than prophylaxis, particularly in the context of danger signals such as trauma or surgery, and young age at first treatment poses a higher risk. Whether there are significant differences in the risk of inhibitor development between different types of FVIII replacement product remains an area of uncertainty. Differences between products in each FVIII class  and consequently differential risks between individual products, are biologically plausible. The pdFVIII class consists of products with or without Von Willebrand Factor (VWF), and those with VWF contain a range of VWF levels. Some experimental studies have suggested a role for VWF in protecting FVIII epitopes from recognition by the antigen-presenting cells, thereby reducing immunogenicity, although this remains theoretical. VWF is not present in rFVIII, but there is significant heterogeneity within the rFVIII class for instance due to the different manufacturing processes used, with a wide range of products from different manufacturers produced over the past 20 years. These different manufacturing processes (including the different cell lines used to engineer the rFVIII products) can in theory lead to differential immunogenicity.

On 6 July 2016 Paul-Ehrlich-Institut Germany initiated a referral under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC resulting from pharmacovigilance data, and requested the PRAC to assess the potential impact of the results of the SIPPET study on the marketing authorisations of relevant FVIII products and to issue a recommendation on whether these should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked and whether any risk minimisation measures should be implemented. The referral focuses on the risk of inhibitor development in PUPs.

Further to the recent publication on the SIPPET study, the MAHs were requested to assess the potential impact of the results of this study and other relevant safety data on inhibitor development in PUPs on the MA of their FVIII product including consideration on risk minimisation measures.

The lead authors of the SIPPET study were also invited to respond to a list of questions regarding the study methods and findings and to present their conclusions at the February 2017 PRAC plenary meeting. Information submitted by the lead authors of the SIPPET study during the course of the referral was also taken into consideration by PRAC in reaching its conclusion. Clinical discussion Published observational studies The responses of MAHs referred to a range of published observational studies (the CANAL, RODIN, FranceCoag, UKHCDO, amongst others) which have sought to evaluate any differential risks of inhibitor development between the classes of pdFVIII and rFVIII, as well as any differential risk of inhibitor development between products within the rFVIII class. These studies have yielded different results and suffer from the limitations of observational studies, and in particular from possible selection bias. The risk of inhibitor development is multifactorial (aside from any putative product-specific risk), and such studies have not always been able to collect information on relevant covariates and to adjust the analyses accordingly; residual confounding is inevitably a significant uncertainty. Furthermore, over time there have been changes in manufacturing process of individual products and changes in treatment regimens between centres, hence 'like for like' comparisons between products is not always possible. These factors make control of such studies and interpretation of the results challenging. The CANAL study 2  found no evidence of a class difference, including pdFVIII products with considerable quantities of von Willebrand factor; for 'clinically relevant' inhibitors the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.7 (95% CI 0.4-1.1), and for high titre inhibitors ( ≥ 5 BU) was 0.8 (95% CI 0.41.3). The RODIN/Pednet study 3  also found no evidence of a class difference in inhibitor risk between all pdFVIII vs all rFVIII; for 'clinically relevant' inhibitors the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.96 (95% CI 0.62-1.49), and for high titre inhibitors ( ≥ 5 BU/ml) was 0.95 (95% CI 0.56-1.61). However, the study found evidence of an increased risk of inhibitors (all and high titre) for 2 nd  generation rFVIII octocog alfa (Kogenate FS/Helixate NexGen) compared with 3 rd  generation rFVIII octocog alfa (which was driven solely by data for Advate). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Similar to RODIN/Pednet, the UKHCDO study found a significant increased risk of inhibitors (all and high titre) for Kogenate FS/Helixate NexGen (2 nd  generation rFVIII) compared to Advate (3 rd generation rFVIII). Although this became non-significant when UK patients (also included in the

RODIN/Pednet study were excluded. There was also evidence for an increased risk with Refacto AF (another 3 rd  generation rFVIII) vs Advate, but only for all inhibitor development. Like the UKHCDO study, the FranceCoag study also found no statistically significant increased risk for any rFVIII products vs Advate when French patients (also in the RODIN/Pednet study) were excluded.

Prior to the current referral, it was noted that PRAC had already considered the implications of the RODIN/Pednet, the UKHCDO and the FranceCoag studies for the EU marketing authorisations for FVIII products. In 2013, PRAC had concluded that the RODIN/Pednet findings were not sufficiently robust to support a conclusion that Kogenate FS/Helixate NexGen was associated with an increased risk of developing factor VIII inhibitors compared with other products. In 2016, PRAC had considered the findings of meta-analysis of all three studies (RODIN/Pednet, UKHCDO and FranceCoag studies), and again concluded that the currently available evidence does not confirm that Kogenate Bayer/Helixate NexGen is associated with an increased risk of factor VIII inhibitors, compared with other recombinant factor VIII products in PUPs.

MAH-sponsored studies The MAHs provided an analysis of low and high titre inhibitor development in PUPs with severe haemophilia A (FVIII &lt; 1%) from all clinical trials and observational studies conducted with their products, along with critical discussion on the limitations of these studies. The data came from a very wide range of heterogenous studies across products and over time. Many of these studies were small and not specifically designed to evaluate the inhibitor risk in PUPs with severe haemophilia A. The studies were mostly single arm and do not provide data to perform comparative analysis (either between pdFVIII and rFVIII as a class comparison, or within the rFVIII class). However, the general estimates of inhibitor rates from these studies for individual products are broadly in line with the findings from large observational studies. Of the larger and more relevant studies for pdFVIII products, inhibitor rates observed (often not stated if high or low titre) ranged from 3.5 to 33%, with most around 10-25%. However, in many cases little information was provided on the methods, patient populations and nature of the inhibitors to assess the information in the context of more recent published data. For most rFVIII products, newer and more relevant information from clinical trials in PUPs is available. Inhibitor rates in these studies range from 15 to 38% for all inhibitors and 9 to 22.6% for high titre inhibitors; i.e. within the range of 'very common'. The PRAC also considered interim results submitted by the MAHs from ongoing studies from CSL (CRD019\\_5001) and Bayer (Leopold KIDS, 13400, part B.). Furthermore, the PRAC examined clinical trials and the scientific literature for de novo inhibitors in PTPs. The analysis demonstrated that the frequency of inhibitor development is much lower in PTPs compared to PUPs. The available data showed that in many studies including the EUHASS registry (Iorio A, 2017 4 ; Fischer K, 2015 5 ) the frequency could be classified as 'uncommon'.

(plasma FVIII concentration&lt;1%) with either the use of pdFVIII or rFVIII concentrates. Eligible patients (&lt;6 years, male, severe haemophilia A, no previous treatment with any FVIII concentrate or only minimal treatment with blood components) were included from 42 sites. The primary and secondary outcomes assessed in the study were the incidence of all inhibitors ( ≥ 0.4 BU/ml) and the incidence of high-titre inhibitors ( ≥ 5 BU/ml), respectively.

Inhibitors developed in 76 patients, 50 of whom had high-titre inhibitors ( ≥ 5 BU). Inhibitors developed in 29 of the 125 patients treated with pdFVIII (20 patients had high-titre inhibitors) and in 47 of the 126 patients treated with rFVIII (30 patients had high-titre inhibitors). The cumulative incidence of all inhibitors was 26.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.4 to 35.2) with pdFVIII and 44.5% (95% CI, 34.7 to 54.3) with rFVIII; the cumulative incidence of high-titre inhibitors was 18.6% (95% CI, 11.2 to 26.0) and 28.4% (95% CI, 19.6 to 37.2), respectively. In Cox regression models for the primary end point of all inhibitors, rFVIII was associated with an 87% higher incidence than pdFVIII (hazard ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.17 to 2.96). This association was consistently observed in multivariable analysis. For high-titre inhibitors, the hazard ratio was 1.69 (95% CI, 0.96 to 2.98).



The SIPPET analysis does not allow for product-specific conclusions to be made as it relates only to a small number of certain FVIII products. The study was not designed and powered to generate sufficient product-specific data and, therefore, to draw any conclusions on the risk of inhibitor development for individual products. In particular, only 13 patients (10% of the FVIII arm) received a third generation rFVIII product. However, despite the lack of robust evidence to support differential risks between rFVIII products, differential risks cannot be excluded, as this is a heterogeneous product class with differences in composition and formulations. Therefore, there is a high degree of uncertainty around extrapolating the SIPPET findings to the entire rFVIII class, particularly for more recentlyauthorised rFVIII products which were not included in the SIPPET trial.

Ad hoc expert group meeting The PRAC considered the views expressed by experts during an ad-hoc meeting. The expert group was of the view that the relevant available data sources have been considered. The expert group suggested that further data are needed to establish if there are clinically relevant differences in frequency of inhibitor development between different factor VIII products and that, in principle, such data should be collected separately for individual products, as degree of immunogenicity will be difficult to generalise across the classes of products (i.e. recombinant vs. plasma-derived). The experts also agreed that the degree of immunogenicity of different products was adequately described overall with the amendments to the SmPC proposed by the PRAC highlighting the clinical relevance of inhibitor development (in particular low compared to high titre inhibitors), as well as the  frequency of 'very common' in PUPs and 'uncommon' in PTPs. The experts also suggested studies which could further characterise the immunogenic properties of the factor VIII medicinal products (e.g. mechanistic, observational studies). Discussion The PRAC considered that as a prospective randomised trial, the SIPPET study avoided many of the design limitations of the observational and registry-based studies undertaken so far to evaluate the risk of inhibitor development in PUPs. However the PRAC is of the view that there are uncertainties with regards to the findings of the SIPPET study which preclude the conclusion that there is a higher risk of inhibitor development in PUPs treated with rFVIII products than pdFVIII products studied in this clinical trial, as detailed below: Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  The SIPPET study has methodological limitations, with particular uncertainty around whether the randomisation process (block size of 2) may have introduced a selection bias in the study.
-  There were also deviations from the final protocol and statistical analysis plan. The statistical concerns include the fact that no pre-specified primary analysis has been published and the fact that the study was stopped early following the publication of the RODIN study indicating that Kogenate FS might be associated with an increased risk of inhibitor formation. Although this could not have been prevented, an early termination of an open label trial raises the possibility of investigator bias and inflation of the probability of detecting an effect that is not present.
-  Finally, the PRAC noted that to date most studies evaluating a differential risk of inhibitor development between classes of FVIII products suffer from a variety of potential methodological limitations and based on the available data considered there is no clear and consistent evidence to suggest differences in relative risk between classes of FVIII products. Specifically, the findings from the SIPPET study, as well as those from the individual clinical trials and observational studies included in the MAH responses, are not sufficient to confirm any consistent statistically and clinically meaningful differences in inhibitor risk between the rFVIII and pdFVIII product classes.
-  Treatment regimens in EU are different from those in the SIPPET study. The relevance for clinical practice in the EU (and therefore for the products subject to this procedure) is therefore questioned. It is uncertain whether the findings of SIPPET can be extrapolated to the risk of inhibitors in PUPs in current clinical practice in the EU as treatment modality and intensity have been suggested as risk factors for inhibitor development in previous studies. Importantly, the EU SmPCs do not include modified prophylaxis (as defined in the SIPPET study) as an authorised posology, and the impact of the apparent imbalance in the unspecified other combinations of treatment modality on the SIPPET findings is unclear. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether the same differential risk of inhibitor development observed in the SIPPET study would be apparent in patient populations treated in routine care in other countries where the modality of treatment (i.e. primary prophylaxis) is different from that in the study. The additional points of clarification provided by the SIPPET authors do not fully resolve this uncertainty. Having considered the abovementioned results from SIPPET, the published literature and all the information submitted by the MAHs, as well as the views expressed by experts expressed at the ad-hoc expert meeting, the PRAC concluded that:  Inhibitor development is an identified risk with both pdFVIII and rFVIII products. Although the clinical studies for some individual products have identified limited numbers of cases of inhibitor development, these tend to be small studies with methodological limitations, or studies not adequately designed to evaluate this risk.  The FVIII products are heterogenous, and the plausibility of different rates of inhibitor development between individual products cannot be excluded.  Individual studies have identified a wide range of inhibitor development across products, but the direct comparability of study results is questionable based on diversity of study methods and patient populations over time.  The SIPPET study was not designed to evaluate the risk of inhibitor development for individual products, and included a limited number of FVIII products. Due to heterogeneity across products, there is considerable uncertainty in extrapolating the findings of studies that have evaluated only class effects to individual products; and particularly to products (including more recently authorised products) which are not included in such studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In view of the above, the PRAC recommended the following updates of sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC as well as sections 2 and 4 of the Package Leaflet for the FVIII products indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) as follows:

-  The section 4.4 of the SmPC should be amended to include a warning on the clinical importance of monitoring patients for FVIII inhibitor development (in particular warning on the clinical consequences of low compared to high titre inhibitors).
-  With regards to sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC, the PRAC noted that several FVIII products currently include reference to data from study results which do not allow for a definite conclusion on the inhibitor risk for individual products. As the evidence suggests that all human FVIII products carry a risk of inhibitor development such statements should be removed. The available data supports a frequency of FVIII inhibitor development within the frequency of 'very common' and 'uncommon', for PUPs and PTPs respectively, therefore the PRAC recommends that the SmPCs should be aligned with these frequencies unless justified by product specific data. For products for which section 4.2 contains the following statement for PUPs: '&lt;Previously untreated patients. The safety and efficacy of {(Invented) name} in previously untreated patients have not yet been established. No data are available. &gt; ), the above frequency for PUPs should not be implemented. In relation to section 5.1, any reference to inhibitor development studies in PUPs and PTPs should be deleted unless the studies were conducted in compliance with a Paediatric Investigation Plan or the studies provide robust evidence of a frequency of inhibitors in PUP which is less than 'very common' or for PTPs which is different from 'uncommon' (as laid down in the attachments of the PRAC AR). Further to the assessment of the totality of the responses submitted by the MAH for susoctocog alfa (Obizur), the PRAC is of the opinion that the outcome of this article 31 referral procedure does not apply to this product in view of the indication of Obizur (acquired haemophilia A due to inhibitory antibodies to endogenous FVIII) and the different target population. Benefit -risk balance Based on the current evidence from the SIPPET study, as well as data from the individual clinical trials and observational studies included in the MAH responses, and the views expressed by the experts of the ad-hoc expert meeting, the PRAC agreed that the current evidence does not provide clear and consistent evidence of any statistically and clinically meaningful differences in inhibitor risk between rFVIII and pdFVIII products. No conclusions can be drawn on any role of VWF in protecting against inhibitor development. Given these are heterogenous products, this does not preclude individual products being associated with an increased risk of inhibitor development in ongoing or future PUP studies. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Individual studies have identified a wide range of inhibitor frequency in PUPs across products, and the SIPPET study was not designed to differentiate between individual products in each class. Due to very different study methods and patient populations that have been studied over time, and inconsistent findings across studies, the PRAC found that the totality of evidence does not support a conclusion that recombinant factor VIII medicines, as a class, poses a greater risk of inhibitor development than the class derived from plasma.

Besides, the PRAC noted that several FVIII products currently include in their product information reference to data from study results which do not allow a definite conclusion on the inhibitor risk for individual products. As the evidence suggests that all human FVIII products carry a risk of inhibitor development, within the frequency of 'very common' and 'uncommon' for PUPs and PTPs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

respectively, the PRAC recommends that the SmPCs should be aligned with these frequencies unless justified by product specific data.

In view of the above, the PRAC concluded that the benefit-risk balance of Factor VIII products indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency), remains favourable subject to the changes to the product information agreed (section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC).

The experts emphasized that collaboration between academia, industry and regulators should be encouraged to collect harmonised data through registries.

Re-examination procedure Following the adoption of the PRAC recommendation during the May 2017 PRAC meeting, the MAH LFB Biomedicaments expressed their disagreement with the initial PRAC recommendation. Given the detailed grounds provided by the MAH, the PRAC carried out a new assessment of the available data in the context of the re-examination. PRAC discussion on grounds for re-examination The SIPPET study was not designed to evaluate the risk of inhibitor development for individual products, and included a limited number of FVIII products. Due to heterogeneity across products, there is considerable uncertainty in extrapolating the findings of studies that have evaluated only class effects to individual products; and particularly to products (including more recently authorised products) which are not included in such studies. The findings from the SIPPET study, as well as those from the individual clinical trials and observational studies, are not sufficient to confirm any consistent statistically and clinically meaningful differences in inhibitor risk between the rFVIII and pdFVIII product classes. Overall, the PRAC maintains its conclusions that standardised information on the frequency for FVIII products in PUP and PTP should be reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC, unless another frequency range for a specific medicinal product is demonstrated by robust clinical studies for which the results would be summarised in section 5.1. Expert consultation The PRAC consulted an ad-hoc expert meeting on some of the aspects that formed part of the detailed grounds submitted by LFB Biomedicaments. Overall, the expert group supported the PRAC initial conclusions and agreed that the proposed product information provides an adequate level of information to appropriately communicate to prescribers and patients about the risk of inhibitor development. No additional communication, on risk factors for inhibitor development beyond the product information or any additional risk minimisation measures was recommended. The group also agreed that specific data about frequency of inhibitors for each product should not be included in the SmPC as the available studies are not adequately powered to draw precise conclusions on the absolute frequency for each product or on the relative frequency of inhibitors between products.

## PRAC conclusions

In conclusion, further to the initial assessment and the re-examination procedure, PRAC maintains its conclusion that the benefit-risk balance of the human plasma derived and recombinant coagulation Factor VIII containing medicinal products remains favourable subject to the agreed changes to the product information (section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  PRAC  adopted  a  recommendation  on  01  September  2017  which  was  then  considered  by  the CHMP, in accordance with Article 107k of Directive 2001/83/EC.

## Overall summary of the scientific evaluation by the PRAC

Whereas,

- The PRAC considered the procedure under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC resulting from pharmacovigilance data, for human plasma derived and recombinant coagulation factor VIII containing medicinal products (see Annex I and Annex A).
-  The PRAC noted that the efficacy and safety of Factor VIII products as indicated in the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A have been established.Based on the available data, the PRAC considered that SmPC updates for the FVIII products are warranted: section 4.4 should be amended to include a warning on the clinical importance of monitoring patients for FVIII inhibitor development. With regards to sections 4.8 and 5.1, the PRAC noted that several FVIII products currently include reference to data from study results which do not allow a definite conclusion on the inhibitor risk for individual products. Results of clinical studies not sufficiently robust (e.g. suffering from methodolical limitations) should not be reflected in the product information on FVIIII products. The PRAC recommended changes to the product information accordingly. Besides, as the evidence suggests that all human FVIII products carry a risk of inhibitor development, within the frequency of 'very common' and 'uncommon', for PUPs
- The PRAC considered the totality of the data submitted with regards to the risk of inhibitor development for the classes of recombinant and plasma derived FVIII products, in previously untreated patients (PUPs). This included published literature (SIPPET study 6 ), data generated in individual clinical trials and a range of observational studies submitted by the marketing authorisation holders, including the data generated in large multicentre cohort studies, data submitted by the national competent authorities of the EU Member States as well as responses provided by the Authors of the SIPPET study. PRAC also considered grounds submitted by LFB Biomedicaments as basis for their request for reexamination of the PRAC recommendation and the views of two experts meetings held on 22 February and 3 August 2017. · The PRAC noted that the SIPPET study was not designed to evaluate the risk of inhibitor development for individual products, and included a limited number of FVIII products in total. Due to the heterogeneity across products, there is considerable uncertainty in extrapolating the findings of studies evaluating only class effects to individual products; and particularly to the products that are not included in such studies. · The PRAC also considered that studies conducted to date suffer from a variety of methodological limitations and, on balance, there is no clear and consistent evidence to suggest differences in relative risks between FVIII product classes based on available data. Specifically, the findings from the SIPPET study, as well as those from the individual clinical trials and observational studies included in the MAH responses, are not sufficient to confirm any consistent statistically and clinically meaningful differences in inhibitor risk between rFVIII and pdFVIII product classes. Given these are heterogenous products, this does not preclude individual products being associated with an increased risk of inhibitor development in ongoing or future PUP studies.

and PTPs respectively, the PRAC recommended that the product information of these products should be aligned with these frequencies unless justified by product specific data.

Therefore, the PRAC concluded that the benefit-risk balance of the human plasma derived and recombinant coagulation Factor VIII containing medicinal products remains favourable and recommended the variations to the terms of the marketing authorisations.
