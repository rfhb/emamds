1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Eye disorders caused by changes in the centre of the retina (maculopathy) were identified as a new side effect of Trobalt and new techniques including fundus photography and ocular coherence tomography are recommended to be used as part of the already recommended regular eye examinations. Patients with maculopathy should be closely monitored and the benefits of continued treatment should be carefully weight against the risks. Overall, the CHMP recommended the renewal of the marketing authorisation, but considered that another renewal in five years' time was needed. |
