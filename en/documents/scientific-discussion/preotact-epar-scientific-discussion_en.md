## 1 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1 Introduction

Postmenopausal  osteoporosis  (PMO)  is  a  common  disorder  affecting  a  large  number  of women  above  the  age  of  50  years.  It  is  currently  defined  as  a  systemic  skeletal  disease characterised by low bone mass and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to enhanced bone fragility and a consequent increase in fracture risk. Osteoporosis affects an estimated  75  million  people  in  Europe,  United  States  and  Japan  combined.  Osteoporotic fractures represent a major health problem.

The  treatment  of  osteoporosis  in  postmenopausal  women  generally  involves  the  use  of therapeutic agents that inhibit bone resorption (hormone replacement therapy, bisphosphonates,  selective  oestrogen  receptor  modulators  and  calcitonin).  These  drugs  are effective  in  reducing  bone  turnover,  as  indicated  by  the  changes  in  markers  of  both  bone formation and resorption[1, 2].  The effect of these drugs on bone density is maximal during the first year, resulting in total gains in bone density of less than 10% over 3 years [3, 4].

## About the product

However,  many  postmenopausal  women  have  lost  over  30%  of  their  peak  bone  mass  and continue to have fractures after being treated with anti-resorptive drugs. An ideal therapy for osteoporosis would not only inhibit further bone loss, but would also continually stimulate new  bone  formation.  Parathyroid  hormone  (PTH)  increases  trabecular  bone  density  by stimulating bone formation [5, 6]. Markers of bone formation and resorption increase during PTH treatment[7], and vertebral bone density increases by about 10% after 2 years[8]. The  anabolic  activity  of  PTH  and  N-terminal  fragment  analogues  of  PTH  has  been investigated for many years. The mechanism by which PTH or N-terminal fragments of PTH increase rather than decrease bone mineral density (BMD) is not fully elucidated; however, it is well established that the duration of exposure is critical [9]. PTH is secreted primarily in response  to  a  fall  in  plasma  calcium  levels  and  is  the  principal  regulator  of  calcium homeostasis [10, 11].  PTH acts in the kidney to increase renal tubular calcium re-absorption and to increase the synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which increases intestinal calcium absorption [10, 12].  PTH acts in bone to increase the number and activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts  and  increases  bone  turnover.  With  sustained  elevations  in  PTH,  osteoclastic activity could exceed that of osteoblasts resulting in a net release of calcium from bone and a decrease  in  BMD  [13,  14].  In  contrast,  single  daily  injections  of  PTH  that  cause  transient stimulation of the PTH-1 receptor, could increase osteoblastic activity preferentially, thereby increasing BMD and bone strength. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Parathyroid  hormone  (PTH)  is  recombinant  human  parathyroid  hormone,  a  bone  anabolic agent that is being developed by NPS Allelix Corp. (a subsidiary of NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Acronyms used during the development were ALX1-11, Preotact, recombinant (rDNA) parathyroid hormone, parathyroid  hormone  (r.E.coli),  parathyrin,  parathormone  PTH(1-84),  hPTH,  hPTH(1-84), rhPTH,  rhPTH(1-84),  rPTH,  rPTH(1-84).  PTH  is  identical  to  endogenous  human  PTH. Endogenous  PTH  is  a  polypeptide  consisting  of  84  amino  acids,  that  is  synthesized  and secreted  by  the  parathyroid  glands  and  is  the  principal  regulator  of  plasma  calcium homeostasis through concerted actions on kidney, intestine, and bone.

The  drug  substance  is  produced  by  recombinant  DNA  technology  in Escherichia  coli. In contrast  to  already  authorised  PTH  products,  PTH  contains  the  full  PTH  sequence  of  84 amino acids. Previously authorised PTH products only contain the N-terminal fragment PTH (amino  acid  1-34),  as  the  C-terminal  fragment  (amino  acid  35-84)  was  believed  to  be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

biologically  unimportant.  It  has  however  been  found  that  the  C-terminal  has  intrinsic biological activity that is mediated by a specific C-terminal PTH receptor [15, 16].

With  the  present application, the applicant sought  a marketing  authorization  for the ' Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women as diagnosed by clinically acceptable criteria such as low bone mineral density (BMD) or prior fragility fractures '.

The  dose  proposed  by  the  applicant  was  100 µ g  administered  as  a  daily  subcutaneous injection in the thigh or abdomen for a duration of up to 2 years.

## 1.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

The  drug  substance  of  Preotact  is  a  recombinant  human  parathyroid  hormone  (rhPTH) produced in E. coli that is identical to the endogenous human PTH.

RhPTH is manufactured by fermentation at an 1100 L scale, followed by a 2-step recovery and a 5-step purification process and terminated by filtration and filling.

N/A

## The intended therapeutic indication of PTH is the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fractures. PTH has been demonstrated to increase bone size and mineral content, thereby improving bone quality and strength. PTH is presented as a powder and solvent for solution for injection. The container closure system is  comprised of a Type I glass dual-chamber cartridge, a bromobutyl rubber center stopper,  an  aluminium  crimp  cap  containing  a  bromobutyl  rubber  seal  and  sealing  the  first chamber, and a bromobutyl rubber end stopper sealing the second chamber. The first chamber contains  the  lyophilised  drug  substance  (100 µ g  per  dose)  and  the  excipients  (citric  acid monohydrate, sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, mannitol); the second chamber  contains  the  solvent  for  mixing  (water  for  injections  and  m-cresol).  PTH  is administered with a reusable CE-marked pen device. Each cartridge contains 14 doses. Drug Substance Nomenclature INN Name: Parathyroid hormone Compendial name: Chemical name: Parathormone (human recombinant) USAN/BAN/JAN Name: Parathyroid hormone (r.E.coli) Laboratory Code: ALX1-11, PTH CAS Registry Number: 68893-82-3 Other Names: PTH(1-84), hPTH, hPTH(1-84), rhPTH, rhPTH(1-84), rPTH, rPTH(1-84) Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Description of the drug substance

RhPTH is produced as a fusion protein. Post-translational processing involves the cleavage of the  OmpA  leader  sequence,  leaving  the  mature  protein  as  a  single-chain  84  amino-acids polypeptide (9.4 kDa) whose sequence is identical to that of the full-length native endogenous human PTH. It has no disulfide bonds and no glycosylation sites.

The biological actions of rhPTH are mediated through binding to at least two distinct highaffinity  cell-surface  receptors  specific  for  the  N-terminal  and  C-terminal  regions  of  the molecule, both of which are required for normal bone metabolism. The N-terminal portion of the molecule is primarily responsible for the bone building effects of parathyroid hormone. The C-terminal portion of the molecule has antiresorptive activity and is necessary for normal regulation of N-terminal fragment activity.

## · Manufacture

The drug substance is produced by SynCo Bio Partners B.V, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This manufacturing site was last inspected in September 2003 and authorised in June 2004. The  facilities  are  operated  in  current  GMP  (cGMP)  compliance,  with  standard  operating procedures in place to describe all procedures and controls.

## Development genetics

The  expression plasmid pJT42  was  constructed using a synthetically  produced  PTH expression  region,  the  lactose  operator  for  the  induction  of  PTH  gene,  a  tetracyclineresistance  gene  for  selection  and  an  origin  of  replication.  The  PTH  expression  region produces a fusion protein of 105 amino acids, which consists of the PTH protein (84 amino acids) and the signal peptide of E. coli outer membrane protein A (OmpA, 21 amino acids) permitting the secretion of PTH into the culture medium. This leader sequence is removed from the fusion protein by an E. coli signal peptidase. The rhPTH gene was codon-optimized to utilise the codons most frequently used in E. coli .

pJT42  was  introduced  into  an E. coli host  cell  line  PAL1000.  After  selection  with tetracycline, one stable clone was isolated and sub-cloned to obtain the parental cell line from which the master cell bank (MCB) was prepared. Cell bank system A two-tiered cell bank system was developed and maintained in accordance to cGMP. The Master Cell Bank (MCB) and the initial Working Cell Bank (WCB) were prepared in 1992 according  to  the  same  procedure.  An  appropriate  range  of  tests  was  performed  for  their characterisation, including culture purity, viability, phenotypic characteristics, bacteriophage test,  plasmid  DNA sequence, plasmid stability, plasmid identity, plasmid copy number. All specifications  were  met.  Cells  banks  were  extensively  examined  for  the  presence  of adventitious agents. Upon exhaustion  of  the  initial  WCB,  a  second  WCB  was  prepared  in  2004  with  a  similar procedure.  This  new  WCB  was  not  available  for  clinical  studies  and  will  be  used  for commercial production of the drug substance. It was tested and released by the same methods and with the same specifications as for the MCB and the original WCB. The two WCBs were shown  to  be  comparable  by  release  testing  and  additional  qualification  tests  and  by characterisation of production cells (extended generations). Fermentation process The  fermentation  process  consists  of  inoculation,  cell  growth  in  a  production  fermentor, induction  and  secretion  into  the  fermentation  broth.  The  recovery  process  involves  cell separation by centrifugation and filtration followed by an ultrafiltration/diafiltration step. No reprocessing is permitted. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The original fermentation was conducted at the 200 L scale for preclinical studies, early Phase I and Phase II clinical studies and then scaled-up to 1100 L for the other Phase I studies, for Phase III studies and for commercial manufacture.

The  operations  and  controls  of  the  process  were  adequately  described  and  appropriate validation data were provided. Full details of the cell culture raw materials, their source and control were provided.

## Purification process

The  purification  process  consists  of  5  chromatographic  steps.  The  product  is  then  filtered through a 0.2 µm filter and filled into sterile stainless steel containers.

The drug substance is shipped under controlled temperature conditions to the manufacturer of the drug product and stored at or below -70 ° C.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  purification  process  was  adequately  described.  Details  about  column  dimensions  and operating  conditions  such  as  volumes,  pH,  flow  rates,  temperature  and  buffer  composition (including sanitization and storage) of each step were provided. In-process control batch data from the filtered solution for storage complied with the established parameters.

4 categories of process-related impurities were identified:

- Host organism-derived impurities: E. coli protein, endotoxin, DNA;
- Process reagents: tetracycline, EDTA, acetonitrile, silicone (antifoam);
- Chromatography resin leachates;

- Filter extractables.

Levels of these process-related impurities were  assessed by routine  measurement  in production  lots  of  PTH  drug  substance  and/or  clearance  studies.  Analysis  of  in-process products  for  a  number  of  host-organism  derived  impurities  and  process  material-derived impurities,  as  well  as  additional  clearance  studies,  demonstrate  that  the  presence  of  these impurities  is  well  controlled  in  the  process. The  results  presented  by  the  applicant  show consistent removal of process-related impurities.

A number of product-related impurities have been identified that consist of N- or C-terminally truncated variants or of other variants appearing as a result of chemical modifications, such as oxidation, deamidation. Detection of the truncated peptides was obtained by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Identification of the oxidized variants was obtained by cyanogen bromide  digestion  and  comparison  to  chemically  generated  reference  material.  Relevant product-related impurities (PTH(1-80), Met8[ox] PTH, Met18[ox] PTH)  are routinely measured in PTH drug substance as part of release testing.  Results of release testing were presented and demonstrate that the levels of these impurities are all within the specification limits. The identification of product-related impurities has been conducted on various rhPTH drug substance  lots  representative  of  the  commercial  scale  (1100  L  fermentation)  and  used  to produce PTH product for the Phase III clinical trials. Of the three specified impurities, both Met18[ox]PTH and PTH(1-80) are biologically active and can be categorized as PTH-related substances. Several other impurities have also been identified and characterized. These impurities are all present  at  levels  &lt; 0.1%  peak  area  and  may  not  be  consistently  present  in  all  rhPTH  drug substance  lots.  Therefore,  a  common  specification  has  been  set  but  an  individual  limit  or separate analysis will not be carried out. With regard to adventitious agents safety, tryptone and  are the only raw materials of animal origin  used  in  the  process;  they  both  belong  to  the  category  of  milk  derivatives  from  milk collected for human consumption, in accordance with Ph. Eur. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  manufacturing  process  and  facility  are  designed  to  prevent  contamination  during production. Potential non-viral adventitious agents such as contaminating bacteria, mycoplasma, fungi, TSE agents are controlled at several levels. The bacterial cells used to initiate the fermentation process do not contain mammalian viruses and have been shown to be free of bacteriophage. Appropriate environmental  controls are exerted during the manufacture in order to prevent the introduction of adventitious viruses.

No viral validation studies were performed, which is considered acceptable since no human or animal cell lines are used.

The overall adventitious agents safety is considered satisfactory.

## Manufacturing process development and process validation

The drug substance is manufactured using a standard fermentation and purification process. A number of changes were made during development, in one single revision before the start of Phase III clinical studies. They include scale-up of the fermentation process from 200 L to 1100  L,  with  consequential  scale-up  of  the  purification  process,  implementation  of  the ultrafiltration/diafiltration step and an additional chromatographic step and finally storage of the purified drug substance as a frozen liquid instead of lyophilised.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It was considered that the changes introduced are not likely to have an impact on the quality attributes  of  the  drug  substance.  A  comparability  exercise  was  performed  and  was  mainly based  on  process  performance  data,  drug  substance  release  data  and  a  limited  number  of additional  tests.    This  was  considered  adequate  to  support  the  manufacturing  changes introduced and the results obtained were satisfactory.

The objective of the validation studies was to demonstrate that the manufacturing process is suitable for its intended purpose and capable of consistently and reliably producing product that  meets  all  predefined  quality  attributes.  The  manufacturing  process  has  been  carefully validated.  Validation  data  from  3  consecutive  batches  were  provided  and  were  considered satisfactory.

## Characterisation

## - Physicochemical characterisation:

The amino-acid sequence, determined by N-terminal Edman degradation, is identical to that of  the  native  human  parathyroid  hormone.  MS  analysis  confirmed  the  molecular  weight  of 9.42  kDa,  the  removal  of  the  OmpaA  leader  sequence  and  the  absence  of  any  posttranslational modification.

Secondary structure was determined by circular dichroism.

RhPTH  is  a  monomeric  protein  as  demonstrated  by  MS,  SDS-PAGE  and  analytical ultracentrifugation.  Covalent  or  non-covalent  aggregates  were  not  detected  at  a  significant level.

RhPTH does  not  contain  cysteine  residues,  so  no  intra-  or  intermolecular  disulfide  bridge exists.

## - Biological characterisation

The  biological  activity  assay  is  based  on  the  interaction  of  the  hormone  with  its  receptors localized  in  the  plasma  membrane  of  target  cells.  The  significance  of  the  PTH  receptor complex  in  mediating  the  actions  of  PTH  is  supported  by  studies  of  resistance  to  PTH. Therefore, the method chosen was considered relevant in order to mimic a clinical response.

Methods used for the characterisation of the drug substance are considered state-of-the-art. The  drug  substance  has  been  well  characterised  and  the  results  provided  are  considered satisfactory

## · Specifications

Establishment of specifications were based on 59 released lots of drug substance produced using the commercial process. All batches used for pivotal clinical and stability studies have been included.

The  analytical  methods  included  in  the  control  system  are  used  to  evaluate  the  identity, quality,  safety,  purity,  potency  of  the  drug  substance  and  to  assure  the  consistency  of physicochemical and biological attributes of rhPTH. The methods were carefully validated. The specifications that have been set are considered sufficiently justified. Based on the data presented  in  the  dossier  showing  that  the  purification  process  is  consistently  capable  to remove DNA at an acceptable low level, it was considered acceptable not to perform a release test for DNA content.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## · Stability

The applicant has performed real-time and accelerated stability studies designed in accordance with ICH guidelines to monitor the time-temperature stability of cGMP lots.

Stability  data  on  10  full-scale  production  batches  of  drug  substance  were  presented.  Data include storage at -70 ° C, -20 ° C and 4-5 ° C as follows:

- Five batches manufactured at the 1100 L scale and stored in stainless steel containers. One lot has been analyzed up to 36 months, two lots up to 24 months and 3 lots up to 12 months.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Five  batches  manufactured  at  the  1100  L  scale  and  stored  in  glass  containers  have  been presented as supportive studies. Data up to 5 years of storage have been presented for 4 lots and up to four years for one lot.

The  stability  data  provided  were  considered  satisfactory  and  support  the  proposed  storage conditions  of  the  commercial  drug  substance  (30  months  at  -70 ° C  in  stainless  steel containers).

Shipping  of  drug  substance  to  the  manufacturer  of  the  drug  product  is  performed  under controlled temperature conditions below -20°C. This is considered acceptable as the stability studies performed at -20°C indicate that the drug substance is stable for several months at this temperature.

## Drug Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The  clinical  formulation  used  in  Phase  Ia,  Ib  and  II  clinical  studies  was  a  single-use lyophilised formulation in a glass vial to be reconstituted with water for injections. The drug substance was formulated with a citrate buffer pH 6 and mannitol which is a bulking agent commonly used for lyophilised products. The proposed commercial multi-dose formulation was introduced prior to Phase III studies. Sodium  chloride  was  added  to  minimize  variability  in  concentration  of  sodium  chloride coming from drug substance. It also serves as a tonicity modifier. The pH was adjusted with hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide aqueous, based on stability data and in an effort to minimise  pain  upon  injection.  The  change  from  a  single-use  to  a  multi-dose  formulation required the presence of a preservative agent; m-cresol was selected. All selected excipients comply with Ph. Eur. A bioequivalence study was conducted in adult males to compare the single-use formulation used  in  Phase  II  studies  to  the  multi-dose  formulation  used  in  Phase  III  studies.  Data demonstrated that the two formulations have similar bioavailability. The  commercial  container/closure  system  is  a  dual-chamber  cartridge  containing  the  front chamber (lyophilised  drug  substance  formulated  with  the  excipients)  and  the  rear  chamber (solvent  for  mixed  containing  water  for  in  injections  and  m-cresol).  The  cartridge  is constructed  from  Type  I  glass.  Each  chamber  is  closed  with  bromobutyl  rubber  stoppers. These standard pharmaceutical materials have been shown to be safe and compatible with the lyophilised powder and the solvent for mixing. The cartridge is mounted with a self-injection pen (CE-marked) for subcutaneous administration. The multi-dose cartridge and pen have been evaluated for dose accuracy and found to be compliant with the relevant ISO standards. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Each cartridge contains 14 doses of 100 µ g  of  drug  substance.  The  dual-chamber cartridge contains no overage.

## · Manufacture of the product

The  drug  product  is  manufactured  by  Vetter  Pharma-Fertingung  GmbH,  Ravensburg, Germany. This site was inspected in April 2004 by the German authorities and was found GMP compliant.

The PTH solution is compounded using the drug substance, sterile filtered, aseptically filled into  the  front  chamber  of  the  glass  cartridge,  and  lyophilised.  The  solvent  for  mixing  is compounded, sterile filtered and aseptically filled into the rear chamber of the cartridge. The cartridge  is  sealed  and  inspected.  Cartridges  are  packaged  in  cartons.  Reprocessing  is  not performed.

Pooling of maximum of two drug substance batches is considered acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## - Preparation of lyophilised powder:

Mannitol, citrate  buffer,  and  sodium  chloride  are  mixed  in  a  stainless  steel  container.    The drug substance is thawed and added to the mixture, the pH is adjusted, and additional citrate buffer is added to achieve the final target weight. Water for injections is added to dilute the compounded PTH solution to the target concentration. The pH is measured and adjusted if necessary. The compounded PTH solution is tested for pH and bioburden.

The diluted PTH solution is filtered into a stainless steel pressure vessel through a 0.22 µ m filter  and  then  stored  at  2 ° C  to  8 ° C  for  up  to  24 hours  prior  to  filling.    The  filtered  PTH solution is tested for bioburden.

Before the front chamber is filled, the center stopper is inserted into the cartridge. The front chamber  is  filled  to  a  target  volume  of  1.2  mL.  Process  tests  performed  during  the  filling operation  include  glide  force  measurement,  stopper  position  check  and  fill  weight  check. Filter integrity is tested before and after filtration.

The filled cartridges are transferred to the freeze dryer and a freeze-drying cycle, consisting of freezing, primary drying and secondary drying, is performed.  After the freeze-drying cycle, the front chamber is sealed with a crimp cap prior to the rear chamber fill. The lyophilized powder is tested for residual moisture.

## - Preparation of solvent for mixing (rear chamber):

M-cresol is added to a vessel containing water for injections and the volume is adjusted with water for injections to the required final weight. The m-cresol solution is tested for bioburden.

The m-cresol solution is filtered through a 0.22 m filter into a stainless steel pressure vessel and stored at 2 ° C to 8 ° C for up to 6 days prior to filling. The filtered solvent for mixing is tested for bioburden.

Prior  to  filling,  the  solvent  for  mixing  is  filtered  through  a  0.22 µ m  in-line  filter.  The cartridges  are  sealed  with  rubber  stoppers  and  moved  to  storage.    Process  tests  performed during the filling of the rear chamber include end stopper position and fill weight check. Filter integrity is tested before and after filtration.

The drug product manufacturing process has been validated for four batches with regard to filtration, holding times, filling, lyophilisation cycle, container closure and major equipment. It  is  considered  that  relevant  validation  studies  have  been  performed  and  the  results  are considered acceptable.

## · Specifications

All methods for release testing of the drug product have been adequately described and are validated. The selected parameters tested on drug product have been adequately justified and are  considered  acceptable.  Sufficient  batch  analysis  results  confirm  the  consistency  of  the drug product. No new impurities are formed during the manufacture of the drug product and the purity profile of the drug product is comparable to that of the drug substance.

µ Medicinal product no longer authorised

The proposed limits are considered acceptable.

## · Stability of the Product

The proposed storage conditions are:

- For the drug product: 30 months stored below 25 o C;

- For the mixed solution: 28 days stored at 2-8° C with storage of up to 7 days below 25°C.

The stability of the drug product was extensively investigated and included real-time data at 4 o C or 5 o C, 25 o C and 30 o C and accelerated data at 40 o C for up to 6 months, the drug product being stored in the proposed dual-chamber cartridge. Long-term  data on 6 batches manufactured with the commercial process were provided for up to 30 months.

The proposed shelf  life  specification  limits  for  purity  by  RP-HPLC  and  by  CE-HPLC  and impurities by RP-HPLC were wider than the release limits. Stability data for the drug product clearly  showed  that  it  is  more  stable  when  stored  at  2-8°C  compared  to  storage  at  room

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

temperature,  especially  with  regard  to  impurity  levels.  However,  given  that  the  impurity levels were shown to be safe in toxicological studies, the proposed storage conditions at 25° C was considered acceptable.

For the mixed product, in-use data at 4° C, 25° C and 40° C for up to 30 days were provided. The applicant  committed  to  perform  in-use  stability  studies  at  the  end  of  the  drug  product shelf life for 6 batches.

A photostability study evaluated the exposure of lyophilized PTH product in cartridges. These results showed that PTH product is light sensitive. Therefore, the proposed condition 'Keep the dual-chamber cartridge in the outer carton in order to protect from light' is adequate.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

In general, the different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with existing guidelines.

Cell banks have been established and adequately characterised. However, with regard to the most  recent  working  cell  bank  (WCB)  that  will  be  used  in  production,  the  applicant committed  to  provide  the  data  of  three  commercial  batches  derived  from  this  new  WCB, including the results of the tests used for the characterisation of the drug substance.

The  pharmaceutical  development  of  the  drug  product  has  been  thoroughly  and  adequately described.  The  applicant  provided  a  new  preservative  efficacy  study  for  m-cresol  that complies to Ph. Eur. and whose results are acceptable.

The  drug  substance  manufacturing  process  is  well  defined  and  adequately  controlled  with appropriate in-process controls in place, and sufficient in-process specifications are set based on process validation. The manufacturing process has been carefully validated with respect to all relevant parameters and good consistency has been shown based on the large number of commercial-scale batches produced. The comparability exercise of materials from the old and new process was mainly based on process performance data, release testing data on the drug substance and drug product and a limited number of additional tests. This comparability study was considered acceptable and the results satisfactory. The drug substance has been well characterised. Sources of heterogeneity have been assessed in  detail  using  a  wide  variety  of  state-of-the-art  techniques.  The  test  methods  chosen  are considered adequate. The release tests for the drug substance and the specifications that have been set, based on release  data  from  59  full-scale  batches  and  stability  data,  are  considered  appropriate. Specifications for product-related impurities (two oxidised forms and one truncated variant) were recently introduced. With  the  responses  to  the  Day  120  List  of  Questions  (D120  LoQ),  the  applicant  provided updated  stability  data  on  five  lots  of  drug  substance.  All  parameters  are  within  the specification limits and, therefore, the proposed shelf life of 30 months at -70°C for the drug substance was considered acceptable . Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  drug  product  manufacturing  process,  together  with  in-process  controls,  has  been adequately described; critical steps  have  been defined and controlled. The  applicant confirmed  that  pooling  of  a  maximum  of  two  lots  of  drug  substance  is  allowed.  Process validation has been performed for four batches with regard to filtration, holding times, filling, lyophilisation cycle, container closure system and major equipment and the results obtained are considered satisfactory.

The  specification  limits  for  the  drug  product  have  been  adequately  justified  and  are considered  acceptable.  Following  the  D120  LoQ,  a  test  for  osmolality  (Ph.  Eur.)  has  been added  to  the  specifications  of  the  mixed  solution  of  drug  product;  the  proposed  limit  is acceptable.

The proposed storage conditions of 30 months below 25°C for the non-mixed product and 28 days at 2-8°C for the mixed solution, with storage of up to 7 days below 25°C, have been

satisfactorily  justified.  However,  the  applicant  has  committed  to  perform  in-use  stability studies for six batches at the end of the proposed shelf life.

The quality  of  Preotact  has  been  adequately  demonstrated.  Except  for  a  number  of  quality points that the applicant agreed to address by commitments and a post authorisation follow-up measure, the overall quality of Preotact is considered acceptable.

## 1.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Apart  from  a  few  safety  pharmacology  studies,  all  pivotal in  vivo safety  studies  used  the subcutaneous  (SC)  route,  included  appropriate  toxicokinetic  monitoring  and  were  GLPcompliant.

## Pharmacology

· Primary pharmacodynamics ( in vitro/in vivo ) Primary pharmacodynamics have been investigated in vivo in ovariectomised (OVX) rat and monkey, which are well-established models of human postmenopausal osteoporosis [17-21]. Ovariectomy leads to a moderate bone loss due to oestrogen depletion. Two pivotal treatment studies  were  performed  in  aged  OVX  rat  (10  months  old)  and  monkey  (12-17  years  old), respectively. Both studies had a duration of more than the recommended six bone remodelling cycles [22]. OVX  rat  showed  clear  signs  of  osteopenia  based  on  decreased  trabecular  BMD  and histomorphometric parameters whereas bone strength was not affected. By six months, daily SC administration of 15 and 30 µ g/kg rhPTH(1-84) dose-dependently increased the BMD to or above the sham vehicle level at all investigated skeletal sites (both trabecular and cortical). Treatment  increased  trabecular  bone  volume  and  thickness.  Similarly,  dose-dependent increases in cortical bone area and thickness were seen. Femur and lumbar vertebrae-4 bone strength increased dose-dependently with treatment. Altogether, the lowest effective dose in OVX rats was 15 µ g/kg/day given subcutaneously.

In  the  pivotal  monkey  study,  ovariectomy  lead  to  a  decrease  in  bone  mass  in  all  analysed bones, although was not statistically significant in all cases. With respect to histomorphometry,  no  statistically  significant  signs  of  osteopenia  were  seen  even  after  25 months of oestrogen deficiency.  Furthermore,  no  significant  decrease  in  bone  strength  was seen. Over a period of 16 months, OVX monkey were administered 5, 10 or 25 µ g/kg/day PTH  subcutaneously.  Treatment  caused  dose-dependent  increases  in  BMD  at  primarily trabecular bone sites and 5 µ g/kg/day increased BMD to sham-vehicle levels. Trabecular bone volume was increased primarily due to an increase in trabecular number and not thickness, which corresponds to what is seen in the clinic. Treatment-related increases in vertebral bone strength were seen in the compression test. However, dose-dependent decreases in BMD were seen  in  cortical  bone.  Furthermore,  cortical  area,  cortical  thickness  and  porosity  were increased while the BMC was decreased. These findings question the quality of the cortical bone formed as a response to PTH treatment. Particularly as some femur and radius cortical bone strength  parameters  were  decreased  in  all  dose  groups  when  evaluated  in  the  3-point bending test, although the decrease was only significant in the high-dose group. The femur neck shear test showed no significant differences between femoral peak-load and stiffness in PTH treated and vehicle animals besides an increase in the work-to-failure parameter.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

A secondary pharmacodynamics study showed that PTH had a negative inotropic effect on the myocardium in vitro , with an IC50 value of 2.5x10 -9 M. In women, a SC injection of PTH leads  to  a  Cmax  value  of  0.3  ng/ml,  corresponding  to  a  maximal  plasma  concentration  of 3.5x10 -11 M. At this concentration, PTH did not have a significant negative inotropic effect.

## · Safety pharmacology

The potential for QT-prolongation was investigated in two in vitro tests PTH tested negative in the hERG-test and in isolated dog Purkinje fibres. The analytical part of these studies did not  meet  GLP  requirements.  In  non-GLP  cardiovascular  studies  in  anaesthetised  and conscious rat and anaesthetised dog, PTH had no effects on heart rate and blood pressure at clinically relevant doses. ECG recordings revealed no adverse effects on cardiac conduction in the repeat-dose toxicity study in monkey.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were not conducted. Pharmacokinetics (PK) Two different  immunoassays  were  used  to  quantify  PTH.  The  antibody  used  initially  was subsequently  shown  to  lack  specificity  for  full-length  PTH  as  at  least  two  biologically important PTH fragments (3-84 and 7-84) were shown to cross-react in the assay. Therefore, a new assay was developed which did not cross-react with these fragments. The latter assay, which employed a mixture of 125 I-labelled  polyclonal  anti-PTH(1-34)  and  anti-PTH(44-88) antibodies, was validated for the quantification of PTH in rat plasma and monkey serum and used  for  the  intravenous  (IV)  PK  and  absolute  bioavailability  studies  as  well  as  the  rat carcinogenicity study. Since the PK program was limited in scope and a validated assay was used in all pivotal investigations, this is an acceptable approach. · Absorption- Bioavailability PK parameters were determined in rat, dog and monkey in several single-dose studies and in the  course  of  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies.  Absolute  bioavailability  of  SC  injected  PTH was not determined in dog and monkey. In the rat, it was in the order of 50%, with about 95% of the bioavailable dose being absorbed from the skin within 90 min. Plasma levels peaked within  15  min  of  injection.  As  is  often  the  case  with  SC  administration,  Cmax  values  were underproportional to the magnitude of single doses, whereas both Cmax and AUC values were significantly greater after multiple daily doses than after a single dose. Both values, however, stabilised after 28 days of treatment and then remained constant through at least 12 months. Dog  had  a  more  blunted  and  prolonged  profile  than  rat  or  monkey,  and  inter-individual variability was substantial. In cynomolgus and rhesus monkey, Tmax ranged from 20-40 min. Dose-normalised  Cmax  and  AUC  values  were  in  between  those  of  the  rat  and  dog,  but remained  fairly  constant  in  repeat-dose  studies;  the  dose-normalised  AUC  values  were comparable to those observed in humans. There were no appreciable gender differences in any parameter. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## · Distribution

Conventional  distribution  studies  were  not  conducted  and  are  not  required.  In  the  rat,  the volume  of  distribution  was  0.05-0.10  l/kg,  or  slightly  larger  than  the  plasma  volume.  The corresponding value in humans was approximately 0.08 l/kg.

## · Metabolism ( in vitro/in vivo )

Metabolism studies were not conducted and are not required. Data from the literature shows that  PTH is rapidly cleared from plasma, primarily by Kupffer cells in the liver [23]. PTH

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

binds to a transporter on the surface of these cells that recognises an amino acid sequence within  the  28-48  amino  acid  domain  [23].  Hepatic  hydrolysis  is  catalysed  by  nonspecific peptidases  as  its  primary  clearance  pathway.  Following  hydrolysis  in  the  liver,  C-terminal fragments are released into the systemic circulation, while N-terminal fragments are degraded in situ and are not released from the Kupffer cells [24-29]. To a lesser extent, PTH is cleared by filtration and reabsorption by the kidney. In the kidney tubules, PTH and its fragments are further hydrolysed to smaller fragments to facilitate reabsorption and natural conservation of amino nitrogen.

## · Excretion

Excretion studies were not conducted.

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

Single-dose toxicity was investigated in mice and rat. The minimum lethal dose was &gt; 10 mg/kg SC in both species. · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) Repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in SD rat, dog and cynomolgus monkey. In all studies, PTH was administered once daily by SC injection. In preliminary studies over 7-21 days,  the  maximal  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  was  1000 µ g/kg/day  in  rat  and  20 µ g/kg/day  in monkey.  In  dog,  a  pyramid  and  two  preliminary  28-day  studies  were  conducted.  Overall, these  dog  studies  identified  a  no  observed  effect  level  (NOEL)  based  on  kidney  toxicity equivalent  to  0.1 µ g/kg/day  in  males  and  1.0 µ g/kg/day  in  females,  which  is  below  the proposed  human  dose.  The  observed  renal  toxicity  was  characterised  by  tubular  dilatation, regeneration  and  mineralization  with  interstitial  fibrosis  and  correlated  with  the  degree  of treatment-induced hypercalcaemia. The sensitivity of the dog to PTH-induced hypercalcaemia and  subsequent  renal  damage  precluded  the  use  of  this  animal  as  a  non-rodent  species. Therefore, pivotal studies were conducted in SD rat and cynomolgus monkey. SD rat were also employed in the primary pharmacology studies and shown to exhibit pharmacodynamic effects  at  the  MTD.  Rhesus  rather  than  cynomolgus  monkey  were  used  for  primary pharmacology. Pharmacodynamic effects in the pivotal repeat-dose study in the cynomolgus monkey were limited to a small increase in BMD in the proximal and distal femur and 2 nd -4 th lumbar vertebrae in mid-dose females. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the pivotal rat study, the test compound was administered SC for 26 weeks at 0, 50, 300 or 1000 µ g/kg/day. Major findings in the mid- and high-dose group included death, heart and kidney mineralization, abnormal reed blood cells parameters, a slight increase in blood urea nitrogen in high-dose males, a dose-dependent increase in urine calcium, a decrease in urine phosphorus,  and  increases  in  adrenal,  kidney,  and  liver  weights.  Histological  changes included  a  dose-dependent  osteosclerosis  of  the  femur  and  sternebrae  with  secondary  bone marrow  reduction  and  extramedullary  haematopoesis,  and  increased  mineralization  and tubular  regeneration  of  the  kidneys  of  male  and  female  rat.  PTH  elicited  a  weak  immune response in rats as measured by anti-PTH antibody titers. However, the frequency of antibody formation was low and had no observed effect on the pharmacological responses. Based on the results of this study, the nonthreshold effects limit (NTEL) in the rat was 50 µ g/kg/day.

In the monkey study, the test compound was administered SC for 26 weeks at 0, 2, 10 or 30 µ g/kg/day,  with  a  4-week  recovery  period.  Decreases  in  serum  phosphorus  concentrations were  noted  during  the  latter  half  of  the  study.  Elevations  in  serum  calcium  levels  were transient and minimal throughout the study. Doses ≥ 10 µ g/kg/day caused slight or mild, focal or multifocal renal tubular mineralization in some animals. Low-titer antibodies specific for PTH were detected in a single female monkey in the high-dose group at week 25. Based on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the results of this study, the NTEL in cynomolgus monkey was 2 µ g/kg/day. In summary, the most significant target organ in both species was the kidney.

## · Genotoxicity

PTH was tested for mutagenic potential in two conventional in vitro tests in bacteria and mammalian cells, respectively. PTH tested negative in both tests.

## · Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity  studies  were  conducted  in  Fischer  344  rat  and  included  a  modified  2-year bioassay and a mechanistic study of the effect on osteoblast proliferation and bone formation. In the long-term study, rats were treated SC with 0, 10, 50 or 150 µ g/kg/day of PTH for 94104 weeks. Two separate control groups were employed and an additional high-dose group was added to begin dosing at 8 months of age to determine the impact of endochondral bone growth on the incidence of neoplasia. The only statistically significant tumour finding was a dose-related  increase  in  the  frequency  of  bone  tumours  in  mid-  and  high-dose  animals  of either sex. In comparison to pooled control group incidences, high-dose males had statistically significant increases in terms of  osteoblastoma,  osteoma,  osteosarcoma  and  all  bone neoplasms. High-dose females showed a similar pattern, except that the incidence of osteoma did  not  attain  statistical  significance.    In  the  mid-dose  group,  using  the  same  comparator, osteosarcoma and all bone neoplasms were significantly increased in males, and osteoblastoma and all bone neoplasms in females. When started at 8 months of age, there was a notable reduction in bone tumor incidence in males whereas the incidence in females was equivalent  in  both  groups.  AUC  values  were  lower  in  females  than  in  males  and  exposure measurements  taken  within  the  first  month  were  lower  than  those  at  6  and  12  months. Therefore, exposure ratios were calculated separately for each sex from the average 6 and 12month AUC values at the NTEL based on all bone neoplasms (10 µ g/kg/day) and the average AUC in humans receiving 100 µ g/day (0.8 ng.hr/mL). The resulting safety margins were 6 and  4  based  on  male  and  female  rats,  respectively.  In  the  mechanistic  study,  groups  of  4 normal  3-month-old  Fischer  344  rats  were  treated  SC  with  either  rhPTH(1-84)  10  or  50 µ g/kg/day  or  rhPTH(1-34)  5  or  30 µ g/kg/day  for  14-18  days  to  compare  their  effects  on serum  osteocalcin  levels,  osteoblast  progenitor  proliferation  as  determined  by  5-BrdU labelling,  osteoblast  density  and  cancellous  bone  formation.  The  study  concluded  that rhPTH(1-34) was more effective at increasing osteoblast number and bone formation whereas osteoblast progenitor proliferation was stimulated to the same extent by either hormone. · Reproductive and developmental studies Medicinal product no longer authorised

Since the proposed indication for PTH is restricted to postmenopausal women, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies are not required. The Applicant nevertheless conducted a conventional Segment I study in which male and female rats were injected SC with 0, 100, 300  or  1000 µ g/kg/day  of  PTH.  Treatment-related  findings  in  females  included  small  but significant  reductions  in  the  number  of  corpora  lutea,  implantation  sites  and  live  fetuses  in mid- and high-dose animals. In males, they included reduced absolute and relative prostate and cauda epididymis weights and a slight decrease in group mean sperm motility percentages in high-dose animals. There was a slight reduction in body weight gain in high dose males, but this was less than 10% and therefore not indicative of general toxicity. Thus, the NTEL for females was 100 µ g/kg/day and the NTEL for males 300 µ g/kg/day.

## · Local tolerance

Conventional  non-clinical  local  tolerance  study  was  not  conducted.  An  assessment  of  the local  irritation  at  the  injection  sites  was  conducted  in  both  the  rat  and  monkey  26-week studies. In the rat study, at the highest dose, 1000 µ g/kg/day, there was an increased incidence and  severity  of  interstitial  fibrosis  at  the  injection  site.    The  concentration  of  PTH  at  the highest dose was 2 mg/ml (concentration of PTH in the proposed clinical formulation is 1.14

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mg/ml).    The  dosing  volume  in  the  rat  study  was  0.5  ml/kg  compared  to  0.001  ml/kg  for humans. In the 26-week monkey study, the histological observations at some of the injections sites in the control and PTH-treated animals included hemorrhage and/or cellulitis.

## · Other toxicity studies

Anti-PTH antibodies were determined in the course of the repeat-dose toxicity studies. In a study of the hemolytic potential of PTH for human whole blood the compatibility of PTH with human serum and plasma were investigated. There was no haemolysis precipitation or coagulation observed when either PTH (1.4 mg/ml) or vehicle were mixed with human whole blood, serum or plasma.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

No environmental risk assessment was submitted.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

Pharmacology Two  primary  pharmacodynamics  pivotal  studies  were  conducted,  one  in  rat  and  one  in monkey, in which the effects of PTH on bone mineral density, strength and architecture were studied. Treatment with PTH for 12 months in rat resulted in a dose-related gain in bone mass at trabecular and cortical bone sites, associated with increased bone strength. In monkey, PTH treatment  for  39  weeks  increased  markers  of  bone  turnover.  Formation  markers  were increased to a greater extent than resorption markers. Also, treatment with PTH at 25 µ g/kg for  16  months  resulted  in  significant  increases  in  trabecular  bone  mass  and  increases  in vertebral and femoral neck bone strength. PTH influenced cardiac tissue contractility in vitro but the effects occurred at concentrations exceeding those occurring in  vivo .  Therefore,  the  negative  inotropic  effect  of  PTH in  vitro was considered not clinically relevant. The  chosen  clinical  dose  was  1.5 µ g/kg/day  PTH  in  patients.  Based  on  pharmacokinetics (AUC), the clinical dose corresponds to exposures 1.75, 2.5 and 9.3 times less the exposures obtained  in  the  pivotal  monkey  study  (5,  10  and  25 µ g/kg/day).  Since  5 µ g/kg/day  was effective in increasing trabecular bone mass values to sham-vehicle levels but still displayed negative effects on cortical bone, the lower clinical dose was considered reasonable. PTH tested negative in two in vitro QT-prolongation tests. PTH was considered unlikely to be associated with any clinically relevant risk of QT-prolongation. Medicinal product no longer authorised

There is published evidence of a link between PTH exposure and left ventricular hypertrophy with  ensuing  cardiovascular  morbidity  and  mortality  [34,  35].  Concerns  over  potential cardiovascular  effects  of  PTH  appear  to  be  relevant  only  when  PTH  concentrations  are sufficiently  high  to  produce  a  catabolic  effect  on  bone,  and  so  the  fact  that  PTH  given intermittently  to  patients  produced  a  pronounced  anabolic  effect  is  in  itself  reassuring. Furthermore, data from the phase III clinical trials conducted with PTH showed no clinically important  effects  on  cardiovascular  function  (see  clinical  safety  section),  and  mean  PTH concentrations tended to be slightly lower in treated patients compared to levels in patients in the  placebo  group.  No  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  were  conducted  with medicinal products that may be concomitantly administered with PTH. Non-clinical findings suggested  that  PTH-receptor  agonists  may  interact  with  oestrogen  receptor  agonists  and modifiers  and  growth  hormone,  but  not  with  bisphosphonates  and  1,25-dihydroxyvitamin. The available non-clinical and clinical literature indicates that concurrent HRT and SERM use does  not  influence  the  anabolic  response  to  PTH,  whereas  concomitant  alendronate  use clearly  blunts  or  abolishes  the  increase  in  markers  of  bone  formation  and  BMD  (see  SPC section 4.5).

Pharmacokinetics

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

PK parameters were determined in rat, dog and monkey in several single-dose studies and in the  course  of  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies.  The  serum  Cmax  and  tmax  values  were  not significantly different between the neck and tail injection sites, suggesting that the lymphatic system does not play an important role in the uptake of PTH from a subcutaneous injection site.  In  dog  absorption  was  much  slower  than  in  rat  and  the  tmax  was  considered  to  be  on average 1.5 hour for both sexes. Studies performed with monkey revealed that the absorption was slower than in rat, and tmax values ranged from 35 to 1.5 hour (average 50 minutes) for both sexes.

Conventional distribution studies were not conducted and are not required [36]. The expected consequence of metabolism of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals is the degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids. Therefore, the metabolic pathways are generally understood. Biotransformation studies as performed for pharmaceuticals are not required [36]. It is unknown whether PTH is excreted in the milk of lactating animals (see SPC section 5.3). Such  knowledge  is  irrelevant,  as  long  as  the  use  of  PTH  is  restricted  to  postmenopausal women.  However,  section  4.6  of  the  SPC  includes  a  recommendation  for  not  using  PTH during  breast-feeding.  The  potential  for  PK  drug  interactions  was  not  investigated  but  is considered  remote  in  view  of  the  metabolic  pathways  described  above  and  the  expected plasma level of the drug product (Cmax &lt; 10 -10 M).

## Toxicology

Repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in SD rat, dog and cynomolgus monkey. Overall, the  dog  studies  identified  a  NOEL  based  on  kidney  toxicity  equivalent  to  0.1 µ g/kg/day in males and 1.0 µ g/kg/day in females, which is below the proposed human dose. The observed renal  toxicity  was  characterised  by  tubular  dilatation,  regeneration  and  mineralization  with interstitial  fibrosis  and  correlated  with  the  degree  of  treatment-induced  hypercalcaemia. Whereas  the  safety  margin  determined  in  rats  was  not  a  cause  for  concern,  the  low  value determined in monkeys (0.5 based on conservative criteria) indicated a potential for kidney toxicity in humans. It was therefore considered appropriate that section 5.3 of the SPC states that  in  monkeys  receiving  daily  subcutaneous  doses  for  6  months,  there  was  an  increased occurrence of renal tubular mineralization at exposure levels below clinical exposure levels.

The major findings in the pivotal rat study, included death, heart and kidney mineralization, abnormal RBC parameters, a slight increase in BUN in high-dose males, a dose-dependent increase in urine calcium, a decrease in urine phosphorus, and increases in adrenal, kidney, and liver weights. Histological changes included a dose-dependent osteosclerosis of the femur and  sternebrae  with  secondary  bone  marrow  reduction  and  extramedullary  haematopoesis, and increased mineralization and tubular regeneration of the kidneys of male and female rat. Based  on  the  results  of  this  study,  the  NTEL  in  the  rat  was  50 µ g/kg/day.  In  the  monkey study,  doses ≥ 10 µ g/kg/day  caused  slight or mild, focal or multifocal renal tubular mineralization in some animals. Based on the results of this study, the NTEL in cynomolgus monkey was 2 µ g/kg/day.

In vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells showed that PTH did not produce in vitro mutagenicity. Carcinogenicity studies in rat treated with near lifetime daily injections showed dose  dependent  exaggerated  bone  formation  and  an  increased  incidence  of  bone  tumours, including  osteosarcoma,  most  probably  due  to  an  epigenetic  mechanism.  Due  to  the differences  in  bone  physiology  in  rats  and  humans,  the  clinical  relevance  of  these  findings was considered minor. No osteosarcomas have been observed in clinical trials (see section 5.3 SPC). However, until further clinical data becomes available, it is recommended in section 4.4 of the SPC that the treatment time does not exceed 24 months. A test for chromosome aberrations was not conducted; however, this is not required for biotechnology-derived drugs as  it  is  not  expected  that  these  substances  would  interact  directly  with  DNA  or  other chromosomal material [36].

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since the proposed indication for PTH is restricted to postmenopausal women, the absence of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies was considered acceptable. However, section 4.6 of the SPC includes a recommendation for not using PTH hormone during pregnancy.

In the pivotal repeat-dose rat study, there were minimal to moderate hemorrhage, fibrosis and cellulitis at the injection site in both control and high-dose groups, with increased severity at the  high  dose.  A  conventional  local  tolerance  study  with  the  final  formulation  was  not conducted, but was not considered necessary, given the negative findings in the repeat-dose toxicities and the available clinical data. (see also SPC section 5.3).

The frequency and intensity of antibody formation was low in rat and minimal in monkey and did not compromise the interpretation of the non-clinical safety studies.

The  drug  substance  and  drug  product  contain  three  impurities  whose  proposed  release specifications  and/or  shelf  life  limits  exceed  the  qualifications  thresholds  stipulated  in  ICH Q3A/B,  namely  Met8[ox]PTH,  Met18[ox]PTH  and  PTH(1-80).  For  these  impurities,  the proposed upper (shelf life) limit is 1, 2 and 2%, respectively. While PTH(1-80) has actually been  tested  at  this  level,  batches  used  for  non-clinical  studies  probably  contained as  little as 1/5 of the proposed limit for Met8[ox]PTH and Met18[ox]PTH. The Applicant argues that the Met[ox] impurities have been qualified at the proposed limit (or higher) since the safety margins in the long-term repeat-dose studies in rat and monkey were 11 and 19, respectively. Based on conservative criteria, however, the safety margin in monkey was less than 1 and therefore this argument is untenable. Since oxidised methionine (sulfoxide and sulfone) residues  are  found  in  many  processed  foods  and  have  no  known  toxic  effect  in humans  [30-32],  it  is  nevertheless  considered  unnecessary  to  conduct  further  non-clinical studies to qualify these impurities. Since  PTH  is  a  naturally  occurring  peptide  hormone,  the  absence  of  environmental  risk assessment was considered acceptable [38]. Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements (see SPC section 6.6). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 1.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

## GCP

The clinical trials were preformed in accordance with GCPO as claimed by the applicant. The applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetics  of  PTH  has  been  evaluated  in  two  bioavailability  studies  in  healthy subjects with both intravenous administration of PTH and subcutaneous administration in the abdomen  and/or thigh. In addition, for characterisation of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic  properties  of  PTH,  four  phase  I  studies  were  conducted  in  healthy postmenopausal women in order to determine safety and pharmacokinetics, and two studies were conducted in non-osteoporotic men and women with either renal or hepatic impairment. One  phase II study was conducted in younger, healthy men  to determine relative bioequivalence. Three sub-studies of larger population studies in postmenopausal osteoporotic women  were  conducted  in  order  to  determine  population  pharmacokinetics  and  acute calcaemic response to treatment with PTH. No PK study with radiolabelled PTH has been carried out. Consequently, the observed PTH levels are the result of the sum of the natural occurring PTH plus the exogenous fraction. PTH concentrations in serum or plasma were assayed with immunoradiometric assay. · Absorption Bioavailability Table 1 - Summary of bioavailability and bioequivalence studies Study Objective Absolute BA subcutaneous dosing Medicinal product no longer authorised

Study  CL1-11-013 was  a  phase  I  pharmacokinetic  and  bioavailability  study  conducted  to determine  the  pharmacokinetics  of  a  single  100 µ g  dose  of  PTH  administered  as  an intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection in order to evaluate the subcutaneous absolute bioavailability  of  PTH  in  healthy  postmenopausal  women.  The  study  was  an  open-label, randomised, 2-way crossover with a 1-week washout between treatments. The mean absolute bioavailability of subcutaneously injected PTH was 55% with a range of 36% to 92%. Despite the substantially lower PTH exposure (Cmax and AUC0-24), the systemic calcium response was greater following subcutaneous compared with intravenous dosing. Study CL1-11-007 was a phase I injection site bioavailability study. This study was designed as a randomised, 3-way crossover study with a 7-day washout period between treatments. All patients received 3 subcutaneous injections, 2 in the abdomen and 1 in the thigh. The primary objectives of the study were to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles and bioavailability of PTH following a single 100 µ g dose administered subcutaneously in the abdomen or thigh of healthy postmenopausal women, and to assess intra-subject variability. Subcutaneous  injection  in  the  thigh  produced  lower  PTH  concentrations  initially  but  more sustained  concentrations  at  later  time  points  compared  with  subcutaneous  injection  in  the abdomen.    The  mean  Cmax  following  injection  in  the  thigh  was  nearly  half  that  observed following injection in the abdomen, while the overall exposure to PTH was similar between the 2 injection sites.  The decline from the peak concentration was slower after administration in  the  thigh,  suggesting  that  a  rate  of  absorption  was  slower  and  more  prolonged  for  this injection  site.  Despite  the  lower  peak  PTH  concentrations  observed  after  injection  in  the thigh,  the  peak  systemic  calcium  response  was  similar  between  treatments.    However,  the longer  duration  of  PTH  concentrations  following  injection  in  the  thigh  resulted  in  a correspondingly longer duration of the calcium response.

A population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model was developed to estimate the PK parameters of PTH and to investigate possible covariate-parameter relationships within the population. The final  population  model  was  a  one-compartment  model  with  first-order  absorption  and elimination parameterized in terms of CL/F, V/F, and BL, when ka was fixed at 1.5 hr-1. The typical  values  for  CL/F,  V/F,  and  BL  of  PTH  are  130  L/hr,  269  L,  and  18.8pg/mL.  The covariates examined included age, race, weight, height, BMI, serum creatinine, serum total calcium,  hepatic  enzymes,  injection  site,  smoking  history,  concomitant  therapy,  BMD, creatinine  clearance,  postmenopausal  fracture  incidence,  and  years  postmenopausal . The pharmacokinetics of PTH, after subcutaneous injection, is highly variable but consistent with the  values  obtained  in  other  studies. A significant  association  between  creatinine  clearance and  volume  was  observed. CL/F  is  not  significantly  affected  by  any  of  the  covariates; however, associations were suggested with the covariates BMD and injection site.

## Bioequivalence

Study  Astra  SH-PTH-0001  was  a  phase  I,  single-dose,  open-label,  randomised,  2-way crossover study with a 28-day washout period between treatments to compare the pharmacokinetics of single 100µ g subcutaneous injection of a phase II and III formulations in the abdomen of 43 healthy male subjects randomised to 1 of 2 treatment sequences.

The  AUC0-24  values  were  10%  higher  for  the  phase  III  formulation  than  for  the  phase  II formulation.    The  90%  CI  for  the  ratio  of  AUC0-24  values  for  the  phase  III  and  phase  II formulation  was  1.08  to  1.15.  Cmax  values  were  17%  higher  on  average  for  the  phase  III formulation than for the phase II formulation. The 90% CI for the ratio of Cmax values for the phase III formulation to the phase II formulation was 1.08 to 1.27, which exceeded the upper limit for establishing bioequivalence. The mean half-life (phase II, 2.4 hours; phase III, 2.5 hours) and tmax values (phase II, 0.47 hours; phase III, 0.56 hours) were also similar for both formulations.

The  mean  serum  calcium  profiles  following  the  administration  of  both  formulations  were similar.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

· Distribution Study CL1-11-013, which involved intravenous administration of the medicinal product as a 15-minute  infusion,  showed  that  the  volume  of  distribution  at  steady  state  following intravenous  injection  was  approximately  5.4l.  Inter-subject  variability  in  the  volume  of distribution of PTH was about 40% (see also SPC section 5.2). · Elimination No specific  metabolism  studies  in  humans  were  performed  with  PTH. In  vivo and in  vitro studies available in the literature have demonstrated that the clearance of PTH is primarily a hepatic process with a lesser role played by the kidneys [24, 39-45]. Circulating PTH is taken up in the liver by an efficient transporter on the surface of Kupffer cells [23]. Either during the  uptake  of  PTH  into  the  Kupffer  cell  or  within  the  cell  itself,  PTH  is  cleaved  by  nonspecific  proteases  into  N-  and  C-terminal  fragments  [24,  29,  41,  42,  45].  The  C-terminal fragments are released back into the systemic circulation, but  the N-terminal fragments are retained and undergo further transformation and degradation within the cell [46-48]. The ratio of  C-terminal  fragments  to  intact  hormone  is  regulated  by  systemic  calcium  concentrations and  clearance  pathways  [49-53].  C-terminal  fragments  of  PTH  released  to  the  circulation following hepatic metabolism are cleared exclusively by renal processes [25-27]. Following glomerular  filtration  and  peri-tubular  secretion  [26],  the  fragments  are  further  metabolised during tubular reabsorption [29, 54, 55]. Since the C-terminal fragments are primarily cleared by the kidney, these fragments can accumulate in patients with diminished renal function. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In studies PBR930811 (single dose) and PBR930812 (multiple doses) PTH was administered adjusted by body weight at doses between 0.02 to 5.0 µ g/kg to postmenopausal women. The PK  relationship  between  dose  and  systemic  exposure  for  PTH  was  both  linear  and proportional after single and multiple administrations in the whole range of studied doses. A similar  dose-response  relationship  was  observed  for  serum  calcium  concentrations,  serum ionised calcium, AMPc and calcium/ creatinine ratio.  There was no apparent carry-over from one dosing period to the next.

The plasma concentration data from the long-term studies (CL1-11-006 and the ACR substudy  of  N01-AR-9-2245;  PaTH)  showed  that  there  was  no  accumulation  and  no  apparent change in the pharmacokinetics of PTH after 12 to15 months of daily therapy.

## · Special populations

## Impaired renal &amp; hepatic function

One  open  label,  single  dose,  multicentre  study  (CL1-11-0010)  was  conducted  in  order  to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on bioavailability / pharmacokinetics.

The  mean  maximum  concentration  (Cmax)  and  mean  baseline-corrected  Cmax  of  PTH following 100µg PTH to patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment was approximately 22% and 23%, respectively, higher than that observed in subjects with normal renal function. The variability  of  Cmax  was  high,  with  CV%  estimates  of  77%  to  81%,  for  subjects  with mild-to-moderate renal impairment and 63% to 67% for subjects with normal renal function. Exposure  to  PTH  as  measured  by  AUC  (0-last)  and  baseline-corrected  AUC  (0-last)  was approximately  3.9%  and  2.5%,  respectively,  higher  than  that  observed  for  subjects  with normal  renal  function.  The  variability  of  AUC  (0-last)  was  moderate  to  high,  with  CV% estimates of 35% to 49% for subjects with mild-to-moderate renal impairment and 54% to 79% for subjects with normal renal function.

One  open  label,  single  dose  study  (CL1-11-0019)  was  conducted  in  order  to  evaluate  the effect  of  hepatic  impairment  on  bioavailability/pharmacokinetics.  The  mean  baseline  PTH concentrations  (Cbase)  were  similar  between  the  hepatic  function  groups.  Subjects  with normal function had a mean value of 19.5 pg/ml and subjects with moderate impairment had a mean value of 18.3 pg/mL. The mean and individual plasma PTH concentration-time profiles over the 24-hour sampling interval were comparable between the normal subjects and subjects with  moderate  hepatic  impairment.  The  median  time  to  reach  maximum  concentration  was slightly shorter for subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated with and without correction for endogenous levels of PTH. The mean Cmax and  baseline-corrected  Cmax  values  were  18%  to  20%  greater  in  the  moderately  impaired subjects than in those with normal function. The mean AUC0-last was similar between the groups, while the baseline corrected AUC0-last was 20% greater in the moderately impaired group. Variability was high, with coefficient of variation values ranging from 40% to 91% for these exposure parameters. Gender: No studies in this application have been performed in men with osteoporosis. Race: Race was included as a covariate in the population pharmacokinetic analysis of PTH in TOP study  patients.  Of  the  274  patients  who  had  ethnicity  data  and  were  included  in  the analysis, 92% reported their race as Caucasian. Weight: The influence of weight was not studied as an endpoint in any study. The population PK studies did not find any association between weight and pharmacokinetics.

Elderly: Age was included as a covariate in the population pharmacokinetic analysis of PTH in  TOP  study  patients.  Of  the  274  patients  who  had  age  data  and  were  included  in  the analysis, the median age was 65 (47 to 88 years). No effect of age on the clearance or volume of distribution of PTH could be established.

Children :  Since  the  intended  patient  population  is  postmenoposal  women,  there  is  no paediatric development for PTH.

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Primary and Secondary pharmacology

## Primary pharmacology

The pharmacodynamic response to PTH administration was assessed  primarily  in  terms  of changes  in  serum  total  calcium  concentrations  after  dosing.  In  addition,  serum  phosphate, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and tartrate resistant  acid  phosphatase  were  measured  along  with  urinary  calcium,  phosphate,  cyclic AMP,  deoxypyridinoline,  and  hydroxyproline  in  selected  studies.  Changes  in  BMD  and fracture rate were assessed as efficacy in clinical efficacy studies.

In 3 multiple daily dosing (7 days, and 12 and 15 months) studies, the increase in serum total calcium concentration was slower than the increase in PTH. Tmax was 6 to 8 hours for serum calcium compared with 2 hours for plasma PTH. The decline was also slower than the decline for  plasma  PTH.    The  differences  in  the  maximum  effects  on  total  serum  calcium concentrations were relatively minor compared to plasma PTH (50% lower after injection into the thigh). Intravenous dosing resulted in a peak PTH concentration roughly 24-fold greater and overall PTH exposure nearly 2-fold greater than after subcutaneous dosing.  In contrast, intravenous dosing resulted in peak serum calcium responses that were roughly 2-fold less and exposure that was also roughly 2-fold less than after subcutaneous dosing. No changes in serum  calcium  were  observed  at  PTH  doses &lt; 0.5 µ g/kg,  and  an  apparent  plateau  in  the response was observed at doses &gt; 2 µ g/kg. In  study  CL1-11-006,  there  was  an  initial  decrease  in  mean  serum  phosphate  levels  of 0.4 mg/dL after 15 months of dosing; this response is similar following placebo treatment. The nature of the response in relation to systemic concentrations of PTH indicates that other factors including absorption of dietary phosphate or diurnal variation are major contributors to the observed changes in serum phosphate. In study PBR 930812,  a  dose-dependent  increase in serum  1,25-dihydroxyvitamin  D concentrations was observed at 12 hours for 1.5- to 3.0µ g/kg doses of PTH. An increase of 11pg/mL was  also  observed  at  8  hours  post-dose.  Pre-dose,  no  significant  increases  were seen. Single  dose  or  daily  dosing  with  PTH  for  7  days,  had  no  meaningful  effect  on  markers  of bone turnover. The effects of long-term dosing with PTH on markers of bone turnover were assessed in Phase II, TOP, OLES, POWER, and PaTH studies. Increases (twice that of the placebo group) in cyclic AMP/creatinine ratio were detected in the 0- to 12-hour urine samples after single doses of 2.0 to 5.0 µ g/kg, however, no clear doseresponse relationship was observed.

Dose-dependent increases in urinary phosphate/creatinine ratios were detected in the 0- to 12hour and 24-hour urine samples for dose levels of 1.5 to 5 µ g/kg  PTH but then decreased during the remainder of the 7-day treatment period, returning to baseline after 5 to 7 days. The urinary  phosphate excretion data indicates a direct relationship between PTH exposure and the magnitude of the acute phosphaturic effect.

No data on secondary pharmacology, except those collected from phase III studies have been provided.

## Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology

Subcutaneous administration of 100 µ g of PTH into the abdomen produces a rapid increase in plasma PTH levels and achieves a peak at 1 to 2 hours after dosing. The average half life is of about  1.5 hours. The  absolute  bioavailability  of  100 µ g  of  PTH  after  subcutaneous

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

administration in the abdomen is 55% (see SPC section 5.2). The terminal elimination phase depends  on  the  absorption  rate  rather  than  the  elimination  rate.  The  overall  extent  of absorption (AUC) from an injection into the thigh was approximately the same as that of the abdomen. However, PTH absorption was slightly  slower  from  the  thigh  than  the  abdomen resulting in a plasma PTH profile that has a lower peak level and longer duration. Injection of PTH into  the  thigh  resulted  in  a  similar  but  later  maximum  effect  on  serum  total  calcium compared with injection into the abdomen. Predominant use of the thigh in patients receiving chronic therapy for 15 months seems to be associated with a greater increase in pre-dosing levels and a higher incidence of patients with values above the upper limit of normal (see also SPC section 5.2). Therefore, it has been considered that the subcutaneous injection should be administered in the abdomen only, and thus this is stated in section 4.2 of the SPC. Patients must be trained to use the proper injection techniques. Instructions are provided in section 6.6 of the SPC.

No studies assessing the influence of food intake on the PK profile of PTH have been carried out.  Taking into consideration that the drug is to be administered by SC route, no relevant impact of food intake is expected [56].

No  data  on  drug-drug  interactions  has  been  provided  [56].  Parathyroid  hormone  is  not metabolised  by,  and  does  not  inhibit,  hepatic  microsomal  drug-metabolising  enzymes  (e.g. cytochrome P450 isoenzymes). Furthermore, PTH is not protein bound and has a low volume of  distribution.  Consequently,  no  interaction  with  other  medicinal  products  would  be anticipated (see SPC section 4.5).

In vivo and in vitro studies show that the clearance of PTH is primarily a hepatic process with a  lesser  role  played  by  the  kidneys [24,  25,  39,  41-45].  A  greater  within-subject  variability was  observed  for  Cmax  than  for  AUC0-24.  Notably,  the  inter-individual  variability  with  the weight adjusted dosing schedule at dose levels close to the one finally selected (1.5µg/kg and 100 µg respectively) appears to be lower than that exhibited by the fixed dosing schedule. In individual cases, values on the second dosing occasion were higher than they were on the first occasion,  but  there  was  an  overall  decrease  in  the  mean  exposure  following  the  second administration in these patients. Restricting dosing to the abdominal wall will contribute to a reduction in this variability. No  dose  adjustment  is  necessary  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  renal  impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 80 ml/min) or mild to moderate hepatic impairment (total score of 7 to 9 on the Child-Pugh scale). There is no data available in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment and therefore PTH should not be used in these patients (see section 4.3 of the SPC). Although  no  effect  of  race  on  the  clearance  or  volume  of  distribution  of  PTH  could  be established,  the  predominance of Caucasians would have precluded the identification of an effect even if one existed. Even though no trial investigated the effect of ethnicity as primary endpoint,  there  is  no  reason  to  suspect  that  different  ethnic  backgrounds  influence  the pharmacokinetics of PTH [57]. No differences in PTH pharmacokinetics were detected with regard to age (range 47-88 years). Dosage adjustments based on age is not required (see also section 5.2 of SPC).

## · Dose response study

The selection of the dose was based on a 12-month, randomised, double blind, multicentre, parallel-group,  placebo-controlled  study  of  PTH  50,  75,  and  100  µg  in  postmenopausal osteoporotic  women  who  received  calcium  (1000  to  1500 mg/day)  and  vitamin  D3 (400 IU/day) as dietary supplements.

The main criteria for inclusion were: postmenopausal women with osteoporosis aged 50 to 75 years,  lumbar  spine  BMD  at  least  2.5  SD  below  the  mean  of  healthy  young  women  and patients with 2 measurable contiguous vertebral bodies in lumbar region L1-L4. Overall, 217

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients  were  randomised  to  receive  PTH  50  µg  (n=52),  PTH  75  µg  (n=55),  PTH  100  µg (n=55) or placebo (n=55).

The primary analysis was the change from baseline in lumbar spine L1-L4 BMD until month 12 for the ITT population. At 6 months the mean percentage increase from baseline in lumbar spine BMD was statistically significant in all PTH group but not in the placebo group (0.4 % placebo;  1.6  %  50  µg;  3.1  %  75  µg;  4  %  100µg).  However,  the  12-months  study  results confirmed the superiority of the 100µg over 75µg in terms of BMD. At that time, the mean percentage  increase  from  baseline  in  lumbar  spine  BMD  in  the  ITT  population  were significantly greater in the 100 µ g dose group (7.9%) compared with the placebo (0.9%), 50 µ g (3.1%) and 75 µ g (4.9%) dose groups.

- Main studies

## TOP study (Treatment of Osteoporosis with Parathyroid Hormone)

This was an international, multi centre, randomised (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallelgroup, phase III study to compare the effects of 18 months of treatment with PTH or placebo on the incidence of new and/or worsened thoracic and lumbar vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis receiving calcium and vitamin D3 supplements. METHODS Study Participants The main inclusion criteria were: women postmenopausal for at least 1 year, 45 years of age or  older.  If  45  to  54  years  of  age:  Dual-energy  X-ray  absorptiometry  (DXA)  BMD ≥ 3.0 standard deviations (SD) below mean peak bone mass (mPBM) of a young adult female or ≥ 2.5 SD below mPBM with at least 1 prevalent vertebral fracture. If ≥ 55 years of age: DXA BMD ≥ 2.5  SD  below  mPBM or ≥ 2.0  SD  below  mPBM with at least 1 prevalent vertebral fracture. Enrolment of patients with or without a prevalent vertebral fracture was allowed. Treatments Patients  were  randomised  to  receive  either  100µg  PTH  or  placebo  administered  as  a  daily subcutaneous injection. In addition, patients received daily oral calcium (700 mg) and vitamin D3 (400 IU) supplements. Increases in serum and urine calcium concentrations following the administration of ALX1-11 were anticipated and protocol-specified management algorithms were put in place to reduce elevated calcium levels. Objectives The primary objective was to compare the effects of 18 months of treatment with PTH or placebo on the incidence of new and/or worsened thoracic and lumbar vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis receiving calcium and vitamin D3 supplements.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of new and/or worsened vertebral fractures as assessed by spinal radiographs (X-rays). Lateral and A/P radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar spine (T4 to L4) were obtained. The primary assessment of vertebral fractures was made using a semiquantitative 4-point grading scale (0 to 3). Grade 0 (normal), Grade 1 (mild deformity),  Grade  2  (moderate  deformity),  Grade  3  (severe  deformity)  corresponded  to  no reduction ≥ 20%,  or  approximately  20-25%,  25-40%  or  &gt;40%  reduction  in  anterior  and/or middle  and/or  posterior  vertebral  height.  At  each  imaging  timepoint,  X-ray  images  were displayed  for  review  by  a  single  radiologist  who  had  no  knowledge  of  patient  identity  or medical  history.  The  radiologist  was  required  to  review  morphometric  point  placement  for each  vertebrae  and,  if  appropriate,  move  or  remove  points  to  provide  a  more  accurate assessment  of the anterior, posterior, and  midheight  of  each  vertebrae. The  fracture

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

assessment  from  previous  X-rays  by  previous  readers  was  displayed  and  allowed  the determination  of  new  or  worsened  fracture  by  semiquantitative  visual  assessment  at  the current timepoint. At the end of the study, all X-rays for each patient with a change request were subjected to a blinded over-read by a single radiologist who adjudicated the request and authorized  or  denied  the  requested  change.  A  prevalent  (pre-existing)  vertebral  fracture  at baseline was identified by semiquantitative visual grading. Semiquantitative visual analysis was  the primary method  for identifying prevalent vertebral fractures at baseline.  A morphometric  evaluation  was  used  as  a  secondary  definition  of  prevalent  fracture.  The definition of a prevalent vertebral fracture by morphometric analysis was:

- A ≥ 2.5 difference in the ratio of the A/P height or mid-height to posterior height within any 1 vertebra,
-  A ≥ 2.5  decrease  in  the  height  of  any  1  vertebra  compared  to  the  height  of  the  vertebrae above and below unless these comparison vertebrae were assessed as having a deformity. In the latter case, the vertebral height was compared to the nearest unaffected vertebra.

An incident (new or worsened) vertebral fracture was identified by a change in grade from baseline using the semiquantitative visual grading scale.

This was a double-blind study.

Secondary  efficacy  variables  were  incidences  of  vertebral  fractures  at  Month  12;  hip  and wrist; and other clinical fracture; changes in height; changes in BMD, BMC, and BMA of the lumbar  spine,  total  hip,  regional  hip  (greater  trochanter,  intertrochanter,  Ward's  triangle, femoral neck), whole body, and forearm assessed by DXA; changes in cortical and trabecular bone compartments assessed by QCT/pQCT at lumbar spine, hip, forearm, distal femur, and central  tibia  (QCT  substudy)  and  by  bone  histomorphometry  at  the  iliac  crest.  Changes  in bone turnover markers; change in quality of life; and change in pharmacoeconomic status and treatment satisfaction were also examined (data not shown). Sample size Enrolment of 2600 patients (1300 patients per treatment group) was determined to provide a power  of  at  least  90%  to  detect  a  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  based  on  the following assumptions: The 18-month fracture in the study population is 4.6-5% for patients treated with placebo, up to 20% of the patients could drop out of the study early without a fracture  so  that  the  effective  fracture  rate  would  be  3.68%  for  the  placebo  group  (assumes equal  drop  out  rates  for  the  2  treatment  groups),  up  to  20%  of  the  patients  receiving  PTH could  have  a  reduction  in  dose,  patients  treated  with  PTH  will  show  a  60%  reduction  in fracture  rate  relative  to  patents  treated  with  placebo  provided  they  continue  on  a  dose  of 100 µ g per day, patients with the reduced dosage will only show a 30% reduction in fracture relative to the patients treated with placebo.

## Statistical methods

The  vertebral  fracture  rate  for  the  placebo  group  was  estimate  to  be  4.6%  to  5%  over  18 months. The assumptions used to obtain this estimate were:

- The vertebral fracture rate among women with a previous vertebral fracture and BMD &lt; -1.7 at baseline was 15.5% over 3 years (7.75% over 18months) in the vertebral fracture arm of the fracture  intervention  trial.  Adjusting  for  the  baseline  requirements  of  BMD  &lt;-2.0  and vertebral  fracture  definition  in  the  current  study,  an  annual  vertebral  fracture  rate  of  about 6.5%  to  7%  (10%  over  18  months)  was  estimated  for  women  with  a  previous  vertebral fracture.
-  The  vertebral  fracture  rate  among  women  with  BMD  &lt;-2.5  and  no  previous  vertebral fracture is estimated to be about 25% that of the rate among women with a previous vertebral fracture or, in this study about 2.5% over 18 months (25% of 10%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 33% of women will have had a vertebral fracture at baseline and 67% will not have had a vertebral fracture. This yielded an estimated overall vertebral fracture rate of 4.9% over 18 months.

The  ITT  population  consisted  of  all  patients  randomised  and  who  received ≥ 1  dose  of double-blind study medication (i.e., the treated population). Patients who discontinued from the study without a new or worsened vertebral fracture were included in the group who had no new or worsened fractures. For time to new and/or worsened fractures, the time was censored at  the  time  of  the  last  X-ray.  Sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  to  assess  the  effect  of censoring. For the analysis of DXA variables, height, and bone turnover markers, all patients with post baseline data for a variable were included in a last-visit analysis, with their last postbaseline observation included.

The per-protocol population was the secondary analysis population analyzed for efficacy. The per protocol population consisted of all patients randomised and who received ≥ 1  dose  of double-blind study medication, and had no significant protocol violation.

The  Pearson's  Chi-square  test  was  used  to  compare  the  proportions  of  patients  who experienced a vertebral fracture in each treatment group. RESULTS Participants disposition There were 10,749 subjects screened for this study and 2,679 subjects were randomised to receive either 100 µ g PTH (1,286 patients) or placebo (1,246 patients) administered as a daily subcutaneous injection in the thigh or in 1 of 4 quadrants of the abdomen. Among the patients receiving PTH, 825 completed the study (461 discontinued) and 877 patients receiving the placebo, 877 completed the study (369 discontinued).

a patients were discontinued if they had an incident fracture; b Patients were discontinued if they exhausted the clinical management steps of the hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria algorithm, and still had an elevated serum and/or 24-hour urinary calcium level or urinary calcium-to-creatinine ratio; d Includes four patients (3 placebo, 1 PTH) with an incident lumbar vertebral fracture whose reason for discontinuation was reported as an AE.

Patients with a major protocol deviation were excluded from the per-protocol population. A total of 662 patients had at least one major protocol deviation. There were more patients in the PTH  group  with  major  protocol  deviations  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  The  most common  major  protocol  deviation  for  both  treatment  groups  was  'less  than  75%  dosing compliance over the course of the study.'

## Conduct of the study

There were 9 amendments to the clinical study protocol. Over 90% of the patients in each treatment group were randomized after implementation of Amendment 5, which changed the inclusion criteria to allow the enrolment of women with mild to moderate osteoporosis and with  no  prevalent  vertebral  fractures.  Following  randomization,  the  study  was  conducted according to the most recent, IRB-approved amendment for each patient.

As a result of the findings of osteosarcoma in a rat carcinogenicity study with teriparatide the study duration  was  reduced  from  36  months  to  18  months  and  an  open-label  extension  study  for  up  to  a maximum of 24 months (TOP plus OLES studies).

## Baseline data

Patients  from  the  ITT  population  were  mostly  Caucasian  (placebo,  84.9%;  PTH,  84.7%), between 55 and 74 years of age (placebo, 77.8%; PTH, 83.1 %), baseline mean ± SD weight, height  and  BMI  were  similar  between  treatments  groups.  Most  of  the  patients  randomised were postmenopausal for ≥ 5  years  (94.1%), with no prevalent vertebral fractures (placebo, 81.1%;  PTH,  81.6%).  Baseline  medical  conditions  and  history  data  and  concomitant medications  were  similar  between  treatment  groups.  The  mean  duration  of  bisphosphonate treatment in the placebo group was longer. There were no differences between the treatment groups in mean lumbar spine (-2.96 in the placebo group vs . -3.02 in the PTH group ), total hip, and femoral neck T-score (see table 4). Approximately 19% of patients in each treatment group had at least 1 prevalent vertebral fracture and 75% of patients with vertebral fractures at baseline had only 1 fracture. At baseline there was no difference between treatment groups in the frequency of prevalent vertebral fractures (see table 5).

## Primary endpoint

At Month 18 (primary time point) significantly fewer patients in the PTH treatment group had a new and/or worsened vertebral fracture compared with placebo: 18 patients in the PTH arm vs .  42  patients  in  the  placebo  arm  [estimated  relative  risk  ratio:  0.42  (95%  CI:  0.24,  0.72), p=0.001]. There was approximately 60% reduction in the risk of a new vertebral fracture in the PTH arm with the placebo arm.  One patient (PTH arm) had a worsened vertebral fracture at Month 18.

At Month 12, 40 patients had a new vertebral fracture (23 patients in the placebo arm vs . 17 patients  in  the  PTH  arm).  The  difference  between  the  two  groups  was  not  significant  (p  = 0.290). No patients had a worsened vertebral fracture.

The results obtained in the per-protocol population at Month 18 showed similar results with a 62% reduction in the relative risk of a new and/or worsened vertebral fracture [relative risk ratio: 0.38 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.74)] in the PTH arm compared with the placebo arm. There was a 66% reduction in the risk of a new vertebral fracture in the per-protocol PTH arm compared with placebo at Month 18 (3.33% in the placebo arm vs. 1.14% in the PTH arm, p=0.002), see table 6.

At  Month  18,  most  patients  with  a  new  vertebral  fracture  had  only  1  new  fracture.  Eight patients in the placebo treatment group compared with 1 patient in the PTH treatment group had multiple vertebral fractures at Month 18. There were more patients with moderate and severe fractures in the placebo group than in the PTH treatment group.

Hip Wrist Other b a p-values for the treatment group comparisons were derived using the Pearson Chi-square test. b Other clinical fractures includes fractures other than hip, thoracic or lumbar vertebrae, or wrist. Areal BMD, BMC, and BMA as Assessed by DXA Lumbar  spine  and  hip  DXA  scans  were  obtained  for  all  patients.  The  first  300  patients randomised at centers that had the capacity to perform whole body and/or forearm (distal onethird  of  the  radius)  DXA  scans  also  had  these  imaging  studies  conducted.  Only  Lunar  and Hologic  densitometers  were  used.  Patients  had  all  post-baseline  DXA  scans  on  the  same instrument  throughout  the  study.  Scans  were  sent  to  the  central  imaging  organisation  for review and calculation of BMD, BMC, and BMA. In  the  PTH treatment  group,  there  was  an  increase  from  baseline  in  lumbar  spine  BMD  at Month 6, which continued throughout the study. Lumbar spine BMD for placebo remained at or  below  baseline  throughout  the  study.  There  was  a  significantly  greater  percentage (p &lt; 0.001) of patients in the PTH group with increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD of 10%  or  greater  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  There  was  also  a  significantly  greater percentage (p=0.026) of patients in the placebo group with a decrease from baseline in lumbar spine BMD of 10% or greater compared with the PTH group. Quantitatively and qualitatively similar  changes  in  BMD,  BMC  and  BMA  were observed for total  hip,  femoral  trochanter, femoral intertrochanter and femoral neck Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the PTH treatment group, there was an initial decrease from baseline in total hip BMD at 6 months followed by an increase at Months 12 and 18.  Total hip BMD for the placebo group remained relatively constant for the first 6 months but then decreased gradually throughout the rest of the study period.

Ancillary analyses

## Quantitative Computed Tomography substudy

This  substudy  was  conducted  at  a  single  investigational  center.  It  was  a  longitudinal  study using  quantitative  computed  tomography  (QCT)  and  peripheral  QCT  (pQCT)  to  quantify changes  in  areal  and  volumetric  cortical  and  trabecular  bone  volume,  BMC,  BMD,  and structure at several skeletal sites in subjects treated with PTH or placebo. Skeletal sites were either  predominantly  trabecular  (lumbar  spine,  L3),  mixed  cortical  and  trabecular  (hip),  or predominantly  cortical  (distal  radius  and  mid-shaft  tibia)  in  composition.  These  endpoints were used to determine the relationships between areal and volumetric cortical and trabecular

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

BMC and BMD, and between bone mass and geometry (i.e., spatial distribution of bone) at each skeletal site.

A total of 122 patients were randomized and dosed [62 in the placebo arm, 60 in the PTH arm]; 46 patients in the placebo arm and 36 in the PTH arm completed the study.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change from baseline to Month 18 in lumbar vertebra L3 volumetric trabecular BMD (vTbBMD) measured by QCT. In the PTH treatment group, vTbBMD increased from baseline at Month 3 and this increase continued to 54.2% at Month  12,  after  which  vTbBMD  declined  to  38.3%  above  baseline  at  Month  18.  In  the placebo  group,  vTbBMD  increased  from  baseline  by  19%  at  Month  3  and  then  declined, returning  to  baseline  levels  by  Month  18.  The  change  from  baseline  in  vTbBMD  was significantly greater in the PTH treatment group than the placebo at Months 12 and 18.

## OLES study

This was an open-label extension study (OLES) of the safety and efficacy of PTH conducted in patients who participated in the TOP study. METHODS Inclusion criteria Women  who  had  completed  or  had  prematurely  discontinued  from  TOP  study  (for  study participants, see TOP Study). Treatments All patients were to receive PTH given as 100 µg daily by subcutaneous injection. Patients whose  study  drug  schedule  had  been  reduced  as  a  result  of  an  algorithm  for  managing hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria were to self-administer PTH on the same schedule as they were following at the end of TOP. Patients also received oral calcium (700 mg) and vitamin D3 (400 IU) supplements unless they had discontinued calcium supplements in TOP. Patients did  not  resume  calcium  supplementation  in  OLES  if  they  had  discontinued  calcium  as  the result of the application of a hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria management algorithm. Calcium supplements were to be resumed when PTH was discontinued at the completion of 24 months of treatment. Objectives The  primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  of  continued  dosing  with  PTH,  up  to  a maximum of 24 months, in postmenopausal osteoporotic women. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The secondary objectives were to evaluate the effects of PTH on changes in BMD, BMC and BMA at several skeletal sites, the incidence of vertebral and non-vertebral clinical fractures and changes in height, biochemical markers of bone turnover, and bone histomorphometric variables. Other measurements included quality of life, treatment satisfaction, assessments of dietary calcium intake, and immunological responses to PTH or E. coli proteins. The duration of the effect on BMD after discontinuation of PTH treatment was also evaluated.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change from baseline in lumbar (L1-L4) vertebral BMD (for secondary efficacy endpoints, see TOP study).

## Statistical methods

Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed based on the ITT population. The ITT population included all patients who received at least 1 dose of PTH. Data from patients who consented to participate in the study but did not receive open-label PTH were included in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the listings but were not included in any analyses. The per-protocol population included all patients  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  PTH    in  this  OLES  and  had  no  major  protocol deviations.

Descriptive  statistics  were  used  to  summarize  absolute  value,  change,  and  percent  change from the TOP baseline for both treatment groups [i.e. placebo/PTH and PTH/PTH], change and percent change from the OLES baseline for the placebo/PTH treatment group, and change and percent change from the follow-up baseline (OLES Month 6) for the PTH/PTH treatment group. For sample size, see TOP Study.

## RESULTS

## Study participants

A total of 1695 patients consented to participate in this study. Fourteen of them, but did not receive  study  drug.  The  remaining  1681  patients  received  open-label  PTH.  Treatment  with PTH was discontinued when a patients reached a maximum total exposure of 24 months in TOP and OLES combined. Approximately 62 % of the PTH/PTH treatment group completed 24  months  of  treatment,  and  29 % of  the  placebo/PTH  group  completed  18  months  of treatment.

Baseline data Among patients who received a bisphosphonate treatment prior to entering TOP study, the median duration of bisphosphonate treatment was similar in the placebo/PTH treatment group and the PTH/PTH treatment group. For lumbar spine, the OLES baseline mean T-scores for the  placebo/  PTH  treatment  group  were  significantly  lower  compared  with  the  PTH/  PTH treatment  group  (-3.02 vs -2.67),  and  Hologic  and  Lunar  mean  BMD  values  where significantly  lower  in  the  placebo/PTH  treatment  group  compared  with  the  PTH/  PTH treatment  group  (0.710g/cm 2 vs 0.758g/cm 2 and  0.828g/cm 2 vs 0.859g/cm 2 respectively). There were no differences between the treatment groups in total hip and femoral neck T-score and  Lunar  BMD.  Approximately  17 % of  patients  in  each  treatment  group  had  at  least  1 prevalent vertebral fracture at the TOP baseline. Most fractures were mild in severity with a comparable distribution of mild, moderate, and severe fractures in both treatment groups.

## Outcomes and estimation

Data were presented for the combined 24 months treatment in both TOP and OLES studies (see table 12 and Figure 1). Changes from baseline for the placebo/PTH treatment group were observed  on  the  baseline  values  of  OLES  study  and  for  the  PTH/  PTH  treatment  group, changes were observed from  the baseline values of the TOP study.

Percent  change  from  baseline  to  6,  12,  and  18  months  of  PTH  treatment  in  BMD  values related to the hip were qualitatively similar to those observed for the lumbar spine.

## Forearm BMD, BMC, and BMA

Forearm and whole body DXA scans were performed on the first 300 patients enrolled in the TOP study. DXA scans of the forearm were obtained only for patients who received PTH during the TOP study and for whom this imaging was done. A total loss in the forarm of 6.1% was observed from baseline in the PTH/PTH group from Month 12 through Month 18.

## Incidence of New and/or Worsened Vertebral Fractures

From the OLES baseline to Month 18, there were 6 new fractures and 1 worsened fracture in the  placebo/  PTH  group  and  2  new  fractures  and  4  worsened  fractures  in  the  PTH/  PTH group.

## Incidence of Clinical Fractures

More  patients  in  the  placebo/PTH  group  (29  patients)  than  in  the  PTH/PTH  group  (19 patients) had non-vertebral clinical fractures.

## Study N01-AR-9-2245 (PaTH)

This was a randomised, placebo-controlled, 2 year, multicentre, double-blind trial to assess the  efficacy  of  PTH  and  alendronate  (ALN)  as  monotherapy  and  in  combination  for  the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women between 55 and 85 years of age, with a bone mineral density scan (DXA) indicating T-scores below -2.5, either at the spine or the femoral neck or total hip, and with at least one additional risk factor for fracture. A total of 238  postmenopausal  women,  were  randomly  assigned  to  one  of  the  following  treatment groups: PTH 100 µg, ALN 10 mg, or the combination of both, and followed for 12 months. In

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the second year of the study women in the original PTH group were randomly assigned to receive either ALN or matching placebo, and women in the other two groups received ALN. At baseline 165 (69 % ) women had a T-score below -2.5, and 112 (47 % ) reported at least one fracture after menopause.

The objectives were to test the hypothesis that the combination of 1 year of PTH with ALN followed by 1 year of ALN alone, will increase bone mass after 2 years more than of ALN alone; to test the hypothesis that the combination of 1 year of PTH with concurrent ALN will increase bone mass more than 1 year of PTH alone; to assess if ALN begun concurrently with PTH is more effective in increasing bone mass than if ALN is initiated after 1 year of PTH; to examine  how  the  combination  of  ALN  and  PTH  influences  biochemical  markers  of  bone turnover.

The primary endpoint was the mean percentage change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD measured by DXA at Month 24. Secondary endpoints included mean percentage change from baseline in BMD at Month 12, bone quality as measured by QCT, height, and biochemical markers of bone turnover.

The  results for the primary endpoint showed  that PTH/ALN  treatment  for  2  years significantly  increased  lumbar  spine  areal  BMD  by  12%,  compared  with  PTH+ALN/ALN (8% and 11%) and ALN/ALN (8% and 6%). There was a high discontinuation rate in the PTH + placebo year 1 group (15%). In terms of mean change in hip BMD, there was a 4.5 % increase from baseline with one year of ALN compared to a 0.1 % decrease after one year of placebo. At 12 Months, the increases in lumbar spine BMD above baseline were similar in the PTH and combination-therapy groups and were smaller in the ALN group (6.3%, 6.1 % and 4.6%, respectively).  Increases  in  BMD  at  the  total  hip  were  1.9,  0.3,  and  2.8 % for  the  3  groups, respectively. Rittmaster study This study was a bibliographic study. Upon completion of the phase II (study ALX1-11-821) study, a portion of the osteoporotic women who were treated for one year with PTH 50, 75, or 100 µ g  or  placebo,  entered  a  1-year  open-label  extension  study  of  daily  ALN  10mg administration.  The  primary  objective  was  to  determine  whether  ALN  would  preserve  or enhance lumbar spine, femoral neck, and whole body BMD in patients previously treated with PTH. Seventy-five patients were enrolled, and 66 completed the 1-year extension period. There  were  statistically  significant  differences  for  lumbar  spinal  BMD  mean  percentage change from baseline in favour of PTH 75 µ g and 100µg /ALN compared with placebo/ALN.

## Power Study

This  was  a  phase  III,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group,  multicountry, multicentre study, investigating the effect of PTH in women with low bone mass on stable  oestrogen  replacement  therapy.  This  study  was  originally  designed  to  evaluate  the effect of combination therapy with HRT and PTH compared to HRT monotherapy after 12 and 24 months of treatment. Despite the fact that almost all patients discontinued the study treatment due to the published data on the risk of long-term HRT, a decision was made to terminate the study after all patients had received at least 18 months of study drug treatment. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of HRT + PTH on vertebral BMD in women with low bone mass receiving supplemental calcium and vitamin D3 for 24 months, and the duration of the effect on bone mineral density (BMD) after discontinuation of PTH. 180 patients were randomized (90 HRT, 90 HRT + PTH). The primary endpoint was percentage change from baseline to Month 12 in lumbar spine BMD. The result of the study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

regarding the principal variable shows that the mean percentage changes from baseline to 12 month  post-baseline  for  lumbar  spine  BMD  was  significantly  greater  in  the  PTH  group compared with the placebo group (7.1% vs . 1.1%, p&lt;0.001). This study confirmed the known effect of PTH on BMD and bone turnover parameters.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

The results of a 12-months dose response study confirmed the superiority of the 100 µg over 75  µg  dose  in  terms  of  change  from  baseline  in  lumbar  spine  L1-L4  BMD.  These  results supported the selection of the dose of 100 µg to be further developed in phase III trials. The dose  of  100  micrograms,  once-daily  has  been  recommended  in  section  4.2  (posology  and method of administration) of the SPC for the use of PTH.

The  TOP  study  was  the  only  trial  in  the  clinical  development  program,  which  evaluated fractures as the primary endpoint. This primary endpoint did not, however, comply with the current  CHMP  guideline  recommendations  [22]  (primary  variable  should  be  based  on  the occurrence of new axial or peripheral fractures and not worsening of previous fractures). The reason given by the applicant to combine endpoints was based on its intention to register the medicinal product in both the EU and the US. In the other clinical studies, BMD change from baseline was the primary efficacy endpoint. These approaches were endorsed by the CHMP. The TOP study was initially planned to have a follow-up of 36 months, as required in the current CHMP guidelines [22]. However, as a result of the findings of osteosarcoma in a rat carcinogenicity  study  with  teriparatide,  the  study  duration  was  reduced  to  18  months treatment  period  and  an  open-label  extension  study  (OLES)  for  up  to  a  maximum  of  24 months (see non-clinical discussion).

Of  the  2532  randomised  ITT  patients,  a  total  of  59  patients  experienced  at  least  one  new vertebral fracture, [42 (3.37 % ) in the placebo arm vs . 17 (1.32 % ) in the PTH arm]. Patients in the  PTH  treatment  group  had  a  61 % relative  risk  reduction  of  a  new  vertebral  fracture  at month  18  compared  to  the  patients  in  the  placebo  group.  To  prevent  one  or  more  new vertebral  fractures,  48  women  had  to  be  treated  for  a  median  of  18  months  for  the  total population.  For  patients  with  pre-existing  fractures,  NNT  was  21  patients.  There  was  no significant  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  in  the  incidence  of  any  non-vertebral clinical  fracture;  5.52 % for  PTH vs .  5.86 % for  placebo  (see  section  5.1  of  the  SPC). Furthermore  the  provided  analyses  of  the  incidence  of  new  vertebral  fracture  at  Month  18 showed that the inclusion of worsened fractures did not influence the efficacy data since only 1 worsened fracture was reported in the 2532 subjects treated. Although the risk reduction was higher among women without prevalent fractures (68%) than for those with prevalent fractures (53%), the most relevant absolute reduction was observed among those patients with previous fractures. In addition, the most relevant fracture reduction was observed among patients with a lumbar spine T-score of ≤ -3 (see section 5.1). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Relatively  few  patients  less  than  5  years  postmenopausal  and  45-54  years  of  age  were enrolled in the phase III study (2-3 %). The results for these patients were not different from the results in the study as a whole. However, this lack of data could affect the representativity of  the  population  included  in  the  study  and  the  extrapolation  of  the  results  to  the  target population. This issue was highlighted in section 5.1 of the SPC.

No consistent trend for the reduction in the risk of fractures was observed in patients having received  previous  treatment  with  either  biphosphonates  or  estrogens  despite  the  relevant number of patients in this sub-group.

The efficacy, in terms of reduction of fractures and BMD was lower among patients using the thigh as injection site compared with patients using the abdomen as injection site. Thus, only administration in the abdomen has been recommended in section 4.2 of the SPC.

No  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  in  the  incidence  of  any  non-vertebral  clinical fracture was observed at 18 months. Although no formal comparisons can be made, the effect

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of PTH observed on lumbar spine BMD appeared lower than the effect of other drugs having a similar mechanism of action. However, this difference did not result in a different protection pattern  against  osteoporotic  vertebral  fractures.  No  differences  were  seen  in  mean  percent change from baseline in BMA at any post-baseline time point.

In the OLES study the evaluation of the primary endpoint, showed a total increase of 6.8% in lumbar vertebral BMD from baseline at all time points in the PTH/PTH group. As the OLES study was an open-label extension of the TOP study, no valid efficacy conclusions could be derived from this analysis and it was considered as supportive only.

The results of the PaTH study were included in section 5.1 of the SPC. Based on the results of this  study,  section 4.2 of the SPC states that following treatment with PTH patients can be treated with a bisphosphonate to further increase BMD.

## Clinical safety

The safety of PTH was evaluated in 13 clinical studies (8 clinical pharmacology and 5 Phase II and III trials). Another study conducted by the investigators evaluated the study drug with a bisphosphonate after PTH in the Phase II study (Rittmaster et al., 2000). · Patient exposure A total  of  3321  patients  were  randomized  in  4  double-blind  and  1  open-label  study.  3167 patients  received  PTH.  The  studies  were  designed  to  evaluate  exposure  to  PTH  from  12 months  (phase  II)  up  to  24 months  (long-term  safety  in  TOP  and  OLES  combined).  The duration of treatment with 100 µ g PTH ranged from a median of 363 days (approximately 12 months)  in  the  phase  II  study  to  a  median  of  540  days  (approximately  18  months)  in  the placebo-controlled phase III study (TOP).  The majority of patients in the 100µ g PTH group across  all  studies  received  the  PTH  for  at  least  12  months.  The  duration  of  placebo administration in the placebo-controlled studies was similar to that of PTH. The duration of PTH treatment in the long term 24-month safety population excluded the number of days of treatment interruption between TOP and OLES. From 65% to 78% of patients who received 100 µ g  PTH completed the studies, compared with 71% to 84% of patients who received placebo. Only women were evaluated in the phase II and phase III studies, and the majority of patients across all studies were Caucasian and ranged in age from 45 to 85 years. The mean age of the patients  was  63  to  65  years  in  all  studies,  except  the  active-control  studies  (PaTH  and POWER) in which the mean age was 58 to 70 years.

- Adverse events (AE)

Systemic  adverse  events  (headache,  nausea,  arthralgia,  back  pain,  nasopharyngitis,  pain  in extremities,  influenza,  and  dizziness),  laboratory  abnormalities  reported  as  adverse  events (hypercalciuria and hypercalcaemia), and injection site adverse events were reported. About 71% of patients receiving PTH reported at least one drug reaction.

## Systemic adverse events

Compared with placebo, headache was reported with a higher incidence in patients receiving PTH in the pooled placebo-controlled studies (23% vs . 29%, respectively). There was a doseresponse relationship for nausea, with the incidence increasing with increasing dose (7% of patents in the placebo group vs. 22% of patients in the 100 µ g PTH group). Compared with placebo, nausea was reported with a higher incidence in patients receiving PTH in the pooled

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

placebo-controlled  studies  (9%  of  patients vs .  23%,  respectively).  Nausea  was  considered related to the treatment in 13.5% of the patents receiving PTH. The incidence of nausea was twice  as  high  when  PTH  was  administered  in  combination  with  HRT  compared  with  PTH monotherapy;  the  incidence  was  similar  in  patients  receiving  PTH  monotherapy  compared with PTH combined with ALN.

In the pooled placebo-controlled studies, back pain was reported with a higher incidence in patients receiving placebo compared with patients receiving PTH (20% of patients vs .  19%, respectively). The incidence of back pain was higher when HRT was administered alone or in combination with PTH, compared with PTH monotherapy or in combination with ALN (18% and 21% of patients vs . 12% and 14%, respectively).

Pain  in  extremity  was  reported  with  a  higher  incidence  in  patients  receiving  PTH  or  ALN monotherapy  compared  with  patients  receiving  HRT,  PTH+ALN,  or  PTH+HRT  (18%  and 19% vs . 11%, 9% and 9%, respectively).

There  was  a  dose-response  relationship  for  dizziness,  with  the  incidence  increasing  with increasing dose (7% of patents in the placebo group vs. 16% of patients in the 100 µ g PTH group).  Compared with placebo, dizziness was reported with a higher incidence in patients receiving  100 µ g  PTH  in  the  pooled  placebo-controlled  studies  (8%  of  patients vs .  12%, respectively).  The  incidence  of  dizziness  was  approximately  twice  as  high  in  patients receiving  PTH  monotherapy  or  in  combination  with  either  ALN  (10%)  or  HRT  compared with patients receiving ALN monotherapy or HRT alone (11%, 10% and 10% vs . 5% and 6%, respectively).

Injection site haemorrhage  was  the  most  frequently  reported injection site  AE.  The investigators considered the majority of the injection site-related AEs as mild in severity and related to study drug.

Laboratory abnormalities reported as adverse events Compared  with  placebo,  hypercalciuria  was  reported  in  twice  the  proportion  of  patients receiving  100 µ g  PTH  in  the  pooled  placebo-controlled  studies  (21%  of  patients vs .  44%, respectively). There was a dose-response for hypercalcaemia with the incidence increasing with increasing dose  (placebo,  0%;  50 µ g  PTH,  2%;  75 µ g  PTH,  4%;  100 µ g  PTH,  4%).  Compared  with placebo (4 %), hypercalcaemia was reported with a higher incidence in patients receiving 100 µ g  PTH  (27%)  in  the  pooled  placebo-controlled  studies  (4% vs .  27%,  respectively). hypercalcaemia  and  hypercalciuria  was  considered  related  to  the  treatment  in  25.3%  and 39.3%, respectively, of the patents receiving PTH. PTH increased  serum  uric  acid  concentrations.  For  all  patients  who  received  PTH  100 µ g blood uric acid increase was reported for 8 patients (0.6 %) and hyperuricemia was reported for 5 patients (0.4 %).

## Antibodies to PTH and E. Coli

The immunological potential was assessed during the clinical studies by measuring antibodies to E. coli contaminating protein (ECP) as well as antibodies to PTH.  In the TOP and POWER studies,  serum  samples  were  collected  at  screening  and  at  Months  12  and  18  for  the determination of antibodies. Serum samples in the phase II study were collected at baseline and  at  Month  12.  In  the  TOP  study  a  total  of  36  patients  (3.1%)  were  positive  for  PTH antibodies in the PTH treatment group and 2 patients (0.2 %) in the placebo group. Eleven (1.0%) patients treated with placebo had ECP antibodies, compared with 5 (0.4%) patients treated with PTH. In the POWER study one patient in the PTH treatment group developed non  specific  antibodies  against  PTH  at  the  Month  12  visit  and  all  post-dose  samples  were negative for ECP antibodies.

- Serious adverse event/ deaths/ other significant events

## Serious adverse events

No serious  adverse  events  were  reported  for  patients  in  the  clinical  pharmacology  studies. Serious  adverse  events  were  reported  for  a  total  of  10  patients  (5  patients  in  the  placebo group; 2 in the 50 µ g PTH group; 1 in the 75 µ g PTH group and 1 in the 100 µ g PTH group) in the phase II study.

In the pooled placebo and PTH studies 182 patients (7.3% of patients in the placebo group; 3.9% in the 50 µ g PTH group; 1.8% in the 75 µ g PTH group and 6.3% in the 100 µ g PTH group) reported at least one serious adverse event. A higher proportion of cardiac disorders were reported as serious AEs in the placebo group (1.5%) than in the 100 µ g  PTH (0.8%) group.  Angina  pectoris  and  atrial  fibrillation  were  the  most  common  cardiac  disorders reported as serious adverse events in the placebo treatment group. No cardiac disorder was reported  as  a  serious  adverse  event  in  more  than  2 patients  in  the  100 µ g  PTH  treatment group.  Two  patients  receiving  placebo  were  reported  to  have  pancreatitis  and  1 patient receiving PTH was reported to have acute pancreatitis.

## Deaths

Fourteen  patients  participating  to  the  clinical  studies  had  adverse  events  leading  to  death. Twelve  of  these  patients  had  adverse  events  leading  to  death  after  study  drug  was discontinued.  Except  for  1  patient  in  OLES,  none  of  the  adverse  events  leading  to  death occurred on study drug. None of the deaths were reported as associated with study drug. No

patient died or had an adverse event leading to death in the clinical pharmacology studies, the phase II study or the POWER study. Three deaths were reported during TOP study.

## · Laboratory findings

## Hematology results

Across all studies, over 85% of patients in all treatment groups who had normal values for RBC parameters at baseline also had normal values at endpoint. However, in the phase II, TOP and OLES studies, almost twice as many patients in the 100 µ g PTH treatment group compared  with  the  placebo  group  had  a  shift  in  RBC  from  normal  at  baseline  to  low  at endpoint. Over 95% of patients in all treatment groups who had normal WBC and platelet count values at baseline also had normal values at endpoint.

## Clinical chemistry results

Overall, the proportion of patients with shifts from normal at baseline to high in creatinine was  similar  in  the  placebo  and  100 µ g  PTH  groups.  Over  80%  of  the  patients  in  both treatment groups in OLES and 93% in PaTH and Power, who had normal creatinine and urea values at baseline also had normal values at endpoint.

Across all  studies,  over  93%  of  patients  in  all  treatment  groups  who  had  normal  values  at baseline  for  ALT,  AST,  total  bilirubin,  GGT,  and  lactate  dehydrogenase  also  had  normal values at endpoint. A higher proportion of patients in the 100 µ g PTH treatment group had a shift  in  alkaline  phosphatase  from  normal  at  baseline  to  high  at  endpoint  than  those  in  the placebo group. A higher proportion  of  patients  in  the  PTH  treatment  groups  had  a  shift  in  serum  calcium from normal at baseline to high at endpoint than patients in the placebo group. However, over 82% of patients in all treatment groups who had a normal serum calcium level at baseline also had a normal level at endpoint. Calcium values of potential clinical importance were reported in  approximately  5%  of  subjectpatients  in  the  100 µ g  PTH  group  in  TOP  study,  3%  of patients who received placebo/100 µ g PTH and less than 1% of patients who received 100 µ g PTH/100 µ g PTH in OLES, and 2% of patients who received placebo/100 µ g PTH and 4% of patients who received HRT/100 µ g PTH, 4% in PaTH and POWER. No patient was reported to have hypocalcaemia after PTH was discontinued. There was no laboratory evidence of parathyroid gland suppression after stopping PTH. In the PaTH study, while mean serum calcium and phosphate values increased between baseline and endpoint for the  PTH  groups  in  Year  1  and  decreased  for  the  ALN  alone  group,  these  increases  were reversed when patients were switched to ALN or placebo in Year 2.  The values at the end of Year 2 were slightly below the original baseline values in these 3 treatment groups. In the group that remained on ALN throughout the study, there was no further decrease in serum calcium from the end of Year 1 to the end of Year 2. Fewer patients had shifts in calcium from  normal  at  baseline  to  high  in  Year 2  compared  to  Year  1.  Shifts  in  phosphate  were similar between Year 1 and Year 2.

## ECG results

Across all studies, over 80% of patients who had normal ECG results at baseline had normal results at endpoint. Most patients in both treatment groups had a QTc value increase of less than 30 msec from baseline to endpoint.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Age and race

There  were  no  notable  differences  between  the  age  groups  in  the  occurrence  of  the  more frequently reported adverse events. The number of patients in the respective groups was too small to reach a conclusion regarding the distribution of the more frequently reported adverse events by race category.

## Overdose

Acute accidental overdosage of PTH can result in transient hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria. In the PTH clinical program, accidental overdose was reported for 16 patients. Hypercalcaemia and/or hypercalciuria were reported for the majority of patients who had an accidental overdose of PTH.  Study drug was temporarily interrupted in these patients, and the adverse event resolved.

## · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

The use of concomitant medications was similar in the treatment groups. Compared to the pooled placebo-controlled studies, the most frequently taken concomitant medications were similar  except  for  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, thyroid hormones, and coxibs. PTH has been  administered  to  a  large  number  of  patients  who  had  received  a  broad  spectrum  of concomitant  medications  that  would  be  expected  due  to  the  population  studied  and  the underlying medical problems. No potential for drug interactions was identified. · Discontinuation due to adverse events A total of 3167 patients were randomised to the TOP, phase II, POWER and PaTH studies. Of these, 2712  patients (70.5 %)  completed  the  studies. The  most  frequent reason for discontinuation was withdrawal of consent; the next most frequent reason was the occurrence of  adverse  events.  Higher  percentages  of  patients  discontinued  in  the  TOP  (32.8  %)  and POWER (32.8%) studies compared with the phase II (14.3%) and PaTH (5.5%) studies. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation in the PTH treatment group during the pivotal TOP study were nausea (4.4%), headache (1.4%), vomiting (1.1%), and dizziness (0.8%). The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation in the placebo treatment group were bone density decreased (2.2%), and vertebral fracture (0.9). In the pooled placebo and dose comparison PTH studies, gastrointestinal disorders (placebo, 1%; 100 µ g PTH, 5%), and nervous system disorders (placebo, 1%; 100 µ g PTH, 3%), lead to premature termination occurring in more than 2% of patients in either treatment group. Only 2 cardiac disorders were reported as adverse events that led to premature termination in more  than  one  patient,  myocardial  infarction  was  for  2 patients  (placebo)  and  palpitations were reported for 3 patients (100 µ g PTH). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Vascular disorders were reported as adverse events that led to premature termination in 0.2% and 1.0 % of patients in the placebo and 100 µ g PTH treatment groups, respectively. Only 2 such  events  were  reported  in  more  than  one  patient,  hot  flush  which  was  reported  in 4 patients  (placebo,  1;  100 µ g  PTH,  3)  and  hypertension  which  was  reported  in  8  patients (100 µ g PTH).

Benign  neoplasms,  malignant  and  unspecified  disorders  were  reported  as  adverse  events leading to premature termination in less than 0.5% of patients in the placebo and 100 µ g PTH groups. For this body system, only 2 adverse events leading to premature termination were reported in more than 1 patient, breast cancer (placebo, 3; 100 µ g PTH, 1) and colon cancer (placebo, 1; 100 µ g PTH, 2).

## · Discussion on clinical safety

According  to  the Note  for  Guidance  on  Postmenopausal  Osteoporosis  in  Women [22],  a duration  of  randomised  treatment  of  at  least  3  years  is  recommended  in  order  to  provide fracture  and  bone  safety  data.  However,  the  pivotal  randomised  study  TOP  was  designed before  this  guidance  document  was  made  public.  Safety  data  were  analysed  according  to subgroups,  based  on  age,  race,  and  region.  There  were  no  relevant  interactions  in  the incidence  of  adverse  events,  changes  in  laboratory  values,  or  vital  signs  based  on  the subgroup analyses.

PTH was overall well tolerated during the clinical trials. The most frequent treatment related adverse events in the phase II/III program, in which the incidence in the PTH treatment group was significantly greater than the incidence in the placebo group, were hypercalciuria (44% vs .  21%), headache (29% vs .  23%), hypercalcemia (27% vs .  4%), nausea (22% vs .  7%) and dizziness  (12% vs .  8%).  Artralgia  and  back  pain  were  reported  with  a  similar  incidence  in both groups (22% and 20% respectively).

Given the physiological profile of PTH, effects on calcium metabolic parameters in plasma were expected. Hypercalcaemia and/or hypercalciuria reflected the known pharmacodynamic actions  of  PTH  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  the  kidney  and  the  bone.  Hypercalcaemia  was transient and was reported most frequently in the first 3 months of treatment. It was managed during the clinical programme by monitoring laboratory values and the use of a pre-specified management algorithm (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC). In response to the risk of hypercalcaemia, section 4.4 of the SPC states patients initiated on PTH therapy should be monitored at months 1, 3 and 6 for elevated levels of serum and/or urinary calcium. Monitoring beyond 6 months is not recommended for patients whose total serum  calcium  is  within  the  normal  limits  at  6  months.  In  patients  with  pre-existing hypercalcaemia  and/or  hypercalciuria,  PTH  treatment  was  found  to  be  more  likely  to exacerbate the underlying hypercalcaemia and/or hypercalciuria, and therefore PTH is contraindicated in these patients (see also section 4.3 of SPC). ECG surveillance  was  carried  out  in  patients  involved  in  the  phase  II  and  III  studies.  As expected due to its effects on calcium homeostasis, no effect of the drug on QT prolongation has been observed. In the TOP study, the number of patients who had a change in QTc value of greater than or equal to 30 msec to less than 60 msec and greater than 60 were higher in the placebo/100 µ g  PTH  group  than  in  the  100 µ g  PTH/100 µ g  PTH  group.  Considering  the mechanism  of  action  of  PTH,  its  combined  use  with  cardiac  glucosides  may  predispose patients to digitalis toxicity if hypercalcaemia develops. This warning is therefore included in sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Renal  calculi  were  more  frequent  in  the  PTH  group  than  in  the  placebo  group.  Eleven patients,  8  of  them  on  PTH,  were  diagnosed  with  nephrolitiasis,  of  whom  3  (1  of  them receiving PTH) discontinued the study medication for this reason. PTH has not been studied in patients with active urolithiasis. Caution is therefore recommended in patients with active or previous urolithiasis (see section 4.4 of SPC). PTH  increases serum  uric acid concentrations. Blood uric acid increase and hyperuricaemia were reported in patients who received  PTH  100 µ g  (0.6%  and  0.4%,  respectively).  This  difference  was  statistically significant  as  compared  to  placebo.  Although  gout,  arthralgia  and  nephrolithiasis  were reported  as  adverse  drug  reactions,  the  relationship  to  elevations  in  uric  acid  due  to  PTH administration has not been fully established, as stated in section 4.8 of the SPC.

There were no changes in the renal or liver function tests between groups. However, there was a dose-dependent increase in the serum alkaline phosphatase, which might be attributable to  bone-specific  alkaline  phosphatase.  No  clinically  relevant  changes  in  serum  phosphate were  observed.  PTH  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  unexplained  elevations  in  bone-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

specific alkaline phosphatase, as well as those with severe hepatic or renal impairment (see also section 4.3 of SPC).

A small but significant decrease was observed in the red blood parameters in the PTH group, no other haematology abnormalities were identified (see also section 4.8 of the SPC).

The proportion of patients who had injection site related adverse events was similar in the PTH and placebo groups. In general, the proportion of patients who had injection site related adverse events was similar in the PTH and placebo groups. The investigators considered the majority of the injection site-related adverse events as mild in severity and related to study drug. Patients, however, must be trained to use the proper injection techniques, as stated in section 4.2 of the SPC.

In the TOP study, a total of 198 patients (8.3% in the placebo group, 7.3% in the PTH group) experienced 1 or more SAE. In the pooled placebo and PTH studies 182 patients (6,6%) were reported as having experienced at least one SAE. The most common SAE in the PTH group were hypercalcemia (0.4%) and events related to anaemia (0.4%).

Despite  the  fact  that  on  the  long  term  basis  treatment  discontinuations  with  PTH  was  not different from placebo, in almost 35% of the PTH treated patients, a dose reduction of PTH was necessary and in almost 60% the supplement of calcium had to be discontinued. Advice to alter the dose of calcium, vitamin D supplements and PTH or to stop supplementation or PTH therapy altogether been included in section 4.4 of the SPC. The immunological potential was assessed during the clinical studies by measuring antibodies to E. coli contaminating protein (ECP) as well as antibodies to PTH. Data on antibodies to PTH were not clearly presented. Although the analysis plan specified that positive samples would be analysed for neutralizing antibody activity, this analysis was not performed. Section 4.8  of  the  SPC  mentions  that  in  women  with  a  positive  titre,  there  was  no  evidence  of hypersensitivity reactions, allergic reactions, effects on BMD response, or on effects on serum calcium. A substudy of TOP was conducted in order to evaluate the effects of PTH treatment on bone using  histomophometry.  A  total  of  40  bone  biopsies  were  performed  but  only  28  were evaluable, including 10 biopsies from patients having received PTH. Within this small group, there  was  no  evidence  for  excessive  osteoid  accumulation,  mineralization  defects,  marrow fibrosis, or the appearance of abnormal cells and the new bone formed after PTH treatment had  normal  lamellar  structure  and  normal  mineralization.  The  applicant  was  proposed  to conduct investigations of bone histomorphometry and histopathology post-authorisation, and to include this commitment in the risk management plan. Medicinal product no longer authorised

PTH  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  a  know  hypersensitivity  to  PTH  or  to  any  of  the excipients in the product. It is also contraindicated in patients who have previously received radiation to the skeleton, patients with disturbances in the phosphocalcic metabolism, patients with metabolic bone diseases other than primary osteoporosis, including hyperparathyroidism and Paget's disease (see also section 4.3 of SPC).

The safety of PTH in patients under 18 years has not been studied. PTH should not be used in paediatric patients or young adults, as stated in section 4.2 of the SPC. No data are available for  the  use  of  PTH  in  pregnancy  and  lactation.  As  stated  in  section  4.6  of  the  SPC,  PTH should therefore not be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding. No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.

No specific  antidote  to  PTH  exists  and  any  overdose  should  be  managed  with  supportive therapy, as detailed in section 4.9 of the SPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As some episodes of dizziness have been described in patients treated with PTH, section 4.7 of  the  SPC  recommends  patients  should  refrain  from  driving  or  using  machines  until symptoms have subsided.

## 1.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant fulfils  the  legislative  requirements.  The  statements  provided  are  adequate  to  meet  the requirement of article ib of Directive 2001/83/EC.

## Risk Management Plan

The Applicant submitted a risk management plan. The risk management plan did not include a  risk  minimisation  plan.  The  post-  marketing  safety  surveillance  will  rely  on  standard pharmacovigilance activities based on passive surveillance and additionally, specific surveillance  activities  are  planned  post-marketing  for  addressing  potential  safety  risks  and missing information:

## 1.6 Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Quality

In general, the different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply  with  existing  guidelines.  The  fermentation  and  purification  of  the  drug  substance, have been adequately described, controlled and validated. The drug substance has been well characterised with regard to its physicochemical and biological characteristics, using state-of the-art methods, and appropriate specifications have been set. The manufacturing process of the  drug  product  has  been  satisfactorily  described  and  validated.  The  quality  of  the  drug product is  controlled  by  adequate  test  methods  and  specifications.  The  viral  safety  and  the safety  concerning  other  adventitious  agents  including  TSE  have  been  sufficiently  assured . Except for a number of quality points that the applicant agreed to address post authorisation, the overall quality of Preotact was considered acceptable.

Preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety, pharmacology, mutagenicity, toxicity to fertility and general reproduction, and local tolerance.  In  monkeys  receiving  daily  subcutaneous  doses  for  6  months,  there  was  an increased  occurrence  of  renal  tubular  mineralization  at  exposure  levels  below  clinical exposure  levels.  Rats  treated  with  near  life-time  daily  injections  had  dose  dependant exaggerated bone formation and an increased incidence of bone tumours, including osteosarcoma, most probably due to an epigenetic mechanism. Due to the differences in bone physiology in rats and humans, the clinical relevance of these findings was considered minor.

Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology The  medicinal  product  PTH  contains  recombinant  human  parathyroid  hormone  which  is identical  to  full-length  native  84-amino  acid  polypeptide.  Physiological  actions  of  PTH include  stimulation  of  bone  formation  by  direct  effects  on  bone  forming  cells  (ostoblasts), indirectly  increasing  the  intestinal  resorption  of  calcium  and  increasing  reabsorption  of calcium and excretion of phosphate by the kidney. Two  primary  pharmacodynamics  pivotal  studies  were  conducted,  one  in  rats  and  one  in monkeys, in which the effect of PTH on bone mineral density, strength and architecture was studied.  Treatment  with  PTH  for  12  months  in  rats  resulted  in  a  dose-related  gain  in  bone mass  at  trabecular  and  cortical  bone  sites,  associated  with  increased  bone  strength.  In monkeys,  PTH  treatment  for  39  weeks  increased  markers  of  bone  turnover.  Formation markers were increased to a greater extent than resorption markers. Also, treatment with PTH at  25 µ g/kg  for  16  months  resulted  in  significant  increases  in  trabecular  bone  mass  and increases in vertebral and femoral neck bone strength.

## Efficacy

The clinical efficacy of PTH in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women was supported by one pivotal phase III placebo controlled study (TOP), an open-label extension/safety study (OLES) and two phase III active control studies (PaTH, and POWER). In the pivotal study, less patients (17, 1.32%) in the PTH treatment group experienced at least one  new  vertebral  fracture  than  in  the  placebo  group  (42,  3.37%).  Patients  in  the  PTH

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment  group  had  a  61 % relative  risk  reduction  of  a  new  vertebral  fracture  at  month  18 compared to the patients in the placebo group. At Month 12 the difference between groups was not significant. The most relevant fracture reduction was observed among patients at high risk of fractures such as patients with previous fractures and/or in patients with a lumbar spine T-score of ≤ -3.

In  terms  of  effect  on  bone  mineral  density  (BMD),  the  data  obtained  in  the  pivotal  study showed  a  significant  increase  in  BMD  (6.5%)  in  the  lumbar  spine  after  18  months  of treatment  with  100 µ g  of    PTH  compared  with  placebo  (-0.3%),  p&lt;0.001.  Increases  in  hip BMD  (total  hip,  femoral  neck,  femoral  trochanter)  were  observed  at  study  endpoint (p&lt;0.001).

The efficacy, in terms of reduction of fractures and BMD was lower among patients using the thigh as injection site compared with patients being injected the PTH in the abdomen. Thus, only administration in the abdomen has been recommended in section 4.2 of the SPC.

Continued treatment for up to 24 months in the open-label extension of this study (OLES) showed a continued increase in BMD. The increase from baseline in lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD was 6.8 % and  2.2 % ,  respectively  in  patients  treated  with  PTH.  As  the  OLES  study  was  an  open-label extension of the TOP study, the results obtained in this study were considered as supportive only.

Safety The  safety  analysis  has  been  carried  out  on  a  total  of  3321  patients  randomised  in  the  4 double-blind and 1 open-label study. Including clinical pharmacology studies, 3167 patients received the study drug. Overall, PTH was well tolerated during the clinical trials. The most frequent treatment related adverse events in the phase II/III program, for which the incidence in  the  PTH  treatment  group  was  greater  than  the  incidence  in  the  placebo  group,  were hypercalciuria  (44% vs .  21%),  headache  (29% vs .  23%),  hypercalcaemia  (27% vs .  4%), nausea (22% vs .  7%)  and  dizziness  (12% vs .  8%).  Arthralgia  and  back  pain  were  reported with a similar incidence in both groups, 22% and 20% respectively, as was the proportion of patients who had injection site related adverse events. In  the  pooled  placebo  and  PTH  studies  182  patients  (6.6%)  were  reported  as  having experienced  at  least  one  serious  adverse  event.  The  most  common  SAE  in  the  PTH  group were hypercalcaemia and events related to anaemia. Considering the mechanism of action of PTH, hypercalcaemia is an expected adverse effect. In responses to the risk of hypercalcaemia, adequate recommendation to monitor patients initiated on PTH therapy has been included in the SPC. The adverse drug reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the SPC. Having considered the safety concerns described in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that  the  proposed  surveillance  activities  described  in  section  3.5  of  this  report,  adequately address the safety issues raised.

## Benefit/risk assessment

The efficacy of PTH has been documented in postmenopausal women with low BMD, with or without  prevalent  vertebral  fractures.  Patients  receiving  PTH  had  a  61%  relative  risk reduction of a new vertebral fracture at month 18 compared to patients in the placebo group. A  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  hip  fracture  has  not  been  demonstrated.  Increases  in  the lumbar spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) were observed in patients receiving PTH. Although the effect on BMD may be regarded as lower than expected, the risk reduction in vertebral  fractures  was  considered  similar  to  other  medicinal  products  with  a  similar mechanism of action.

Although  the  relative  risk  reduction  was  consistent  in  patients  with  and  without  prevalent fractures, the absolute risk reduction was much higher in patients with vertebral fractures at entry. The anti-fracture effect was observed among patients with a lumbar spine T-score of ≤ -

3, but not in patients with higher BMD scoring. In addition, patients with less than 5 years from menopause and younger than 55 years were underrepresented in the dossier. Thus, to reflect  the  actual  study  population  in  the  indication,  the  applicant  revised  the  claimed indication, after discussion at the CHMP, limiting it to patients at high-risk. Also, the efficacy profile  being  numerically  different  depending  on  the  site  of  administration,  the  mode  of administration has been limited to subcutaneous injection in the abdomen.

A randomised study (PaTH) showed that sequential treatment with PTH for one year followed by ALN for a further year was associated with a therapeutic benefit in terms of increase in BMD, and suggested that additional therapeutic intervention should be considered following discontinuation of PTH. Although these results were obtained with ALN, the conclusion was extrapolated  to  other  bisphosphonates,  considering  the  well  characterised  anti-resorptive action of all bisphosphonates.

In terms of safety, PTH was overall well tolerated during clinical trials. More patients treated with 100 µ g PTH reported hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia, and nausea as compared to other treatment groups. These adverse events were considered related to the treatment. The CHMP, having considered the safety data and the risk management plan submitted, was of the opinion that a number of pharmacovigilance activities, in addition to the routine pharmacovigilance activities, were needed to further investigate cases of hypercalciuria and hypercalcamia, bone histomorphometry, and cases of wrist and other non-axial fractures.

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by concensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Preotact  in  the  treatment  of  osteoporosis  in postmenopausal women at high risk of fractures was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
