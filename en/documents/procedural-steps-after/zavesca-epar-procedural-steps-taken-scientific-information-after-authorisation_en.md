| II/0034 | The MAH updated sections 4.4, 4.7, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to include new information on the results from clinical studies performed in fulfilment of two specific obligations. The Package Leaflet (sections 2 and 4) was updated in accordance. Annex II, section IIC, was updated accordingly to reflect the requested fulfilment of the specific obligations SO2 and SO3. Minor linguistic improvements in the Polish Annexes I-III of Zavesca are made. Minor changes in the wording of section 4.4 of the SmPC were also implemented in order to improve clarity. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. Furthermore, the MAH used this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the QRD template version 7.3. The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC and Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications | 17/11/2011 | 22/12/2011 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | This variation concerns amendment of Product Information for Zavesca based on the results obtained from the two recently completed studies (OGT 918-011 and OGT 918- 018) and from the analysis of the updated pooled safety data. The results were submitted in fulfilment of specific obligations SO2 and SO3. Section 5.1 of the SmPC was amended to add information obtained from study OGT 918-011, which was an open- label, non comparative, 2-year study enrolled 42 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, who had received a minimum of 3 years of ERT and who fulfilled criteria of stable disease for at least 2 years. The patients were switched to monotherapy with miglustat 100 mg t.i.d. Liver volume (primary efficacy variable) was unchanged from baseline to the end of treatment. Six patients had miglustat treatment prematurely discontinued for potential disease worsening, as defined in the study. Twenty-one patients completed 24 months of miglustat treatment. Of these, 18 patients at baseline were within established therapeutic goals for liver and spleen volume, haemoglobin levels, and platelet |

In section 4.4 of the SmPC, information about the need to re-assess risk-benefit in patients who develop symptoms such as numbness and tingling is deleted and this is based on the results of studies OGT 918-011 and OGT 918-018. Section 4.8 and 4.7 were updated with information related tt adverse events and their frequency, as observed in the above studies.   |

| II/0028 | Update of sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Charecteristics (SPC), to reflect the wider clinical experience available since the marketing authorisation of miglustat. In addition the Package Leaflet was updated to reflect the new contact details of a number of local representatives. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 25/09/2008 | 28/10/2008 | SmPC and PL           | With this variation the MAH submitted the results of an extension of study OGT 918-004 and of a pooled analysis on the effect of miglustat on bone disease from three clinical trials (OGT 918-001, OGT 918-004, OGT 918-005). Furthermore, the MAH provided a discussion on the comparability between miglustat and intravenous enzyme replacement treatment (ERT) as well as on the severity assessment at baseline in patients treated with miglustat. Addition of descriptive data to section 5.1 was seen as adding value to the prescriber and was therefore recommended by the CHMP. Finally, the CHMP endorsed the changes to aspects of the wording covering on the comparison between miglustat and ERT and for experience in severely affected patients. |

The results from trial OGT 918-018 indicate that peripheral neuropathy may be more common in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease compared to the general population, and therefore section 4.4 of the SPC has been updated to reflect this information. A section concerning exposure and incidence across different patient groups has been included in section 4.8 of the SPC as well as reclassification of several adverse drug reactions. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.   |

| N/0012  | The approved EU packaging for Zavesca consists of: Four blisters, four calendar cards, four blister holders and one Package Leaflet are assembled together with an outer carton to form a booklet. The MAH has removed the calendar cards and blister holders from the packaging. The pictogram and the three steps for removal of the capsules have been transferred from the blister holders to section 3 of the Package Leaflet (\"How to take Zavesca). The text \"Morning, Afternoon, Evening\" in the calendar card has also been transferred to section 3 of the Package Leaflet, which now states, \"the usual dose is one capsule (100 mg) three times a day (morning, afternoon, evening)\". The calendar card text Day 1 - day 7 has been deleted. Additionally, the pictogram \"ZA\" in front of the invented name has been eliminated in a few places from the outer carton. | 23/09/2005 | n/a | Labelling and PL |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
