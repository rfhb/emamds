## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

The spectrum of diseases related to Candida species is wide, ranging from superficial candidiasis such as thrush to life threatening infections associated with an overall prognosis comparable with that of septic  shock.  Invasive  candidiasis  (also  known  as  systemic  or  deep-seated  candidosis)  refers  to infection of the visceral organs. It is a life-threatening infection, usually involving multiple organs, the Candida having  spread  via  the  bloodstream  to  organs  such  as  the  liver,  spleen  and  kidney ('disseminated  candidiasis').  Acute  disseminated  candidiasis  is  characterised  by  the  rapid  onset  of fever,  sometimes  shock,  and  other  signs  of  sepsis.  In  immunocompromised  patients,  a  presumptive diagnosis  may  be  made  based  on  multiple  positive  cultures  from  non-sterile  sites.  Because  cultureconfirmation  is  relatively  slow  compared  to  that  achieved  with  bacterial  infections,  and  may  be negative  even  in  the  presence  of  subsequent  proven  fungal  sepsis  antifungal  therapy  is  sometimes given on an empiric basis.

The  incidence  of  candidemia  has  been  increasing  due to  a  variety  of  factors,  including  iatrogenic immunosuppression, increasingly invasive technologies, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Invasive candidiasis accounted for 17% of hospital-acquired infections reported during the European Study  on  the  Prevalence  of  Nosocomial  Infections  in  Critically  Ill  patients  (EPIC),  which  included 10 038 patients from 1417 intensive care units (ICUs) in 17 countries in 1992. US data have shown that Candida species are the fourth most common cause of bloodstream infection, accounting for 8 to 15%  of  all  nosocomial  bloodstream infections. Incidence rate of invasive candidiasis varies considerably and has been estimated to affect 0.2- 1.0 in 10,000 persons per year.

Candida albicans is the commonest species associated with deep infection but other ('nonalbicans ') species of which Candida glabrata now dominates are becoming increasingly common.

Antifungal  medicinal  products  currently  recommended  for  the  treatment  of  invasive  candidiasis  are amphotericin B (lipid-based formulations), fluconazole or caspofungin. In each case, these are given as monotherapy.

Despite the availability of treatments, the mortality and morbidity due to invasive candidiasis is high (mortality  varying  between  4.5  and  49  %).  The  frequency  of  persistent  candidaemias  in  spite  of therapy  remains  10-17%,  while Candidaattributable  mortality  is  10-19%.  There  is  therefore  still  a need for new antifungal agents.

Mycograb (efungumab) has been developed as a new therapeutic approach. Efungumab is directed to heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) which plays a vital role in fungal cell survival. Efungumab is a singlechain Fv human monoclonal antibody fragment produced in E. coli by recombinant DNA technology where the variable domain of the heavy chain (VH) is connected to the variable domain of the light chain (VL) with a linker.

The applied indication was for the treatment of invasive candidiasis in adult patients, in combination with amphotericin B or a lipid formulation of amphotericin B.

The  proposed  dose  regimen  of  Mycograb  2mg/ml  powder  for  solution  for  injection  in  adults  was 1 mg/kg  body  weight  twice  a  day  (12 hours  apart)  for  5 days,  in  combination  with  amphotericin B therapy.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

The drug substance in Mycograb, efungumab (recombinant human monoclonal antibody to hsp90), is a human-derived single chain variable antibody fragment which binds to the yeast antigen heat shock protein hsp90 (rhMAB-hsp90). It is produced in Escherichia coli .

## Drug Substance

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rhMAB-hsp90  is  a  non-glycosylated  27 kDa  peptide,  which  contains  two  disulphide  bonds.  The protein  consists  of  the  variable  domains  of  heavy  (VH)  and  light  chains  (VL)  joined  via  a  flexible linker peptide. For the purposes of purification and detection, a hexahistidine tag has been introduced to the C-terminal end of the protein. The protein does not possess the Fc portion that is responsible for certain biological functions of an antibody.

## Manufacture

## Manufacturers

The  drug  substance  is  manufactured  by  a  contractor,  which  holds  a  valid  manufacturing  license. Following inspection of the site, compliance to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) was confirmed although  the  process  validation  reports  have  not  been  finalised  (missing  cleaning  validation,  which according to the applicant will be available beginning 2007).

## Genetic development

The description of generation of the production cell genetics is brief but in general acceptable. The rhMAB-hsp90 nucleotide sequence was re-synthesised incorporating codons optimal for expression in E.coli ,  without altering the primary amino acid sequence. The coding sequence was inserted into an over expression vector with an optimised sequence for correct expression. The nucleotide sequence of the optimised gene sequence was determined and shown to result in the correct coding sequence. At the carboxyl terminus of the expression construct, a vector-derived histidine tag is present to facilitate purification.  Otherwise,  the  predicted  amino  acid  sequence  of  the  rhMAB-hsp90  protein  from  the vector is exactly the same as that found in the parent rhMAB-hsp90 gene.

## Cell Banking

## Cell banks of an E.coli strain were manufactured using animal-free media.

For the preparation of the master cell bank (MCB) in-process controls included determination of OD600 and pH, as well as tests for microbial contamination. The MCB is stored under liquid nitrogen in the gas  phase.  The  working  cell  bank  (WCB)  is  used  to  directly  provide  cells  for  the  manufacturing process. For preparation of working cell banks the procedure was essentially the same as that used in construction of the MCB. Testing of the MCB and WCB are identical and adequate.

## Genetic stability

Post-production cell bank testing was performed on the first four production batches of rhMAB-hsp90 to establish the genetic stability and robustness of the fermentation process. Testing was performed on cells at the end point of fermentation. Analysis post-fermentation showed that the production cell line continues  to  produce  recombinant  protein  after  the  fermentation  process  and  that  the  nucleotide structure  of  the  coding  region  remains  unchanged.  Levels  of  plasmid  retention  also  remain  largely unaltered, further demonstrating genetic stability of the expression strain/construct.

Overall, acceptable information has been provided on genetics development, genetic stability and cell bank stability.

## Starting materials

Animal-derived materials used in manufacture of rhMAB-hsp90 are prepared from bovine milk and using bovine bile from cows in countries where cases of BSE have never occurred (Brazil and USA) and  where  fodder  is  not  prepared  from  the  meat.  Serum  is  not  used  in  the  composition  of  the  cell culture  medium,  including  WCB  cultivation  and  cell  culture  process  media.  Materials  used  in  the manufacture process are adequately controlled.

## Cell culture and purification

Efungumab is produced by fermentation in E.coli in the form of inclusion bodies, which are extracted from the cell mass and refolded. Subsequently, the protein is purified by three chromatographic steps under denaturing conditions including an anion exchange chromatography and an affinity chromatography which are used to remove any remaining protein contaminants and endotoxin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The pH of the resulting eluate is adjusted, concentrated by diafiltration (tangential flow filtration) and the denaturant is removed by buffer exchange to allow the protein to adopt its folded conformation. This is  a  critical  step.  Finally,  the  product  is  then  sterile  filtered  into  sterile  bags  and  kept  to  await preparation  of  the  finished  product.  The  material  that  is  loaded  onto  an  anion  exchange  column  is defined as a batch.

Overall, the manufacturing process has been well described. Establishment of controls for critical steps are described. In-process controls are in place during fermentation, harvest and purification and limits and  ranges  are  acceptable.  Factors  impacting  on  the  aggregate  size  distribution  have  not  been evaluated by the company.

Six consecutive manufactured production scale batches were evaluated to provide evidence that the manufacturing of drug substance is reproducible and leading to suitable product quality as defined in the drug substance specification. The  validation program  included:  demonstration  of process consistency,  transport  validation,  validation  of  critical  process  steps  (removal  of  process  related impurities, stability testing of drug substance and validation on reuse of columns and TFF filters) and a definition of acceptance criteria for the routine manufacturing process. Evaluation and control of the removal  of  impurities  were  extended  from  evaluation  of  HCP  and  endotoxin  content  to  include evaluation  of  DNA  and  other  process  related  impurities.  Some  scale-down  and  full-scale  data  have been presented.

All in-process controls met the specified IPC acceptance criteria and all six batches showed consistent results  and  met  the  drug  substance  specifications,  supporting  that  the  drug  substance manufacturing process is sufficiently controlled and operates in a consistent manner. However, control of aggregation was not part of the testing program for validation and therefore consistency with regard to aggregates has  not  been  demonstrated.  This  issue  is  connected  to  the  general  issue  raised  on  the  control  of aggregates (see below). Purity of the drug substance is solely evaluated as removal of process-related impurities and none of the in-process controls measures the correct refolding and purity of the protein during the manufacturing process.

Validation of the refolding step has not been performed/finalised. Instead an in-process control at the drug  substance  level  was  proposed  using  a  non-validated  method  and  circular  dichroism  (CD)  is proposed in the drug product specification. Since the in-process method was not validated and since the CD data provided have not been convincing, it cannot be concluded that the folding of the protein was properly controlled.

## Characterisation

rhMAB-hsp90 and  product  related  impurities  have  been  characterised  using  a  battery  of  analytical techniques. A high-molecular variant is seen in the SDS-PAGE gel. Measured by two different ELISA assays the antigen-binding activity of the high-molecular variant is shown to be significant and only slightly  lower  than  the  parent  molecule.  This  high-molecular  variant  is  therefore  considered  as  a product-related  substance.  By  the  introduction  of  a  new  SDS-gel  method  a  better  separation  of  the parent molecule and the high-molecular variant is achieved. The method is validated and considered acceptable  to  control  the  high-molecular  variant  in  the  drug  substance  and  the  drug  product  and  a release specification on the basis of this assay was proposed for drug substance and drug product.

The characterisation studies performed under native conditions revealed the presence of an unusually high level of protein aggregates. These aggregates were studied using size exclusion chromatography (SEC).  The  applicant  proposed  that  the  SEC  method  provides  information  on  the  consistency  of aggregation between batches. However, consistent results between batches could be shown.

The applicant also provided data using other methods. However, results did neither provide additional assurance of consistent molecular weight distribution between batches, nor explain the root cause for aggregation.

The  BWP  considered  that  the  control  of  aggregates  is  a  crucial  part  of  the  quality  control  of  this product but the company did not present data which in a convincing way assure that this parameter is well controlled.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  conclusion  the  lack  of  a  suitable  method  to  control  aggregation  in  the  drug  substance  was considered to be of major concern.

It  should  be  noted  that  during  development,  changes  have  been  introduced  to  the  manufacturing process such as a more than 2-fold increase in batch size (with replacement of a 10 L anion exchange column with a 20 L column). In general, using the available methods, comparability has been show throughout manufacturing development. However, with regard to aggregation no acceptable method is available  and  therefore  consistency  between  batches  has  not  been  demonstrated  with  regard  to aggregation.

## Specifications

Specifications were proposed on the basis of results from release testing of 10 cGMP manufacturing lots of rhMAB-hsp90. Lots 1-8 were used in pivotal clinical trials. Specifications include:

- protein concentration determined by spectrophotometric measurement at 280 nm
- activity/potency test by ELISA which measures the specific activity of the active substance
- pH
- purity by SDS-PAGE coomassie stained
- DNA measured following phenol extraction
- endotoxin measured by quantitative kinetic-QCL assay
- host cell protein determined by non-quantitative SDS-PAGE and Western Blot method
- high molecular variant by SDS PAGE
- degradation products by SDS PAGE densitometry
- High molecular weight aggregates using a SEC method
- sterility tested in accordance with Ph.Eur using the filtration method

As  indicated  above  (characterisation),  the  SDS-Page  method  is  acceptable  for  evaluation  of  the monomer-,  dimerand high molecular product-related variants. Neither the method  nor the specification to control the distribution of high molecular weight aggregates are acceptable.

One host cell protein is co-purifying together with the drug substance in significant amounts. The level is  considered  high  when  compared  to  other  parenteral  biological  medicinal  products.  The  data provided showed that while the proposed HCP assay may be suitable for the detection of a particular HCP and to confirm  the  level  of  this  particular  impurity,  it  is  not  suitable  for  the  detection  of  the overall levels of HCPs.

## Stability

Preliminary real-time (96 hours) stability data were presented together with data from storage under accelerated conditions. Under accelerated condition some out of specification results were seen. Under normal  storage  condition  results  remained  within  the  specification.  Therefore  the  proposed  storage conditions are considered acceptable. However the stability study does not include a suitable test for aggregate size distribution.

## Drug Product

The Mycograb product is a sterile, white lyophilised powder for solution for intravenous injection. The lyophilised powder is reconstituted with 5 ml water prior to injection. The water for injection is not  provided  with  Mycograb.  The  product  contains  10  mg  efungumab.  The  reconstituted  product contains 2 mg/ml active substance. The excipients are not of human or animal origin.

The product is presented in 5 ml clear, borosilicate glass Type 1 (Ph. Eur.) vials closed by bromobutyl rubber stoppers and aluminium flip caps.

## Pharmaceutical Development

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Development  of  the  lyophilised  formulation  of  drug  product  has  been  described  and  justified.  The reconstituted solution of Mycograb has a high pH. The high pH together with the excipients ensure solubility  and  prevent  precipitation  of  the  protein.  Should  the  pH  in  solution  drop  below  a  certain level, Mycograb precipitates yielding a turbid, white solution, which is unsuitable for therapeutic use. This raises question about protein solubility when the product is entering physiological conditions.

A FS method was developed to evaluate the impact of excipients on the secondary structure of the protein. However, the Applicant has not made a comparison between different batches analysed with this technique and consequently, the consistency of the structural characteristics of Mycograb has not been demonstrated.

A  CD  spectroscopy  method  was  proposed  to  confirm  the  proper  folding  of  the  protein  however, because of methodological deficiencies, this method is not considered suitable for control of correct refolding  of  the  protein.  The  issue  of  refolding  is  of  importance  since  it  is  likely  that  folding  may impact on the binding of the antibody to its antigen.

## Manufacture

The drug product is manufactured and tested prior to release by a contractor for which compliance to GMP was confirmed.

The manufacturing process for the finished product consists of 0.22 µ m sterile filtration, aseptic filling, lyophilisation, sealing and packaging. The manufacturing process and in-process controls have been adequately  described.  Critical  steps  have  been  defined  and  are  controlled.  The  process  has  been sufficiently validated.

As  for  the  drug  substance,  the  validation  of  the  drug  product  manufacturing  process  was  still  in progress during evaluation and the validation reports have not been finalised. Although preliminary validation results hint towards a consistent and acceptable controlled manufacturing process, the lack a finalised validation makes  it impossible to conclude on the adequacy  of the drug product manufacturing process. This is a major objection to a positive opinion for this product.

## Product specification

Finished product specifications based on the analysis of 10 production batches have been adequately justified and are acceptable. Batch analysis results confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is under control. Some of the tests and specifications for drug product are identical to those applied to drug substance. Tests specifically performed on the finished product are pH after reconstitution, detection of particles and subparticles after reconstitution, residual moisture after drying, endotoxin and sterility.

A specification was introduced to control the level of a E.coli protein impurity (present in the drug product.  This  protein  is  co-purified  with  Mycograb  and  present  at  a  high  level  for  a  parenteral medicinal product and which is not acceptable  The methods used for detection of total HCP and this E.coli protein give contradictory results and consequently, this specific E.coli protein is not adequately controlled. The product should not be used as long as this impurity is not adequately controlled.

## Stability

Results for up to 48 months under long term stability conditions at 2-8°C, accelerated conditions for up to 6 months at 25°C, heat stress stability for 24 hours at three elevated temperatures, wet stability (after reconstitution in water) and photostability conditions have been provided.

Long-term stability studies were carried out on 4 batches, accelerated studies were carried out on 3 batches, and stress stability, wet stability and photostability studies were carried out on 1 batch.

When stored at 2-8°C the product was found to remain within the proposed specifications over the 48-month testing period. The reconstituted product remained within the proposed specifications up to 48 hours.

However, as already mentioned for the stability  of  the  drug  substance,  the  stability  studies  lack  an acceptable  method  to  evaluate  the  aggregate  size  distribution  during  storage.  Therefore,  no  firm conclusion can be drawn on the stability of Mycograb.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adventitious agents

Information  on  control  of  mycoplasma,  bacteria  and  fungi,  testing  of  source  materials  and  testing during manufacturing were provided.

The MCB and WCBs, which have been established, are free from TSE-risk substances. Two materials of animal origin are used during drug substance production. Compliance with the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Human and Veterinary  Medicinal  Products  (EMEA/410/01  Rev.  2)  has  been  demonstrated.'  The  risk  of  TSE transmission is considered negligible.

Viral  validation  studies  have  not  been  performed  and  this  is  considered  acceptable  since  viral contamination  is  unlikely.  Human  or  animal  cell  lines  are  not  used  in  manufacture.  The  protein  is expressed in E.coli and the fermentation process occurs in a serum-free medium. The risk of potential contamination with adventitious agents is considered minimal.

In summary, the virus safety of the product has been sufficiently demonstrated.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Mycograb is clearly not a conventional monoclonal antibody product and the active substance has a tendency to aggregation. The size of the aggregates has been intensively investigated by the company using several methods. Neither of these methods, however, has provided satisfactory information with respect to the aggregates.

The company have attempted to find suitable methods to control the size distribution of aggregates and proposed SEC for release testing. However, because of methodological deficiencies, the proposed method is not considered adequate for control of aggregation and to demonstrate consistency of the manufacturing process and stability. The control of aggregation is a crucial parameter for the quality control  of  this  product  and  the  company  has  not  been  able  to  demonstrate  that  the  manufacturing process produces a product with consistent aggregation.

In  addition,  validation  of  the  refolding  step  has  not  been  performed  appropriately  and  finalised. Instead,  an  in-process  control  at  the  drug  substance  level  is  introduced  and  CD  is  proposed  for  the drug product specifications. So far the CD data provided have not been convincing and the method is not  considered  suitable  for  controlling  refolding  of  this  product.  As  no  validation  data  have  been presented for the in-process method, it cannot be concluded that the applicant has demonstrated that the refolding step of the protein is adequately controlled.

For the determination of E. coli host cell protein (HCP) in the drug substance the company has used a commercial ELISA assay. Validation data for the assay have been presented. The level of HCP present in the final product is high when compared to other parental preparations. Such a high level can have an impact on the safety (immunogenicity), which has to be considered with respect to use in patients (repetitive administration) and results from clinical trials.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

The  discovery  of  efungumab  stemmed  from  the  observation  that  patients  with  invasive  candidiasis treated with amphotericin B were more likely to recover from the infection if they produced antibody to  the  hsp90  antigen.  Therefore,  the  non-clinical  testing  strategy  was  designed  to  determine  the protective potential, safety and optimal dosage of Mycograb in combination with amphotericin B in the treatment of invasive candidiasis.

All pivotal non-clinical studies were claimed to be conducted in accordance with principles of Good Laboratory Practices (GLP).

## Pharmacology

## · Primary pharmacodynamics

Efungumab  is  a  human  recombinant  monoclonal  antibody.  It  belongs  to  a  new  class  of  antifungal agents which target the immunodominant epitope of Candida hsp90.

Its mode of action involves binding to and inactivation of hsp90 present in the fungal cell wall and in extracellular material, particularly around foci of infection. Hsp90 has been suggested playing a key role in cell wall formation and repair, involving the chaperone-mediated folding of cell wall kinases. Inhibition of this process by efungumab would lead to a weakened cell wall. This explains the synergy seen  with  antifungals  active  at  sites  such  as  the  cell  membrane  (amphotericin  B)  or  cell  wall (caspofungin).

For binding to the epitope presented as a synthetic peptide, the Ka value was 2.3 x 10 4 M -1 s -1 and the Kd value was 6.47 x10 -4 s -1 ,  showing a high affinity and a very slow rate of dissociation, i.e. once binding is established dissociation has a half-life measured in days rather than hours. The equilibrium dissociation  constant  (KD;  Kd/Ka)  was  2.9  x  10 -8 M.  The  dissociation  constant  for  efungumab  and Candida hsp90 (as a recombinant protein) was 7.2 x 10 -7 M. At body temperature (37 ° C), there was an increase  in  the  association  rate  constant  between  efungumab  and  the  peptide  epitope,  but  the dissociation rate constant remained low, consistent with a half-life of several days.

In  vitro, efungumab  alone  has  modest  antifungal  activity  with  the  MIC-0s  ranging  from  128  to 512 µg/ml.  It showed synergistic effect with amphotericin B for a wide range of species of Candida . In  in-vitro  killing  assay  of  a  clinical  relevant  panel  of Candida strains,  there  was  no  antagonism between efungumab and amphotericin B. All isolates tested produced either synergy or an additive effect,  i.e.  more  than  10-fold  decrease  in  counts  in  the  presence  of  both  agents  compared  to  either compound alone. Efficacy concentrations were clinically appropriate.

In-vivo activity was confirmed in a non-lethal mouse model based on either the production of sterile biopsies  or  a  reduction  in  colony  forming  units  in  the  liver,  spleen  and  kidney  at  48  hours  after treatment with efungumab alone (2 mg/kg) or in combination with amphotericin B (0.6 mg/kg). In a murine model, efungumab alone produced a statistically significant improvement in infections caused by a series of clinically relevant Candida strains  [ albicans (strain  7),  fluconazole-resistant albicans , fluconazole-resistant krusei (FA/157), tropicalis (NCPF 3242), parapsilosis (NCPF 3104), lusitaniae , and glabrata (NCPF 3240)]. Amphotericin B alone cleared the Candida tropicalis infection but failed to fully clear infections caused by albicans , krusei , glabrata or parapsilosis strains.  When co-administered,  efungumab  and  amphotericin  B  completely  resolved  infections  with Candida albicans , krusei and glabrata . However, no advantage of combination was observed for C.  parapsilosis NCPF  3104  and C.  parapsilosis (clinical  isolate).  Taken  together,  these  findings support the clinical use of efungumab.

When used in combination with caspofungin, synergy was claimed in mice infected with the outbreak strain  of C.  albicans (spleen  at  4mg/kg  caspofungin),  a  fluconazole-resistant  strain  of C.  albicans

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(liver at 1mg/kg), C. krusei (liver at 1mg/kg), C. tropicalis (kidney at 4mg/kg), C. glabrata (all organs at 4mg/kg) and C. guilliermondii (spleen at 4mg/kg). However there are currently no clinical data to support the use of the efungumab in combination with caspofungin.

Synergy,  or  an  additive  effect,  was  demonstrated  between  efungumab  and  amphotericin  B  for 9 isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans .

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

The  applicant  claimed  that  assessment  of  complement  binding  and  cytotoxicity  are  not  relevant  to efungumab since it  does  not  possess  an  Fc  fragment,  which  is  the  component  of  a  whole  antibody mediating complement binding and cytotoxicity.

Since efungumab recognises a conserved epitope (LKVIRK) present in both human and yeast hsp90, it would be expected to recognise both human and Candida hsp90. However human hsp90 thought to be essentially  cytosolic.  The  hypothesis  of  the  applicant  is  that,  in  normal  conditions,  hsp90  is  not accessible to efungumab in vivo . Human hsp90 is only found on the cell surface in disease states such as breast cancer. Induction of antibodies to hsp90, as occurs naturally in patients who recover from invasive Candida infections,  is  not  associated  with  autoimmune  phenomena.  It  remains  unclear  as whether efungumab can bind to normal cells in healthy individuals or individuals with fungal sepsis.

An immunohistochemical investigation into the cross-reactivity of efungumab with human tissues was conducted  according  to  acceptable  standards.  These  studies  demonstrated  intracellular  staining consistent  with  the  distribution  of  endogenous  hsp90  in  human  tissues.  However,  in  vitro  studies suggest  that  cells  may  express  hsp90  on  their  surface  in  certain  conditions,  such  as  malignant transformation.

In vitro, there was no evidence that Mycograb was an inducer of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 isoenzymes. Also it  did  not  induce  any  cytotoxicity  (LDH  release  and  decrease  in  ATP  levels)  or  apoptosis  (as measured by Caspase 3/7 activity) when tested up to its limit of solubility (100 µ g/ml).  Cytotoxicity was seen at highly precipitating concentration ranges (316-1000 µg/ml).

## · Safety pharmacology programme

Cardiovascular  and  respiratory  safety  parameters  were  investigated  in  a  predictive  animal  model administered single dosages of 1, 10 or 20 mg/kg by IV infusion over approximately 15 min. A minor increase  in  arterial  blood  pressure  was  observed  in  2  out  of  4  animals  30-45  minutes  after administration of the 10-mg/kg efungumab. At 20 mg/kg, a significant increase in heart rate and blood pressure, accompanied by a decrease in femoral artery blood flow occurred. These effects, also seen in clinical trials, were likely associated with an increase in femoral artery resistance. efungumab did not affect any of the respiratory parameters.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No specific studies have performed besides the above-mentioned studies.

## Pharmacokinetics

Initially  the  pharmacokinetics  had  not  been  appropriately  assessed  (data  pooled  from  a  single  dose using female animals only, using assays which were not considered validated).

To  address  this  objection,  the  applicant  provided  further  data  to  characterise  the  pharmacokinetics profile  of  efungumab  from  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  in  mice  and  in  monkeys  and  a  safety pharmacology study in dogs using validated ELISA method.

CD-1 mice of both sexes were dosed for 14-15 days via bolus injection twice daily with dose levels of 0, 2, or 10 mg/kg/day.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results  displayed  in  below  table  showed  that  systemic  exposure  to  efungumab  increased  as  dose increased from 2 to 10 mg/kg twice daily. There was evidence of a decrease in systemic exposure to Mycograb between Day 1 and Day 15 of dosing, which could indicate adaptive changes in the kinetics of  Mycograb,  such  as  antibody  formation  to  the  antibody  fragment,  following  repeat  twice  daily dosing for 14 days.

The impact of antibody formation to the antibody fragment on the toxicokinetics parameters is not fully analysed, therefore the kinetics values should be used with caution.

The toxicokinetics parameters obtained from the repeat dose toxicity study performed in monkeys are displayed in the following tables.

The  small  sample  size  precludes  from  any  firm  conclusion  on  the  possible  difference  between  the genders.

There were no animal studies on the metabolism.  This is acceptable in view of the biological nature of the product and is in line with the Guideline ICH S6.

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

There was no single-dose toxicity study conducted which is acceptable in view of the biological nature of the product.

- Repeat dose toxicity

The applicant presented initially only the results of a 7-day repeat-dose toxicity study conducted in groups of 5 mice given enfugumab twice daily IV (bolus) doses of 0 (control), 2 (low) or 10 (high) mg/kg  with  a  21  days  observation  period.  This  study  was  not  designed  to  be  compliant  with  any particular  regulatory  guidelines  but  is  in  line  with  the  proposals  for  toxicity  studies  for  anti-cancer antibodies  as  outlined  in  the  NIBSC/CRC  and  MCA  guidelines.  High-dose  mice  showed  hunched posture, subdued behaviour, piloerection and rolling gait. Clinical chemistry data were not assessable due  to  insufficient  control  data.  Spleen  weights  were  increased  in  male  mice  without  obvious histological changes. However, extramedullary haematopoiesis at the high-dose level was marginally greater  in  both  sexes  as  compared  to  controls.  Haematology  was  not  affected.  As  the  only  other finding  in  this  study,  treatment-related  lymphoid  hyperplasia  was  observed  in  the  2  and  10  mg/kg groups.  Since  there  was  a  strong  immunogenic  response  to  the  humanised  antibody,  this  may  well have caused the latter findings. Toxicokinetics and interspecies comparisons were not accounted for.

To address the serious omissions in the repeat dose study in CD-1 mice, the applicant conducted a 2 nd study. In a 14-day repeated dose toxicity study, groups of CD-1 mice were given IV dose levels of 0, 2,  or  10  mg/kg  bid.  Local  irritation  was  observed  at  the  tail  site  of  injection.  Spleen  weights  were statistically  significant  higher  in  treated  mice,  and  dose-related  increases  in  the  number of germinal centres  (in  the  white  pulp),  clusters  of  plasma  cells  and  extent  of  haemopoiesis  were  observed compared with controls. A few high-dose mice had minor hyperplasia of the bone marrow. Effects on the spleen were considered secondary to an immune response to efungumab. Unexplained mortality occurred  in  two  mice  in  the  high  dose  group  (10  mg/kg  bid).  The  NOAEL  was  considered  to  be 2 mg/kg bid, and on a dose-to-dose basis the safety margin to proposed human exposure (1 mg/kg bid) is 2. Qualitative assessment of PAS-stained sections of testes, taking into account the tubular stages of the spermatogenic cycle, did not reveal any treatment related effects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Considering the immunogenic response to efungumab in mice, a second repeat dose toxicity study was thus performed in Cynomologus monkeys. Escalating doses of efungumab from 5 to 10  mg/kg/day  administered  intravenously  (over  4  days)  followed  by  20  mg/kg/day  (divided  in  two administrations /12hrs) for 14 days, resulted only in a low level of antibody response. This was higher than the mean levels observed in the patients treated with efungumab but much lower than the levels observed  in  mice.  This  antibody  response  was  insufficient  to  reduce  the  levels  of  circulating efungumab in the monkeys, which was in contrast to the situation seen during toxicokinetic analysis of the mice sera. Two of the four monkeys monitored to day 33 had produced a more marked antibody response (predominantly IgM) by day 33, which began to match the levels seen in the mice. There were no mortalities, adverse clinical signs or effects on body weight, or clinical pathology. Two of the treated  monkeys  had  enlarged  spleens  compared  to  controls  and  other  treated  monkeys,  but  this correlated  poorly  with  antibody  titre  and  was  not  associated  with  histopathological  findings.  There was  no  evidence  of  local  irritation  due  to  the  injections.  There  was  no  evidence  of  organ  related toxicity at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day of efungumab.

## · Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity

Genotoxicity  and  carcinogenicity  studies  were  not  performed  which  is  considered  acceptable considering  the  nature  of  the  compound  (human  recombinant  antibody)  and  the  intended  clinical duration of treatment (5 days).

## · Reproduction Toxicity

Fertility and pre- and post-natal development studies were not performed.

Toxicity to embryo-foetal development was investigated in groups of 30 pregnant CD-1 mice given efungumab  0,  2  or  10  mg  /kg  twice  daily  by  IV  administration.  The  maximum  dose  (10  mg/kg) represented 10x the human therapeutic dose and was the same as in a repeat-dose toxicity study in the same species There were five unexplained deaths in the high dose group. All unscheduled mortalities had enlarged spleens. Local tolerance at site of application was poor as dose-related sores and lesions on  the  tail  were  observed.  Nonetheless  because  most  of  the  high  dose  mice  found  dead  were cannibalised, determination of the cause of death was difficult and the clinical relevance is therefore unknown.

With respect  to  treatment-related  malformations,  cleft  palate  was  observed  in  one  2-mg/kg  litter  (1 foetus) and in two 10 mg/kg litters (3 foetuses); exencephaly was observed in one foetus in each of the 2 and 10 mg/kg dose groups. The observed dose-related incidences of these 2 specific malformations were higher than historical data for the same strain and testing facility. These findings suggest that efungumab may be teratogenic in CD-1 mice, possibly due to the role of the molecular chaperone, hsp90,  in  foetal  development.  There  was  a  concern  over  the  species  used  since  the  mice  had  a significant  immunogenic  response  to  efungumab  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  at  identical  dose levels.

## · Local tolerance

Specific  local  tolerance  studies  were  not  conducted.  Local  tolerance  of  Mycograb  was  poor  in  the embryo-foetal toxicity study where the majority of clinical observations and necropsy findings were related  to  the  route  of  administration  i.e.  sores  and  lesions  of  the  tail  and  were  dose  related  in frequency and severity

Mixing  blood  and  Mycograb  at  relevant  concentration  did  not  produce  haemolysis,  and  therefore compatibility with blood was shown.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Other toxicity studies

Data  suggest  that  the  likelihood  of  significant  autoimmune  complications  is  low  in  spite  of  the autologous nature of the antigen.

Dependence, metabolite and impurity studies were not performed which was considered acceptable considering the nature of the product.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An assessment of the risk was performed and no significant risk to the environment related to the use of Mycograb is anticipated.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The clinical programme consisted of:

- an initial safety and tolerance study performed initially using 0.1 mg/kg and escalating to one and two doses of 1mg/kg/day of Mycograb given i.v. (NTB/Mycograb/001).
- A  pilot  and  confirmatory  double-blind  placebo-controlled  studies  of  efficacy  and  safety  of 1  mg/kg  Mycograb  administered  iv  twice  daily  over  5  days  in  the  target  population (NTB/Mycograb/002).

The  applicant  subsequently  provided  results  from  2  new  pharmacokinetics  studies  (one  in  human volunteers  and  one  in  patients  with  advanced  carcinoma  of  the  breast)  to  further  characterise  the pharmacokinetics profile of Mycograb.

The applicant claimed that clinical trials were performed in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP). A GCP inspection was conducted at 2 sites in the Czech Republic, from which a substantial number of patients were recruited for the confirmatory study 002.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

Initially  the  clinical  pharmacokinetics  of  Mycograb  was  scarcely  studied  in  adult  patients  with confirmed  systemic Candida infections  already  receiving  liposomal  amphotericin  B.    Data  derived mainly from NTB/Mycograb/001, an initial safety and tolerance study performed in 5 patients initially using 0.1 mg/kg and escalating to one and two doses of 1mg/kg i.v. Mycograb daily.

Two different analytical methods were used to assay efungumab levels in patients, a gel system assay, which was later abandoned, and an ELISA assay respectively. From this 001 study, it appeared that the clearance of the antibody was rapid after the first injection. The concentrations tended to be higher in patients after the second dose; AUC (1-12h) on day 5 was 17.9 + 18.7 µg.h/ml versus 10.6 + 4.9 µg.h/ml  on  day  1.  It  remains  unclear  whether  this  was  due  to  accumulation  or  to  less  efficient clearance (less binding to target antigens), or perhaps to a technical artefact (antigen interference in the assay). These initial data cannot be regarded reliable considering the major technical problems with the efungumab-assay.

Two new PK studies were initiated to further characterise the pharmacokinetics profile. These studies involved a limited number of individuals. Considering the inter-individual variation, the data are not robust:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  A  single  and  repeat  dose,  open-label,  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  parallel  group  study  to investigate  the  pharmacokinetics,  safety  and  tolerability  of  Mycograb  in  healthy  male  and  female volunteers: (NTP/Mycograb/HuPK/001).

-  A  Phase  1b,  pharmacokinetic,  multicentre,  open  label  study  evaluating  the  safety  and  efficacy  of Mycograb  administered  IV  in  combination  with  docetaxel  in  metastatic  or  recurrent  breast  cancer patients (NTP/ONC/001).

## · Absorption

After  intravenous  administration,  Mycograb  is  rapidly  distributed  into  tissues  and  cleared  from  the circulation. In healthy volunteers (n = 5) given a single dose of 1 mg/kg Mycograb as an intravenous bolus over 10 minutes, the t1/2 was 0.8 ± 1.2 hours (range 0.2 - 2.9 hours), the Cmax was 2683 ± 318 ng/ml (range 2334 - 3046 ng/ml) and the AUC0-tz was 1336 ± 751 ng.h/ml. The clearance was 13.1 ± 5.6 ml/minute/kg and the volume of distribution was Vz 0.54 ± 0.33 and Vss 0.47 ± 0.22 l/kg.

After  single-dose  administration  to  healthy  subjects  over  the  range  0.25  to  1  mg/kg  infused  over 10 minutes, serum Mycograb concentrations quickly declined with time postdose at 0.25 mg/kg but were quantifiable generally for 1 to 4 hours postdose after 0.5 and 1 mg/kg. The peak concentration at the end of the infusion approximately doubled from 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg but then appeared to plateau at 1  mg/kg.  Following  administration  of  the  recommended  clinical  dose  of  1mg/kg  maximum  plasma concentrations  of  about  2700  ng/ml  was  reached.  Volume  of  distribution  was  about  0.5  l/kg  and clearance 13 ml/min/kg. Elimination half-life was about 0.8 hours .

Sparse blood sampling during the drug elimination phase was performed in breast cancer patients after a  single  dose  of  2  mg/kg  Mycograb  infused  over  30  or  60  minutes.  Half-lives  were  derivable  in 5  patients  averaging  1.4  ±  0.4  hours  (range,  1.1  to  2.0).  These  values  are  in  the  range  measured  in healthy subjects.

In  healthy  volunteers  (n  =  5,  2  withdrawn)  given  multiple  doses  of  0.5  mg/kg  Mycograb  as  an intravenous bolus over 10 minutes twice daily for 9 doses over 5 days, the t1/2 was 0.3 ± 0.1 hours (range 0.2 - 0.4 hours), the Cmax was 1188 ± 190 ng/ml (range 1016 - 1394 ng/ml) and the AUC0-tz was 590 ± 156 ng.h/ml. The clearance was 15.0 ± 4.4 ml/minute/kg and the volume of distribution was Vz 0.33 ± 0.05 and Vss 0.35 ± 0.05 l/kg.

## · Distribution

The nature  of  the  Mycograb-binding  to  plasma  proteins  remains  poorly  characterised.  Mycograb  is highly bound to plasma proteins and several purified serum proteins interfered in the Mycograb-assay, including human serum albumin and gamma globulin. The implications of these interactions may not be restricted to Mycograb assays but may have implications to distribution and elimination as well as to safety.

## · Elimination

With respect to metabolism, Mycograb is expected to be degraded into small peptides and individual amino acids. Methodological problems prevented from studying the urinary excretion of Mycograb. Nevertheless,  traces  of  monomer  and  dimer  sized  fragment  were  detected  in  urine  of  healthy volunteers. It was suggested that Mycograb is eliminated through renal filtration followed by tubular re-absorption  and  subsequent  metabolic  catabolism.  However,  it  is  also  possible  that  Mycograb  is present larger aggregates in plasma and will not pass the glomerular barrier.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

There are no specific studies on dose proportionality. Following repeated dosage, some accumulation with respect to Cmax is apparent, but the dataset is limited to draw firm conclusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A rather large degree of inter-subject PK variability has been shown (AUC steady-state CV% about 100 in the target population and about 40 in healthy volunteers). Data from intra-subject variability are too scarce to draw firm conclusion.

With respect to time-dependency kinetics, repeat dose study in healthy volunteers demonstrated that there was rather an increase than a reduction in Mycograb levels on day 2 when compared to day 1. This is in contrast with results reported for the pilot study in patients in which both Cmax  and AUC were reduced from day 1 and day 5.

Different assays were used in the study of healthy volunteers, on one hand and fungal sepsis patients, on the other hand. The large inter-individual variation and small number of observations hamper the interpretation of the results.

## · Special populations

The PK of Mycograb was not specifically studied in subject with renal impairment. Post-hoc analysis stratified according to renal function did not suggest a clinically relevant association, and therefore no dose-adjustment is necessary. Similarly post-hoc analysis stratified by gender and age did not reveal any influence requiring dose adjustment.

There are no data on the pharmacokinetic of efungumab in patients with hepatic impairment nor in data in children.

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

No specific interaction studies were performed . Considering that in vitro Mycograb was not an inducer of  CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 isoenzymes, the potential for pharmacokinetics interaction involving these isoenzymes is unlikely.

## Pharmacodynamics

No clinical pharmacodynamic studies were performed. Mycograb is suggested to play a key role in neutralising hsp90 which has entered the extracellular compartment. Hsp90 is intracellular in normal human cells, in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and it is not released as part of cell apoptosis. However, it is  released  as  a  consequence  of  cell  necrosis,  as  occurs  when  tissues  are  damaged  or  diseased. Therefore extracellular hsp90 is associated with disease states. Once in the extracellular compartment, hsp90 can interact with interleukin 6 and nitric oxide synthase. Published data show that interleukin 6 is  one  of  the  cytokines  released  from  monocytes  when  stimulated  by  amphotericin  B  and  has  been identified  as  a  major  systemic  regulator  of  C  reactive  protein  during  the  acute  phase  of  sepsis.  The administration of amphotericin B in fungal sepsis is often associated with pyrexia and chills. However, there are no pharmacodynamic studies in humans to support the suggested mechanism of action.

## Clinical efficacy

The  clinical  programme  consisted  of  two  multicentre  trials  involving  a  total  of  133  patients  to demonstrate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Mycograb  in  patients  with  invasive  candidiasis:    Study  002 Pilot and 002 Confirmatory (table 1). Originally, only a single trial with interim analysis was planned. This was then changed to present the data from two stages with a hypothesis generating pilot study from which sample size would be calculated for the subsequent confirmatory study.

## · Dose response studies

No  conventional  dose-response  studies  were  performed.  The  dose  of  1  mg/kg  which  was  selected based  on  extrapolation  from  animal  studies  and  AUC  and  Cmax  exposure  findings  in  the  phase 1 studies was considered acceptable.

The proposed duration of therapy of 5 days was supported by the clinical trial results. Prolongation beyond 10 doses was not allowed under the protocol. In order to further characterise the duration of therapy a surrogate marker of infection (level of pro-inflammatory interleukin-6) was measured in a post hoc analysis of sera from patients in the 002 Confirmatory Study. Although the IL-6 data were small and insufficient to provide any clear guide as to whether prolongation or dosage increase could be beneficial, there were to some extent supportive of the 5 days duration chosen. There are currently insufficient data to determine whether prolongation of therapy beyond 5 days could be beneficial.

## · Main studies

## Study 002 Pilot

The objectives of the study were:

- -to obtain preliminary data on the efficacy and safety of a 5 day course of Mycograb (1 mg/kg iv)  plus  liposomal  amphotericin  B  compared  to  placebo  plus  liposomal  amphotericin  B,  in adult, hospitalised patients with deep-seated candidosis;
- -to obtain further information on the pharmacokinetics, based on multiple time-points sampling;
- -to use these data to optimise the design of the final, confirmatory phase of the trial, particularly with  respect  to  sample  size,  treatment  regimen,  selection  of  endpoints  and  generation  of  the hypothesis to be tested.

This study included adult, hospitalised patients with culture-confirmed invasive candidiasis, randomised in seven centres from 3 countries (Belgium, Czech Republic and the UK). Multiple timepoints sampling was used with blood samples being taken at 0.5, 1, 4 and 12h post administration on each  of  Days  1-5,  as  well  as  urine  samples  being  collected.  Clinical  evaluation/disease  assessment visits  were  performed  twice  a  day  on  days  1-5.  Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  similar  to  the following Confirmatory study 002 (see below).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Central  randomisation  to  treatment  was  stratified  according  to  the  germ  tube  test  of  the  Candida isolated, since Candida albicans (germ tube positive) has been associated with a worse prognosis than non-albicans (germ tube negative species).

The test group received a 5 days course of Mycograb (1 mg/kg body weight, every 12h) given as a slow  intravenous  bolus  (over  5-10  minutes).  The  control  group  received  a  5  days  course  of  0.9% sodium  chloride  (for  intravenous  use)  every  12h,  given  as  a  slow  intravenous  bolus  (over  5-10 minutes).  The  volume  equated  to  that  which  would  have  been  given  if  the  patient  had  received Mycograb.  The  study  treatment  (Mycograb  or  saline)  was  started  within  12h  of  the  3rd  dose  of amphotericin B, and given after completion of the amphotericin B infusion.

All patients (both groups) received a 10 days course of a lipid formulation of amphotericin B -as an intravenous infusion. In this study investigators were  allowed  to choose  between  two  lipid preparations of either amphotericin B lipid complex  (5 mg/kg body weight daily) or amphotericin B liposome for injection (3 mg/kg body weight daily).

Efficacy  measure was similar as the ones described in study 002 Confirmatory i.e overall response (clinical and mycological, with the clinical response being regarded as favourable if there were clinical improvement or cure) to treatment (see under study 002 Confirmatory for further details). In the pilot study, a reduction in amphotericin B requirements was also considered as a marker of efficacy, having excluded  patients  who  were  withdrawn  prematurely  due  to  toxicity.  This  measure  of  efficacy  was discontinued in the subsequent confirmatory study.

There was no formal statistical analysis plan, patient numbers being too small for statistical analysis. The Mycograb-treated group was compared to the placebo-treated group with respect to efficacy and tolerance.  Comparison  of  the  two  groups  included  the  investigator`s  assessment  of  the  patient`s clinical  response  to  treatment  and  culture-confirmed resolution of the infection, combined to give a composite overall response to treatment by Day 10.

## RESULTS

## Patient disposition

Twenty-one patients were randomised, one patient withdrew before receiving the study medication. Eleven patients received Mycograb and nine patients placebo.

Out of the 11 patients who received Mycograb, 8 completed the study. The reasons for withdrawal were: death (1 due to a cardiac arrest in a patient with a recent myocardial infarction and two previous episodes  of  cardiac  asystole  before  study  entry,  and  1  due  to  patient's  deteriorating  irremediable multiorgan failure due to widespread atheromatosis, secondary to hypercholestrolaemia and hypertension) and withdrawal following complete clinical response and cultures repeatedly negative. The two deaths in the Mycograb group occurred soon after study entry.

In the placebo group, there was one premature termination due to the patient`s failure to respond, and his death 24h later due to multiple organ failure secondary to an aortic graft infected with Candida .

Five patients in the Mycograb group and six patients in the placebo group were infected with Candida albicans . One patient in each group had a mixed infection. Thus, three patients in the analysis group had other Candida strains.

None of the patients had immunosuppression or neutropenia.

As displayed in table 3, data were re-analysed using the more stringent definition of overall response as  subsequently  used  in  the  confirmatory  study,  in  which  patients  had  to  have  shown  a complete clinical  response  to  be  regarded  as  favourable  i.e  absence  of  pre-clinical  symptoms  and  signs  of invasive Candidiasis (one patient excluded from this analysis because the last positive culture was 6 days before study entry).

A summary of clinical response, categorised into complete, improvement and failure, over time during the study period (table 4) shows that at each time-point, the percentage of patients showing a complete clinical response was higher in the Mycograb-treated group than the placebo group. On Day 5, in the Mycograb-treated  group,  3  patients  had  made  a  complete  response  (compared  to  0  in  the  placebo group) and 1 failed (compared to 4 in the placebo group).

Having excluded patients who died while on amphotericin B, or were withdrawn prematurely due to toxicity, the average duration of amphotericin B therapy in the placebo group was 18 days (range 640) with a median of 13 days, while the average duration in the Mycograb group was 13 days (range 2-29) with a median of 9 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study 002 Confirmatory

## METHODS

## Study Participants

The  study  included  hospitalised  male  and  female  patients  of  18  years  or  older  with  presumed disseminated candidiasis based on: Clinical evidence of active infection (e.g. hyperthermia [&gt;38°C], hypothermia [&lt;36°C], tachycardia [&gt;110/min], hypotension [mean blood pressure &lt;70 mmHg], high white  cell  count  [&gt;11000/mm 3 ],  left  shift,  need  for  vasopressor  agents  or  other  abnormalities consistent with an ongoing infectious disease process).

-Plus documented growth of a Candida species, within 3 days prior to initiation of study treatment from:

- a blood culture
- and/or a urine culture, in the absence of an indwelling urinary
- and/or a culture of a specimen from a normally sterile body cavity or tissue
- catheter
- and/or multiple  positive  cultures  from  non  sterile  sites  in  a  immunocompromised  pyrexial patient  who  is  not  responding  to  broad-spectrum  antibiotic  therapy  and  is  evidently  not infected with any other recognisable pathogen.

Patients being treated with a systemic antifungal medicinal product other than amphotericin B lipid complex or amphotericin B liposome for injection were excluded, and the study treatment had to be started within 12h of the third dose of amphotericin B. Patients with candidal endocarditis were also excluded.

## Treatments

All  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  received  at  least  a  10  days  course  of  intravenous  lipid formulation  of  amphotericin  B  (amphotericin  B  lipid  complex,  5  mg/kg  body  weight  daily  or amphotericin  B  liposome  for  injection,  3  mg/kg  body  weight  daily)  combined  with  Mycograb  or placebo on the first  5  days.  After  the  10  days  period,  the  investigators  were  able  to  either  stop  the antifungal  medication,  to  continue  with  amphotericin  B  formulation  or  to  switch  to  alternative antifungal therapy, when clinically indicated.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of Mycograb (1 mg/kg iv bid) plus lipid formulation of amphotericin B versus placebo plus lipid formulation of amphotericin B in treatment of deep-seated Candida infections.  In  addition,  the  study  was  designed  to  obtain  information  on  the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of Mycograb.

There was a Safety Monitoring Committee for rapid assessment of any serious or unexpected adverse event which may be treatment related.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  overall  response  (clinical  and  mycological)  to  treatment, comparing the test with the control arm at Day 10. This was a composite endpoint comprising both the investigator's evaluation of the clinical response to treatment and culture-confirmed clearance of the infection on Day 10.

A favourable overall response was defined as:

- resolution of pre-treatment signs and symptoms of candidosis

·  and  culture-confirmed  eradication  of  Candida  from  clinically  significant  sites  (or  presumptive eradication, based on clinical recovery, if repeat sampling inappropriate).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Only patients with a complete clinical response were classified as a success - clinical improvement was considered as a failure.

Failure was defined as:

- lack of change or worsening in pre-treatment signs and symptoms of candidosis
- and/or culture-confirmed persistence of Candida from clinically significant sites.

Secondary efficacy included:

- Clinical response at Day 10
- Mycological response at Day 10 and time taken for cultures to clear
- Candida-attributable mortality and overall mortality (there had to be ongoing signs of sepsis at the time of death to support the investigator's decision that it was a Candida-attributable mortality).

## Sample size

The sample size was initially calculated from the unadjusted data (i.e patients required showing both a mycological and clinical response, but the clinical response being either partial or complete) of the pilot study. It was recalculated using adjusted data after applying a more stringent definition of clinical response, in which patients showing partial responses (improvement) were considered as failures.

## Randomisation

Central randomisation to treatment (1:1) was stratified according to the germ tube test of the Candida isolated, since Candida albicans (germ tube positive) has been associated with a worse prognosis than non-albicans (germ tube negative species).

## Blinding (masking)

The investigator and all personnel associated with the study and the patient were blinded to the study medication assignment (Mycograb or placebo) throughout the study.

## Statistical methods

The study had a superiority design. The main analysis of efficacy was based on the modified intent-totreat  (MITT)  population  that  included  all  randomised  subjects  who  had  a  clinical  or  mycological assessment 24 hours after starting study treatment with the exception of patients:

- o who do not have culture confirmation of disseminated candidiasis within 5 days of starting study treatment
- o whose only positive culture for candida is grown from respiratory secretions or throat sites (unless they have a tracheo-oesophageal fistula)
- o who do not have clinical or laboratory evidence of on-going sepsis (unless they are immunosuppressed)
- o who are found to have candidal endocarditis, characterised by cardiac vegetations and peripheral emboli.

Logistic  regression  was  used  to  analyse  primary  and  secondary  endpoints.  Time  to  clearance  of candidemia  was  assessed  by  Kaplan-Meier  estimation.  All  tests  performed  were  two-sided  and conducted using a significance level of 5%.

A hierarchical test procedure was applied with respect to the secondary endpoints. The effect of this was that no confirmatory claims could be based on variables that had a rank lower than the variable whose null hypothesis was the first that could be rejected.

## RESULTS

The disposition of patients is shown in the table 5.

The modified ITT population (MITT) used for efficacy included 56 patients in the Mycograb versus 61 in the placebo one.

## Recruitment

Patients  were  recruited  from  24  centres  in  10  European  countries  and  2  centres  in  the  USA.  The maximum number of patients in the modified ITT from a single centre was 20.

## Conduct of the study

The Good Clinical Practices inspection was conducted at Brno (site 21) and Prague (site 22) in the Czech Republic, from which a substantial number of patients where recruited [total number of patients recruited 51 of the 139 patients randomised (37%)]. Several critical and major findings were detected regarding  the  ethical,  safety  and  clinical  aspects  of  the  trial,  including  the  reporting  of  the  primary efficacy  variable,  and  overall  the  study  was  considered  not  to  be  reported  according  to  GCP.  The finding of the inspection is further discussed under the benefit/risk assessment section.

## Baseline data

Main baseline characteristics  of  patients  analysed  in  the  MITT  and  the  demographics  are  shown  in table 6. Overall the majority of patients were Caucasian and elderly, with a fourth being more than 70 years  and  most  baseline  characteristics  were  comparable  between  the  two  groups.  Compared  to previously  published  studies  of  disseminated  candidiasis,  the  frequency  of  polyfungal  infections, which have been associated with high mortality, was relatively high. The use of amphotericin B lipid complex  (86.5%  of  the  Placebo  group  and  87.5%  of  the  Mycograb  group)  and  amphotericin  B liposome for injection (13.1% of Placebo and 12.5% of Mycograb groups) was matched between the two treatment arms.

APACHE II: (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation 2 nd version); *statistically significant

Overall, APACHE scores, which is a validated scoring system devised for patients on intensive care units (ICU) to provide a measure of the severity of their condition and the risk of subsequent death (i.e the  higher  the  APACHE II score, the higher the risk of death) were well matched, with a trend for higher APACHE Scores among Mycograb-treated patients (21-25 and &gt; 25) compared to placebo.

The applicant further detailed description of malignancies and immunosuppression. More patients in the  placebo  group  had  malignancies  including  haematological  cancers.  In  contrast,  the  rate  of  solid cancers were comparable, 11 patients in the Mycograb group versus 10 patients in the placebo group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

had  solid  tumors,  of  which  5  were  metastatic  in  the  Mycograb  group  (45%),  compared  to  2  in  the placebo group (20%).

With respect to immunosuppression, 14 (23 %) in the placebo group were severely immunosuppressed compared to 9 (16 %) in Mycograb. No neutropenic patients were included in the Mycograb arm.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary Efficacy

The results on the primary efficacy variable are presented in table 8. In logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio for overall response was clearly in favour of combination therapy with Mycograb.

| 95% CI                                                 | (2.408, 13.787)    | (2.408, 13.787)     |

At  the  request  of  the  CHMP,  the  main  efficacy  analysis  was  redone  using  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT) population. In this analysis a conservative approach was taken with missing data classified as failures. There  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  favour  of  the  Mycograb  group  with  an  overall response shown in 79 % (54/68) versus in 51 % (35/69) in the placebo group (p &lt; 0.001).

A concern was raised with respect to the potentially low response in the placebo arm. The applicant provided data to show that the MITT complete response rate observed in the placebo arm was within the range of recent response rates reported in other published amphotericin B trials.

## Secondary endpoints

## Clinical and mycological response at Day 10.

The  results  for  these  two  secondary  endpoints  showed  a  highly  statistically  significant  difference between the two treatment arms (P &lt; 0.001).

Mycological clearance

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  rate  of  mycological  clearance  over  time  was  determined  by  recording  the  time  from  baseline positive cultures through to the time when the last positive culture was observed. The time to this point was analysed using survival analysis censoring when a last positive culture was not observed because the patient was withdrawn from the study or died. The rate of culture-confirmed clearance was over twice as fast in the Mycograb-treated group compared to the control group (Hazard ratio &gt; 2, P 0.001) (table 10).

Candida-attributable mortality at Day 33

Mycograb treatment was associated with significantly lower Candida-attributable mortality at Day 33 (table 11).

A Kaplan-Meier plot showed that Candida-attributable mortalities were most likely to have occurred by Day 12.

## Overall Mortality

The results did not show a statistically significant difference in terms of overall mortality in favour of Mycograb.  There  was  a  trend  in  favour  of  combination  therapy  one  week  after  completing  the Mycograb (day 12) but this difference had disappeared a month later, as shown in table 11.

## Ancillary analyses

A  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  on  the  primary  efficacy  variable  in  which  all  patients  who continued  to  receive  systemic  antifungal  therapy  (of  any  kind)  after  Day  10  of  the  study  were classified as failures. This showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups, 52% of the Mycograb group discontinuing systemic antifungals at day 10 have shown a complete clinical and mycological response, compared to 26% of the mono-amphotericin B group (P 0.005).

Two supportive analyses were performed also on the primary efficacy variable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The first one related to the brand of amphotericin B (amphotericin B lipid complex, or amphotericin B liposome for injection) with which the patient was treated. The use of both medicinal products was well  matched:  86.9%  (53)  of  the  placebo  group  and  87.5%  (49)  of  the  Mycograb  group  were  on amphotericin B lipid complex, while 13.1% (8) of the placebo group and 12.5% (7) of the Mycograb group received amphotericin B liposome for injection.

The second one related to the result of the germ tube test, a preliminary test for the identification of the species C. albicans . If there were discordant results between the germ tube test and subsequent species identification, the latter took priority since this was the definitive test.

Both supportive analyses showed a statistically significant difference between the two treatment arms (P &lt; 0.001) in favour of Mycograb group.

Several  analyses  examining  APACHE  Scores  were  done  to  support  the  efficacy  of  Mycograb. Mycograb-treated patients were more likely to have shown complete resolution by Day 10 irrespective of APACHE II score. In patients with APACHE II scores up to 10, the response rate was 100% on Mycograb, and 50-57% on placebo.

The analysis of death showed that in the Mycograb-treated group deaths most frequently occurred in patients with high APACHE II scores ( ≥ 25), and the commonest cause of death was bacterial sepsis followed by cancer. In contrast, Candida was the commonest cause of death in the group on placebo and,  with  one  exception,  these  deaths  occurred  in  patients  with  APACHE  II  scores  below  25.  This would  suggest  that,  in  terms  of  overall  mortality,  Mycograb  would  likely  have  greatest  benefit  in patients with APACHE II scores below 25.

The  applicant  analysed  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  to  a  subpopulation  with  a  positive candidaemia  and/or  positive  sample  from  a  normally  sterile  deep  site  -  excluding  the  20 patients entered  on  the  basis  of  positive  cultures  from  urine,  abdominal  drains  or  infected  burns.  This  gave similar, statistically significant differences between the two treatments groups as previously observed with the original MITT. For example:

-  The  overall  response  at  Day  10  doubled  from  40%  to  80%  (P&lt;0.001)  in  patients  with candidaemia and/or sterile site culture positive being treated with Mycograb.
-  Candida-attributable mortality fell from 21% to 5% in patients with candidaemia and/or sterile site culture positive receiving Mycograb (P&lt;0.05).
-  The  rate  of  culture-confirmed  clearance  of  the  infection  remained  over  twice  as  fast  in  the group receiving Mycograb (Hazard Ratio &gt; 2).

Again, all-cause mortality showed only a trend in favour of Mycograb. A subgroup analysis confined to  patients  with  candidaemia  showed  statistically  significant  differences  in  favour  of  combination therapy with respect to all primary and secondary endpoints.

In addition the applicant performed subgroup analysis examining response according to centre of enrolment (centres 21 and 22 enrolling most patients), immunosuppression, site of infection and prior antifungal treatment (table 12).

As shown in table 12 a qualitative assessment of these two centres showed a similar trend to that seen in the whole study. Applying the primary efficacy variable to the combined results obtained from the two Czech centres gave a statistically significant difference in overall response at Day 10 between the two treatment groups (Fisher's Exact Test, P = 0.0032). If excluding patients from these two centres from  the  primary  efficacy  analysis,  a  significant  difference  in  the  complete  overall  response  rate remained in favour of Mycograb.

With respect to site of infections, patients with abdominal candidiasis were the least likely to have the infection resolved by Day 10.

With  respect  to  prior  antifungal  treatment,  more  Mycograb-treated  patients  had  shown  a  complete clinical  and  mycological  response  compared  to  those  on  placebo,  although  the  success  rates  were considerably lower than those obtained from the study overall, but the numbers are limited.

A  detailed  review  of  9  patients  who  were  treated  with  Mycograb  but  failed  to  meet  the  primary efficacy endpoint showed that 5 patients failed on both clinical and mycological responses.

To examine the relation between response and efungumab doses/concentrations, a subgroup analysis was performed on patients with clinical failure. While these data demonstrate quite large inter patient variations  in  Mycograb  levels,  the  mean  values  were  not  significantly  different  in  clinical  failures compared to overall levels in the total population, except at Day 1 when the mean value tended to be lower.

Sera  from  the  confirmatory  study  were  analysed  with  respect  to  gender  and  age.  No  significant difference between male and female patients was found, although the mean levels were slightly higher in the female patients. This was most pronounced when the Day 3 levels were examined but this trend had disappeared by Day 5.  The group of patients who were over 70 years of age was then examined. This demonstrated slightly higher levels on Day 1. This difference had disappeared by Day 3 so that there was no clear difference from the overall levels.

Further, subgroup analysis for respiratory, renal, liver and clinical failure and the presence of antibodies against Mycograb did not demonstrate any group of patients in whom the mean value was more than one standard deviation from base line.

- Clinical studies in special population

The efficacy of Mycograb has not currently been evaluated in paediatric population or in other special population.

## Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

At the initial submission, the safety database for Mycograb comprised all patients who had received at least one dose of treatment in the open-label and randomised trials.

Safety data were subsequently provided from two additional studies, one in healthy volunteers (n=18 NTP/Mycograb/HuPK/001) and one open label in patients with breast cancer receiving Mycograb+docetaxel (n=20NTP/ONC/001) and from a compassionate use programme in patients with invasive candidiasis (n=17).

In the clinical trial, all adverse events were reported by the investigators up to day 33, after which only serious ones were recorded.

## Adverse events

## Confirmatory trial

In  the  confirmatory  trial  34  (61%)  of  the  Mycograb  treated  patients  were  intubated  and  38%  of patients  were  given  pre-medication  to  cover  amphotericin  B.  Treatment-emergent  adverse  events (TEA)  was  reported  by  97  %  of  Mycograb  treated  patients  compared  to  88%  of  placebo  treated patients. However, only 7% of TEA was judged to be possibly directly related to the study drug. Due to the severity of pathologies in the ICU population, the casual relationship between study drug and AE were complicated by co-administration of multiple  other  drugs  including  amphotericin  B  in  all patients and vasopressors in half of patients.

Frequencies of AE, which occurred in 2 or more patients receiving Mycograb, are displayed in table 14. The following adverse events were commoner in the Mycograb-treated group: septic shock (17.6% versus 10.1%), urinary tract infections (5.9% versus 1.4%), tachycardia (5.9% versus 0), multi-organ failure  (14.7%  versus  5.8%),  thrombocytopenia  (7.4%versus  0),  hypertension  (7.4%  versus  2.9%), decubitus ulcer (4.4% versus 0) and back pain (4.4% versus 0).

AE more common in the placebo group were: Nausea (7.2% versus 0), hypokalaemia (13% versus 5.9%) and drug hypersensitivity (5.8% versus 0), of which 2 cases were caused by hypersensitivity to amphotericin B.

The higher number of septic shock were not considered temporally related to the administration of Mycograb, as the shock occurred days or week after the administration in 11 of 12 patients.

Cardiac disorders  were  observed  in  21%  of  the  Mycograb  treated,  of  which  7%  had  cardiac  arrest. These AE were considered unrelated to Mycograb.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

Among Mycograb-treated,  52%  (36)  of  patients  reported  SAE,  the  most  commonly  observed  were sepsis and/or multiorgan failure (21 patients). A similar number of SAE was observed in the placebogroup.  There  were  no  SAEs  which  were  thought  to  be  causally  related  to  the  study  drug  by  the investigators, the sponsor or the independent expert.

Deaths  occurred  among  26  Mycograb  treated  patients  up  to  day  33  compared  to  21  in  the  placebo group.  A  detailed  narrative  has  been  submitted  by  the  applicant,  from  which  it  appears  that  it  is improbable that any of the deaths were Mycograb related.

## Other Significant Adverse Events and discontinuation

Episodes  of  hypertension  were  more  common  among  Mycograb-treated  patients  and  were  in  most cases directly related to the infusion. In 4 of the 5 affected patients, the hypertensive episode began 0.5 to 1.5h after the first dose of Mycograb and lasted from 20 minutes to 15h. With one exception the hypertension  was  mild  or  moderate,  and  resolved  without  sequelae  and  without  the  need  for concomitant treatment. In 4 cases the patients were on vasopressors, because their blood pressure had been too low.

Lumbar  back  pain  was  the  adverse  event  most  closely  associated,  in  time,  with  repeated  doses  of Mycograb.  Two  patients  developed  back  pain,  which  was  temporally  related  to  the  Mycograb infusion. In each case it occurred transiently, recurring in association with several doses of Mycograb, but it did not occur with the last two doses. The severity was categorized as mild in one patient and moderate  in  the  other.  In  each  case  it  resolved  without  action  being  taken.  In  neither  case  did  the patient or the investigator wish to discontinue study treatment.

A low titre of human anti-drug antibody (HADA) occurred in 11% of patients in the pivotal study, and this was not associated with any loss of efficacy or adverse reactions. The treatment was discontinued in 2 patients in the Mycograb group, due to adverse events compatible with infusion reaction.

With respect to laboratory findings, the data are too small to exclude any role of Mycrograb in the numerically increased incidence of thrombocytopenia  (7.4 % versus 0 in placebo).

## Safety data in healthy volunteers

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  healthy  volunteer  study,  the  tolerability  was  poor  at  all  dose  levels.  Infusion-related  adverse reactions  were  much  commoner  in  healthy  volunteers  than  patients  with  invasive  Candidiasis.  The commonest adverse reaction after the first dose was nausea and/or vomiting (experienced by 28 out of 30  subjects  following  the  first  dose),  followed  by  headaches  (26  subjects),  rigors  (23),  pain  (19), pyrexia (6), paraesthesia (3) and flushing (1). Most events were mild or moderate and lasted usually a few hours. The adverse events did recur after repeated administration but were usually milder. One out of five individuals with a repeat dose at 0.25mg/kg and three out of five at the 1.0mg/kg dose level withdraw from the study.

All  adverse  reactions  had  become  mild  after  the  second  dose  with  the  exception  of  headaches (described as moderately severe in two subjects after the third and fourth dose respectively).

The phlebitis observed at the infusion site is probably due to presence of a denaturant, which is used as an excipient. It was not observed in the previous studies in patients with invasive Candidiasis, because the  Mycograb  was  administered  as  an  intravenous  bolus  injection  over  10  minutes  using  a  central venous catheter.

The cytokine data from the healthy volunteers suggest that most observed adverse effect were related to  cytokine  response. The  peak  value  of  the  initial  TNF-alfa  and  IL-6  response  observed  for  the proposed clinical dosage of 1 mg/kg were high and comparable to cytokine levels reported in patients who experience severe side effects or tumor lysis from treatment with other antibody based products.

Human anti-drug antibody (HADA) levels in healthy volunteers were similar to those in patients with invasive candidiasis, but occurred more frequently (55% versus 11%). Most healthy volunteers had slightly  elevated  levels  of  anti-Mycograb  already  at  day  5.  However,  there  was  no  link  between HADA response and adverse events and HADA was unlikely to be involved in the reactions seen in healthy volunteers during the initial days of treatment.

13 subjects experienced a rise in neutrophil count having peak counts &gt; 8 x109/l.

## Safety data from the Breast Cancer Study

In this study Mycograb was given using a dosage schedule significantly different from that used in the treatment of invasive candidiasis or in the healthy volunteer study:

- The dose given was doubled to 2 mg/kg for up to two doses in 8 hours
- The Mycograb was given in cycles, every 3 weeks, which would be likely to maximise any immunogenicity.

Most of the adverse events reported as Mycograb-related by the investigator were as expected, namely (in  descending  order  of  frequency):  injection  site  reactions,  pain,  chills,  pyrexia,  headaches,  nausea and  vomiting,  flushing,  paraesthesia,  and,  in  one  patient,  hypertension.  The  interpretation  of  the observed AE and SAE in this trial remains confounded by the frequent and to some extent overlapping toxicity  from  the  concomitant  docetaxel  treatment.  It  is  unclear  whether  all  patients  had  steroids  as pre-medication as recommended in the product information of docetaxel.

One patient developed severe hypertension and chills 50 minutes after receiving her first cycle of high dose  Mycograb (2 mg/kg) and therefore  was  withdrawn  from  the  study.  This  fully  resolved  within 3  hours,  without  sequelae.  Hypertension  occurs  with  a  frequency  of  2.4%  in  patients  on  docetaxel. Therefore it is likely that the hypertension was causally related to the high dose of Mycograb, but may have  been  exacerbated  by  the  docetaxel.  None  of  the  20  patients  in  the  cancer  study  developed hypertension following the 1 mg/kg dose of Mycograb.

There  were  two  further  serious  adverse  events  attributed  by  the  investigators  to  Mycograb,  both dyspnoea at rest (which by definition is severe). Both occurred with the second course of 2 mg/kg b.d. Mycograb, administered just after the fifth cycle of docetaxel. Both resolved, without sequelae.

Although most SAE probably were primarily docetaxel related, possible Mycograb related infusion reactions were commonly observed including one hypertensive episode.

Most  patients  study  developed  antibodies,  mainly  of  IgG  class  to  Mycograb.  IgM  class  antibodies were also demonstrated along with IgG.

## Compassionate Use Programme

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Preliminary data on 17 patients with severe invasive fungal infections treated with Mycograb in the compassionate use program during the last year has been provided. Several severe infusion reactions with hypertension were observed.

## Safety in special populations

There are currently no safety data in special populations

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

So far no interaction has been identified. Adverse interactions with other drugs were not anticipated because  Mycograb,  being  derived  from  a  naturally  occurring  antibody,  is  not  metabolised  by cytochrome P450.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

Efungumab,  the  active  substance  of  Mycograb  is  a  monoclonal  antibody  fragment.  The  following quality deficiencies have not been satisfactorily resolved:

- The  characterisation  studies  performed  under  native  conditions  clearly  indicate  that  the efungumab  protein  forms  aggregates  in  solution.  The  root  cause  of  the  aggregation  is unknown. The aggregates of Mycograb drug substance are not adequately controlled by the proposed control method.
- Validation of the refolding step has not been performed. Instead, an in-process method is used to control the process at the drug substance level and in addition, CD is proposed for the drug product  specifications.  In  view  of  the  lack  of  validation  data  for  in-process  method,  the unconvincing  CD  data  provided  and  the  inappropriateness  of  this  method  for  controlling refolding, the refolding step of the protein is not adequately controlled.

•

- One host cell protein (HCP) appears to co-purify together with Mycograb and can therefore not  be  removed  from  the  product.  This  HCP  is  present  at  a  high  level  in  the  final  product compared to other parental preparations. Such a high level can have an impact on the safety (immunogenicity),  which  has  to  be  considered  with  respect  to  use  in  patients  (repetitive administration) and results from clinical trials. The proposed HCP assay may be suitable for the detection of this particular HCP and to confirm the level of this particular impurity but it is not suitable for the detection of the overall levels of HCPs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As a consequence, the quality of the product is not controlled in a satisfactory way and the evidence provided was not sufficient to conclude that the manufacturing process and the methods of control will guarantee  the  uniform  clinical  performance  of  the  product.  The  presence  and  lack  of  control  of aggregates is of particular concern and needs to be considered from a non-clinical/clinical perspective. The  presence  of  high  levels  of  host  cell  proteins  in  the  final  product  can  impact  on  the  safety (immunogenicity) of the product. Overall there are remaining issues related to the quality aspects of the product and their potential impact on safety.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Efungumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody targeting the immunodominant epitope of Candida hsp90.  Overall  the  primary  pharmacodynamics  of  efungumab  has  been  reasonably  demonstrated. When used in combination with amphothericin B, Mycograb has greater antifungal activity against a wide range Candida species, including C. albicans , parapsilosis , C. glabatra , C. tropicalis , C. Krusei . In-vivo activity was confirmed in a murine model. Taken together, these findings support the clinical use of efungumab.

Mycograb did not induce cytotoxicity or apoptosis in murine cells cultured in vitro.

The safety and secondary pharmacology has been adequately addressed and a dose-related effect of Mycograb on heart rate and blood pressure as has also been observed in patients given Mycograb was observed in anesthetised dogs. The pharmacokinetic data in animals are limited.

Non-clinical safety data are mainly based on GLP-compliant 14-day repeated dose toxicity studies in the CD-1 mouse and cynomolgus monkeys and an embryo foetal development toxicity study in CD-1 mice. Results did not reveal any special hazard for humans.  Increased mortality was observed in mice given repeated doses of Mycograb in the high dose group but the clinical importance of this finding is unknown. Mortality was also reported in the embryo-foetal study.

Mycograb was considered teratogenic in this mouse study (Cleft palate and exencephaly observed). There are no data on the excretion of Mycograb in the milk of lactating women or animals.

Mycograb does not induce human hepatocyte P450 enzymes in vitro, and is unlikely to have any such effect in vivo.

## Efficacy

The applicant initially did not provide adequate data to characterise the pharmacokinetics profile of efungumab. The gel assay initially used was abandoned and two new PK studies were initiated one in healthy volunteers and one in patients with advanced state breast cancer. These data gave better insight of the PK although these studies have been performed in too small number of patients to be robust. After  intravenous  administration,  Mycograb  is  rapidly  cleared  from  the  circulation.  Overall  all  PK parameters are associated with significant inter-subject variability.

The  demonstration  of  efficacy  rest  on  the  single  pivotal  trial.  This  trial  002  was  a  double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, multicenter trial to compare the efficacy and safety of Mycograb plus lipid  formulation  of  amphotericin  B  versus  placebo  plus  lipid  formulation  of  amphotericin  B  in treatment  of  deep-seated Candida infections . The majority  of  137  patients  who  completed  the  trial were Caucasian and elderly, with a fourth being more than 70 years and most baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups.

Results  demonstrated  significant  superiority  for  Mycograb  treatment  in  terms  of  overall  response (clinical and mycological), clinical response, Candida -attributable mortality and mycological clearance. Results showed that at the recommended dose of 1 mg/kg twice a day for 5 days, clinical and  culture-confirmed  resolution  of  the  infection  was  achieved  in  47  out  of  56  patients  (84%) compared  to  29  out  of  61  (48%)  on  mono-amphotericin  B  (P&lt;0.001).  Prolongation  of  Mycograbtreatment beyond 10 doses was not allowed under the protocol. The results did not show, however, any benefit in overall mortality, especially at day 33 [20/61 (33%) in placebo versus, 26/56 (46%) in Mycograb].  Submitted  sensitivity  analysis  on  baseline  characteristics  supports  the  demonstration  of efficacy,  with  overall  equivalence  in  terms  of  APACHE  II  scores  at  baseline  and  a  significant reduction in Candida -attributable mortality for Mycograb treated patients, when analyzing deaths in relation to APACHE scores.  Further there was overall good agreement between the hard endpoints of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mycological  clearance  and  the  softer  endpoint  of  clinical  response.  In  terms  of  malignancy  and immunosuppression treatment arms were not completely comparable, however the applicant demonstrated efficacy across a range of sensitivity analysis taking these measures into account.

Interpretation  of  this  trial  is  complicated  by  the  high  presence  of  serious  underlying  disease,  the composite  primary  endpoint,  which  included  the  somewhat  subjective  endpoint  of  investigatorassigned 'resolution of pre-treatment signs and symptoms of candidosis' and by difficulties to exclude the impact of baseline characteristics, related to co-morbidity, such as malignancy and immunosuppression. These issues, led to a GCP inspection at Brno (site 21) and Prague (site 22) in the Czech Republic, from which a substantial number of patients where recruited. According to the GCP inspectors, the protocol was not clear with respect to inclusion and efficacy assessment and assessment of clinical response was subjective at best. In addition, samples for fungal and bacterial cultures were not taken for all patients as dictated by the protocol. A further issue was related to the reporting of data and assessment by the so-called independent expert who was assessing the adverse event reports. The inspection team concluded that the pivotal study had not been conducted and reported in compliance with GCP.

The CHMP considered that, while the GCP inspection has raised several critical findings, the main efficacy findings of the pivotal study were not invalidated. From the two centers, in general data and assessment  of  most  patients  included  in  the  analyses  seemed  to  be  correct.  Further,  in  most  cases, clinical response was supported by mycological response and in general there was overall agreement in  the  assessment  of  clinical  response  between  the  investigator  and  independent  expert.  In  the inspectors report all numerical data reported were regarded as valid. Further, no inconsistencies were detected between previous medical records, case report forms and sponsor database.

There is currently insufficient clinical experience of Mycograb in combination with antifungal drugs other than amphothericin B.

The efficacy of Mycograb has not been tested in neutropenic patients.

## Safety

The safety database comprised the data from the early studies and the confirmatory trial together with data  derived  from  the  studies  performed  in  human  volunteers,  patients  with  breast  cancer  and  from compassionate use programme. The total numbers being exposed to Mycograb attained just over 100 patients,  which  is  still  a  small  size  database  rendering  difficult  the  interpretation  of  adverse  events especially in the critically ill patients with various co-morbidities.

In  the  confirmatory  trial  34  (61%)  of  the  Mycograb  treated  patients  were  intubated  and  38%  of patients were given pre-medication to cover amphotericin B. Treatment-emergent AE was reported by 97 % of Mycograb treated patients compared to 88% of placebo treated patients. Septic shock was most frequently reported followed by multi-organ failure and hypertension occurring after the 1 st dose, and  thrombocytopenia.  However,  only  7%  of  treatment-emergent  adverse  event  was  judged  to  be possibly  directly  related  to  efungumab.  Due  to  the  severity  of  pathologies  in  the  studied  ICU population, the casual relation ship between study drug and AE were complicated by co-administration of multiple other drugs including amphotericin B in all patients and vasopressors in half of patients.

In the study in healthy volunteers, Mycograb was poorly tolerated with four individuals withdrawing from  the  study  and  virtually  all  patients  experiencing  adverse  event:  pain  in  back  or  extremities, headache,  chills,  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  syncope,  hypotension,  dyspnoea,  and  injection  site reactions. Most events were mild or moderate and lasted usually a few hours. The adverse events did recur after repeated administration but were usually milder.

Data on circulating cytokine levels from this study suggest that most of the observed adverse events were  related  to  cytokine  response.  Although  cytokine  release  and  initial  infusion  reactions  such  as chills,  nausea and headache became less severe with repeated administration it also noted that there was no clear association between the severity of adverse effects and the levels of IL-6, TNFα or IFNγ .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the breast cancer trial, interpretation of observed AE and SAE in this trial remains confounded by the  frequent  and  to  some  extent  overlapping  toxicity  from  the  concomitant  docetaxel  treatment. Although  it  is  acknowledged  that  most  SAE  probably  were  primarily  docetaxel  related,  possible Mycograb related infusion reactions were commonly observed including one hypertensive episode. In addition  it  is  unclear  whether  all  patients  had  steroids  as  pre-medication  as  recommended  in  the product information of docetaxel.

Data from the compassionate use program has also been submitted. A total of 17 patients have now been treated. Several severe hypertensive episodes were observed in connection with first infusions of Mycograb.

In the healthy volunteer and breast cancer trial the majority of patients developed a HADA response, however  there  are  so  far  no  data  to  suggest  that  the  development  of  HADA  is  linked  to  specific adverse effects, the cytokine release syndrome or diminished response to Mycograb. So far, limited data from the pivot trial suggest that the development of weak HADA responses will not impair the response to Mycograb. However, it remains possible that HADA could be of consequence in patients who should need re-administration of Mycograb.

The  use  of  Mycograb  is  commonly  associated  with  a  cytokine  release  syndrome,  which  may  have significant clinical consequences, including severe hypertension. Based on the structure and target of Mycograb, this syndrome was not expected and the pathogenesis of the cytokine release is currently unknown.

During an oral explanation in front of the CHMP, the applicant addressed further the safety issues in relation to the cytokine release, hypertension and the potential impact of the aggregates on the safety profile of the product. The applicant argued that the cytokine release syndrome observed is not linked to  the  presence  of  aggregates  and  Mycograb  itself  but  linked  to  hsp  90  that  may  be  present  on  the surface  on  human  white  blood  cells.  This  hypothesis  raises  new  safety  concerns.  The  applicant suggested also a mechanism of hypertension and claimed that there were no clinical manifestations of aggregations seen in the safety such as amyloidosis and renal nephropathy.

## User consultation

The  applicant  performed  an  initial  user  consultation,  followed  by  a  second  one  which  was  overall considered adequate.

## Risk-benefit assessment

Invasive Candidiasis continues to carry a high mortality despite available anti-fungal agents. Mycograb (efungumab) has been developed as a new therapeutic approach intended for the treatment of invasive candidiasis in adult patients, in combination with amphotericin B or a lipid formulation of amphotericin B.

Efungumab is directed to heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) which plays a vital role in fungal cell survival. Efungumab  is  a  single-chain  Fv  human  monoclonal  antibody  fragment  produced  in E.  coli by recombinant DNA technology where the variable domain of the heavy chain (VH) is connected to the variable domain of the light chain (VL) with a linker.

Mycograb was designated as an orphan medicinal product.

The CHMP considered that there are remaining issues related to the quality aspects of this product and their  potential  impact  on  safety.  The  evidence  provided  was  not  sufficient  to  conclude  that  the manufacturing process and the methods of control will guarantee the uniform clinical performance of the product. In particular: the quality of the product is not controlled in a satisfactory way with respect to the distribution of high molecular weight aggregates, the refolding of the molecule and the levels of host cell proteins.

Based  on  the  data  provided,  the  efficacy  has  been  demonstrated  with  reasonable  certainty,  with  an important reduction of Candida-associated mortality although it did not translate into a reduction of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

overall mortality. This discrepancy may be due to imbalance in the co-morbidities but may also be due to unexpected toxicity.

The safety of Mycograb was considered not to be fully established. The causal relationship between efungumab and adverse events was difficult  to  assess  because  of  the  severity  of  pathologies  in  the critically  ill  population  in  Intensive  Care  Unit,  complicated  by  co-administration  of  multiple  other drugs including amphotericin B in all patients and vasopressors in half of patients. The other important concern  related  to  a  cytokine  release  syndrome  which  could  manifest  itself  as  clinically  significant AEs,  including  severe  hypertension  commonly  associated  with  the  first  dose  of  Mycograb.  The pathogenetic basis of the cytokine release is unclear.

The  size  of  the  safety  dataset  was  also  too  limited  to  alleviate  the  concerns  related  to  the  quality aspects

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Mycograb was unfavourable for the applied indication. The CHMP has recommended therefore the refusal of the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for Mycograb.

## 3 RE-EXAMINATION OF THE CHMP OPINION OF 15 NOVEMBER 2006

At  the  November  2006  CHMP  meeting  following  discussion  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation Application  for  Mycograb,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  overall  benefit/risk  for  Mycograb  in  the treatment  of  invasive  candidiasis  in  adult  patients,  in  combination  with  amphotericin  B  or  a  lipid formulation of amphotericin B was negative.

The grounds for refusal stated in the negative opinion for Mycograb were:

- -The evidence provided was not sufficient to conclude that the manufacturing process and the methods  of  control  will  guarantee  the  uniform  clinical  performance  of  the  product.  In particular: the quality of the product is not controlled in a satisfactory way with respect to the presence of aggregates, the refolding of the molecule and the levels of host cell proteins.
- -The safety profile of Mycograb is not fully established because of the uncertainties over the pathogenetic  basis  of  the  cytokine  release  syndrome,  which  is  commonly  associated  with administration of Mycograb and which may manifest itself as clinically significant adverse effects, including severe hypertension.
- -The size of the safety dataset is too limited to alleviate the concerns related to the quality aspects.

The applicant submitted written notice  requesting a  re-examination on 24 November 2006, and the detailed grounds for the re-examination request were submitted on 19 January 2007. A meeting of the BWP including additional experts was held on 12 March 2007 and the CHMP Scientific Advisory Group on Anti-infectives (SAG-Anti-infectives) was convened on 13 March 2007 in preparation of the CHMP meeting on 19-22 March 2007.

The applicant gave oral explanations at the BWP and SAG-Anti-infectives meetings and at the CHMP meeting, respectively on 12, 13 and 20 March 2007.

## Grounds for refusal 1:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -The  evidence  provided  was  not  sufficient  to  conclude  that  the  manufacturing  process  and  the methods of control will guarantee the uniform clinical performance of the product. In particular: the  quality  of  the  product  is  not  controlled  in  a  satisfactory  way  with  respect  to  the  presence  of aggregates, the refolding of the molecule and the levels of host cell proteins.

## 1. Presence of high molecular weight aggregates

Efungumab  has  'a  clear  tendency  to  form  aggregates.  Aggregation  is  not  uncommon  amongst biologically-active proteins, including single-chain antibody fragments (scFvs), and its existence is not considered to be a problem per se . Aggregates would be acceptable if they are properly characterised and  consistency  of  production  can  be  demonstrated.  The  uncontrolled  presence  of  aggregates  has potential to influence the in vivo activity of Mycograb, and in particular may have an adverse impact on the clinical safety, and therefore it needs to be controlled by means of the application of appropriate specifications, lot to lot consistency needs to be established for it, and the stability studies for the drug substance (DS) and drug product (DP) need to be taken it into account.

During the course of the initial assessment, the applicant described how a variety of techniques for monitoring protein aggregation were  investigated, and the applicant proposed  size exclusion chromatography (SEC) as a suitable method.

The previous findings with respect to this method were re-examined and the 2006 CHMP opinion is maintained,  i.e.  that  the  previously  presented  SEC  method  was  neither  suitable  for  controlling aggregation in the product nor adequately validated. Instead of providing arguments in support of the previously  described  SEC  method,  the  company  has  submitted  new  data  with  their  grounds  for  reexamination  to  introduce  a  modified  SEC  system  to  measure  efungumab  aggregates.  The  reexamination  procedure  may  be  based  only  on  the  scientific  data  available  when  the  Committee adopted  the  initial  opinion.  Even  if  the  modified  method  were  to  be  considered,  outstanding  issues would remain that would need to be addressed concerning this method as well as with respect to the control of aggregates.

Therefore it is not possible to conclude that the manufacturing process and the methods of control will guarantee an appropriate control of aggregate size and as a consequence guarantee the uniform clinical performance of the product. On the basis of the assessment of the quality information submitted by the applicant  with  their  grounds  for  re-examination,  the  conclusions  of  the  2006  CHMP  opinion  are maintained and the major objection remains.

## 2. High level of host cell protein (HCP)

For control of HCP in Mycograb two assays have been used. A commercially available HCP ELISA measures E. coli lysate proteins by using antiE.coli polyclonal antiserum. The ELISA is used for drug product release. As it became clear that this assay does not detect one specific HCP, a second method was developed to measure this HCP.

- Though no general limits for host cell proteins are defined in guidelines or monographs, the proposed  limit  for  one  specific  HCP  is  unusually  high  for  a  highly  purified  monoclonal antibody. On the basis of experience with the assessment of recombinant proteins which have been licensed, it is known that there are technical possibilities to reduce these impurities to lower levels. In comparison to these drug products - including recombinant proteins produced in E. coli - the total level of HCP in Mycograb is much higher.
- Based on the fact, that a second HCP was necessary to quantify a specific HCP, it is not clear if the currently used ELISA is suitable and able to detect and quantify all other relevant HCPs from E. coli . There is concern, that other HCPs, which are not detectable by both assays could increase the total amount of HCP in the product to higher levels.
- Generally  the  presence  of  host  cell  proteins  as  impurities  in  drug  products  of  recombinant proteins  raises  the  question  of  an  adverse  impact  on  immunogenicity.  This  is  of  particular concern for Mycograb which contains 10 mg DS per vial.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The  HCP  impurity  was  discovered  by  the  inspectors  at  the  occasion  of  a  GMP  inspection conducted late during the evaluation process..

Therefore,  on  the  basis  of  the  re-examination  of  previously  submitted  data,  it  remains  a  fact  that efungumab may include a high level of one specific HCP. On the basis of the assessment of the quality information submitted by the applicant with their grounds for re-examination, the conclusions of the 2006 CHMP opinion are maintained and the major objection remains.

## 3. Control of protein refolding

There  are  two  aspects  of  the  structure  of  the  refolded  protein  which  need  to  be  addressed,  namely control of secondary structure and control of the folded structure. The amount of information available on the nature of the structure of efungumab appears to be limited.

Towards  the  end  the  initial  assessment  procedure  (end  of  2006),  the  applicant  was  introducing  a proposal  to  use  an  in-process  method  to  monitor  the  development  of  the  secondary  structure  of efungumab during production, i.e. use it as an in-process control. One of the grounds for the negative opinion on Mycograb at the time was that validation of the in-process method was lacking. The basis of  that  negative  opinion  has  been  re-examined,  and  is  maintained  on  the  basis  of  the  information available at the time of the first CHMP opinion.

With  the  submission  of  their  grounds  for  re-examination,  the  applicant  has  submitted  new  data  to document that the in-process method has now been validated according to EU/ICH guidelines. The reexamination  procedure  may  be  based  only  on  the  scientific  data  available  when  the  Committee adopted the initial opinion. If the validation data were to be considered, the in-process method could be accepted as suitable for use as an in-process control for monitoring secondary structure formation (although this has not been directly demonstrated).

Towards the end the initial assessment procedure (end of 2006), the applicant was proposing to apply a routine CD release test at the DP level. One of the grounds for the negative CHMP opinion in 2006 was  the  inadequacy  of  the  proposed  CD  release  method,  which  was  not  fully  validated.  The information has been re-examined and the negative opinion on the issue is maintained.

Instead  of  supporting  the  previously  described  CD  method  as  a  suitable  batch  release  method,  the applicant  has  submitted  new  data  with  the  grounds  for  re-examination  to  propose  a  much-modified version  of  the  CD  assay.  The  re-examination  procedure  may  be  based  only  on  the  scientific  data available when the Committee adopted the initial opinion. If this new data were to be considered, this method  could  be  accepted  as  a  method  to  distinguish  between  unfolded  and  folded  molecules  and considering this method together with the in-process testing, it could be considered that the lack of suitable methods to control protein refolding would no longer constitute a major objection.

Therefore, on the basis of the data available at the time of the CHMP opinion of 16 November 2006, the  grounds  for  re-examination  provided  by  the  applicant  do  not  change  the  initial  opinion  of  the CHMP which was that the quality of the medicinal product is not controlled in a satisfactory way with respect to control of the refolding of the molecule.

## Grounds for refusal 2:

- -The  safety  profile  of  Mycograb  is  not  fully  established  because  of  the  uncertainties  over  the pathogenetic  basis  of  the  cytokine  release  syndrome,  which  is  commonly  associated  with administration of Mycograb and which may manifest itself as clinically significant adverse effects, including severe hypertension.

## a) Cytokine Release Syndrome

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Regarding the measurement of IL-6 levels in the clinical trial the CHMP concludes that although IL-6 is likely a relevant proinflammatory cytokine the determination of IL-6 alone may not be considered sufficient  to  characterise  a  potential  cytokine  release  syndrome  in  this  complex  patient  population. Despite the arguments from the applicant the CHMP considers the healthy volunteer study as a valid and important pointer to the fact that administration of Mycograb may in some circumstances cause a cytokine  release  syndrome.  With  regard  to  the  pathogenetic  mechanism  for  the  cytokine  release syndrome  the  CHMP  still  considered  this  to  be  unclear;  the  basis  for  the  differential  secretion  of cytokines, as proposed by the applicant, has not been sufficiently addressed and remains unknown.

Cytokine release syndrome is a clinical syndrome caused by a variety of medicinal products. In the confirmatory study with patients suffering from severe candida sepsis, 61% of the patients receiving Mycograb were intubated, therefore in those patients identification of symptoms of cytokine release syndrome is difficult and for some symptoms as chills, headache, and nausea impossible. Therefore the incidence of those symptoms may be underestimated; the true incidence of cytokine release in this patient set is unknown and could only be estimated by direct determination of a comprehensive set of cytokines.  Furthermore,  sepsis  symptoms  and  symptoms  of  cytokine  release  will  be  very  similar; therefore  it  will  be  difficult  or  even  impossible  to  identify  newly  occurring  symptoms  of  cytokine release syndrome.

The SAG Anti-infectives  concluded  that  it  may  be  difficult  to  diagnose  cytokine  release  syndrome clinically in the intended population, and that IL-6 levels cannot be used to diagnose a cytokine release syndrome including its severity. The position was however that cytokine release syndrome could be detected if clinically overt and managed with corticosteroids and anti-histamines on a short-term basis; possible long-term consequences cannot be predicted.

The CHMP, taking into consideration the recommendations from the SAG Anti-infectives as well as the assessment report from the Rapporteurs, concluded that that the cytokine release syndrome could be managed in this particular patient population. However, more data from a controlled study would be needed to further explore the cytokine response; the Mycograb and control group should reflect the use of other products for the treatment of candidiasis.

## b) Hypertension

The  applicant  hypothesises  that  the  observed  hypertension  is  a  mere  reversal  of  hsp90  induced hypotension via NO synthesis. Overall, this explanation for hypertensive episodes is not considered plausible on the basis of the data provided which appeared to be related to human hsp90 rather than candida hsp90.

The CHMP considers the observed hypertension of relevance due to findings in preclinical studies in a predictive animal model, the breast cancer trial as well as healthy volunteers data, respectively. It is recognized though that cytokine release syndrome is, in its severe form, accompanied by a decrease in blood  pressure;  therefore  it  appears  possible  that  this  hypertensive  reaction  is  independent  from cytokine release.

The  SAG  Anti-infectives  concluded  that  on  the  basis  of  the  available  data  hypertension  does  not appear to be a major clinical problem and could be dealt with by appropriate safety measures during the  administration  of  the  product,  e.g.  appropriate  monitoring  and  prolonged  administration  time. However, it was emphasised that the adequacy of these recommendations for administration would need confirmation by actual study data.

The CHMP, taking into consideration the recommendations from the SAG Anti-infectives as well as the assessment report from the Rapporteurs, concluded that hypertension needs to be recognized with the use of Mycograb and that clear instructions with regard to blood pressure monitoring are required; the reduction of the infusion rate might help to mitigate the issue however supporting data needs to be generated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Grounds for refusal 3:

- -The size of the safety dataset is too limited to alleviate the concerns related to the quality aspects.

Significant safety concerns relating to Mycograb were cytokine release syndrome and hypertension, which appear to be manageable.

The applicant's analysis which concentrates on active treatment only and which divides an incomplete population into seven according to the drug batch they received is not helpful in addressing the safety concerns; the apparently huge inter-batch variability is likely to be an artefact of the variable and small numbers exposed to each batch.

The  size  of  the  safety  database  is  of  concern.  The  SAG  Anti-Infectives  expressed  the  need  for  a dedicated  safety  study,  that  should  have  a  control  group  to  further  explore  in  particular  the  safety issues cytokine release and hypertension. The control group should reflect the use of other products for the treatment of candidiasis.

The  CHMP,  taking  into  consideration  the  recommendations  from  the  SAG-AI  as  well  as  the assessment  report  from  the  Rapporteurs,  concluded  that  overall  size  of  the  safety  database  is  of concern and hence - also to further explore the described issues - a comparative safety study should be requested  to  generate  an  adequate  dataset;  this  study  should  also  compare  Mycograb  with  current treatment options.

## Overall conclusions on benefit/risk assessment

## Quality aspects

On the basis of the data available at the time of the first CHMP opinion of 16 November 2006, the grounds for re-examination provided by the applicant do not change the initial opinion of the CHMP which  was  that  the  quality  of  the  product  is  not  controlled  in  a  satisfactory  way  with  respect  to aggregates, the refolding of the molecule and the levels of host cell proteins.

With the submission of the grounds of re-examination, the applicant has presented new data. Even if this  new  data  were  to  be  considered,  it  would  not  change  the  initial  opinion  with  respect  to  the aggregates and the levels of host cell proteins.

Aggregation is not uncommon amongst biologically-active proteins, including single-chain antibody fragments (scFvs), and its existence is not considered to be a problem per se . Aggregates would only be acceptable if properly characterised and if consistency of production can be demonstrated.

As a consequence, the CHMP concludes that in view of the limited characterisation of aggregates and poor control of batch-to-batch consistency with respect to these aggregates, the manufacturing process and the methods of control do not guarantee the uniform clinical performance of the product. Overall it  is  acknowledged  that  Mycograb  presents  an  innovative  and  clinically  promising  approach, nevertheless there are remaining issues related to the quality aspects of the product, which would need to be resolved due to their potential impact on efficacy and safety.

## Clinical safety aspects

The CHMP concludes that the safety issues concerning cytokine release syndrome and hypertension, although  not  entirely  resolved,  are  manageable  in  clinical  practice.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  removed their concern stated in the CHMP opinion in November 2006 regarding the cytokine release syndrome and hypertension.  Nevertheless, further  studies  are  warranted  to  explore  the  potential  impact  of  the prolonged infusion time in order to mitigate the events related to cytokine release syndrome as well as hypertension.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The size of the clinical database is however considered too small and requires additional data from a comparative safety study.

## Benefit / risk assessment

Overall, the data presented support a clinical benefit for Mycograb for the indication i.e. treatment of invasive  candidiasis  in  adult  patients,  in  combination  with  amphotericin B  or  a  lipid  formulation  of amphotericin B. As regards the observed safety profile, the safety issues concerning cytokine release syndrome and hypertension are considered clinically manageable. However, there are remaining major outstanding issues with regard to the quality of the product, and in particular in view of the limited characterisation  of  aggregates  and  poor  control  of  batch-to-batch  consistency  with  respect  to aggregates; based on this it is considered that the manufacturing process and the methods of control do not guarantee the uniform clinical performance of the product. Recognising the orphan designation of Mycograb the CHMP considered that taking into account the limitations of the safety database these quality issues do no allow for a positive risk-benefit balance of Mycograb in the sought indication.

## CHMP conclusion on benefit/risk

Having considered the grounds for the re-examination from the applicant, the discussion during the BWP  and  SAG-Anti-infectives  meetings  and  the  CHMP  members'  discussion  during  the  oral explanation, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit/risk for Mycograb in the claimed indication remains negative.

## Grounds for refusal

- The evidence provided was not sufficient to conclude that the manufacturing process and the methods  of  control  will  guarantee  the  uniform  clinical  performance  of  the  product.  In particular:  the  quality  of  the  product  is  not  controlled  in  a  satisfactory  way  with  respect  to aggregates, the refolding of the molecule and the levels of host cell proteins.
- The size of the safety dataset is too limited to alleviate the concerns related to the quality aspects.
