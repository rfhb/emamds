## Patient card

All prescribers of ZYNYZ should be familiar with and inform the patients about the patient card explaining what to do should they experience any symptom of immune-related adverse reactions. The patient card will be provided to each patient treated with retifanlimab.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is needed for patients who are aged 65 years or over (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. There is insufficient data in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min) and no data for patients with end-stage renal disease and therefore no dosing recommendation can be made (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild hepatic impairment. There are insufficient data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment and therefore no dosing recommendations can be made (see section 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of retifanlimab in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years with Merkel cell carcinoma.

## Method of administration

ZYNYZ is for intravenous use. It must be diluted and administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes.

ZYNYZ must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection.

ZYNYZ can only be administered through an intravenous line containing a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein binding polyethersulfone, polyvinylidene fluoride, or cellulose acetate 0.2 micron to 5 micron in-line or add-on filter or 15 micron mesh in-line or add-on filter. Other medicinal products should not be co-administered through the same infusion line.

For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Immune-related adverse reactions

Immune-related adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in patients treated with retifanlimab. Immune-related adverse reactions can occur in any organ or tissue and may affect more than one body system simultaneously. While immune-related adverse reactions usually occur during treatment, symptoms can also manifest after discontinuation. Important immune-related adverse reactions listed in this section are not inclusive of all possible immune-related reactions.

Early identification and management of immune-related adverse reactions is essential to ensure safe use of retifanlimab. Patients should be monitored for symptoms and signs of immune-related adverse reactions. Blood chemistries, including liver tests and thyroid function tests, should be evaluated at start of treatment and periodically during treatment. For suspected immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation including specialty consultation should be ensured to confirm aetiology or exclude other causes.

Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, treatment with retifanlimab should be withheld or permanently discontinued and corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) or other appropriate therapy administered . Upon improvement to Grade ≤ 1, corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued for at least 1 month (see Table 1).

## Immune-related pneumonitis

Immune-related pneumonitis has been reported in patients receiving retifanlimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Suspected pneumonitis should be confirmed with radiographic imaging and other causes excluded. Patients should be managed with retifanlimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids (see Table 1).

## Immune-related colitis

Immune-related colitis has been reported in patients receiving retifanlimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of colitis and managed with retifanlimab treatment modifications, anti-diarrhoeal agents and corticosteroids (see Table 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immune-related hepatitis

Immune-related hepatitis has been reported in patients receiving retifanlimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment as indicated based on clinical evaluation and managed with retifanlimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids (see Table 1). For Grade 1 hepatitis, liver chemistry monitoring should be increased to twice per week until liver chemistry tests return to baseline.

## Immune-related endocrinopathies

Immune-related endocrinopathies, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis and diabetic ketoacidosis have been reported in patients receiving retifanlimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for abnormal thyroid function tests prior to and periodically during treatment and for cortisol, as indicated based on symptoms and/or falling thyroid-stimulating hormone.

## Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism

Immune-related hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (including thyroiditis) have been reported in patients receiving retifanlimab. Immune-related hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (including thyroiditis) should be managed with retifanlimab treatment modifications as recommended in Table 1.

## Hypophysitis

Immune-related hypophysitis has been observed in patients receiving retifanlimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis and managed with retifanlimab treatment modifications, corticosteroids and hormone replacement, as clinically indicated (see Table 1).

## Adrenal insufficiency

Immune-related adrenal insufficiency has been reported in patients receiving retifanlimab. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and managed with corticosteroids and hormone replacement, as clinically indicated (see Table 1).

## Type 1 Diabetes mellitus

Immune-related type 1 diabetes mellitus has been observed in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for hyperglycaemia and signs and symptoms of diabetes as indicated based on clinical evaluation and managed with oral anti-hyperglycaemics or insulin and retifanlimab treatment modifications (see Table 1).

## Immune-related nephritis

Immune-related nephritis has been reported in patients receiving retifanlimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for changes in renal function and managed with retifanlimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids (see section 4.2).

## Immune-related skin reactions

Immune-related skin reactions, such as toxic epidermal necrolysis, have been reported in patients receiving retifanlimab (see section 4.8). Events of Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of skin reactions. Immune-related skin reactions should be managed as recommended in Table 1.

Caution should be used when considering the use of retifanlimab in a patient who has previously experienced a severe or life-threatening skin adverse reaction on prior treatment with other checkpoint inhibitors.

## Other immune-related adverse reactions

Clinically significant, immune-related adverse reactions were reported in patients treated with retifanlimab in clinical studies including: uveitis, arthritis, myositis, demyelinating polyneuropathy (e.g. Guillain Barré syndrome), pancreatitis and myocarditis (see section 4.8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-related adverse reactions and managed with retifanlimab treatment modifications as described in section 4.2.

## Infusion-related reactions

As with any therapeutic protein, retifanlimab can cause infusion-related reactions, some of which may be severe. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Retifanlimab treatment should be interrupted or the rate of infusion slowed or treatment should be permanently discontinued based on severity of reaction and the response to treatment (see section 4.2). Premedication with an antipyretic and/or an antihistamine should be considered for patients who have had previous clinically significant reactions to infusions of therapeutic proteins (see section 4.8).

## Transplant-related adverse reactions

## Solid organ transplant rejection

Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Treatment with retifanlimab may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. The benefit of treatment with retifanlimab versus the risk of possible organ rejection should be considered in these patients.

## Complications of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)

Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1-blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), acute GvHD, chronic GvHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Patients should be closely followed for evidence of transplant-related complications and prompt intervention may be required. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1-blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

## Patients excluded from the clinical programme

Patients with the following status were excluded from the clinical programme: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) baseline performance score ≥ 2; symptomatic central nervous system metastases; prior immunotherapy or autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy with immunosuppressant agents; history of other malignancies within the last 3 years; organ transplant; or active hepatitis infection. Patients with uncontrolled HIV infection (CD4+ count &lt; 300 cells/μL, detectable viral load, or not receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy) were also excluded.

## Sodium content

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted with retifanlimab. Since retifanlimab is cleared from the circulation through catabolism, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are expected.

The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting retifanlimab, except for physiological doses of systemic corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), should be avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of retifanlimab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after starting retifanlimab to treat immune-related adverse reactions (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

Retifanlimab is not expected to be a victim or perpetrator of drug-drug interactions involving drug transporters or CYP enzymes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception

Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with retifanlimab and for at least 4 months after the last dose of retifanlimab.

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of retifanlimab in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with retifanlimab. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-mediated rejection of the developing foetus resulting in foetal death. Therefore, based on its mechanism of action, retifanlimab can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Human IgG4 immunoglobulins are known to cross the placenta; therefore, retifanlimab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. ZYNYZ is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception (see section 5.3).

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether retifanlimab is excreted in human milk. There is insufficient information on the excretion of retifanlimab in animal milk.

Human IgGs are known to be excreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth; which decreases to low concentrations soon afterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded during this short period. For this specific period, a decision should be made whether to discontinue/abstain from retifanlimab therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of therapy to the woman. Afterwards, retifanlimab could be used during breast-feeding if clinically needed.

## Fertility

No clinical data are available on the possible effects of retifanlimab on fertility. Animal reproduction studies to evaluate the effect of retifanlimab on fertility have not been conducted.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

ZYNYZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Because of potential adverse reactions such as fatigue (see section 4.8), patients should be advised to use caution when driving or operating machinery until they are certain that retifanlimab does not adversely affect them.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Immune-related adverse reactions occurred with retifanlimab. Most of these, including severe reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal of retifanlimab (see 'Description of selected adverse reactions' below).

The most common adverse reactions are fatigue (35.4%), rash (18.8%), diarrhoea (18.6%), anaemia (16.2%), pruritus (15.9%), arthralgia (13.3%), constipation (13.3%), nausea (13.3%), pyrexia (13.1%) and decreased appetite (12.6%). Adverse reactions were serious in 11.7% of patients; most serious adverse reactions were immune-related adverse reactions.

ZYNYZ was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8% of patients; most of them were immune-related events.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The safety of retifanlimab has been evaluated in 452 patients with advanced solid malignancies who received the recommended 500 mg every 4 weeks dose, including 107 patients with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced MCC. Median duration of treatment was 5.4 months (range, 1 day

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 27 months). The frequencies included below are based on all reported adverse drug reactions, regardless of the investigator assessment of causality.

These reactions are presented by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common ( ≥ 1/10); common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); very rare (&lt; 1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

In case of overdose, patients must be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, PD-1/PD-L1 (Programmed cell death protein 1/death ligand 1) inhibitors. ATC code: L01FF10

## Mechanism of action

Retifanlimab is an immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) and blocks its interaction with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. Engagement of PD-1 with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed by antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumour cells and/or other cells in the tumour microenvironment, results in inhibition of T-cell function such as proliferation, cytokine secretion and cytotoxic activity. Retifanlimab binds to the PD-1 receptor, blocks interaction with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, and potentiates T-cell activity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Immunogenicity

Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were uncommonly detected. No evidence of ADA impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety was observed.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The efficacy and safety of retifanlimab was studied in the POD1UM-201 study, an open-label, single-arm, multiregional study that enrolled patients with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced MCC who had not received prior systemic therapy for their advanced disease. Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression, severe hepatic or renal impairment, clinically significant cardiac disease, history of organ transplant, or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECO G) performance score (PS) ≥ 2 were ineligible. Patients who were HIVpositive, with an undetectable viral load, a CD4+ count ≥ 300 cells/microliter and receiving antiretroviral therapy were eligible.

Patients received retifanlimab 500 mg every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for a maximum of 2 years. Assessment of efficacy was performed every 8 weeks for the first year of therapy and 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measure of confirmed objective response rate, and duration of response were assessed by an independent central review committee according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1. All ongoing responses were followed for a minimum of 12 months.

A total of 101 patients were analysed for efficacy. The median age of enrolled patients was 71.1 years (range, 38 - 90 years) with 39 (39%) age 75 or older; 67.3% of patients were male, all but one patient were Caucasian and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0 (73.3%) or 1 (26.7%). Thirty-seven percent of patients were reported to have had prior radiotherapy and 68.3% had prior surgery. Ninety percent of patients had metastatic disease. One patient was HIV-positive. The majority of tumour samples tested (72.3%) were positive for Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV).

Efficacy results are summarized in Table 3. The median duration of treatment was 10.3 months (range, 1 day - 24.8 months).

## MCPyV = Merkel cell polyomavirus.

a PD-L1 expression was determined by IHC using Combined Positive Score (CPS) interpretation.

## Elderly population

Of the 101 patients treated with retifanlimab in the efficacy population, 76.2% (77/101) were 65 years or older, and 38.6% (39/101) were 75 years or older. Objective response rates in these age groups were 55.8% (95% CI: 44.1, 67.2) and 48.7% (95% CI: 32.4, 65.2), respectively.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with ZYNYZ in all subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of MCC. See 4.2 for information on paediatric use.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics (PK) of retifanlimab were characterised using a population pharmacokinetics analysis with concentration data collected from 634 patients with various cancers who received retifanlimab doses of 1, 3, 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 375 mg every 3 weeks, or 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 500 mg and 750 mg every 4 weeks. The AUC was dose proportional in the studied dose range. The geometric mean (CV%) of Cmax and AUC at steady state for the recommended 500 mg every 4 weeks dose were 193 mg/L (24.1%) and 2190 day*mg/L (32.4%).

## Distribution

The geometric mean value (CV%) for volume of distribution at steady state is 6.1 L (20.2%).

## Biotransformation

The metabolic route of retifanlimab has not been characterised. Retifanlimab is expected to be catabolised through protein degradation processes.

## Elimination

A geometric mean (CV%) clearance of 0.314 L/day (36%), without accounting for the time-varying part of the clearance, with a half-life of 14.6 days (31.5%) and 18.7 days (28.7%), after first-dose and at steady-state, respectively, were estimated in the population pharmacokinetic analyses.

## Special Populations

The following factors are not expected to have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of retifanlimab: age (range: 18 to 94 years), weight (35 to 133 kg), sex, race, or tumour burden.

## Renal impairment

The effect of renal impairment on the clearance of retifanlimab was evaluated by population pharmacokinetic analyses in patients with mild (n = 277) or moderate (n = 142) renal impairment (eGFR between 89 and 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ; n = 419) compared to patients with normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m 2 ; n = 200). No clinically important differences were found in the clearance of retifanlimab. There are limited data in patients with severe renal impairment (n = 4, lowest eGFR 26.0 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). Retifanlimab has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

The effect of hepatic impairment on the clearance of retifanlimab was evaluated by population pharmacokinetic analyses in patients with mild (n = 78; TB &gt; ULN to 1.5 ULN or AST &gt; ULN) hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal (n = 555; TB and AST ≤ ULN ) hepatic function. No clinically important differences were found in the clearance of retifanlimab. There are limited data in patients with moderate (n = 1; TB between 1.5 and 3.0 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. Retifanlimab has not been studied in patients with severe (TB between 3.0 and 10 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

No findings of toxicological significance were observed in monkeys in studies of up to 13 weeks duration at exposures sufficiently in excess compared to the clinical exposure at the recommended dose of 500 mg retifanlimab every 4 weeks.

No studies have been performed to assess the potential of retifanlimab for carcinogenicity or genotoxicity.

Animal reproduction and development toxicity studies have not been conducted with retifanlimab. A central function of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is to preserve pregnancy by maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the foetus. In murine models of pregnancy, blockade of PD-L1 signaling has been shown to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and to result in an increase in foetal loss; therefore, potential risks of administering retifanlimab during pregnancy include increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. As reported in the literature, there were no malformations related to the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling in the offspring of these animals; however, immune-mediated disorders occurred in PD-1 and PD-L1 knockout mice. Based on its mechanism of action, foetal exposure to retifanlimab may increase the risk of developing immune-mediated disorders or altering the normal immune response.

3. How ZYNYZ is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store ZYNYZ
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What ZYNYZ is and what it is used for

ZYNYZ contains the active substance retifanlimab, a monoclonal antibody (a protein that recognises and attaches to a specific target substance in the body). ZYNYZ helps your immune system fight your cancer.

ZYNYZ is used in adults to treat Merkel cell carcinoma , a rare type of skin cancer . It is given when the cancer has spread or returned and cannot be treated with surgery or radiation.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given ZYNYZ

## You must not be given ZYNYZ if you

- are allergic to retifanlimab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given ZYNYZ if you have:

- an illness where the body's immune system attacks its own cells
- had a solid organ transplant or a bone marrow (stem cell) transplant that used donor stem cells
- lung or breathing problems
- liver or kidney problems
- diabetes

Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms during treatment or if they get worse:

- lung inflammation (pneumonitis) such as breathing difficulties, chest pain or new or worsening cough.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- bowel inflammation (colitis) such as frequent diarrhoea often with blood and/or mucus, more bowel movements than usual, stools that are bloody, black or tarry and severe abdominal pain or tenderness.
- liver inflammation . Symptoms include persistent nausea or vomiting, loss of appetite, pain on the right side of your stomach, eye and/or skin yellowing, drowsiness, dark-coloured urine, bleeding or bruising more easily than normal.
- hormone gland problems (including the pituitary, thyroid and adrenal glands) that may affect how these glands work. Symptoms include fast heartbeat, dizziness, fainting, extreme tiredness, persistent or unusual headaches, weight change, hair loss, feeling cold or constipation.
- type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis . Symptoms of diabetes include feeling more hungry or thirsty than usual, frequent urination, weight loss, feeling tired or sick. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include difficulty thinking clearly, sleepiness, stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, breath that smells sweet or fruity, sweet or metallic taste in the mouth or a different odour to urine or sweat.
- kidney inflammation . Symptoms include decreased volume of urine, foamy urine, passing blood or traces of blood in the urine that may change its colour, swollen ankles or loss of appetite.
- skin problems that can lead to a severe skin reaction known as toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Symptoms include rash, itching, skin blistering or ulcers in the mouth or in the lining of the nose, throat or genital area.
- inflammation in other parts of the body such as eyes (changes in eyesight), joints, muscles, nerves, pancreas (symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting), or of the heart muscle.
- infusion-related reactions such as chills, shaking, rigor, fever, itching, rash, flushing or swollen face, shortness of breath or wheezing, feeling dizzy or faint.

If you have any of the above-mentioned symptoms during treatment, do not try to treat your symptoms with other medicines on your own. Your doctor may:

- give you other medicines to prevent complications and reduce your symptoms,
- monitor you,
- withhold the next dose of ZYNYZ,
- stop your treatment or
- slow or stop your infusion depending on the severity of the reaction, if you have an infusion-related reaction when you receive ZYNYZ.

Please note that the above listed symptoms are sometimes delayed and may occur weeks or months after your last dose.

Complications of solid organ transplant rejection, including graft-versus-host disease, in patients who have received a bone marrow (stem cell) transplant that uses donor stem cells can lead to death. They may occur if you undergo transplantation either before or after treatment with ZYNYZ. Your doctor will monitor you for these complications.

## Children and adolescents

ZYNYZ should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not been studied in this patient group.

## Other medicines and ZYNYZ

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. This applies in particular to medicines that suppress your immune system, such as corticosteroids, which may disrupt the effect of ZYNYZ. Once you are treated with ZYNYZ, your doctor may prescribe corticosteroids to reduce side effects that you may have during treatment. This will not impact the effect of the medicine.

## Contraception

Women who could become pregnant must use effective contraception during treatment and for minimum 4 months after the last ZYNYZ dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy

You must not be given ZYNYZ if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it. ZYNYZ can cause harmful effects or death to your unborn baby. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine.

## Breast-feeding

It is not known if ZYNYZ passes into breast milk. A risk to the breast-feeding newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Ask your doctor for advice if you are breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

ZYNYZ may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If you feel tired, do not drive or use machines until you feel better.

## ZYNYZ contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose unit, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free.' However, before ZYNYZ is given to you, it is mixed with a solution that may contain sodium. Talk to your doctor if you are on a low-salt diet.

## 3. How ZYNYZ is given

ZYNYZ will be given to you in a hospital or clinic, supervised by a doctor experienced in cancer treatment.

The recommended dose of ZYNYZ is 500 mg every 4 weeks.

Your doctor will give you ZYNYZ as a drip into a vein (intravenous infusion) which will last about 30 minutes.

Your doctor will decide how many treatments you need.

## If you miss an appointment to receive ZYNYZ

It is very important that you do not miss a dose of this medicine. Contact your doctor or hospital immediately to reschedule your appointment.

## If you stop receiving ZYNYZ

Stopping your treatment may stop the effect of the medicine. Do not stop treatment with ZYNYZ without the agreement of your doctor.

## Patient card

Important information from this package leaflet can be found in the patient card you have been given by your doctor. It is important that you keep this patient card and show it to your partner or caregivers.

If you have any further questions about your treatment, ask your doctor or nurse.
