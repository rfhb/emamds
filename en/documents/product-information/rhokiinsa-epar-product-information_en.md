## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Rhokiinsa 200 micrograms/ml eye drops, solution.

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each ml of solution contains 200 micrograms netarsudil (as mesylate).

## Excipient(s) with known effect

Each ml of solution contains 150 micrograms benzalkonium chloride.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Eye drops, solution (eye drops).

Clear solution, pH 5 (approximately).

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Rhokiinsa is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment with Rhokiinsa should only be initiated by an ophthalmologist or a healthcare professional qualified in ophthalmology.

## Posology

The recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening. Patients should not instill more than one drop in the affected eye(s) each day.

If one dose is missed, treatment should continue with the next dose in the evening.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Rhokiinsa in children below the age of 18 years have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

For ocular use.

No data on potential interactions specific to netarsudil is currently available (see section 4.5). If netarsudil is to be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic medicinal products, each medicinal product should be administered at least five (5) minutes apart. Due to netarsudil's vasodilating properties, other eye drops should be administered before. Eye ointments should be administered last.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Contact lenses should be removed prior to instillation of netarsudil and may be reinserted 15 minutes following its administration (see section 4.4).

The tip of the dispensing container should avoid contacting the eye, surrounding structures, fingers, or any other surface in order to avoid contamination of the solution. Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated solutions.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Ocular effects

Twice a day dosing is not well tolerated and is not recommended. Netarsudil dosed twice daily provided slightly larger IOP reductions, but had a less favorable safety profile as reflected in a higher rate and increased severity of ocular adverse reactions. Twice a day dosing was also associated with a higher discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions (53.8%) during a 12-month study. It is therefore recommended to dose netarsudil once daily.

## Reticular epithelial corneal oedema

Reticular epithelial corneal oedema (RECE) has been reported following administration of medicinal products containing netarsudil, particularly in patients with preexisting corneal oedema or prior ocular surgery. RECE typically resolves upon discontinuation of the medicinal product containing netarsudil. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they experience decreased vision or eye pain while using Rhokiinsa.

The efficacy of netarsudil has not been studied beyond 12 months.

## Excipients with known effect

## Benzalkonium chloride

This medicinal product contains benzalkonium chloride.

Benzalkonium chloride has been reported to cause eye irritation, symptoms of dry eyes and may affect the tear film and corneal surface and is known to discolour soft contact lenses. It should be used with caution in dry eye patients and in patients where the cornea may be compromised. Patients should be monitored in case of prolonged use.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of netarsudil in pregnant women. No effects during pregnancy are anticipated, since systemic exposure to netarsudil is negligible (see section 5.2). Animal studies with intravenous administration do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity at clinically relevant exposures (see section 5.3). Rhokiinsa should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with netarsudil.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether netarsudil/metabolites are excreted in human milk. However, while no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of breast-feeding women to netarsudil is expected to be negligible, no relevant clinical data are available (see section 5.2). A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Rhokiinsa therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

There are no data on the effects of netarsudil on male or female fertility. However, no effects are anticipated, since systemic exposure to netarsudil is negligible (see section 5.2).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Rhokiinsa has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If transient blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient should wait until the vision clears before driving or using machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials were conjunctival hyperemia (51% of patients), cornea verticillata (17%), instillation site pain (17%), conjunctival haemorrhage (8%), instillation site erythema (8%), corneal staining (7%), blurred vision (6%), increased lacrimation (6%) and erythema of eyelid (5%). Serious adverse reactions were not reported in clinical trials.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The following adverse reactions have been reported with netarsudil, dosed once daily. Reactions are classified according to the convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 000 to &lt;1/100), rare (≥1/10 000 to &lt;1/1 000), very rare (&lt;1/10 000) or not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

2 Additional adverse reaction observed with netarsudil monotherapy

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Conjunctival hyperaemia

Conjunctival hyperaemia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction associated with netarsudil treatment in clinical trials and it is attributed to the vasodilation effect of the Rho kinase inhibitor drug class. Conjunctival hyperaemia was typically mild in severity and sporadic. However, there was a relatively small proportion of subjects with moderate or severe hyperaemia who discontinued treatment because of this adverse reaction (6.0% in Phase 3 clinical trials).

## Cornea verticillata

Cornea verticillata occurred in approximately 20% of the patients in controlled Phase 3 clinical trials. The cornea verticillata seen in netarsudil-treated patients were first noted at 4 weeks of daily dosing. This reaction did not result in any apparent visual functional changes in patients. The majority of cornea verticillata resolved upon discontinuation of treatment. The incidence of cornea verticillata was higher in certain subpopulat ions: elderly (≥65 years) versus non-elderly (24.8 vs. 15.9%); males versus females (24.4 vs. 18.4%) and in white versus other races (25.6 vs. 7.0%).

## Special populations

## Elderly subjects

With the exception of cornea verticillata (see above), no difference in the safety profile for Rhokiinsa has been observed between subjects aged &lt;65 or ≥65 years.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Systemic exposure to netarsudil following topical ocular administration has been shown to be negligible. If topical overdose of netarsudil should occur, the eye(s) may be flushed with tap water. Treatment of an overdose would include supportive and symptomatic therapy.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, antiglaucoma preparations and miotics, ATC code: S01EX05

## Mechanism of action

Netarsudil, a Rho kinase inhibitor, is believed to reduce IOP by increasing outflow of aqueous humor. Studies in animal and man suggest that the main mechanism of action is increased trabecular outflow. These studies also suggest that netarsudil lowers IOP by reducing episcleral venous pressure.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

A randomised, double-blind, multicentre Phase 3 clinical trial compared the efficacy and safety of netarsudil once daily with that of timolol maleate 0.5% twice daily in reducing IOP in a total of 708 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The median age of study participants was 65.5 years (range 18 to 91 years).

The study was designed to show non-inferiority of netarsudil when dosed once daily in the evening to timolol maleate 0.5% dosed twice daily in patients with a baseline IOP of &gt;20 mmHg and &lt;25 mmHg. The primary efficacy outcome measure was mean IOP at each of 9 timepoints measured at 08:00, 10:00 and 16:00 on day 15, day 43 and day 90. The non-inferiority margin applied was a difference in mean IOP ≤1.5 mmHg for all time points over all visits through 3 months and ≤1.0 mmHg at a majority of these time points. The IOP reduction with netarsudil dosed once daily was non-inferior to the effect of timolol 0.5% dosed twice daily in patients with baseline IOP of &lt;25 mmHg (Table 1). Efficacy was also investigated in patients with baseline IOP ≥25 mmHg and &lt;30 mmHg. Netarsudil demonstrated clinically relevant reductions in IOP at all timepoints, however non-inferiority to timolol was not demonstrated in this population with baseline IOP ≥25 mmHg and &lt;30 mmHg (Table 2).

The safety of netarsudil has been evaluated in clinical trials, including four well-controlled Phase 3 studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Approximately 75% of subjects included in the netarsudil treatment groups of Phase 3 studies were Caucasian and 24% Black or African American.  Over half were aged ≥ 65 years.  With the exception of the incidence of cornea verticillata, no other difference in safety profile was observed between races or age groups (see section 4.8).

Completion rates in Phase 3 studies were lower in the netarsudil treatment group when compared with the timolol maleate group. Subjects with known contraindications or hypersensitivity to timolol were excluded from the studies. Discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 19.3% for the netarsudil treatment group versus 1.7% for the timolol maleate group. The majority of discontinuations in the netarsudil group were associated with ocular adverse reactions, whereas the majority of discontinuations in the timolol group were associated with non-ocular adverse reactions. The most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with discontinuation in the Rhokiinsa groups were conjunctival hyperemia (5.8%), cornea verticillata (3.7%) and vision blurred (1.4%). The incidences of hyperemia and vision blurred were sporadic in nature.

The efficacy and safety of netarsudil in subjects with compromised corneal epithelium or co-existing ocular pathologies e.g. pseudoexfoliation and dispersion pigment syndrome has not been established.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Rhokiinsa in all subsets of the paediatric population for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

The systemic exposures of netarsudil and its active metabolite, AR-13503, were evaluated in 18 healthy subjects after topical ocular administration of netarsudil once daily (one drop bilaterally in the morning) for 8 days. There were no quantifiable plasma concentrations of netarsudil (lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) 0.100 ng/ml) post dose on day 1 and day 8. Only one plasma concentration at 0.11 ng/ml for the active metabolite was observed for one subject on day 8 at 8 hours post-dose.

## Biotransformation

After topical ocular dosing, netarsudil is metabolised by esterases in the eye to an active metabolite, AR-13503.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to development. Effects in non-clinical trials were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.

Intravenous administration of netarsudil mesylate to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis did not produce adverse embryofetal effects at clinically relevant systemic exposures. In pregnant rats, 0.3 mg/kg/day (1 000 times the recommended ophthalmic dose) and higher showed increased postimplantation loss and reduced foetal viability.  In pregnant rabbits, 3 mg/kg/day (10 000 times the recommended ophthalmic dose) and higher showed an increase in post-implantation loss and a decrease in foetal weight.

Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of netarsudil.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Netarsudil was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutation assay, in a mouse lymphoma assay, or in a rat micronucleus test.

Netarsudil and its active metabolite AR-13503 was found to have a possible phototoxic potential in a modified 3T3 NRU-PT in vitro assay, where the wavelength was extended to include UVB light.

3. How to use Rhokiinsa
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Rhokiinsa
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Rhokiinsa is and what it is used for

Rhokiinsa contains an active substance called netarsudil. Netarsudil belongs to a group of medicines called 'Rho kinase inhibitors', which work to reduce the amount of fluid inside the eye and so lower its pressure.

Rhokiinsa is used to lower pressure in the eyes in adults who have an eye condition known as glaucoma or who have raised pressure in their eyes. If the pressure in the eye is too high, it can damage your sight.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Rhokiinsa

## Do not use Rhokiinsa:

- -if you are allergic to netarsudil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

- Do not use Rhokiinsa more than once a day, as you may experience more side effects.
- Tell  your  doctor  if  you  experience  decreased  vision  or  eye  pain  during  treatment  with  this medicine. This might be due to a type of swelling of the clear outer layer of the eye (reticular epithelial  corneal  oedema).  This  effect  has  been  reported  following  administration  of  this medicine to the eye in patients with certain risk factors, including previous surgery to the eye. It usually improves following discontinuation of the medicine.

## Children and adolescents

Rhokiinsa should not be used in children and teenagers under 18 years of age as it has only been studied in adults.

## Other medicines and Rhokiinsa

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines (see section 3 'How to use Rhokiinsa').

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Do not use Rhokiinsa if you are pregnant or breastfeeding unless your doctor still recommends it.

## Driving and using machines

Rhokiinsa has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. You may find that your vision is blurred or abnormal just after using Rhokiinsa. Do not drive or use machines until the symptoms are cleared.

## Rhokiinsa contains benzalkonium chloride

This medicine contains approximately 150 micrograms benzalkonium chloride in each ml of solution.

Benzalkonium chloride may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and may change the colour of the contact lenses. You should remove contact lenses before using this medicine and put them back 15 minutes afterwards (see section 3 'How to use Rhokiinsa').

Benzalkonium chloride may also cause eye irritation, especially if you have dry eyes or disorders of the cornea (the clear layer at the front of the eye). If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain in the eye after using this medicine, talk to your doctor.

## 3. How to use Rhokiinsa

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

Only use Rhokiinsa for your eyes (ocular use). Do not swallow or inject.

The recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye or eyes once a day in the evening. Use the medicine at around the same time each day.

Do not use more than one drop in the affected eye(s) once a day.

## How to use

<!-- image -->

- Wash your hands before you start. Contact lenses should be removed prior to instillation of Rhokiinsa (see section 2 'Rhokiinsa contains benzalkonium chloride').
- Do not touch the dropper with your fingers when opening or closing the bottle. It could contaminate the drops.
- Twist off the bottle cap, and lie the cap on a clean surface on its side. Continue to hold the bottle, ensuring that the tip doesn't come into contact with anything.
- Hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and fingers.
- Tilt your head back.
- Pull down your lower eyelid with a clean finger to form a 'pocket' between the eyelid and your eye. The drop will go in here (Picture 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Bring the bottle tip close to the eye. Do this in front of a mirror if it helps.
- Do not touch your eye, eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It could contaminate the drops.
- Gently squeeze the bottle to release one drop of Rhokiinsa into your eye.
- Only put one drop into your eye each time. If a drop misses your eye, try again.
- If you need to use the drops in both eyes , repeat the steps for your other eye while you have the bottle open.
- Put back the bottle cap to close the bottle.

If you are using other eye drops , wait at least five minutes after using them and then use Rhokiinsa last due to netarsudil's vasodilating properties. If you are using eye ointments, these should be used last.

## If you use more Rhokiinsa than you should

Rinse your eye with warm water. Do not put in any more drops until it is time for your next regular dose.

## If you forget to use Rhokiinsa

Continue with the next dose as planned. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

## If you stop using Rhokiinsa

Do not stop using Rhokiinsa without first speaking to your doctor. If you stop using Rhokiinsa the pressure in your eye will not be controlled which could lead to loss of sight.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
