The  application  for  DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM consists only of Module 1 information. As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules are identical to the up-to-date quality, safety and  efficacy  profile  of  Ariclaim  20  mg,  30  mg,  40  mg,  60  mg  hard  gastro-resistant  capsules. Information on the scientific discussions can be found in the Ariclaim CHMP assessment report and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). The approved indication is: DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM is indicated for women for the treatment of moderate to severe Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI), and the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) in adults. 2.2 Quality aspects Since this application is an informed consent of the Ariclaim application, the quality data in support of the DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  quality  data  of  the  Ariclaim  dossier  which  have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 2.3 Non-clinical aspects Since  this  application  is  an  informed  consent  of  the  Ariclaim  application,  the  non-clinical  data  in support  of  the  DULOXETINE  BOEHRINGER  INGELHEIM  20  mg,  30  mg,  40  mg,  60  mg  hard gastro-resistant capsules application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Ariclaim dossier which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 2.4 Clinical aspects Since this application is an informed consent of the Ariclaim application, the clinical data in support of the DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Ariclaim dossier which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). · User Consultation

Consultation  with  target  patient  groups  has  been  requested  by  CHMP  for  the  DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules and is part of a follow up measure.

Considering that consultation with target patient groups is currently being carried out on the package leaflet for Cymbalta (Duloxetine, EU/1/04/296/001-009) and that the package leaflets of Cymbalta and DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM are highly similar, the CHMP agreed that changes that

will be implemented in the Cymbalta package leaflet as a result of the on-going consultation with target patient groups should also be implemented in the package leaflet of DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM.

The pharmacovigilance system for DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM, Edition 4.0 dated 30.07.2007 is associated with the pharmacovigilance system from Eli Lilly and Company, version 2.2. The MAH explained the interactions between Eli Lilly and Company and Boehringer Ingelheim International with regards to the Pharmacovigilance systems and provided the Pharmacovigilance System in place at Boehringer Ingelheim International. Risk Management Plan The MAA submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan The Table Summary of the risk management plan is attached in Appendix 1 of this document. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation Since this application is an informed consent of the Ariclaim application, the CHMP considered that the risk-benefit balance of DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg  hard  gastro-resistant  capsules  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the marketing authorisation for the following indication: DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM is indicated for women for the treatment of moderate to severe Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI), and the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) in adults.
