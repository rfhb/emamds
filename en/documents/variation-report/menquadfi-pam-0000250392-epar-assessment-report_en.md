## 1. Introduction

On 7 February 2025, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for MenQuadfi, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that Study MET55: Immunogenicity and Safety of an Investigational Quadrivalent Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Adults, Adolescents, and Children in India and Healthy Adolescents and Children in the Republic of South Africa is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The formulation of the MenACWY vaccine (MenQuadfi) as solution for injection is approved for the active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and older against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria (N.) meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y (as 10µg polysaccharides each and with 55µg conjugated tetanus toxoid carrier protein).

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- MET55 - Immunogenicity and Safety of an Investigational Quadrivalent Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Adults, Adolescents, and Children in India and Healthy Adolescents and Children in the Republic of South Africa

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

MET55 - Immunogenicity and Safety of an Investigational Quadrivalent Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Adults, Adolescents, and Children in India and Healthy Adolescents and Children in the Republic of South Africa

## Description

This was a Phase 3, modified double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled, step-wise, multi-centre study to compare and describe the immunogenicity and safety of MenACYW conjugate vaccine when administered as a single dose in healthy adults, adolescents, and children in India and a modified double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled, multi-centre study to compare and describe the immunogenicity and safety of MenACYW conjugate vaccine when administered as a single dose in healthy adolescents and children in Republic of South Africa (RSA).

Approximately 1332 healthy adults, adolescents, and children were planned to be assigned into 1 of 3 cohorts (Cohort Ia, Cohort Ib, or Cohort II) and randomised 1:1 to the following 8 groups within those cohorts (a total of 866 planned participants in India and a total of 466 planned participants in RSA) as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cohort Ia (Adults aged 18 to 55 years; 200 participants in India; 1 vaccination):

- Group 1 (MenACYW conjugate vaccine; 100 participants)
- Group 2 (Menactra [Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y and W-135) Polysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur Inc, Swiftwater, PA, USA)]; 100 participants)

Cohort Ib (Adults aged ≥ 56 years; 200 participants in India; 1 vaccination):

- Group 3 (MenACYW conjugate vaccine; 100 participants)
- Group 4 (Quadri Meningo [MenPS A,C,Y &amp; W135]: Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine [Group A, C, Y &amp; W135] [Bio-Med Pvt. Ltd., Uttar Pradesh, India] or any locally available licensed meningococcal vaccine indicated for the participant's age; 100 participants)

Cohort II (healthy children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years; 466 participants in India and 466 in RSA; 1 vaccination):

- Group 5 (MenACYW conjugate vaccine, India; 233 participants)
- Group 6 (Menactra, India; 233 participants)
- Group 7 (MenACYW conjugate vaccine, RSA; 233 participants)
- Group 8 (Menactra, RSA; 233 participants)

The recruitment in ages 2 to 17 years was stratified to ensure an equal distribution into 2 subgroups (2 to 9 years and 10 to 17 years) in both countries. This was done to ensure distribution of participants across the complete age range.

## Outcomes/endpoints

See included table on Objectives and endpoints above.

## Sample size

Calculation of Sample Size:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Approximately 1332 subjects will be enrolled. An estimated 15% drop-out rate (only ages 2 - 17 years) from enrolment will result in approximately 1190 subjects in the per-protocol population available for immunogenicity analyses.

## For the Primary Objective:

With 396 evaluable subjects in the combined group (Gr5 + Gr7) and 396 evaluable subjects in the combined group (Gr6 + Gr8), the study will have 90% power using Farrington and Manning's method to declare the non-inferiority of the combined group (Gr5+ Gr7) versus the combined group (Gr6 + Gr8) based on A, C, Y, W antibodies in adolescents and children aged 2 to 17 years (assuming 15% drop-out rate for each group). The power is calculated with the assumption that the estimate from the investigational group equals that of the control group.

Table 3: Power of the study based on the primary objective of non-inferiority in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years

| Antigen   | Estimated* MenACYW   | Estimated Menactra   | Non-inferiority   | Power'   |

| A         | 76%                  | 76%                  | 10%               | 91%      |
| C         | 94.5%                | 94.5%                | 10%               | >99.9%   |

Note: Evaluable subjects:

Combined group (Gr5 + Gr7) = 396 subjects

Combined group (Gr 6 + Gr8) = 396 subjects

Since the hypothesis needs to be met for all serogroups, no alpha adjustment for multiple comparisons is necessary in these calculations.

* Estimated seroresponses are based on the results of a study (50) conducted in India in subjects aged 2 to 75 years. The estimates were the average of overall rates of 2 age groups (2 to 10 years and 11 to 18 years). Borrow et al. reported that incidence rates vary in RSA by province but are currently low overall (0.36/100 000 in 2014) with the majority of disease caused by MenW, followed by MenB. Approximately 66-77% of disease is caused by MenA, C, Y, or W. Due to any lack of published data from RSA it is assumed that the response in subjects aged 2-17 years will be similar between India and RSA. Additionally, any variability should balance itself out due to the wider age range.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

For India, subjects will be assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts and randomised 1:1 to the groups within those cohorts.

On the day of enrolment , subjects in India (aged 18 to ≥ 56 years) who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and provide consent will be randomly assigned to Group 1 or Group 2 (Cohort 1a: subjects aged 18 to 55 years) or to Group 3 or Group 4 (Cohort 1b: subjects aged ≥ 56 year s).

Cohort II will consist of adolescents and children aged 2 to 17 years from India and RSA. For India, subjects or subject's parent / legally authorised representative (LAR) who sign the recording form and provide consent will be randomly assigned to Group 5 or Group 6.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For RSA, subjects who sign the study Assent Form (for subjects aged 7 - 17 years) and whose parent / LAR signs the informed consent form will be randomly assigned to Group 7 or Group 8.

The recruitment in ages 2 to 17 years will be stratified to ensure an equal distribution into 2 subgroups (2 to 9 years and 10 to 17 years) in both of the countries. This will be done to ensure distribution of subjects across the 2 to 17 year age range.

Site staff will connect to the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system, enter the identification and security information, and confirm a minimal amount of data in response to IRT system prompts. The IRT system will then provide at least the subject number and vaccine dose number. The IRT system will also be used to allocate subjects in the rSBA )serum bactericidal assay using rabbit complement) subset as follows:

- Groups 1 - 4: 50 subjects each
- Groups 5 - 8: 100 subjects each

The full detailed procedures for randomization are described in the Operating Guidelines. If the subject is not eligible to participate in the study, then the information will only be recorded on the subject recruitment log. Subject numbers that are assigned by the IRT system will consist of a string. Subject numbers should not be reassigned for any reason. The randomization codes will be kept securely in the IRT system.

## Statistical Methods

Clinical data will be analysed under the responsibility of the Biostatistics Platform of the Sponsor. A SAP will be written and peer reviewed before any analyses. In accordance with the protocol, the SAP will describe all analyses to be performed by the Sponsor and all the conventions to be taken.

## Hypotheses and Statistical Methods for Primary Objective

Thirty days after the administration of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Menactra, the percentages of subjects who achieve ≥ 1:8 in hSBA titres for meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W in the combined group (Gr 5 + Gr 7) are non-inferior to the corresponding percentages in the combined group (Gr 6 + Gr8)

Null hypothesis (H0): p(G5 + G7) p(G6 + 8) ≤

```
-10%
```

Alternative hypothesis (H1): p(G5 + G7) - p(G6 + G8) &gt; -10%

where p(G5 + G7) and p(G6 + G8) are the percentages of subjects who achieve ≥ 1:8 in hSBA titres in the combined group (G5 + G7) and the combined groups (G6 +G8), respectively.

Each of the serogroups A, C, Y, and W will be tested separately. If the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between the 2 proportions is &gt; -10%, the inferiority assumption will be rejected.

For the 4 non-inferiority hypotheses, the CI of the difference in proportions will be computed using the Wilson score method without continuity correction (48). The overall non-inferiority of this objective will be demonstrated if all 4 individual null hypotheses are rejected.

Hypotheses and Statistical Methods for Secondary Objectives

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No hypotheses will be tested. Descriptive statistics will be presented.

## Statistical Methods

## Immunogenicity

Secondary Objectives 1 and 2:

Descriptive statistics will be provided for the antibody titres against meningococcal serogroups contained in MenACYW conjugate vaccine and Menactra in adults aged 18 to 55 years (Gr1 versus Gr2) or Quadri Meningo (or any locally available licensed meningococcal vaccine) in adults aged ≥ 56 years (Gr3 versus Gr4) in India.

## Secondary Objectives 3, 4, and 5:

Descriptive statistics will be provided for the antibody titres against meningococcal serogroups contained in MenACYW conjugate vaccine and Menactra in adolescents and children aged 2 to 17 years in India and RSA combined ([Gr5 + Gr7] versus [Gr6 + Gr8]), India only (Gr5 versus Gr6), and RSA only (Gr7 versus Gr8).

In general, categorical variables in Cohorts Ia and Ib (in India) and II (in India and RSA) will be summarised and presented by frequency counts, percentages, and CIs. The 95% CIs of point estimates will be calculated using the normal approximation for quantitative data and the exact binomial distribution (Clopper-Pearson method) (49) for percentages.

Descriptive analyses on A, C, Y, and W serogroups on D0 and D30 (+14 days) using hSBA and rSBA (in a subset) a will be generated as follows:

Descriptive analyses of hSBA include but will not be limited to:

- Geometric mean titres (GMT) and 95% confidence interval (CI)
- Titre distribution and reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs)
- Percentage of subjects with titre ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8 and 95% CI
- Percentage of subjects with titre ≥ 4 -fold rise from pre-vaccination to post-vaccination, and 95% CI
- Percentage of subjects with hSBA vaccine seroresponse and 95% CI

## Safety

The Safety Analysis Set (SafAS) is defined as those subjects who have received at least 1 dose of the study vaccine and have any safety data available. All subjects will have their safety analyded according to the vaccine they actually received. Safety data recorded for a vaccine received out of the protocol design will be excluded from the analysis (and listed separately). Safety analyses will include but not be limited to the following:

- The number and percentage of subjects reporting any solicited injection site reactions and solicited systemic reactions occurring from D0 to D07 after vaccination will be summarised by study group for intensity, time of onset period, days of occurrence, and action taken
- Immediate unsolicited systemic AEs within 30 minutes and unsolicited AEs occurring up to D30 after vaccination will be summarised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The number and percentage of subjects reporting any unsolicited non-serious AEs will be summarised by study group, intensity, time of onset period, duration, and by MedDRA preferred term and system organ class (SOC), as well as by relationship to the study vaccine
- The number and percentage of subjects reporting at least one of any SAEs will be summarised by study group, seriousness criterion, outcome, and by MedDRA preferred term and SOC, as well as by relationship to the study vaccine
- The number and percentage of subjects reporting at least one of any AESIs will be summarised throughout the study
- Exact (Clopper-Pearson) (49) 2-sided 95% CIs will be calculated for the percentages For exploratory purpose, main safety and immunogenicity parameters may be presented according to baseline HIV status in Groups 7 and 8. Further details will be included in the SAP.

## Analysis Sets

Three analysis sets will be used: the Full Analysis Set (FAS), the Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS), and the SafAS.

## Efficacy results

## Primary Immunogenicity Objective

The primary objective was to demonstrate the NI of hSBA antibody seroprotection (ie, percentages of participants who achieve ≥ 1:8 in hSBA titres) against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W following the administration of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (Group 5 [India] + Group 7 [RSA]) compared to Menactra (Group 6 [India] + Group 8 [RSA]) in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years (Cohort II).

## Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives

For all secondary immunogenicity objectives, only data from the PPAS are presented. As the differences between each PPAS and each full analysis set (FAS) were not greater than 10% for any secondary immunogenicity objective, the analyses were not produced in the FAS. Described below are the results from hSBA analyses. For secondary objectives 1 through 5, a subset of participants with blood samples available were also tested for meningococcal antibody responses as measured by rSBA.

Secondary Objective #1 : To describe the antibody titres to the meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W before and at D30 (+14 days) after vaccination with MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Menactra in adults aged 18 to 55 years in India (Cohort I).

## Vaccine Seroresponse

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For participants with any pre-vaccination titres, the vaccine seroresponse rates correspond to the percentages of participants with a ≥ 4 -fold rise in hSBA titres from D0 to D30. For participants with pre-vaccination titre &lt; 1:8, the percentages of participants with a vaccine seroresponse (ie, with postvaccination titre ≥ 1:16) were higher in Groups 5 + 7 than in Groups 6 + 8, respectively, for each serogroup, except serogroup A for which there was no significant difference between pooled groups.

## Discontinuations due to Adverse Events

There were no discontinuation from the study due to AEs in any group.

## Serious Adverse Events (SAE) Including Deaths

No deaths were reported during the study in any group of Cohort I (India).

During the study, 1 participant (1.0% [1/98]) in Group 1 (India) experienced an SAE that occurred within 30 days of vaccination. There were no SAEs reported in Group 2 (India), Group 3 (India), and Group 4 (India). The SAE reported in Group 1 was COVID-19. The event was considered as not related to the vaccine by the Investigator and the Sponsor. The participant was hospitalised and recovered with medication.

No deaths were reported during the study in any group of Cohort II (India and RSA).

During the study, 1 participant (0.4% [1/232]) in Group 5 (India) experienced an SAE that occurred within 30 days of vaccination. There were no SAEs reported in Group 6 (India), Group 7 (RSA), and Group 8 (RSA). The SAE reported in Group 5 was dengue fever. The event was not considered as related to the vaccine by the Investigator and the Sponsor. The participant was hospitalised and recovered with medication.

## Adverse Events of Special Interest

No AESIs were reported during the study in any group of either Cohort I or Cohort II.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The MAH has completed a double-blind, randomised, parallel-group clinical phase 3 study in healthy adults from India (Cohort I) and children and adolescents from India and the RSA (Cohort II). The adult Cohort I was further divided in participants aged 18-55 years vaccinated either with Menquadfi (Group 1) or with Menactra (Group 2) and participants aged ≥56 years vaccinated either with Menquadfi (Group 3) or Quadri Meningo (Group 4; each group planned with n=100 subjects). The paediatric Cohort II was aged 2 to 17 years and vaccinated either with Menquadfi (Group 5 from India and Group 7 from the RSA) or Menactra (Group 6 from India and Group 8 from the RSA; each group planned with n=233 subjects). This subdivision in paediatric and adult participants as well as the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

stratification of paediatric subjects in 2 subgroups 2 to 9 years and 10 to 17 years in both countries is acknowledged. The focus of this P46 procedure is the paediatric population, but the adult population will also be discussed briefly. The primary objective to demonstrate non-inferiority of the hSBA antibody titre s ≥1:8 for serogroups A, C, Y and W in paediatric subjects after vaccination with Menquadfi compared to vaccination with Menactra is considered not ideal, as baseline titre levels are not taken into account for this measure. Still, the objective can be acceptable as it is complemented by data on seroresponse (i.e. for a pre-vaccination titre &lt; 1:8, the post-vaccination titre must be ≥ 1:16, for a pre-vaccination titre ≥ 1:8, the post -vaccination titre must be at least 4-fold greater than the pre-vaccination titre) and GMTs as secondary objectives. It is critically noted that the primary as well as all secondary endpoints do not specify any success criterion for the comparison of hSBA titre s ≥1:8 between vaccination. The intention to demonstrate non-inferiority for the primary measure can be taken only from the primary objective, secondary objectives and endpoints seem target a more descriptive role without clear comparison and success criterion. Considering the rather positive results on immunogenicity as described below, no concern is raised in this regard. In any case, also for the adult population the presentation of seroresponse is considered the most informative measure regarding the effect of vaccination, complemented by seroprotection and GMTs.

The number of randomised subjects fits to the planned number (only Group 1 with n=98 as well as Groups 5 and 8 with n=232 have very slightly less subjects randomised) and the vast majority of participants completed the study after the final Day 30 visit (99.5% for the combined Cohort I and 96.7% for the combined Cohort II). Protocol deviations seem to have occurred a bit more frequently in the RSA compared to India (in &gt;12% and ~5% of participants, respectively), but seem mostly independent of treatment and not based on a specific concern. No pattern of concern is evident form the reported baseline demographics of either Cohort. Notably, in Cohort I the male/female ratio was &gt;2, but comparable in all groups of that Cohort.

Less than 5% of subjects were HIV-positive in the RSA, which objects a reasonable interpretation of results on immunogenicity and safety. Thus, the decision by the MAH not to produce results for this subgroup can be followed.

## Immunogenicity

The primary endpoint (or better the comparison/success criterion as specified in the primary objective, i.e. non-inferiority in the proportion of participants with titre s ≥1:8 compared to Menactra ) was met as in the two paediatric study groups vaccinated with Menquadfi (Groups 5 and 7) had a numerically higher proportion of subjects with seroprotection levels (hSBA titre levels ≥1:8) compared to the study groups vaccinated with Menquadfi for all serogroups and within both geographical locations (i.e. Groups 5 vs. 6 and 7 vs. 8). Results were comparable in both geographical regions. The numerically higher antibody titres 30 days after vaccination with Menquadfi compared to Menactra was also shown with GMTs and also seroresponse was shown to be higher after vaccination with Menquadfi for all serogroups and in both regions. No critical difference was observed for the immunoresponse in paediatric participants from India and the RSA and the pattern between vaccination groups were comparable in the two subpopulations of paediatric patients 2-9 years and 10-17 years of age.

GMTs of all serogroups were also numerically higher for the adult population when vaccinated with Menquadfi compared to Menactra (aged 18-55 years, Groups 1 vs. 2) or Quadri Meningo (≥56 years, Groups 3 vs. 4). The same  trend was also demonstrated for the proportion of subjects with seroresponse 30 days after vaccination. However, the proportion of subjects with titre s ≥1:8 was higher after Menquadfi vaccination for serogroups C, Y and W, whereas for serogroup A the proportion was numerically slightly higher after the comparator vaccines (overlapping CIs).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results on immunogenicity presented based on rSBA titres showed a comparable pattern between study groups as the results presented for hSBA titres.

## Safety

Only one subject of the study had an immediate AE reported in Cohort I (dizziness postural in Group 1), no paediatric subject reported an immediate reaction with 30 minutes after vaccination.

Solicited local reactions were reported substantially more frequently in paediatric patients from the RSA compared to India. Injection site erythema and swelling were reported by 11-17% of participants in the RSA, but &lt;0.5% of those in India. No critical differences are evident between study groups of the same location (Groups 5 vs. 6 and 7 vs. 8). Injection site pain was reported in India by around 10% more subjects after vaccination with Menquadfi (22.9%) compared to Menactra (12.7%), but by a generally higher proportion in the RSA without evident differences between vaccination groups (37.4% and 36.9% of subjects vaccinated with Menquadfi and Menactra, respectively). Of note, different reporting habits across geographical regions are not uncommon. Injection site pain is a recognised very common adverse reaction upon vaccination with Menquadfi (see SmPC).

A comparable pattern (substantially higher proportions of subjects reporting events in the RSA compared to India, without critical differences between treatment groups, and slightly higher proportions with event in India after vaccination with Menquadfi compared to Menactra) is also seen for solicited systemic reactions headache, malaise and myalgia. However, the pattern appears different for fever, which was reported as solicited reaction most frequently by Indian adolescents after vaccination with Menquadfi (15.5% vs. 5.7% after Menactra (non-overlapping CIs) and 3.5% after Menquadfi and 2.7% after Menactra in the RSA, respectively). Fever was also reported as grade 3 event only after vaccination with Menquadfi (0.4% in India and 0.9% in the RSA, in total 3 paediatric participants), but in all cases the event has resolved, either spontaneously or with medication. Fever is a recognised common adverse reaction upon vaccination with Menquadfi (see SmPC). Other grade 3 reactions were reported only in the RSA, without concerning imbalance between groups (headache in 2.2% and 1.8% as well as myalgia in 0.4% and 1.8% of subjects in Groups 7 and 8, respectively).

Unsolicited AEs within 30 days after vaccination were reported slightly more frequently after Menactra compared to Menquadfi, but CIs are largely overlapping within each geographical location (i.e. between Groups 5 vs. 6 and 7 vs. 8). Again, subjects in the RSA appear to have a higher reporting frequency compared to India (around factor 2-3). However, no SOC or PT stands out as specific risk in the RSA and no unexpected and/or concerning pattern of events seems evident.

One serious AE of dengue fever was reported for a paediatric subject in group 5, but no other serious event was reported for paediatric participants in India or the RSA. A relation to study treatment seems not evident for the event. No death , AESI or discontinuation due to an AE were reported.

No major imbalances are evident between study groups vaccinated with Menquadfi or the comparator vaccine in the adult Cohort 1 (Groups 1 vs. 2 and 3 vs. 4). Solicited reactions (local and systemic) seem more frequent in the adult population &lt;55 years compared to the population &gt;55 years of age after administration of Menquadfi (Groups 1 with 32.7% vs. 3 with 17% of participants with event). Notably, within this study Cohort unsolicited events within 30 days were most frequent for participants &lt;55 years of age after administration of Menquadfi (Group 1, 7.1% of subjects) compared to all other treatment groups in the Cohort (1% in all other Groups).  However, no specific SOC or PT stands out, that would raise concern. One serious event of Covid-19 was reported for one subject in Group 1. The proposed evaluation that this event is not directly related to the study vaccine can be followed. No discontinuation, no AESI and no death was reported for the adult population of the study.

## 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

The primary immunogenicity endpoint was met and the general pattern on immunogenicity results indicates numerically higher titre levels upon vaccination with Menquadfi compared to the respective comparator vaccines in paediatric and adult study participants. Substantial differences in the reporting of safety events are evident between the two geographical locations of the paediatric investigation. In general, a higher proportion of participants in the RSA have reported safety events compared to participants in India, but independent of study vaccine. Different reporting habits across geographical regions are not uncommon. Only fever, as known common adverse reaction of Menquadfi, was most frequently reported by children in India after vaccination with Menquadfi compared to all other vaccination groups of the paediatric Cohort II. However, no critical safety finding stands out for the adult (Cohort I) or paediatric (Cohort II) study population after vaccination with Menquadfi.
