## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

Adults and children from 6 months of age

| Age group             | Dose                      | Schedule                        |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 6 months to < 9 years | One or two a 0.5 mL doses | If 2 doses, administer at least |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

|                          |                 | 4 weeks apart   |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 9 years of age and older | One 0.5 mL dose | Not applicable  |

## Children below 6 months of age

The safety and efficacy of Flucelvax in children from birth to less than 6 months of age has not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

## For intramuscular injection only.

The preferred site for injection is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Young children with insufficient deltoid mass should be vaccinated in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh.

The vaccine must not be injected intravenously, subcutaneously or intradermally and must not be mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe.

For instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to possible trace residues such as beta-propiolactone, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and polysorbate 80.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in patients with acute febrile illness until the fever is resolved.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

As with all injectable vaccines, Flucelvax must be administered with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration.

## Anxiety-related reactions

Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints.

## Immunocompromised patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient to prevent influenza.

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients.

## Excipients with known effect

## Sodium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodiumfree'.

## Potassium

This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'potassium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Based on clinical experience Flucelvax can be given at the same time as other vaccines.

If Flucelvax is to be used at the same time as another vaccine, it should be administered at separate injection sites and preferably on different limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified by any co-administration.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

Data derived from cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Flucelvax Tetra) are relevant to the trivalent Flucelvax vaccine because both vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.

## Pregnancy

Inactivated influenza vaccines, such as Flucelvax, can be given in any stage of pregnancy. Larger safety datasets are available on vaccine use during the second or third trimester, compared with the first trimester, however data from worldwide use of influenza vaccines do no indicate any adverse foetal and maternal outcomes attributable to the vaccine.

A prospective Pregnancy Exposure Registry was conducted in the United States (US) and data were collected from 665 women vaccinated with cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine during 3 Northern Hemisphere influenza seasons (2017-18 to 2019-20), of whom 28% were exposed during their first trimester. Based on pregnancy outcomes and predefined infant safety outcomes, there was no evidence of adverse foetal, newborn or pregnancy outcomes attributable to the vaccine during any stage of pregnancy.

Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether Flucelvax is excreted in human milk. No effects on breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Flucelvax may be given during lactation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility

No human fertility data are available. Animal data have not shown effects on female fertility. Male fertility has not been assessed in animals.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Flucelvax has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

Data for cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine are relevant to Flucelvax because both vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.

## Summary of the safety profile

Safety in adults 18 years and older was evaluated in a randomised, controlled study (V130\\_01), in which 1 334 subjects received cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine or one of two formulations of cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (N=1 346). (see section 5.1)  Similar rates of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were reported in subjects who received cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine and cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine comparator in this clinical study.

The most commonly reported (≥10%) reactions in subjects who received cell -based quadrivalent influenza vaccine or the trivalent comparators were pain at the injection site (34%), headache (14%), fatigue (16%), erythema (13%), myalgia (12%),  and induration (10%).

The incidence of some adverse reactions were considerably lower among subjects ≥ 65 years of age when compared to subjects 18 to &lt; 65 years of age (see table below).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency categories: Very common (≥1/10); Common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); Uncommon (≥1/1 000 to &lt;1/100), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Paediatric population (6 months to less than 18 years of age)

Safety in children 6 months to less than 18 years of age has been evaluated in three clinical studies, V130\\_03,  V130\\_12 and V130\\_14 (N=7 443). In Study V130\\_03, children 4 to less than 18 years of age received a cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (N=1 159) or one of two formulations of cellbased trivalent comparators (N=1 173) (see section 5.1). In Study V130\\_12 children 2 to less than 18 years of age received a cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (N=2 255) or a non-influenza comparator vaccine. In study V130\\_14, children 6 months to less than 4 years received a cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine or a non-influenza comparator vaccine (N=2 856). In these studies, children 6 months to less than 9 years of age received one or two doses (separated by 28 days) of cellbased quadrivalent influenza vaccine based on determination of the subject's prior influenza vaccination history.

The most common local and systemic adverse reactions reported for cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine or the trivalent comparator in any of the three studies are described below by paediatric subgroup.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

T he most common (≥10%) local and systemic adverse reactions after any vaccination in children 6 to less than 18 years of age were pain at the injection site (61%), injection site erythema (25%), injection site induration (19%), fatigue (18%), headache (22%) myalgia (16%), injection site ecchymosis (11%) and loss of appetite (11%).

The most common (≥10%) local and systemic adverse reactions after any vaccination in children 6 months to less than 6 years of age were tenderness at the injection site (54%), injection site erythema (23%), sleepiness (21%), irritability (21%), injection site induration (15%), change in eating habits (16%), diarrhoea (13%), injection site ecchymosis (11%) and fever (11%).

Similar rates of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were reported in subjects who received cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine and cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine comparator (Study V130\\_03).

Compared to adults 18 years of age and older, paediatric subjects generally reported higher rates of local and systemic adverse reactions.

In children who received a second dose of cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine or the trivalent comparator the incidence of adverse reactions following the second dose of vaccine was similar or slightly lower to that observed with the first dose.

The highest frequency of adverse reactions in children 6 months to less and 18 years of age in these clinical studies are described in Table 2 below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There are no data for overdose with Flucelvax. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, influenza vaccine, ATC code: J07BB02

## Mechanism of action

Flucelvax provides active immunisation against the influenza virus strains contained in the vaccine. Flucelvax induces humoral antibodies against the haemagglutinins. These antibodies neutralise influenza viruses.

Specific levels of haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres post-vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine have not been correlated with protection from influenza virus. In some human studies, antibody titres of 1:40 or greater have been associated with protection from influenza illness in up to 50% of subjects.

Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibody to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype.

Annual revaccination with current influenza vaccines is recommended because immunity declines during the year after vaccination and circulating strains of influenza virus may change from year to year.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Clinical efficacy of Flucelvax against culture-confirmed influenza in adults

A multinational, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study (V58P13) was performed to assess clinical efficacy and safety of Flucelvax during the 2007-2008 influenza season in adults aged 18 to less than 50 years. A total of 11 404 subjects were enrolled to receive Flucelvax (N = 3 828), egg-based trivalent influenza vaccine (N = 3 676) or placebo (N = 3 900) in a 1:1:1 ratio.

Flucelvax efficacy was defined as the prevention of culture-confirmed symptomatic influenza illness caused by viruses antigenically matched to those in the vaccine compared to placebo. Influenza cases were identified by active and passive surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI). ILI was defined according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition, i.e., a fever (oral temperature ≥ 100.0°F / 38°C) and cough or sore throat. After an episode of ILI, nose and throat swab samples were collected for analysis. Vaccine efficacies against vaccine-matched influenza viral

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

strains, against all influenza viral strains, and against individual influenza viral subtypes were calculated (Table 3).

Data for cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine are relevant to Flucelvax because both vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions

Immunogenicity in Adults 18 years of age and older

Immunogenicity was evaluated in adults 18 years of age and older in a randomised, doubleblind, controlled study (V130\\_01). In this study, subjects received cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (N = 1 334) or one of the two formulations of comparator cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine with either the same strain  composition as Flucelvax, TIV1c (N=677), or an alternate B strain, TIV2c (N = 669). The immune response to each of the vaccine antigens was assessed, 21 days after vaccination.

The immunogenicity endpoints were geometric mean antibody titres (GMTs) of haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies response and percentage of subjects who achieved seroconversions, defined as a prevaccination HI titre of &lt;1:10 with a post vaccination titre ≥1:40 or with a pre -vaccination HI titre of ≥10 and a minimum 4 -fold increase in serum HI antibody titre.

Immunogenicity data  are summarised in Table 4.

## Paediatric population

Clinical efficacy of cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine in the paediatric population 6 months to less than 18 years of age

Absolute efficacy of cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine was evaluated in children 2 to less than 18 years of age in Study V130\\_12, and in children 6 to less than 48 months, in Study V130\\_14. Study V130\\_12  was a multinational, randomised, non-influenza vaccine comparator-controlled efficacy study conducted in 8 countries over 3 influenza seasons, in which 4 514 subjects were enrolled to received 0.5 ml of cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine or a non-influenza comparator vaccine (meningococcal ACYW-135 conjugate) in a 1:1 ratio. Based on influenza vaccination history, participants received one or two doses (28 days apart) of the study vaccine.

Cell-based  quadrivalent  influenza  vaccine  efficacy  was  assessed  by  the  prevention  of  confirmed influenza illness caused by any influenza Type A or B strain.  Influenza cases were identified by active surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) and confirmed by viral culture and/or real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR).  An ILI episode was defined as a fever body temperature ≥ 37.8°C) along with at least one of the following: cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, or rhinorrhoea. Vaccine efficacy against laboratory confirmed influenza was calculated (Table 5).

1 Number of subjects in the Full-Analysis Set (FAS)- Efficacy, which included all subjects randomised, received a study vaccination and provided efficacy data.

Efficacy in children 6 months to less than 4 years was evaluated in Study V130\\_14. This was a multinational, randomised, observer-blind, non-influenza vaccine comparator-controlled efficacy study conducted in 15 countries over 5 influenza seasons, in which 5 697 subjects received either 0.5 ml of cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine or a non-influenza comparator in a 1:1 ratio. Based on influenza vaccination history, participants received one or two doses (28 days apart) of the study vaccine.

Cell-based  quadrivalent  influenza  vaccine  efficacy  was  assessed  by  the  prevention  of  confirmed influenza illness caused by any influenza Type A or B strain. Influenza cases were identified by active surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) and confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) and viral culture . An ILI episode was defined as a fever body temperature ≥ 37.8°C with at least one of the following on the same day: cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, earache or ear discharge.

## Immunogenicity in Children and Adolescents 4 to less than 18 Years of Age

Immunogenicity of cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine was evaluated in children 4 to less than 18 years of age as part of a randomised, double-blind, controlled study (V130\\_03). In this study, subjects received cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (N = 1 159) or one of the two formulations of comparator cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine with either the same strain composition as Flucelvax, TIV1c (N = 593), or an alternate B strain, TIV2c (N = 580). The immune response to each of the vaccine antigens was assessed 21 days after vaccination.

The immunogenicity endpoints were GMTs of HI antibodies response and percentage of subjects who achieved seroconversions (seroconversion rate), defined as a pre-vaccination HI titre of &lt;1:10 with a postvaccination titre ≥1:40 or with a pre -vaccination HI titre ≥ 1:10 and a minimum 4 -fold increase in serum HI antibody titre.

The immunogenicity data in subjects 4 to less than 18 years of age are summarised in Table 7.

3. How Flucelvax is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Flucelvax
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Flucelvax is and what it is used for

Flucelvax is a vaccine against flu (influenza). Flucelvax is prepared in cell cultures, and, therefore, is egg-free.

When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defence system) will produce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu.

Flucelvax is used to prevent flu in adults and children from 6 months of age.

The vaccine targets three strains of influenza virus following the recommendations by the World Health Organisation for the 2025/2026 Season.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive Flucelvax

## You should not receive Flucelvax:

If you are allergic to:

- the active ingredients or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
- beta-propiolactone, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, or polysorbate 80, which are trace residues from the manufacturing process.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Flucelvax.

## BEFORE receiving the vaccine

- Your doctor or nurse will make sure that appropriate medical treatment and supervision is readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction (a very severe allergic reaction with symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, dizziness, a weak and rapid pulse and skin rash) following the administration. This reaction may occur with Flucelvax as with all vaccines that are injected.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- You should tell your doctor if you have an acute illness associated with fever. Your doctor may decide to delay your vaccination until your fever is gone.
- You should tell your doctor if your immune system is impaired, or if you are undergoing treatment which affects the immune system, e.g. with medicine against cancer (chemotherapy) or corticosteroid medicines (see section 'Other medicines and Flucelvax').
- You should tell your doctor if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily.
- Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection, therefore tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection.

As with all vaccines, Flucelvax may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated.

## Children aged less than 6 months

This vaccine is currently not recommended in children aged less than 6 months as safety and efficacy in this age group have not been established.

## Other medicines and Flucelvax

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or if you have recently received any other vaccine.

Flucelvax may be given at the same time as other vaccines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

## Pregnancy

Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. Influenza vaccines may be given in any trimester of pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

Use of Flucelvax during breast-feeding has not been studied. No effects on breast fed babies are expected. Flucelvax  may be given during breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

Flucelvax has no or negligible effect on your ability to drive and use machines.

## Flucelvax contains sodium chloride and potassium chloride

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'potassium-free'.

## 3. How Flucelvax is given

Flucelvax is given to you by your doctor or nurse as an injection into the muscle at the top of the upper arm (deltoid muscle) or into the muscle of the upper and outer part of the thigh in young children depending on the muscle size.

## Adults and children from 6 months of age:

## One dose of 0.5 ml

If your child is younger than 9 years of age and has not been previously vaccinated against flu, a second dose should be given after at least 4 weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The following side effects have been reported during clinical studies and during general use:

## Very serious side effects
