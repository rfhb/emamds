## I. INTRODUCTION

On  28  October  2011,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  submitted  the  following  completed paediatric  trial  for  Prevenar  13  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as amended,  on  medicinal  products  for  paediatric  use:  Wyeth  Study  6096A1-3010-US  (Pfizer  Study B1851009) entitled, 'A Phase 3, Open-Label, Single-Arm Trial Evaluating the Safety, Immunogenicity, and Impact of 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Alaskan Native Children.' The study was also a Post Marketing Commitment (FUM 017).

On 19 January 2012, the CHMP adopted the following conclusions:

Study  6096A1-3010  was  undertaken  with  the  primary  objective  to  assess  the  impact  of 13vPnC on the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in the Yukon Kuskokwinm delta region due to the 13 vaccine S pneumoniae serotypes. Furthermore, it was included in the  Risk  Management  Plan  (RMP)  to  address  the  'missing  information'  safety  concern  of 'safety of more than 4 doses of CRM-based pneumococcal vaccine.'

A significant failure of the study was that enrolment was limited to only 373 subjects, 182 of which completed all of the planned vaccinations within the protocol.... No direct sample size calculations were performed regarding the primary objective of the study; however, at the initiation of the study, it was estimated that approximately 2500 subjects would be enrolled. Given the rather small sample size, it is uncertain whether any meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the data obtained.

The CHMP also requested the following clarification:

The MAH  should  discuss the adequacy  of the study to fulfill its obligation as a pharmacovigilance  activity  in  the  RMP.  In  addition,  the  MAH  should  discuss  what  other sources may be accessed to address the missing information of 'safety of more than 4 doses of CRM-based pneumococcal vaccine.'

## II. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

Study 3010 was not designed specifically to evaluate the safety of more than 4 doses of CRM-based pneumococcal vaccine. However, the study design did offer the opportunity to collect data that could contribute to a better understanding of this issue. It is for this reason that Study 3010 is mentioned in the RMP as addressing the safety of more than 4 doses: the mention was made for completeness of information and was not meant to indicate that the study would be able to provide a comprehensive evaluation of this issue.

Other  studies  that  provide  information  regarding  the  safety  of  more  than  4  doses  of  CRM-based pneumococcal vaccines include Study 6096A1-3011 and Study 6096A1-3021.

## Study 6096A1-3011

Study 3011 was a Phase 3 open-label trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 13vPnC in children aged 15 months to 17 years.

Submission of this study report was also a Post Marketing Commitment. (FU2 18.1).

The following reports relating to this study were previously submitted to the European Authorities:

- .
- -mo follow up for cohort 1) in December 2010.

Assessment Reports were received for both submissions (EMEA/H/C/1104 FUM 18, AR; and EMEA/H/C/1104 FU2 018.2, AR).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  study  enrolled  subjects  in  4  age  groups,  2  of  which  provide  data  relevant  to  the  present discussion. Group 1 enrolled subjects &gt;15 months to &lt;2 years of age who had previously received at least 3 doses of marketed 7vPnC, and group 2 enrolled subjects &gt;2 years to &lt;5 years of age who had received at least 3 doses of 7vPnC. Subjects in group 1 were to receive

2 doses of 13vPnC given at least 56 days apart, while subjects in group 2 were to receive 1 study dose of 13vPnC.

Study 3011 was originally designed to enroll 125 subjects in group 1 and 182 subjects in group 2. However,  after  the  requisite  numbers  of  subjects  were  enrolled  in  these  groups,  the  protocol  was amended to increase the sample size of each age group to 300. Subjects enrolled in Groups 1 and 2 before this amendment were identified as cohort 1, while those enrolled after the amendment were identified as cohort 2; data were analyzed separately for the two cohorts.

Safety  results  for  this  study  were  summarized  for  all  subjects  by  group  and  cohort.  In  addition, exploratory analyses were performed for subgroups of subjects according to the number of previous doses  of  7vPnC  they  had  received.  Separate  reactogenicity  and  adverse  event  summaries  were produced for each subgroup; however, because the number of previous doses was not controlled in the study design, no formal statistical within-group comparisons were performed for number of previous doses received.

Table 1 provides an overview of the number of subjects enrolled in each subgroup. As can be seen from the table, across both cohorts, a total of 82 (37+45) subjects in group 1 had received 3 previous doses of 7vPnC and could potentially have received a fourth and fifth dose of CRM-based pneumococcal conjugate (PnC) vaccine during the study. Similarly, a total of 220 (89+131) subjects in group 1 had received  4  previous  doses  of  7vPnC  and  could  potentially  have  received  a  fifth  and  a  sixth  dose  of CRM-based vaccine. Finally, across both cohorts, a total of 277 (172+105) subjects in group 2 had received 4 previous doses of 7vPnC and would have received a fifth dose of CRM-based vaccine during the  study.  Thus,  overall,  a  total  of  579  subjects  in  this  study  were  available  to  provide  information regarding the safety of &gt;4 doses of CRM-based pneumococcal vaccine.

Table 2. Number of Subjects Enrolled in Subgroups by Number of Previous Doses of 7vPnC - Study 6096A1-3011

| NumberofPrevious   | Cohort1   | Cohort1   | Cohort2   | Cohort2   |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Dosesof 7vPnC      | Group 1   | Group 2   | Group 1   | Group 2   |
| 3                  | 37        |           | 45        |           |
| 4                  | 89        | 172       | 131       | 105       |

Safety was evaluated based on information regarding local reactions, systemic events, and adverse events experienced after each study vaccination. The summaries of data by group and cohort, as well as the results from the subgroup analyses revealed no safety signals of concern. In these children &gt;15 months to &lt;5 years of age, the incidence and severity of local reactions and systemic events after a fourth, fifth,  or  sixth  dose  of  CRM-based  PnC  vaccine  were  similar to  those observed in infants and young children who received up to 4 doses of 13vPnC in clinical studies of 13vPnC. Overall, the safety profile of 13vPnC remains unchanged. Complete results of the subgroup analyses are reported in the clinical study report (CSR) for Study 3011 (cohort 1) and in the CSR addendum (cohort 2).

## Study 6096A1-3021

Study 3021 was an open-label trial that was designed to evaluate the concentration of antibodies to the 13vPnC vaccine serotypes among children who had received one of 3 regimens of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in study 6096A1-008: 4 doses of 13vPnC, 4 doses of 7vPnC, or 3 infant doses of 7vPnC  followed  by  1  toddler  dose  of  13vPnC  (7vPnC/13vPnC).  Study  3021  also  evaluated  the immunogenicity and safety of a single dose of 13vPnC administered to these children &gt;24 months after the toddler dose in study 008.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study 6096A1-3021 was a Post Marketing Commitment (FUM) and the full study report was submitted in  June  2011.  A  CHMP  opinion  was  adopted  in  August  2011.  The  opinion  requested the information from the study be included in the European SPC and this amendment was submitted as Variation II41 which received a CHMP positive opinion in February 2012.

A  total  of  258  subjects  received  a  single  dose  of  13vPnC  in  study  3021,  which  for  all  subjects represented a fifth dose of CRM-based pneumococcal vaccine. All subjects were between 3 and 4 years of age (mean age = 3.4 years) at the time of vaccination in this study. Safety data were summarized for all subjects vaccinated in the study, and were also summarized by treatment regimen in study 008: 130 subjects had received 4 doses of 13vPnC, 64 subjects had received 4 doses of 7vPnC, and 64 subjects had received 7vPnC/13vPnC in that study.

Safety was evaluated based on information regarding local reactions, systemic events, and adverse events. Overall, the results revealed no safety signals. In these children 3 to 4 years of age receiving a fifth dose of PnC vaccine, the incidence and severity of local reactions, systemic events, and adverse events were similar to those observed in infants and young children who received up to 4 doses of 13vPnC in previous studies of 13vPnC. Overall, the observations made in this study do not alter the safety profile of 13vPnC. Complete results for study 3021 are reported in the clinical study report.

## III. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

Included in the RMP for Prevenar 13 was the safety concern of 'missing information' related to 'safety of more than 4 doses of CRM-based pneumococcal conjugate vaccine' for which Study 6096A1-3010 was noted as the pharmacovigilance activity to address this piece of missing information.  At the time of assessment of the CSR, it was noted that only 137 subjects who were potentially exposed to more than 4 doses of such vaccine given the failure of the study to complete the projected enrolment.

The MAH has now summarized data from 2 additional studies with relevant data for the safety concern. Studies 6096A1-3011 and 6096A1-3021 supply data for an additional 579 + 258 subjects.  The total number  of  subjects  receiving  more  than  4  dose  of  CRM-based  vaccine  therefore  approaches  1000. This  total  includes  infants  and  children  up  to  5  years  of  age.    No  specific  safety  concerns  were identified during the 3 separate analyses which have been assessed in different procedures.

The further discussion by the MAH is appreciated, and this procedure is considered complete.
