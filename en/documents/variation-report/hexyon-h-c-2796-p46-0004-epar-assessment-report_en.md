## Introduction

On 11 March 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study A3L28 for Hexaxim/ Hexacima/ Hexyon, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk balance for Hexaxim™/Hexacima™/Hexyon™ and that no consequential regulatory action is required.

## Scientific discussion

## Information on the development program

The MAH stated that A3L28 'Evaluation of Antibody Persistence at 3.5 and 4.5 Years of Age in Healthy Children After Primary Series and Booster Vaccination with Investigational (DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T) or Infanrix™ hexa vaccines in Latin America' is a standalone study.

This study is the immunogenicity follow-up of two previously assessed studies: A3L24 and A3L27.

## Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

No vaccines were given in this extension study A3L28. In the original studies A3L24 and A3L27 commercial products of Prevenar, Rotarix and Infanrix hexa were given.

## Clinical aspects

## Introduction

Hexaxim™/Hexacima™/Hexyon™ is indicated for active immunisation (primary and booster vaccination) of infants and toddlers from six weeks to 24 months of age against diphtheria (D), tetanus (T), pertussis, Hepatitis B (Hep B), poliomyelitis and invasive diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib).

The MAH submitted the final report for:

## A3L28:

'Evaluation of Antibody Persistence at 3.5 and 4.5 Years of Age in Healthy Children After Primary Series and Booster Vaccination with Investigational (DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T) or Infanrix™ hexa vaccines in Latin America'

This clinical study A3L28 is a Phase III long-term antibody persistence study and was conducted in Colombia with a maximum of 699 children who completed a 3-dose primary series (DTaPIPV-Hep BPRP-T or Infanrix™ hexa), concomitantly administered with Prevenar™ (PCV7) (3 doses) and Rotarix™ (2 doses) in study A3L24, and the booster (DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T or Infanrix™ hexa, concomitantly administered with Prevenar™ [PCV7]) in study A3L27. All subjects received also hepatitis B vaccination at birth.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This study was not conducted as part of the EU-approved Paediatric Investigational Plan for this product (EMEA 001201-PIP01-11-M02).

## Clinical study

## Description

Primary immunization (Hexacim or Infanrix hexa both concomitantly given with Prevenar and Rotarix) had been done in study A3L24, the booster dose (Hexacim or Infanrix hexa both with Prevenar) was given in study A3L27. Subjects now in this study kept the subject number from A3L27 and no further vaccinations were given.  Blood draws were now made at the age of 3.5y and the second at the age of 4.5y (each +/- 60 days), i.e. ~2 and 3 years post booster vaccination. SAEs from A3L27 were followed and collected as well as newly developed SAEs during this trial.

## Methods

## Study design

Only subjects from Colombia participated in this follow-up study.

The following distribution per group was expected based on the groups of the booster study A3L27.

- Group 1: maximum of 264 children who received 3 doses of DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine at 2, 4, 6 months of age (MoA) concomitantly with PCV7 and Rotarix™ (2 doses at 2 and 4 MoA), and a booster dose of DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine concomitantly with PCV7 at 12 to 24 MoA.
- Group 2: maximum of 264 children who received 3 doses of DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine at 2, 4, 6 MoA concomitantly with PCV7 and Rotarix™ (2 doses at 2 and 4 MoA), and a booster dose of Infanrix™ hexa vaccine concomitantly with PCV7 at 12 to 24 MoA.
- Group 3: maximum of 171 children who received 3 doses of Infanrix™ hexa vaccine at 2, 4, 6 MoA concomitantly with PCV7 and Rotarix™ (2 doses at 2 and 4 MoA), and a booster dose of DTaP-IPV-HBHib vaccine concomitantly with PCV7 at 12 to 24 MoA.

## Objective(s)

## Primary:

To describe the long-term antibody (Ab) persistence at 3.5 and 4.5 years of age following a 3-dose primary series vaccination of either DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib+Prevenar™ (PCV7)+Rotarix™ or Infanrix™ hexa+Prevenar™ (PCV7)+Rotarix™ vaccination at 2, 4, 6 months of age and a booster vaccination of DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib+Prevenar™ (PCV7) or Infanrix™ hexa+Prevenar™ (PCV7) at 12 to 24 months of age. Only 2 doses of Rotarix™ were administered in the primary series at 2 and 4 months of age.

## Observational:

To describe the long-term Ab persistence by group and by stratification on the age at inclusion of the A3L27 booster study.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary:

The following serological endpoints were assessed in children aged 3.5 years (months [M]18 to M30 post-booster dose) and 4.5 years of age (M30 to M42 post-booster dose) according to the groups assigned in A3L27 study:

- Ab concentrations/titers for each valence (except PCV7 and Rotarix™ valences)
- Ab concentrations/titers above a cut-off:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o Anti-D Ab concentrations ≥ 0.01 IU/mL, ≥ 0.1 IU/mL and ≥ 1.0 IU/mL
- o Anti-T Ab concentrations ≥ 0.01 IU/mL, ≥ 0.1 IU/mL and ≥ 1.0 IU/mL
- o Anti-Hep B Ab concentrations ≥ 10 mIU/mL and ≥ 100 mIU/mL
- o Anti-PRP Ab concentrations ≥ 0.15 μ g/mL and ≥ 1.0 μ g/mL
- o Anti-pertussis toxin (PT) and anti-filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) Ab concentrations ≥ LLOQ* (Lower Limit of Quantitation), ≥ 2x LLOQ and ≥ 4x LLOQ
- o Anti-poliovirus 1, 2, and 3 Ab titers ≥ 8 (1/dil)

(* LLOQ = 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] units [EU]/mL for PT and FHA)

## Observational:

The following serological endpoints were assessed in children aged 3.5 years (months [M]18 to M30 post-booster dose) and 4.5 years of age (M30 to M42 post-booster dose):

- Ab concentrations/titers for each valence (except PCV7 and Rotarix™ valences)
- Ab concentrations/titers above a cut-off:
- o Anti-D Ab concentrations ≥ 0.01 IU/mL, ≥ 0.1 IU/mL and ≥ 1.0 IU/mL
- o Anti-T Ab concentrations ≥ 0.01 IU/mL, ≥ 0.1 IU/mL and ≥ 1.0 IU/mL
- o Anti-Hep B Ab concentrations ≥ 10 mIU/mL and ≥ 100 mIU/mL
- o Anti-PRP Ab concentrations ≥ 0.15 μ g/mL and ≥ 1.0 μ g/mL
- o Anti-PT and anti-FHA Ab concentrations ≥ LLOQ, ≥ 2x LLOQ and ≥ 4x LLOQ
- o Anti-poliovirus 1, 2, and 3 Ab titers ≥ 8 (1/dil)

## Statistical Methods

For the main objective:

The analysis was descriptive according to the group subjects were assigned to in the A3L27 booster trial. Immunogenicity endpoints were described at 3.5 and 4.5 years of age on all available blood samples.

The following parameters were used:

- Geometric mean (GM) of Ab concentrations/titers
- Percentage of subjects with concentrations/titers above predefined thresholds, including those of predefined seroprotection

95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated:

- using the exact binomial method (Clopper-Pearson method) for single proportions
- using the normal approximation of the Log10 titers, followed by a back transformation for geometric mean concentrations/titers (GMCs/GMTs)

Reverse cumulative distribution curves for each Ab criterion are presented.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Additionally for each Ab criterion, kinetic curves based on GMC or GMT at each time point were plotted including the primary series, booster, and long-term time points.

For the observational objective:

Descriptive statistics are produced.

Immunogenicity endpoints are additionally presented by vaccine group and age stratum based on the age at inclusion in the A3L27 booster phase study. The stratification on the age is as follows: 12 months included till 15 months excluded (simplified as [12 months, 15 months[), [15 months, 19 months[ and [19 months, 24 months].

The same statistical method as the one described for the main objective was used.

N: Number of subjects analyzed according to Immunogenicity Analysis Set

n: number of subjects

M: number of subjects available for the endpoint

%: percentages and 95% CIs are calculated according to the subjects available for the endpoint

LLOQ value for anti-PT and anti-FHA is 2 EU/mL

Year 1 (V01) and Year 2 (V02) are the first and second time points of follow-up that correspond to the follow-up when subjects were aged, respectively, 3.5 and 4.5 years, both time points following a 3dose primary series vaccination of either DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine or Infanrix™ hexa at 2, 4, and 6 MoA (both concomitantly administered with PCV7 at 2, 4, and 6 MoA, and Rotarix™ at 2 and 4 MoA), and a booster vaccination of DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine or Infanrix™ hexa at 12 to 24 MoA (both concomitantly administered with PCV7).

The GMTs and GMCs of antibodies against all antigens except Polio were similar in all three groups. For Polio the group primed with Infanrix hexa showed significantly higher titres than the Hexaxim primed groups. Details can be found in Table 5 and Figure 5.

Considering that the booster dose was given at some time point between 12 and 24 months of age an analysis was also done for the different age increments (12-15m, 15-19m, 19-24m) but the results still show a high similarity between groups (with the same exceptions described above) and the expected higher titres/concentrations in the older subgroups.

## Safety results

No deaths or other SAEs were reported. The safety profile remains unchanged.

## Discussion on clinical aspects

The data provided show the titres and concentrations including antibody kinetics 2-3 years following the booster dose of Hexyon versus Infanrix hexa with priming Hexyon versus Infanrix hexa and concomitantly used vaccines.

The seroprotection levels of antibodies against Diphtheria, Tetanus, HepB and Polio are adequate and similar to what is known from other vaccines.

The titres and concentrations of antibodies against all antigens vary only for IPV and Pertussis depending on which vaccine has been used for priming (IPV) or for priming and/or booster. For IPV the Infanrix hexa primed subjects show statistically significantly higher concentrations; the general antibody kinetic is identical nevertheless. For the Pertussis antigens slightly higher titres can be found in the Hexyon primed groups.  The scale of all those differences is not clinically relevant for the timeframe of 3 to 4 years after primary immunization with Hexaxim so this is just an observation and not an issue for the moment. Nevertheless, the company should continue to monitor the long-term antibody values in the EU studies.

The safety profile remains unchanged as no SAEs or even deaths occurred during the 2 years of this study.
