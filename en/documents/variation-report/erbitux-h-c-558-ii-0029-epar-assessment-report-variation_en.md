## I. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1 Introduction

Cetuximab  is  a  chimeric  monoclonal  IgG1  antibody  directed  against  the  epidermal  growth  factor receptor  (EGFR). EGFR signalling pathways are involved in the control of cell survival, cell cycle progression,  angiogenesis,  cell  migration  and  cellular  invasion/metastasis.  Cetuximab  binds  to  the EGFR  with  an  affinity  higher  than  that  of  endogenous  ligands.  Cetuximab  blocks  binding  of endogenous  EGFR  ligands  resulting  in  inhibition  of  the  function  of  the  receptor  and  induces  the internalization  of  EGFR,  which  can  lead  to  down-regulation  of  EGFR.  Cetuximab  also  targets cytotoxic  immune  effector  cells  towards EGFR-expressing  tumour  cells  (antibody  dependent  cellmediated cytotoxicity, ADCC).

Erbitux  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR)expressing, KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with chemotherapy

as a single agent in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based therapy, and who are intolerant to irinotecan.

For the indication squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN) approval was granted initially in September 2006 followed by an indication enlargement in November 2008:

Erbitux is indicated for the treatment of patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck in combination with radiation therapy for locally advanced disease

in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for recurrent and/or metastatic disease.

Erbitux is administered intravenously weekly.

This is an application for an indication in NSCLC originally proposed as: Erbitux is indicated for firstline treatment of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy.

## 1.2 Clinical aspects

Altogether four randomised studies in chemotherapy naïve patients with NSCLC have been submitted in support of the proposed new indication.

## 1.2.1 Clinical efficacy

## Main studies

## EMR 62 202-046

Open, randomized, multicenter phase III study comparing cisplatin + vinorelbine plus cetuximab vs. cisplatin + vinorelbine as first-line treatment for subjects with EGFR-expressing, advanced non-smallcell lung cancer (NSCLC).

## Main Inclusion Criteria:

- Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC: stage IIIb with documented malignant pleural effusion, or stage IV.
- Immunohistochemical evidence of EGFR expression on tumour tissue.
- At least 1 bidimensionally measurable index lesion (not in previously irradiated area).
- ECOG PS of ≤ 2 at study entry.
- Adequate renal, liver and bone marrow function.

## Study Treatment and Duration:

- Cetuximab (initial dose 400 mg/m²; subsequent weekly doses 250 mg/m²)

3-weekly cycles of CTX: cisplatin (80 mg/m² on Day 1) + vinorelbine (25 mg/m² on Days 1 and 8).

## or

- Cisplatin + vinorelbine alone at the same dosages.

CTX was given for a maximum of 6 cycles in case of at least stable disease with discretionary continuation of cetuximab as monotherapy in subjects who had received cetuximab.

The randomization was stratified by ECOG PS of 0-1, versus 2, and disease stage IIIb with pleural effusion versus IV.

Tumour response and progression was assessed at study sites.

There were three amendments, the most important being that the starting vinorelbine dose was decreased from 30 mg/m² to 25 mg/m² due to the high incidence of neutropenia and neutropenic fever of any grade (49% and 21%, respectively, pooled analysis of 365 subjects for the DSMB). At that point in time 747 subjects had signed the second informed consent. Subjects who had already started with 30 mg/m² before the amendment remained on 30 mg/m² if the investigator considered that the subject benefited from and tolerated this dose.

More subjects in the CTX group went off study without image-based PD and were therefore censored (cetuximab + CTX: 18%; CTX: 24%). The time to treatment failure was therefore calculated as a post hoc  sensitivity  analysis,  also  taking  into  account  events  which  were  considered  signs  of  clinical progression (non-image-proven PD and start of any new anticancer treatment).

## Study CA225099

A randomized, open label, multicenter phase III study of taxane + carboplatin + cetuximab vs. taxane + carboplatin as first-line treatment for subjects with advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

## Main Inclusion Criteria:

- Men and women, age ≥ 18 years.
- Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC, stage IV or stage IIIb with documented malignant pleural effusion, or recurrent disease following radiotherapy or surgical resection.
- Bidimensionally measurable disease; if the only measurable tumor was in previously irradiated area, it had to be regarded as new after completion of radiotherapy.
- ECOG PS of 0 or 1 at study entry.
- Adequate renal, liver and bone marrow function.

## Study Treatment and Duration:

- Cetuximab (initial dose 400 mg/m²; subsequent weekly doses 250 mg/m²)
+ 3-weekly cycles of CTX, i.e. paclitaxel (225 mg/m² on Day 1) or docetaxel (75 mg/m² on Day 1)
+ carboplatin (AUC 6).

or

- Paclitaxel or docetaxel + carboplatin alone at the same dosages.

CTX  was  given  for  a  maximum  of  6  cycles  in  case  of  at  least  stable  disease  with  discretionary continuation of cetuximab as monotherapy in subjects who had received cetuximab.

Subjects who met eligibility criteria were randomized (phone) in a 1:1 ratio to either C/T/C or T/C. The  investigator  specified  which  taxane  the  subject  would  receive,  either  paclitaxel  or  docetaxel. Randomization  was  stratified  by  PS  (0  or  1),  investigational  site,  and  intended  on-study  taxane (paclitaxel  or  docetaxel)  and  was  carried  out  using  the  Pocock  and  Simon  dynamic  balancing algorithm.

The primary analyses of PFS and tumour response endpoints were based on IRRC assessments.

There were four protocol amendments. Amendment 3 (11-Nov-2005) changed the primary endpoint from response rate to PFS and increased the sample size from 300 to 660.

Duration of chemotherapy treatment was limited to 6 cycles in studies EMR 62 202-046, CA225099, and CA225100, and to 8 cycles in study EMR 62 202-011. In each of the 4 randomized, controlled studies the dose intensity of chemotherapy was reasonably comparable between the cetuximab + CTX group and the CTX alone group, but a tendency towards more dose-reductions was seen in the add-on arms in study CA225009 as illustrated below.

N=mumber of subjects

Subjects in the cetuximab + CTX groups who discontinued chemotherapy could continue on cetuximab monotherapy if they did not have progressive disease. A total of 399/979 (40.8%) subjects received cetuximab monotherapy. The median numbers of cetuximab monotherapy infusions in the individual studies ranged from 6 to 11.

## Adverse events

The AE profile of cetuximab is considered well-known:

- Infusion-related Reactions (IRRs). Mild or moderate IRRs are very common and occur in a close temporal relationship mainly to the first cetuximab infusion. Severe IRRs may occur, in rare cases with fatal outcome. They usually develop during and up to 1 hour after the end of the initial cetuximab infusion, but may occur after several hours or with subsequent infusions. Some of these reactions may be anaphylactoid/anaphylactic in nature.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Skin reactions may develop in more than 80% of patients and mainly present as acnelike rash and/or, less frequently, as pruritus, dry skin, desquamation, hypertrichosis, or nail disorders. Approximately 15% of skin reactions are severe, including single cases of skin necrosis. The majority of skin reactions develop within the first 3 weeks of therapy.
- Very common side effects ( ≥ 10% patients): hypomagnesemia, increase in liver enzyme levels, mucositis (mild to moderate that may lead to epistaxis).
- Common side effects ( ≥ 1% to &lt;10% patients): headache, conjunctivitis, diarrhoea, dehydration, hypocalcemia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia that may lead to weight decrease.
- Uncommon side effects ( ≥ 0.1% to &lt;1% patients): blepharitis, keratitis, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis.

## Grade 3 or 4 AEs

As expected, CTX-related events dominated in the add-on studies. This is illustrated by data on grade 3 or 4 AEs occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects or grade 4 AEs occurring in ≥ 1% of subjects in either treatment group in Study EMR 62 202-046 (add-on to cisplatin + vinorelbine)

Frequencies  of  neutropenia  reported  by  the  investigator  as  AEs  were  similar  between  treatment groups,  but  neutropenia  findings  based  on  laboratory  values  differed.  Frequencies  of  laboratory assessments of neutropenia were higher than those based on AEs, and grade 3 or 4 / grade 4 laboratory values were generally more common in the cetuximab + CTX groups than in the CTX control groups.

The frequency of grade 4 neutropenia was higher in studies EMR 62 202-046 and -011 than in studies CA225099  and  CA225100.  However,  laboratory  evaluations  were  performed  more  frequently  in studies EMR 62 202-046 and -011.

## 1.3 Pharmacovigilance/Risk management plan

A new version of the RMP was submitted with this application taking into account the results of the submitted studies.

## 1.4 Overall Discussion and SAG- Oncology outcome

Platinum-based  doublets  have  for  long  been  considered  standard  therapy  in  patients  with  advanced NSCLC.  Recently,  however,  bevacizumab  was  licensed  as  add-on  therapy  in  patients  with  nonsquamous NSCLC. Bevacizumab is the only targeted therapy that has been approved in combination with CTX for the first-line treatment of non-squamous cell NSCLC. At the time of approval (end of 2007) a statistically significant prolongation of the most relevant endpoint OS time for NSCLC was reported  for  the  combination  of  15  mg/kg  bevacizumab  with  carboplatin  +  paclitaxel  (HR  0.79, difference in median OS of 2 months).

It  is  agreed  that  progress in the treatment of NSCLC is slow. In non-squamous NSCLC the HR for ciplatin  +  pemetrexed  vs.  cisplatin  +  gemcitabine  was  0.84,  for  example.  Similarly  the  HR  for  the comparison cisplatin + docetaxel vs. cisplatin + vinorelbine was 0.85 and only borderline statistically significant.

Recently, data presented at the ESMO meeting in September 2008 showed that the addition of 7.5 or 15 mg/kg bevacizumab to cisplatin + gemcitabine did not result in a statistically significant survival benefit (HR 0.93 for 7.5 mg/kg and 1.03 for 15 mg/kg bevacizumab, differences in median 0.5 and 0.3 months, respectively).

Large confirmatory studies have been conducted with erlotinib and gefitinib (EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors) as add-on to platinum based regimens without any discernable add-on activity.

Cetuximab  as  add-on  to  standard  chemotherapies  in  the  treatment  of  advanced  NSCLC  has demonstrated to increase tumour response rates. This increase appears unrelated to KRAS mutation status,  even  though  data  are  limited.  This  implies  that  the  activity  may  be  unrelated  to  EGFR signalling and could be due to e.g. ADCC. Seemingly higher activity in squamous cell carcinoma in the two main studies would also indicate that EGFR signalling may not be the main target for activity. EGFR  expression,  as  estimated  by  IHC  or  FISH,  may  not  be  of  importance  for  the  activity  of cetuximab.

In the largest study a statistically borderline add-on activity in terms of survival was shown. The addon benefit, however, is modest (HR 0.87, corresponding to about 5 weeks median difference), but it is acknowledged  that  next-line  therapies,  including  use  of  TK  inhibitors,  might  dilute  the  apparent treatment effect. Comparable HR:s for OS have been reported in the other studies submitted in support of the application. Pooled analyses using different methodologies indicate that the HR is about 0.88 corresponding to a median difference of slightly more than 1 month at a p-value of 0.01.

Add-on activity in terms of prolonged PFS has been less convincingly demonstrated from a statistical perspective. The HR of 0.9 corresponds to an estimated median difference of 0.5 months.

The tolerability/toxicity profile of cetuximab is considered relatively well characterised also as add-on to various chemotherapy regimens. Very common and common adverse reactions of importance for the tolerability encompass skin reactions, diarrhoea, mucositis, nausea, fatigue, etc. Less common, but severe  and  serious  reactions  include  neutropenic  fever,  thromboembolic  complications,  dehydration and severe infusion related reactions.

In all 4 studies, the combined frequencies of subjects with SAEs and grade 4 AEs in all 4 randomized controlled  studies  were  56.8%  (556/979)  and  48.6%  (476/979)  for  cetuximab  +  CTX  and  41.3% (409/991)  and  40.6%  (402/991)  for  CTX  alone  resulting  in  a  difference  of  15.5%  and  8.0%, respectively.

In the presented trials the estimated benefit of add-on cetuximab to standard chemotherapy in terms of survival  is  considered  modest  (HR  0.88)  and  statistically  non-compelling  in  the  light  of  nonconvincing  effects  in  terms  of  PFS.  Documented  benefits  are  not  considered  to  outweigh  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tolerability  and  safety  concerns,  including  an  increased  risk  for  grade  4  AE:s  and  SAE:s  in  studies CA225099 and EMR 62202-046. Benefit - risk is thus considered unfavourable.

The CHMP decided to consult the SAG- Oncology group on the following questions.

1. Cetuximab shows a modest add-on activity to platinum-based therapies in the treatment of NSCLC. This activity appears not to be affected by KRAS mutation status and the activity profile also differs from what has been seen with small molecule EGFR-TK inhibitors. This could imply that blockage of EGFR-signalling is not of major importance for the activity of cetuximab in this setting. Antibody mediated cytotoxicity would be a possible mechanistic explanation.  Does  the  SAG  foresee  ways  forward  to  identify  patients  with  increased likelihood of response to cetuximab?

The SAG acknowledged that a substantial effort has been made to identify important clinical and biological markers to select likely responders to treatment with cetuximab+chemotherapy. Despite such  effort,  no  reliable  markers  could  be  found.  Adequate  samples  were  only  available  in  a variable subset of patients, less than 30% for certain analyses, and the outcome in terms of overall survival  (OS)  for  such  subsets  was  not  always  comparable  to  the  overall  population.  Thus, selection bias in the analysis presented may have contributed to this. The SAG agreed that further analyses  of  the available samples,  if possible, as well  as additional studies are  strongly recommended. Ideally samples should prospectively be saved for broader drug target screens; e.g. gene expression profiling with repeated sampling for intrapatient analysis. With modern standards cytological  samples  should  give  sufficient  material.  The  rapid  development  of  (c)DNA  based sequencing strategies  may  also  give  important  more  global  insights  into  the  genetic  alterations, including those pathways already examined.

The SAG also agreed that based on the exploratory analyses presented, histology did not seem to be a convincing predictor for selecting responders.

2. The add-on activity in terms of PFS and OS is modest. Is the benefit considered to outweigh the tolerability and toxicity profile of add-on cetuximab?

The SAG agreed that OS, progression-free survival (PFS) health-related quality of life (HRQL) and  toxicity  are  important  clinical  endpoints,  and  that  favourable  effects  need  to  be  balanced against the unfavourable ones, particularly grade 3-4 toxicity, treatment-related deaths, and need for hospitalisation.

Concerning OS, a statistically significant effect was observed in the larger pivotal trial EMR 62 202-046 ('FLEX') where OS was the primary endpoint and in the pooled analyses of all included studies,  but  not  in  exploratory  analyses  of  trial  CA225099  ('099')  where  this  was  studied  as  a secondary  endpoint. Concerning  the  clinical significance of the  effect  on  OS,  the  SAG acknowledged  that  the  statistical  significance  might  primarily  be  due  to  the  high  number  of patients enrolled (&gt; 2000) and followed until death, that the improvement in median OS was about 1  month  (+/-  12  vs  11  months),  that  it  was  consistent  across  studies,  but  transient  and  that  the magnitude of the effect was at best of very modest clinical significance.

Concerning  PFS,  no  statistically  significant  effect  was  observed  in  study  099  (where  this  was studied as a primary endpoint) and no convincing effect was shown in exploratory analyses of the FLEX study, but PFS was statistically significant in the pooled analyses of all included studies. Based on conventional estimates, the effect, if any, was considered clinically very marginal.

Concerning HRQL, a summary of the main results was verbally presented by the holder of the marketing  authorisation.  It  was  claimed  that  HRQL  analyses  were  importantly  hampered  by missing data but that no clinically relevant detriment in HRQL  was associated with cetuximab+chemotherapy  compared  to  chemotherapy  alone  in  longitudinal  analyses.  Some worsening in the HRQL for certain domains, such as the social functioning around cycle 3, was claimed to be associated with skin toxicity. As always, the major problem is the lack of predefined domains being the primary end-point, making any conclusions questionable based on HRQL.

Concerning  toxicity,  the  SAG  agreed  that  cetuximab+chemotherapy  was  associated  with  an increase in toxicity compared to chemotherapy alone, particularly about 10% increase in grade 3

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

skin toxicity (skin toxicity grade 1 or more, however, may be associated with a better outcomeretrospective observation), and about 6% increase in febrile neutropenia in the FLEX study, or a 4.2% and 1.1% in grade 3/4 and grade 4 febrile neutropenia, respectively, increase in the pooled safety population analysis presented. The marketing authorisation holder claimed that the number of hospitalisations due to febrile neutropenia was similar between treatment arms. There was an about 11% increase in serious adverse events in the pooled population. No data were presented about need for hospitalisation regardless of cause.

Concerning  the  balance  of  benefits  and  risks,  the  SAG  members  were  split  into  two  slightly different views:

- a. According to one view, the very modest benefit observed did not outweigh the risks due to the observed  toxicity  profile.  From  a  clinical  perspective,  the  tradeoffs  in  terms  of  the  risks observed should be at least in the order of 2-3 months improvement in median OS, and this should  be  based  on  convincing  clinical  data,  including  supportive  data  on  PFS  and  other clinically relevant endpoints. According to this view, the lack of a clearly consistent effect in PFS was difficult to explain and may suggest that the effect on OS could be due to treatment given after progression.
- b. According to another view, although very modest in absolute terms, the effect on OS cannot be ignored, it is a very relevant effect in relative terms due to the short survival, and is similar to incremental improvement achieved with other agents in NSCLC. The added toxicity was of some concern but it was considered manageable and in the overall balance did not outweigh the benefits in a condition where there are only few treatments with an effect on OS. The lack of convincing supportive data in terms of PFS was considered not to be critical because the overall pattern was generally consistent with OS in terms of a favourable treatment effect.

## 2. Possibility to identify patients with increased likelihood of response to cetuximab

As requested by the CHMP, the MAH made efforts to identify retrospectively subgroups of patients where the benefit of cetuximab treatment would be more pronounced.

## 2.1. Biomarker analyses

Following  the  CHMP  request  and  the  presentation  to  the  SAG,  the  MAH  submitted  results  form biomarker analyses. With the exception of EGFR staining in study EMR 62 202-046, neither phase III study  had  other  biomarker  analyses  prospectively  planned  in  the  original  protocol.  However,  for exploratory  analyses,  substantial  efforts  were  made  to  collect,  retrospectively,  as  much  archived tumour tissue as possible from patients in the two studies.

The results of the analyses were discussed at the SAG meeting. The rationale governing the selection of biomarkers was acknowledged, but the problems associated with low percentages of samples for analyses  were  also  emphasized.  Due  to  this  and  the  overall  low  add-on  activity  of  cetuximab  only major differential activity would be detected. The lead hypotheses based on external but not NSCLC related  data,  i.e.  that  KRAS  mutation  status  would  be  of  importance,  however,  can  reasonably  be regarded  as  refuted.  With  respect  to  KRAS,  similar  results  have  also  been  reported  for  erlotinib administered  after  chemotherapy  first  line  NSCLC,  i.e.  that  KRAS  mutations  seem  not  to  be associated with major loss in efficacy (study SATURN).

Available  biomarker  data  have  been  presented  and  analysed  and  that  there  is  agreement  that  these analyses  provide  no  basis  for  selecting  patients  for  treatment  with  cetuximab.  In  case  of  a  positive opinion, the company's plans to address this issue should be further detailed. It is obvious, however, that additional clinical studies are needed.

## 2. 2. Further subgroup analyses of Study EMR 62 202-046 ('FLEX').

Study EMR 62 202-046 ('FLEX') was conducted worldwide. As today Asians are known to present with NSCLC biologically different from NSCLC in Caucasian, this study was further analysed.

|                                 | Asian (n=121)     | Caucasian (n=946)   |
|---------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Adenocarcinoma                  | 72%               | 44%                 |
| Female                          | 46%               | 27%                 |
| Never-smoker                    | 52%               | 17%                 |
| Post study EGFR TKI             | 61%               | 17%                 |
| Median survival (95% CI) months | 19.5 (16.4; 23.3) | 9.6 (9.0; 10.4)     |

The table above well illustrates the expected differences between 'Asian' (Japan, China, Korea) and Caucasian patients. In Asian patients enrolled in this study, EGFR TK mutations are expected in about 40% of the patients vs. about 10% in Caucasians. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKI) were also more frequently used in Asians (61 vs. 17%).

In Asians PFS was 0.88 in favour of cetuximab, while OS favoured the chemotherapy (CTX) only arm (1.18). This may relate to more frequent use of TKI in the CTX only arm (73% vs. 50%).

Based on these findings it is considered reasonable to further analyse study outcome in Caucasians only.

As PFS data also in Caucasians were unconvincing (HR 0.93), differential use of next line therapies was raised as a concern at the SAG meeting.

While  being  reasonable,  the  outcome  in  Caucasians  still  refers  to  an  analysis  for  which  no  alpha spending was foreseen. The difference at the median tends to underestimate the treatment effect. Post study anti-cancer therapy is considered unlikely to contribute to observed difference in OS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pooled efficacy analysis

In order to further confirm the robustness of the add-on efficacy and to receive a more precise estimate of the overall treatment effect of cetuximab to standard CTX a pooled efficacy analysis on raw data was  performed  based  on  the  4  randomized  clinical  studies  with  comparable  study  populations  and treatment regimens.

## Forest Plot of Results for OS time and PFS time

<!-- image -->

P-values &lt;0.05 were obtained for all endpoints:  OS p=0.010, PFS p=0.036, and ORR p&lt;0.001.

A high unmet medical need remains in the treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC, because only limited improvements in OS were achieved with new treatments, in particular in patients with NSCLC other  than  predominantly  adenocarcinoma.  Therefore,  the  MAH  has  analyzed  the  efficacy  of cetuximab  treatment  in  the  subgroups  of  NSCLC  patients  with  adenocarcinoma  and  with  nonadenocarcinoma.

## 2.3. Safety Reanalysis

In  order  to  evaluate  the  risk-benefit  of  cetuximab  in  patients  with  non-adenocarcinoma,  safety  data were  compared  between  the  non-adenocarcinoma  population  (N=1012)  and  the  safety  population (N=1970). The safety analyses presented here focus on a comparison of all AEs, grade 3/4 AEs, grade 4  AEs,  SAEs,  AEs  of  particular  relevance  (special  AE  categories,  infectious  complications),  and deaths, in patients with non-adenocarcinoma and the safety population.

Overall the safety profile of cetuximab in the non-adenocarcinoma population was comparable to the safety profile in the safety population.

## Comparison of AE frequencies (any grade, grade 3 and 4, grade 4 and serious AEs)

An overview of frequencies of AEs, grade 3 and grade 4 AEs, grade 4 AEs, and SAEs, in the safety population  compared  to  the  non-adenocarcinoma  population  by  treatment  group  is  shown  in  the following table.

## Overview of Adverse Event Frequencies by Treatment Group and Histological Subgroup

|                             | Safety population (% patients)   | Safety population (% patients)   | Non adenocarcinoma population (% patients)   | Non adenocarcinoma population (% patients)   |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Nature of adverse event     | Cetuximab + CTX (N=979)          | CTX (N=991)                      | Cetuximab + CTX (N=513)                      | CTX (N=499)                                  |
| Any adverse event           | 974 (99.5)                       | 975 (98.4)                       | 510 (99.4)                                   | 489 (98.0)                                   |
| Grade 3 or 4 adverse events | 837 (85.5)                       | 749 (75.6)                       | 437 (85.2)                                   | 375 (75.2)                                   |
| Grade 4 adverse events      | 476 (48.6)                       | 402 (40.6)                       | 241 (47.0)                                   | 194 (38.9)                                   |
| Any serious adverse event   | 556 (56.8)                       | 409 (41.3)                       | 288 (56.1)                                   | 203 (40.7)                                   |

Key safety parameters remain unchanged in the non-adenocarcinoma histological subgroup compared to the overall safety population.

The difference between treatment groups in terms of SAEs (approx. 15 %), grade 3/4 AEs (approx. 10 %), and grade 4 AEs (approx. 8 %) that was observed in the safety population remained unchanged in the non-adenocarcinoma population. These increases are attributable to side effects that are in line with the well-characterized safety profile of cetuximab and are manageable and did not result in more treatment-related deaths.

It is agreed that the overall safety profile is unaffected by the underlying NSCLC histology. This is not too surprising. The difference between CTX and CTX+ cetuximab with respect to grade 4 events and SAEs is clearly non-trivial.

## Differences in SAEs and grade 4 AEs

In all 4 studies, AEs were routinely analyzed from the first day of any study treatment administration until  30  days  (42  days  for  EMR  62202-011)  after  the  last  infusion  of  any  study  treatment.  As  a consequence the average observation period was longer for cetuximab + CTX compared to CTX alone due to subjects who continued on cetuximab therapy (median of 6 to11 weeks) after the end of CTX. Previous analysis on any SAEs and grade 4 AEs did not take into account the different observation periods.  The  combined  frequencies  of  subjects  with  SAEs  and  grade  4  AEs  in  all  4  randomized controlled  studies  were  56.8%  (556/979)  and  48.6%  (476/979)  for  cetuximab  +  CTX  and  41.3% (409/991)  and  40.6%  (402/991)  for  CTX  alone  resulting  in  a  difference  of  15.5%  and  8.0%, respectively.

## Adverse Events During the CTX Phase 1 (all 4 Studies)

|             | Number of subjects   | Number of subjects   |            |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------|
|             | Cet + CTX            | CTX                  | Difference |
|             | N=975 2 (100%)       | N=991 (100%)         |            |
| SAEs        | 487 (49.9%)          | 386 (39.0%)          | 10.9%      |
| grade 4 AEs | 427 (43.8%)          | 379 (38.2%)          | 5.6%       |

Assessing comparable observation periods reduced the difference between treatment arms from 15.5% to 10.9% in SAEs and form 8.0% to 5.6% in grade 4 AEs.

The  increase  in  serious  adverse  events  in  the  cetuximab  arms  is  considered  non-trivial.  In  study 62 202-046 at least one SAE was reported by 56% vs. 42% of the patients.

| Febrile neutropenia                                | 18%                                                | 12%   |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Gastrointestinal SAEs                              | 7%                                                 | 5%    |
| General physical health deterioration              | 3.5%                                               | 0.7%  |
| 'Metabolism and nutrition' (mainly dehydration) 5% | 'Metabolism and nutrition' (mainly dehydration) 5% | 2%    |

In terms of deaths (up to 30 days after the end of therapy) a higher rate was reported for the cetuximab +  CTX  group  which  can  be  explained  by  the  longer  observation  period.  When  standardizing  for similar  observation  periods  the  number  of  deaths  was  comparable  (12.9%  vs  11.6%).  Moreover treatment-related deaths were low and comparable between cetuximab + CTX and CTX alone (1.4% and 1.2%, respectively). As expected the SAEs and grade 4 AEs were in line with the well established safety  profile.  The  SAEs  and  grade  4  AEs  were  manageable  and  did  not  result  in  more  treatmentrelated deaths.

## Adverse events of special interest in NSCLC Patients

## Infectious complications with focus on grade 3 and 4 and serious AEs

In the 4 randomized controlled studies 224 subjects in the cetuximab + CTX groups experienced at least  one severe infectious complication (defined as febrile neutropenia, pneumonia or septic event)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

compared to 163 subjects in the CTX group. 22/224 (9.8%) subjects in the cetuximab + CTX group and 13/163 (8.0%) subjects in the CTX group have a reported outcome of death, respectively.

## Thromboembolic complications

The  combined  analysis  of  all  4  studies  revealed  a  higher  frequency  of  grade  3  and  4  events  for cetuximab + CTX (6.8%; 67/979) compared to CTX alone (4.8%; 48/991). The most frequent events were pulmonary embolism (3.4%; 33/979 for cetuximab + CTX and 2.3%; 23/991 for CTX alone); and deep vein thrombosis (2.2%; 22/979 in the  cetuximab  +  CTX  group  and  1.5%;  15/991  for  the CTX alone group).

Thromboembolic events are listed, but a 2% absolute increase is of clinical relevance.

## Incidence of cardiac events in patients with cardiac history and patients of over 65 years of age

In an additional safety analysis a higher Incidence of cardiac events in elderly patients with cardiac history  was  observed.  No  differences  by  age  seen  in  acne  like  rash,  infusion  related  reactions, mucositis, hemorrhage, thromboembolic events and septic events

## 2.4. Overall benefit risk and grounds for refusal of the variation.

Platinum-based  doublets  have  for  long  been  considered  standard  therapy  in  patients  with  advanced NSCLC.  Recently,  however,  bevacizumab  was  licensed  as  add-on  therapy  in  patients  with  nonsquamous NSCLC.

Large confirmatory studies have been conducted with erlotinib and gefitinib (EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors)  as  add-on  to  platinum  based  regimens  without  any  discernable  add-on  activity  in  an unselected population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This submission refers to the use of cetuximab as add-on to standard platinum based doublets. In the largest  trial  (FLEX)  designed  to  demonstrate  a  survival  benefit  of  cetuximab  add-on,  a  small  (HR 0.87) but borderline significant (p=0.044) effect was shown. Post hoc, an analysis excluding Asians due  to  their  today  well  known  and  well  characterised  different  tumour  biology  on  a  group  level resulted in a p-value of 0.003. In a pooled analysis of all studies and including all patients the p-value was 0.010.

Study CA225099 was designed to show a Progression-free survival (PFS) benefit and was the only study with independent verification of tumour progression. Based on independent review this study failed  to  meet  its  objectives  (p=0.24),  but  results  were  statistically  significant  based  on  investigator data  and  in  a  post  hoc  time  to  treatment  failure  analysis.  None  of  the  other  studies  showed  a statistically significant effect. In a pooled analysis the results were borderline significant (0.036).

An increased response rate has been convincingly demonstrated in the individual studies, including CA225099, i.e. the study with independent verification.

The  documented  patient  benefit  in  terms  of  survival  is  small,  HR  0.88  corresponding  to  a  median benefit of 1+ months (pooled analysis). The most favourable results were those in Caucasians in the FLEX study (HR 0.80 corresponding to 2 months median benefit, estimated from the HR). Due to the uncertainties with respect to PFS as discussed above, PFS benefit is hard to estimate.

A proposed restriction to patients with NSCLC with non-adenocarcinoma histology was discussed. In this subgroup, survival results are borderline better (HR 0.83 vs. 0.94) while PFS is very similar (HR 0.89 vs. 0.90), i.e. non-convincing with respect to differential activity. However, there is no licensed product which has shown an add-on survival benefit to standard therapy in this group of patients.

The tolerability/toxicity profile of cetuximab is considered relatively well characterised also as add-on to various chemotherapy regimens. Very common and common adverse reactions of importance for tolerability  encompass  skin  reactions,  diarrhoea,  mucositis,  nausea,  fatigue,  etc.  Less  common,  but severe and serious reactions include neutropenic fever and other infectious complications, thromboembolic  complications,  cardiac  events,  dehydration  and  severe  infusion  related  reactions which may be fatal.

Despite a large and comprehensive studies programme investigating the add-on use of cetuximab to standard platinum-based doublets in the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC, the documented benefit is considered borderline and appears not to outweigh the risk.

During the SAG oncology meeting, there was a split view among oncologists as to the magnitude of the clinical benefit. The field of treatment of NSCLC is characterised by small steps towards improved efficacy and moreover cetuximab exhibited add-on effects on survival in patients with tumours of nonadenocarcinoma  histology.  The  documented  survival  benefit  is  undoubtedly  small,  but  the  risk associated with the add-on use of cetuximab is well characterised, i.e. can and should influence the decision  whether  to  treat  or  not  an  individual  patient  with  cetuximab.  Unfortunately  biomarkers  or clinical characteristics (other than those generally applicable) cannot be used to guide this decision.

Rash (and probably diarrhoea) is a very common and often disturbing side effect of cetuximab, but associated  with  a  favourable  outcome.  As  it  is  an  on-treatment  effect,  it  cannot  be  stated  that  it  is predictive of benefit of therapy, but it is a good prognostic sign. This is of some importance for the individual patient on therapy experiencing these side effects.

Incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac events on cetuximab treatment is increased in patients &gt; 65 years with cardiac history in NSCLC patients. The issue should be further investigated across indications.

In  conclusion,  in  the  presented  trials  the  estimated  benefit  of  add-on  cetuximab  to  standard chemotherapy in terms of survival is considered modest (HR 0.88) and statistically non-compelling in the  light  of  non-convincing  effects  in  terms  of  PFS.  Documented  benefits  are  not  considered  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

outweigh the tolerability and safety concerns, including an increased risk for grade 4 AE:s and SAE:s in studies CA225099 and EMR 62202-046.

Despite a large and comprehensive studies programme investigating the add-on use of cetuximab to standard platinum-based doublets in the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC, the documented benefit is borderline statistically and clinically and does not outweigh the risks.

Therefore, the Benefit - risk ratio of Erbitux in the indication of:

'first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR)-expressing advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy'

is considered negative.

Some members of the CHMP expressed a divergent position as follows:

Although very modest in absolute terms, the effect on Overall survival is a very relevant effect in relative terms due to the short survival, and is similar to incremental improvement achieved with other agents in NSCLC.

The lack of convincing supportive data in terms of PFS was considered not to be critical because the overall pattern was generally consistent with OS in terms of a favourable treatment effect.

There is an unmet medical need particularly in patients with tumors of non-adenocarcinoma histology.

The added toxicity was of some concern but it was considered manageable and in the overall balance did not outweigh the benefits in a condition where there are only few treatments with an effect on OS.

## 3. Re-Examination procedure

The Applicant in response to CHMP negative opinion requested a re-examination on grounds of safety and efficacy as analysed below

## 3. 1. Grounds for re-examination - Safety aspects

The major concern of the CHMP seemed to be that the modest benefit of erbitux was likely to be outweighed by the non-trivial side-effects of the treatment.

The  CHMP  regarded  the  risk  associated  with  the  add-on  use  of  cetuximab  as  well  characterized. However,  the  CHMP  considered  the  documented  benefits  of  adding  cetuximab  to  platinum-based chemotherapy  not  to  outweigh  the  tolerability  and  safety  concerns,  including  an  increased  risk  for grade 4 AEs and SAEs. In addition it was noticed that the Kaplan-Meier survival curves, particularly for  study  EMR  62  202-046,  did  not  separate  during  the  first  6  months  of  treatment.  One  possible explanation was that early treatment benefit might be balanced by toxic deaths during the CTX phase.

The MAH presented further analyses to support that the add-on toxicity of cetuximab when added to CTX is clearly  reduced  in  patients  &lt;65  years  compared  to  patients ≥ 65  years  and  compared  to  the overall safety population in NSCLC. Importantly, in patients &lt;65 years the addition of cetuximab to CTX increased the rate of grade 4 AEs only by 3.8% compared to 14.7% in patients ≥ 65 years. This difference is also reflected in the rate of AEs leading to deaths: In patients &lt;65 years with cetuximab + CTX the rate of AEs reported with outcome deaths was only marginally increased compared to CTX (0.4%)  whereas  in  patients ≥ 65  years  this  rate  was  increased  by  9.9%.  The  same  trend  was  also observed for grade 3/4 toxicities and for SAEs (grade 3/4 AEs increase of 7.4% in patients &lt;65 years vs. 13.7% in patients &gt;65 years; SAEs increase of 13.1% in patients &lt;65 years vs. 19.6% in patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

≥ 65 years). The improved safety profile of cetuximab in combination with CTX in patients &lt;65years is also seen in the histological subgroup of non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC. In the population ≥ 65 years the most important finding was the increased incidence of cardiac events (grade 3/4, grade 4 and SAE) in the cetuximab + CTX group particularly in patients with cardiac history. Cardiac events accounted for about half of the additional AEs with reported outcome death in the cetuximab + CTX group.

The MAH concluded that the safety profile of cetuximab + CTX in patients &lt;65 years is improved compared to the safety population.

The Applicant has now made a considerable effort to document that the Erbitux has a more favourable safety profile in patients with NSCLC under the age of 65 years which is not surprising. According to the presented data the add-on therapy has been poorly tolerated in the elderly, more frail patients (with more co-morbidities) who have experienced more SAEs, grade 3 and 4 toxicities and deaths in the pooled safety  evaluation.  It  has  been  documented  that  the  effect  of  add-on  therapy  with  Erbitux  in patients aged ≥ 65 years is diluted by the higher risk of death due to AEs in this subpopulation.

Importantly,  an  increased  incidence  of cardiac  events has  been  identified  in  the  cetuximab  +  CTX group  in  patients  aged ≥ 65  year,  particularly  in  high-risk  patients  with  a  cardiac  history.  It  is recommended  that  the  Applicant  should  undertake  an  investigation  of  this  safety  signal  in  all indications approved or under investigation.

Interestingly, the Applicant has also explored the safety profile of Erbitux in the important subgroup of patients with non-adenocarcinoma, and the safety findings in this subpopulation seems consistent with the safety profile in the overall population and as such independent of the histological tumour subtype.

Although these are post-hoc analyses, the study protocol for Erbitux in NSCLC pre-specified the two subpopulations  by  age  (&lt;  or ≥ 65  years).  Furthermore,  the  Applicant  has  used  a  Cox  proportional hazard model with 3 age levels to support the use of 65 years as the most appropriate age cutpoint. The difference between the 2 age groups is that for those ≥ 65 years an increased number of deaths occurred within the first few months of the trial with multiple causes and about half being preceded by a  cardiac  AE.  These  early  deaths  affected  the  Kaplan-Meier  survival  curves  particularly  for  study EMR 62 202-046.  However, whether this observation was a chance finding or indeed reflects some add-on toxicity from cetuximab, needs to be clarified by the MAH and clarification of this point is central  to  the  validity  of  the  sub-group  analysis  in  support  of  an  improved  benefit:risk  balance  as proposed by the MAH for those &lt;65 years and the need for further safety assessment of cetuximab in licensed indications for those   &gt;65 years.

## 3. 2 Grounds for re-examination - Efficacy aspects

## Results in Patients &lt;65 Years

In the pivotal study EMR 62 202-046 the OS benefit (primary endpoint) in the patient population &lt;65 years for cetuximab + CTX vs. CTX is seen early as the Kaplan-Maier curves separate from the start, with a median OS benefit of 1.5 months ( see Figure 10 ). This difference in median OS (11.5 vs. 10.0 months) was greater compared to 1.2 months for the ITT population (11.3 vs. 10.1 months). The 1year  survival  rate  for  patients  &lt;65  years  was  also  more  improved  compared  to  the  ITT  population (difference  of  7%  vs.  5.1%).  In  patients  &lt;65  years  the  HR  for  OS  was  0.85  [95%  CI:  0.72-0.99; p=0.043] reflecting improvement in survival by 18% in the cetuximab + CTX group compared to the CTX group, which is also an improvement when compared to the ITT population (HR 0.87).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

The increased OS benefit for cetuximab + CTX is further confirmed in the pooled analysis including all  4  randomized,  controlled  studies  for  the  ITT  population  &lt;65  years.  The  early  separation  of  the Kaplan-Meier curves is also observed for the pooled population. In contrast, in the study CA225099, the  improved  safety  in  patients  &lt;65  years  does  not  translate  in  an  improvement  in  median  OS (secondary endpoint) and HR in patients &lt;65 years.

Efficacy results are summarized for the ITT population &lt;65 years in Table 12 .

*For TTF only studies EMR 62 202-046 + CA 225099 were included in the pooled analysis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Time to treatment failure

More patients in the CTX group in study EMR 62 202-046 (ITT population) went off study without image  based  PD  and  were  therefore  censored  (18%  vs.  24%).  The  time  to  treatment  failure  was therefore  calculated  as  a  post-hoc  sensitivity  analysis,  also  taking  into  account  events  which  were considered  signs  of  clinical  progression  (non-image-proven  PD  and  start  of  any  new  anti-cancer treatment).  TTF  in  patients  &lt;65  years  was  significantly  prolonged  favouring  the  cetuximab  +  CTX group (HR 0.83 [95% CI: 0.72-0.97], p=0.02, ( see Table 12 ). TTF was also improved in CA225099 and pooled analysis.

## Subgroup analyses

The results of subgroup analyses of OS time in the ITT population &lt;65 years (EMR 62 202-046) are summarized in Figure 11 .

|                             | BenefitCet+CTX Benefit CTX | BenefitCet+CTX Benefit CTX |

The  forest  plot  demonstrates  that  the  addition  of  cetuximab  to  CTX  was  generally  associated  with benefit over CTX alone in terms of OS time in the ITT population &lt;65 years but not for the Asian population ( see Figure 11 ). This was further supported in the pooled analysis. Subgroup analyses of the treatment effect showed advantages in terms of OS favouring cetuximab + CTX compared to CTX in all histological subtypes.

## Caucasian patients &lt;65 years

In the overall ITT population the most favourable results were those for Caucasians in study EMR 62 202-046 with a p-value of 0.003 (HR 0.8 corresponding to 2 months median benefit, calculated from the  HR).  In  this  context  the  CHMP  acknowledged  that  the  Asian  patients  are  different  due  to  their today well known and well characterized different tumor biology. Therefore the Caucasian population better  reflects  the  patients  treated  mainly  in  Europe than  the  overall  ITT  population.  For  Caucasian patients &lt;65 years the combination of cetuximab+CTX demonstrated a significant median OS benefit of 1.7 months (10.8 vs. 9.1 months, HR 0.76) in the pivotal study EMR 62 202-046. Calculating the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

corresponding benefit to the HR of 0.76 [95% CI: 0.64-0.91] in this population the median OS benefit is 2.9 months.

The Kaplan-Meier curve for Caucasian patients &lt; 65 years is shown in Figure 12.

## Results for Non-Adenocarcinoma &lt;65 years

Recent  progress  has  been  made  in  particular  in  adenocarcinoma  in  the  treatment  of  advanced  or metastatic  NSCLC,  whereas  improvements  in  terms  of  survival  have  not  been  achieved  in  the  last decade  for  the  treatment  of  non-adenocarcinoma.  Therefore  a  high  unmet  medical  need  remains, especially in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC other than adenocarcinoma. The increased benefit in NSCLC patients with non-adenocarcinoma histology was acknowledged by the CHMP, and it was pointed out that cetuximab is unique among licensed products as a treatment option for tumors of non-adenocarcinoma histology, with documented add-on effects on survival. Therefore, the sponsor has  analyzed  the  efficacy  of  cetuximab  treatment  in  the  subgroup  of  NSCLC  patients  with  nonadenocarcinoma. In study EMR 62 202-046 the OS and PFS benefit for patients &lt;65 years in the nonadenocarcinoma histology with cetuximab + CTX was further improved (OS: HR: 0.74 [95% CI: 0.600.93], PFS: HR: 0.79 [95% CI: 0.63-0.99]) when compared to the ITT population ( see Figure 13 ). Of note, the OS curve separates early indicating an add-on benefit of cetuximab during the CTX phase.

OS benefits seen in patients with non-adenocarcinoma and age &lt;65 years were consistent across subgroups supporting the main survival findings.

## Quality of Life

Quality of life (QoL) was assessed in study EMR 62 202-046 by means of EORTC QLQC30 Global Health Status. The assessment concluded that no significant differences in the QoL score between the treatment groups was observed during the period of the first 6 months after randomization.

In accordance with the safety and efficacy analyses performed in different subgroups, additional QoL analyses  were  performed  for  the  following  subgroups:  ITT;  age  &lt;  65years;  age ≥ 65years;  nonadenocarcinoma and age &lt; 65years. It was planned to also carry out an analysis on the subgroup: nonadenocarcinoma and age ≥ 65 years. However, there were not sufficient subjects with QL data in this subgroup  to  perform  the  analysis.  The  analyses  were  performed  on  the  multi-item  scales  from  the EORTC QLQ-C30, (i.e. the global health status\\QL scale, the functional scales: physical functioning, role  functioning,  emotional  functioning,  cognitive  functioning,  social  functioning,  three  symptom scales: fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain) and the Dyspnoea scale from the EORTC QLQ-LC13. Overall  in  patients  &lt;65  years  the  treatment  differences  were  smaller  than  in  the  original  study, indicating less impact on all 3 scales at cycle 3 by cetuximab + CTX. The subset analyses suggested that the subset ≥ 65 years showed the largest differences between treatment groups in favour of CTX alone. In patients &lt;65 years with non-adenocarcinoma the results were comparable to the total patient population &lt;65 years.

## Efficacy Conclusions

The primary endpoint OS shows a median of 1.5 months improvement. The most favourable results were those seen in the Caucasian patients with an OS HR of 0.76 corresponding to 2.9 months median benefit  estimated  from  the  HR  in  EMR  62  202-046.  Due  to  the  differences  in  Asian  patients,  the Caucasian population better reflects the patients treated mainly in Europe. While improved safety in patients &lt;65 years does not translate in study CA225099 in an improvement in median OS and HR in patients  &lt;65  years  the  Kaplan-Meier  curve  for  patients  &lt;65  years  separate  early  supporting  the findings of study EMR 62 202-046. In the non-adenocarcinoma population &lt;65 years the findings of study CA225099 were consistent with those of study EMR 62 202-046. Most importantly the early separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves was consistent for overall survival in the pivotal study EMR 62 202-046 and the supportive study CA225099 demonstrating a benefit for patients &lt;65 years treated with  cetuximab  +  CTX  compared  to  CTX  alone  from  start  of  treatment  onwards  supporting  the concept of reducing early death in the cetuximab + CTX group.

Post-hoc subgroup analyses were conducted with the aim of improving the benefit-risk profile in an identified sub-population, primarily by reducing the number of early, serious adverse events which it is speculated had a detrimental effect on OS.  Post-hoc subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution; in particular it is difficult to know whether a subgroup has been identified as having improved efficacy / safety because these patients genuinely respond better to treatment, or simply due to chance. In  any  clinical  trial  some  subgroups  will  artificially  appear  to  do  better  than  the  overall  patient population  due  to  chance  alone.    Key  considerations  as  to  whether  this  type  of  analysis  can  be accepted  include  the  biological  plausibility  of  finding  an  improved  response  in  the  subgroup  and consistency  of  the  evidence  of  the  improved  effect  across  the  different  sources  of  evidence  (trials) provided.

Examining  the  OS  data  in  the  two  main  trials  for  trial  046,  those  &lt;65  years  have  a  1.5  month difference with a slightly lower HR than the ITT.  For trial -099 the OS for those &lt;65 years is 0.5 months (compared with 1.3 months for the ITT) with a larger HR than the ITT.  The PFS data for the &lt;65 years group in each of the large controlled trails is less convincing than the PFS data for the ITT.

The proposition made by the MAH is that based on the subgroup analysis the benefit: risk is more favourable for patients &lt;65 years due to less early deaths in the trial seen in those ≥ 65 years.  It is agreed that in those &lt;65 years there are less early deaths, but overall the absolute % of SAE are similar between those &lt;65 years and the total population.

On the basis of the above analyses the Applicant proposed during the re-examination to modify the indication as follows:

'Erbitux is indicated in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing advanced or metastatic non-small cell  lung  cancer.  A  positive  risk-benefit  ratio  was  not  demonstrated  in  patients  65  years  of  age  or older (see section 4.4 and 5.1)' ,

It  is  proposed  that  the  SAG-Oncology  should  be  re-consulted  on  the  clinical  relevance/need  of treatment  of  Erbitux  in  patients  under  the  age  of  65  years  where  the  safety  profile  appears  more favourable. Given the finding of an increased incidence of cardiac events in patients aged ≥ 65 years of age, the Applicant should undertake an investigation of this safety signal in all indications approved or under investigation.

Finally, the modest increase in OS in those &lt;65 years was not reflected in PFS.

Therefore the  proposal  that  an  improved  benefit:  risk  in  those  &lt;65  years  is  not  supported  from  the efficacy data.  With the exception of early deaths in those &gt;65 years the overall incidence in SAEs was similar in those &lt;65years to that seen in the initial ITT population.  Multiple sub-group analyses were performed which raises concern about the validity of conclusions drawn as the results in each trial and in the pooled analysis were not consistent.

Therefore, the CHMP recommends that the SAG-Oncology should be re-consulted on the grounds for negative  opinion  in  view  of  the  grounds  for  re-examination  submitted,  in  particular  on  the  clinical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

relevance  and  need  of  treatment  of  Erbitux  in  patients  under  the  age  of  65  years  where  the  safety profile is claimed to be more favourable.

## 3. 3 Discussion at the SAG-Oncology

The following questions were discussed at the SAG-O convened on the re-examination:

1. What is the view of the SAG on the discordance between the PFS and OS results?  Are the data on OS considered reliable in light of the less favourable data on PFS?

It  is  difficult  to  speculate  on  the  discordance  between  PFS  and  OS,  although  it  is  an  unexpected finding. Concerning the importance of this poor correlation, this may suggest that the effect on OS could be due to treatment given after progression although this remains a hypothesis. The SAG agreed that  in  this  setting,  the  most  relevant  clinical  endpoints  to  balance  benefits  and  risks  are  OS  and toxicity,  and  some  members argued that one should not put too much emphasis on the presence or absence of effect on PFS.

2. What is the view of the SAG on the use of post-hoc subgroup analyses in this setting to substantiate a positive benefit: risk balance in NSCLC in those &lt;65 years?

In  general,  the  conclusions  from  post-hoc  subgroup  analyses  to  substantiate  the  main  claim  of  a positive benefit-risk profile cannot be considered as reliable to establish clinical efficacy or safety, or to formally establish the existence of interactions with treatment, due to multiplicity and the possibility of introducing bias. In this case, there is no established biological rationale for the chosen cut-off. If this hypothetic finding is considered worthy of further investigation it should be formally confirmed prospectively,  using  robust  methodology.  In  any  case,  even  in  the  proposed  subset  of  patients  &lt;65 years  old,  the  magnitude  of  the  effect  was  at  best  of  very  modest  clinical  significance,  although  it achieved early separation of the survival curves. It should be mentioned that in the subgroup analyses we observed no clinical response in Stage III patients (although few patients have been enrolled.

3. What is the view of the SAG of the adverse event profile in patients &lt;65 years compared to that in the original ITT population, including all patients regardless of age?

The observed adverse event profile in the subgroup appeared to be slightly improved in the analyses presented. According to some SAG members, in lung cancer a survival advantage of about 6 weeks is meaningful, if we compare these data to other studies, and the effect is unlikely to be due to further lines  of  therapy.  Accordingly  some  SAG  members  concluded  that  in  the  patient  group  &lt;  65  years, there was a positive benefit/risk balance.

However,  most  of  the  SAG  members  agreed  that  due  to  the  post-hoc  methodology  employed  to address efficacy, it is difficult to draw formal conclusions about this subgroup. It would be of interest, however, to explore the interaction between  age and cetuximab-associated toxicity in other indications.  For  the  time  being,  even  assuming  that  the  slightly  improved  safety  profile  in  younger patients  is  real,  the  toxicity  remained  significant  although  manageable  and  compared  unfavourably against the very modest effect in terms of OS.

4.  Does  the  SAG  consider  that  the  estimated  overall  survival  benefit  of  cetuximab  as  add-on  to standard chemotherapy in those &lt;65 years represents adequate and statistically compelling evidence in view of the PFS data?

The claimed OS advantage is now based on a post-hoc analysis. From a methodological point of view, this  level  of  evidence  is  far  from  compelling  and  in  any  case  insufficient  to  draw  any  conclusions about  the  efficacy  or  the  safety  in  the  subgroup.  Even  accepting  the  methodological  flaws,  the magnitude of the effect was at best of very modest clinical significance.

A  minority  of  the  members  insisted  on  the  fact  that  although  modest,  the  effect  observed  with cetuximab was in the same order of magnitude of what has been observed with other active agents for the treatment of advanced NSCLC.

## 3.4 Issues addressed at the Oral Explanation and discussion on the benefit-risk ratio

Due to progressive reduction of organ function and age-dependent co-morbidities affecting functional status,  general  health,  and  tumor  symptoms,  toxicity  to  anti-cancer  therapy  is  reported  to  be aggravated  in  patients ≥ 65  years.  As  per  the  ICH  E7  (studies  in  support  of  special  populations: geriatrics)  guideline  and  in  line  with  current  practice, the  clinical  study  protocols  for  cetuximab  in NSCLC defined two subpopulations by age, younger than 65 years and 65 years or older. Therefore, the Applicant performed additional safety analyses by age (younger patients, defined as &lt;65 years and elderly patients, defined as ≥ 65 years), and consequentially also efficacy analyses by age, in order to re-assess the risk/benefit ratio of cetuximab in NSCLC. These analyses included an evaluation of the appropriateness of the use of 65 years as the cut-point.

The proposition made by the MAH is that based on the subgroup analysis the benefit: risk is more favourable for patients &lt;65 years due to less early deaths early in the trial seen in those ≥ 65 years.

It is agreed that in those &lt;65 years there are less early deaths, but overall the absolute % of SAE are similar between those &lt;65 years and the total population.

It can be considered biologically plausible that a subgroup of these fragile elderly patients are at higher risk  of  experiencing  fatal  toxicities  related  to  treatment  containing  cetuximab,  thereby  shifting  the B/R-ratio in a negative direction in this subgroup of patients. In general, age is an important prognostic factor that is taken into consideration by medical oncologists and haematologists on a daily basis. It is a well-known fact that intensive treatment regimens are poorly tolerated in elderly populations with numerous co-morbidities and that well-defined age limits play an important role in the selection of treatment options and in the planning of clinical trials for several malignancies, e.g. AML and multiple myeloma (thalidomide indicated in patients ≥ 65  years  of  age).  As  such  there  could  be  a biological rationale behind an improved B/R-ratio in younger cetuximab-treated patients. Whether the threshold should be set at 65 years, could of course be debatable, but this decision was based on a pre-specified subdivision  of  the  study  population  in  the  protocol  and  a  post-hoc  analysis  of  age  as  a  continuous variable  vs.  outcome  showing  that  the  65  years  was  the  most  optimal  cut-off  point.  Based  on  the results  of  the  trial  this  cut-off  point  is  merely  considered  as  supportive  information  for  the  treating physicians.

It  has  to  be  emphasized  however  that  post-hoc  subgroup  analyses  were  conducted  with  the  aim  of improving the benefit-risk profile in an identified sub-population, primarily by reducing the number of early, serious adverse events which it is speculated had a detrimental effect on OS.  Post-hoc subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution; in particular it is difficult to know whether a subgroup has been identified as having improved efficacy / safety because these patients genuinely respond better to treatment, or simply due to chance.  In any clinical trial some subgroups will artificially appear to do better than the overall patient population due to chance alone.  Key considerations as to whether this type of analysis can be accepted include the biological plausibility of finding an improved response in the subgroup and consistency of the evidence of the improved effect across the different sources of evidence (trials) provided.

Examining  the  OS  data  in  the  two  main  trials  for  trial  046,  those  &lt;65  years  have  a  1.5  month difference with a slightly lower HR than the ITT.  For trial -099 the OS (secondary endpoint) for those &lt;65 years is 0.5 months (compared with 1.3 months for the ITT) with a larger HR than the ITT.  The PFS data for the &lt;65 years group in each of the large controlled trails is less convincing than the PFS data for the ITT.

## The MAH during an Oral Explanation at the CHMP focused on the following issues:

The proposed indication is based on a post hoc subgroup analysis that was not intended to be the basis for  confirmation  of  efficacy.  The  MAH  discussed  whether  this approach  is  statistically  robust considering the  biological  plausibility  of  the  hypotheses  on  which  the  proposal  is  based  and  the apparent  lack  of  consistency  of  effects  in  this  subgroup  in  the  two  pivotal  trials.  The  MAH also presented PFS curves for study 046 in Caucasian patients &lt; and &gt; 65 years of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It  is  of  particular  interest  to  seek  external  validation of the hypothesis that age and smoking-related comorbidities  were  responsible  for  this  toxicity  in  other  indications.  Given  the  similarities  in  risk factors,  life-style  and  resulting  co-morbidities,  the  comparison  between  patients  with  NSCLC  and SCCHN (squamous cell cancer of the head and neck) was considered most pertinent for this purpose. The MAH elaborated on these data and submitted an overview of the absolute number of total deaths and the grade 3 and 4 events in patients with SCCHN.  The applicant provided survival curves for patients &lt; and &gt; 65 years of age for the two randomised head and neck cancer studies.

The estimated benefit of add-on cetuximab to standard chemotherapy in terms of survival in those &lt;65 years  is  considered  modest  (HR  0.86)  and  statistically  non-compelling and  is  not  considered  to outweigh the tolerability and safety concerns.  According to the subgroup analysis (both in the entire ITT population and in patients &lt; 65 years of age) patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) seem to have the most benefit from add-on treatment with cetuximab. The excess toxicity in those &gt;65 years was considered by the MAH to be related to co-morbidities in these subjects as a result of smoking. The MAH also discussed the benefit-risk ratio of cetuximab in the subgroup of patients with SCC who have a high unmet medical need considering that SCC of the lung is largely a disease of older patients with a history of smoking.

## Following the oral explanation, the CHMP concluded that:

- The magnitute of effect in terms of overall survival as estimated from post-hoc subgroup analyses is not consistent across trials and not supported by an improvement in progression-free survival.
- Even in a proposed subset of patients &lt;65 years old, the effect seen is at best of very modest clinical significance and due to methodological concerns, multiplicity and the possibility of introducing bias, it cannot be considered as reliable to establish clinical efficacy or safety.
- The toxicity (rash, diarrhea) remained significant although well known and manageable and compared unfavourably against the very modest effect in terms of OS, therefore the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk profile in the indication:

Erbitux in combination with platinum -based chemotherapy for the first -line treatment of patients with epidermal-growth factor receptor (EGFR) -expressing advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer

## is negative and reconfirmed its initial negative opinion.

A minority view acknowledged that study EMR 62 202-046 has demonstrated a significant overall survival benefit of 1.5 months as compared to what is usually seen in this setting, favoring the use of Erbitux as add-on therapy in patients with advanced, EGFR-expressing NSCLC.

In view of the poor prognosis and the slow, but stepwise, improvement in survival benefit related to new therapies in NSCLC, a medium gain of 1.5 months in OS (primary endpoint) in the pivotal trial (046) in patients &lt; 65 years of age is difficult to disregard. A similar result was found in the pooled analysis of studies whereas no significant gain in OS (secondary endpoint) was found in study -099.

In patients aged &lt; 65 years of age, this benefit is even more evident. This observation is well-known and consistent among indications and due to well-known differences in tumor biology, the benefit was even more pronounced in Caucasians.

In  further  support,  TTF  was  significantly  prolonged  and  there  were  indications  of  less  impact  on quality of life in patients &lt;65 years favouring the cetuximab + CTX group.

The inconsistencies noted in terms of PFS could be explained and nevertheless the overall survival is a harder and more important endpoint.

The clinical benefit is of more importance in the histological subgroup of squamous cell carcinoma where there have been no recent developments and there is a high unmet medical need.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## IV. CONCLUSION

On 19 November 2009 the CHMP considered the re-examination of this Type II variation and agreed that  the  changes  to  the  terms  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  should  be  refused  on  the  following grounds:

Whereas,

- The estimated magnitude of the treatment effect on overall survival is complicated by methodological concerns relating to retrospective subgroup analyses conducted to identify patients with a more favourable benefit-risk.  The effect on progression-free survival does not give strong support to the observed effect on overall survival.
- The effects on overall survival and progression-free survival are of modest clinical significance in the patient population proposed.
- The toxicity, although well known and manageable, is significant.  The estimated effect on overall survival is inadequate to offset this toxicity

and therefore the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk profile of Erbitux in the indication

\"in combination with platinum -based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with epidermal-growth factor receptor (EGFR) -expressing advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer\"

is negative, and reconfirmed its initial opinion of 23 July 2009.
