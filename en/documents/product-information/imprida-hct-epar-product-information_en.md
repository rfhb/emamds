ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Imprida HCT 5 mg/160 mg/12.5 mg film-coated tablets

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each film-coated tablet contains 5 mg of amlodipine (as amlodipine besylate), 160 mg of valsartan, and 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide.

For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Film-coated tablet (tablet) White, ovaloid, biconvex tablets with bevelled edge, debossed 'NVR' on one side and 'VCL' on the other side. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Treatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult patients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled on the combination of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), taken either as three single-component formulations or as a dual-component and a single-component formulation. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The recommended dose of Imprida HCT is one tablet per day, to be taken preferably in the morning. Before switching to Imprida HCT patients should be controlled on stable doses of the monocomponents taken at the same time. The dose of Imprida HCT should be based on the doses of the individual components of the combination at the time of switching. The maximum recommended dose of Imprida HCT is 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

No adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated for use in patients with anuria (see section 4.3) and in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Due to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan and therefore Imprida HCT is not suitable in this group of patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Heart failure and coronary artery disease

There is limited experience with the use of Imprida HCT, particulary at the maximum dose, in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease. Caution is advised in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg.

## Elderly (age 65 years or over)

Caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this patient population are limited.

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of Imprida HCT in the paediatric population (patients below age 18 years) for the indication of essential hypertension.

## Method of administration

Imprida HCT can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water, at the same time of the day and preferably in the morning. 4.3 Contraindications  Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to other sulphonamide derivatives, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the excipients.  Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).  Hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis.  Severe renal impairment (GFR &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ), anuria and patients undergoing dialysis.  Refractory hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, and symptomatic hyperuricaemia. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Sodium- and/or volume-depleted patients Excessive hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, was seen in 1.7% of patients treated with the maximum dose of Imprida HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg) compared to 1.8% of valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (320 mg/25 mg) patients, 0.4% of amlodipine/valsartan (10 mg/320 mg) patients, and 0.2% of hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine (25 mg/10 mg) patients in a controlled trial in patients with moderate to severe uncomplicated hypertension. In sodium-depleted and/or volume-depleted patients, such as those receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Imprida HCT. Imprida HCT should be used only after correction of any pre-existing sodium and/or volume depletion. Medicinal product no longer authorised

If excessive hypotension occurs with Imprida HCT, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been stabilised.

## Serum electrolyte changes

## Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide

In the controlled trial of Imprida HCT, the counteracting effects of valsartan 320 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg on serum potassium approximately balanced each other in many patients. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.

Periodic determination of serum electrolytes and potassium in particular should be performed at appropriate intervals to detect possible electrolyte imbalance, especially in patients with other risk factors such as impaired renal function, treatment with other medicinal products or history of prior electrolyte imbalances.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Valsartan

Concomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) is not recommended. Monitoring of potassium should be undertaken as appropriate.

## Hydrochlorothiazide

Treatment with Imprida HCT should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting hypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate preexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with conditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal (cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide therapy, Imprida HCT should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance.

Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or exacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms (nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide should only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid hyponatraemia develops during Imprida HCT therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until normalisation of natraemia. All patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in electrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. Renal impairment Thiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Imprida HCT is used in patients with renal impairment periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes (including potassium), creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). No dosage adjustment of Imprida HCT is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (GFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ). Renal artery stenosis No data are available on the use of Imprida HCT in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney. Kidney transplantation To date there is no experience of the safe use of Imprida HCT in patients who have had a recent kidney transplantation. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hepatic impairment

Valsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile, whereas amlodipine is extensively metabolised by the liver. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan, and therefore, Imprida HCT is not suitable in this group of patients (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).

## Heart failure and coronary artery disease

As a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar outcomes have been reported with valsartan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New York Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo.

Caution is advised in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in these patient populations is limited.

## Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

As with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients with aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

## Pregnancy

Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6).

## Primary hyperaldosteronism

Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist valsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is not activated. Therefore, Imprida HCT is not recommended in this population.

## Systemic lupus erythematosus

Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate systemic lupus erythematosus.

## Other metabolic disturbances

Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and uric acid. In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents may be required.

Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in symptomatic hyperuricaemia. Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Thiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause intermittant and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing hypercalcaemia. Imprida HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. Serum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Photosensitivity

Cases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If photosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Imprida HCT, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a readministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Acute angle-closure glaucoma

Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to a week of treatment initiation. Untreated acute-angle closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss.

The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatment may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or penicillin allergy.

## General

Caution should be exercised in patients who have shown prior hypersensitivity to other angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide are more likely in patients with allergy and asthma.

Elderly (age 65 years or over) Caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this patient population are limited. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No formal interaction studies with other medicinal products were performed with Imprida HCT. Thus, only information on interactions with other medicinal products that are known for the individual active substances is provided in this section. However, it is important to take into account that Imprida HCT may increase the hypotensive effect of other antihypertensive agents. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Amlodipine with the following

agents

CYP3A4 inhibitors

(i.e. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir)

Medicinal product no longer authorised

CYP3A4 inducers

(anticonvulsant agents

[e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital,

phenytoin, fosphenytoin,

Effect of the interaction with other medicinal products

Concomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate

CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil

or diltiazem) may give rise to significant increase in amlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these

pharmacokinetic variations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may

thus be required.

There is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4

inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant use of CYP3A4

inducers (e.g. rifampicin,

Hypericum perforatum

) may give a lower plasma concentration of amlodipine.

Amlodipine should be used with caution together with

CYP3A4 inducers.

## Pregnancy

Amlodipine

The safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. In animal studies, reproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3). Use in pregnancy is only recommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk for the mother and foetus.

Effect of the interaction with other medicinal products In monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the following substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide.

## Valsartan

The use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.

Exposure to AIIRAs therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3).

Should exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.

Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

## Hydrochlorothiazide

There is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. Animal studies are insufficient.

Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia.

## Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide

There is no experience on the use of Imprida HCT in pregnant women. Based on the existing data with the components, the use of Imprida HCT is not recommended during first trimester and contraindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

## Breast-feeding

No information is available regarding the use of valsartan and/or amlodipine during breast-feeding. Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing intense diuresis can inhibit milk production. The use of Imprida HCT during breast-feeding is not recommended. If Imprida HCT is used during breast-feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. Alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.

## Fertility

There are no clinical studies on fertility with Imprida HCT.

## Valsartan

Valsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day. This dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient).

## Amlodipine

Reversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients treated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of amlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. When driving vehicles or using machines it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

The safety profile of Imprida HCT presented below is based on clinical studies performed with Imprida HCT and the known safety profile of the individual components amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide.

Information on Imprida HCT The safety of Imprida HCT has been evaluated at its maximum dose of 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg in one controlled short-term (8 weeks) clinical study with 2,271 patients, 582 of whom received valsartan in combination with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Adverse reactions were generally mild and transient in nature and only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. In this active controlled clinical trial, the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Imprida HCT were dizziness and hypotension (0.7%). In the 8-week controlled clinical study, no significant new or unexpected adverse reactions were observed with triple therapy treatment compared to the known effects of the monotherapy or dual therapy components. In the 8-week controlled clinical study, changes in laboratory parameters observed with the combination of Imprida HCT were minor and consistent with the pharmacological mechanism of action of the monotherapy agents. The presence of valsartan in the triple combination attenuated the hypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide. The following adverse reactions, listed by MedDRA System Organ Class and frequency, concern Imprida HCT (amlodipine/valsartan/HCT) and amlodipine, valsartan and HCT individually. Very common: ≥1/10; common: ≥1/100 to &lt;1/10; uncommon: ≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100; rare: ≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000; very rare: &lt;1/10,000, not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## 4.9 Overdose

## Symptoms

There is no experience of overdose with Imprida HCT. The major symptom of overdose with valsartan is possibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness. Overdose with amlodipine may result in excessive peripheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia. Marked and potentially prolonged systemic hypotension, including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine.

## Treatment

## Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide

Clinically significant hypotension due to Imprida HCT overdose calls for active cardiovascular support, including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade.

## Amlodipine

If ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered. Administration of activated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine has been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption. Amlodipine is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Valsartan

Valsartan is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis.

## Hydrochlorothiazide

Overdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, hypochloraemia) and hypovolaemia resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle spasms and or accentuate arrhythmia associated with the concomitant use of digitalis glycosides or certain antiarrhythmic medicinal products.

The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by haemodialysis has not been established.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II antagonists, plain (valsartan), combinations with dihydropyridine derivatives (amlodipine) and thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide), ATC code: C09DX01 valsartan, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Imprida HCT combines three antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium antagonist class and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines and hydrochlorothiazide belongs to the thiazide diuretics class of medicines. The combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect. Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Imprida HCT was studied in a double-blind, active controlled study in hypertensive patients. A total of 2,271 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (mean baseline systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 170/107 mmHg) received treatments of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 320 mg/25 mg, amlodipine/valsartan 10 mg/320 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine 25 mg/10 mg. At study initiation patients were assigned lower doses of their treatment combination and were titrated to their full treatment dose by week 2. Medicinal product no longer authorised

At week 8, the mean reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure were 39.7/24.7 mmHg with Imprida HCT, 32.0/19.7 mmHg with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 33.5/21.5 mmHg with amlodipine/valsartan, and 31.5/19.5 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The triple combination therapy was statistically superior to each of the three dual combination treatments in reduction of diastolic and systolic blood pressures. The reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure with Imprida HCT were 7.6/5.0 mmHg greater than with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 6.2/3.3 mmHg greater than with amlodipine/valsartan, and 8.2/5.3 mmHg greater than with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The full blood pressure lowering effect was achieved 2 weeks after being on their maximal dose of Imprida HCT. Statistically greater proportions of patients achieved blood pressure control (&lt;140/90 mmHg) with Imprida HCT (71%) compared to each of the three dual combination therapies (45-54%) (p&lt;0.0001).

In a subgroup of 283 patients focusing on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, clinically and statistically superior reductions in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures were observed with the triple combination compared to valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Amlodipine

The amlodipine component of Imprida HCT inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular resistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels.

Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing.

Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients.

In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and increases in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. Valsartan Valsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively on the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Administration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. In most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs within 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4-6 hours. The antihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration. During repeated administration, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2-4 weeks. Hydrochlorothiazide The site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been shown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the thiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of action of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na + Cl -symporter perhaps by competing for the Cl -site, thereby affecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride excretion to an approximately equal extent, and indirectly, by this diuretic action, reducing plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary potassium loss, and a decrease in serum potassium.

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Imprida HCT in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Linearity

Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide exhibit linear pharmacokinetics.

## Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide

Following oral administration of Imprida HCT in normal healthy adults, peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide are reached in 6-8 hours, 3 hours, and 2 hours, respectively. The rate and extent of absorption of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide from Imprida HCT are the same as when administered as individual dosage forms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Amlodipine

Absorption: After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as between 64% and 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion.

Distribution: Volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that approximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins.

Biotransformation: Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites.

Elimination: Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7-8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine.

Valsartan Absorption: Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan are reached in 2-4 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%. Food decreases exposure (as measured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, although from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted groups. This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food. Distribution: The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is about 17 litres, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is highly bound to serum proteins (94-97%), mainly serum albumin. Biotransformation: Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is recovered as metabolites. A hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations (less than 10% of the valsartan AUC). This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive. Elimination: Valsartan is primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as unchanged drug. Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 l/h and its renal clearance is 0.62 l/h (about 30% of total clearance). The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide Absorption: The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (T max about 2 hours). The increase in mean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute bioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration.

Distribution: The apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is bound to serum proteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in erythrocytes at approximately 3 times the level in plasma.

Biotransformation: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound.

Elimination: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours in the terminal elimination phase. There is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on repeated dosing, and accumulation is minimal when dosed once daily. More than 95% of the absorbed dose is being excreted as unchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of passive filtration and active secretion into the renal tubule.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Paediatric patients (age below 18 years)

No pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population.

## Elderly (age 65 years or over)

Time to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients. In elderly patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) and elimination half-life. Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the young, therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage.

Systemic exposure to valsartan is slightly elevated in the elderly as compared to the young, but this has not been shown to have any clinical significance.

Limited data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and hypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers.

Since the three components are equally well tolerated in younger and elderly patients, normal dose regimens are recommended (see section 4.2).

## Renal impairment

The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. As expected for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no correlation was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan.

Patients with mild to moderate renal impairment may therefore receive the usual initial dose (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

In the presence of renal impairment, mean peak plasma levels and AUC values of hydrochlorothiazide are increased and the urinary excretion rate is reduced. In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide AUC has been observed. In patients with severe renal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been observed. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3).

## Hepatic impairment

Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40-60% in AUC. On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic liver disease, exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy volunteers (matched by age, sex and weight). Due to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide

In a variety of preclinical safety studies conducted in several animal species with amlodipine, valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine/valsartan and amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Imprida HCT), there was no evidence of systemic or target organ toxicity that would adversely affect the development of Imprida HCT for clinical use in humans.

Preclinical safety studies of up to 13 weeks in duration were conducted with amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in rats. The combination resulted in expected reduction of red blood cell mass (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit, and reticulocytes), increase in serum urea, increase in serum creatinine, increase in serum potassium, juxtaglomerular (JG) hyperplasia in the kidney and focal erosions in the glandular stomach in rats. All these changes were reversible after a 4-week recovery period and were considered to be exaggerated pharmacological effects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination was not tested for genotoxicity or carcinogenicity as there was no evidence of any interaction between these substances, which have been on the market for a long time. However, amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide have been tested individually for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity with negative results.

## Amlodipine

## Reproductive toxicology

Reproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of labour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum recommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg.

## Impairment of fertility

There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females 14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg on a mg/m 2 basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine besilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in the number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells.

In non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and evidence of changes in renal haemodynamics (slightly raised plasma urea, and renal tubular hyperplasia and basophilia in males). These doses in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and 18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient).

Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis Rats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. The highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of 10 mg on a mg/m 2 basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. Mutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels. * Based on patient weight of 50 kg Valsartan Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. In rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the last days of gestation and lactation led to lower survival, lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna detachment and ear-canal opening) in the offspring (see section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). Medicinal product no longer authorised

In marmosets at similar doses, the changes were similar though more severe, particularly in the kidney where the changes developed to a nephropathy which included raised urea and creatinine.

Hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also seen in both species. All changes were considered to be caused by the pharmacological action of valsartan which produces prolonged hypotension, particularly in marmosets. For therapeutic doses of valsartan in humans, the hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not seem to have any relevance.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Treatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult patients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled on the combination of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), taken either as three single-component formulations or as a dual-component and a single-component formulation. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The recommended dose of Imprida HCT is one tablet per day, to be taken preferably in the morning. Before switching to Imprida HCT patients should be controlled on stable doses of the monocomponents taken at the same time. The dose of Imprida HCT should be based on the doses of the individual components of the combination at the time of switching. The maximum recommended dose of Imprida HCT is 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

No adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated for use in patients with anuria (see section 4.3) and in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Due to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan and therefore Imprida HCT is not suitable in this group of patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Heart failure and coronary artery disease

There is limited experience with the use of Imprida HCT, particulary at the maximum dose, in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease. Caution is advised in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg.

## Elderly (age 65 years or over)

Caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this patient population are limited.

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of Imprida HCT in the paediatric population (patients below age 18 years) for the indication of essential hypertension.

## Method of administration

Imprida HCT can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water, at the same time of the day and preferably in the morning. 4.3 Contraindications  Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to other sulphonamide derivatives, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the excipients.  Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).  Hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis.  Severe renal impairment (GFR &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ), anuria and patients undergoing dialysis.  Refractory hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, and symptomatic hyperuricaemia. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Sodium- and/or volume-depleted patients Excessive hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, was seen in 1.7% of patients treated with the maximum dose of Imprida HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg) compared to 1.8% of valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (320 mg/25 mg) patients, 0.4% of amlodipine/valsartan (10 mg/320 mg) patients, and 0.2% of hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine (25 mg/10 mg) patients in a controlled trial in patients with moderate to severe uncomplicated hypertension. In sodium-depleted and/or volume-depleted patients, such as those receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Imprida HCT. Imprida HCT should be used only after correction of any pre-existing sodium and/or volume depletion. Medicinal product no longer authorised

If excessive hypotension occurs with Imprida HCT, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been stabilised.

## Serum electrolyte changes

## Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide

In the controlled trial of Imprida HCT, the counteracting effects of valsartan 320 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg on serum potassium approximately balanced each other in many patients. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.

Periodic determination of serum electrolytes and potassium in particular should be performed at appropriate intervals to detect possible electrolyte imbalance, especially in patients with other risk factors such as impaired renal function, treatment with other medicinal products or history of prior electrolyte imbalances.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Valsartan

Concomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) is not recommended. Monitoring of potassium should be undertaken as appropriate.

## Hydrochlorothiazide

Treatment with Imprida HCT should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting hypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate preexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with conditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal (cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide therapy, Imprida HCT should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance.

Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or exacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms (nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide should only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid hyponatraemia develops during Imprida HCT therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until normalisation of natraemia. All patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in electrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. Renal impairment Thiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Imprida HCT is used in patients with renal impairment periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes (including potassium), creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). No dosage adjustment of Imprida HCT is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (GFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ). Renal artery stenosis No data are available on the use of Imprida HCT in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney. Kidney transplantation To date there is no experience of the safe use of Imprida HCT in patients who have had a recent kidney transplantation. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hepatic impairment

Valsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile, whereas amlodipine is extensively metabolised by the liver. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan, and therefore, Imprida HCT is not suitable in this group of patients (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).

## Heart failure and coronary artery disease

As a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar outcomes have been reported with valsartan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New York Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo.

Caution is advised in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in these patient populations is limited.

## Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

As with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients with aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

## Pregnancy

Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6).

## Primary hyperaldosteronism

Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist valsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is not activated. Therefore, Imprida HCT is not recommended in this population.

## Systemic lupus erythematosus

Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate systemic lupus erythematosus.

## Other metabolic disturbances

Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and uric acid. In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents may be required.

Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in symptomatic hyperuricaemia. Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Thiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause intermittant and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing hypercalcaemia. Imprida HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. Serum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Photosensitivity

Cases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If photosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Imprida HCT, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a readministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Acute angle-closure glaucoma

Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to a week of treatment initiation. Untreated acute-angle closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss.

The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatment may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or penicillin allergy.

## General

Caution should be exercised in patients who have shown prior hypersensitivity to other angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide are more likely in patients with allergy and asthma.

Elderly (age 65 years or over) Caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this patient population are limited. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No formal interaction studies with other medicinal products were performed with Imprida HCT. Thus, only information on interactions with other medicinal products that are known for the individual active substances is provided in this section. However, it is important to take into account that Imprida HCT may increase the hypotensive effect of other antihypertensive agents. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

Amlodipine

The safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. In animal studies, reproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3). Use in pregnancy is only recommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk for the mother and foetus.

Effect of the interaction with other medicinal products In monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the following substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide. Some of these substances could interact with the hydrochlorothiazide component of Imprida HCT (see interactions related to HCT). Others In clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, digoxin, warfarin or ciclosporin. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Valsartan

The use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.

Exposure to AIIRAs therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3).

Should exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.

Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

## Hydrochlorothiazide

There is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. Animal studies are insufficient.

Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia.

## Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide

There is no experience on the use of Imprida HCT in pregnant women. Based on the existing data with the components, the use of Imprida HCT is not recommended during first trimester and contraindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

## Breast-feeding

No information is available regarding the use of valsartan and/or amlodipine during breast-feeding. Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing intense diuresis can inhibit milk production. The use of Imprida HCT during breast-feeding is not recommended. If Imprida HCT is used during breast-feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. Alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.

## Fertility

There are no clinical studies on fertility with Imprida HCT.

## Valsartan

Valsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day. This dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Amlodipine

Reversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients treated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of amlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. When driving vehicles or using machines it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

The safety profile of Imprida HCT presented below is based on clinical studies performed with Imprida HCT and the known safety profile of the individual components amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide.

Information on Imprida HCT The safety of Imprida HCT has been evaluated at its maximum dose of 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg in one controlled short-term (8 weeks) clinical study with 2,271 patients, 582 of whom received valsartan in combination with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Adverse reactions were generally mild and transient in nature and only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. In this active controlled clinical trial, the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Imprida HCT were dizziness and hypotension (0.7%). In the 8-week controlled clinical study, no significant new or unexpected adverse reactions were observed with triple therapy treatment compared to the known effects of the monotherapy or dual therapy components. In the 8-week controlled clinical study, changes in laboratory parameters observed with the combination of Imprida HCT were minor and consistent with the pharmacological mechanism of action of the monotherapy agents. The presence of valsartan in the triple combination attenuated the hypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide. The following adverse reactions, listed by MedDRA System Organ Class and frequency, concern Imprida HCT (amlodipine/valsartan/HCT) and amlodipine, valsartan and HCT individually. Very common: ≥1/10; common: ≥1/100 to &lt;1/10; uncommon: ≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100; rare: ≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000; very rare: &lt;1/10,000, not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## 4.9 Overdose

## Symptoms

There is no experience of overdose with Imprida HCT. The major symptom of overdose with valsartan is possibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness. Overdose with amlodipine may result in excessive peripheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia. Marked and potentially prolonged systemic hypotension, including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine.

## Treatment

## Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide

Clinically significant hypotension due to Imprida HCT overdose calls for active cardiovascular support, including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade.

## Amlodipine

If ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered. Administration of activated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine has been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption. Amlodipine is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Valsartan

Valsartan is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis.

## Hydrochlorothiazide

Overdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, hypochloraemia) and hypovolaemia resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle spasms and or accentuate arrhythmia associated with the concomitant use of digitalis glycosides or certain antiarrhythmic medicinal products.

The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by haemodialysis has not been established.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II antagonists, plain (valsartan), combinations with dihydropyridine derivatives (amlodipine) and thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide), ATC code: C09DX01 valsartan, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Imprida HCT combines three antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium antagonist class and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines and hydrochlorothiazide belongs to the thiazide diuretics class of medicines. The combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect. Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Imprida HCT was studied in a double-blind, active controlled study in hypertensive patients. A total of 2,271 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (mean baseline systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 170/107 mmHg) received treatments of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 320 mg/25 mg, amlodipine/valsartan 10 mg/320 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine 25 mg/10 mg. At study initiation patients were assigned lower doses of their treatment combination and were titrated to their full treatment dose by week 2. Medicinal product no longer authorised

At week 8, the mean reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure were 39.7/24.7 mmHg with Imprida HCT, 32.0/19.7 mmHg with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 33.5/21.5 mmHg with amlodipine/valsartan, and 31.5/19.5 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The triple combination therapy was statistically superior to each of the three dual combination treatments in reduction of diastolic and systolic blood pressures. The reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure with Imprida HCT were 7.6/5.0 mmHg greater than with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 6.2/3.3 mmHg greater than with amlodipine/valsartan, and 8.2/5.3 mmHg greater than with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The full blood pressure lowering effect was achieved 2 weeks after being on their maximal dose of Imprida HCT. Statistically greater proportions of patients achieved blood pressure control (&lt;140/90 mmHg) with Imprida HCT (71%) compared to each of the three dual combination therapies (45-54%) (p&lt;0.0001).

In a subgroup of 283 patients focusing on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, clinically and statistically superior reductions in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures were observed with the triple combination compared to valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Amlodipine

The amlodipine component of Imprida HCT inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular resistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels.

Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing.

Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients.

In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and increases in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. Valsartan Valsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively on the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Administration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. In most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs within 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4-6 hours. The antihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration. During repeated administration, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2-4 weeks. Hydrochlorothiazide The site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been shown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the thiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of action of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na + Cl -symporter perhaps by competing for the Cl -site, thereby affecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride excretion to an approximately equal extent, and indirectly, by this diuretic action, reducing plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary potassium loss, and a decrease in serum potassium.

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Imprida HCT in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Linearity

Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide exhibit linear pharmacokinetics.

## Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide

Following oral administration of Imprida HCT in normal healthy adults, peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide are reached in 6-8 hours, 3 hours, and 2 hours, respectively. The rate and extent of absorption of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide from Imprida HCT are the same as when administered as individual dosage forms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Amlodipine

Absorption: After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as between 64% and 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion.

Distribution: Volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that approximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins.

Biotransformation: Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites.

Elimination: Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7-8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine.

Valsartan Absorption: Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan are reached in 2-4 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%. Food decreases exposure (as measured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, although from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted groups. This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food. Distribution: The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is about 17 litres, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is highly bound to serum proteins (94-97%), mainly serum albumin. Biotransformation: Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is recovered as metabolites. A hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations (less than 10% of the valsartan AUC). This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive. Elimination: Valsartan is primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as unchanged drug. Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 l/h and its renal clearance is 0.62 l/h (about 30% of total clearance). The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide Absorption: The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (T max about 2 hours). The increase in mean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute bioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration.

Distribution: The apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is bound to serum proteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in erythrocytes at approximately 3 times the level in plasma.

Biotransformation: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound.

Elimination: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours in the terminal elimination phase. There is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on repeated dosing, and accumulation is minimal when dosed once daily. More than 95% of the absorbed dose is being excreted as unchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of passive filtration and active secretion into the renal tubule.

## Special populations

## Paediatric patients (age below 18 years)

No pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population.

## Elderly (age 65 years or over)

Time to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients. In elderly patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) and elimination half-life. Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the young, therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage.

Systemic exposure to valsartan is slightly elevated in the elderly as compared to the young, but this has not been shown to have any clinical significance.

Limited data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and hypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers.

Since the three components are equally well tolerated in younger and elderly patients, normal dose regimens are recommended (see section 4.2).

## Renal impairment

The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. As expected for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no correlation was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan.

Patients with mild to moderate renal impairment may therefore receive the usual initial dose (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

In the presence of renal impairment, mean peak plasma levels and AUC values of hydrochlorothiazide are increased and the urinary excretion rate is reduced. In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide AUC has been observed. In patients with severe renal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been observed. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3).

## Hepatic impairment

Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40-60% in AUC. On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic liver disease, exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy volunteers (matched by age, sex and weight). Due to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).

In a variety of preclinical safety studies conducted in several animal species with amlodipine, valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine/valsartan and amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Imprida HCT), there was no evidence of systemic or target organ toxicity that would adversely affect the development of Imprida HCT for clinical use in humans.

Preclinical safety studies of up to 13 weeks in duration were conducted with amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in rats. The combination resulted in expected reduction of red blood cell mass (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit, and reticulocytes), increase in serum urea, increase in serum creatinine, increase in serum potassium, juxtaglomerular (JG) hyperplasia in the kidney and focal erosions in the glandular stomach in rats. All these changes were reversible after a 4-week recovery period and were considered to be exaggerated pharmacological effects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination was not tested for genotoxicity or carcinogenicity as there was no evidence of any interaction between these substances, which have been on the market for a long time. However, amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide have been tested individually for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity with negative results.

## Amlodipine

## Reproductive toxicology

Reproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of labour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum recommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg.

## Impairment of fertility

There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females 14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg on a mg/m 2 basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine besilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in the number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells.

In non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and evidence of changes in renal haemodynamics (slightly raised plasma urea, and renal tubular hyperplasia and basophilia in males). These doses in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and 18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient).

Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis Rats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. The highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of 10 mg on a mg/m 2 basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. Mutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels. * Based on patient weight of 50 kg Valsartan Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. In rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the last days of gestation and lactation led to lower survival, lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna detachment and ear-canal opening) in the offspring (see section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). Medicinal product no longer authorised

In marmosets at similar doses, the changes were similar though more severe, particularly in the kidney where the changes developed to a nephropathy which included raised urea and creatinine.

Hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also seen in both species. All changes were considered to be caused by the pharmacological action of valsartan which produces prolonged hypotension, particularly in marmosets. For therapeutic doses of valsartan in humans, the hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not seem to have any relevance.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Imprida HCT 5 mg/160 mg/25 mg film-coated tablets

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each film-coated tablet contains 5 mg of amlodipine (as amlodipine besylate), 160 mg of valsartan, and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide.

For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Film-coated tablet (tablet) Yellow, ovaloid, biconvex tablets with bevelled edge, debossed 'NVR' on one side and 'VEL' on the other side. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Treatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult patients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled on the combination of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), taken either as three single-component formulations or as a dual-component and a single-component formulation. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The recommended dose of Imprida HCT is one tablet per day, to be taken preferably in the morning. Before switching to Imprida HCT patients should be controlled on stable doses of the monocomponents taken at the same time. The dose of Imprida HCT should be based on the doses of the individual components of the combination at the time of switching. The maximum recommended dose of Imprida HCT is 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

No adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated for use in patients with anuria (see section 4.3) and in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Due to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan and therefore Imprida HCT is not suitable in this group of patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Heart failure and coronary artery disease

There is limited experience with the use of Imprida HCT, particulary at the maximum dose, in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease. Caution is advised in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg.

## Elderly (age 65 years or over)

Caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this patient population are limited.

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of Imprida HCT in the paediatric population (patients below age 18 years) for the indication of essential hypertension.

## Method of administration

Imprida HCT can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water, at the same time of the day and preferably in the morning. 4.3 Contraindications  Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to other sulphonamide derivatives, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the excipients.  Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).  Hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis.  Severe renal impairment (GFR &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ), anuria and patients undergoing dialysis.  Refractory hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, and symptomatic hyperuricaemia. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Sodium- and/or volume-depleted patients Excessive hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, was seen in 1.7% of patients treated with the maximum dose of Imprida HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg) compared to 1.8% of valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (320 mg/25 mg) patients, 0.4% of amlodipine/valsartan (10 mg/320 mg) patients, and 0.2% of hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine (25 mg/10 mg) patients in a controlled trial in patients with moderate to severe uncomplicated hypertension. In sodium-depleted and/or volume-depleted patients, such as those receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Imprida HCT. Imprida HCT should be used only after correction of any pre-existing sodium and/or volume depletion. Medicinal product no longer authorised

If excessive hypotension occurs with Imprida HCT, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been stabilised.

## Serum electrolyte changes

## Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide

In the controlled trial of Imprida HCT, the counteracting effects of valsartan 320 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg on serum potassium approximately balanced each other in many patients. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.

Periodic determination of serum electrolytes and potassium in particular should be performed at appropriate intervals to detect possible electrolyte imbalance, especially in patients with other risk factors such as impaired renal function, treatment with other medicinal products or history of prior electrolyte imbalances.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Valsartan

Concomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) is not recommended. Monitoring of potassium should be undertaken as appropriate.

## Hydrochlorothiazide

Treatment with Imprida HCT should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting hypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate preexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with conditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal (cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide therapy, Imprida HCT should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance.

Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or exacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms (nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide should only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid hyponatraemia develops during Imprida HCT therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until normalisation of natraemia. All patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in electrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. Renal impairment Thiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Imprida HCT is used in patients with renal impairment periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes (including potassium), creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). No dosage adjustment of Imprida HCT is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (GFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ). Renal artery stenosis No data are available on the use of Imprida HCT in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney. Kidney transplantation To date there is no experience of the safe use of Imprida HCT in patients who have had a recent kidney transplantation. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hepatic impairment

Valsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile, whereas amlodipine is extensively metabolised by the liver. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan, and therefore, Imprida HCT is not suitable in this group of patients (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).

## Heart failure and coronary artery disease

As a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar outcomes have been reported with valsartan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New York Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo.

Caution is advised in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in these patient populations is limited.

## Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

As with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients with aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

## Pregnancy

Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6).

## Primary hyperaldosteronism

Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist valsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is not activated. Therefore, Imprida HCT is not recommended in this population.

## Systemic lupus erythematosus

Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate systemic lupus erythematosus.

## Other metabolic disturbances

Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and uric acid. In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents may be required.

Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in symptomatic hyperuricaemia. Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Thiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause intermittant and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing hypercalcaemia. Imprida HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. Serum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Photosensitivity

Cases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If photosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Imprida HCT, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a readministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Acute angle-closure glaucoma

Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to a week of treatment initiation. Untreated acute-angle closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss.

The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatment may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or penicillin allergy.

## General

Caution should be exercised in patients who have shown prior hypersensitivity to other angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide are more likely in patients with allergy and asthma.

Elderly (age 65 years or over) Caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this patient population are limited. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No formal interaction studies with other medicinal products were performed with Imprida HCT. Thus, only information on interactions with other medicinal products that are known for the individual active substances is provided in this section. However, it is important to take into account that Imprida HCT may increase the hypotensive effect of other antihypertensive agents. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

Amlodipine

The safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. In animal studies, reproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3). Use in pregnancy is only recommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk for the mother and foetus.

In monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the following substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide. Some of these substances could interact with the hydrochlorothiazide component of Imprida HCT (see interactions related to HCT). Others In clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, digoxin, warfarin or ciclosporin. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Valsartan

The use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.

Exposure to AIIRAs therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3).

Should exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.

Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

## Hydrochlorothiazide

There is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. Animal studies are insufficient.

Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia.

## Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide

There is no experience on the use of Imprida HCT in pregnant women. Based on the existing data with the components, the use of Imprida HCT is not recommended during first trimester and contraindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

## Breast-feeding

No information is available regarding the use of valsartan and/or amlodipine during breast-feeding. Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing intense diuresis can inhibit milk production. The use of Imprida HCT during breast-feeding is not recommended. If Imprida HCT is used during breast-feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. Alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.

## Fertility

There are no clinical studies on fertility with Imprida HCT.

## Valsartan

Valsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day. This dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Amlodipine

Reversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients treated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of amlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. When driving vehicles or using machines it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

The safety profile of Imprida HCT presented below is based on clinical studies performed with Imprida HCT and the known safety profile of the individual components amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide.

Information on Imprida HCT The safety of Imprida HCT has been evaluated at its maximum dose of 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg in one controlled short-term (8 weeks) clinical study with 2,271 patients, 582 of whom received valsartan in combination with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Adverse reactions were generally mild and transient in nature and only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. In this active controlled clinical trial, the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Imprida HCT were dizziness and hypotension (0.7%). In the 8-week controlled clinical study, no significant new or unexpected adverse reactions were observed with triple therapy treatment compared to the known effects of the monotherapy or dual therapy components. In the 8-week controlled clinical study, changes in laboratory parameters observed with the combination of Imprida HCT were minor and consistent with the pharmacological mechanism of action of the monotherapy agents. The presence of valsartan in the triple combination attenuated the hypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide. The following adverse reactions, listed by MedDRA System Organ Class and frequency, concern Imprida HCT (amlodipine/valsartan/HCT) and amlodipine, valsartan and HCT individually. Very common: ≥1/10; common: ≥1/100 to &lt;1/10; uncommon: ≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100; rare: ≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000; very rare: &lt;1/10,000, not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## 4.9 Overdose

## Symptoms

There is no experience of overdose with Imprida HCT. The major symptom of overdose with valsartan is possibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness. Overdose with amlodipine may result in excessive peripheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia. Marked and potentially prolonged systemic hypotension, including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine.

## Treatment

## Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide

Clinically significant hypotension due to Imprida HCT overdose calls for active cardiovascular support, including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade.

## Amlodipine

If ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered. Administration of activated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine has been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption. Amlodipine is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Valsartan

Valsartan is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis.

## Hydrochlorothiazide

Overdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, hypochloraemia) and hypovolaemia resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle spasms and or accentuate arrhythmia associated with the concomitant use of digitalis glycosides or certain antiarrhythmic medicinal products.

The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by haemodialysis has not been established.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II antagonists, plain (valsartan), combinations with dihydropyridine derivatives (amlodipine) and thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide), ATC code: C09DX01 valsartan, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Imprida HCT combines three antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium antagonist class and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines and hydrochlorothiazide belongs to the thiazide diuretics class of medicines. The combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect. Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Imprida HCT was studied in a double-blind, active controlled study in hypertensive patients. A total of 2,271 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (mean baseline systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 170/107 mmHg) received treatments of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 320 mg/25 mg, amlodipine/valsartan 10 mg/320 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine 25 mg/10 mg. At study initiation patients were assigned lower doses of their treatment combination and were titrated to their full treatment dose by week 2. Medicinal product no longer authorised

At week 8, the mean reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure were 39.7/24.7 mmHg with Imprida HCT, 32.0/19.7 mmHg with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 33.5/21.5 mmHg with amlodipine/valsartan, and 31.5/19.5 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The triple combination therapy was statistically superior to each of the three dual combination treatments in reduction of diastolic and systolic blood pressures. The reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure with Imprida HCT were 7.6/5.0 mmHg greater than with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 6.2/3.3 mmHg greater than with amlodipine/valsartan, and 8.2/5.3 mmHg greater than with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The full blood pressure lowering effect was achieved 2 weeks after being on their maximal dose of Imprida HCT. Statistically greater proportions of patients achieved blood pressure control (&lt;140/90 mmHg) with Imprida HCT (71%) compared to each of the three dual combination therapies (45-54%) (p&lt;0.0001).

In a subgroup of 283 patients focusing on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, clinically and statistically superior reductions in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures were observed with the triple combination compared to valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Amlodipine

The amlodipine component of Imprida HCT inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular resistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels.

Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing.

Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients.

In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and increases in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. Valsartan Valsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively on the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Administration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. In most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs within 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4-6 hours. The antihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration. During repeated administration, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2-4 weeks. Hydrochlorothiazide The site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been shown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the thiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of action of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na + Cl -symporter perhaps by competing for the Cl -site, thereby affecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride excretion to an approximately equal extent, and indirectly, by this diuretic action, reducing plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary potassium loss, and a decrease in serum potassium.

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Imprida HCT in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Linearity

Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide exhibit linear pharmacokinetics.

## Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide

Following oral administration of Imprida HCT in normal healthy adults, peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide are reached in 6-8 hours, 3 hours, and 2 hours, respectively. The rate and extent of absorption of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide from Imprida HCT are the same as when administered as individual dosage forms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Amlodipine

Absorption: After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as between 64% and 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion.

Distribution: Volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that approximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins.

Biotransformation: Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites.

Elimination: Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7-8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine.

Valsartan Absorption: Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan are reached in 2-4 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%. Food decreases exposure (as measured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, although from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted groups. This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food. Distribution: The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is about 17 litres, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is highly bound to serum proteins (94-97%), mainly serum albumin. Biotransformation: Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is recovered as metabolites. A hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations (less than 10% of the valsartan AUC). This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive. Elimination: Valsartan is primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as unchanged drug. Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 l/h and its renal clearance is 0.62 l/h (about 30% of total clearance). The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide Absorption: The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (T max about 2 hours). The increase in mean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute bioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration.

Distribution: The apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is bound to serum proteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in erythrocytes at approximately 3 times the level in plasma.

Biotransformation: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound.

Elimination: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours in the terminal elimination phase. There is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on repeated dosing, and accumulation is minimal when dosed once daily. More than 95% of the absorbed dose is being excreted as unchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of passive filtration and active secretion into the renal tubule.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Paediatric patients (age below 18 years)

No pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population.

## Elderly (age 65 years or over)

Time to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients. In elderly patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) and elimination half-life. Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the young, therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage.

Systemic exposure to valsartan is slightly elevated in the elderly as compared to the young, but this has not been shown to have any clinical significance.

Limited data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and hypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers.

Since the three components are equally well tolerated in younger and elderly patients, normal dose regimens are recommended (see section 4.2).

## Renal impairment

The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. As expected for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no correlation was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan.

Patients with mild to moderate renal impairment may therefore receive the usual initial dose (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

In the presence of renal impairment, mean peak plasma levels and AUC values of hydrochlorothiazide are increased and the urinary excretion rate is reduced. In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide AUC has been observed. In patients with severe renal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been observed. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3).

## Hepatic impairment

Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40-60% in AUC. On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic liver disease, exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy volunteers (matched by age, sex and weight). Due to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide

In a variety of preclinical safety studies conducted in several animal species with amlodipine, valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine/valsartan and amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Imprida HCT), there was no evidence of systemic or target organ toxicity that would adversely affect the development of Imprida HCT for clinical use in humans.

Preclinical safety studies of up to 13 weeks in duration were conducted with amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in rats. The combination resulted in expected reduction of red blood cell mass (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit, and reticulocytes), increase in serum urea, increase in serum creatinine, increase in serum potassium, juxtaglomerular (JG) hyperplasia in the kidney and focal erosions in the glandular stomach in rats. All these changes were reversible after a 4-week recovery period and were considered to be exaggerated pharmacological effects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination was not tested for genotoxicity or carcinogenicity as there was no evidence of any interaction between these substances, which have been on the market for a long time. However, amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide have been tested individually for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity with negative results.

## Amlodipine

## Reproductive toxicology

Reproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of labour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum recommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg.

## Impairment of fertility

There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females 14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg on a mg/m 2 basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine besilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in the number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells.

In non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and evidence of changes in renal haemodynamics (slightly raised plasma urea, and renal tubular hyperplasia and basophilia in males). These doses in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and 18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient).

Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis Rats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. The highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of 10 mg on a mg/m 2 basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. Mutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels. * Based on patient weight of 50 kg Valsartan Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. In rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the last days of gestation and lactation led to lower survival, lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna detachment and ear-canal opening) in the offspring (see section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). Medicinal product no longer authorised

In marmosets at similar doses, the changes were similar though more severe, particularly in the kidney where the changes developed to a nephropathy which included raised urea and creatinine.

Hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also seen in both species. All changes were considered to be caused by the pharmacological action of valsartan which produces prolonged hypotension, particularly in marmosets. For therapeutic doses of valsartan in humans, the hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not seem to have any relevance.

Imprida HCT 10 mg/160 mg/25 mg film-coated tablets

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each film-coated tablet contains 10 mg of amlodipine (as amlodipine besylate), 160 mg of valsartan, and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide.

For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Film-coated tablet (tablet) Brown-yellow, ovaloid, biconvex tablets with bevelled edge, debossed 'NVR' on one side and 'VHL' on the other side. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Treatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult patients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled on the combination of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), taken either as three single-component formulations or as a dual-component and a single-component formulation. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The recommended dose of Imprida HCT is one tablet per day, to be taken preferably in the morning. Before switching to Imprida HCT patients should be controlled on stable doses of the monocomponents taken at the same time. The dose of Imprida HCT should be based on the doses of the individual components of the combination at the time of switching. The maximum recommended dose of Imprida HCT is 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

No adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated for use in patients with anuria (see section 4.3) and in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Due to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan and therefore Imprida HCT is not suitable in this group of patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Heart failure and coronary artery disease

There is limited experience with the use of Imprida HCT, particulary at the maximum dose, in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease. Caution is advised in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg.

## Elderly (age 65 years or over)

Caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this patient population are limited.

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of Imprida HCT in the paediatric population (patients below age 18 years) for the indication of essential hypertension.

## Method of administration

Imprida HCT can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water, at the same time of the day and preferably in the morning. 4.3 Contraindications  Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to other sulphonamide derivatives, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the excipients.  Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).  Hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis.  Severe renal impairment (GFR &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ), anuria and patients undergoing dialysis.  Refractory hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, and symptomatic hyperuricaemia. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Sodium- and/or volume-depleted patients Excessive hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, was seen in 1.7% of patients treated with the maximum dose of Imprida HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg) compared to 1.8% of valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (320 mg/25 mg) patients, 0.4% of amlodipine/valsartan (10 mg/320 mg) patients, and 0.2% of hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine (25 mg/10 mg) patients in a controlled trial in patients with moderate to severe uncomplicated hypertension. In sodium-depleted and/or volume-depleted patients, such as those receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Imprida HCT. Imprida HCT should be used only after correction of any pre-existing sodium and/or volume depletion. Medicinal product no longer authorised

If excessive hypotension occurs with Imprida HCT, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been stabilised.

## Serum electrolyte changes

## Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide

In the controlled trial of Imprida HCT, the counteracting effects of valsartan 320 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg on serum potassium approximately balanced each other in many patients. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.

Periodic determination of serum electrolytes and potassium in particular should be performed at appropriate intervals to detect possible electrolyte imbalance, especially in patients with other risk factors such as impaired renal function, treatment with other medicinal products or history of prior electrolyte imbalances.

Concomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) is not recommended. Monitoring of potassium should be undertaken as appropriate.

## Hydrochlorothiazide

Treatment with Imprida HCT should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting hypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate preexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with conditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal (cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide therapy, Imprida HCT should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance.

Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or exacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms (nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide should only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid hyponatraemia develops during Imprida HCT therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until normalisation of natraemia. All patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in electrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. Renal impairment Thiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Imprida HCT is used in patients with renal impairment periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes (including potassium), creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). No dosage adjustment of Imprida HCT is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (GFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ). Renal artery stenosis No data are available on the use of Imprida HCT in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney. Kidney transplantation To date there is no experience of the safe use of Imprida HCT in patients who have had a recent kidney transplantation. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hepatic impairment

Valsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile, whereas amlodipine is extensively metabolised by the liver. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan, and therefore, Imprida HCT is not suitable in this group of patients (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).

## Heart failure and coronary artery disease

As a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar outcomes have been reported with valsartan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New York Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo.

Caution is advised in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in these patient populations is limited.

## Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

As with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients with aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

## Pregnancy

Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6).

## Primary hyperaldosteronism

Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist valsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is not activated. Therefore, Imprida HCT is not recommended in this population.

## Systemic lupus erythematosus

Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate systemic lupus erythematosus.

## Other metabolic disturbances

Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and uric acid. In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents may be required.

Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in symptomatic hyperuricaemia. Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Thiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause intermittant and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing hypercalcaemia. Imprida HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. Serum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

## Photosensitivity

Cases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If photosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Imprida HCT, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a readministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Acute angle-closure glaucoma

Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to a week of treatment initiation. Untreated acute-angle closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss.

The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatment may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or penicillin allergy.

## General

Caution should be exercised in patients who have shown prior hypersensitivity to other angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide are more likely in patients with allergy and asthma.

Elderly (age 65 years or over) Caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this patient population are limited. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No formal interaction studies with other medicinal products were performed with Imprida HCT. Thus, only information on interactions with other medicinal products that are known for the individual active substances is provided in this section. However, it is important to take into account that Imprida HCT may increase the hypotensive effect of other antihypertensive agents. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

Amlodipine

The safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. In animal studies, reproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3). Use in pregnancy is only recommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk for the mother and foetus.

Effect of the interaction with other medicinal products In monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the following substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide. Some of these substances could interact with the hydrochlorothiazide component of Imprida HCT (see interactions related to HCT). Others In clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, digoxin, warfarin or ciclosporin. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Valsartan

The use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.

Exposure to AIIRAs therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3).

Should exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.

Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

## Hydrochlorothiazide

There is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. Animal studies are insufficient.

Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia.

## Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide

There is no experience on the use of Imprida HCT in pregnant women. Based on the existing data with the components, the use of Imprida HCT is not recommended during first trimester and contraindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

## Breast-feeding

No information is available regarding the use of valsartan and/or amlodipine during breast-feeding. Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing intense diuresis can inhibit milk production. The use of Imprida HCT during breast-feeding is not recommended. If Imprida HCT is used during breast-feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. Alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.

## Fertility

There are no clinical studies on fertility with Imprida HCT.

## Valsartan

Valsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day. This dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Amlodipine

Reversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients treated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of amlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. When driving vehicles or using machines it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

Information on Imprida HCT The safety of Imprida HCT has been evaluated at its maximum dose of 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg in one controlled short-term (8 weeks) clinical study with 2,271 patients, 582 of whom received valsartan in combination with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Adverse reactions were generally mild and transient in nature and only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. In this active controlled clinical trial, the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Imprida HCT were dizziness and hypotension (0.7%). In the 8-week controlled clinical study, no significant new or unexpected adverse reactions were observed with triple therapy treatment compared to the known effects of the monotherapy or dual therapy components. In the 8-week controlled clinical study, changes in laboratory parameters observed with the combination of Imprida HCT were minor and consistent with the pharmacological mechanism of action of the monotherapy agents. The presence of valsartan in the triple combination attenuated the hypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide. The following adverse reactions, listed by MedDRA System Organ Class and frequency, concern Imprida HCT (amlodipine/valsartan/HCT) and amlodipine, valsartan and HCT individually. Very common: ≥1/10; common: ≥1/100 to &lt;1/10; uncommon: ≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100; rare: ≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000; very rare: &lt;1/10,000, not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## 4.9 Overdose

## Symptoms

There is no experience of overdose with Imprida HCT. The major symptom of overdose with valsartan is possibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness. Overdose with amlodipine may result in excessive peripheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia. Marked and potentially prolonged systemic hypotension, including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine.

## Treatment

## Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide

Clinically significant hypotension due to Imprida HCT overdose calls for active cardiovascular support, including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade.

## Amlodipine

If ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered. Administration of activated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine has been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption. Amlodipine is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Valsartan

Valsartan is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis.

## Hydrochlorothiazide

Overdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, hypochloraemia) and hypovolaemia resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle spasms and or accentuate arrhythmia associated with the concomitant use of digitalis glycosides or certain antiarrhythmic medicinal products.

The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by haemodialysis has not been established.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II antagonists, plain (valsartan), combinations with dihydropyridine derivatives (amlodipine) and thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide), ATC code: C09DX01 valsartan, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Imprida HCT combines three antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium antagonist class and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines and hydrochlorothiazide belongs to the thiazide diuretics class of medicines. The combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect. Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Imprida HCT was studied in a double-blind, active controlled study in hypertensive patients. A total of 2,271 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (mean baseline systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 170/107 mmHg) received treatments of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 320 mg/25 mg, amlodipine/valsartan 10 mg/320 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine 25 mg/10 mg. At study initiation patients were assigned lower doses of their treatment combination and were titrated to their full treatment dose by week 2. Medicinal product no longer authorised

At week 8, the mean reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure were 39.7/24.7 mmHg with Imprida HCT, 32.0/19.7 mmHg with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 33.5/21.5 mmHg with amlodipine/valsartan, and 31.5/19.5 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The triple combination therapy was statistically superior to each of the three dual combination treatments in reduction of diastolic and systolic blood pressures. The reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure with Imprida HCT were 7.6/5.0 mmHg greater than with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 6.2/3.3 mmHg greater than with amlodipine/valsartan, and 8.2/5.3 mmHg greater than with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The full blood pressure lowering effect was achieved 2 weeks after being on their maximal dose of Imprida HCT. Statistically greater proportions of patients achieved blood pressure control (&lt;140/90 mmHg) with Imprida HCT (71%) compared to each of the three dual combination therapies (45-54%) (p&lt;0.0001).

In a subgroup of 283 patients focusing on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, clinically and statistically superior reductions in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures were observed with the triple combination compared to valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine.

## Amlodipine

The amlodipine component of Imprida HCT inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular resistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels.

Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing.

Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients.

In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and increases in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. Valsartan Valsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively on the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Administration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. In most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs within 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4-6 hours. The antihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration. During repeated administration, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2-4 weeks. Hydrochlorothiazide The site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been shown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the thiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of action of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na + Cl -symporter perhaps by competing for the Cl -site, thereby affecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride excretion to an approximately equal extent, and indirectly, by this diuretic action, reducing plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary potassium loss, and a decrease in serum potassium.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Linearity

Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide exhibit linear pharmacokinetics.

## Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide

Following oral administration of Imprida HCT in normal healthy adults, peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide are reached in 6-8 hours, 3 hours, and 2 hours, respectively. The rate and extent of absorption of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide from Imprida HCT are the same as when administered as individual dosage forms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Amlodipine

Absorption: After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as between 64% and 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion.

Distribution: Volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that approximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins.

Biotransformation: Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites.

Elimination: Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7-8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine.

Valsartan Absorption: Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan are reached in 2-4 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%. Food decreases exposure (as measured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, although from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted groups. This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food. Distribution: The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is about 17 litres, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is highly bound to serum proteins (94-97%), mainly serum albumin. Biotransformation: Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is recovered as metabolites. A hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations (less than 10% of the valsartan AUC). This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive. Elimination: Valsartan is primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as unchanged drug. Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 l/h and its renal clearance is 0.62 l/h (about 30% of total clearance). The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide Absorption: The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (T max about 2 hours). The increase in mean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute bioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration.

Distribution: The apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is bound to serum proteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in erythrocytes at approximately 3 times the level in plasma.

Biotransformation: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound.

Elimination: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours in the terminal elimination phase. There is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on repeated dosing, and accumulation is minimal when dosed once daily. More than 95% of the absorbed dose is being excreted as unchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of passive filtration and active secretion into the renal tubule.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Paediatric patients (age below 18 years)

No pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population.

## Elderly (age 65 years or over)

Time to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients. In elderly patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) and elimination half-life. Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the young, therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage.

Systemic exposure to valsartan is slightly elevated in the elderly as compared to the young, but this has not been shown to have any clinical significance.

Limited data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and hypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers.

Since the three components are equally well tolerated in younger and elderly patients, normal dose regimens are recommended (see section 4.2).

## Renal impairment

The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. As expected for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no correlation was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan.

Patients with mild to moderate renal impairment may therefore receive the usual initial dose (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

In the presence of renal impairment, mean peak plasma levels and AUC values of hydrochlorothiazide are increased and the urinary excretion rate is reduced. In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide AUC has been observed. In patients with severe renal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been observed. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3).

## Hepatic impairment

Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40-60% in AUC. On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic liver disease, exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy volunteers (matched by age, sex and weight). Due to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide

In a variety of preclinical safety studies conducted in several animal species with amlodipine, valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine/valsartan and amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Imprida HCT), there was no evidence of systemic or target organ toxicity that would adversely affect the development of Imprida HCT for clinical use in humans.

Preclinical safety studies of up to 13 weeks in duration were conducted with amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in rats. The combination resulted in expected reduction of red blood cell mass (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit, and reticulocytes), increase in serum urea, increase in serum creatinine, increase in serum potassium, juxtaglomerular (JG) hyperplasia in the kidney and focal erosions in the glandular stomach in rats. All these changes were reversible after a 4-week recovery period and were considered to be exaggerated pharmacological effects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination was not tested for genotoxicity or carcinogenicity as there was no evidence of any interaction between these substances, which have been on the market for a long time. However, amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide have been tested individually for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity with negative results.

## Amlodipine

## Reproductive toxicology

Reproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of labour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum recommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg.

## Impairment of fertility

There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females 14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg on a mg/m 2 basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine besilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in the number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells.

In non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and evidence of changes in renal haemodynamics (slightly raised plasma urea, and renal tubular hyperplasia and basophilia in males). These doses in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and 18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient).

Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis Rats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. The highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of 10 mg on a mg/m 2 basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. Mutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels. * Based on patient weight of 50 kg Valsartan Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. In rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the last days of gestation and lactation led to lower survival, lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna detachment and ear-canal opening) in the offspring (see section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient). Medicinal product no longer authorised

In marmosets at similar doses, the changes were similar though more severe, particularly in the kidney where the changes developed to a nephropathy which included raised urea and creatinine.

Hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also seen in both species. All changes were considered to be caused by the pharmacological action of valsartan which produces prolonged hypotension, particularly in marmosets. For therapeutic doses of valsartan in humans, the hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not seem to have any relevance.

For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Film-coated tablet (tablet) Brown-yellow, ovaloid, biconvex tablets with bevelled edge, debossed 'NVR' on one side and 'VFL' on the other side. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Treatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult patients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled on the combination of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), taken either as three single-component formulations or as a dual-component and a single-component formulation. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The recommended dose of Imprida HCT is one tablet per day, to be taken preferably in the morning. Before switching to Imprida HCT patients should be controlled on stable doses of the monocomponents taken at the same time. The dose of Imprida HCT should be based on the doses of the individual components of the combination at the time of switching. The maximum recommended dose of Imprida HCT is 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

No adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated for use in patients with anuria (see section 4.3) and in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Due to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan and therefore Imprida HCT is not suitable in this group of patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Heart failure and coronary artery disease

There is limited experience with the use of Imprida HCT, particulary at the maximum dose, in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease. Caution is advised in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg.

## Elderly (age 65 years or over)

Caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this patient population are limited.

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of Imprida HCT in the paediatric population (patients below age 18 years) for the indication of essential hypertension.

## Method of administration

Imprida HCT can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water, at the same time of the day and preferably in the morning. 4.3 Contraindications  Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to other sulphonamide derivatives, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the excipients.  Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).  Hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis.  Severe renal impairment (GFR &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ), anuria and patients undergoing dialysis.  Refractory hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, and symptomatic hyperuricaemia. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Sodium- and/or volume-depleted patients Excessive hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, was seen in 1.7% of patients treated with the maximum dose of Imprida HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg) compared to 1.8% of valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (320 mg/25 mg) patients, 0.4% of amlodipine/valsartan (10 mg/320 mg) patients, and 0.2% of hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine (25 mg/10 mg) patients in a controlled trial in patients with moderate to severe uncomplicated hypertension. In sodium-depleted and/or volume-depleted patients, such as those receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Imprida HCT. Imprida HCT should be used only after correction of any pre-existing sodium and/or volume depletion. Medicinal product no longer authorised

If excessive hypotension occurs with Imprida HCT, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been stabilised.

## Serum electrolyte changes

## Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide

In the controlled trial of Imprida HCT, the counteracting effects of valsartan 320 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg on serum potassium approximately balanced each other in many patients. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.

Periodic determination of serum electrolytes and potassium in particular should be performed at appropriate intervals to detect possible electrolyte imbalance, especially in patients with other risk factors such as impaired renal function, treatment with other medicinal products or history of prior electrolyte imbalances.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Valsartan

Concomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) is not recommended. Monitoring of potassium should be undertaken as appropriate.

## Hydrochlorothiazide

Treatment with Imprida HCT should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting hypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate preexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with conditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal (cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide therapy, Imprida HCT should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance.

Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or exacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms (nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide should only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid hyponatraemia develops during Imprida HCT therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until normalisation of natraemia. All patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in electrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. Renal impairment Thiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Imprida HCT is used in patients with renal impairment periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes (including potassium), creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3). No dosage adjustment of Imprida HCT is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (GFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ). Renal artery stenosis No data are available on the use of Imprida HCT in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney. Kidney transplantation To date there is no experience of the safe use of Imprida HCT in patients who have had a recent kidney transplantation. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hepatic impairment

Valsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile, whereas amlodipine is extensively metabolised by the liver. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan, and therefore, Imprida HCT is not suitable in this group of patients (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).

## Heart failure and coronary artery disease

As a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar outcomes have been reported with valsartan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New York Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo.

Caution is advised in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in these patient populations is limited.

## Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

As with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients with aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

## Pregnancy

Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6).

## Primary hyperaldosteronism

Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist valsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is not activated. Therefore, Imprida HCT is not recommended in this population.

## Systemic lupus erythematosus

Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate systemic lupus erythematosus.

## Other metabolic disturbances

Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and uric acid. In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents may be required.

Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in symptomatic hyperuricaemia. Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Thiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause intermittant and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing hypercalcaemia. Imprida HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. Serum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Photosensitivity

Cases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If photosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Imprida HCT, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a readministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Acute angle-closure glaucoma

Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to a week of treatment initiation. Untreated acute-angle closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss.

The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatment may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or penicillin allergy.

## General

Caution should be exercised in patients who have shown prior hypersensitivity to other angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide are more likely in patients with allergy and asthma.

Elderly (age 65 years or over) Caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended in elderly patients, particularly at the maximum dose of Imprida HCT, 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, since available data in this patient population are limited. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No formal interaction studies with other medicinal products were performed with Imprida HCT. Thus, only information on interactions with other medicinal products that are known for the individual active substances is provided in this section. However, it is important to take into account that Imprida HCT may increase the hypotensive effect of other antihypertensive agents. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

Amlodipine

The safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. In animal studies, reproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3). Use in pregnancy is only recommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk for the mother and foetus.

In monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the following substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide. Some of these substances could interact with the hydrochlorothiazide component of Imprida HCT (see interactions related to HCT). In clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, digoxin, warfarin or ciclosporin. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Valsartan

The use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.

Exposure to AIIRAs therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3).

Should exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.

Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

## Hydrochlorothiazide

There is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. Animal studies are insufficient.

Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia.

## Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide

There is no experience on the use of Imprida HCT in pregnant women. Based on the existing data with the components, the use of Imprida HCT is not recommended during first trimester and contraindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

## Breast-feeding

No information is available regarding the use of valsartan and/or amlodipine during breast-feeding. Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing intense diuresis can inhibit milk production. The use of Imprida HCT during breast-feeding is not recommended. If Imprida HCT is used during breast-feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. Alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.

## Fertility

There are no clinical studies on fertility with Imprida HCT.

## Valsartan

Valsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day. This dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Amlodipine

Reversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients treated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of amlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. When driving vehicles or using machines it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

The safety profile of Imprida HCT presented below is based on clinical studies performed with Imprida HCT and the known safety profile of the individual components amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide.

Information on Imprida HCT The safety of Imprida HCT has been evaluated at its maximum dose of 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg in one controlled short-term (8 weeks) clinical study with 2,271 patients, 582 of whom received valsartan in combination with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Adverse reactions were generally mild and transient in nature and only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. In this active controlled clinical trial, the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Imprida HCT were dizziness and hypotension (0.7%). In the 8-week controlled clinical study, no significant new or unexpected adverse reactions were observed with triple therapy treatment compared to the known effects of the monotherapy or dual therapy components. In the 8-week controlled clinical study, changes in laboratory parameters observed with the combination of Imprida HCT were minor and consistent with the pharmacological mechanism of action of the monotherapy agents. The presence of valsartan in the triple combination attenuated the hypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide. The following adverse reactions, listed by MedDRA System Organ Class and frequency, concern Imprida HCT (amlodipine/valsartan/HCT) and amlodipine, valsartan and HCT individually. Very common: ≥1/10; common: ≥1/100 to &lt;1/10; uncommon: ≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100; rare: ≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000; very rare: &lt;1/10,000, not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## 4.9 Overdose

## Symptoms

There is no experience of overdose with Imprida HCT. The major symptom of overdose with valsartan is possibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness. Overdose with amlodipine may result in excessive peripheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia. Marked and potentially prolonged systemic hypotension, including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine.

## Treatment

## Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide

Clinically significant hypotension due to Imprida HCT overdose calls for active cardiovascular support, including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade.

## Amlodipine

If ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered. Administration of activated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine has been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption. Amlodipine is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Valsartan

Valsartan is unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis.

## Hydrochlorothiazide

Overdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, hypochloraemia) and hypovolaemia resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle spasms and or accentuate arrhythmia associated with the concomitant use of digitalis glycosides or certain antiarrhythmic medicinal products.

The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by haemodialysis has not been established.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II antagonists, plain (valsartan), combinations with dihydropyridine derivatives (amlodipine) and thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide), ATC code: C09DX01 valsartan, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Imprida HCT combines three antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium antagonist class and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines and hydrochlorothiazide belongs to the thiazide diuretics class of medicines. The combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect. Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Imprida HCT was studied in a double-blind, active controlled study in hypertensive patients. A total of 2,271 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (mean baseline systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 170/107 mmHg) received treatments of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 320 mg/25 mg, amlodipine/valsartan 10 mg/320 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine 25 mg/10 mg. At study initiation patients were assigned lower doses of their treatment combination and were titrated to their full treatment dose by week 2. Medicinal product no longer authorised

At week 8, the mean reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure were 39.7/24.7 mmHg with Imprida HCT, 32.0/19.7 mmHg with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 33.5/21.5 mmHg with amlodipine/valsartan, and 31.5/19.5 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The triple combination therapy was statistically superior to each of the three dual combination treatments in reduction of diastolic and systolic blood pressures. The reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure with Imprida HCT were 7.6/5.0 mmHg greater than with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 6.2/3.3 mmHg greater than with amlodipine/valsartan, and 8.2/5.3 mmHg greater than with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The full blood pressure lowering effect was achieved 2 weeks after being on their maximal dose of Imprida HCT. Statistically greater proportions of patients achieved blood pressure control (&lt;140/90 mmHg) with Imprida HCT (71%) compared to each of the three dual combination therapies (45-54%) (p&lt;0.0001).

In a subgroup of 283 patients focusing on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, clinically and statistically superior reductions in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures were observed with the triple combination compared to valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Amlodipine

The amlodipine component of Imprida HCT inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular resistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels.

Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing.

Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients.

In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and increases in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. Valsartan Valsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively on the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Administration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. In most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs within 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4-6 hours. The antihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration. During repeated administration, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2-4 weeks. Hydrochlorothiazide The site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been shown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the thiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of action of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na + Cl -symporter perhaps by competing for the Cl -site, thereby affecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride excretion to an approximately equal extent, and indirectly, by this diuretic action, reducing plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary potassium loss, and a decrease in serum potassium.

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Imprida HCT in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Linearity

Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide exhibit linear pharmacokinetics.

## Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide

Following oral administration of Imprida HCT in normal healthy adults, peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide are reached in 6-8 hours, 3 hours, and 2 hours, respectively. The rate and extent of absorption of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide from Imprida HCT are the same as when administered as individual dosage forms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Amlodipine

Absorption: After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as between 64% and 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion.

Distribution: Volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that approximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins.

Biotransformation: Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites.

Elimination: Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7-8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine.

Valsartan Absorption: Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan are reached in 2-4 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%. Food decreases exposure (as measured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, although from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted groups. This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food. Distribution: The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is about 17 litres, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is highly bound to serum proteins (94-97%), mainly serum albumin. Biotransformation: Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is recovered as metabolites. A hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations (less than 10% of the valsartan AUC). This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive. Elimination: Valsartan is primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as unchanged drug. Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 l/h and its renal clearance is 0.62 l/h (about 30% of total clearance). The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide Absorption: The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (T max about 2 hours). The increase in mean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute bioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration.

Distribution: The apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is bound to serum proteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in erythrocytes at approximately 3 times the level in plasma.

Biotransformation: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound.

Elimination: Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours in the terminal elimination phase. There is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on repeated dosing, and accumulation is minimal when dosed once daily. More than 95% of the absorbed dose is being excreted as unchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of passive filtration and active secretion into the renal tubule.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Paediatric patients (age below 18 years)

No pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population.

## Elderly (age 65 years or over)

Time to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients. In elderly patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) and elimination half-life. Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the young, therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage.

Systemic exposure to valsartan is slightly elevated in the elderly as compared to the young, but this has not been shown to have any clinical significance.

Limited data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and hypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers.

Since the three components are equally well tolerated in younger and elderly patients, normal dose regimens are recommended (see section 4.2).

## Renal impairment

The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. As expected for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no correlation was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan.

Patients with mild to moderate renal impairment may therefore receive the usual initial dose (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

In the presence of renal impairment, mean peak plasma levels and AUC values of hydrochlorothiazide are increased and the urinary excretion rate is reduced. In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide AUC has been observed. In patients with severe renal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been observed. Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, anuria or undergoing dialysis (see section 4.3).

## Hepatic impairment

Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40-60% in AUC. On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic liver disease, exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy volunteers (matched by age, sex and weight). Due to the valsartan component, Imprida HCT is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide

In a variety of preclinical safety studies conducted in several animal species with amlodipine, valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine/valsartan and amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Imprida HCT), there was no evidence of systemic or target organ toxicity that would adversely affect the development of Imprida HCT for clinical use in humans.

Preclinical safety studies of up to 13 weeks in duration were conducted with amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in rats. The combination resulted in expected reduction of red blood cell mass (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit, and reticulocytes), increase in serum urea, increase in serum creatinine, increase in serum potassium, juxtaglomerular (JG) hyperplasia in the kidney and focal erosions in the glandular stomach in rats. All these changes were reversible after a 4-week recovery period and were considered to be exaggerated pharmacological effects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination was not tested for genotoxicity or carcinogenicity as there was no evidence of any interaction between these substances, which have been on the market for a long time. However, amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide have been tested individually for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity with negative results.

## Amlodipine

## Reproductive toxicology

Reproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of labour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum recommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg.

## Impairment of fertility

There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females 14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg on a mg/m 2 basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine besilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in the number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells.

In non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and evidence of changes in renal haemodynamics (slightly raised plasma urea, and renal tubular hyperplasia and basophilia in males). These doses in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and 18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient).

Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis Rats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. The highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of 10 mg on a mg/m 2 basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. Mutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels. * Based on patient weight of 50 kg Valsartan Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. In rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the last days of gestation and lactation led to lower survival, lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna detachment and ear-canal opening) in the offspring (see section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient).

In marmosets at similar doses, the changes were similar though more severe, particularly in the kidney where the changes developed to a nephropathy which included raised urea and creatinine.

Hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also seen in both species. All changes were considered to be caused by the pharmacological action of valsartan which produces prolonged hypotension, particularly in marmosets. For therapeutic doses of valsartan in humans, the hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not seem to have any relevance.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours.

## In this leaflet:

1. What Imprida HCT is and what it is used for 2. Before you take Imprida HCT 3. How to take Imprida HCT 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Imprida HCT 6. Further information 1. WHAT IMPRIDA HCT IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR Imprida HCT tablets contain three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide. All of these substances help to control high blood pressure.  Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called 'calcium channel blockers'. Amlodipine stops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall, which stops the blood vessels from tightening.  Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called 'angiotensin-II receptor antagonists'. Angiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the blood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II.  Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of substances called 'thiazide diuretics'. Hydrochlorothiazide increases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. As a result of all three mechanisms, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. Imprida HCT is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients who are already taking amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide and who may benefit from taking one tablet containing all three substances. Medicinal product no longer authorised

If you think you may be allergic, do not take Imprida HCT and talk to your doctor.
-  if you have liver disease, destruction of the small bile ducts within the liver (biliary cirrhosis) leading to the build up of bile in the liver (cholestasis).

This is a disease in which the adrenal glands make too much of the hormone aldosterone If this applies to you, the use of Imprida HCT is not recommended.  if you suffer from a disease called systemic lupus erythematosus (also called 'lupus' or 'SLE').  if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood).  if you have high levels of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood.  if you experience skin reactions such as rash after sun exposure.  if you had an allergic reaction to other high blood pressure medicines or diuretics (a type of medicine also known as 'water tablets'), especially if you suffer from asthma and allergies  if you have been sick (vomiting or diarrhoea).  if you experience dizziness and/or fainting during treatment with Imprida HCT, tell your doctor as soon as possible.  if you experience a decrease in vision or eye pain.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Taking Imprida HCT with food and drink

You can take Imprida HCT with or without food. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should not be consumed by people who are taking Imprida HCT. This is because grapefruit and grapefruit juice can lead to an increase in the blood levels of the active substance amlodipine, which can cause an unpredictable increase in the blood pressure lowering effect of Imprida HCT.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

## Pregnancy

You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally advise you to stop taking Imprida HCT before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Imprida HCT. Imprida HCT is not recommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.

Breast-feeding Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Imprida HCT is not recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is a newborn, or was born prematurely. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. Driving and using machines As with many other medicines used to treat high blood pressure, this medicine may make you feel dizzy. If you experience this symptom, do not drive or use tools or machines. 3. HOW TO TAKE IMPRIDA HCT Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you are not sure. This will help you get the best results and lower the risk of side effects. The usual dose of Imprida HCT is one tablet per day.  It is best to take the tablet at the same time each day.

## PACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER

## Imprida HCT 10 mg/160 mg/12.5 mg film-coated tablets

amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours.
- -If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

## In this leaflet:

1. What Imprida HCT is and what it is used for 2. Before you take Imprida HCT 3. How to take Imprida HCT 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Imprida HCT 6. Further information 1. WHAT IMPRIDA HCT IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR Imprida HCT tablets contain three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide. All of these substances help to control high blood pressure.  Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called 'calcium channel blockers'. Amlodipine stops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall, which stops the blood vessels from tightening.  Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called 'angiotensin-II receptor antagonists'. Angiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the blood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II.  Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of substances called 'thiazide diuretics'. Hydrochlorothiazide increases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. As a result of all three mechanisms, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. Imprida HCT is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients who are already taking amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide and who may benefit from taking one tablet containing all three substances. Medicinal product no longer authorised

This is a disease in which the adrenal glands make too much of the hormone aldosterone If this applies to you, the use of Imprida HCT is not recommended.  if you suffer from a disease called systemic lupus erythematosus (also called 'lupus' or 'SLE').  if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood).  if you have high levels of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood.  if you experience skin reactions such as rash after sun exposure.  if you had an allergic reaction to other high blood pressure medicines or diuretics (a type of medicine also known as 'water tablets'), especially if you suffer from asthma and allergies  if you have been sick (vomiting or diarrhoea).  if you experience dizziness and/or fainting during treatment with Imprida HCT, tell your doctor as soon as possible.  if you experience a decrease in vision or eye pain.

## PACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER

## Imprida HCT 5 mg/160 mg/25 mg film-coated tablets

amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours.

## In this leaflet:

1. What Imprida HCT is and what it is used for 2. Before you take Imprida HCT 3. How to take Imprida HCT 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Imprida HCT 6. Further information 1. WHAT IMPRIDA HCT IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR Imprida HCT tablets contain three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide. All of these substances help to control high blood pressure.  Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called 'calcium channel blockers'. Amlodipine stops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall, which stops the blood vessels from tightening.  Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called 'angiotensin-II receptor antagonists'. Angiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the blood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II.  Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of substances called 'thiazide diuretics'. Hydrochlorothiazide increases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. As a result of all three mechanisms, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. Imprida HCT is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients who are already taking amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide and who may benefit from taking one tablet containing all three substances. Medicinal product no longer authorised

This is a disease in which the adrenal glands make too much of the hormone aldosterone If this applies to you, the use of Imprida HCT is not recommended.  if you suffer from a disease called systemic lupus erythematosus (also called 'lupus' or 'SLE').  if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood).  if you have high levels of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood.  if you experience skin reactions such as rash after sun exposure.  if you had an allergic reaction to other high blood pressure medicines or diuretics (a type of medicine also known as 'water tablets'), especially if you suffer from asthma and allergies  if you have been sick (vomiting or diarrhoea).  if you experience dizziness and/or fainting during treatment with Imprida HCT, tell your doctor as soon as possible.  if you experience a decrease in vision or eye pain.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

## Pregnancy

You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally advise you to stop taking Imprida HCT before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Imprida HCT.

If you experience this symptom, do not drive or use tools or machines. 3. HOW TO TAKE IMPRIDA HCT Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Always take this medicine, even if you are feeling well

## In this leaflet:

1. What Imprida HCT is and what it is used for 2. Before you take Imprida HCT 3. How to take Imprida HCT 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Imprida HCT 6. Further information 1. WHAT IMPRIDA HCT IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR Imprida HCT tablets contain three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide. All of these substances help to control high blood pressure.  Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called 'calcium channel blockers'. Amlodipine stops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall, which stops the blood vessels from tightening.  Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called 'angiotensin-II receptor antagonists'. Angiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the blood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II.  Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of substances called 'thiazide diuretics'. Hydrochlorothiazide increases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. As a result of all three mechanisms, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. Imprida HCT is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients who are already taking amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide and who may benefit from taking one tablet containing all three substances.

If you experience this symptom, do not drive or use tools or machines. 3. HOW TO TAKE IMPRIDA HCT Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>
