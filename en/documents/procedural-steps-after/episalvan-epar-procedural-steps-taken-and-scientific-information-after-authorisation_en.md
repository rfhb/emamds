| R/0018                | Renewal of the marketing authorisation.                                                                                                 | 23/07/2020         | 17/09/2020 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL longer | Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of Episalvan in the approved indication remains favourable, but recommended that one additional five-year renewal be required based on the following pharmacovigilance grounds: For Episalvan limited safety information is available because of limited exposure due to limited marketing of the medicinal product. As of the DLP, Episalvan has been placed on the market in only one EU country. Episalvan has not yet been commercially launched or placed on the market in any other EU country and thus, no post-authorisation data are currently available. No data on post-authorisation use in special populations were reported as no non-interventional studies, including market research and registries, have been conducted with Episalvan since the granting of the marketing authorization. Therefore, based upon the limited safety profile of Episalvan, the CHMP concluded that the MAHshould submit one additional renewal application in 5 years time. authorised |
