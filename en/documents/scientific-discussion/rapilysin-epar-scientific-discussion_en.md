## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This module reflects the initial scientific discussion and scientific discussion on procedures which have been finalised before 1 September 2003. For scientific information on procedures after this date please refer to module 8B.

## 1. Introduction

Rapilysin 10 U contains the active substance reteplase, an unglycosylated recombinant mutant of tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA) produced in Escherichia coli .

This medicinal product is intended to be used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Plasminogen  activators  catalyse  the  cleavage  of  endogenous  plasminogen  to  generate  plasmin,  an unspecific  proteinase  that  degrades  the  fibrin  matrix  of  a  thrombus.  The  natural  t-PA  is  a  serine protease synthesised by endothelial cells and secreted as a single or double chain molecule. Each 527 amino acid chain has a molecular mass of 65000. The natural t-PA is a poor plasminogen activator in the  absence  of  fibrin.  t-PA  binds  to  fibrin  via  lysin  binding  sites  and  activates  bound  plasminogen several hundred-fold more rapidly than it activates plasminogen in the blood circulation. Clearance of t-PA is primarily made by hepatic metabolism and its half-life is about 3 minutes.

Reteplase  is  a  'fibrin-selective'  recombinant  plasminogen  activator  derived  from  human  t-PA  and containing  a  355  amino  acid  chain.  Three  major  domains  of  the  molecule  have  been  removed:  the amino terminal finger domain which is involved in the high affinity binding to fibrin, the epidermal growth factor domain and the kringle 1 domain. Only the kringle 2 domain which is involved in fibrin selectivity and the catalytic site are preserved. Removal of 3 major domains in the t-PA molecule and the  lack  of  glycosylation  would  be  expected  to  modify the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic characteristics.

The rationale behind the development of reteplase was to find a faster thrombolytic agent compared to approved dosage regimens of standard thrombolytics without increasing the risk of thrombolysis. The second aim was to find a substance with a longer effective half-life as compared to approved dosage regimens of standard thrombolytics in order to facilitate the method of administration.

Thrombolysis  is  the  first  choice  therapy  of  AMI.  Placebo-controlled  studies  have  shown  that thrombolytic therapy reduces mortality in AMI patients with symptoms onset of less than 12 hours as compared to non-thrombolytic therapy.

The pharmaceutical company initially responsible for this medicinal product, Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, transferred the MA to Roche Registration Limited (United Kingdom) on 8 April 1999.

## 2. Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Rapilysin is presented in lyophilised form in a 20 ml glass vial with a chlorobutyl rubber closure and an aluminium cap. The new formulation for the finished product comprises:

- 2 vials containing each 10 U reteplase as active substance and tranexamic acid, di-potassiumhydrogen phosphate, phosphoric acid and polysorbate 80 as excipients,
- 2 pre-filled syringes with 10 ml of water for injection,
- 2 reconstitution devices and 2 needles.

The  TAPS-formulation  contains  tranexamic  acid  instead  of  arginine  as  solubilizing  agent.  The abbreviation stands for tranexamic Acid, Phosphate, Sucrose.

The  new  formulation  exhibits  new  properties  in  comparison  with  the  current  one:  on  stability, dissolution time and higher concentration thus optimizing the manufacturing process.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As  a  consequence  of  this  change,  the  SPC,  PIL  and  the  labels  have  been  revised.  For  the  finished product, the specifications and routine methods, the manufacturing process including validation, and the stability report had to be adapted accordingly

## Manufacturing process and process validation

The proposed (TAPS) formulation has been considered acceptable. The consequential changes to inprocess  controls  and  specifications  for  the  finished  product  are  justified  and  acceptable.  The validation/revalidation  of  the  analytical  methods  was  done  according  to  relevant  guidelines  and  is acceptable. The changes in the manufacturing process resulting from the new formulation are justified, validated and acceptable. A shelf-life of 12 months at 25°C is covered by the submitted stability data and should be granted unless stability studies for a longer period of time are provided.

The reconstituted drug solution is chemically stable for 4 hours. Immediate use after reconstitution is recommended.

The manufacturing process essentially remains the same. Three major adaptations are introduced:

- -Transfer  of  the  arginine/phosphate  drug  substance  solution  into  the  TAPS-formulation  via diafiltration  over  10kD  crossflow  membranes,  after  addition  of  polysorbate  80  and  pH adjustment.
- -Omission of the additional filtration step before preparing the drug product solution (please refer to the Variation type I adopted in September CPMP 1997)
- -Adaptation  of  the  freeze-drying  conditions  to  the  physico-chemical  properties  of  the  new formulation.

The  entire  manufacturing  process  is  monitored  by  appropriate  in-process  controls  and  in-processspecification limits and, where appropriate, validated.

At the time of the submission of the variation Type II 'New TAPS-Formulation'-EMEA Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/II/04-, only one year stability data for the final product were available. In the meantime the 24-month stability data to support the extension of the shelf life of the final product to 24 months were established and have been accepted by the CPMP.

## Original dossier submitted in 1995

The  key  manufacturing  steps  for  Rapilyisin  as  described  in  the  original  dossier  submitted  by  the applicant are summarised as follow:

Cell Line Production -  To produce a modified recombinant t-PA molecule (reteplase) harboring the domains K2 and P, the host cell  E.  coli  K12  is  used.  The  coding  sequence  was  integrated  into  the expression vector and the cell was cotransformed with the helper vector which improves the yield of level of reteplase and reduces the risk of translation errors.

The plasmids were introduced into E. coli by the calcium chloride technique. The expression of the protein  is  induced  by  addition  of  lactose.  It  leads  to  a  non-glycosylated  protein  which  accumulates inside the prokaryotic cells as inactive aggregates or inclusion bodies.

The rationale behind the construction of the plasmids and the production strain is convincing. Selection and characterisation of the host cell, the expression vector and the helper vector have been described satisfactorily.  The  characterisation  is  adequate  and  the  stability  throughout  the  fermentation  process has been demonstrated.

Cell Banks -  The description of the preparation and characterisation of the master cell bank (MCB) and the manufacturer's working cell bank (MWCB) have been provided. The identities of both cell banks are verified by analysing the genetic markers, antibiotic resistances, restriction enzyme analysis and expression of reteplase. The nucleotide sequences of the two independent colonies of the MWBC have  been  determined.  Using  Eur.  Ph.  methods,  the  absence  of  bacteria,  yeast  and  fungi  are demonstrated. The absence of bacteriophages is confirmed by using the plaque assay.

The  preparation  of  the  cell  banks,  their  size  and  their  storage  ensure  the  continuous  production  of reteplase.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Fermentation and Harvesting -  Fermentation  process  takes  place on a scale of 1000 L production fermentor.  A  vial  of  the  MWCB  is  successively  expanded  into  100  ml  and  10  L  cultures  (both containing  ampicillin  and  kanamycin)  for  inoculation  of  the  production  fermentor.  At  the  end  of fermentation,  harvesting  and  isolation  of  inclusion  bodies  are  performed  and  then  followed  by  the refolding of the protein.

According to the Opinion of the CPMP on the granting of the MA dated May 23, 1996, Boehringer Mannheim  agreed  to  submit  to  the  EMEA  experimental  evidence  for  the  need  for  the  antibiotics ampicillin  and  kanamycin  in  the  preculture.  The  justification  provided  was  found  satisfactory. However,  the  company  announced  the  submission  of  a  variation  in  order  to  produce  the  active substance without using antibiotics. On the basis of the data shown that the precultures of the E. coli host  cells  can  be  cultivated  without  antibiotics  and  the  supporting  documentation  this  variation  was accepted by the CPMP.

Refolding Process -  It  is  a  crucial  step  of  the  production procedure to transform the protein into its active state. The inclusion bodies are solubilised and denatured under reducing conditions. Then the reducing  agent  is  removed  under  denaturing  conditions.  Cysteine  residues  are  modified  with glutathione,  producing  a  mixed  disulfide  solution  which  is  used  for  the  refolding  reaction.  The renaturation  and  purification  process  is  shown  to  be  consistent.  The  validation  of  the  process  is described in sufficient detail and the rationale behind the development is clearly documented.

Purification  Procedures  They  are  essential  for  isolation  of  the  active  form  of  reteplase  and elimination of incorrectly folded structures. They consist mainly of 4 steps: acidification plus filtration, affinity  chromatography  on  Erythrina  trypsin  inhibitor  (ETI)-Sepharose  and  two  ion-exchange chromatographies.

Boehringer Mannheim applied for a minor change in the main purification step in the manufacturing process of the acive substance reteplase, the chromatography by the Erythrina trypsin inhibitor (ETI) as ligand purified from seeds of several Erythrina species. The change accepted by the CPMP refers to the use recombinant produced ETI (recSerETI) using the same E. coli production strain as is used to produce reteplase.

The equivalence of the recSerETI and ETI Sepharose column is demonstrated. The reteplase bulk drug substance purified on the new recSerETI Sepharose column is shown to be equivalent as compared to reteplase purified on the ETI Sepharose column.

Due to the need of additional full-scale fermentation runs the company has provided a time schedule for submission.

The active ingredient is obtained after concentration, diafiltration and sterile filtration. The bulk drug substance contains reteplase in an arginine buffer.. As mentioned before following the new formulation there  is  a  transfer  of  the  arginine/phosphate  drug  substance  solution  into  the  TAPS-formulation  via diafiltration over 10kD crossflow membranes, after addition of polysorbate 80 and pH adjustment.

The  specification  and  routine  control  tests  are  satisfactory.  Reteplase  has  been  well  characterised. Validation of the production has been provided and it assures consistency of the yield, degree of purity and quality of the active ingredient. For potency testing, the determination of amidolytic activity and the clot lysis assay were adequately validated.

Finished Product - Release specifications for reteplase 10U lyophilisate are in reasonable accordance with the specifications for the bulk drug substance regarding the protein parameters.

The development of the formulation was well documented and justified. The manufacturing process is well  validated  and  its  consistency  has  been  demonstrated.  All  methods  used  have  been  adequately validated.

Following  the  Marketing  Authorisation  of  Rapilysin,  a  new  improved  formulation  for  the  finished product with Tranexamic Acid intended to improve the manufacturing process was introduced by the MAH in March 1998.

Stability - Based on the full results obtained to date of the first Marketing authorisation, which cover 18  months  of  stability  testing,  a  shelf  life  of  2  years  at  a  temperature  of  2 ° C  to  25 ° C  has  been

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

requested  and  accepted.  The  company  provided  additional  satisfactory  data  justifying  the  accepted shelf-life on a post-authorisation phase.

On the basis of the new formulation the stability is referred in the initial part of the pharmaceutical section.

The  reconstituted  product  is  chemically  stable  for  4  hours  at  30 ° C  but  immediate  use  after reconstitution is recommended.

After the granting of the Marketing Authorisation the MAH claimed for an extension of the shelf-life of the active substance reteplase from 24 to 36 months with the currently accepted storage conditions at -70 ° C. On the basis of the data presented the variation applied was accepted.

## 3. Toxico-pharmacological aspects

Additional studies in this section have been provided by the MAH after the Marketing authorisation to prove the equivalence of the TAPs formulation vs the arginine-phosphate formulation.

The  experiments  undertaken  to  demonstrate  local  tolerance  following  intravenous  injections  and  to prove identical fibrinolytic efficacy without any side effects upon hemostatic variables were performed in animals. The test strategies used were very closely comparable to thrombolytic treatment of patients suffering from AMI. Several animal experiments demonstrated equivalence to the standard argininephosphate-formulation in every aspect tested. It may be concluded from the animal experiments, that there is no difference between the two formulations with respect to efficacy and variables of adverse clinical  outcome.  The  new  TAPS-formulation  has  shown  to  be  as  safe  and  effective  as  the  current formulation in the animals studied.

Based on the submitted data the CPMP has considered that the new formulation could be accepted without further clinical studies and an unfavourable effect of tranexamic acid is extremely improbable. The CPMP has considered that sufficient assurance has been given to prove that TAPS formulation does  not  alter  the  risk/benefit  ration  for  Reteplase.  However,  the  company  should  provide  two additional in vitro studies as an undertaking measure after the adoption of this variation.

## Original dossier submitted in 1995

The definition of the dose used during the preclinical and clinical development of reteplase was MU/kg or  kU/kg.  However,  unit  definition  is  in  the  process  of  being  changed  as  follows:  1MU  (old)=1U (new), 1kU (old)= 1mU (new). Throughout this report, old values have been used.

## Pharmacodynamics

## Primary pharmacology

The pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated that reteplase is a fibrin selective plasminogen activator, possibly interacting with fibrin via the lysine binding site. It had a relative, i.e. dose-dependent, fibrin selectivity similar to that of alteplase.

The  in  vitro  fibrin  binding  was  30%  of  that  of  alteplase.  In  the  absence  of  fibrin,  similar  enzyme kinetics towards plasminogen were observed for reteplase and alteplase. In the presence of fibrin, the catalytic activity of reteplase was enhanced (approximately 300 times) although being lower than that of alteplase during the same experimental conditions.

The in vitro clot lysis activity of reteplase was lower than that of alteplase but a higher potency of reteplase  was  demonstrated  in  'in  vivo'  models  (jugular  vein  thrombosis  model  in  rabbits,  canine model of coronary artery thrombosis), possibly due to its lower clearance rate.

In the canine model of coronary artery thrombosis, the double bolus injection regimen was shown to be superior to a single bolus dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety pharmacology

Studies  monitoring  the  major  organ  systems  revealed  no  unexpected  effects.  In  conscious  dogs, hypotension  occurred  at  1.4  MU/kg.  Prolongation  of  bleeding  time  occurred  at  doses  above  0.2 MU/kg, possibly related to inhibition of platelet  aggregation.  As expected for a variant of a human protein, guinea pigs and dogs formed specific antibodies to reteplase.

No relevant drug interaction studies have been performed with reteplase.

## Pharmacokinetics

Tissue distribution was investigated in rats with 125 I-reteplase. Out of the total radioactivity, 16% (36% when  using  a  lysosome  specific  label)  was  detected  in  liver  and  20%  in  kidneys  although  only marginal amounts of radiolabel were recovered in bladder and urine. No studies of the distribution of reteplase in pregnant animals or into breast milk have been performed.

In rats, liver and kidneys were the main organs of active uptake and degradation of reteplase but about 30% of the compound was inactivated by protease inhibitors in plasma. Studies in rats with impaired renal  and/or  hepatic  function  indicated  that  the  renal  elimination  was  of  more  importance  than  the hepatic.

The single dose pharmacokinetics of reteplase were studied in different animal species including rat, dog,  rabbit  and  non-human  primate  by  monitoring  changes  of  enzymatic  activity  in  plasma.  These studies demonstrated that clearance rates and t1/2 were similar in all animal species (3-8 ml/min/kg and 7-15  min;  respectively).  Furthermore,  these  parameters  were  comparable  to  data  from  healthy volunteers and AMI patients (clearance: 5-6 ml/min/kg; t1/2: 11-13 min). In animals, reteplase had a 3-8 fold lower total plasma clearance and thus, a longer t1/2 than alteplase.

Pharmacokinetics following repeated doses have not been investigated in animals.

## Toxicology

The toxicological programme included studies of single and 14 days repeat dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity, local tolerance and a complete battery of genotoxicity tests. Studies were performed in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice.

Single dose toxicity studies have been performed in rabbits (intravenous doses up to 4.2 MU/kg) as well as in rats  and cynomolgus monkeys (intravenous doses up to 8.4 MU/kg). In these studies, no mortalities occurred. Major signs of toxicity were transient sedation.

Repeated  dose  toxicity was  studied  in  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys  during  14  days  administration  of intravenous  doses  up  to  3-5  fold  the  therapeutic  dose.  Main  findings  were  hypotension  and haemorrhages at the injection site which both possibly were related to the pharmacological effect of reteplase. Furthermore, as predicted for this type of product, dogs and monkeys showed immunogenic reactions.

Reproductive toxicity was studied in rats, monitoring effects on fertility and reproductive performance (Segment I) and following administration during the organogenetic period (Segment II). These studies did not reveal significant effects on fertility or signs of embryotoxicity. In rabbits, only a limited dose-range finding segment II study was conducted which resulted in vaginal bleeding, reduced pregnancy rate and abortions. Perinatal and postnatal toxicity (Segment III) was not investigated.

Based on these data, adequate information has been included in the Summary  of  Product Characteristics.

Genotoxicity was  monitored  in  an  adequate  battery  of  in  vitro  (gene  mutations  in  bacteria  and mammalian cells, chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells) and in vivo tests (micronucleus test in mice and rats). Reteplase showed no genotoxic potential in these studies.

Carcinogenicity studies  were  not  performed,  which  is  acceptable  considering  the  intended  use  of reteplase

Local  tolerance in  rabbits  given  intravenous  injections  of  clinically  relevant  concentrations  was acceptable while local irritation was observed after paravenous injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A phase 1 environmental risk assessment revealed a negligible risk to the environment and therefore no further studies were required.

The  pharmacological  studies  seemed  to  support  an  effect  of  reteplase  relevant  for  the  claimed indication. Enzymatic characteristics and fibrin binding potential were elucidated.

In the canine model of coronary artery thrombosis, the double bolus injection regimen was shown to be superior to a single bolus dose. Furthermore, in vivo data indicated a higher thrombolytic potency of reteplase with respect to alteplase, possibly due to its lower clearance rate.

Major  findings  in  the  toxicity  studies  were  hypotension,  related  to  the  pharmacological  effect  of reteplase and formation of antibodies, which is expected for this type of product.

Safety factors based on dose comparisons were in the same range as those established for alteplase.

Questions raised regarding product interactions, in vivo inhibition, effects on platelet function, lack of repeated dose pharmacokinetic data and regarding reproductive toxicity were sufficiently addressed by the applicant.

## 4. Clinical aspects

The clinical trials with reteplase were performed in compliance with the European Good Clinical Practice guideline. As the use of placebo in AMI studies would be unethical the studies on reteplase were either uncontrolled or active controlled with streptokinase or alteplase (rt-PA).

## Human pharmacology

The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of reteplase have been evaluated predominantly in open uncontrolled studies involving 70 humans.

## Pharmacodynamics

Study M1 was an open trial involving 3 healthy volunteers per dose. The trial evaluated tolerability and effects on the haemostatic system of single bolus intravenous injections of reteplase (doses ranged from 0.1125 MU to 5.5 MU).

Study M2 was  an  open  label  trial  involving  6  healthy  volunteers  per  dosage  group  -5  allocated  to treatment  and  1  allocated  to  placebo  -  evaluating  the  effects  of  several  single  bolus  intravenous injections of reteplase. Doses ranged from 0.9 mg to 7.2 mg (17 mg are equivalent to approximately 10 MU).

Study  N1 was  a  single-blind  cross-over  trial  involving  7  healthy  volunteers.  The  trial  evaluated tolerability and effects on the haemostatic system of a 6 MU single intravenous reteplase injection.

The results of these pharmacodynamic studies showed that single bolus doses of reteplase up to 6 MU produced  only  minor  changes  in  the  hemostatic  system.  Laboratory  parameters  did  not  show  any specific changes which could be attributed to reteplase. No formation of antibodies was observed up to 4  weeks  after  reteplase  administration.  No  effects  on  blood  pressure,  heart  rate,  cardiac  rhythm  or ECG-intervals  were  observed.  Adverse  events  in  healthy  volunteers  were  rare  and  not  clinically relevant.

Studies P1 (single bolus dose of 10 MU and 15 MU), P2 (10 MU +5 MU double bolus dose) and P3 (15 MU single bolus dose, 10 MU +5 MU double bolus dose, 10 MU +10 MU double bolus dose) aimed  to  provide  information  on  pharmacodynamics,  pharmacokinetics  and  dose  response  in  AMI patients. A description of each study is provided in the dose finding studies.

Reteplase showed a dose-dependent reduction in plasma concentrations of fibrinogen, plasminogen as well  as  a  dose  dependent  increase  in  fibrin  degradation  products,  measured  as  D-Dimers,  and fibrinogen degradation products. Reteplase was well tolerated with regard to effects on vital signs and laboratory parameters.

The  influence  of  reteplase  on  the  hemostatic  and  fibrinolytic  system  suggests  that  reteplase  is  a moderate fibrin-selective plasminogen activator which should be used with aspirin and heparin since

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

its  administration  results  in  a  procoagulant  state  which  lasts  at  least  2  days  after  the  reteplase  dose regimen claimed for.

The  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  reteplase  in  patients  with  AMI  were  considered  to  be  sufficiently evaluated in order to conduct further trials with the 10 MU + 10 MU dosage regimen. Furthermore sufficient data were available for doses which might represent the upper limit (15 MU as a bolus) and the lower limit (10 MU) of the therapeutic dose.

## Pharmacokinetics

Plasma concentrations of reteplase were measured by using both enzymatic plasminogen activity assay and  immunological  ELISA  antigen  technique.  Plasma  activity  concentrations  were  lower  than  the measurements of the respective antigen concentrations probably due to complex formation with plasma inhibitors. This finding has been reported for rt-PA as well.

The  two  measurements  methods  resulted  in  two  different  plasma  concentration-time  curves.  The plasma enzymatic activity concentration showed a monoexponential pharmacokinetic profile whereas the plasma concentrations of reteplase antigen revealed a biexponential pharmacokinetic profile.

The conventional calculated pharmacokinetic parameters were as follows: peak concentration (Cmax, U/ml),  area  under  the  curve  (AUC,  U.ml.h),  volume  of  distribution  (litres),  alpha  half-life  (t ‰ , minutes), beta half-life (t ‰ , hours), clearance (ml/min).

The above-mentioned M1 , M2 and N1 pharmacodynamics studies supplied also pharmacokinetic data in healthy volunteers.

With respect to the 6 MU dosages, clearance values were 371 ml/min for reteplase enzymatic activity and 183 ml/min for reteplase antigen. The respective alpha t ‰ were 11 minutes and 14 minutes.

A dose dependent linear increase of AUC as measured by the enzymatic activity was observed after single  intravenous  bolus  doses  ranging  between  2.2  MU  and  5.5  MU  reteplase.  The  Cmax  values showed a trend to a linear increase for doses between 2.2 MU and 6.6 MU.

These  studies  demonstrated  a  lower  total  clearance  and  a  longer  activity  half-life  for  reteplase  as compared to alteplase.

Study P1 and P3 described below supplied also pharmacokinetics data in AMI patients.

The AUC and Cmax values increased with doses between single bolus 10 MU and double bolus 10 + 10 MU. The values of clearance as well as the respective t ‰ did  not show any relevant differences within the dose range of 10 MU to 10 MU + 10 MU. The elimination pattern remained the same within the same dose range.

With respect to the 10 MU + 10 MU dosage regimen used in further therapeutic trials, clearance values were 275 ml/min for reteplase enzymatic activity and 115 ml/min for reteplase antigen. The respective alpha t ‰ was 12.4 minutes and 17 minutes. The beta t ‰ for reteplase antigen was 5.5 hours.

Urinary elimination of reteplase was less than 4%.

Two days after thrombolysis reteplase antigen and activity had virtually returned to baseline.

The pharmacokinetic properties of reteplase have been sufficiently evaluated in Caucasian and Asian healthy volunteers and Caucasian patients with AMI. The pharmacokinetic results obtained in humans are consistent with the pharmacokinetic animal results.

The pharmacokinetic studies confirmed reteplase has a lower clearance and a longer t ‰ than  t-PA. Studies  showed  that  patients  with  AMI  generally  have  a  lower  clearance  and  a  longer  t ‰ than  the healthy volunteers as a function of their clinical condition.

The pharmacokinetic profile has not been investigated in patients with severely impaired liver function and  renal  dysfunction.  Since  the  experimental  data  suggest  that  both  organs  are  involved  in  the metabolism  and  excretion  of  reteplase,  these  patients  should  be  excluded  from  reteplase  until additional data are available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Interactions between reteplase and acetylsalicylic acid and/or heparin respectively were investigated in preclinical  studies.  No  clinical  studies  aimed  specifically  to  evaluate  interactions  between  reteplase and other medicinal products.

On the basis of experimental findings and clinical experience gathered from other thrombolytic agents, the potential and relevant interactions with respect to risk of bleeding are mentioned in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## Dose finding studies

Four clinical studies were performed in order to optimise the reteplase dosage regimen in patients with AMI.  Major  evaluation  criteria  were  angiographic  changes  of  coronary  perfusion  using  the  TIMI criteria (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction).

These are defined as follows: TIMI flow 0 (no perfusion), flow 1 (penetration without perfusion), flow 2 (partial perfusion), flow 3 (complete perfusion).

Efficacy  endpoints  were  patency  (TIMI  2-  or  TIMI  3  flow)  and  TIMI  3  flow  at  90  minutes  after administration of the first reteplase bolus. Based on the results of the GUSTO I angiographic substudy, TIMI 3 flow has been shown to be correlated with survival rate and favourable prognosis in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy for AMI.

A  total  of  219  patients  with  suspected  myocardial  infarction  were  enrolled  in  3  open  uncontrolled studies ( P 1, 2, 3 ) and treated with an intravenous single or double bolus regimen of 10 MU, 15 MU, 10 + 5 MU or 10 + 10 MU:

Study P1 was a sequentially designed multicentre trial evaluating 10 MU and subsequently 15 MU reteplase administered as single bolus dose in a total of 142 patients with AMI (symptom onset ≤ 6 hours).  The  initial  dose  of  10  MU  was  selected  on  the  basis  of  previous  experimental  and  human pharmacology data which suggested efficacy and acceptable safety with respect to bleedings.

The primary endpoint was 90-minutes patency, secondary target criteria included patency assessed at 30, 60 minutes and at day 14-21.

The  results  with  respect  to  the  primary  and  secondary  target  criteria  showed  that  reteplase  15  MU produced a 9 % higher patency rate at 90 minutes than the 10 MU dose (76% versus 67%)

If only the TIMI 3 rates were considered the results were 69% and 52% respectively.

There was a trend to more early reocclusions and serious adverse events in the 15 MU dose group but these  results  did  not  seem  to  be  different  as  compared  to  other  thrombolytic  agents.  Tests  for antibodies against reteplase were found to be negative.

In summary, the results showed that 15 MU reteplase dose seemed to have a better benefit-risk ratio than the 10 MU dose.

Study P2 was a sequentially designed multicentre study evaluating an intravenous 10 + 5 MU double bolus dose regimen of reteplase in 52 patients with AMI (symptom onset ≤ 6 hours).

Based on the results of study P 1, the double bolus regimen was chosen in order to increase efficacy and decrease the risk of adverse events, in particular bleedings.

On the basis of the pharmacokinetic characteristics (e.g. the half-life; furthermore, the Cmax value of the 10+5 MU dose was lower than that of the 15 MU dose, whereas the AUCs were comparable), the second reteplase bolus was administered 30 minutes after the first bolus.

The  results  of  this  trial  showed  that  the  10  +  5  MU  regimen  produced  comparable  patency  -  and reocclusion rates to those of the 15 MU dose.

Since  there  was  no  indication  for  an  increased  risk  of  haemorrhages  for  the  10  +  5  MU  dosage regimen, study P 3 was conducted with a higher dose of the second bolus i.e. the 10 + 10 MU double bolus regimen of reteplase.

Study P 3 evaluated the effects of 3 different doses and regimens of reteplase (15 MU, 10 + 5 MU, 10 + 10 MU) in 25 patients with AMI (onset of symptoms ≤ 6 hours) in a randomised fashion.

In this study the 15 MU dose seemed to be most effective regarding angiographic variables but due to the small sample sizes these results were difficult to interpret. Thus, all three dosage regimens were included  in  the  subsequent  larger  RAPID  I  trial  to  better  define  the  optimal  dosage  regimen  of reteplase.

No antibodies against reteplase were detected at the time of discharge.

RAPID I was an open, randomised, controlled, parallel group multicentre study involving 606 AMI patients (onset of symptoms ≤ 6 hours). The angiograms were read blinded by two core laboratories. The trial compared the aforementioned (see P 3) dosage regimens of reteplase (15 MU, 10 + 5 MU, 10 + 10 MU) with the former standard regimen of rt-PA (3 hours infusion).

The primary efficacy endpoint was 90- minute patency of the infarct-related coronary artery.

Secondary endpoints were patency and TIMI 3 rates at 30 and 60 minutes after thrombolysis and at follow-up ( ≥ 7 days). Other secondary efficacy- and safety variables included reocclusions, coronary interventions, ejection fraction, clinical events and outcome, strokes, bleedings, antibodies to reteplase and survival status (monitored at short-term and up to 6 months after thrombolysis).

Of the 3 reteplase dosage regimens, only 10+10 MU produced a statistically significant higher TIMI 3 rate than alteplase, but no significant difference was seen in patency rates at 90 minutes.

During  follow-up,  patency-  and  TIMI  3  rates  were  significantly  better  for  the  10+10  MU  reteplase group as compared to alteplase.

The reocclusion rates (patent artery at 90 minutes after thrombolysis but occluded artery at follow-up angiography)  and  coronary  intervention  rates  were  comparable  in  the  10+10  MU  reteplase  and alteplase groups.

During follow-up the 10+10 MU group had a comparable incidence of short-term clinical events than the other reteplase regimens or alteplase, as well as a statistically significant better ejection fraction than the latter.

The  number  of  serious  adverse  events  and  the  respective  drop-out  rate  were  comparable  between 10+10 MU reteplase and alteplase.

The  rate  of  patients  suffering  from  bleedings  and  receiving  transfusions  was  comparable  between alteplase and the 10+10 MU reteplase group.

The short-term and long-term mortality rates were comparable between the reteplase regimens and the alteplase group.

Three deaths considered positively related to thrombolytic therapy (e.g. due to intracranial haemorrhage  or  hemopericardium)  occurred  in  the  alteplase  group  whereas  one  of  such  death  was observed in each reteplase dosage regimen.

During the short-term follow-up, 3.9% of the alteplase treated patients suffered strokes 2.6 % of which were haemorrhagic. Patients treated with the 10 + 10 MU and the 10 + 5 MU reteplase dosage regimen did not suffer any stroke but one patient in the 15 MU group had intracranial bleeding. The differences in stroke rates between alteplase and the 10 + 10 MU (as well as the 10 + 5 MU) dosage regimen were statistically significant.

No  clinically  relevant  differences  were  observed  between  the  four  treatments  with  respect  to  noncerebral bleedings.

No antibody formation to reteplase could be detected during short-term and long-term follow-up.

Based on the angiographic results this study showed that the dosage regimen of 10 + 10 MU reteplase was most effective. The overall safety profile and especially the incidence of intracerebral bleedings suggest that the benefit/risk ratio of the 10 + 10 MU double bolus regimen was at least equal to that of the former alteplase standard regimen.

Consequently the 10 +10 MU reteplase dosage regimen was selected for the subsequent confirmatory trials.

## Confirmatory trials

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two randomised active-controlled, parallel group, multicentre trials implying a statistically confirmatory approach were performed in 6334 patients with AMI (symptom onset less or equal to 12 hours) in order to evaluate efficacy in terms of and angiographic and clinical outcome measures and to determine the safety of reteplase (RAPID II, INJECT).

RAPID  II trial  was  an  open,  randomised,  alteplase  controlled  parallel  group  multicenter  study involving 324 AMI patients. Though the study was conducted in an open label design, the reading of the angiograms was performed by a central core laboratory blinded to all treatment groups.

This trial compared reteplase 10+10 MU with the accelerated alteplase dosage regimen (15 mg bolus injection followed by a 0.75 mg/kg infusion over 30 minutes and a subsequent 0.50 mg/kg infusion over 60 minutes).

The primary efficacy endpoint was patency of the infarct-related coronary artery at 90 minutes after the initiation of thrombolytic therapy.

Secondary endpoints were patency- and TIMI 3 rates at 30, 60 minutes, day 5 after thrombolysis and at angiographic follow-up (mean value 6.4 days).

Other  secondary  efficacy  and  safety  variables  evaluated  at  short-term  included  ejection  fraction, reocclusions,  coronary  interventions,  relevant  clinical  events,  strokes,  net  clinical  benefit,  whereas survival status was assessed 35 days and 6 months after thrombolysis.

The 10+10 MU reteplase group had statistically significant higher 90-minute patency and TIMI 3 rates than  the  alteplase  group  (differences  of  10  %  and  15%  respectively).  As  already  observed  in  the RAPID GUSTO and I I trials, patients with TIMI 3 flow had a significantly lower mortality rate as compared to patients with TIMI 0-1.

Though not statistically significant, the in-hospital coronary reocclusion rate was 2% higher but the rate of coronary interventions within 35 days was significantly lower for reteplase.

No  significant  differences  between  the  two  treatments  were  found  with  regard  to  ejection  fraction, relevant  clinical  events  including  shock,  reinfarction,  ischaemia/angina,  congestive  heart  failure, malignant arrhythmias and hypotension.

The rates of patients suffering adverse events and bleedings requiring transfusions were comparable in the alteplase and reteplase groups.

The percentage of patients who suffered stroke within 35 days of follow-up was 3 % in the reteplase group and 4.5% in the alteplase group. This difference, as well as that for haemorrhagic strokes (1.2 % and 1.9%) was not statistically significant.

The  differences  in  35-day  mortality  rates  (4.1%  for  reteplase  and  8.4%  for  alteplase)  and  6-month mortality rates (6.1% for reteplase and 10.3% for alteplase) were not statistically significant.

The death of 3 patients in the alteplase group was judged to be positively related to the medication but this was not the case for any death in the reteplase group.

The  difference  in  the  'net  clinical  benefit'  (retrospectively  defined  combined  endpoint  of  death  or continuing disability induced by stroke at day 35 after thrombolysis) was not statistically significant (5.3 % for reteplase and 9% for alteplase).

Hence, the RAPID II study resulted in a significant better benefit risk ratio of 10+10 MU reteplase as compared to the accelerated rt-PA regimen regarding patients with AMI (symptom onset less or equal to 12 hours).

INJECT was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  streptokinase-controlled  parallel  group  multicentre  trial involving 6010 patients with AMI. The trial was designed to determine whether reteplase was at least 'equivalent' (within 1 %) to a standard regimen of streptokinase with regard to all cause mortality at day 35 after thrombolysis (primary efficacy criterion).

All cause mortality at 6 months after thrombolytic therapy as well as reinfarction, heart failure, stroke and coronary interventions during the first 35 days following thrombolysis were investigated as major secondary efficacy criteria.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Other  secondary  efficacy  and  safety  variables  included  cardiovascular  events  like  for  instance intracerebral  bleedings,  cardiogenic  shock,  clinically  relevant  arrhythmia,  hypotension,  as  well  as bleedings, allergic reactions, antibody formation to reteplase and 'net clinical benefit'.

The majority of the patients -and approx. the same proportion in both treatment groups- received i.v. heparin (48-72 hours) and low dose ASA (until discharge) concomitantly with thrombolytic therapy.

The  results  concerning  the  primary  endpoint  35-day  all  cause  mortality  were  9.53  %  in  the streptokinase group (285 deaths) and 9.02 % (270 deaths) in the reteplase group.

The difference of -0.51 % in favour of reteplase was not statistically significant (95 % CI: -1.98 % to 0.96  %).  On  the  basis  of  the  statistical  approach  these  results  indicated,  that  reteplase  was  at  least equivalent to streptokinase with respect to the 35-day all cause mortality rate.

Mortality rates at 6 months were 11.02 % for reteplase and 12.05% for streptokinase. The difference of 1.03% was not statistically significant as well.

The  in-hospital  stroke  rate  was  1.21%  for  reteplase  and  1.01%  for  streptokinase.  The  difference  in haemorrhagic strokes (reteplase 0.78%, streptokinase 0.37%) was statistically significant. Furthermore the  reteplase  treatment  was  associated  with  a  significantly  higher  stroke  rate  in  patients  with  an admission systolic blood pressure of greater than 160 mm Hg (10% of total study population).

However, the 'net clinical benefit' (retrospectively defined combined endpoint of death by day 35 day or  continuing  disability  from  an  in-hospital  stroke)  was  9.19  %  for  reteplase  and  9.79%  for streptokinase, although this difference was not statistically significant.

Reteplase resulted in lower cardiovascular event rates than streptokinase in-hospital as well as at day 35 after thrombolysis.

The  incidence  of  recurrent  myocardial  infarction  was  similar  in  the  two  treatment  groups  but statistically significant differences in favour of reteplase were observed with regard to the frequencies of  atrial  fibrillation,  asystole,  cardiac  shock,  hypotension  and  heart  failure  (this  difference  was  also reflected in a reduced need for heart failure drugs).

Significantly fewer reteplase treated patients than streptokinase treated patients (22.5% versus 24.9%, p=0.02) reported serious adverse events.

The  rates  of  bleeding  events  either  serious  or  non  serious  were  comparable  in  the  two  treatment groups.  15.21%  of  the  reteplase  treated  patients  and  15.48%  of  those  treated  with  streptokinase reported bleedings in hospital. 1.11% and 1.35% respectively were considered to be serious and 0.64% of the reteplase group as well as 0.98% of the streptokinase group needed transfusions.

Formation of antibodies to reteplase could not be detected in 1934 patients whose blood samples were examined up to 5 weeks after thrombolysis.

Fewer allergic reactions were observed for reteplase as compared to streptokinase (1.13% for reteplase and 1.77% for streptokinase).

3  patients  in  the  reteplase  group  and  10  patients  in  the  streptokinase  group  reported  fatal  or  life threatening which were classified as being unexpected.

At  present,  one  patient  enrolled  in  the  ongoing  GUSTO  III  trial  has  experienced  an  anaphylactoid/ anaphylactic reaction which was judged to be positively related to reteplase and of which the outcome was fatal in the setting of AMI.

In summary, the safety profile of reteplase was satisfactory and seemed to be at least comparable to that  of  streptokinase.  On  the  basis  of  the  INJECT  data  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of  reteplase  can  be considered to be at least equal to that of streptokinase.

## 5. Conclusion

Reteplase is a new recombinant thrombolytic agent produced by recombinant DNA technique.

The manufacturing and production process has been shown to be acceptable in terms of quality and reproductibility.  A  batch-to  batch  consistency  has  been  shown  for  the  active  ingredient  and  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

finished  product.  After  the  granting  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  the  company  has  submitted satisfactory results of additional studies including stability data.

The  extent  and  quality  of  the  preclinical  programme  were  considered  acceptable  for  the  use  of reteplase in the treatment of AMI.

The  dose  finding  for  reteplase  has  been  performed  thoroughly  and  adequate  efforts  were  made  to optimise the dosage regimen applied for, as well as to estimate the benefit-risk ratio of doses higher and lower than that recommended.

Clinical efficacy and safety of reteplase were established on the basis of angiographic measurements and  all  cause  mortality  rate  (at  day  35  after  thrombolysis)  from  adequate  confirmatory  randomised active  controlled trials  using  the  currently  acknowledged standard thrombolytic agents alteplase and streptokinase used as comparators. Both aforementioned studies showed a benefit risk ratio of reteplase at least as equal to alteplase based on angiographic data, and streptokinase based on 35-day all cause mortality results.

Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus that  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  Rapilysin  was  favourable  in  the  treatment  of  thrombolytic  therapy  of acute myocardial infarction within 12 hours after the onset of acute myocardial infarction symptoms.

Rapilysin  is  presented  as  a  powder  for  injection  administered  as  a  10  U  +  10  U  double  bolus intravenous  injection.  Each  bolus  is  administered  as  a  slow  intravenous  injection  over  2  minutes whereas the second bolus is administered 30 minutes after the first bolus.

## 6. Post-Authorisation

The GUSTO  III  clinical  trial in  approximately  15,000  patients  comparing  reteplase  with  the accelerated dose regimen of alteplase (2:1 randomisation reteplase:alteplase) did not show statistically different results for the primary endpoint of 30-day mortality (reteplase: 7.47%, alteplase 7.23%, p = 0.61)  or  for  the  combined  endpoint  of  30-day  mortality  and  non-fatal  disabling  stroke  (reteplase: 7.89%,  alteplase  7.88%,  p  =  0.99).  Overall  stroke  rates  were  1.64  %  for  reteplase  and  1.79%  for alteplase.  In  the  reteplase  group,  49.4%  of  these  strokes  were  fatal  and  27.1%  were  disabling.  The corresponding figures for the alteplase group were 33.0% and 39.8%, respectively.

In December 1999 the MAH informed the EMEA of the need to trigger an Urgent Safety Restriction (USR) due to a risk  to  public  health,  based  on  the  reports  of  flocculation  of  Rapilysin  when  given concomitantly with heparin in the same intravenous line. As a result, sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.6 of the SPC were updated, in order to highlight the incompatibility of Rapilysin with heparin.

In  March  2001  the  wording  of  the  therapeutic  indication  for  all  fibrinolytic  agents  was  changed following a recommendation from CPMP In October 2000. The new wording states that Rapilysin is indicated  for  the  thrombolytic  treatment  of  suspected  myocardial  infarction  with  persistent  ST elevation or recent left Bundle Branch Block within 12 hours after the onset of AMI symptoms\".

In August 2003 the contraindication in diabetic patients (section 4.3 of the SPC) was deleted following the publication of a CPMP position statement concerning the use of iv fibrinolytics in diabetic patients.

## Reports of adverse drug reactions

Frequently reported sequelae of MI and/or thrombolytic administration are recurrent ischemia/angina, hypotension and heart failure/pulmonary oedema. Arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock and reinfarction have been ocassionally reported and there have been rare reports of mitral regurgitation, pulmonary embolism, other systemic embolism/cerebral embolism and ventricular septal defect. These cardiovascular events can be life-threatening and may lead to death.

Adverse events related to the nervous system (e.g. epileptic seizure, aphasia, speech disorder, delirium, acute  brain  syndrome,  agitation,  confusion,  depression,  psychosis)  have  been  reported  in  isolated cases. Ischaemic or haemorrhagic cerebrovascular events may  be  contributing or underlying conditions.

Hypersensitivity  reactions  have  been  uncommonly  reported,  and  there  have  been  isolated  reports  of serious  anaphylactic/anaphylactoid  reactions.  Available  evidence  does  not  indicate  an  antibodymediated origin of these hypersensitivity reactions.
