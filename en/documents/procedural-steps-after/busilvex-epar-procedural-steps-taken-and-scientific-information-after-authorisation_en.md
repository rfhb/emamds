1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions

are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

|         | In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to clarify statement on incompatibilities in sections 6.2 and 6.6 and to expand the incompatibility of the polycarbonates syringes with Busilvex to the incompatibility of any infusion components containing polycarbonate with Busilvex. This change has been reflected on the subsection \"Instructions for use\" of the section 2 \"recommendations for safe handling\" in the preparation guide of the Package Leaflet. In addition, QRD-related changes have been implemented in annex II.

This study demonstrated that bodyweight was the predominant covariate to explain the busulfan pharmacokinetic variability in children over body surface area or age. The recommended posology for children enabled over 70% up to 90% of children ≥ 9 kg in achieving the therapeutic window (900-1500 µmol/L.minute). However a higher variability was observed in children < 9 kg leading to 60% of children achieving the therapeutic window (900 1500 µmol/L.minute). For the 40% of children < 9 kg outside the target, the AUC was evenly distributed either below or above the targeted limits; i.e. 20% each < 900 and > 1500 µmol/L.min following 1 mg/kg. In this regard, for children < 9 kg, a monitoring of the plasma concentrations of busulfan (therapeutic drug monitoring) for dose-adjustment may improve the busulfan targeting performance, no longer authorised   |

No evidence of an induction effect of phenytoin has been seen on Busilvex data. A phase II clinical trial was performed to evaluate the influence of seizure prophylaxis treatment on intravenous busulfan pharmacokinetics. In this study, 24 adult patients received clonazepam (0.025 0.03 mg/kg/day as IV continuous infusions) as anticonvulsant therapy and the PK data of these patients were compared to historical data collected in patients treated with phenytoin. The analysis of data through a population pharmacokinetic method indicated no difference on intravenous busulfan clearance between phenytoin and clonazepam based therapy and therefore similar busulfan plasma exposures were achieved whatever the type of authorised   |
