## Introduction

On  29/09/2020,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Orkambi  [ VX15-809-110 (Treatment Period 2) ], in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

Study VX15-809-110 (Study 110) was a Phase 3, open label, multicenter, rollover study in subjects aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF), who were homozygous for F508del-CFTR, and who participated  in  parent  Study  VX14-809-109  or  Study  VX13-809-011B.  Study  110  consisted  of  2 Treatment Periods.

Treatment Period 1 was a 96-week study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of  LUM/IVA  treatment  for  96  weeks  in  subjects  aged  6  years  and  older  with  cystic  fibrosis  (CF), homozygous for F508del. Efficacy was evaluated as a secondary objective. The results of treatment Period 1 [Study 110 Treatment Period 1 CSR (dated 25 February 2019)] have been previously submitted  under  Article  16  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  1234/2008  as  a  Type  II  variation (EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049, CHMP Opinion 09 July 2020).

Treatment Period 2 was optional for subjects enrolled in France who completed LUM/IVA treatment in Treatment Period 1 and were aged 6 through 11 years at the time of entry into Treatment Period 2. LUM/IVA was to be administered for up to approximately 168 weeks of additional LUM/IVA treatment, or until LUM/IVA was commercially available for the eligible subjects.

The Study 110 Final CSR (dated 24 August 2020) , submitted by the MAH within this procedure, includes  the  final  results  from  both  Treatment  Periods  1  and  2.  The  MAH  states  that  because Treatment Period 1 has already been assessed by CHMP as a Type II variation (EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049), only Treatment Period 2 results are being submitted under Article 46 and are discussed further below.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## CHMP comment

The MAH should clarify if, apart from the results of Treatment Period 2, there are other differences between Study 110 Treatment Period 1 CSR (dated 25 February 2019) , previously submitted within variation EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049, and Study  110  Final  CSR  (dated  24  August  2020) , submitted by the MAH within this procedure. Differences between the two CSR should be highlighted and adequately discussed (OC).

Study: VX15-809-110 (Treatment Period 2)

Study  Initiation  (Treatment  Period  2) :  21  March  2018  (date  first  eligible  subject  signed  the informed consent/assent form)

Study  Completion  (Treatment  Period  2) :  24 April 2020 (date last subject completed the Safety Follow-up Visit)

Treatment Period 2 was conducted at 3 sites in France.

Treatment Period 2 was optional for subjects enrolled in France who completed LUM/IVA treatment in Treatment Period 1 and were aged 6 through 11 years at the time of entry into Treatment Period 2. LUM/IVA was to be administered for up to approximately 168 weeks of additional LUM/IVA treatment in  Treatment  Period  2  or  until  LUM/IVA  was  commercially  available  for  the  eligible  subjects.  All  10 subjects  enrolled  in  Treatment  Period  2  discontinued  treatment  when  commercial  drug  became available for children 6 through 11 years of age in France. Thus, the maximum treatment duration in Treatment Period 2 was up to approximately 89 weeks of additional LUM/IVA treatment. Treatment duration of LUM/IVA ranged from 80 to 624 days in Treatment Period 2).

The Study 110 Final CSR (dated 24 August 2020) , submitted by the MAH within this procedure, includes  the  final  results  from  both  Treatment  Periods  1  and  2.  The  MAH  states  that  because Treatment Period 1 has already been assessed by the EMA as a Type II variation (EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049), only Treatment Period 2 results are being submitted under Article 46 and are discussed further below.

Study 110 Treatment Period 1 CSR (dated 25 February 2019) was previously submitted to the EMA  under  Article  16  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  1234/2008  as  a  Type  II  variation (EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment Period 2 included only a Treatment Cohort (referred to as Treatment Cohort Period 2) and was optional for subjects enrolled in France who completed Treatment Cohort Period 1 and who were aged 6 through 11 years at the time of entry into Treatment Period 2. LUM/IVA was to be administered for up to approximately 168 additional weeks in Treatment Period 2 or until LUM/IVA was commercially available for the eligible subjects.

In Treatment Period 2, safety assessments included vital signs, physical examinations, ophthalmologic examinations,  serum  chemistry  for  liver  function  test  (LFT)  parameters,  and  monitoring  of  adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) at longer intervals than assessed in Treatment Period 1.

Efficacy was not evaluated in Treatment Period 2.

## Study population /Sample size

## Eligibility Criteria

Treatment  Period  2  was  conducted  only  in  France  and  was  optional  for  subjects  who  completed Treatment Period 1. The key inclusion criterion for subjects entering Treatment Cohort Period 2 was:

-  Completed  dosing  in  Treatment  Cohort  Period  1  and  were  within  the  age  range  of  6  through  11 years.

NOTE: Subjects 6 through 11 years of age who discontinued Treatment Cohort Period 2 could not reenroll in Study 110.

## Exclusion Criteria (same exclusion criteria for Treatment Cohorts 1 and 2)

Subjects who met any of the following exclusion criteria were not eligible:

1. History of any comorbidity or laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the investigator, might have confounded the results of the study or posed an additional risk in administering study drug to the subject (e.g., cirrhosis with portal hypertension).
2. Pregnant and nursing females. Females of childbearing potential must have had a negative urine pregnancy test at the Day 1 Visit before receiving the first dose of study drug.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3. Sexually active subjects of reproductive potential who were not willing to follow the contraception requirements outlined in Protocol Version 2.0 and Protocol Version 3.1.
4. History of drug intolerance in the previous (parent) study that would have posed an additional risk to the subject in the opinion of the investigator, and which should have been discussed with the Vertex medical monitor. Examples of subjects who may not have been eligible for Treatment Cohort Periods 1 or 2 included (but were not limited to) the following:
- Subjects with a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to the study drug
-  Liver  function  test  (LFT)  abnormality  during  study  drug  treatment  in  the  previous  (parent)  study (Study 109 or Study 011B) or Treatment Cohort Period 1 for which a clear cause was not identified:
5. o Abnormal liver function defined as any 2 or more of the following:
- a. ≥ 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) aspartate transaminase (AST)
- b. ≥ 3 × ULN alanine transaminase (ALT)
- c. ≥ 3 × ULN gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)
- d. ≥ 3 × ULN alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
10. o ALT or AST &gt;5 × ULN
11. o Total bilirubin &gt;2 × ULN
12. o Other LFT abnormalities that would have posed an additional risk to the subject in the opinion of the investigator or Vertex
- Other severe or life-threatening reactions to the study drug in the previous (parent) study
5.  History  of  poor  compliance  with  study  drug  and/or  procedures  in  the  previous  (parent)  study  as deemed by the investigator.
6. Participation in an investigational drug trial (including studies investigating LUM and/or IVA). NOTE: Participation  in  a  non-interventional  study  (including  observational  studies,  registry  studies,  and studies  requiring  blood  collections  without  administration  of  study  drug)  was  permitted  (Treatment Cohort Period 1 only).

## Study Restrictions

The medications described in Table 9-1 were prohibited while subjects were receiving LUM/IVA.

A non-exhaustive list of study prohibitions and cautions for food and medication was provided in the Study Reference Manual.

## Table 9-1 Study Restrictions

| RestrictedMedication/Fooda   | TreatmentPeriod   |
|------------------------------|-------------------|
| Strong CYP3A inducers        | Noneallowed       |
| Strong CYP3A inhibitors      | Use with caution  |

Note: The use of restricted medication in subjects with a medical need was addressed on a case-by-case basis with the medical monitor or authorized designee.

See Section 9.3.4 for guidance for concomitant medications.

## Treatments

LUM/IVA tablets were administered orally every 12 hours (q12h).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In Treatment Period 2, subjects aged 6 through 11 years received LUM 200 mg/IVA 250 mg (2 × LUM 100-mg/IVA 125-mg tablet).

## Outcomes/endpoints

Safety data : For Treatment Cohort Period 2, the analysis of safety data was limited to AEs, SAEs, LFTs, vital signs, and OEs.

Clinical Laboratory: The following analyses for the LFT parameters of ALT, AST, ALP, and total bilirubin were conducted:

· The number and percentage of subjects meeting the defined threshold criteria (SAP Version 1.0) during the Treatment-emergent Period of Treatment Cohort Period 2 were summarized.

· A listing for subjects with all LFT results during the Treatment-emergent Period of Treatment Cohort Period 2 was presented. The listing included all parameters of the LFT assessment at all visits.

Results of the urine pregnancy tests were listed in an individual subject data listing.

Vital sign parameters and Ophthalmological Examinations (OE) were presented as a data listing only.

## Statistical Methods

For  Treatment  Cohort  Period  2  subjects,  safety  analyses  were  based  on  the  treatment-emergent period, which started from the Study 110 Week 96 dose date +1 or Week 96 visit date +1, whichever occurred later; up to 28 days (inclusive) after the last dose of this dosing period, or the last available date in Study 110 Treatment Cohort Period 2, whichever occurred first.

For Treatment Cohort Period 2, all summaries included all subjects enrolled in that cohort.

For Treatment Cohort Period 2, AEs were classified as TEAEs or post-treatment AEs.

·  TEAE:  any  AE  that  increased  in  severity  or  that  was  newly  developed  in  the  treatment-emergent period of Treatment Cohort Period 2.

·  Post-treatment  AE:  any  AE  that  increased  in  severity  or  that  was  newly  developed  in  the  posttreatment period of Treatment Cohort Period 2.

AEs with missing or partial start dates were classified as TEAEs if there was no clear evidence that the AEs  started  before  or  after  study  treatment.  Details  regarding  handling  rules  of  missing  dates  are included in SAP Version 1.0.

AE summary tables were presented by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) using frequency counts, percentages (i.e., number and percentage of subjects with 1 or more events), and  exposure-adjusted  number  of  events  (i.e.,  number  of  events  per  100  patient-years  [100PY]). When summarizing the number and percentages of subjects, subjects with multiple occurrences of the same AE or a continuing AE were counted once, and only the maximum severity level was presented in the  severity  summaries,  and  the  worst/highest  relationship  level  in  the  relationship  summaries. Exposure-adjusted  number  of  events  summarized  the  number  of  events  per  100PY  for  AE-related safety data. Note: 1 patient with 48 weeks of exposure duration was defined as 1 patient-year.

Results of safety assessments for Treatment Cohort Period 2 were summarized for all enrolled subjects using descriptive statistics; no formal statistical testing was performed.

## CHMP comment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AEs for Treatment Period 2 have been presented only as number and percentage of subjects with an event. When summarizing the number and percentages of subjects, subjects with multiple occurrences of the same AE within a category was counted only once in that category.

Exposure-adjusted number of events (i.e., number of events per 100 patient-years [100PY]) have not been presented for Treatment Period 2.

However, given that only 10 patients have been enrolled in Treatment Period 2, the issue is not further pursued.

## COVID-19

Three subjects from 1 site in Treatment Period 2 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Safety measures were implemented to provide subjects the opportunity to continue participation in the study while ensuring their safety by minimizing the risk to COVID-19 exposure through travel.

These operational adjustments were implemented to align with Health Authority guidance ensuring the protection of subjects, investigators, and site personnel while maintaining compliance with GCP and minimizing impact to study integrity.

A summary of these measures pertinent to Study 110 Treatment Cohort Period 2 are summarized in Protocol Addendum 1.

·  Subjects  were  contacted  by  site  personnel  by  telephone/video  call  to  complete  the  remaining scheduled visits (i.e., the ETT visit). During this telephone/video call(s), the safety and tolerability of LUM/IVA  was  evaluated  to  ensure  subject  safety.  These  assessments  included  a  review  of  AEs, medications, and study drug administration.

· Blood samples for safety assessments were collected and analyzed at local laboratories. Specifically, an LFT panel was performed, including ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, and total bilirubin.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

Of the 240 subjects in Treatment Cohort Period 1, 13 subjects were enrolled at sites in France. Ten subjects were eligible for Treatment Cohort Period 2; all 10 enrolled and received at least 1 dose of LUM/IVA  during  Treatment  Period  2.  All  10  subjects  discontinued  treatment  when  commercial  drug became available for children 6 through 11 years of age in France.

The  treatment  duration  of  LUM/IVA  ranged  from  80  to  624  days  for  subjects  in  Treatment  Cohort Period 2.

No subjects completed treatment or the study in Treatment Cohort Period 2; all 10 (100.0%) subjects discontinued treatment because commercial drug became available in France.

## CHMP comment

During Treatment Period 2, LUM/IVA was to be administered for up to approximately 168 weeks of additional LUM/IVA treatment or until LUM/IVA was commercially available for the eligible subjects. All 10  subjects  enrolled  in  Treatment  Period  2  discontinued  treatment  early,  when  commercial  drug became available  for  children  6  through  11  years  of  age  in  France.  Thus,  the  maximum  treatment duration in Treatment Period 2 was up to approximately 89 weeks of additional LUM/IVA treatment. Treatment duration of LUM/IVA in Treatment Period 2 ranged from 80 to 624 days (from less than 3

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

months to slightly less than 2 years). The MAH should provide mean and median treatment duration in Treatment Period 2, for the 10 patients enrolled in Treatment Period 2 ( OC ).

## Baseline data

Nine out of 10 subjects were White (90.0%) and not Hispanic or Latino (90.0%). Half of the subjects were male (50.0%). The mean age at parent study baseline was 7.6 years (SD: 0.84; range 6 to 9 years).

The most common concomitant medications (&gt;50% of subjects) taken during Treatment Period 2 were pancreatin, cholecalciferol, dornase alfa, sodium chloride, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, tobramycin, and tocopheryl acetate.

BMI: body mass index; LCI2.s: number of lung turnovers required to reduce the end tidal inert gas concentration to 1/40th of its starting value; N: total sample size; n: size of subsample; ppFEV1: percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second

Note: Baseline for sweat chloride was defined as the average of the measurements at screening and on Day 1 predose in Studies 109/011B; baseline for other variables was defined as the most recent measurement before the first dose of study drug in Studies 109/011B.

- The z-scores were calculated by using the National Center for Health Statistics growth charts.

Measurements  of  Treatment  Compliance: Study drug compliance was 100% for each individual subject during Treatment Cohort Period 2

## Efficacy results

Not applicable. Efficacy was not evaluated in Treatment Period 2.

## Safety results

- A total of 9 subjects had at least 1 AE.
-  All  9  subjects  had  AEs  that  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity,  and  none  had  AEs  that  were considered related or possibly related to study drug.

One  (10.0%)  subject  had  1  AE  that  was  considered  unlikely  related  to  study  drug  (SOC:  Nervous system disorders/ PT: Headache, mild in severity, dose not changed, treatment required, outcome: not recovered/ not resolved).

- There were no deaths.
-  No  subject  had  an  SAE,  AE  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation,  or  AE  leading  to  treatment interruption.
- No subject had ALT or AST &gt;3 × Upper Limit of Normal (ULN), ALP &gt;1.5 × ULN, or total bilirubin &gt;1.5 × ULN. No subject had an AE related to elevated transaminases
-  No  clinically  meaningful  adverse  changes  or  trends  were  observed  for  laboratory  or  vital  sign measurements.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For 17/58 (29%) of the TEAEs, the outcome was reported as not recovered/ not resolved. Apart from one event of mild Headache (reported as unlikely related), all the other events were reported as not related and the dose was not changed following the occurrence of the event. Twelve of these events were mild [PTs: headache, gastritis, cough (n=2), rhinitis, nasopharyngitis, hepatomegaly, epistaxis, dyspepsia,  constipation,  rhinitis  allergic,  wheezing)  and  five  were  moderate  in  intensity  (PTs: abdominal pain, glucose tolerance impaired, bacterial disease carrier, bronchiectasis, bronchitis).

## CHMP comment

Of note, in the Tables reporting AEs by PT, when summarizing number and percentage of subjects, a subject with multiple events within a category was counted only once in that category.

Thus, the information provided may be misleading. For example the PT of infective PEX of CF are 4 (40%) but PEx occurred more than one time in 2 out of 4 subjects: in  two  subjects  ≥2 PEx event occurred (of note, in one of these subjects, 3 PEx events occurred within 8 months); in a third subject one event of PEx and a further event of Pneumopathy/ Radiological Focus on the left base of the lung occurred.

## Weight, Height, and BMI

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Weight,  height,  and  BMI  data  were  generally  consistent  with  a  growing  pediatric  population.  One subject had an AE of weight decreased that was moderate in severity and considered not related to study drug.

## Ophthalmological Examinations

One subject had abnormal lens findings on both eyes at the ETT visit; no lens opacity was reported. Previous  OEs  for  this  subject  were  normal,  including  visits  during  Treatment  Period  1.  All  other subjects had normal lens findings in Treatment Cohort Period 2. No subject had an AE related to lens findings.

## CHMP comment

The MAH states that one subject, with previous normal Ophthalmological Examinations, had abnormal lens findings on both eyes at the Early Termination of Treatment visit. The MAH should clarify what kind of abnormal findings were reported and provide information on the follow-up of this event i.e. resolved/not (OC) .

## 1.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Study VX15-809-110 (Study 110) was a Phase 3, open label, multicenter, rollover study in subjects aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF), who were homozygous for F508del-CFTR, and who participated in parent Study VX14-809-109 or Study VX13-809-011B.

Study 110 consisted of 2 Treatment Periods.

Treatment Period 1 was a 96-week study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of LUM/IVA treatment for 96 weeks in subjects aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF), homozygous for F508del. Efficacy was evaluated as a secondary objective.  Treatment Period 1 results have already been assessed by CHMP through a Type II variation (EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049).

The MAH states that only Treatment Period 2 results are being submitted under Article 46 and thus only results of Treatment Period 2 are discussed in this AR.

However, given that Study 110 Final CSR (dated 24 August 2020), submitted by the MAH within this procedure, includes the final results from both Treatment Periods 1 and 2, the MAH was requested to clarify if, apart from the results of Treatment Period 2, there were other differences between Study 110  Treatment  Period  1  CSR  (dated  25  February  2019) ,  previously submitted within variation EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049, and Study 110 Final CSR (dated 24 August 2020) , submitted by the MAH within this procedure. This is deemed of importance, also in light of the fact that the final results from  Study  110  Treatment  Period  1 will  be  used  to  provide  additional  context  to  the  disease progression patterns observed in the analyses of US CFFPR and ECFSPR data within the PAES study in the 2-5 years age range.

The MAH clarified  that, apart from the results of Treatment Period 2, the only differences between the Study 110 Treatment Period 1 CSR (dated 25 February 2019; previously submitted within variation EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049) and Study 110 Final CSR (dated 24 August 2020) are minimal consisting of clarifications or correction of typos. No changes or updates to the Treatment Period 1 data or results discussion were made in the Study 110 Final CSR.

Treatment Period 2 was optional for subjects enrolled at 3 sites in France. All the 10 subjects who were &lt;12 years of age at the end of the 96 weeks of Treatment Period 1, opted to enrol in Treatment Period 2 of the study to receive up to 168 weeks (approximately) of additional LUM/IVA treatment, for continued assessment of safety.

All 10 subjects enrolled in Treatment Period 2 discontinued prematurely from Treatment Period 2 (prior to the foreseen 168 weeks of additional LUM/IVA treatment), when commercial drug became available for  children  6  through  11  years  of  age  in  France.  The  maximum  treatment  duration  in  Treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Period 2 was up to approximately 89 weeks (624 days) of additional LUM/IVA treatment; the mean and median  treatment  duration  was  414.8  days  and  426.5  days  (ranging  from  80  to  624  days), respectively.

Although this is a very small subgroup and therefore making a comparison has key limits, the baseline characteristics  at  parent  study  baseline  of  this  small  subgroup  entering  Treatment  period  2  were similar to the overall population with the exception of being younger (7.6 years range: 6 to 9 years as compared to 8.9 range 6-12) and as a consequence of having the anthropometric measures slightly lower than those of the overall population. The baseline disease characteristics were similar i.e. sweat chloride or even indicating milder lung disease i.e. ppFEV1.

Efficacy outcomes were not assessed in treatment Period 2.

As regards to safety in Treatment Cohort Period 2, most subjects (90.0%) had at least 1 AE however these were mild or moderate in severity; no deaths or SAE occurred.  No subject had AEs that were considered related or possibly related to study drug, AE leading to treatment discontinuation, or AE leading to treatment interruption.

No  clinically  meaningful  adverse  changes  or  trends  were  observed  for  laboratory  or  vital  sign measurements and specifically there were no transaminase elevations &gt;3 × ULN.

In these 10 subjects that received up to approximately 89 weeks of additional LUM/IVA treatment, no new safety concerns were identified.  In Tables reporting AEs by PT, a subject with multiple events within  a  category  was  counted  only  once  in  that  category,  thus  numbers  may  be  misleading;  for example the PT of infective PEX of CF are 4 (40%) but PEx occurred more than one time in 2 out of 4 subjects; in a third subject one event of PEx and a further event of Pneumopathy/ Radiological Focus on  the  left  base  of  the  lung  occurred.  Due  to  the  limited  number  (N=10)  of  subjects  enrolled  in Treatment Cohort Period 2, the variable treatment duration in each subject (treatment duration ranged from  80  to  624  days)  and  due  to  multiple  events  counted  only  once  within  each  category,  no conclusion may be drawn on the frequencies of AEs observed in this study.

## 2. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

## Fulfilled: No regulatory action required.

## 3. Additional clarification requested

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure:

1. The  MAH  should  clarify  if,  apart  from  the  results  of  Treatment  Period  2,  there  are  other differences between Study 110 Treatment Period 1 CSR (dated 25 February 2019), previously submitted  within  variation  EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049,  and  Study  110  Final  CSR  (dated  24 August 2020), submitted by the MAH within this procedure. Differences between the two CSR should be highlighted and adequately discussed.
2. The MAH should provide mean and median treatment duration in Treatment Period 2, for the 10 patients enrolled in Treatment Period 2
3. The  MAH  should  clarify  what  kind  of  abnormal  findings  were  reported  in  the  subject  with previous normal Ophthalmological Examinations, that had abnormal lens findings on both eyes at  the  Early  Termination of  Treatment visit and provide information on the follow up of this event i.e. resolved/not.

The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop.

## Summary of the Applicant's Response

Apart from the results of Treatment Period 2, the only differences between the Study 110 Treatment Period 1 CSR (dated 25 February 2019; previously submitted within variation EMEA/H/C/003954/II/0049) and Study 110 Final CSR (dated 24 August 2020) are:

- the study description was edited to clarify the completion of Treatment Period 2;
- references to 'Treatment Cohort' were updated to 'Treatment Cohort Period 1' throughout to clearly differentiate from the Treatment Cohort Period 2 data;
-  Section  9.8.1.1  was  added  to  summarize  the  changes  in  study  conduct  due  to  the  COVID-19 pandemic; and
- typographical errors were corrected.

No changes or updates to the Treatment Period 1 data or results discussion were made in the Study 110 Final CSR.

## Question 3

3. The  MAH  should  clarify  what  kind  of  abnormal  findings  were  reported  in  the  subject  with previous normal Ophthalmological Examinations, that had abnormal lens findings on both eyes at  the  Early  Termination of  Treatment visit and provide information on the follow up of this event i.e. resolved/not.

## Summary of the Applicant's Response

Vertex has followed up with the site and ophthalmologist regarding the subject who had an abnormal lens finding on both eyes (though no lens opacity was reported; Study 110 CSR/ Listing 16.2.8.3a2) for  the  ophthalmological  examination  (OE)  at  the  Early  Termination  of  Treatment  (ETT)  visit.  The ophthalmologist has confirmed that the original worksheet was filled out incorrectly and that the lenses for both eyes were normal at the ETT visit.

A Study 110 CSR errata page correcting the error regarding the abnormal lens findings at the ETT visit for in the Study 110 Final CSR is submitted with this response.

## Assessment of the MAH's Response

The MAH followed up with the site and ophthalmologist regarding the subject who had an abnormal lens finding on both eyes at the Early Termination of Treatment visit.
