| WS/1518   | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC (Epclusa, Harvoni, Sovaldi) and 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2 (Vosevi) in order to add new information regarding the use of the sofosbuvir-containing products in patients with renal impairment, based on final results from studies GS-US-342-4062, GS-US- 337-4063 and GS-US-334-0154, listed as a category 3 study in the RMP and study GS-US-338-1125. Study GS-US-342-4062 was a phase 2, multi-centre, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 Weeks in subjects with chronic HCV infection who are on dialysis for end stage renal disease. Study GS-US-337-4063 was a phase 2, multi-centre, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in subjects with genotype 1, 4, 5 and 6 chronic HCV infection who are on dialysis for end stage renal disease. Study GS-US-334-0154 was a phase 2b, open label study of 200 mg or 400 mg Sofosbuvir+ribavirin for 24 Weeks in Genotype 1 or 3 HCV infected subjects with renal insufficiency. | 19/09/2019   | 21/10/2019 | SmPC and PL | Sofosbuvir in a fixed dose combination with ledipasvir was administered for 12 weeks to 18 patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C and severe renal impairment in an open-label study (Study 0154). The safety of sofosbuvir in a fixed dose combination with either ledipasvir or velpatasvir has been studied in 154 patients with ESRD requiring dialysis (Study 4062 and Study 4063). In this setting, exposure of sofosbuvir metabolite GS-331007 is 20-fold increased, exceeding levels where adverse reactions have been observed in preclinical trials. In this limited clinical safety data set, the rate of adverse events and deaths was not clearly elevated from what is expected in ESRD patients. The CHMP considered that safety data on the use of the sofosbuvir-based products in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis are limited. Overall, the CHMP concluded that the sofosbuvir-based products can be used in these patients with no dose adjustment when no other relevant treatment options are available. |

Furthermore, section 4.3 of the Sovaldi SmPC was updated in order to remove the use of rifabutin as a contraindication. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes throughout the Product Information. | 04/07/2019 | 23/09/2019 | SmPC and PL | Based on results from study GS-US-334-2130, effects of rifabutin and carbamazepine administration on the drug levels of sofosbuvir have been updated throughout the Product Information. With regards to the rifabutin interaction, a 28% reduction in sofosbuvir exposure was observed. Considering that reduction in sofosbuvir dose of <50% is expected to be safe in terms of potentially reduced efficacy, the CHMP concluded that the data support removal of co- administration of rifabutin as contraindication from the Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) Product Information. The contraindication is maintained for Epclusa, Harvoni and Vosevi, given the lack of data on interactions with the other active substances contained in these combination products. The data available for interactions with carbamazepine indicated that sofosbuvir levels were reduced by 48%, but the confidence interval included the 50% value.
