## 1. Introduction

On  19/10/2018,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Lonquex  (lipegfilgrastim),  in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The  MAH  states  that  study  XM22-08  is  part  of  the  company  overall  paediatric  clinical  development program. A forthcoming variation application, consisting of the full paediatric relevant data package (i.e. containing several studies) is expected to be submitted. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed.

Lonquex (lipegfilgrastim) has been developed for the prevention and management of chemotherapyinduced neutropenia. It was approved for use in adults by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2013 with the therapeutic indications: Lonquex is indicated in adults for reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes).

The  Applicant  agreed  on  paediatric  investigation  plan  (PIP)  in  2011  and  the  subsequent  PIP modifications were agreed in September 2017 (EMEA-001019-PIP01-10-M04).

The primary objective of the PIP Phase 1 Study XM22-07 was to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of lipegfilgrastim, with assessment of pharmacodynamics, efficacy, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity as secondary objectives.

The  primary  objective  of  the  PIP  Phase  2  Study  XM22-08,  was  to  investigate  in  paediatric  patients diagnosed with Ewing Family of Tumours or Rhabdomyosarcoma receiving chemotherapy, the efficacy of multiple doses of lipegfilgrastim (administered once per cycle) compared with filgrastim (administered  several  times  per  cycle) (Lipegfilgrastim  100  μg/kg  body  weight  in  comparison  to Filgrastim 5 μg/kg body we ight); secondary objectives were to assess pharmacodynamics, PK, safety, tolerability,  and  immunogenicity. The efficacy data obtained from the Phase 1 and 2 studies will be extrapolated to the children less than 2 years of age.

The  current  submission  is  (in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006)  the addendum (follow-up period) to the clinical study report XM22-08 (already assessed in the procedure EMA/H/C/002556/P46/017, with UK acting as the Rapporteur for the procedure). The last patient last visit  of  the  follow  up  period  for  study  XM22-08  was  8  January  2019.  The  current  addendum  report contains the follow up data on survival, cancer status, growth (height and weight), concomitant G-CSF, serious adverse events (SAEs), and immunogenicity.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Lonquex (lipegfilgrastim) is a glyco-polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated formulation of a recombinant Nmethionyl human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (r-metHuG-CSF) that has been developed for the prevention of CTX-induced neutropenia. In Study XM22-08, lipegfilgrastim was supplied in glass vials containing 1 mL sterile, clear, colourless to pale yellow, preservative-free solution for sc injection

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

consisting  of  lipegfilgrastim  at  a  concentration  of  10  mg/mL  as  well  as  excipients  (acidic  sodium acetate buffer, sorbitol [E420], polysorbate 20, and water for injection), especially developed for the lipegfilgrastim  paediatric  studies.  The  maximum  dose  was  to  be 6  mg,  as  this  is  the  fixed  dose  for adults. Injection of lipegfilgrastim was to be made using a fine graded syringe (grading mark 0.01 mL). After  the  syringe  was  filled  with  lipegfilgrastim,  the  needle  was  to  be  changed.  Injection  was  to  be made with a new 27G x½-inch injection needle. The abdomen was the preferred location for injection.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH has submitted an addendum report of Study XM22-08 containing data from the follow up period. The final report from study XM22-08 was assessed by the UK (EMA/H/C/002556/P46/017).

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Study XM22-08

## Description

## Methods

The methods of the study below were described in the Rapporteurs (UK) assessment report (below in italics)  dated  21 st   of  March,  2019  (EMEA/H/C/002556/P46/017).  The  current  report  concerns  the follow-up data collected on Day 180 (±2 weeks) and Day 365 (±2 weeks) including survival, cancer status,  growth  (height  and  weight),  concomitant  G-CSF,  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  and immunogenicity.

## Objectives (primary study)

Primary  Objective :  Assess  the  efficacy  of  a  single  sc  dose  of  100  μg/kg  body  weight  (BW)  of lipegfilgrastim per cycle compared to daily sc doses of 5 μg/kg BW of filgrastim in children receiving CTX.

Secondary Objective : Assess pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a single sc dose of 100 μg/kg BW of lipegfilgrastim per cycle compared to daily 5 μg/kg BW of filgrastim doses.

## Study design

A Phase 2, multicenter, openlabel, randomized, active -controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, PK, pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of lipegfilgrastim at a dose of 100 μg/kg body weight (BW) in comparison with filgrastim at daily doses of 5 μg/kg BW in paediatric patients diagnosed with the Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy (CTX).

Screening  period  of  up  to  2  weeks  with  a  treatment  period  for  a  maximum  of  18  weeks,  which consisted of 4 cycles of CTX of 21 days each with an allowance of 14-day delay between each CTX cycle;  and  a  followup  period  of  up  to  365  days  from  first  investigational  medicinal  product  (IMP) administration. An end of study (EOS)/or early termination (ET) visit was pe rformed 4 weeks after the start of the last CTX [±3 days]). Followup visits were performed on days 180 (±2 weeks) and 365 (±2 weeks) after the first IMP administration.

## Study population /Sample size

For the primary study three groups of patients stratified by age (2 to &lt;6 years, 6 to &lt;12 years, and 12 to &lt;18 years) were enrolled. Recruitment of the youngest age group began only after results of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and safety data of 3 patients from the middle age group, who had completed  the  treatment  phase  with  lipegfilgrastim,  had  been  reviewed  by  the  Data  Monitoring Committee and no significant safety signals for lipegfilgrastim that could prevent recruitment in the youngest age stratum had been detected.

Table 1: Composition of the study population

| TreatmentArm                                   | Age group     | Age group    | Age group     | Total   |

BW=body weight

## Treatments

In each of the treatment cycles of CTX, lipegfilgrastim or filgrastim were administered sc on day 1 of a cycle approximately 24 hours (+6 hours) after the end of the last CTX administration in week 1 of the specific regimen. The corresponding study day 1 in different CTX regimens was calculated as shown below:

- ifosfamide plus vincristine plus actinomycin D (IVA): CTX -day 2+1
- vincristine  plus  actinomycin  D  plus  cyclophosphamide  (VAC):  CTX -day  1+1,  CTX-day  2+1, CTX-day 3+1, or CTX-day 5+1 (depending on the actinomycin schedule and the number of days cyclophosphamide was given)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- ifosfamide plus vincristine plus actinomycin D plus doxorubicin (IVADo): CTX -day 2+1
- vincristine plus doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide alternating with ifosfamide plus etoposide (VDC/IE): CTX -day 2+1 during cycles 1 and 3, and CTX-day 5+1 during cycles 2 and 4
- vincristine plus ifosfamide plus doxorubicin plus etoposide (VIDE): CTX -day 3+1

## Outcomes/endpoints (primary study)

Primary Efficacy Measure(s) and Endpoint(s) : Duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in cycle 1, defined as the number of days with severe neutropenia in cycle 1 (from start of CTX until day 15). Severe neutropenia was defined as Grade 4 neutropenia with AN C &lt;0.5 × 10 9 /L. If the ANC did not drop below 0.5 × 10 9 /L, the DSN was set to 0.

## Secondary Efficacy Measures and Endpoints :

- Incidence of severe neutropenia in each cycle (1 to 4).
- Incidence of very severe neutropenia in each cycle (1 to 4).
- Incidence of febrile neutropenia per cycle and across all cycles.
- DSN in cycles 2 to 4 per cycle.
- Duration of very severe neutropenia (DVSN) in cycles 1 to 4 per cycle.

Efficacy evaluations were performed on blood samples taken for the pharmacodynamic assessments in combination with temperature measurements with following definition:

- Severe neutropenia: neutropenia with ANC &lt;0.5 × 10 9 /L.
- Very severe neutropenia: ANC &lt;0.1 × 10 9 /L.
- Incidence of febrile neutropenia: body temperature &gt;38.3°C or 2 consecutive readings higher than 37.8°C measured at axilla or external ear at least 2 hours apart; and ANC &lt;0.5 × 10 9 /L or expected to be &lt;0.5 × 10 9 /L per cycle and across all cycles.

## Secondary Pharmacodynamic Measures and Endpoints:

- Area under the curve of ANC (AUC ANC) until day 15 in cycle 1.
- ANC nadir, e.g., the lowest ANC value recorded, per cycle.
- Time to ANC nadir per cycle, defined as the time from start of CTX until occurrence of the ANC nadir in the cycle.
- Time to ANC nadir per cycle, defined as the time from first IMP admin istration in a cycle until occurrence of the ANC nadir in the cycle.
- Time to ANC recovery (ANC &gt;1.0 × 10 9 /L and ANC &gt;2.0 × 10 9 /L) from first day of CTX.
- Time to ANC recovery (ANC &gt;1.0 × 10 9 /L and ANC &gt;2.0 × 10 9 /L) from nadir per cycle.

Safety  Variables : Safety  of  the  IMPs  was  evaluated  based  on  the  assessment  of  adverse  events, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory parameters, immunogenicity, spleen sonography, and concomitant medications.

## Tolerability Measures and Endpoints:

- Local tolerability  at the  study  drug  injection  site  was  assessed  at  1  hour  (±10  minutes)  and  24 hours (±1 hour) following lipegfilgrastim or filgrastim first administration at each cycle. (site was assessed for the presence and severity of pain, erythema/redness, ecchymosis, and induration).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- number (%) of patients who failed to complete the study.
- number (%) of patients who failed to complete the study due to adverse events.

In addition, the effects of treatment on mortality due to infections and overall mortality until end of followup period were examined. First patient first visit was on 08 September 2015 and last patient last visit of the treatment period was 18 April 2018. A few of the patients are still in the follow-up phase of the study.

## Statistical Methods

Documentation of statistical methods used in this study is provided in Statistical Analyses Plan in the submitted  data  for  the  original  P46  application.  The  sample  size  of  42  patients  (21  patients  per treatment  group)  has  been  chosen  primarily  on  practical  grounds  and  feasibility  (expected  low recruitment rate in the population under investigation).

Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set included all randomized patients. Treatment was assigned based on the treatment to which patients were randomized, regardless of which treatment they received.

Safety Analysis Set included all randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of IMP. Treatment was assigned based upon the treatment patients received, regardless of the treatment to which they were assigned.

Per-Protocol (PP) Analysis Set included all patients for whom no protocol violations were reported that may have impacted the efficacy of the IMP. For the purpose of the exclusion of a patient data from PP Analysis Set the following criteria were used:

- a. violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria
- b. intake of the prohibited concomitant medications
- c. received &lt;75% of the intended study medication dose
- d. received non -randomized study medication
- e. violation of the GCP criteria resulting in t he exclusion of the patient data from the study

f. no treatment with randomized study medication in cycle 1

g. insufficient ANC data for efficacy evaluatio n, specifically, at least 5 ANC assessments were required between day 2 to day 15

The above criteria only applied to CTX cycle 1 of the treatment phase. Of note, only those violations falling into categories 'a' to 'g' lead to exclusions if they influenced the interpretability of the efficacy study  results.  Determination  of  the  exclusions  from  the  PP  Anal ysis  Set  was  completed  and documented prior to the database lock. The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set included all patients from the safety  population  who  received  lipegfilgrastim  in  cycle  1  and  had  at  least  1  pharmacokinetic assessment available for evaluati on.

In total, 15 patients had protocol violations during the follow -up period. The most common protocol violations were related to study -specific requirements for SAE reporting. According to the Applicant the protocol violations did not impact the outcome of the study or the interpretation of study results.

## Results (follow-up period)

The current assessment relates to the Study XM22-08 follow-up period only.

The results of the primary study were included in the final report dated 21 st  of March 2019 (Procedure no.: EMEA/H/C/002556/P46/017).

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

Altogether  40  patients  completed  Day  180  follow-up,  21  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group  and  19  in  the filgrastim  group.  Out  of  these,  37  patients  completed  Day  365  follow-up,  20  in  the  lipegfilgrastim group  and  17  in  the  filgrastim  group.  Two  patients  died  during  the  follow-up  period,  both  in  the filgrastim  group.  One  patient  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group  died  shortly  after  Day  365  follow-up completion.

The  mean duration  of  follow-up  was  269.1  days  (SD=9.85,  range:  247  to  288).  This  duration  was similar  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  mean  duration  of  follow-up  was  also  similar  across  all  age groups. The mean duration of study and follow-up was 369.7 days (SD=6.68, range: 353 to 384).

a IncludesPatient in the lipegfilgrastim group who died after Day 365 follow-up completion

ITT=intent-to-treat; N=total number of patients; n=number of patients.

## Rapporteur's comments:

The  number  of  deaths  during  the  follow  up  period  were  related  to  the  disease  progression  and  no significant imbalance or trend in the number of events of disease progression or death was identified to be associated with the lipegfilgrastim treatment comparing to the filgrastim treatment.

## Survival and Cancer Status in the Follow-up Period

Kaplan  Meier  estimates  for  25%,  50%  and  75%  survival  time  were  non-estimable  due  to  the  low number of death cases. All the deaths were reported after Day 180 of the follow-up.

The grade of rhabdomyosarcoma was 3 or 4 in all evaluated patients (lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim group)  except  one  patient  in  filgrastim  group  (grade  2)  in  both  D180  and  D365  time  points.  No significant difference in cancer status by T-, N-, M-classification was seen between the D180 and D365 time points were seen in either treatment groups. Neither the disease stage of rhabdomyosarcoma or Ewing Family of tumors patients changed between the follow up time points. Only difference in figures was  the  lower  number  of  missing  evaluations  at  the  D365  visit.  Furthermore,  the  groups  were comparable in stage and grade of the cancer.

## Rapporteur's comments:

The statistical evaluation of the survival was not possible due to the low number of events. Based on the provided descriptive data no clear difference in survival during the follow up period was seen in different age groups or treatments.

No significant differences between treatments (lipegfilgratim vs. filgrastim) were seen in progression of cancer by the data from D180 and D365 follow up visits, in either treatment group. Furthermore, the groups  were  balanced  by  the  cancer  status.  However,  the  reliable  evaluation  of  the  impact  of  the treatment on cancer progression is impossible to perform based on the data due to the low number of subjects and other confounding factors (other treatments).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Weight and Height Values and Changes from Baseline in the Follow up Period

The  mean  increase  in  weight  from  baseline  to  end  of  follow-up  was  3.17  kg  (SD=5.64)  in  the lipegfilgrastim group and 3.22 kg (SD=3.66) in the filgrastim group.

The  mean  increase  in  height  from  baseline  to  end  of  follow-up  was  3.5  cm  (SD=2.7)  in  the lipegfilgrastim group and 4.1 cm (SD=2.6) in the filgrastim group.

## Rapporteur's comments:

No significant differences between the treatments (lipegfilgrastim vs. filgrastim) were seen in weight or height development. However, the reliable evaluation of the impact of treatment on development is not possible to perform  due to the low number of subjects and other confounding factors (general condition and other treatments).

## Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor Therapy in the Follow-up Period

The majority of patients (30 out of 40 who entered follow-up) received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy during the follow-up period (Table 6). 13 of 21 (62%) patients in the filgrastim group and 17 of 21 (81%) patients in the lipegfilgrastim group. The frequency of G-CSF treatment by background chemotherapy was also similar between groups.

## Rapporteur's comments:

Larger percentage of patients received G-CSF therapy in the lipegfilgrastim group comparing to the filgrastim group (81% vs. 62%). The relatively higher frequency of G-CSF treatment in the follow up period  in  lipegfilgrastim  group  did  not  have  an  impact  on  efficacy  and  safety  of  between  groups. However, any firm conclusions cannot be made based on the data due to the low number of patients and confounding factors.

## Safety results

## Serious Adverse Events in the Follow-up Period

A  total  of  18  patients  had  at  least  1  SAE  during  the  follow-up  period  (Table  7).  SAEs  were  most commonly Grade 4 in severity, 11/21 and 4/21 in lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim groups, respectively. The corresponding frequencies of Grade 3 SAEs were 2/21 and 1/21. Additionally in filgrastim group one Grade 1 SAE was seen. 3 Grade 5 SAEs (deaths) were seen, 1 in lipegfilgrastim and 2 in filgrastim groups.  The  most  common  SAEs  belonged  to  the  SOC  of  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders,  in particular thrombocytopenia (7 patients, 5 in lipegfilgrastim and 2 in filgrastim group), lymphopenia (6 patients altogether), and neutropenia (2 patients altogether). Other SAEs that occurred in more than

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

one  patient  were  lymphocyte  count  decreased  and  platelet  count  decreased  (3  patients  altogether each).  The  SAE  profile  was  similar  across  all  age  groups  with  4  (57%),  7  (88%)  and  2  (33%)  of patients having at least one SAE in three respective age groups (2 to &lt;6 years, 6 to &lt;12 years, 12 to &lt;18 years) in patients receiving lipegfilgrastim (100 μ g/kg). The corresponding numbers in patients receiving f ilgrastim (5 μg/kg) were 2 (29%) 1 (17%) 2 (25%), respectively.

Three patients had SAEs (one of these patients died shortly after Day 365 follow-up completion) after database lock for the Study XM22-08 CSR (04 June 2018).

The first of these patients had Ewing family of tumors  experienced a total of 3 serious adverse events, 2 events of lymphopenia and an event of peripheral primitive neuroectodermal bone tumour, which led to  death.  In  the  opinion  of  the  investigator  and  the  sponsor,  the  serious  adverse  events  of lymphopenia  were  not  related  to  lipegfilgrastim  but  related  to  the  concomitant  chemotherapy medication (vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, etoposide, plus sodium 2mercaptoethane sulfonate [MESNA]).

The  second  patient  had  rhabdomyosarcoma.  The  patient  experienced  a  total  of  14  serious  adverse events, including 13 events of lymphocyte count decreased and 1 event of platelet count decreased. The event resolved with sequelae on Study Day 205. The patient completed the 365-day follow-up visit on. In the opinion of the investigator and the sponsor, the serious adverse events of lymphocyte count decreased and platelet count decreased were not related to filgrastim but related to the concomitant chemotherapy  medication (ifosfamide, vincristine, Actinomycin D, doxorubicin plus sodium  2mercaptoethane sulfonate [MESNA], etoposide, idarubicin, and trofosfamide).

The  third  patient  had      rhabdomyosarcoma  .  The  patient  experienced  a  serious  adverse  event  of rhabdomyosarcoma. The outcome of the event was not resolved. The patient was lost to follow-up and she did not complete the 365-day follow-up visit. In the opinion of the investigator and the sponsor, the serious adverse event of rhabdomyosarcoma was not related to lipegfilgrastim.

Preferred terms are sorted by descending order of incidence within system organ class for the lipegfilgrastim group. Patients are counted only once in each preferred term category, and only once in each system organ class category. MedDRA=Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; N=total number of patients; n=number of patients; SAE = serious adverse event.

## Rapporteur's comments:

Higher number of patients with at least one SAEs was seen in the lipegfilgrastim group compared to the filgrastim group (62% vs 24%). The frequency of patients experiencing SAE was on the same level in lipegfilgrastim group (~60% in both treatment groups) as in short term in the primary study. The respective percentage of patients in filgrastim groups was, however, significantly lower in the follow up period 24% vs. 60%). Regarding the single adverse reactions, the difference in the frequency of blood and lymphatic system disorders was higher in lipegfilgrastim group (43% vs. 14%). The similar trend of higher number of events of thrombocytopenia and leucopenia in lipegfilgrastim group was already seen  short  term  during  the  primary  study,  but  these  events  were  considered  not  to  be  treatment related in lipegfilgrastim group. There were also relatively high difference in SAEs by age groups and their concomitant treatments. Age-dependent difference in SAEs is though again difficult to evaluate due to the small number of patients per age group.

## Immunogenicity

## a) Anti-Drug Antibody Analysis

A total of 98 samples from 21 patients in the lipegfilgrastim group were collected during this study. For 1  patient,  samples  were  available  until  the  end  of  study  (EOS)/early  termination  (ET)  visit;  for  1 patient until Day 180, and for 19 patients until Day 365.

A total of 7 samples from 4 patients were confirmed positive for the presence of ADA. Three of these patients had positive samples at baseline and were considered to have pre-existing ADA not related to the treatment with lipegfilgrastim. One patient was negative at baseline, had an ADA response at Cycle 2 CTX Day 1 and at the EOS/ET visit; however, the Day 180 and Day 365 samples were negative. One patient with a confirmed positive sample at baseline also had a confirmed positive sample at Cycle 2 cytotoxic chemotherapy (CTX) Day 1 and at EOS/ET visit with a low concentration of antibodies (titer &lt;1) (Table 9). The Day 365 sample was negative for the detection of ADA (Table 9).

- b) Sample Analysis for Characterization and Neutralizing Antibodies

Characterization and titer assays were performed on the 7 samples (Table 9) confirmed for ADA presence (Table 8).

- 3 samples from patient  had specific binding to XM21 and/or G-CSF
- 3 samples from 3 different patients had exclusive specific binding to cPEG
- 1 sample (EOS/ET) from Patient did not present specific binding to cPEG
- Titers of the 7 samples confirmed positive for ADAs were low, and ranged between 0.0 and 0.8.

Two samples were positive for neutralization of XM22 activity. Since both samples with neutralizing activity were from baseline time points, detected NAbs were not considered to be treatment related.

## Rapporteur's comments:

The frequency of patients developing ADAs was low in lipegfilgrastim group during the follow up period with  four  positive  patients  altogether,  but  only  one  patient  who  had  no  ADAs  towards  G-CSF  at baseline.  Two  patients  ADA  positive  at  the  end  of  the  study  turned  negative  during  the  follow  up period. All these patients were ADA negative at FU/D365 time point. In the neutralization assay three patients had positive binding against PEG moiety, but only one of these was shown to be neutralizing. One patient had ADA positivity against G-CSF  showing neutralizing capacity at baseline, but turned negative at the end of the study. Altogether, two patients showed neutralizing antibodies, but since they were observed already at the baseline they were not related to the current treatment.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

## MAH's position on benefits and risks

Study XM22-08  was  the  second  paediatric study in the Company's  lipegfilgrastim paediatric development programme. Both studies were performed in paediatric patients 2 to &lt;18 years of age with Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma receiving CTX.

The  first  study  (XM22-07)  was  an  open-label,  non-controlled  study  performed  to  assess  the  PK, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a single, sc dose of 100 μg/kg BW lipegfilgrastim in 21 children.

The  second  study  XM22-08  was  an  open-label,  active-controlled  study  performed  to  assess  the efficacy, PK, pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of lipegfilgrastim 100 μg/kg BW in comparison to daily filgrastim 5 μg/kg BW in 42 children.

The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a single sc dose of 100 μg/kg BW of lipegfilgrastim per cycle compared to daily sc doses of 5 μg/kg BW of filgrastim in children receiving

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CTX.  Note  that  no  formal  hypothesis  testing  was  performed  as  the  study  was  not  powered  for  it; conclusions were limited to providing estimates of the means of treatments and their differences.

The difference in the DSN in Cycle 1 between the 2 treatment groups was not meaningful. The mean (SD) DSN in Cycle 1 in the lipegfilgrastim group was 2.7 (2.25) days and in the filgrastim group 2.5 (2.09) days (PP Analysis Set). A Poisson regression analysis with factors of treatment and age cohort, and baseline (before IMP administration) ANC value as covariate was fitted. The least squares mean difference  (lipegfilgrastim  minus  filgrastim)  was  1.0  (95%  CI:  -0.21,  2.26;  P  =  0.102)  in  the  PP Analysis Set and 0.4 (95% CI: -0.92, 1.72; P = 0.543) in the ITT Analysis Set. In addition, there were no  notable  differences  in  the  DSN  in  Cycle  1  between  the  corresponding  age  cohorts  across  the treatment groups. These results were consistent with the results obtained in Study XM22-07. In Study XM22-07, the mean (SD) DSN was 0.7 (1.2) days in the 2 to &lt;6 years age cohort, 2.4 (1.9) days in the 6 to &lt;12 years age cohort, and 3.1 (1.9) days in the 12 to &lt;18 years age cohort. In the current Study XM22-08, the mean (SD) DSN in the lipegfilgrastim group (PP Analysis Set) was 2.0 (1.55) days in the 2 to &lt;6 years age cohort, 2.8 (2.31) days in the 6 to &lt;12 years age cohort, and 3.3 (2.88) days in the 12 to &lt;18 years age cohort. Similar results for DSN were seen in the filgrastim group.

In addition, in both treatment groups, the mean DSN in patients who received doxorubicin-based CTX VDC/IE and VIDE in Cycle 1 was longer compared to the patients who received other CTX regimens (IVA or VAC). Of the 2 most frequent CTX regimens administered in the study (IVA and VIDE), the mean (SD) DSN  was  shorter  for  patients  who  received  IVA  compared  to  VIDE  (lipegfilgrastim:  0.4 [0.53] days vs 4.1 [1.54] days; filgrastim: 0.4 [0.79] days vs 3.9 [1.13] days; PP Analysis Set). This could  be  attributed  to  the  higher  myelotoxicity  expected  with  doxorubicin-based  CTX  regimens, particularly  for  the  older  paediatric  patients  (6  to  &lt;12  years  and  12  to  &lt;18  years)  who  received  a higher proportion of the VIDE CTX regimen as compared to other CTX regimens. In summary, as the type of CTX regimen administered was different across the age cohorts, no clear conclusion can be drawn regarding a relationship between DSN and the age of the patients.

The results of the secondary endpoints of the study were supportive of the primary endpoint results. There were no meaningful differences between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups with respect  to  the  incidence  of  severe  neutropenia  (85%  vs  84%),  febrile  neutropenia  (35%  vs  42%), hospitalization due to febrile neutropenia (5% in each treatment group), DSN in Cycles 2 to 4 (~2 days in  both  groups),  and  DVSN  (~1  day  in  both  groups).  Also  no  relevant  differences  between  the corresponding age cohorts were found.

As in Study XM22-07, a trend of higher incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients who received VIDE CTX compared to other CTX regimens was observed also in this study.

This  is  in  line  with  published  data  in  paediatric  patients  with  Ewing  sarcoma,  in  which  patients developed  febrile  neutropenia  after  78%  of  VIDE  cycles  with  pegfilgrastim  administration  and  after 56% VIDE cycles with filgrastim. After less myelosuppressive IVA and VAC CTX, the incidence of febrile neutropenia was 0% with pegfilgrastim and 5% with filgrastim administration (Wendelin et al 2005). André et  al.  reported  febrile  neutropenia  in  47%  of  pegfilgrastim-treated  paediatric  cancer  patients after VIDE, 4% after VAC, and 33% (2 of 6 cases) after IVA (André et al 2007).

However, when the results of Study XM22-08 were stratified by CTX regimen in Cycle 1, there were no differences in the overall likelihood of experiencing febrile neutropenia between  any  of the corresponding age cohorts of the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups. Similarly, there was no difference in the overall likelihood of experiencing febrile neutropenia irrespective of concomitant prophylactic systemic antibiotics use between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups.

The pharmacodynamic results in this study provided additional evidence supporting similar efficacy of lipegfilgrastim  as  compared  to  filgrastim.  The  geometric  mean  AUCANC  until  day  15  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lipegfilgrastim group was higher compared to the filgrastim group (104.9473 × 10 9 /L*days vs 84.2795 × 10 9 /L*days; PP Analysis Set). When the results were stratified by age cohorts and the CTX regimen administered in Cycle 1, there were no meaningful differences in the mean AUCANC values between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups and between the corresponding age strata/cohorts. Also,  there  were  no  meaningful  differences  between  the  2  treatment  groups  in  the  mean  AUCANC values in Cycle 1, mean ANC nadir values in Cycles 1 to 4, mean time to ANC nadir in Cycles 1 to 4 from start of CTX or IMP administration, and mean times to ANC recovery thresholds of ANC &gt;1.0 × 10 9 /L and ANC &gt;2.0 × 10 9 /L in Cycles 1 to 4.

The  study  treatment  duration  was  similar  between  treatment  groups  (mean:  100.8  days  in  the lipegfilgrastim group and 95.0 days in the filgrastim group). Overall, lipegfilgrastim was administered 4 times (mean value; once per cycle for 4 cycles), and filgrastim was administered 31.7 times (mean value)  over  4  cycles.  Lipegfilgrastim  could  be  advantageous  over  filgrastim  owing  to  its  lesser frequency of administration (once per cycle) and increased compliance compared to daily administration of filgrastim.

No concerns about the safety of lipegfilgrastim were raised by the TEAEs reported in the study. All enrolled patients experienced at least 1 TEAE during the treatment period of the study. There were no notable differences in the incidences of various categories of TEAEs between the 2 treatment groups. The numerical differences in the reporting of PTs between the groups were considered due to chance. The most common ( ≥ 30% patients in both the treatment groups) system organ classes included blood and lymphatic system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions,  investigations,  and  infections  and  infestations.  Anaemia,  common  in  cancer  patients undergoing CTX, was reported for approximately 80% of patients in each treatment group. The other most common ( ≥ 50% patients) PTs were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and vomiting.

Treatment-related TEAEs were rare and reported in 19% of patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 10% of patients in the filgrastim group, and were mild or moderate in severity (Grade 1 or 2).

Any Grade 3 TEAEs were reported in 76% of patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 62% of patients in the filgrastim group. The most frequently reported Grade 3 TEAE at PT level was anemia (52% of patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 38% of patients in the filgrastim group). All other Grade 3 TEAEs were reported in 0 to 5 (24%) patients per treatment group. Any Grade 4 TEAEs were reported in 76% of patients in each of the treatment groups. The most frequently reported Grade 4 TEAEs ( ≥ 30% of patients in any group) were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and leukopenia. All other Grade 4 TEAEs were reported in 0 to 4 (19%) patients per treatment group. Approximately 60% of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  experienced  SAEs  during  the  treatment  period  of  the  study. Among all SAEs, only 1 SAE was considered treatment-related and occurred in the filgrastim group (Grade 1 pyrexia). Adverse events leading to study discontinuation were uncommon and reported only for 2 patients, both in the filgrastim group and in the age cohort of 12 to &lt;18 years. The events were leukopenia and neutropenia in 1 patient and drug-induced liver injury in the other patient. The events were considered related to CTX but not to filgrastim treatment by the investigator.

There were no unexpected clinically meaningful trends observed in the mean changes from baseline for any  of  the  serum  chemistry  or  hematology  parameters  during  the  study.  The  assessment  of  the ventricular repolarization risk based on the change from baseline QT interval corrected by Fridericia correction formula did not indicate that a single dose of lipegfilgrastim of 100 μg/kg per cycle holds any  QTc  liability.  Evaluation  of  other  ECG  time  intervals  demonstrated  the  absence  of  potential meaningful drug-induced change in heart rate, prolongation of PR or QRS duration, as well as clinically relevant abnormalities following lipegfilgrastim administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  mean duration  of  follow-up  was  269.1  days  (SD=9.85,  range:  247  to  288).  This  duration  was similar in both treatment groups and across all age groups. The mean duration of study and follow-up was 369.7 days (SD=6.68, range: 353 to 384).

In all, 18 out of 40 patients had SAEs during follow-up. The  most  common  SAEs  were thrombocytopenia (7 patients), lymphopenia (6 patients), and neutropenia (2 patients). Other SAEs that occurred in more than one patient were lymphocyte count decreased and platelet count decreased (3 patients each). This SAE profile was similar across all age groups.

Two  patients  died  during  the  follow-up  period,  both  in  the  filgrastim  group.  One  patient  in  the lipegfilgrastim  group  died  shortly  after  day  365  follow-up  completion.  All  3  deaths  occurred  due  to disease progression.

Seven samples from 4 patients had positive results for the presence of ADA. Three of these patients had positive samples already at baseline and, for this reason, were considered to have pre-existing ADA not lipegfilgrastim treatment-related.

The safety results  in  this  study  were  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  lipegfilgrastim  and were similar to the safety profile of filgrastim indicating its safe use in children with Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma receiving CTX.

## MAH's position on limitations of the XM22-08 Study Design

The XM22-08 study was designed as the second of 2 paediatric studies required as measures of a PIP, with the primary objective to assess the efficacy of a single dose of lipegfilgrastim 100 μg/kg BW in comparison to approved standard treatment with filgrastim in the paediatric population. As such, an open-label, active-controlled study was considered appropriate to support the primary objective of this study.

The sample size of 42 patients (21 patients per treatment group) was selected based on practicality and feasibility (expected low recruitment rate in the population under investigation). A sample size of 21 patients per treatment group was expected to allow the estimation of mean DSN in Cycle 1.

Study  XM22-08  investigated  4  cycles  of  lipegfilgrastim  treatment,  which  reflects  a  typical  clinical setting. To facilitate recruitment of cancer patients from the age of 2 to &lt;18 years, 5 different CTX regimens were permissible in Study XM22-08. As the myelosuppressive effect of CTX varies across CTX regimen, the comparison of results across age groups can be complicated when the CTX regimens are not  equally  distributed  by  age  group.  This  was  indeed  the  case  in  the  XM22-08  study,  but  was addressed by appropriate analysis of the study data by type of CTX in addition to age group.

## MAH's overall benefitrisk assessment of lipegfilgrastim in p aediatric patients

Studies XM22-07 and XM22-08 investigated 21 and 42 paediatric patients, respectively, with Ewing family of tumors or rhabdomyosarcoma who received a single sc injection of lipegfilgras tim 100 μg/kg BW per CTX cycle.

In Study XM22-08 it was shown that there were no notable differences in the DSN in Cycle 1 across the treatment groups and between the corresponding age cohorts, and the results raised no concerns regarding the PK, safety, or immunogenicity profile of lipegfilgrastim.

In the PK Study XM22-07, maximum mean serum lipegfilgrastim concentration (Cmax) was reached at (tmax) 50.3 hours (292 ±178 ng/mL) in the 2 to &lt;6 years group, 45.4 hours (303 ±144 ng/mL) in the 6 to &lt;12 years group, and 82.2 hours (341 ±381 ng/mL) in the 12 to &lt;18 years group. Analysis of covariance revealed no detectable difference in PK parameters of interest (Cmax, area under the serum concentration-time  curve,  apparent  volume  of  distribution  during  the  terminal  phase  after  non-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

intravenous administration, and apparent clearance) among age groups. More importantly, the average Cmax values and Cmax variability were comparable across the age groups, supporting the use of a BWadjusted dose to achieve comparable initial peak exposure levels of lipegfilgrastim.

Key efficacy endpoints in clinical studies with G-CSFs are the incidence of febrile neutropenia and the DSN.  Results  for  these  endpoints  in  the  non-controlled  Study  XM22-07  as  well  as  in  the  activecontrolled  Study  XM22-08  (comparing  lipegfilgrastim  with  filgrastim,  which  is  approved  for  use  in paediatric  cancer  patients)  are  consistent  with  those  previously  observed  with  pegfilgrastim  and filgrastim and appear to be associated with the type of CTX administered rather than the age of the patients. As the type of CTX administered differed across the age groups, no clear conclusion can be drawn regarding a relationship between efficacy and the age of the patients. Similar trends were seen with the pharmacodynamic results. Safety endpoints in these trials included adverse events, clinical laboratory  results,  ECG  results,  spleen  sonography,  injection  site  reactions,  and  immunogenicity. Survival in the follow-up period was assessed in Study XM22-07. The evaluations indicated a safety profile consistent with that seen in adult trials with lipegfilgrastim.

The  death  of  1  child  with  rhabdomyosarcoma  during  the  follow-up  period  in  Study  XM22-07  was attributed to disease progression and was not regarded as lipegfilgrastim-related. In Study XM22-08, the 2 deaths observed  in the filgrastim group  during the follow-up period (1 patient with rhabdomyosarcoma and 1 patient with Ewing sarcoma) and the 1 death observed in the lipegfilgrastim group shortly after day 365 follow-up completion, were also attributed to disease progression and not considered treatment-related.

Regarding the immunogenicity in Study XM22-07, 1 patient developed a low titer ADA response in this study post-treatment with lipegfilgrastim and several doses of commercial filgrastim. The patient had a positive  sample  at  day  180  only.  This  sample  was  not  neutralizing  and  only  specific  for  the  cPEGmoiety. Four other patients were considered to have pre-existing ADA towards lipegfilgrastim (specific for cPEG or both G-CSF and cPEG moieties), but there was no treatment-related ADA response.

In Study XM22-08, immunogenicity data were obtained only for patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 7 samples from 4 patients were identified with confirmed presence of ADAs, including 3 patients with pre-existing ADAs (ie, positive baseline samples). A single patient was baseline negative and had ADA positive samples at Cycle 2 CTX-day 1 and at the EOS/ET visit, but negative samples on day 180 and day 365.The 2 positive samples, at Cycle 2 CTX-day 1 and at EOS/ET, had a low titer (&lt;1). The Cycle 2 sample for this patient had a titer of 0.5 for anticPEG but no anti-G-CSF specific antibodies were detected. In the EOS/ET sample, no ADA titer could be measured (0.0) due to very low ADA concentration.  The  Cycle  2  sample  was  non-neutralizing  and  the  EOS/ET  sample  result  was  not available.

In  conclusion  for  these  2  studies,  no  patient  developed  a  persistent  ADA  response,  and  all  positive samples had low titers and were not neutralizing.

Overall,  the  safety,  PK,  efficacy,  and  pharmacodynamic  data  reviewed  in  these  2  trials  support  a continued positive benefit-risk assessment for lipegfilgrastim in the paediatric population.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The final report for the assessment of the paediatric study for Lonquex (lipegfilgrastim) XM22-08 was provided on the 21 st  of March, 2019. The current assessment relates to the addendum of this study, data    from  the  follow  up  period  of  the    study  collected  on  Day  180  (±2  weeks)  and  Day  365  (±2 weeks); and includes data on survival, cancer status, growth (height and weight), concomitant G-CSF, serious adverse events (SAEs), and immunogenicity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  general,  the  data  provided  has  inherent  limitations  as  it  was  not  powered  for  proper  statistical evaluation of the data. Also, the number of patients in different age subcategories was too low to make any firm conclusions.

Altogether  3  patients  of  42  patients  continuing  the  study  died  during  the  follow  up  period  with  1 patient from the lipegfilgrastim group. No trends on increased progression of the underlying disease or mortality was seen associated with lipegfilgrastim in comparison to filgrastim group. Nevertheless, the evaluation  of  the  impact  of  the  treatment  on  mortality  or  disease  progression  is  limited  due  to  low number of  study  subjects  and  confounding  factors.  Based  on  the  data  provided  no  clear  difference between lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim was seen in survival or cancer progression.

The percentage of patients with SAE's was higher in lipegfilgrastim group to filgrastim group (62% vs. 24%) relating  mainly  to  differences  in  haematological  changes  (thrombocytopenia  and  leukopenia), which though might also be caused by the underlying disease. However, the percentage of patients experiencing  SAE's  in  lipegfilgrastim  group  did  not  differ  from  the  data  obtained  from  the  primary study  period  demonstrating  the  same  trend  of  increased  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  in lipegfilgrastim. These events were not though considered to be treatment-related.

Immunogenicity analysis did not indicate any significant importance for the efficacy or safety of the lipegfilgrastim since any neutralizing antibodies not already present at the baseline were observed. The development  of  ADA's  was  altogether  low  with  only  4  patients  affected  of  whom  3  were  positive already at baseline indicating no relationship of these events with the Lonquex.

Overall, the current data provided did not reveal any additional issues not already brought up in the previous assessment of the article 46 commitment (Procedure No: EMEA/H/C/002556/P46/017). Thus, the recommendations presented in the final report regarding the update of the product information are valid and should be followed, and the MAH has agreed to submit a paediatric extension of the current MA of Lonquex once the totality of paediatric data is available (planned for 07/2020), so the totality of the paediatric data can be assessed for a paediatric indication and a suitable paediatric formulation and paediatric dosage form.

<!-- image -->

## Fulfilled:

In view of the available data regarding Lonquex, the MAH should submit an extension of the current MA of Lonquex in accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. This should be provided as planned by the Company once the totality of paediatric data is available , so the totality of the paediatric data can be assessed for a paediatric indication and a suitable paediatric formulation and paediatric dosage form.
