## 5. Introduction

Brintellix  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  major  depressive  episodes  in  adults.  The  starting  and recommended dose of Brintellix film-coated tablets is 10 mg vortioxetine once daily in adults less than 65 years of age.

The clinical development programme for vortioxetine in paediatric patients, aged 7 to 17 years, with MDD is being conducted as part of the agreed PIP for vortioxetine (P/0234/2018). The PIP consists of 6 clinical  studies:  1  open-label,  PK  study  with  a  long-term,  extension  period  (12708A);  1  short-term, double-blind study in children (12709A); 1 short-term, double-blind study in adolescents (12710A); 2 long-term, OLE studies in children and adolescents (12712A and B); and 1 long-term, double-blind, relapse-prevention study in children and adolescents (13546A). Both the FDA and the EMA waived the obligation to submit the results of studies in MDD with vortioxetine in children aged less than 7 years.

submitted and assessed in 2015 (EMEA-H-C-2717/P46 003). The current submission includes a synopsis of this study as well as a description of the key results in the clinical overview and clinical summary documents.

## 6. Clinical aspects

## 6.1. Pharmacokinetics

Study 12708A was conducted to investigate the PK of vortioxetine in children and adolescents with a DSM-IV-TR™  diagnosis  of  depressive  or  anxiety  disorder.  In  addition  to  Study  12708A,  the  PK  of vortioxetine in adolescents with MDD was evaluated in Study 12710A using a popPK approach.

Since study 12708A was assessed previously, only the key aspects of this study are repeated in this report.

## Methods - analysis of data submitted

## Study 12708A

Study  12708A  was  an  open-label  study  evaluating  the  PK  and  tolerability  of  vortioxetine  and  its metabolites Lu AA34443 and Lu AA39835 following multiple oral dosing with vortioxetine tablets (5, 10, 15, or 20 mg/day) in children (aged 7 to 11 years) and adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years) with a DSMIV-TR™ diagnosis of depressive or anxiety disorder.

The study consisted of a main study period and an optional 6-month extension period. PK parameters were only evaluated during the main study period.

A total of 48 patients were planned for enrolment. The main study period consisted of 8 cohorts, each including 6 patients. Adolescent patients ≥ 12 and &lt;18 years of age were allocated to Adolescent Cohorts (ACs) 1 to 4 and children ≥ 7 and &lt;12 years of age were allocated to Child Cohorts (CCs) 1 to 4.

- This included 2, 4, or 6 days of up-titration for patients assigned to vortioxetine 10, 15, or 20mg/day. a respectively.

Blood samples for PK analysis were collected before the first dose of vortioxetine on Day 1 and 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, and 24 hours after the first dose. In addition, on the last treatment day of the main study period (Day 14, 16, 18, or 20 for patients in the 5, 10, 15, or 20mg/day group, respectively) after the patient's final dose of vortioxetine, blood samples were collected at the same time points as on Day 1. Due to semi-sparse PK sampling, the PK parameters were estimated using popPK analysis (non-linear mixed effect model).

## · PopPK analysis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In order to reduce the complexity of the popPK model and increase the chance of convergence, each analyte, that is, vortioxetine and Lu AA34443, were modelled separately instead performing of a full integrated model. Since more than 50% of the Lu AA39835 plasma concentrations were below the lower limit of quantification, no PK analyses were performed for Lu AA39835.

The initial structural models were a 2-compartment model for vortioxetine and a 1-compartment model for Lu AA34443 with first-order absorption and elimination and lag time. Individual values for CL/F, Vss/F (V2+V3) and the secondary parameters tmax, Cmax, AUC0-24h, t½ and metabolic ratio (MR) were estimated.

The covariates evaluated were age, sex, body size (weight, height, body mass index [BMI], and lean body mass [LBM]), ADHD diagnosis, and co-medication with a stimulant.

## Study 12710A

Study 12710A was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active-reference (fluoxetine), fixeddose study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vortioxetine 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day after 8 weeks of treatment in adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years) with a DSM-5 ®  diagnosis of MDD. A total of 600 patients were planned for randomization with 150 patients in each treatment group. For more details, reference is made to the efficacy section of this assessment report.

## · Population PK analysis

Sparse sampling (2 timepoints: week 6 and 8 of double-blind period) was performed for vortioxetine. In total,  there  were  drawn  564  PK  samples  from  297  patients  on  active  vortioxetine  treatment.  For  2 patients no results were reported. In addition, 44 patients with at least one plasma concentrations &lt;LLOQ were regarded as non-compliant and were removed from the dataset, together with 3 patients where the only PK sample where &lt;LLOQ and the time between last dosing and PK sampling were too long in order to draw any conclusion. Hence, the final dataset for popPK modelling consisted of 248 patients with 467 plasma concentations.

The popPK of vortioxetine was determined using nonlinear mixed effect modelling using NONMEM ® . The first-order conditional error with interaction minimization method was used. The structural popPK model used was the one developed in a previous pooled popPK analysis in healthy adult subjects, which is a two-compartment model with lag-time and with first-order absorption and elimination.

The covariates to be tested were sex, age, weight, height, BMI, LBM, and creatinine clearance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Compliance to vortioxetine treatment on a study level (i.e. population level) was assessed by comparing the distribution of individual CL/F values with the distribution seen in healthy subjects treated under well controlled conditions. CL/F values over 120 L/h were regarded as unrealistic, based on priori knowledge from  controlled  phase  1  studies,  and  patients  with  such  high  CL/F  values  were  regarded  as  noncompliant.

## Results

In Study 12708A ,  the plasma exposure to vortioxetine (in terms of Cmax and AUC) were generally lower in the adolescent cohorts than in the child cohorts (Table 1,Table 2). The exposure for children was similar to that for adults, while adolescents had a generally lower plasma exposure (Table 3). The mean oral clearance for children and adolescents was 42L/h and 62L/h, respectively. One plausible explanation for the higher oral clearance could be non-adherence in the adolescents. However, the formal compliance assessment in this study revealed no obvious sign of non-compliance, neither among the children nor the adolescents.

In Study 12710A , the plasma exposure for adolescents was more similar to that for adults and children. The mean oral clearance for adolescents was 51L/h, which was more similar to that for adults and children (Table 3). The PK data from Study 12710A suggest that 11% and 20% of the patients in the vortioxetine 10 and 20mg groups, respectively, and 14% of the patients in the fluoxetine group, may have been non-compliant.

Simulated values to steady-state and dose-normalized to 10mg a

For Study 12708A , statistically significant (p&lt;0.01) relationships were found between the volume of distribution (VSS/F) and the patients' weight and between the CL/F and the patients' age, whereas no significant covariate-parameter relationships were identified for Study 12710A . In the popPK analysis of healthy adults (between the ages of 18 to 78 years) that was included in the original MAA, body size (in terms of weight, height, and LBM) all significantly affected the volume of distribution for the central compartment (V2/F), whereas age significantly affected CL/F.

## Assessor's comment:

At the time of submission of study 12708A , the rapporteur considered that no changes to the SmPC were necessary. However, it was concluded that PK characteristics should be further investigated with additional data from the upcoming efficacy studies (i.e. study 12709A and 12710A), as planned by the MAH.  With  respect  to  the  popPK  model,  the  methodological  approaches  used  for  data  fitting  and evaluation of fitting performances were supported. However, the Applicant was advised to consider a more integrated approach with  merged adult and pediatric  data. In addition, it  was advised to  use allometric functions (instead of linear functions) to describe the effect of growth-related markers (age and bodyweight) on CL and V.

None of these recommendations were taken into account for the analysis of data from study 12710A . The PopPk model is built only on PK data from this one study, which is limited, some parameters are fixed to adult values and the relationship between some PK parameters and weight is unexpected, it is therefore  not  considered  currently  sufficient  to  describe  the  overall  exposure,  or  for  use  to  inform exposure in PKPD modelling.

When data for the younger children is available, it is recommended that data from all studies be included in an integrated model with the relationship between exposure and age/weight thoroughly explored (see LoQ). The proposed addition of paediatric PK data to section 5.2 is not supported at this stage. Data should be added to section 5.2 once data for the younger children are available (SmPC comment).

## 6.2. PK/PD analyses

## Methods - analysis of data submitted

PopPK/PD analyses were performed for study 12710A. For the PK/PD analyses, one dataset for each PD parameter was created. Patients on placebo were included with a Cav of zero in the PK/PD datasets, while non-compliant patients were excluded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The relationship, if any, after/during 8 weeks of double-blind treatment (Week 12 visit) between the change since baseline in the efficacy parameters CDRS-R, GBI, SDMT and CGAS (treated as continuous variables), denoted ∆ PD, and plasma exposure of vortioxetine (Cav) was investigated through non-linear and linear regression analyses. For the non-linear regression, an Emax model was used on the form

<!-- image -->

where E0 is the intercept, Emax the maximum effect, EC50 the Cav value given 50% of Emax and ε the residual variability. Patients on placebo during the 8 weeks treatment were included in the PK/PD analysis with a Cav of zero, while non-compliant patients were excluded. Patients on fluoxetine were excluded.

The efficacy variables CGI-S and PGA were treated as ordinal categorical variables and the PK/D analysis was modelled through logistic regression using an Emax (on the same form as above) or linear model.

The influence, if any, from patient specific covariates on the parameters in the PK/PD model (e.g. Emax and EC50) was investigated by incorporating the covariates in the regression model in a stepwise forward inclusion and backward deletion manner.

## Results

At Week 8 in the DB Period, there was no apparent relationship between the efficacy variables and plasma exposure to vortioxetine. Post hoc analyses showed significant linear relationships (p&lt;0.05) for CDRS-R and CGAS at Week 4 in the DB Period.

## Assessor's comment:

As stated above, the popPK model is currently not considered sufficient to inform exposure in PKPD modelling.

## 6.3. Clinical efficacy

## Methods - analysis of data submitted

## Study 12708A

Design and doses investigated are outlined in sections 5 and 6.1 of the report. Efficacy assessments were made throughout the entire study. The efficacy assessments comprised the CGI-S and CGI-I. The change from baseline in CGI-S score and the CGI-I (absolute) score were evaluated as secondary endpoints, to assess the state of mental illness and improvement or worsening relative to baseline.

In the main study period, the efficacy analyses were based on the FAS, defined as all patients who took at least one dose of IMP (APTS) and who had a valid baseline assessment and at least one valid post-baseline assessment of the CGI-S score.

In the extension period, the efficacy analyses were based on the EXTS, defined as all patients in the APTS who continued in the optional 6-month extension period. The results were presented using descriptive techniques (OC and LOCF).

Study 12710A was an interventional, prospective, multi-national, multi-site, randomized, placebocontrolled, active-reference (fluoxetine), fixed-dose study in adolescents with MDD. The study had two

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

periods: a 4-week SB Period and an 8-week DB Period. The scheme of overall study design is presented in section 6.1 of the report.

In the SB Period, the patients received treatment with standardized BPI and placebo. The patients and their parents were blinded to treatment. Patients who fulfilled the randomization criteria for incomplete improvement in depressive symptoms at the end of the SB Period (see definition in Study Population below) entered the DB Period; the patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with brief psychological intervention and placebo, vortioxetine 10mg/day, vortioxetine 20 mg/day, or fluoxetine 20mg/day. Patients who did not fulfil the randomization criteria were withdrawn from the study before the start of the DB Period.

The randomized patients followed the following titration schemes:

- vortioxetine 10mg/day: the patients were initiated on 5mg/day (Days 1 and 2) and thereafter they received 10mg/day
- vortioxetine 20mg/day: the patients were initiated on 5mg/day (Days 1 and 2) and then they received 10mg/day (Days 3 and 4), then 15mg/day (Days 5 and 6), and thereafter 20mg/day
- fluoxetine 20mg/day: the patients were initiated on 10mg/day (Days 1 to 6) and thereafter they received 20mg/day

Based on tolerability, the investigator could reduce the dose once at Week 4 of the DB Period. Vortioxetine and fluoxetine could be reduced by 5mg/day and 10mg/day, respectively. No dose increase was allowed; the patients stayed on the reduced dose for the remainder of the study.

To be eligible for enrolment, the patients had to be outpatients with a primary diagnosis of MDD according to DSM-5®2 criteria, and confirmed using the K-SADS-PL. For detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria, please refer to page 9-10 of the summary of clinical efficacy.

The primary and secondary efficacy objectives and endpoints are presented in Panel 3. Efficacy data were collected weekly.

- b Defined as a 250% decrease in CDRS-R total score, caleulated as:

(change from baseline [Randomization]) / (baseline value -- 17)

The efficacy analyses were performed on the FAS, defined as all randomized patients who took at least one dose of double-blind IMP and who had a valid Randomization assessment and at least one valid post-Randomization assessment of the CDRS-R total score.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from Randomization to Week 8 in CDRS-R total score and was analysed using an MMRM approach.

The testing strategy comprised two steps. First, the comparison of Avg. VOR versus placebo was tested at a two-sided 5% significance level. If the result was statistically significant, each vortioxetine dose was tested separately versus placebo at a two-sided 5% significance level.

Statistical significance could be claimed on the individual doses only if significance was claimed for Avg. VOR.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Further details of the statistical methodology and analyses are provided in Study 12710A, chapter 6, Statistical Methodology.

Study 12709A enrols children with MDD and initially had the same study design and the methodology was similar to that for Study 12710A (Panel 1). In July 2019, an interim analysis was conducted to allow termination of the study for futility or efficacy. The result of the interim analysis was to continue the study.

If eligible, patients from Study 12709A are allowed to continue in OLE Study 12712A.

Studies 12712A and 12712B are long-term, OLE studies with vortioxetine in children and adolescents with MDD. Study 12712A is a 6-month extension to Studies 12709A and 12710A, and Study 12712B is an 18-month extension study to Study 12712A.

In both studies, all the patients are treated with vortioxetine (open-label). The overall study design for both studies is presented in Panel 4.

Panel 4 Studies 12712A and 12712B: Study Designs

<!-- image -->

In both studies, the target dose of vortioxetine is 10mg/day, and the dose can be adjusted based on the investigator's clinical judgement to 5, 10, 15, or 20mg/day. In Study 12712A, the dose is initiated at 5mg/day for 2 days. In Study 12712B, the patients continue on the dose they received in Study 12712A (5, 10, 15, or 20mg/day).

The population enrolled in Study 12712A is patients aged 7 to 18 years who have completed treatment in Study 12709A or 12710A. The age limits allow patients who turned 18 years during Study 12710A to continue in Study 12712A. The population enrolled in Study 12712B is patients aged 7 to 17 years who have completed treatment in Study 12712A. The key inclusion criteria are a primary diagnosis of MDD according to DSM-5®2 criteria and that the patients should be indicated for long-term treatment with vortioxetine. The key exclusion criteria that define the study population include:

- The patient has been diagnosed with another psychiatric disorder (for example, mania, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or any psychotic disorder) during Study 12709A or 12710A (Study 12712A)/Study 12712A (Study 12712B).
- The patient has moderate or severe ongoing adverse event(s) related to IMP in Study 12709A or 12710A (Study 12712A)/Study 12712A (Study 12712B) considered a potential safety risk by the investigator.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· The patient is at significant risk of suicide (either in the opinion of the investigator or defined as a 'yes' to suicidal ideation question 4 or 5 or a 'yes' to suicidal behaviour on the C-SSRS within the last 12 months).

As the studies are ongoing, only the results for the CDRS-R and CGI-S as of the cut-off date are presented. The efficacy analyses were performed on the FAS, defined as all patients who took at least one dose of vortioxetine in the respective extension study (Study 12712A or 12712B) and who had at least one valid post-OLEXA (Study 12712A) or post-OLEXB (Study 12712B) assessment of the CDRS-R total score. The absolute scores and the changes from OLEXA (Studies 12712A and 12712B) and OLEXB (Study 12712B) in CDRS-R total score and in CGI-S score and remission based on the CDRS-R and on the CGI-S are presented using descriptive techniques (OC and LOCF).

## Results

## Study 12708A

The main efficacy objective of the study was to provide supportive information for the dose regimen in paediatric efficacy and safety studies with vortioxetine.

The specific objective of the 6-month extension period was to allow for continued vortioxetine treatment for up to 6 months in a study design with predefined safety and efficacy evaluations. Unless otherwise stated, all the data presented in this section are for the extension period.

A total of 41 patients (22 adolescents and 19 children) were treated with vortioxetine during the extension period. A total of 21 patients withdrew during the extension period. The most common primary reasons for withdrawal were administrative or other reasons (4 adolescents and 4 children), adverse events (4 adolescents), and lack of efficacy (2 adolescents and 1 child).

There was a general improvement in the CGI-S scores on Day 182 (OC) relative to baseline in patients who continued in the extension period (Table 6). The mean CGI-S scores were lower on Day 182 than at baseline in all the cohorts, with the mean change from baseline ranging from -1.0 to -3.0 points across cohorts (Panels 8 and 9 and Tables 7 and 8). The CGI-S results based on the LOCF were similar to those based on OC. The change from baseline in CGI-S score between adolescents and children and between dose groups was similar (Tables 9 and 10).

The decreases in CGI-S score were reflected in the proportions of remitters based on the CGI-S (a CGI-S score of 1 or 2): approximately half of the patients were in remission from 10 weeks to the end of the study.

## Assessor's comment:

Drop-out was very high in the extension period. A considerable bias might occur due to the substantial drop out.

## Study 12710A

The objectives of the study were to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of vortioxetine (10 or 20mg/day) after 8 weeks of treatment in adolescents with MDD. A total of 615 patients were treated with IMP during the 8-week DB Period.

The overall withdrawal rate in the DB Period was low (12%) and similar across treatment groups. The most common primary reasons for withdrawal were other (3.9%) and adverse event (3.1%) (Panel

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

11). The proportion of patients who withdrew due to adverse events was lowest in the placebo group (1.3%) and highest in the vortioxetine 20mg group (5.0%).

In the primary efficacy analysis, the mean change from Randomization to Week 8 in CDRS-R total score was -18 points for both placebo and Avg. VOR and the difference (0.2 points in favour of placebo) was not statistically significant (p = 0.9) (Panels 14 and 15 in the summary of clinical efficacy). The testing strategy stopped at this step.

In the analyses of the mean change from Randomization to Week 8 in CDRS-R total score for the individual vortioxetine doses (10 and 20mg/day) versus placebo, the nominal p-value was &gt;0.05 for both doses.

In the fluoxetine group, the mean change from Randomization to Week 8 in CDRS-R total score was 22 points and the difference to placebo was -3.7 points (p = 0.015; Panel 14), thus validating the study's assay sensitivity for efficacy.

The results of the secondary efficacy analyses across the domains of depressive symptoms, cognitive performance, global clinical impression, functionality, and health-related quality of life were consistent with those of the primary efficacy analyses. The results of the secondary efficacy analyses for which the p-value was &lt;0.05 versus placebo in any active treatment group at Week 4 or Week 8 are summarized in Panel 16.

While there were no differences versus placebo for Avg. VOR or the individual vortioxetine doses on any of the depressive symptom subscales or child- or parent-rated scales, there was a nominally statistically significant (p &lt;0.05) improvement on the CGI-S versus placebo at Weeks 1, 3, 4, and 6 in the vortioxetine 20mg group (Panel 16 and Study 12710A, Table 69); the mean difference, which ranged from -0.14 to -0.30 points, is considered clinically relevant.

In each of the treatment groups, the proportions of responders and remitters increased from Week 4 to Week 8 (Panel 17). The proportions were consistently higher in the active treatment groups than in the placebo group, although only remission based on the CDRS-R was nominally (p &lt;0.05) statistically significantly higher in any active treatment group than in the placebo group at Week 4 or Week 8, namely in the fluoxetine group at Week 8.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In summary, in the primary efficacy analysis, the mean change from Randomization to Week 8 in CDRS-R total score was -18 points for both placebo and Avg. VOR and the difference (0.2 points in favour of placebo) was not statistically significant (p = 0.9). The testing strategy stopped at this step. In the analyses of the mean change from Randomization to Week 8 in CDRS-R total score for the individual vortioxetine doses (10 and 20mg/day) versus placebo, the nominal p-value was &gt;0.05 for both doses. In the fluoxetine group, the mean change from Randomization to Week 8 in CDRS-R total score was -22 points and the difference to placebo was -3.7 points with a nominal p-value at 0.015 (&lt;0.05), thus validating the study's assay sensitivity for efficacy. In general, the results of the secondary and exploratory efficacy analyses were consistent with those of the primary efficacy analysis.

## Assessor's comment:

The proposed addition to section 5.1 about study 12710A :

'One randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active-referenced, fixed dose, 8-week study was conducted in adolescent patients with MDD aged 12 to 17 years. The study included a 4-week singleblind placebo lead-in period with standardized psychosocial intervention (N=777); only non-responders from the lead-in period were randomised (N=615). Neither vortioxetine 10 mg/day nor 20 mg/day was statistically significantly superior to placebo based on the Children´s Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) total score. The active reference (fluoxetine 20 mg/day) separated statistically from placebo on the CDRS-R total score.'

is acceptable.

## Ongoing studies Study 12712A and Study 12712B

Interim efficacy data for vortioxetine in the paediatric population are available from the 2 ongoing, long-term, OLE studies: Study 12712A, a 6-month extension study to Studies 12709A and 12710A, and Study 12712B, an 18-month extension study to Study 12712A (Panel 4). The objectives of the studies are to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of flexible doses (5mg/day to 20mg/day) of vortioxetine.

As of 29 September 2019, 523 patients had received vortioxetine in Study 12712A and 94 patients had received vortioxetine in Study 12712B (Panels 18 and 19). Approximately two-thirds of the patients in the OLE studies came from lead-in Study 12710A.

As of the cut-off date, approximately one-fifth of the patients in Study 12712A and one-quarter of the patients in Study 12712B had withdrawn from the studies (Panels 18 and 19). Approximately two-thirds of the patients in Study 12712A and 46% of the patients in Study 12712B had completed the study as of the cut-off date. In Study 12712A, the proportion of adolescents and children who withdrew was similar. The most common primary reasons for withdrawal were adverse events (5.9% of the patients) and other (4.2% of the patients). In Study 12712B, the most common primary reason for withdrawal was other (18% of the patients); the next most common reason for withdrawal was withdrawal of consent (4.3%). Overall, the proportion of withdrawals due to lack of efficacy was low: 1.7% in Study 12712A and 2.1% in Study 12712B (Tables 21 to 23.)

## Secondary Efficacy Analysis Results:

In Study 12712A , the absolute scores and the changes from OLEXA in CDRS-R total score decreased during the 26-week extension period (Panels 22 and 23): at OLEXA, the mean CDRS-R total score was 44 points and it decreased to approximately 30 points at Week 26 (OC and LOCF). The decrease was irrespective of the lead-in study or of the IMP or dose received in lead-in Study 12710A (OC [Tables 30 to 33 and Figures 4 and 5] and LOCF [Tables 34 and 35]).

These decreases in CDRS-R total scores were reflected in the proportions of remitters based on the CDRS-R: 60% (of 316 patients) and 50% of the patients were in remission at Week 26 (OC [Tables 36 and 37] and LOCF [Table 38], respectively).

In Study 12712A, the absolute scores and the changes from OLEXA in CGI-S score also decreased during the 6-month extension period (Panels 24 and 25): at OLEXA, the mean CGI-S score was 3.5 points and it decreased to approximately 2.2 points (OC and LOCF) at Week 26. The decrease was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

irrespective of the lead-in study or of the IMP or dose received in lead-in Study 12710A (OC [Tables 39 to 42 and Figures 6 and 7] and LOCF [Tables 43 and 44]).

These decreases in CGI-S scores were reflected in the proportions of remitters based on the CGI-S: 68% (of 316 patients) and 60% of the patients were in remission at Week 26 (OC [Tables 45 and 46] and LOCF [Table 47], respectively).

In Study 12712B , the absolute scores and the changes both from OLEXB and from OLEXA in CDRS-R total score decreased during the 18-month extension period (OC [Tables 48 to 50 and Figure 8] and LOCF [Tables 51 to 53]): at OLEXB, the mean CDRS-R total score was 34 points and it decreased to 23 points (OC) and 27 points (LOCF) at Week 78.

These decreases in CDRS-R total scores were reflected in the proportions of remitters based on the CDRS-R: 84% (of 44 patients) and 69% of the patients were in remission at Week 78 (OC [Table 54] and LOCF [Table 55], respectively).

In Study 12712B, the absolute scores and the changes both from OLEXB and from OLEXA in CGI-S score also decreased during the 18-month extension period (OC [Tables 56 to 58 and Figure 9] and LOCF [Tables 59 to 61]): at OLEXB, the mean CGI-S score was 2.8 points and it decreased to 1.3 points (OC) and 1.7 points (LOCF) at Week 78.

These decreases in CGI-S scores were reflected in the proportions of remitters based on the CGI-S: 98% (of 43 patients) and 82% of the patients were in remission at Week 78 (OC [Table 62] and LOCF [Table 63], respectively).

## Overall Discussion (MAH)

Comparison of efficacy results across studies: The focus is on the results on the CDRS-R (used in Studies 12710A, 12712A, and 12712B), supplemented with results on the CGI-S (used in all four studies).

CDRS-R:

In Study 12710A, in the primary efficacy analysis, the mean change from Randomization to Week 8 in CDRS-R total score was -18 points for both placebo and Avg. VOR and the difference (0.2 points in favour of placebo) was not statistically significant (p = 0.9) (Panel 14).

Both in Studies 12712A and 12712B, the mean absolute scores and the mean changes from OLEXA and OLEXB (Study 12712B only) in CDRS-R total score decreased during the studies (Panel 23 and Figure 8), although the numbers of patients also decreased. The decreases in CDRS-R total score were reflected in the proportions of remitters based on the CDRS-R. While only 17% of the patients in each vortioxetine group were in remission after 8 weeks in lead-in Study 12710A, 60% of the 316 patients who were in Study 12712A at Week 26 were in remission (OC [Panel 26]), and 84% of the 44 patients who were in Study 12712B at Week 78 were in remission (OC [Panel 26]). Note that this apparent increase in remitters in Study 12712B is based on considerably fewer patients, while that in Study 12712A is based on a fairly stable number of patients for most of the study.

## CGI-S:

In the analysis of the difference to placebo at all visits at which the CGI-S was assessed, the nominal p-value for the difference to placebo was &lt;0.05 at Weeks 1, 3, 4, and 6, in favour of vortioxetine 20mg. The mean difference to placebo in CGI-S score at these weeks ranged from -0.14 to -0.30 points, which was considered clinically relevant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Both in Studies 12712A and 12712B, the mean absolute scores and the mean changes from OLEXA and OLEXB (Study 12712B only) in CGI-S score decreased during the studies (Figures 6 and 9), although the numbers of patients also decreased.

The decreases in CGI-S score were reflected in the proportions of remitters based on the CGI-S. While only 21% and 24% of the patients in the vortioxetine 10mg and 20mg groups, respectively, were in remission after 8 weeks in lead-in Study 12710A, 68% of the 316 patients who were in Study 12712A at Week 26 were in remission (OC [Panel 27]), and 98% of the 43 patients who were in Study 12712B at Week 78 were in remission (OC [Panel 27]). Note that this apparent increase in remitters in Study 12712B is based on considerably fewer patients.

In Study 12708A, the distribution of CGI-S scores shifted during the study: the vast majority of the patients had a baseline CGI-S score of 4.2 (moderately ill) and approximately half of the patients were in remission from 10 weeks to the end of the study. Thus, although Study 12708A enrolled considerably fewer patients than Studies 12710A, 12712A, or 12712B, the improvement on the CGI-S supports the findings in the larger studies.

Analysis of Clinical Information Relevant to Dosing Recommendations:

In completed, short-term Study 12710A in adolescents, the population pharmacokinetic analysis based on 248 patients indicated that steady-state exposure to vortioxetine in adolescents following treatment with 10 or 20mg/day is similar to that in adults. However, the results of the primary efficacy analysis show that Avg. VOR was not statistically significantly different from placebo based on the CDRS-R total score and neither was vortioxetine 10mg or vortioxetine 20mg when analysed separately in the subsequent analysis.

Persistence of Efficacy and/or Tolerance Effects:

As of 29 September 2019, 523 patients and 94 patients had received vortioxetine in ongoing, longterm, OLE Studies 12712A and 12712B, respectively. Although both studies are uncontrolled and therefore no conclusions can be drawn, improvements on both the CDRS-R and CGI-S were observed in the studies and the majority of patients were in remission towards the end of the studies.

## 6.4. Clinical safety

## Methods - analysis of data submitted

## 1.2.1 Safety Data Analysis Sets

All the analyses of safety and tolerability were based on the APTS, which comprised all (randomized) patients who took at least one dose of IMP (vortioxetine, placebo, or active reference [fluoxetine]) (in the DB Period).

## 1.2.2 Doses Investigated

In the completed clinical pharmacology study (Study 12708A ), the patients received once daily doses of vortioxetine 5, 10, 15, or 20mg/day during the main study period. Patients who received vortioxetine 10, 15, or 20mg/day were up-titrated over 2, 4, or 6 days to the assigned dose starting from vortioxetine 5mg/day, with the possibility of reducing the dose for tolerability reasons. Patients who continued in the extension period received flexible doses of vortioxetine (5 to 20 mg/day).

In the completed, short-term study in adolescents (Study 12710A ) and in the 1 ongoing, short-term study in children (Study 12709A ), the patients received fixed doses of vortioxetine 10 or 20mg/day.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the 2 ongoing OLE studies , the patients receive flexible doses of vortioxetine (5 to 20mg/day, with a target dose of 10mg/day).

Description variable by variable and statistical methodology, patient disposition, demographics and baseline characteristics, extent of exposure,  are given in the summary of clinical safety page 9-19.

Suicidal Ideation and Behaviour:

Suicides and suicide attempts are presented in section 2.5.2. of the summary of clinical safety. All the suicide attempts were reported as SAEs.

Suicidal ideation and behaviour were investigated based on TEAEs captured using the SMQ Suicide/Self-injury and are presented in section 2.5.3. of the summary of clinical safety.

To further investigate the potential relationship between vortioxetine and suicidal ideation and behaviour, the C-SSRS2 was used (section 1.2.3.4.1). The C-SSRS is a patient-interview based tool designed to assess suicidal ideation and behaviour in patients in clinical studies. In the clinical studies, two versions of the scale were used, the Baseline Version that explores the patients' suicidal ideation and behaviour prior to the study (lifetime assessment and past 12 months) and the Since Last Visit Version that explores the patients' suicidal ideation and behaviour since the last visit (during study assessment). A version of the C-SSRS specifically developed for use in children was used for children aged 7 to 11 years. The adult version of the C-SSRS was used for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. The results of the C-SSRS are summarized and presented in section 2.5.4. of the summary of clinical safety.

Tolerability as assessed using the PAERS is summarized and listed by severity for completed Studies 12708A and 12710A.

The evaluation of mania is based on completed Study 12710A. The incidence of mania during treatment with vortioxetine was investigated based on TEAEs captured using preferred terms   mania and hypomania, as well as using the GBI Mania subscale.

## Results

## Study 12708A

There were no suicides in Study 12708A.

SAE: 3 patients (all adolescents) had 4 SAEs, all of which occurred during the 6-month extension period. In the vortioxetine 15mg group, 1 patient had suicidal ideation, and in the vortioxedtine 20mg group, 1 patient had intentional overdose and suicide attempt and the other patient had appendicitis. All 4 SAEs were considered not related to IMP by the investigator; all the patients recovered from the events.

Based on the C-SSRS, no suicidal behaviour or preparatory actions towards suicidal behaviour were reported at baseline or during the main study period. A total of 4 patients (1 child and   3 adolescents) reported suicidal ideation (non-specific suicidal thoughts) during the main study period, 3 of whom also reported suicidal ideation at baseline. One additional patient (child) reported non-suicidal, self-injurious behaviour during the main study period, but no suicidal ideation.

In patients who continued in the extension period, 6 patients (all adolescents) had suicidal ideation or behaviour:   · no suicidal ideation or behaviour was reported at baseline   · 5 patients had suicidal ideation (a wish to be dead [2 patients each taking vortioxetine 15 or 20mg] or active suicidal ideation without intent to act [1 patient taking vortioxetine   15mg]);

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1 of these patients (vortioxetine 20mg) reported a wish to be dead also during the   main study period   · 2 patients (vortioxetine 15 or 20mg) had non-suicidal self-injurious behaviour, 1 of whom   (vortioxetine 15mg) had non-suicidal, self-injurious behaviour also during the main study   period   · 1 patient (vortioxetine 20mg) had suicidal behaviour (non-fatal suicide attempt; see   section 2.5.2.3)

AE leading to withdrawal: 4 patients (all adolescents) had an adverse event leading to withdrawal, all of which occurred during the extension period. All adverse events leading to withdrawal were  single events in individual patients. One event (suicide attempt [vortioxetine 20mg]) was an  SAE and considered not related to IMP by the investigator; all the patients either recovered or  were recovering from the event.

TEAE: the proportion of patients who had one or more TEAEs during the main  study period and during the extension period was 77% (37 patients) and 85% (35 patients),  respectively. The TEAEs were severe in 1 patient during the main study period and in  5 patients during the extension period; only the event in the main study period was considered  related to IMP. The TEAEs with an overall incidence ≥ 10% (4 patients) and that were common in both study   periods were headache, nausea, and vomiting; there were no differences between the study   periods in the incidence of these TEAEs. Other TEAEs with an overall incidence ≥ 10% were   sedation, abdominal pain upper, and fatigue in the main study period and dysmenorrhoea in   the extension period.

## Study 12710A

Deaths: Patient S3267, a 15-year-old boy, committed suicide approximately 1 year after completing the study; he had received placebo during the study. For further details, refer to the individual narrative in the CSR.

SAE: 15 patients had SAEs in the DB Period, 7 of which occurred in the  vortioxetine 20mg group (Panel 3). Only suicidal ideation (6 patients) occurred in &gt;1 patient  in any treatment group. All the psychiatric (suicide-related and depression) SAEs were  considered related to IMP.  For details on SAEs in the completed studies, see the individual CSRs.

During the DB Period, 1 patient (vortioxetine 20mg group) had a suicide attempt 35 days after the first dose of IMP; the patient recovered from the event, which was considered related to IMP by the investigator.

Suicidal Ideation and Behaviour Based on the C-SSRS: During the study, the proportions of patients with no suicidal ideation or behaviour were   similar to what was seen at Randomization. One patient in the vortioxetine 20mg group had   suicidal behaviour (non-fatal suicide attempt) and 1 patient in the fluoxetine group had   suicidal ideation (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent).

AE leading to withdrawal: 20 patients had a TEAE leading to withdrawal in the DB Period. Suicidal ideation (6 patients: 1 in the vortioxetine 10mg group, 3 in the vortioxetine 20mg group, and 2  in the fluoxetine group), nausea (3 patients: 1 in the vortioxetine 10mg group and 2 in the  vortioxetine 20mg group), and vomiting (2 patients: both in the vortioxetine 20mg group)  occurred in &gt;1 patient (Panel 5).

TEAE: the incidence of TEAEs in the DB Period was higher in the vortioxetine and   fluoxetine groups than in the placebo group, with the highest incidences in the vortioxetine   20mg group (59% in the vortioxetine 20mg group, 49% in the fluoxetine group, 47% in the   vortioxetine 10mg group, and 41% in the placebo group).   In general, the incidences of TEAEs with an incidence ≥ 5% were higher in the vortioxetine   and fluoxetine groups than in the placebo group, in particular for nausea, headache, and   vomiting (Panel 7 in the summary clin safety). Few adverse events occurred during the Safety Follow-up Period and none   occurred in &gt;1 patient. One suicide occurred approximately 1 year after the end of the Safety   Follow-up Period, but was nevertheless captured as part of the Safety Follow-up Period.

The TEAEs captured using the SMQ Suicide/Self-injury are summarized by preferred term in Panel 9.

In summary, in the DB Period, the incidences of TEAEs, SAEs, and TEAEs leading to withdrawal were higher in the vortioxetine and fluoxetine groups than in the placebo group, with the highest incidences in the vortioxetine 20mg group.

In general, the incidences of the TEAEs with an incidence &gt;5% were higher in the vortioxetine and fluoxetine groups than in the placebo group, in particular for nausea, headache, and vomiting.

The only severe TEAEs that occurred in &gt;1 patient in any treatment group were suicidal ideation (4 patients: 1 in the vortioxetine 10mg group and 3 in the vortioxetine 20mg group) and headache (2 patients: both in the vortioxetine 10mg group)

Two deaths were reported: 1 patient committed suicide in the Screening Period, and 1 patient (from the placebo group) committed suicide approxmiately 1 year after completing the study.

A total of 15 patients had SAEs in the DB Period, 7 of which occurred in the vortioxetine 20mg group. Only suicidal ideation (6 patients) occurred in &gt;1 patient in any treatment group.

Two pregnancies were reported: 1 in the Screening Period and 1 (in the vortioxetine 10mg group) in the DB Period; the outcome of that pregnancy is not known.

In the SB Period, 13 patients had suicide-related TEAEs captured using SMQ Suicide/Self-injury. Suicidal ideation (7 patients), intentional overdose (3 patients), intentional self-injury (3 patients), and suicidal attempt (2 patients) were the suicide-related TEAEs that occurred in &gt;1 patient in the SB Period. For 8 of these patients, at least 1 of the TEAEs was reported as an SAE.

In the DB Period, 14 patients had suicide-related TEAEs as captured using SMQ Suicide/Self-injury; the TEAEs were reported for 2 patients in the vortioxetine 10 mg and 6 patients each in the vortioxetine 20 mg and fluoxetine groups. Suicidal ideation (8 patients: 1 in the vortioxetine 10mg group, 4 in the vortioxetine 20mg group, and 3 in the fluoxetine group) and intentional self-injury (4 patients: 1 in the vortioxetine 10mg group, 2 in the vortioxetine 20mg group, and 1 in the fluoxetine group) were the suicide-related TEAEs that occurred in &gt;1 patient in the DB Period. For 6 of the 14 patients with suicide-related TEAEs, at least 1 of the TEAEs (suicidal ideation [6 patients] and suicide attempt [1 patient]) was reported as an SAE, all of which occurred after more than 14 days of treatment .

In the DB Period, 20 patients had TEAEs leading to withdrawal. Suicidal ideation (6 patients: 1 in the vortioxetine 10mg group, 3 in the vortioxetine 20mg group, and 2 in the fluoxetine group), nausea (3

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients: 1 in the vortioxetine 10mg group and 2 in the vortioxetine 20mg group), and vomiting (2 patients: both in the vortioxetine 20mg group) occurred in &gt;1 patient in the DB Period.

The mean changes from Randomization in all the clinical safety laboratory tests; vital signs; weight, BMI, and height; and ECG parameters were small and comparable between treatment groups and not clinically relevant. Overall, the proportions of patients with post-Randomization PCS values for these variables were low and similar across treatment groups. The shift data indicate that the majority of the post-Randomization PCS laboratory values in &gt;3 patients were already PCS at Randomization.

In the DB Period, the proportions of patients with elevated liver enzymes were low and none of the elevated liver enzymes met the criteria of Hy's law.

On the PAERS, the most common symptoms reported at Randomization were related to MDD (such as items related to depressed mood, irritability, and fatigue) or comorbid psychiatric conditions. The scores for the items related to MDD generally decreased over time and reflected the improvements captured by the efficacy scales in the respective treatment groups. The symptoms showing worsening compared to Randomization reflected the pattern of adverse events reported in this study, such as nausea, vomiting, and hypersomnia.

During the study, based on the C-SSRS, the proportions of patients with no suicidal ideation or behaviour were similar to what was seen at Randomization. Two patients had suicidal behaviour (1 patient in the vortioxetine 20mg group [non-fatal suicide attempt] and 1 patient in the fluoxetine group [active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent]).

Overall, the mean changes from Randomization to Week 8 in GBI Mania subscale score, as assessed by the parent or child, were small as were the differences to placebo (&lt;0.4 points as judged by the parents and &lt;0.6 points as judged by the children) and not clinically relevant. A GBI Mania subscale score &gt;18 points, indicating a potential risk of mania, was reported only sporadically, with no clinically relevant difference across treatment groups. None of the scores &gt;18 points were considered clinically significant by the investigator and none were reported as adverse events

## Assessor's comments:

The proposed addition to section 5.1 about the safety results of study 12710A.

'In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults. Discontinuation due to adverse events (mostly due to nausea and vomiting) was highest in patients treated with vortioxetine 20 mg/day (5.6%) as compared to vortioxetine 10 mg/day (2.7%), fluoxetine (3.3%), and placebo (1.3%). The most commonly reported adverse events in the vortioxetine treatment groups were nausea, vomiting and headache. Suicidal ideation and behaviour were reported as adverse events both during the 4-week single-blind lead-in period (placebo 13/777 [1.7%]), and during the 8-week treatment period (vortioxetine 10 mg/day 2/147 [1.2%], vortioxetine 20 mg/day 6/161 [3.7%], fluoxetine 6/153 [3.9%], placebo 0/154 [0%]). Suicidal ideation and behaviour as measured by Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was similar across treatment groups.'

could be accepted provided that the Applicant clarifies the following points:

The Applicant is asked to provide a comparative analysis supporting this statement: 'In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults.'

Please provide the supporting data for the numerical data: 'Suicidal ideation and behaviour were reported as adverse events both during the 4-week single-blind lead-in period (placebo 13/777 [1.7%]' .  These numerical data were not found in Tables 106-109 of the csr.

Please correct: Suicidal ideation and behaviour were reported as adverse events both during the 4week single-blind lead-in period (placebo 13/777 [1.7%]), and during the 8-week treatment period (vortioxetine 10 mg/day 2/147 [1. 4 %] (instead of 1.2 %).

## Study 12712A

As of 29 September 2019, no suicides had been reported in any of the 3 ongoing studies.

SAE: In OLE Study 12712A, 17 (3.3%) patients had SAEs (Panel 4). The SAEs in &gt;1 patient were suicidal ideation and suicide attempt (5 and 4 patients each) and intentional overdose  (2 patients). The types and incidence of SAEs in children and adolescents were generally  similar.

SAEs in the ongoing studies are summarized in Tables 15 to 18 and listed in Listing 1 (OLE Study 12712A).

A total of 4 patients attempted suicide, all of which occurred in OLE Study 12712A: 1 patient   from ongoing Study 12709A and 3 patients from completed Study 12710A (Table 25).   For the patient from Study 12709A, the suicide attempt occurred 2 days after the first dose of   IMP. For the 3 patients from Study 12710A, the suicide attempt occurred 1, 58, or 91 days   after the first dose of IMP; for 2 patients, the treatment in Study 12710A was fluoxetine and   for the other patient, the treatment in Study 12710A was placebo (Listing 1).   Two of the 4 suicide attempts were considered related to IMP by the investigator, and all the   patients recovered from the event (Listing 1).

AE leading to withdrawal: In OLE Study 12712A, 36 (6.9%) patients had an adverse event leading to withdrawal (Tables  13 and 14). The adverse events leading to withdrawal in ≥ 2 patients were (Panel 6):

- nausea (11 patients)
- suicide attempt (4 patients; see section 2.5.2.4)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- suicidal ideation (4 patients; see section 2.5.3)

· dizziness, intentional overdose (see section 2.5.3), major depression, mania, and vomiting  (2 patients each)

The types and incidences of adverse events leading to withdrawal in children and adolescents  were generally similar.

Adverse events leading to withdrawal in the ongoing studies are summarized in Tables 19 to 22 and listed in Listing 2 (OLE Study 12712A).

TEAEs: In OLE Study 12712A, the types of TEAEs with an incidence ≥ 5% in children and adolescents were generally similar (Panel 8). The incidence of nausea, headache, and dizziness was higher in adolescents than in children.

## Other ongoing studies

SAE: In blinded Study 12709A , 2 (0.6%) patients had 2 SAEs in the DB Period: forearm fracture and major depression.  None of the patients in OLE Study 12712B had SAEs.

AE leading to withdrawal: None of the patients in OLE Study 12712B had an adverse event leading to withdrawal

TEAEs in ongoing, blinded Study 12709A were reviewed periodically by the DMC on unblinded data.

TEAEs in the other 2 ongoing studies are summarized in Tables 23 to 28 for Study 12712A and in Tables 30 to 32 for Study 12712B.

The proportion of patients who had one or more TEAEs was 61% and 50% in Studies 12712A   and 12712B , respectively (Tables 13 and 29).

The TEAEs with an incidence ≥ 5% both in OLE Studies 12712A and 12712B were: nausea   (20 and 7.4%), headache (18 and 14%), vomiting (7.8 and 5.3%), nasopharyngitis (5.9 and   5.3%), and abdominal pain upper (5.0 and 5.3%) (Tables 27 and 32).

## 7. Changes to the Product Information

As a result of this variation, sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 are being updated to reflect the outcomes of Study 12710A and Study 12708A. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly.

## SmPC

4.2: Posology and method of administration

Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Brintellix in children and adolescents aged 7 to 11 less than 18 years have not been established. No data are available (see section 4.4). The efficacy of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years have not been established. Currently available data in adolescent patients are described in section 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made.

## Applicant's proposal 2 nd  round:

The safety and efficacy of Brintellix in children and adolescents aged 7 to 11 less than 18 years have not been established.

Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Applicant's proposal 3 rd  round:

Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1). The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years is described in section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1.

## 4.4: Special warnings and precautions for use

## Use in paediatric population

Brintellix is not recommended for the treatment of depression in patients aged less than 18 years since the safety and/or efficacy of vortioxetine have not been established in this age group (see section 4.2).

In  clinical  studies  in  children  and  adolescents  treated  with  other  antidepressants,  suicide-related behaviour (suicide attempt and suicidal thoughts) and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour, anger) were more frequently observed than in those treated with placebo.

Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1). In general , the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents  was  similar  to  that  seen  for  adults  except  for  higher  incidences  reported  in adolescents than in adults for abdominal pain-related events and suicidal ideation. In clinical studies  in  children  and  adolescents  treated  with  antidepressants,  suicide-related  behaviour  (suicide attempt and suicidal thoughts) and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour, anger) were more frequently observed than in those treated with placebo.

## 4.8: Undesirable effects

## Paediatric population

A total of 308 adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) were treated with vortioxetine in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults. For further details see section 5.1.

## 5.1: Pharmacodynamic properties

## Paediatric population

One  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  active-referenced,  fixed  dose,  8-week  study  was conducted in adolescent patients with MDD aged 12 to 17 years. The study included a 4-week singleblind placebo lead-in period with standardized psychosocial intervention (N=777); only non-responders from the lead-in period were randomised (N=615). Neither vortioxetine 10 mg/day nor 20 mg/day was statistically significantly superior to placebo based on the Children´s Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) total score. The active reference (fluoxetine 20 mg/day) separated statistically from placebo on the CDRS-R total score. In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar  to  that  seen  for  adults.  Discontinuation  due  to  adverse  events  (mostly  due  to  nausea  and vomiting)  was  highest  in  patients  treated  with  vortioxetine  20  mg/day  (5.6%)  as  compared  to vortioxetine 10 mg/day (2.7%), fluoxetine (3.3%), and placebo (1.3%). The most commonly reported adverse events in the vortioxetine treatment groups were nausea, vomiting and headache. Suicidal ideation and behaviour were reported as adverse events both during the 4-week single-blind lead-in period (placebo 13/777 [1.7%]), and during the 8-week treatment period (vortioxetine 10 mg/day 2/147 [1.2%], vortioxetine 20 mg/day 6/161 [3.7%], fluoxetine 6/153 [3.9%], placebo 0/154 [0%]). Suicidal ideation and behaviour as measured by Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was similar across treatment groups.

Suicidal ideation and behaviour as measured by Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was similar across treatment groups.

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies in major depressive disorder with vortioxetine in children aged less than 7 years (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies in major depressive disorder with vortioxetine in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of major depressive disorder children and adolescents aged 7 to 18 years (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Applicant's proposal 3 rd  round:

The proposed wording is accepted.

## 5.2: Pharmacokinetic properties

## Paediatric population

Pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine in paediatric patients with major depressive disorder following oral administration of 5 to 20 mg once daily was characterized using population modeling analyses based on data from a pharmacokinetic study (7-17 years) and an efficacy and safety study (11-17 years). The pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine in paediatric patients were similar to that observed in adult patients.

## PIL:

## 2. What you need to know before you take Brintellix Children and adolescents

Brintellix is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years due to lack of information for this age group.

## Applicant's proposal 3 rd  round:

Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated. In general, the side effects of vortioxetine for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years was similar to that seen for adults except for more frequent side effects of abdominal pain and suicidal ideation.

## Member's comments

## Co-Rapporteur's comments :

The Rapporteur's concerns in the AR for this type II variation (II/025) are supported. With respect to the Rapporteur's comment for section 4.2, we consider it more appropriate to be modified to the following:

Brintellixshouldnotbeusedinadolescentsaged12to17yearswithmajordepressivedisorder(MDD)becauseof efficacy concerns has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1). in a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, active-referenced,fixed dose, 8 weekstudvin dolescent patients DDaged12to17years, vortioxetinewas notstatistica sien superior to placebo based on the Children's Depression Rating Scale Revised (CDRs R) tota for safety data

The description of the study should be not included in section 4.2, according to the SPC Guideline.

## Rapporteur Response:

We Agree with the Co- Rapporteur's comments . Question 2 and the SPC comments have been updated accordingly.

## Comments MS1

MS 1endorse the conclusions of the rapporteur but would like to consider an alternative wording for section 4.2

Paediatricpopulation

The safety and efficacy ofBrintellix in children aged 7 to 11y yearshavenotbeenestablished.Nodata are available. Brintellix should not be used in adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years) because efficacy has not been demonstrated in clinical trials (seesection 5.1).

## Rapporteur Response:

We Agree with MS comments .  Question 2 and the SPC comments have been updated accordingly, except for 'in clinical trials'.

## Comments MS2

We endorse the Rapporteur's AR, however we have further comments on section 4.2 of the SmPC - see below in the appropriate section.

For section 4.2, we suggest the following:

ThesafetyandefficacyofBrintellixinchildrenand scentsaqed7to11less than 18 yearshavenotbeen established.Nodataareavailable(seesection4.4).

Brintellixshouldnotbeusedinadolescentsaqed12to17yearswithmaiordepressivedisorder(MDD)because ofefficacyandsafetyconcerns(seesection5.1andsection4.8forsafetydata).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rapporteur Response:

The statement regarding the safety profile in adolescents in sections 4.8 and 5.1 needs to be justified by the Applicant with supporting data: A comparative analysis of the adverse reaction profile in adolescents compared to adults is asked (see question 4).

If specific paediatric safety concerns would emerge from that analysis, or from the ongoing safety studies, the concerns based on which Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) might need to be extended to safety as well.

At this point in time, the wording for section 4.2 has been updated according to other comments received.

## Comments 3

We concur with the Rapporteur's proposal for the wording of sections 4.2., 4.4 and 5.1, and with the request for a comparative analysis of adult and paediatric adverse reactions to justify the proposed text in section 4.8.

## Rapporteur Response:

The wording for section 4.2 has been updated according to other comments received.

## Other comments

The PopPk model is built only on PK data from this one study (i.e. 12710A), which is limited, some parameters are fixed to adult values and the relationship between some PK parameters and weight is unexpected, it is therefore not considered currently sufficient to describe the overall exposure, or for use to  inform  exposure  in  PKPD  modelling.    When  data  for  the  younger  children  is  available,  it  is recommended that data from all studies be included in an integrated model with the relationship between exposure and age/weight thoroughly explored.

Given that there is no indication for use in the paediatric population at present, we suggest not to include paediatric PK data in section 5.2 of the SmPC at this stage, but to request data in line with above comments which can be added to section 5.2. once data for the younger children are available.

## Response

Comments are agreed. The report has been updated accordingly.

The MAH should justify why no integrated popPK model was built with data from all studies included and with the relationship between exposure and age/weight thoroughly explored, in line with previous recommendations.

Paediatric data should be added to section 5.2 only once this integrated popPK analysis has been performed. (see SmPC comment)

## SmPC

## Question 2

## Section 4.2:

The following wording is considered more appropriate:

The safety and efficacy of Brintellix in children and adolescents aged 7 to 11 less than 18 years have not been established. No data are available (see section 4.4).

Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because of efficacy concerns: in a  randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active-referenced, fixed dose, 8-week study in adolescent patients with MDD aged 12 to 17 years, vortioxetine was not statistically significantly superior to placebo based on the Children´s Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) total score (see section 5.1 and section 4.8 for safety data).

Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1).

'In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults.' is not fully agreed with. The Applicant is asked to provide a comparative analysis supporting this statement.

## Question 5:

## Section 5.1:

'In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults.' is not fully agreed with. The Applicant is asked to provide a comparative analysis supporting this statement.

Please write in line with the data presented in Panel 5 of the summary of clinical safety:

'Discontinuation due to adverse events (mostly due to suicidal ideation , nausea and vomiting) …

Please provide the supporting data for the numerical data: 'Suicidal ideation and behaviour were reported as adverse events both during the 4-week single-blind lead-in period (placebo 13/777 [1.7%]' .  These numerical data were not found in Tables 106-109 of the csr.

Please correct: Suicidal ideation and behaviour were reported as adverse events both during the 4week single-blind lead-in period (placebo 13/777 [1.7%]), and during the 8-week treatment period (vortioxetine 10 mg/day 2/147 [1. 4 %] (instead of 1.2 %).

## Question 6:

## Section 5.2:

Given that there is no indication for use in the paediatric population at present and considering the limitations of the provided popPK model, paediatric PK data should not be included at this stage.

## Question 1

The MAH should justify why no integrated popPK model was built with data from all studies included and with  the  relationship  between  exposure  and  age/weight  thoroughly  explored,  in  line  with  previous recommendations.

Paediatric  data  should  be  added  to  section  5.2  only  once  this  integrated  popPK  analysis  has  been performed. (see SmPC comment)

## Summary of the MAH's response

A popPK analysis for vortioxetine based on merged adult and paediatric data has now been performed with special focus on investigating the effect of growth-related markers (age and body size) on oral clearance and apparent volume of distribution. The merged dataset consists of 887 adult healthy subjects with rich PK sampling, 24 children and 24 adolescents from Study 12708A with semi-rich PK sampling and 248 adolescents from Study 12710A with sparse PK sampling.

The structural PK model used was the one developed in the pooled popPK analysis in healthy subjects, which is a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination.

Compliance to vortioxetine treatment was judged by comparing the distribution of individual CL/F values with the distribution seen in healthy subjects treated under well controlled conditions. CL/F values over 120  L/h  were  regarded  as  unrealistic,  based  on  prior  knowledge  from  controlled  phase  1  studies. Nineteen (19) patients with such high CL/F values were regarded as non-compliant and excluded from the dataset and further analysis.

The impact of age (both in years and as group [children,adolescent and adult]) and body size measures (weight, height and BMI [body mass index]) on oral clearance (CL/F) and volumes of distributions (V2/F and  V3/F)  were  investigated.  Both  allometric  and  linear  (median  centred)  functions  were  used  to investigate  the  relationships,  if  any.  In  general,  the  linear  covariate-parameter  functions  performed better than the allometric (power) functions, although the differences weren't very pronounced. Age and height on CL/F and weight on V3/F (using a linear function) were included in the model.

The standard errors of the estimated parameters (thetas, etas, epsilon) were all below 25% and the goodness-of-fit plots revealed a stable and reliable model. A visual predictive check (vpc) plot showed good predictability of the model.

Based on the final popPK model, simulations of Cmax and AUC0-24h at steady-state for a dose of 10 mg were  performed  for  four  different  age  groups:  children,  adolescent,  young  adult  and  elderly.  The characteristics of the age groups are summarized in Panel 2.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The final PopPK model for the integrated analysis of adult and pediatric PK data has the same model structure  utilized  for  the  PK  characterization  of  vortioxetine  in  healthy  adult  subjects.  Based  on simulations  performed  using  the  final  model,  the  Applicant  concludes  similar  plasma  exposure  in paediatric and adult subjects. However, the following issues were identified in the model building and evaluation as performed by the Applicant:

1. Data exclusion: 19 patients were excluded from the analysis based on high estimated clearance (&gt;120l/h) using a very preliminary model: this is not acceptable in principle. This could be very problematic if all these patients (19) are children (only 24 in total in the analysis dataset).
2. Final model predictive performances should be shown on different age groups (at least children vs adolescents vs adults healthy vs adult patients)
3. Patients characteristics and their correlations to be used in simulations should be taken from the actual values in all the observed patient data (including the ones excluded from the popPK analysis). The fact that healthy volunteers data were used for adults and elderly is not acceptable. The fact that correlation were taken from POPPK dataset is not endorsed either.
4. Results of graphical and numerical evaluation of correlation between candidate covariate outside the modelling process should be displayed separately in children, adolescents and adults (healthy and patients).
5. p-values thresholds for covariate inclusion in the model are quite low (0.005 for backward exclusion).

## Question 2

## Section 4.2:

The following wording is considered more appropriate:

The safety and efficacy of Brintellix in children and adolescents aged 7 to 11 less than 18 years have not been established. No data are available (see section 4.4).

Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because of efficacy concerns: in a  randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active-referenced, fixed dose, 8-week study in adolescent patients with MDD aged 12 to 17 years, vortioxetine was not statistically significantly superior to placebo based on the Children´s Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) total score (see section 5.1 and section 4.8 for safety data).

Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1).

## Summary of the MAH's response

The Applicant accepts the proposed wording for section 4.2.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

Based on the comparative analysis provided by the Applicant of TEAEs from the completed study 12710A compared with TEAEs in adult patients from the MDD placebo-controlled short-term pool (completed studies only) it is requested to adapt the wording in section 4.2 to:

Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1). The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years has not been established (see section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1).

## Conclusion

Issue not resolved

## Question 3

## Section 4.4:

Please delete '/or,' since the statement remains valid for both efficacy and safety.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The Applicant proposes the following alternative wording for section 4.4 in order to capture the available safety data for adolescents (new text in bold; deleted text in strike-through):

Brintellix is not recommended for the treatment of depression in patients aged less than 18 years since the safety and efficacy of vortioxetine have not been established in children aged 7 to 11 years and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

since the efficacy of vortioxetine has not been demonstrated in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years this age group (see section 4.2).

In clinical studies in children and adolescents treated with other antidepressants, suicide-related behaviour (suicide attempt and suicidal thoughts) and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour, anger) were more frequently observed than in those treated with placebo.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The proposed wording is partially accepted: a stronger wording than 'not recommended' is needed for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, and regarding safety, given that

- Higher incidences have been reported in adolescents than in adults, for suicidal ideation.
- In the DB Period of Study 12710A, higher incidences of suicide-related TEAEs were reported in the vortioxetine 20 mg and fluoxetine groups (3.7 and 3.9%, respectively) than in the placebo group (none).
- Studies 12712A and 12712B are still ongoing. Only limited safety data in adolescents are available.
- 4 patients attempted suicide in OLE Study 12712A, Two of which were considered related to IMP by the investigator.

Please add: The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years has not been established. Only limited data are available (see section 4.8 and 5.1).

## As follows:

Brintellix is not recommended for the treatment of depression in patients aged less than 18 years since the safety and efficacy of vortioxetine have not been established in children aged 7 to 11 years. Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1). The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years has not been established. Only limited data are available (see section 4.8 and 5.1).

In addition , in the next sentence of the paragraph 'use in paediatric population' of section 4.4, the existing statement regarding clinical studies in adolescents  should be adapted to be coherent with the safety information for the paediatric population that is the subject of the present variation procedure. In this respect, 'other' should be deleted, at least for suicide-related behaviour.

Conclusion

Issue not resolved.

Question 4

Section 4.8:

'In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults.' is not fully agreed with. The Applicant is asked to provide a comparative analysis supporting this statement.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Summary of the MAH's response

When comparing TEAEs in adult patients from the MDD placebo-controlled short-term pool (completed studies only) with TEAEs in adolescent patients from the completed Study 12710A, the general picture is the same.

Table 1 and Table 2 show the distribution of the TEAEs over the different System Organ Classes (SOCs) for the adult and the adolescent populations, respectively. The distribution is similar when comparing the adult and the adolescent data. For both adult and adolescent data, TEAEs were most commonly (&gt;10% for Total vortioxetine) reported within the SOCs Gastrointestinal Disorders, Nervous System Disorders, and Infections and Infestations. For both adult and adolescent data, this was followed by the SOCs Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders, Psychiatric Disorders, and General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions.

Table 3 and Table 4 show the TEAEs by Preferred Term (PT) for the adult and the adolescent populations, respectively. For both adult and adolescent data, the most commonly reported PTs for the Total vortioxetine group include nausea, headache, nasopharyngitis, dizziness and diarrhoea. The PTs nausea and headache were the only PTs reported with an incidence of more than 10% in the Total vortioxetine group for both the adult and adolescent data. Vomiting was reported at a higher incidence in the adolescent population, but the total incidence of nausea and vomiting was similar in the adult and adolescent populations. The remaining commonly reported TEAEs in the Total vortioxetine group were also reported with similar incidence in the adult and adolescent populations.

Higher incidences were reported in adolescents for abdominal pain-related events and suicidal ideation than in adults.

The incidences of abdominal pain-related events (PTs abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper and abdominal discomfort) were higher in the Total vortioxetine group in adolescents than in adults (Table 3 and Table 4). It should be noted that abdominal pain is common in the paediatric population. This is reflected in the incidences of abdominal pain-related events in adolescents in the placebo group or the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

placebo lead-in period. The incidence of the PT abdominal discomfort was higher in the Total vortioxetine group (2.3%) than in the placebo group (0.6%) or the placebo lead-in period (0.1%; Study 12710, Table 102) in adolescents.

However, for the PTs abdominal pain (Total vortioxetine 1.9%; placebo 2.6%; placebo lead-in period 2.1%) and abdominal pain upper (Total vortioxetine 3.2%; placebo 0.6%; placebo lead-in period 2.6%), similar incidences were reported in the placebo group and in the placebo lead-in period.

Suicidal ideation was reported at a higher incidence in the Total vortioxetine group in adolescents than in adults (Table 3 and Table 4). The reporting of suicide-related events is considered in line with the underlying disease of Major Depressive Disorder. It should furthermore be noted that data from the CSSRS in Study 12710A showed similar rates across all treatment groups. In general, it is therefore concluded that the totality of data for the adolescent population does not show a difference between vortioxetine and placebo for the suicide-related events.

As stated in Module 2.7.4, the Adverse Events of Special Interest in the adolescent population did not show any different safety concerns from that in the adult population.

As the adolescent data are only based on Study 12710A, small differences in the absolute numbers of TEAEs have a greater impact on the TEAE incidences.

In conclusion, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that in adults. The most commonly reported SOCs and TEAEs, and incidences at which they were reported, are in general similar in the adult and adolescent populations. Where differences are seen, these do not indicate a significant different risk profile for the two populations.

The Applicant's proposed wording for section 4.8 was not changed:

## Paediatric population

A total of 308 adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) were treated with vortioxetine in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults. For further details see section 5.1.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The Applicant did not include the safety results obtained in study 12708A , in children and adolescents, nor the safety interim data from ongoing studies 12712A and 12712B in children and adolescents, in the in the comparative analysis of the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents versus adults.

Since the adolescent data in the comparative analysis are only based on Study 12710A, and numbers are small, it is recommended to further refine the analysis when more data become available.

However, based on the comparative data provided, it cannot be agreed with, that the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults.

Based on the comparative data provided the following amendment is asked:

In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults except for higher incidences reported in adolescents than in adults for abdominal pain-related events and suicidal ideation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Conclusion

## Issue not resolved.

## Question 5

## Section 5.1:

1)'In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults.' is not fully agreed with. The Applicant is asked to provide a comparative analysis supporting this statement.

2)Please write in line with the data presented in Panel 5 of the summary of clinical safety:

'Discontinuation due to adverse events (mostly due to suicidal ideation , nausea and vomiting) …

3)Please provide the supporting data for the numerical data: 'Suicidal ideation and behaviour were reported as adverse events both during the 4-week single-blind lead-in period (placebo 13/777 [1.7%]' .  These numerical data were not found in Tables 106-109 of the csr.

4)Please correct: Suicidal ideation and behaviour were reported as adverse events both during the 4week single-blind lead-in period (placebo 13/777 [1.7%]), and during the 8-week treatment period (vortioxetine 10 mg/day 2/147 [1. 4 %] (instead of 1.2 %).

## Summary of the MAH's response

1. Please see the Applicant's response to Question 4 for the comparative analysis.
2. The Applicant accepts the proposed wording.
3. Adverse events of 'suicidal ideation and behaviour' cover all events captured by the SMQ Suicide/self-injury. The data for these suicide-related events reported during the 4-week single-blind lead-in period are in Table 125, and the corresponding data for the double-blind period are in Table 126 of the CSR.
4. The Applicant accepts the proposed wording.

The amended proposed wording by the Applicant:

One  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  active-referenced,  fixed  dose,  8-week  study  was conducted in adolescent patients with MDD aged 12 to 17 years. The study included a 4-week singleblind placebo lead-in period with standardized psychosocial intervention (N=777); only non-responders from the lead-in period were randomised (N=615). Neither vortioxetine 10 mg/day nor 20 mg/day was statistically significantly superior to placebo based on the Children´s Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) total score. The active reference (fluoxetine 20 mg/day) separated statistically from placebo on the CDRS-R total score. In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults. Discontinuation due to adverse events (mostly due to suicidal ideation, nausea and vomiting) was highest in patients treated with vortioxetine 20 mg/day (5.6%) as compared to vortioxetine 10 mg/day (2.7%), fluoxetine (3.3%), and placebo (1.3%). The most commonly reported adverse events in the vortioxetine treatment groups were nausea, vomiting and headache. Suicidal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ideation and behaviour were reported as adverse events both during the 4-week single-blind lead-in period (placebo 13/777 [1.7%]), and during the 8-week treatment period (vortioxetine 10 mg/day 2/147 [1.4%] , vortioxetine 20 mg/day 6/161 [3.7%], fluoxetine 6/153 [3.9%], placebo 0/154 [0%]). Suicidal ideation and behaviour as measured by Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was similar across treatment groups.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

1. Please write instead of 'In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults.':

In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults except for higher incidences reported in adolescent than in adults for abdominal pain-related events and suicidal ideation.

## Conclusion

## Issue partially resolved.

## Question 6

## Section 5.2:

Given that there is no indication for use in the paediatric population at present and considering the limitations of the provided popPK model, paediatric PK data should not be included at this stage.

## Summary of the MAH's response

With the popPK model provided in response to Question 1, the Applicant proposes to include the originally proposed wording in section 5.2:

## Paediatric population

Pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine in paediatric patients with major depressive disorder following oral administration of 5 to 20 mg once daily was characterized using population modeling analyses based on data from a pharmacokinetic study (7-17 years) and an efficacy and safety study (11-17 years). The pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine in paediatric patients was similar to that observed in adult patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The acceptance of the proposed wording is pending the final evaluation of the popPK analysis (see question 1)

Conclusion

Issue not resolved

PIL

Question 7

Section 2

Please adapt the wording in line with the comments given for the SPC.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The Applicant has updated the PIL, section 2, accordingly.

Proposed wording:

## Children and adolescents

Brintellix is not recommended in children aged 7 to 11 years due to lack of information. Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years as efficacy has not been demonstrated.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

## Rapporteur's comment:

Please write:

Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated .

The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years has not been established.

## Other concerns

Question 1

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Applicant performed a popPK analysis for vortioxetine based on merged adult and paediatric data. However, the following issues were identified in the model building and evaluation as performed by the Applicant:

- Data exclusion: 19 patients were excluded from the analysis based on high estimated clearance (&gt;120l/h) using a very preliminary model: this is not acceptable in principle. This could be very problematic if all these patients (19) are children (only 24 in total in the analysis dataset).
- Final model predictive performances should be shown on different age groups (at least children vs adolescents vs adults healthy vs adult patients)
- Patients characteristics and their correlations to be used in simulations should be taken from the actual values in all the observed patient data (including the ones excluded from the popPK analysis). The fact that healthy volunteers data were used for adults and elderly is not acceptable. The fact that correlation were taken from POPPK dataset is not endorsed either.
- Results of graphical and numerical evaluation of correlation between candidate covariate outside the modelling process should be displayed separately in children, adolescents and adults (healthy and patients).
- p-values thresholds for covariate inclusion in the model are quite low (0.005 for backward exclusion).

The acceptance of the proposed wording regarding paediatric PK data in section 5.2 of the SmPC is pending the responses to the questions above.

## Question 2

## SPC section 4.2:

Based on the comparative analysis provided by the Applicant of TEAEs from the completed study 12710A compared with TEAEs in adult patients from the MDD placebo-controlled short-term pool (completed studies only) it is requested to adapt the wording in section 4.2 to:

Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1). The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years has not been established (see section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1).

## Question 3

## SPC section 4.4:

- 1) a stronger wording than 'not recommended' is needed for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, and regarding safety, given that
2. -Higher incidences have been reported in adolescents than in adults, for suicidal ideation.
3. -In the DB Period of Study 12710A, higher incidences of suicide-related TEAEs were reported in the vortioxetine 20 mg and fluoxetine groups (3.7 and 3.9%, respectively) than in the placebo group (none).
4. -Studies 12712A and 12712B are still ongoing. Only limited safety data in adolescents are available.
5. -4 patients attempted suicide in OLE Study 12712A, Two of which were considered related to IMP by the investigator.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Please add : The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years has not been established. Only limited data are available (see section 4.8 and 5.1).

## As follows:

Brintellix is not recommended for the treatment of depression in patients aged less than 18 years since the safety and efficacy of vortioxetine have not been established in children aged 7 to 11 years. Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1). The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years has not been established. Only limited data are available (see section 4.8 and 5.1).

- 2) In addition , in the next sentence of the paragraph 'use in paediatric population' of section 4.4, the existing statement regarding clinical studies in adolescents  should be adapted to be coherent with the safety information for the paediatric population that is the subject of the present variation procedure. In this respect, 'other' should be deleted, at least for suiciderelated behaviour.

## MS comments

We suggest a slight amendment to the text proposed by the Rapporteur for section 4.4:

Text proposed by Rapporteur:

Brintellix is not recommended for the treatment of depression in patients aged less than 18 years since the safety and efficacy of vortioxetine have not been established in children aged 7 to 11 years. Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1). The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years has not been established. Only limited data are available (see section 4.8 and 5.1).

Proposed rewording:

Brintellix is not recommended for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in the paediatric population. The safety and efficacy of Brintellix in children aged 7 to 11 years have not been established.  Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1). The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years has not been established. Only limited data are available (see section 4.8 and 5.1).

Rapporteurs comments : Following the comment received from MS, we propose to adapt the wording to : Brintellix is not recommended for the treatment of depression in patients aged less than 18 years in the paediatric population since the safety and efficacy of vortioxetine have not been established in children aged 7 to 11 years. Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1). The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17

years has not been established. Only limited data are available (see section 4.8 and 5.1).

## Question 4 SPC section 4.8:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Applicant did not include the safety results obtained in study 12708A , in children and adolescents, nor the safety interim data from ongoing studies 12712A and 12712B in children and adolescents, in the in the comparative analysis of the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents versus adults.

Since the adolescent data in the comparative analysis are only based on Study 12710A, and numbers are small, it is recommended to further refine the analysis when more data become available.

However, based on the comparative data provided, it cannot be agreed with, that the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults.

Based on the comparative data provided the following amendment is asked:

In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults except for higher incidences reported in adolescents than in adults for abdominal pain-related events and suicidal ideation.

## Question 5

## SPC section 5.1:

Please write instead of 'In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults.':

## Comments

The rapporteur's additional questions on question 1 in terms of further evaluation of the PopPK model are agreed.  Ideally a report should be submitted as per the EMA guideline: Reporting the results of population  Pharmacokinetic  analysis  (CHMP/EWP/185990/06)  and  with  reference  to  the  paediatric Modelling and Simulation Questions and Answers.  It is considered particularly important to further justify the selection of covariates for weight and age.  Given the indication, the focus should be on allowing the best fit to the paediatric data, rather than an overall fit to the data; the plots in appendix II do not suggest that a linear function will always be adequate.  Age and height were selected as the covariates for  clearance,  rather  than  the  well  supported  relationship  for  weight  proposed  in  the  questions  and answers, this should be justified, or simulations provided with both scenarios.  In addition, it is suggested that covariance between age and height would be expected in children and should be included in the model.

## Rapporteurs comments :

## Summary of the MAH's response

A report giving the results of the popPK analyses and simulations has been written and is submitted. Answers on the specific issues were given and are also incorporated in the report where relevant

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The applicant has satisfactorily answered the questions. The modelling report was updated as requested and all the relevant information provided.

The model fit the data acceptably well even though the variability seems to be overestimated in children, adolescents and adults. The average levels were acceptably well predicted by the model.

## Conclusion

Issue closed.

## Question 2

## SPC section 4.2:

Based on the comparative analysis provided by the Applicant of TEAEs from the completed study 12710A compared with TEAEs in adult patients from the MDD placebo-controlled short-term pool (completed studies only) it is requested to adapt the wording in section 4.2 to:

Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1). The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years has not been established (see section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1).

## Summary of the MAH's response

In addition to the previously provided TEAEs from the completed Study 12710A, the Applicant hereby also provides TEAEs from adolescent patients from completed Study 12708A (see Appendix I for the main period and Appendix II for the extension period), and TEAEs from adolescent patients from the ongoing Study 12712A (see Appendix III) and Study 12712B (see Appendix IV). It should be noted that all adolescent patients have been withdrawn from Study 12712A and Study 12712B based on a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee, and the last scheduled visit for an adolescent patient was on 30-Jan- 2020. Hence, although Study 12712A and Study 12712B are still ongoing, the information on TEAEs from the adolescent patients from these studies are complete. Study 12712B has had last patient last visit on 16-Apr-2020 and is currently in reporting. The distribution of TEAEs over the different System Organ Classes (SOCs) and the incidence of the commonly reported TEAEs are considered similar for adolescents for Studies 12708A, 12710A, 12712A and 12712B. Hyperprolactinaemia is reported with a higher incidence in Study 12712B. Prolactin is part of the clinical safety laboratory tests measured in Studies 12712A and 12712B, but prolactin was not included in the clinical safety laboratory tests measured in Study 12710A, nor in the adult MDD studies. Thus, Lundbeck is currently in the process of performing a signal assessment for vortioxetine and hyperprolactinaemia, which is not specific for the adolescent population, but for vortioxetine in general. Lundbeck will complete the signal assessment and propose relevant actions in the upcoming PSUR no. 10 (data lock point: 29-Sep-2020), as appropriate based on the assessment. Based on the safety data from all adolescent patients, and as no further adolescents will complete or be included in the vortioxetine paediatric studies, the safety of Brintellix in this population is considered established. The Applicant therefore proposes to refer to section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1, as follows:

Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1). The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years is described in section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The Applicant mentions t that all adolescent patients have been withdrawn from Study 12712A and Study 12712B based on a recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee. Clarification is asked what has been the reason for this recommendation and if it was safety driven.

The Rapporteur does not consider the safety in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years as 'established' for the reason given by the Applicant, namely that all data available have been provided/reported. Data remain sparse and there are safety concerns (section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1.).

Nevertheless, the wording proposed by the Applicant is acceptable.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved.

But the Applicant is asked to clarify if the recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee to withdraw all adolescent patients from studies 12712A and 12712B was safety driven?

## Question 3

## SPC section 4.4:

- 1) a stronger wording than 'not recommended' is needed for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, and regarding safety, given that
2. -Higher incidences have been reported in adolescents than in adults, for suicidal ideation.
3. -In the DB Period of Study 12710A, higher incidences of suicide-related TEAEs were reported in the vortioxetine 20 mg and fluoxetine groups (3.7 and 3.9%, respectively) than in the placebo group (none).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Studies 12712A and 12712B are still ongoing. Only limited safety data in adolescents are available.
- -4 patients attempted suicide in OLE Study 12712A, Two of which were considered related to IMP by the investigator.

Please add : The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years has not been established. Only limited data are available (see section 4.8 and 5.1).

## As follows:

Brintellix is not recommended for the treatment of depression in patients aged less than 18 years since the safety and efficacy of vortioxetine have not been established in children aged 7 to 11 years. Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1). The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years has not been established. Only limited data are available (see section 4.8 and 5.1).

- 2) In addition , in the next sentence of the paragraph 'use in paediatric population' of section 4.4, the existing statement regarding clinical studies in adolescents  should be adapted to be coherent with the safety information for the paediatric population that is the subject of the present variation procedure. In this respect, 'other' should be deleted, at least for suiciderelated behaviour.

## MS comments

We suggest a slight amendment to the text proposed by the Rapporteur for section 4.4:

Text proposed by Rapporteur:

Brintellix is not recommended for the treatment of depression in patients aged less than 18 years since the safety and efficacy of vortioxetine have not been established in children aged 7 to 11 years. Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1). The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years has not been established. Only limited data are available (see section 4.8 and 5.1).

Proposed rewording:

Brintellix is not recommended for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in the paediatric population. The safety and efficacy of Brintellix in children aged 7 to 11 years have not been established.  Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1). The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years has not been established. Only limited data are available (see section 4.8 and 5.1).

Rapporteur's comments :

Following the comment received from MS, we propose to adapt the wording to :

Brintellix is not recommended for the treatment of depression in patients aged less than 18 years in the paediatric population since the safety and efficacy of vortioxetine have not been established in children aged 7 to 11 years. Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1). The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years has not been established. Only limited data are available (see section 4.8 and 5.1).

## Summary of the MAH's response

The safety profile in adolescents is considered established as all available data are included in this variation; reference is also made to the response to Question 2. Based on the available data from adolescent patients, the Applicant proposes the following wording for section 4.4:

Brintellix is not recommended for the treatment of depression in children aged 7 to 11 years, since the safety and efficacy of vortioxetine have not been established in this age group. Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1). In general , the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults except for higher incidences reported in adolescents than in adults for abdominal pain-related events and suicidal ideation. In clinical studies in children and adolescents treated with antidepressants, suicide-related behaviour (suicide attempt and suicidal thoughts) and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour, anger) were more frequently observed than in those treated with placebo.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

- 1) The Rapporteur does not consider the safety in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years as 'established' for the reason given by the Applicant, namely that all data available have been provided/reported. Data remain sparse and there are safety concerns (section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1.). Nevertheless, the wording proposed by the Applicant is acceptable. Please add a cross-reference to section 4.8 and 5.1 after abdominal pain related events and suicidal ideation.
- 2) The Applicant has deleted 'other' in the sentence 'In clinical studies in children and adolescents treated with antidepressants, suicide-related behaviour (suicide attempt and suicidal thoughts) and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour, anger) were more frequently observed than in those treated with placebo'. This is endorsed.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved if a cross-reference to section 4.8 and 5.1 is added after 'abdominal pain related events and suicidal ideation'.

- 1) The proposed wording is accepted if a cross-reference to section 4.8 and 5.1 is added after abdominal pain related events and suicidal ideation.
- 2) Deletion of the word 'other' is endorsed.

## Question 4

## SPC section 4.8:

The Applicant did not include the safety results obtained in study 12708A , in children and adolescents, nor the safety interim data from ongoing studies 12712A and 12712B in children and adolescents, in the in the comparative analysis of the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents versus adults.

Since the adolescent data in the comparative analysis are only based on Study 12710A, and numbers are small, it is recommended to further refine the analysis when more data become available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, based on the comparative data provided, it cannot be agreed with, that the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults.

Based on the comparative data provided the following amendment is asked:

In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults except for higher incidences reported in adolescents than in adults for abdominal pain-related events and suicidal ideation.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The Applicant accepts the proposed wording.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

Agreed.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved.

## Question 5

## SPC section 5.1:

Please write instead of 'In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults.':

In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in adolescents was similar to that seen for adults except for higher incidences reported in adolescent than in adults for abdominal pain-related events and suicidal ideation.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The Applicant accepts the proposed wording.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

Agreed.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved.

## Question 6

## PIL section 2:

Please write:

Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated .

The safety of Brintellix in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years has not been established.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Summary of the MAH's response

As the Applicant considers the safety established (in line with response to Question 2), the Applicant proposes the following wording: Brintellix should not be used in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) because efficacy has not been demonstrated. In general, the side effects of vortioxetine for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years was similar to that seen for adults except for more frequent side effects of abdominal pain and suicidal ideation.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The Rapporteur does not consider the safety in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years as 'established' for the reason given by the Applicant, namely that all data available have been provided/reported. Data remain sparse and there are safety concerns (section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1.).

The Applicant is asked to bring the information given in section 2 of the PIL in line with section 4.2 of the SPC, referring to section 4 of the PIL for the safety information regarding adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Please add this safety information in section 4 of the PIL.

## Conclusion

## Issue not resolved.

The Applicant is asked to bring the information given in section 2 of the PIL in line with section 4.2 of the SPC, referring to section 4 of the PIL for the safety information regarding adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Please add this safety information in section 4 of the PIL.

## 13. 3rd Request for supplementary information

## Other concerns

## Question 1

The Applicant is asked to clarify if the recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee to withdraw all adolescent patients from studies 12712A and 12712B was safety driven.

## The Applicant submitted the following answer on 10/09/20:

The recommendation from the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to discontinue adolescent patients in the ongoing extension Studies 12712A and 12712B was based on the lack of efficacy of vortioxetine in Study 12710A in adolescents. The DMC concluded, after having reviewed all data in children and adolescent including unblinded data from the children 12709A, that no safety concerns have been identified in the studies in adolescents or children.

## Rapporteur's conclusion

Issue resolved

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Question 2

In the proposed wording for section 4.4, a cross-reference to section 4.8 and 5.1 should be added after 'abdominal pain related events and suicidal ideation'.

## The Applicant submitted the following answer on 10/09/20:

Lundbeck accepts.

## Rapporteur's comment :

Issue resolved. SmPC has been adapted

## Question 3

The Applicant is asked to bring the information given in section 2 of the PIL in line with section 4.2 of the SPC, referring to section 4 of the PIL for the safety information regarding adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Please add this safety information in section 4 of the PIL.

## The Applicant submitted the following answer on 10/09/20:

Lundbeck accepts and proposes to include the below text in the Patient Leaflet, section 4:

## Additional side effects in adolescents

Side effects observed with vortioxetine in adolescents were similar to those seen for adults except for stomache ache and suicidal thoughts that were observed more often in adolescents than in adults.

## Rapporteur's conclusion:

The point is resolved. The PIL has been updated accordingly
