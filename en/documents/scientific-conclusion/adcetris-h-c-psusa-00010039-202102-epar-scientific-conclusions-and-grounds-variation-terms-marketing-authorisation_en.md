## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for brentuximab vedotin, the scientific conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) from the literature and spontaneous reports including in two literature cases a close temporal relationship, improvement with steroids, meeting the criteria for DRESS from the European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions to Drugs and Collection of Biological Samples, positive de-challenge and in one case positive re-challenge, and a probably post-marketing case, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between brentuximab vedotin and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing brentuximab vedotin should be amended accordingly.

Regarding the risk of extravasation, based on three cases of cellulitis with a close temporal relationship, of which two were serious and two required hospitalisation, it is agreed with the MAH that cellulitis can occur following administration of brentuximab and that it is important for HCPs to be aware of this. The MAH is requested to add the term 'cellulitis' to the footnotes in SmPC section 4.8. Based on MedDRA terminology, the SmPC 4.8 footnotes term 'sloughing' should be replaced with 'skin exfoliation'. Furthermore, a warning on the risk of extravasation reactions for HCPs is considered necessary in section 4.4.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for brentuximab vedotin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing brentuximab vedotin is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.
