## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

The clinical syndrome of hereditary angioedema (HAE) ('swelling of the soft tissues') is related to the congenital  deficiency  of  C1  esterase  inhibitor  (C1INH),  which  is  a  plasma  protein.  Two  types  of congenital functional C1INH deficiency (phenotypic variants) can be distinguished (HAE Type I and HAE Type II). Despite both types being autosomal dominant disorders, the levels of functional C1INH in plasma are much lower than 50 % of normal levels. This probably relates to a lack of control on C1 (auto) activation which results in a higher level of consumption of the inhibitor than in healthy people.

C1INH is primarily synthesized in the liver and its level in normal plasma is about 275 µg/ml (about 2.5 µM). C1INH belongs to the superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins) in plasma. The members of this family, which includes amongst others alpha1-antitrypsin, alpha1-antichymotrypsin,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

alpha2-antiplasmin  and  antithrombin  III  (ATIII),  show  structural  homology  and  share  a  common inhibitory  mechanism.  The  main  function  of  C1  Inhibitor  is  inhibition  of  the  complement  system, which is a biochemical cascade of the immune system. Activation of this system leads to cytolysis, chemotaxis, opsonization, immune clearance, and inflammation, as well as the marking of pathogens for phagocytosis.

C1INH  is  the  only  known  inhibitor  of  activated  subcomponents  C1s  (C1  esterase)  and  C1r  of complement  component  1  (C1)  of  the  classical  pathway  of  the  complement  system.  In  addition, C1INH  inhibits  the  Mannan  Binding  protein  (MBP)-associated  proteinases  (MASPs)  of  Lectin pathway of complement activation. Furthermore, it is the major inhibitor of activated factor XII, factor XI and kallikrein of the contact system of intrinsic coagulation and fibrinolysis. The common final step  of  complement  is  the  activation  of  C5  by  C5  convertase  that  leads  to  the  formation  of  the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) C5b-9, which finally inserts into the target cell membranes and causes cell lysis. The peptides C3a, C4a, and C5a are known as anaphylatoxins and mediate several reactions  in  the  inflammatory  response,  including  smooth  muscle  cell  contractions,  changes  in vascular permeability, histamine release from mast cells, neutrophil chemotaxis, and platelet activation and aggregation.

Most  commonly,  HAE  provokes  swelling  of  the  face,  mouth  and/or  airway  but  such  swelling  can occur in any part of the body. Attacks of oedema of the gastrointestinal tract are associated with severe pain  similar  to  acute  abdominal  syndromes  and  may  cause  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  ascites  and symptoms  of  hypovolemia.  About  35%  of  patients  suffering  from  abdominal  attacks  (stomach, intestines,  bladder)  undergo  appendectomy or exploratory laporotomy due to misdiagnosis of HAE. Until  recently,  the  lethality  rates  of  attacks  involving  the  upper  airways  leading  to  asphyxia  were exceeding 25%.

Currently available treatments include androgens, antifibrinolytics and plasma-derived C1INH. Acute severe  abdominal  and  laryngeal  attacks  can  be  successfully  treated  with  intravenous  infusion  of plasma-derived C1INH. Plasma-derived C1INH is approved in only part of the European Union.

The applicant Pharming Group N.V. submitted a complete and independent application for Marketing Authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMEA)  for  Rhucin.  Rhucin  is  a  recombinant human C1 Inhibitor (rhC1INH), claimed as having the same serine protease inhibitory activity (i.e. C1s, Factors XIa and XIIa, and kallikrein) as human plasma C1 Inhibitor. The proposed indication of Rhucin is for use as replacement treatment in acute attacks of angioedema in patients with congenital C1 inhibitor activity deficiency.

Rhucin  was  designated  as  an  orphan  medicinal  product  in  the  following  indication:  treatment  of angioedema caused by C1 inhibitor deficiency. The calculated prevalence of this condition was 2.1 per 10,000 EU population.

rhC1INH is produced using transgenic rabbits expressing the protein in milk. The transgenic rabbits, which are genetically modified organisms (GMO), are maintained in specific pathogen free enclosed housings in the Netherlands. The product, however, is not a GMO.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

C1INH is a single-chain plasma glycoprotein (Mr 76,000; 478 amino acids; cDNA 1.8 kb; gene 17 kb; heavily  glycosylated:  about  30  %  w/w  carbohydrate,  2  disulphide  bonds)  that  belongs  to  the superfamily  of  serine  proteinase  inhibitors  (serpins)  in  plasma.  C1INH  is  a  heavily  glycosylated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

protein but glycosylation is not required for its inhibitory activity. Recombinant human C1 Inhibitor (rhC1INH), the active substance of Rhucin, is produced in transgenic rabbits that express the protein in  milk.  The  mRNA  transcription  product  predicts  that  rhC1INH  will  have  the  same  amino  acid structure as C1INH.

Rhucin is presented as a powder for solution for injection to be reconstituted with water for injections before  intravenous  administration.  Each  vial  contains  2100  units  of  rhC1INH  (150  U/ml  after reconstitution).

## Active Substance

## · Manufacture

The manufacture of the milk starting material, which includes breeding, maintenance and milking of transgenic  rabbits,  is  performed  by  a  manufacturer  in  the  Netherlands    in  compliance  with  Good Manufacturing  Practice  (GMP).  The  transgenic  rabbits  are  considered  to  be  genetically  modified organisms  (GMO).  The  manufacturer  has  been  authorised  by  the  Dutch  authorities  to  handle transgenic rabbits in a contained environment and the rabbit housing areas are classified as D-1 animal facilities in accordance with GMO regulations in the Netherlands.

The  active  substance  is  manufactured  and  routinely  controlled  by  a  second  manufacturer  in  the Netherlands in compliance with GMP.

The  manufacturing  process  for  rhC1INH  starts  with  the  production  of  milk  starting  material  which involves milking of rabbits, skimming of milk, filling in bags and freezing.

The downstream processing of the milk consists of thawing of milk, pooling of milk bags, fat removal by  centrifugation  and  a  succession  of  filtration  and  chromatography  steps  as  well  solvent/detergent treatment.

The process includes 2 virus removal/inactivation steps and formulation by ultra- and diafiltration.

The  manufacturing  process,  including  the  handling  of  the  transgenic  rabbits,  has  been  adequately described  and  validated.  Three  commercial  scale  validation  batches,  and  26  commercial  batches  in total  have  been  manufactured  and  in-process  control,  batch  release  and  extensive  additional  testing have shown that manufacture is well controlled overall.

Sufficient information was provided regarding derivation of genomic/promoter DNA and generation of the genetic founder animal in the genome of which the sequence coding for rhC1INH was inserted. The genetic testing on animals generated to date confirms that in a number of animals, a reduced copy number is present. Given the instability of the genetics of the production colony, methods of control are in place to assure the genetic acceptability of those animals accepted into the production colony. The  number  of  generations  between  the  Master  Transgenic  Bank  (MTB)  and  the  animals  used  for production is limited and fixed and the breeding males are screened to ensure they have the required number of copies of the transgene. This strategy limits the extent of the instability in the production colony. Genetic testing and specifications of breeding and production animals are such that mutation and copy number are satisfactorily controlled.

A  combination  of  state-of-the-art  techniques  have  been  used  to  characterise  rhC1INH.  Protein sequencing has revealed large proportion of the amino acid structure, including all sites of N-linked glycosylation and sites of O-linked glycosylation. The applicant committed  to improve the characterisation of the primary structure. An appropriate method has been used as a characterisation tool  and  has  also  been  introduced  as  a  batch  release  assay.  Similarly,  the  N-linked  and  O-linked oligosaccharide  profiles  have  also  been  characterised  on  the  validation  batches  and  will  have  to  be incorporated in the batch release analysis. Monosaccharide composition has been characterised for a large number of batches and is a batch release assay. Product charge heterogeneity was not measured, due  to  the  comparatively  large  amount  of  glycosylation  of  the  product  making  development  of  a suitable assay  difficult. Nevertheless,  the  applicant  agreed  to  develop  a  quantitative  method, characterise  validation  batches,  and  introduce  this  test  as  a  batch  release  assay  since  this  is  an important  characteristic  of  all  glycoproteins,  and  especially  from  a  transgenic  source,  where  post translational modifications are not yet well understood. Molecular weight has been characterised by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

several methods. The molecular weight is significantly less than human plasma derived C1INH due to differences in glycosylation. This may impact on the pharmacokinetics of rhC1INH and reduce its half life (see non-clinical and clinical aspects).

Product  related  impurities  have  been  monitored  in  pilot  scale  batches,  and  some  are  analysed  by peptide  map  for  batch  release.  Although  commercial  scale  validation  batches  have  not  been specifically analysed for these impurities, forced degradation studies reveal that the product is stable with regard to these impurities under mild process and storage conditions. Therefore it is considered not to be necessary to perform batch analysis for these impurities.

The  relative  activities  of  rhC1INH  and  human  plasma  derived  C1INH  have  been  compared  by calculating  second  order  rate  constants  of  inhibition  for  4  substrates  of  C1INH:  C1s  proteinase, Factors XIa and XIIa, and kallikrein. Results show that the rate constants obtained with rhC1INH and human plasma derived C1INH are similar. This indicates that the differences in glycosylation do not greatly  influence  activity  of  this  protein.  Still,  the  differences  in  glycosylation  may  impact  on  the pharmacokinetics (half life), stability and potential immunogenicity of the product (see non clinical and clinical aspects).

The  applicant  has  provided  robust  data  to  support  the  consistency  of  the  product  regarding  both characterisation of biochemical/structural properties, and product purity.

- The genetic stability of the rabbit colony is well controlled (see above)
- The raw material (milk) for each batch of active substance is analysed for each production run, including the gross milk protein composition of the pool by an adequate method. Characterisation of several batches of milk indicate that the composition regarding the major milk proteins is relatively consistent.
- The  applicant  has  validated  a  consistent  down  stream  purification  process,  and  within  the limits of the assays used (see discussion), have demonstrated that the process has additional capacity for the removal of milk proteins.
- Analysis of active substance demonstrate a consistent product. None of these methods detect significant  quantities  of  Host  Related  Impurities  (HRI)  however  there  are  concerns  as  to whether the assays used provide complete information on HRI (see discussion).
- Characterisation data,  regarding  primary structure, and post translational  modifications (e.g. monosaccharide  composition,  N-glycan  and  O-glycan  analysis  and  sialic  acid  content)  has been provided for up to 26 batches of commercial product (see hereafter).

However, although product purity is likely to be consistent for the reasons detailed above, the actual purity of the product with respect to HRI (milk proteins) has not been adequately demonstrated (see discussion).

During  the  development  cycle,  and  production  of  pre-clinical,  clinical  and  commercial  material, several  changes  have  been  made  to  the  manufacturing  process  including  use  of  different  contract manufacturing organisations and scale up. The applicant has undertaken a comparability study which encompasses batch release data from  development and commercial batches, in-process control  data from  development  and  commercial  batches  plus  additional  characterisation  and  a  pharmacokinetics study performed in rats. Results using a number of methods, are very similar. Inhibitory kinetics of pilot  and  commercial  scale  material  are  essentially  the  same  and  overall  comparability  of  active substance has been demonstrated.

## · Specification

Critical parameters have been included in the active substance specifications to routinely confirm the quality of the active substance by a series of state-of-the-art methods which have been demonstrated to be suitable and have been adequately validated except for the method used to control Host Related Impurities (HRI) (see discussion) as well as a number of remaining concerns which would have to be addressed as part of follow-up measures undertaken by the company.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Stability

The stability of active substance has been monitored in well controlled and justified stability studies which support the claimed shelf life (2 years at -20°C). Nevertheless, the stability studies for frozen skimmed milk (starting material) are not sufficiently satisfactory and the applicant should continue to monitor the protein profile of skimmed milk using a fully validated assay from 0 to at least 24 months when held under commercial storage condition.

## Medicinal product

Rhucin is an aseptic lyophilised cake in a 25 ml Type I glass vial (Ph.Eur.), sealed with a siliconised 20 mm chlorobutyl '2-pin' lyophilisation stopper and capped with an aluminium overseal.  Each vial contains 350 mg (2100 Units) of rhC1INH.  The product is stored at 5°C ± 3 ° C.  For administration of the  product,  the  lyophilised  cake  is  resuspended  with  14.0  ml  water  for  injections  (supplied  by  the user) to prepare a solution at 25 mg/ml (150 U/ml) which is administered by intravenous injection.

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The composition of the finished product is identical to the composition of the active substance. No additional  excipients  or  formulation  steps  are  involved  in  the  manufacture  of  the  product.  The formulation does not contain any anti-microbial preservative and sterility testing is performed on each batch  of  product.  Excipients  are  commonly  used  in  freeze-dried  pharmaceutical  preparations  and include a buffer system and cryoprotectant. Apart from the active substance, no materials of human or animal origin are included in the formulation. Development of the formulation was described and is considered acceptable.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The finished product is manufactured and routinely controlled by a manufacturer in the Netherlands in compliance with GMP.

The product is manufactured by thawing one to four batches of formulated active substance, mixing, sterile  filtration,  aseptic  filling  followed  by  freeze-drying,  labelling  and  packaging.  The  process  has been adequately validated on the basis of 3 batches comprised of a single batch of active substance, and 3 batches comprised of four batches of active substance. In-process control and batch release data, along with extended testing demonstrate that this process is adequately controlled.

## · Product Specification

Critical parameters have been included in the product specifications to routinely confirm the quality of the finished product by testing.

The activity-unit of rhC1INH is based on the C1 Inhibitor plasma unit definition: 1 unit (U) equals the inhibitory  activity  of  1  ml  pooled  human  plasma  towards  the  main  natural  target  of  the  inhibitor, human C1s protease. An international standard is not available so the activity is calibrated on pooled human plasma. For this purpose, a citrated pool of 1000-1500 donors, obtained from a vendor was used. Several internal standards were established during development.

Batch  release  specifications  are  generally  acceptable,  although  on  the  basis  of  batch  release  data obtained to date, some parameters should be tightened after manufacture of an appropriate number of batches.

## · Stability of the Product

The  stability  of  the  product  is  monitored  by  well  designed  and  controlled  studies,  which  include product batches comprised of single and four-fold batches of rhC1INH. To date, 18 months real time data (single rhC1INH batches) and 6 months (4-fold rhC1INH batches) have been obtained. It can be concluded from these studies that Rhucin is stable for 18 months at 5°C ± 3°C and at 25°C ± 2°C / 60% RH ± 5% and for 6 months at 40°C ± 2°C/75% RH ± 5%. Overall, results support the claimed shelf life of 2 years at 25°C although the studies should be continued as detailed in the protocol.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Adventitious Agents

The adventitious agents safety evaluation demonstrates a comprehensive series of controls to minimise the risk of contamination of finished product with non-viral and viral adventitious agents. A three fold approach  has  been  adopted  including  control  of  the  production  colony  by  barrier  technology  and monitoring  of  production  and  sentinel  animals,  monitoring  the  raw  material  by  in  vitro  testing  on susceptible cell lines, and by validating the capacity of the process to remove or inactivate adventitious pathogens.  The  downstream  process  includes  two  specific  effective  virus  reduction/inactivation procedures, a solvent/detergent incubation, and a nanofiltration procedure using small pore nanometre filters.  Validation  of  a  chromatographic  step  which  has  been  indicated  to  contribute  moderately towards virus reduction may be completed in an on-going procedure. Although it is not possible to monitor for every possible pathogen, the sampling regime and pathogens tested for largely conforms to  guidance. In addition, the on-going monitoring of the health of the colony would be expected to quickly detect the presence of a pathogen in the colony. A risk assessment has been conducted of the capacity  of  the  downstream  process  to  remove  pathogens  which  may  be  present  at  the  limits  of detection  of  the  in  vitro  assay  which  is  performed  on  every  batch  of  raw  material  (milk),  which confirms that the downstream process should be effective at removing undetected virus.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

rhC1INH  is  produced  from  milk  obtained  from  transgenic  rabbits.  Milk  is  a  complex  mixture  of proteins.  The  major  proteins  (aS1-casein,  aS2a-casein,  aS2b-casein,  kappa  casein,  beta-casein, transferrin, whey acid protein, IgG, IgA, IgM, albumin, and a-lactalbumin) are mainly manufactured in  the  mammary  gland  and  many  are  under  the  control  of  lactation  specific  promoters.  However, plasma  proteins  can  also  diffuse  from  the  bloodstream  through  the  blood/mammary  barrier  and  be present in low quantities in milk. The extent of leakage varies, and can be quite profound, potentially resulting in significant quantities of blood in the milk (sufficient to give it a noticeable red colour in worst cases, such as mastitis). Therefore, it is not sufficient to only be concerned about the classic milk proteins  since  plasma  proteins  also  have  to  be  considered  Although  generally  plasma  proteins  are present  in  milk  in  low  concentrations,  co-partitioning  with  product  during  purification  can  result  in immunologically  significant  quantities  (i.e.  that  may  cause  antibody  responses  and  related  adverse events) being present in product. In this instance, other members of the serpin family in addition to C1INH  should  be  specifically  considered  since  members  of  the  serpin  family  have  a  conserved structure  and  many  structural  similarities,  resulting  in  a  greater  possibility  of  co-purification  with rhC1INH.

At  the  oral  clarification  (new  information),  the  applicant  indicated  that  this  has  been  addressed  by nominating  rabbit  C1INH  as  a  marker  blood  protein  and  demonstrating  a  relatively  consistent concentration in pooled milk starting material. By proposing to introduce this as a batch release assay and specification for starting material, the applicant will be adequately controlling the starting material for variability in blood proteins.

Product purity has been probed by silver stained SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting and HRI-ELISA (host related impurities-ELISA), the latter two techniques using a polyclonal antibody mixture obtained by pooling antibodies obtained from animals immunised with milk or skimmed milk. Low levels of three purified standards (rabbit milk proteins) can be detected by silver stain if no rhC1INH is co-loaded onto the lane of the gel, but in order to obtain sufficient sensitivity to probe for impurities in product, very large amounts of product had to be loaded onto the gels. This resulted in product (and product related  impurity)  bands  which  covered  approximately  the  45  to  150  K.Daltons  range  of  the  gel. Therefore, many potential impurities which would be present in relatively low concentration, could be hidden by the product bands. The validation of the immunoblot to provide a limit of detection of milk proteins  was  not  adequately  controlled,  and  so  the  limits  provided  by  the  technique  are  not meaningful. In addition, some bands have been visualised by the anti-milk antibodies.

Consequently, the purity of the product has not been conclusively demonstrated and it should also be probed using a variety of separation techniques which use differing mechanisms, and sensitive, state of the art detection techniques.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With the oral clarification, the applicant has provided new information to give further assurance about the  purity  of  the  product.  The  immunoblot  method has  now been adequately controlled, confirming that large concentrations of product do not affect the sensitivity of the method. In a complementary experiment, non-transgenic rabbit milk has been purified in a scale down version of the commercial process  and  no  impurity  bands  are  detected  in  product.  Both  provide  additional  assurance  about product purity.

The HRI-ELISA, which has been used to characterise the purity of intermediates during characterisation studies,  and  for  batch  release  of  active  substance  has  been  designed  and  developed using  the  same  principles  as  HRI-ELISAs  to  fermentation  based  products.  Results  from  this  assay indicate that the total HRI content of active substance is in the region of 10 ppm (~10 µg per 1000 mg adult dose). The standard curve is made from dilutions of skimmed milk and the applicant has been requested to ensure that titration curves of important milk proteins are similar to the titration curve of standard. The important proteins for which this is performed should be justified, either on the basis of being detected in active substance, or likely impurities from analysis of milk or intermediates. If the titration curves are too dissimilar from the standard, then the quantitative result from the ELISA would not  be  meaningful.  In  practice,  the  ELISA  may  only  measure  one  or  two  of  the  most  prevalent  or immunogenic  milk  proteins  and  not  effectively  quantitate  the  more  minor  components.  Thus,  low concentrations of some milk proteins and proteins which co-purify with product may be un-detected by  this  assay.  This  level  of  validation  is  not  always  required  of  similar  ELISAs  for  fermentation derived  products,  but  it  should  be  remembered  that  there  tends  to  be  a  considerable  amount  of information available about the immunogenicity of HRI from conventional cell based products, and frequently the dose size is considerably smaller than in this case. The immunogenicity of milk proteins administered i.v. is not well understood, and, although the route of administration was different, it has been  previously  noted  for  product  administered  on  a  repeat  basis  to  the  lungs  via  a  nebuliser  that amounts of (sheep)  individual  milk  proteins  above  1.5  µg  (~ 6 ppm  in  250  mg  of  product)  tend  to cause antibody formation in some patients, and when the amount of individual sheep milk protein is approximately 15 µg (60 ppm in 250 mg of product), then essentially 100% of subjects  developed antibodies to these individual proteins.

New quantitative data was provided at the oral clarification to show that the residual quantities of 3 marker milk proteins is very low or undetectable. In addition, the applicant has committed to explore and if necessary to improve the sensitivity of the HRI-ELISA as follows. They will continue to probe the purity of product for HRI using complementary techniques to those which have been employed. In addition, the specificity of antibodies which are raised by subjects after dosing with Rhucin will be examined  using  a  combination  of  newly  developed  analytical  tools.  If  it  is  found  that  patients  are raising antibodies to specific HRI, then further analytical techniques will be developed and introduced in batch analysis to control for these.

In conclusion, except for remaining outstanding quality issues, the applicant has provided assurance regarding the quality of the product. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are mostly controlled. Data have been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

The remaining concerns relate to host related impurities (HRI), the inadequate control of HRI in the product  and  the  use  of  a  method  (HRI-ELISA)  which  has  not  been  adequately  validated,  and inadequate  validation  of  the  clinical  assay  for  detection  of  human  antibodies  raised  to  rabbit  milk proteins. In response to these concerns, the applicant has provided additional information in an oral clarification.  The  additional  information  was  promising  but  still  needs  to  be  thoroughly  evaluated before it can be concluded that the quality of this product is acceptable to support safe and effective use  of  Rhucin.  In  addition,  there  are  a  number  of  remaining  concerns  which  would  have  to  be addressed  as  part  of  follow-up  measures  undertaken  by  the  company  to  ensure  that  host  related impurities will be appropriately controlled and that the product will be consistent with material used in clinical trials.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Two  different  pharmaceutical  presentations  were  developed:  a  liquid  formulation  of  25  mg/ml  in 20mM citrate buffer pH7.0 with 8% sucrose, and a freeze-dried presentation containing 6.5% sucrose serving as cryoprotectant. Liquid presentations were used in early non-clinical studies. Later studies were performed with the lyophilized presentations.

The non-clinical testing program was conducted to establish the safety of rhC1 INH for short term use (&lt; 7 days) in this potentially life-threatening disease.

Studies  presented  covered in  vitro pharmacology, in  vivo safety  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics, general toxicology with dosing of up to two weeks, teratology in rats and local tolerance.

Protocol Assistance from EMEA was obtained in November 2003 on quality, preclinical and clinical aspects.

The pivotal studies were performed under GLP.

## Pharmacology

- Primary pharmacodynamics

Four in vitro studies assessing kinetics of binding with enzymes that are presumed to be inhibited by the product (C1s, FXIa, FXIIa, kallikrein) were reported as the primary  pharmacodynamic characterisation of rhC1 INH. These studies report the second order rate constant of inhibition (kon) of rhC1 INH, in comparison with that of human plasma-derived C1 INH, for batches used in preclinical and clinical studies. The results are presented in the table below.

(b) Datareportedinliterature

(c) Data reported in literature

These findings demonstrated that the inhibitory activity of rhC1INH towards the target proteinases can regarded to be comparable with plasma derived C1 inhibitor.

- Secondary Pharmacodynamics and Safety Pharmacology

Safety  pharmacology  was  assessed  in  one in  vivo study  evaluating  the  effect  of  rhC1INH  on cardiovascular and respiratory systems in anaesthetised dog.

Vehicle  or  625  U/kg  (corresponding  to  104  mg/kg)  rhC1INH  was  administered  intravenously  in  a crossover  design.  Compared  to  the  proposed  clinical  dose  of  15  mg/kg,  this  choice  of  dose  is acceptable

There were no marked changes in the QTCB interval following treatment with vehicle or rhC1INH. No treatment-related effects were observed for the remaining monitored parameters.

- Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No studies were performed.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics of rhC1INH were investigated in rats and dogs. The species used for analyses of pharmacokinetics were also used in the safety pharmacology and toxicology studies. Single  intravenous  dose  administration  of  several  rhC1INH  batches  was  studied  in  rats.  Results  of toxicokinetic blood sampling during toxicology studies in rats and dogs (single dose toxicity rats and escalating dose toxicity in dogs) were also presented.

## Methods

Two methods for quantification of rhC1 INH in plasma were described.  The first was a functional assay using the commercially available C1-inhibitor kit.  This kit is used in clinical medicine for the determination  of  the  functional  activity  of  C1-inhibitor  in  plasma  to  diagnose  states  of  reduced  C1 inhibitor concentration in plasma and for monitoring substitution therapy in patients.

Validation  of  this  method  was  shown  for  rat,  dog  and  human  plasma  samples.  Stability  of  plasma samples at room temperature was assured for at least 72 hours, and at -18ºC for at least 61 days, with stability over three freeze-thaw cycles.

The  second  method  was  an  ELISA  which  was  applied  to  rat  and  dog  plasma  samples  and  was validated for the range 0.0117 to 0.188 mU/ml.

Validation reports for the assessment of antibodies to rhC1 INH in rat plasma and their neutralising potential were provided and considered acceptable in spite of some deficiencies.

The  ELISA used  in  toxicity  studies  met  the  validation  criteria  for  precision  and  specificity  at  low, medium and high concentrations of anti-rhC1INH IgG

## Absorption

Data on PK parameters following intravenous administration in rats and dogs were provided. As the product  is  intended  for  intravenous  administration  only,  no  studies  in  animals  were  done  by  other routes and no studies were conducted to assess bioavailability.

## Distribution

No specific studies assessing distribution of rhC1INH were reported. However, from the single dose administration of rhC1INH in rats and escalating dose administration in dogs, the Cmax values were considered to be in accordance with the measured concentration of the injected dose.

## Metabolism

The role of hepatic receptors in removing rhC1INH from the blood circulation was studied in a nonGLP single dose pharmacokinetic study. RhC1INH was administered in male Wistar rats treated with competitors for the asialoglycoprotein receptor on parenchymal liver cells and the mannose receptor on liver endothelial cells.

Results  indicate  that  the  exposure  and  half  life  were  each  greater  and  the  elimination  rate  constant (ERC  in  the  table  below)  was  reduced  when  either,  or  both,  inhibitors  were  injected  just  prior  to injection of rhC1 INH. These results suggest that rhC1INH is mainly cleared from the circulation by the liver via receptor-mediated endocytosis.

## Excretion

No specific excretion studies were reported as, according to the applicant, the pathway of amino acid degradation is generally understood. This was considered to be acceptable for this product.

## Other Pharmacokinetic Studies

Pharmacokinetic comparison of batches of liquid formulation with batches of lyophilized formulation failed to demonstrate comparability between both formulations.

However, the analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters of 10 batches of lyophilised pilot scale product demonstrates consistent results within the experiment performed.

Results shown in the table below indicate that the half life of rhC1 INH was less than 20 minutes and the  volume  of  distribution  was  close  to  the  blood  volume.    No  difference  was  seen  between  the batches.

An additional  study  comparing  2  pilot  scale  and  3  commercial  scale  batches  of  rhC1INH  revealed differences for Cmax and AUC between groups. However no significant differences in pharmacokinetic  parameters  between  pilot  scale  and  commercial  scale  batches  and  between  two different commercial scale batches were observed. Overall, bioanalytical comparability was considered to be demonstrated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Toxicology

The toxicology program was designed to reflect the anticipated short-term use of rhC1INH in humans, and included single-dose studies in rats and dogs, repeat-dose studies in rats (up to 2 weeks) and dogs (up to 5 days) as well as a reproductive and developmental toxicology study in rats.

Toxicokinetic  assessments  were  incorporated  into  the  reproductive  toxicity  studies  to  determine exposure and corresponding safety exposure margins. Other toxicity studies included assessments of local tolerance in rabbits and antigenicity.

- Single dose toxicity

One single dose toxicity study was conducted in rats using intravenous administration. rhC1 INH was administered once at doses of 0, 25, 125, 625 and 1250 U/kg.

There were no deaths. Treatment-related clinical signs were mainly pilo-erection at the highest dose. In addition, the enlargement of spleen in 2/3 male rats may be evidence for immunological reactions. The maximal exposure to functional rhC1 INH in this study was achieved in rats given the highest dose,  1250  U/kg.  The  mean  maximal  concentration  was  18,562  mU/ml  (3094  mcg/ml).    In comparison, plasma concentration in patients after the proposed dose of 100 U/kg (approximating to the  recommended  dose  of  15  mg/kg)  was  typically  between  2,000  and  3,000  mU/ml.  This concentration was achieved in some rats given 125 U/kg.

Overall,  the  study  demonstrated  tolerability  at  doses  achieving  about  7  to  9  fold  excess  the  human plasma concentration.

There was no effect on coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters in this study. Considering the objective of the product is to interfere with coagulation, fibrinolysis, complement and kinin-releasing systems, the apparent absence of such effect even at large doses should be discussed by the applicant.

## Repeat-dose toxicity

Toxicity after repeated dose was assessed in three studies, two, and one in the dog using repeated daily administration for 5 days.

In the rat , 2 studies were conducted, one using repeated daily administration for 4 days and one with continuous infusion over 14 days.

In the 4-day study rats were treated with rhC1 INH, from two batches, by slow intravenous infusion at doses of 0, 625 and 1250U/kg once per day and with 1250 U/kg twice per day, with a 7 hour interval between doses, for 4 consecutive days with toxicokinetic evaluation. In addition, 5 rats/sex were kept for a recovery period of 10 days. Anti-rhC1 INH antibody determination was undertaken on all rats, using samples taken just prior to termination on Days 4 and 14.

Almost  all  rhC1  INH-treated  rats  had  a  swollen  muzzle  and/or  limbs  after  treatment.  Swelling persisted beyond 7 hours for several animals but regressed within 24 hours. The incidence of swelling generally decreased as the study progressed.

There were no other signs of overt toxicity, no significant findings in laboratory investigations and no identified target organ of toxicity after histopathological examination.

Among  90  rats  given  rhC1  INH,  34  tested  positive  for  IgG  antibodies  (38%).    There  was  no correlation of antibody titre with dose, sex or whether rats were killed on Day 4 or 14.

This study indicates that rhC1 INH had little toxicity in rats when administered by daily intravenous injection for 4 days.

After  two  week  recovery  period  product-specific  antibody  (IgG)  titres  were  determined  by  ELISA. None or only relatively low rhC1INH-specific antibody titres were measured in all groups.

In the second repeated dose toxicity Dawley rats received a continuous intravenous infusion at doses of 25, 125 or 625 U/kg/day rhC1INH and 625 U/kg/day pdC1INH for 14 consecutive days, followed by a 14-day observation period, and including toxicokinetics. This dosing route design (i.e. continuous

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

infusion) was chosen to try to avoid immunogenicity associated with repeated bolus administration of Rhucin.

There were no effects of rhC1 INH detected on any parameters measured in the study. The NOEL was therefore  determined  to  be  625  U/kg.  In  the  comparator  product  (plasma  derived  C1INH)  group, minimal  changes  in  haematological  and  clinical  biochemical  parameters  and  in  organ  weights (increases to liver, kidney and spleen) were observed.

The exposure to rhC1 INH achieved in this was significantly less than that achieved in other studies and was less with Rhucin than with the comparator Esterasine.

The maximum reported plasma concentration was 14.3 mU/ml in this study, compared to rats treated with  the  same  intravenous  dose  of  625  U/kg  rhC1  INH  once,  where  a  plasma  concentration  in  the range of  2351 - 3635 mU/ml was reported 2 hours after dosing.

The active comparator group had substantially greater exposure (concentrations range from 3179 to 6206 mU/ml in accordance with previous studies.

The low exposure was explained by faster clearance of rhC1INH compared to plasma derived C1INH through  receptor-mediated  endocytosis  by  the  liver.  Based  on  this  limited  exposure,  the  study  was considered to be of limited toxicological relevance.

Investigation  of  antibody  titres  was  performed  for  three  groups  (625  U/kg  rhC1INH,  625  U/kg pdC1INH and vehicle) in order to  determine the immunogenicity of the test substance in rats after prolonged exposure. After five days no significant differences was found between groups. However, after day 16 and day 29, differences in antibody titres between rhC1INH and vehicle became highly significant. In addition, the titres of the rats dosed with plasma-derived C1INH were not significantly increased  as  compared  to  the  control  group.  Although  these  findings  were  regarded  to  be  not  fully predictive for the human use of rhC1INH, they might suggest differences in immunogenic properties of both either rhC1INH or pdC1INH. The immunogenic potency of plasma derived C1INH was not assessed in this study as immunogenicity was assessed using a validated test for rhC1INH.

In the dog, toxicity was investigated in a dose escalation study for 5 consecutive days administering doses  of  25,  125,  625,  or  1250  U/kg  rhC1INH  intravenously  into  2  male  and  2  female,  including toxicokinetic sampling.

There were no mortality or clinical signs of overt toxicity in either stage of this study. Total white blood cell and platelet counts were decreased with reductions in the relative proportion of segmented neutrophils and increases in lymphocytes in both sexes. Neither APTT nor PT were altered by treatment with rhC1 INH. Histopathological examination of all tissues did not reveal treatment-related findings.

It was concluded that 5 daily treatments of 625 U/kg (104 mg/kg) did not results in toxic effects and that  daily  escalating  doses  that  reached  1250  U/kg  (208  mg/kg)  were  not  associated  with  overt toxicity.

Toxicokinetic  measurements  demonstrated  tolerability  at  doses  achieving  about  7  fold  excess  the human plasma concentration. (see toxicokinetic section).

Overall, the dose escalating study in dogs did not reveal treatment related adverse effects.

## Genotoxicity

No genotoxicity studies were performed on the basis that the drug is unlikely to interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal material, in accordance with current guidelines (ICH S6)

## Carcinogenicity

No carcinogenicity studies were performed, on the basis that such studies are generally inappropriate for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals. It is accepted that, based on the duration of clinical dosing and  in  view  of  its  biological  activity,  rhC1  INH  does  not  pose  a  carcinogenic  risk.  This  is  also  in agreement with current guidelines (ICH S6).

## Reproductive and developmental toxicity

An  embryo-fetal  development  study  in  pregnant  rats  to  assess  the  potential  for  teratogenicity  was performed by intravenous injection at one dose level of 625 U/kg with a parallel control group. Embryo-fetal toxicity evaluation in a single species was considered acceptable given the acute lifethreatening disease and the short-term emergency use of the product.

During dosing, all drug-treated dams were observed to have swollen muzzles and limbs for up to 4 hours  after  dosing.  However,  there  were  no  other  anbormalities  noted  in  the  dams,  including  at necropsy. No adverse effects on the different parameters of pregnancy were observed. No external, visceral or skeletal abnormalities were noted in fetuses and there was no difference in the number or type of skeletal anomalies or variations.

Toxicokinetic measurements were of limited values as the sampling was performed 24h after dosing leading to values of endogenous concentration of C1INH. There was no evidence of development of IgG antibodies to rhC1 INH.

Studies on fertility, early embryonic and postnatal development were not performed. It could not be excluded that Rhucin will cross the placenta; fetal exposure and transfer in milk in lactating patients could  not  be  excluded  as  there  were  no  data  to  support  this  view.  However,  Rhucin  was  rapidly eliminated  by  receptor-mediated  endocytosis.  Given  the  acute  life-threatening  nature  of  the  disease and  the  short-term  emergency  use,  the  absence  of  such  data  was  considered  to  be  acceptable.  A corresponding statement should be mentioned in the SPC.

## Local tolerance

Local tolerance was evaluated following administration of the liquid formulation in rabbits and. in the 4-day  rat  toxicity  study  using  the  lyophilised  formulation.  No  concerns  for  local  intolerance  were observed across these studies.

- Toxicokinetic data

Toxicokinetic data from treated rats (4-day study) are shown in the table below.

- Toxicokinetic parameters from treated groups were as follows:

* given as 2 doses of 1250 U/kg with a 7 hour interval

| Occasion   | Dose (U/kg/day)   | Sex         | Cmax (mU/mL)   | AUCg-2h (mU.h/mL)   |

The  systemic  exposure  was  similar  after  the  first  or  the  second  daily  administration  and  no accumulation was observed between days 0 and 2. AUC values increased proportionally between 625 and 1250 U/kg/day for both sexes. There were no sex differences in Cmax and AUC. The Cmax data were approximately 10 fold the highest Cmax in human subjects at the recommended dose.

Toxicokinetic results in the dog (escalating dose study) are presented in the table below.

## Thrombogenicity

No  specific  studies  were  performed  investigating  the  thrombogenic  potential,  and  this  remained  a concern. (see 'Discussion on non-clinical aspects' section).

## Antigenicity

Investigation of antibody titres was performed in repeat-dose studies as described above. In the rat, differences in antibody titres between rhC1INH and vehicle became highly significant at the end of the investigation period whereas titres of the rats dosed with plasma-derived C1INH were not significantly increased as compared to the control group.

## · Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

According to the current guideline, the lack of environmental risk assessment studies is justified in view  of  the  nature  of  the  active  substance  (protein)  and  of  the  orphan  medicinal  product  status. Therefore no risk to the environment is expected.

## Discussion on Non-Clinical aspects

The in  vitro target  protease  inhibition  investigation  demonstrated  that  the  inhibitory  activity  of rhC1INH towards the target proteinases can be regarded to be comparable with plasma derived C1 inhibitor.  The  safety  pharmacology study performed in dogs revealed no significant effects on vital functions such as cardiovascular or respiratory system.

Pharmacokinetic parameters have been characterised in the species used and bioanalytical comparability  between  batches  was  considered  to  be  demonstrated.  Clearance  of  the  product  is occurring through receptor-mediated endocytosis by the liver.

Single-dose  and  repeat  dose  toxicity  of  rhC1INH  were  assessed  in  rats  and  dogs.  No  significant treatment related adverse effects were observed at plasma concentrations corresponding to about 6 to 10 times the human exposure.

In the rat, differences in antibody titres between rhC1INH and vehicle became highly significant at the end of the investigation period whereas titres of the rats dosed with plasma-derived C1INH were not significantly increased as compared to the control group. These findings might suggest differences in immunogenic properties of both either rhC1INH or pdC1INH. The immunogenic potency of plasma derived C1INH was not assessed in this study as immunogenicity was assessed using a validated test for rhC1INH.

No  genototoxic  or  carcinogenic  potential  is  expected  from  this  biotechnology-derived  product, justifying the absence of such studies.

The  reproductive  toxicology  did  not  indicate  a  teratogenic  or  fetotoxic  effect  of  rhC1  INH  in  rats. Given the acute life-threatening nature of the disease and the short-term emergency use of the product, the lack of a teratology assessment in a non-rodent species in teratology assessment was considered acceptable. Potential effects on fertility and on peri- and postnatal development were not studied and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

no data of transfer into milk are available. This should be mentioned in the SPC. No concerns for local tolerance were observed across all studies.

No risk for the environment is expected.

C1INH targets proteinases in the complement cascade and clotting pathway (factor XI, factor XII and kallikrein).  Since  C1  inhibitors  can  also  inhibit  serine  proteinases  like  plasmin  and  tissue-type plasminogen activator of the fibrinolytic system, induction of thrombogenicity may be an issue which should be evaluated in non-clinical safety studies for this type of product. Due to its PK profile Rhucin has  to  be  administered  in  relatively  high  doses  when  compared  to  plasma  derived  products.  The biological effects of a sudden increase of C1INH activity in plasma from subnormal values in patients with HAE below 0.4 U/ml to a peak up to 5 U/ml were not considered. Since the number of patients treated with Rhucin was small, a potential thromboembolic risk can not be excluded. A non-clinical study  investigating  comparative  thrombogenic  potential  of  Rhucin  with  the  human  plasma-derived product in order to demonstrate whether the intended clinical use of Rhucin does pose a thrombogenic risk was not performed.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

Clinical data submitted for Rhucin were derived from the following clinical trials:

- Study C1 1101-01: A Phase I study in patients with asymptomatic HAE;
- Study C1 1202-01: A Phase II exploratory open-label study;
- Study C1 1203-01: A Phase II/III open-label study;
- Study  C1  1106-02:  A  Phase  I  study  investigating  repeated  intravenous  doses  of  rhC1INH  in healthy volunteers.

Studies C1 1202-01 and C1 1203-01 were the main efficacy studies, evaluating rhC1INH at the single dose of  100  U/kg  in  symptomatic  HAE patients.  The  main  pharmacodynamic results were derived from studies C1 1101-01, C1 1202-01 and C1 1203-01, whereas both pharmacokinetic and safety data were mostly derived from all four clinical studies.

A further two controlled clinical studies (C1 1205-01 and C1 1304-01) were in progress at the time of the evaluation. Study C1 1205-01 was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase II study on  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  rhC1INH  at  doses  of  50  and  100U/kg  in  relieving  eligible  attacks  of angioedema with involvement of submucosal tissues in patients with HAE. Results from this study were  not  available.  Study  C1  1304-01  was  a  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind,  multicentre study performed in order to demonstrate the efficacy of rhC1INH at 100 U/kg in patients with HAE with attacks of angioedema. Data from an interim analysis on Study C1 1304-01 were provided at day 121 of the procedure (July 2007), and were assessed and taken into account in the evaluation.

## Regulatory Guidance and Advice

The  applicant  justified  the  open-label  trials  for  demonstrating  efficacy  during  the  oral  hearing  of  a protocol assistance procedure at EMEA (November 2003). At that time results were available on the treatment with rhC1INH of only one attack of HAE.

The  EMEA  did  not  endorse  the  applicant's  proposal  for  open-label  trials  and  proposed  an  activecontrolled study. The applicant initiated a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial (C1 1304-01) to demonstrate rhC1INH efficacy in the treatment of acute attacks in patients with HAE .

## GCP

All clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Orphan Medicinal Products

According to the conclusion of the COMP (2001) the prevalence of the condition is 2.1 per 10000 individuals in the EU and although a satisfactory method of treatment was already authorised within the EU, the recombinant character of the product was supposed to be of significant benefit. Therefore orphan designation was granted (11 th May 2001).

## Biopharmaceutics

No biopharmaceutic studies were conducted as recombinant human C1 inhibitor is to be administered intravenously.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetics

## METHODS

PK measurements included functional and antigenic C1INH levels. Functional C1INH was determined by chromogenic assay. Antigen levels of C1INH were determined by a nepholemetric immunoassay. The  plasma  levels  of  functional  C1INH  and  antigenic  C1INH  were  determined  in  a  sequence  of samples  to  evaluate  their  kinetics.  The  results  for  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  response  parameters  were derived  from  either  model-independent  (functional  C1INH,  C1INH  antigen)  or  model-dependent (functional C1INH) analyses.

- In a Phase I study (C1 1101-01), 12 subjects with HAE but without clear symptoms of disease at the time of the trial were intravenously infused with escalating dosages (6.25 to 100 U/kg) of rhC1INH on two occasions.

Treatment  was  rhC1INH  at  6.25,  12.5,  25,  50,  and  100  U/kg  dosages,  administered intravenously as a 15-min. infusion. Treatments were applied with a washout period of at least 3 weeks.

Blood samplings were collected 30 days, 14 days and 1 day prior to the start of the trial, at day 0, and at different time-points (15 and 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48, 96 and 144 hours) post-infusion.

- Pharmacokinetics of rhC1INH in Symptomatic Subjects with HAE were explored with phase II/III studies C1 1202-01 and C1 1203-01. Twelve subjects with 17 severe acute HAE attacks were treated with rhC1INH at 100 U/kg. Treatment  was  rhC1INH  at  a  dose  of  100  U/kg,  administered  intravenously  as  a  15-min. infusion.
- •
- Pharmacokinetics  of  rhC1INH  in  Healthy  Volunteers  (C1  1106-02) : fourteen subjects received in total 59 administrations of rhC1INH in a dosage of 100 U/kg.

Treatment was rhC1INH at 100 U/kg dosage, administered intravenously as a single infusion over a period of 15 min. For each subject five administrations were applied with a washout period between consecutive study drug infusions of approximately three weeks.

Blood sampling for immunological analysis were collected at screening, pre-dose, at 7 and 21 days after each administration as well as at the close out visit at 90 days after the last study drug administration.

## RESULTS

- In study (C1 1101-01), infusion of rhC1INH at escalated dosages resulted in dose-dependent increases  of  model-independent  functional  C1INH response parameters Cmax, Cmax above baseline, AUE above baseline, dose-normalized AUE, and of Time above 0.4 U/mL, whereas dose-normalized  Cmax  appeared  constant  (about  0.02  U/mL/U/kg).  The  profile  of  mean functional C1INH was similar to that of  mean antigenic C1INH. The profiles of functional C1INH showed a full initial recovery and a dose-dependent clearance of rhC1INH indicating a saturable mechanism of elimination. That rates of clearance, half-life and endogenous infusion were  dependent  of  dose  which  was  confirmed  with  a  standard  one-compartment  model  of analysis.  Application  of  the  standard  model  after  the  infusion  of  rhC1INH  at  100  U/kg revealed  a  clearance  for  functional  C1INH  of  about  13  mL/min,  a  half-life  of  about  3  h,  a volume of distribution of about 3 L and an endogenous infusion rate of about 2 U/min. After dosing  of  rhC1INH  at  100  U/kg,  the  Cmax  of  functional  C1INH  was  at  least  two-fold  the normal level for about 2 hours and remained above 0.4 U/mL for about 9 hours.
- In  Symptomatic  Subjects  with  HAE  after  treatment,  the  levels  of  functional  C1INH  and C1INH antigen peaked at median times of about 20 min and thereafter in about 8 to 12 hour gradually declined to endogenous levels.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- In Healthy Volunteers (C1 1106-02) after administration of rhC1INH the levels of functional C1INH peaked at median times of about 20-30 minutes and thereafter declined to endogenous levels in about 8 to 12 hours. T1/2, Clearance and Cmax were comparable to those estimated in the other studies.

## Model independent pharmacokinetics of functional C1 inhibitor (study C1 1101-01)

Time profiles of mean functional C1 inhibitor (U/mL) in the distinct dosage groups are shown in the figure below. The SD in the dose group 100 U/kg is represented by a bar.

Figure 1: Functional C1 inhibitor concentration (U/mL)

## Model-independent pharmacokinetics of antigenic C1 inhibitor

The figure 2 below shows the time profiles of mean antigenic C1 inhibitor (µg/mL) in the distinct dosage groups. The SD in the highest dosage group (100 U/kg) is represented by a bar.

Figure 2: C1 inhibitor antigen concentration ( μ g/mL)

<!-- image -->

Time profiles of mean antigenic and functional C1 inhibitor appear similar apart from the second peak, the nature of which is unknown, and whose magnitude seemed to increase with dose.

Overall,  following  infusion,  functional  C1INH  concentrations  increased  approximately  3-  to  4-fold and  declined  to  baseline  concentrations  over  the  subsequent  12  hours.  Median  baseline  levels  of functional C1INH appeared to be similar for each infusion and the dose-normalised Cmax was similar for all subjects-visit combinations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There appears to be dose-dependent increases of both Cmax (above baseline) and AUE above baseline of antigenic C1 inhibitor, whereas dose-normalised Cmax was constant (about 5 µg/mL/U/kg).

## Pharmacokinetic comparability

Comparability data between the formulation used in clinical trials and the to-be-marketed formulation was presented.

The pilot scale finished product was used in study C1 1101-01, whereas the commercial scale product was used in study C1 1106-02. In both studies, the dose was 100 U/kg. For study C1 1101-01 six HAE patients  were  administered  this  dose.  For  study  C1  1106-02  data  were  derived  from  the  first administration in fourteen healthy volunteers. Results are shown in the graph and table below.

In healthy volunteers (C1 1106-02; using commercial scale product) a higher Cmax was observed than for  the  Phase  I  study  carried  out  in  asymptomatic  HAE  patients  (C1  1101-01;  using  pilot-scale

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

product).  According  to  the  applicant,  this  difference  was  related  to  much  higher  C1INH  baseline values in the healthy volunteers compared to HAE patients group.

The applicant considered the 'pilot-scale' study drug and the 'commercial-scale' product pharmacokinetically comparable.

## Absorption

Rhucin is intended for intravenous administration.

## Distribution and elimination

RhC1INH demonstrated a volume of distribution of approximately 2.8 L, a dose-dependent clearance of  approximately  11.5ml/min  and  an  elimination  half-life  of  approximately  2  hours  The  plasma concentration  vs.  time  profiles  of  C1INH  showed  a  full  initial  recovery  and  a  dose-dependent clearance of rhC1INH indicating a saturable mechanism of elimination.

## Intra- and inter-variability

PK data obtained from study C1 1106-02 after intravenous infusion of rhC1INH in healthy volunteers revealed  that  the  profiles  obtained  at  three  different  visits  were  similar  and  that  therefore  intraindividual PK variability was low.

## Special populations

## Children

Studies in children were not performed and this was reflected in the SPC.

## Special Studies

No additional special studies were conducted.

## Drug interactions

No drug interaction studies were conducted (see section 'Discussion on Clinical Safety').

## Discussion on pharmacokinetics

Most of the PK data showing the anticipated range for this biological molecule but the recombinant product  shows  a  rapid  half-life/disappearance  from  the  circulation  of  the  patients  which  makes  a higher  dosing  necessary,  100  U/Kg  compared  to  usually  administered  15-30  U/Kg  with  a  plasma derived (pd) product (see figure in II.1.2) to cover a time period of 9 hours. This reduces the safety margin  with  respect  to  plasma  derived    products  and  could  boost  the  risk  for  thrombembolic complications as already seen with plasma derived products, when they are given in high doses for off-label  indications  where  the  underlying  mechanism  is  the  C1  inhibitors  involvement  also  in reducing fibrinolysis (See also  discussion on safety).

## Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

C1INH  inhibits  targets  in  the  complement  cascade  (C1r,  C1s  and  MASPs)  and  clotting  pathway (factor XI, factor XII and kallikrein). C1INH deficiency results in an inappropriate activation of these systems, in the release of vasoactive peptides (C2-kinin and bradykinin) and also in increased vascular permeability  which  causes  uncontrolled,  local  oedema.  Insufficient  control  of  C1INH  on  the (auto)activation  of  the  complement  component  1  (C1)  results  in  activation  and  consumption  of complement component 4 (C4) through cleavage of native C4 by activated C1. As a result, the levels of C4 in plasma of asymptomatic HAE subjects are about 20 % of normal. In these patients C4b/c, a cleavage product of C4, increases with decreased levels of functional C1INH.

RhC1INH displayed biological activity in asymptomatic subjects through an increase in C4 antigen and inhibition of C4 cleavage.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Primary pharmacology and relationship between plasma concentration and effect

PD measurements included levels of C4 antigen, determined by a nephelometric assay. Based on the measurements of functional and antigenic C1INH levels and levels of C4 antigen, PK/PD parameters were calculated using compartmental and/or other applicable methodology.

## METHODS

- In study C1 1101-01 12 asymptomatic subjects were treated and observed for C4 antigen and inhibition  of  C4  cleavage  as  well  as  for  plasma  levels  of  C4b/c,  a  cleavage  product  of  C4. Pharmacodynamics  endpoints  were  antigenic  C4  plasma  concentrations  and  magnitude  and duration of plasma C4 responses compared to pre-infusion levels.
- In Studies C1 1202-01 and C1 1203-01 pharmacodynamic endpoints were concentrations of  antigenic  C4,  C4b/c,  prekallikrein,  factor  XII  and  PAP  in  plasma  and  magnitude  and duration of plasma biomarker responses compared to pre-infusion levels.

## RESULTS

- In study C1 1101-01 12 baseline C4 levels and C4 responses were highly variable between patients  from  the  different  dose  groups.  Individual  C4  responses  were  expressed  relative  to individual  C4  antigen  values  at  baseline  (normalised  C4  antigen)  in  order  to  facilitate comparison  of  C4  responses  both  within  and  between  dose  groups.  Therefore,  the  mean  of individual  baseline  C4  levels  was  arbitrarily  set  at  100%  and  changes  of  C4  levels  postinfusion were expressed as % change from baseline.

The figure below shows the time profiles of mean normalised C4 antigen (%) in the distinct dosage groups.

Fig 4: C4 antigen normalised (%)

<!-- image -->

A dose-dependent response in C4 antigen was seen to peak at approximately 12 hours postinfusion and thereafter to gradually decrease to baseline.

Immediate dose-dependent decreases of C4b/c plasma levels were observed; this can serve as an objective quantitative variable and can be assessed as a good therapeutic response although C4b/c levels in the normal range (i.e. below 8 nmol/L) were only observed when the mean functional C1 inhibitor concentration was at least normal (around 1 U/ml).

The magnitude of the decrease in C4bc as well as its duration appeared dependent on the dose of  rhC1INH.  The  results  indicated  that  cleavage  of  C4  starts  occurring  once  functional  C1 inhibitor drops below a level of about 70% of normal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- In Studies C1 1202-01 and C1 1203-01 a single infusion of rhC1INH was followed by a sustained elevation of C4 antigen. The median C4 levels at screening and baseline are shown in the table below.

## Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances

No studies were performed.

## Genetic differences in PD response

No studies were performed.

## Clinical efficacy

Clinical efficacy was mainly evaluated in two open-label studies C1 1202-01 (phase II, single centre, conducted  in  The  Netherlands)  and  C1  1203-01  (phase  II/III,  multi-centre,  conducted  in  Hungary, Poland, Spain and the UK). Data from both studies were pooled, analysed together and presented as an interim report in the initial application. The dose of rhC1INH of 100 U/kg was chosen based on PK results.  A further two controlled clinical studies (study C1 1205-01 and study C1 1304-01) were in progress at the time of the evaluation.

The table  below summarises the total exposures per study as described by the Applicant, taking to account  that  data  from  Study  C1  1205-01  were  not  made  available,  whereas  data  from  an  interim analysis of Study C1 1304-01 were submitted at Day121 of the procedure and were evaluated.

## Dose response studies and main studies

The studies C1 1202-01 and C1 1203-01 explored the safety and tolerability, clinical effects, PK and PD of rhC1INH at 100 U/kg in acute attacks of angioedema. The two studies are by design almost identical, however, in study C1 1203-01 patients with laryngeal angioedema were also included.

## METHODS

The evaluation of efficacy was performed on the basis of the Intention to Treat (ITT) set, which was composed of all subjects to whom study medication was administered and for whom any follow-up efficacy data were available.

Efficacy data were evaluated for:

- -All eligible body sites, defined as body sites with an investigator score of 4 (severe symptoms) at 1h before start of study drug infusion.
- -The most severe body site of each attack (defined as the site with the highest investigator severity score at 1h before start of study drug infusion).
- -All body sites.

Patients were asked to score their perception of angioedema signs and symptoms by filling out two Visual Analogue Scales (VAS), one for treatment benefit and one for pain/swelling .

Analysis  of  efficacy  was  based  on  the  recording  of  angioedema  signs  by  the  investigator  (severity score) and by the patient (VAS scales). A series of efficacy evaluations was then calculated (time to the  beginning  of  relief  of  an  attack,  time  to  minimal  symptoms  and  relapses  after  the  beginning  of relief) and considered in an exploratory way.

Severity of angioedema signs were also rated by an investigator on a 6-point ordinal scale (depending

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

on whether the assessment occurred before or after infusion of the study drug).

## · Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary endpoints:

## Time to the beginning of relief

This was the primary efficacy variable in both studies.

## Time to the beginning of relief at a site

The following definitions for time to the beginning of relief were used in this analysis.

- Based on the investigator severity score: The first time-point at which a decrease of at least 1 point was observed compared to time 0 (start of infusion), provided that the next assessment also showed a decrease of at least 1 point;
- Based on the treatment benefit VAS: The first time-point at which the treatment benefit VAS reached a value of at least 20 mm, provided that the next assessment still had a value of at least 20 mm;
- Based on the pain/swelling VAS: The first time-point at which the pain/swelling VAS decreased by at  least  20  mm  compared to time 0, provided that the decrease was still at least 20 mm at the next assessment.

## Time to the beginning of relief of an attack

This was defined as the first-time relief observed for all sites (eligible or not) of the attack and was calculated based on the three definitions of time to the relief already described.

## Response

Response was defined as time to the beginning of relief at  a  site  within  4  hours.  Evaluations  were based  upon  the  three  definitions  of  time  to  the  beginning  of  relief  previously  described.    For  the definition  of  response  based  on  the  investigator  severity  score  and  the  definition  based  on  the treatment benefit VAS, all patients (100%) were considered to be responders.

## Relapse

Relapse was defined as follows:

- Based on investigator severity score: Reaching a value of at least that one at time 0 (start of infusion) at any time after the beginning of relief, but at 24 h-post-infusion at the latest;
- Based on treatment benefit VAS: Reaching a value below 20 mm at any time point after beginning of relief, but at 24 h-post-infusion at the latest;
-  Based  on  pain/swelling  VAS:  Reaching  at  least  the  value  at  time  0  at  any  time-point  after  the beginning of relief, but at 24 h-post-infusion at the latest.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary endpoints:

## Time to Minimal Symptoms

Time to minimal symptoms was defined as follows.

- -Based on investigator severity score: The first time-point at which a score of at most 1 is reached, provided the next assessment score is not higher than 1;
- -Based  on  treatment  benefit  VAS:  The  first  time-point  at  which  a  value  of  80  mm  or  more  is reached, provided that the value is still at least 80 mm at the next assessment
- -Based  on  the  pain/swelling  VAS:  The  first  time-point  at  which  a  value  of  20  mm  or  less  is reached, provided the value is still 20 mm or less at the next assessment.

## Time to minimal symptoms of an attack

The  time  to  minimal  symptoms  of  an  attack  was  defined  as  the  first  time-point  at  which  minimal symptoms were observed for all sites (eligible or not) of the attack and was calculated based on the three definitions of time to minimal symptoms above.

## Statistical and Analytical Plan

A first interim analysis was performed after 9 patients had been treated. A second first interim analysis was  performed  after  12  patients  had  been  treated  for  at  least  one  attack.  Results  from  the  second interim analysis are discussed below.

## Study Populations

The following three study populations were used for analysis:

1. The ITT population included all patients who received at least one infusion of rhC1INH and had any post-treatment efficacy data. This population was evaluated for efficacy.
2. The  safety  population  included  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one  infusion  of  rhC1INH  and contributed post-treatment safety data. This population was evaluated for safety.
3. The total population included all patients screened for the study. This population was evaluated for the baseline characteristics.

## RESULTS

- Patient Disposition

At the time of the second interim analysis, 14 patients were screened in Study C1 1202- 01, and 34 patients were screened in Study C1 1203-01.

12  patients  were  treated  (4  from  Study  C1  1202-01,  and  8  from  Study  C1  1203-01)  and  5  patients presented for a second attack (2 from Study C1 1202-01 and 3 from C1 1203-01), so that a total set of 17 attacks was available for the second interim analysis.

For 3 of the treated attacks no data were collected for the Day 90 visit. For all 17 attacks, all patients were evaluated 24 h and 48 h after the start of the rhC1INH infusion and on Days 7 and 22.

## · Demographics

The mean age for screened patients treated with rhC1INH in the study was 40 years and 34 years for those screened but who did not receive study medication.

The majority of subjects were female in both the screened and treated population and the screened but untreated group. For the screened and rhC1INH-treated population all subjects were Caucasian. 2 of the 36 patients screened but not treated with study medication were Asian.

## Time to the beginning of relief at all sites

The mean and median values for time to the beginning of relief were longest for the assessment based on the pain/swelling VAS for both beginning of relief at sites and beginning of relief of attacks (for all sites or for any site). The median time to the beginning of relief of an attack for any site, calculated for all attacks, was 30 minutes based on the investigator severity score, 15 minutes based on the treatment benefit VAS, and 60 minutes based on the pain/swelling VAS.

Patient assessment

3 For two body sites of subject 401 (study C1 1203-01), the time to the beginming of relief could notbedeterminedbecause the pain/swellingVASwas alreadybelow20mm at the startof the infusion (time 0) and hence could not decrease for at least 20 mm at further time-points

## Response

Based on the pain/swelling VAS, 1 patient (study C1 1203-01) was considered to be a non-responder, having a time to the beginning of relief of 12h.

## Relapse

No  patients  were  considered  to  have  relapsed  according  to  the  definitions  of  relapse  based  on  the investigator  severity  score  and  the  pain/swelling  VAS.  2  patients  were  considered  to  have  relapsed after  the  beginning  of  relief  (1  from  each  study)  according  to  the  definition  based  on  the  treatment benefit VAS. Based on changes in angioedema symptoms however, there were no clinical indications of relapse for either patient.

## Secondary endpoints:

## Time to minimal symptoms at a site

Based  on  the  investigator  severity  score,  the  time  to  minimal  symptoms  was  within  12  h  for approximately 69%, 71% and 77% of all subjects, respectively for all eligible sites, the most severe site of each attack and for all body sites.

Based on the treatment benefit VAS and the pain/swelling VAS, the time to minimal symptoms was within 12 h for approximately 75%, 76% and 77% of all subjects, respectively for all eligible sites, the most severe site of each attack and for all body sites.

## Time to minimal symptoms of an attack

The table below summarises the results for all attacks and for the first attack of each subject. The median time to minimal symptoms of an attack, calculated for all attacks, was approximately 240 to  360  minutes based on the investigator severity score, 600 to 720 minutes based on the treatment benefit VAS, and 480 minutes based on the pain/swelling VAS.

Investigator assessment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Investigator and Patient Assessments

Following infusion of rhC1INH, the mean severity score and the mean pain/swelling VAS promptly decreased  from  baseline  over  the  first  4  h  after  infusion  and  continued  to  decrease  over  the  48  h observation  time.  The  mean  treatment  benefit  VAS  rapidly  increased  over  the  first  4  h  after  the infusion and continued to gradually increase over the first 24 h after treatment.

## · Other Efficacy Analyses

## Investigator Severity Score

The mean investigator severity scores over time for all eligible body sites, for the most severe site of an attack, and for all body sites were presented. In general, the mean severity score decreased within the first 2 hours after study infusion and reached a score of 1 over 12 hours, and a level of 0 within 48 hours after study drug infusion.

## VAS Assessing Treatment Benefit

A total  of  7  subjects  (2  from  study  C1  1202-01  and  5  from  study  C1  1203-01)  reported  treatment benefit at time points before the start or at the start of study drug infusion. The applicant considered this  to  be  due  to  misinterpretation  by  the  patients  and  disregarded  these  attacks  from  its  analysis. Results  showed  an  increase  in  the  mean  treatment  benefit  VAS  after  study  drug  infusion  which stabilised at 16 hours following study drug infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Intensity VAS Scales

The pain/swelling VAS combines the VAS scale assessing pain for the abdominal sites with the VAS scale assessing swelling for the other body sites. Results showed an increase in the mean pain/swelling VAS after study drug infusion which stabilised at 16 hours following study drug infusion.

## Comparison of results in sub-population

No sub-populations were investigated in clinical studies.

## Analysis of clinical information relevant to dosing recommendation

Based on the PK and PD of functional C1INH in the Phase I study in asymptomatic HAE subjects, a dose  of  100  U/kg  was  used  in  the  ongoing  open-label  studies  as  well  as  in  the  Phase  III  placebocontrolled  studies  in  HAE  subjects  with  acute  attacks.  No  formal  statistical  meta-analysis  was performed and the choice of dose was based on empirical considerations.

## Persistence of Efficacy and/or Tolerance Effects

No patients were treated for long-term with rhC1INH, therefore there were no data on persistence of efficacy  over  time.  Treatment  of  acute  attacks  with  rhC1INH  was  considered  to  be  replacement therapy.

A very limited number of patients underwent second or third administration.

## Clinical studies in special populations

Clinical studies in special populations were not performed.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis)

Results from the main studies C1 1202-01 and C1 1203-01 were in fact submitted as pooled data with pooled analyses (see above).

## Additional clinical data provided during evaluation

## Study C1 1304-01

Study C1 1304-01 was performed in order to demonstrate the efficacy of rhC1INH at 100 U/kg in patients  with  HAE  with  attacks  of  angioedema  as  compared  to  placebo.  A  set  of  data  from  this randomised,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind,  multi-centre  study  was  submitted  at  day  121  of  the procedure as interim report.

## METHODS

Twenty-five patients, 13 in the Rhucin group and 12 in the placebo group, were evaluated in this study.

The primary variable was the 'time to the beginning of relief at eligible site(s) based on patients' VAS scores'.  The  secondary  variable  analysed  was  'time  to  minimal  symptoms  based  on  patients'  VAS scores'.

Two different analyses were performed:

- An ITT (full analysis set (FAS): n=28) analysis including all the documented patients,
- A modified ITT (FAS: n=25) analysis excluding three patients for which approval was still pending.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

At  day  120  of  the  procedure  the  CHMP  identified  a  number  of  major  objections  regarding  the evidence of efficacy; the applicant was asked to address the following points:

- The two pivotal studies initially submitted (C1 1101-01 and C1 1202-01) were open-label and uncontrolled,  despite  EMEA  advice  to  include  a  control  arm.  In  line  with  the  Protocol Assistance  recommendation,  the  applicant  was  asked  to  perform  a  comparator-controlled, randomized and blinded study in at least 20 symptomatic patients prior to authorization.
- Patients' assessment of treatment effect was based on a VAS which on occasions had been misinterpreted; the applicant was asked to comment on the reliability of this data.
- The  applicant  was  asked  to  provide  information  on  how  patients  suffering  from  laryngeal oedema attacks (the most serious manifestation of the disease) would respond to treatment.
- The applicant was asked to address the issue of inadequate experience of re-dosing.
- The  applicant  was  asked  to  comment  on  the  paucity  of  data  in  support  of  the  proposed posology. Specifically, the dosing recommendation, based on a Phase I study in asymptomatic HAE subjects, had not been adequately justified.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The majority (75%) of treated patients were female. It was uncertain whether response in males would have been the same at the recommended dose.
- From the description of the used study drug within the reports it remained unclear to which extent the 'pilot' study drug was clinically comparable to the future 'commercial' drug. The applicant  was  asked  to  comment  and  provide  a  respective  safety  and  efficacy  comparison taking into account both analytical and pre-clinical data.

The applicant submitted new data at day 121 of the procedure, addressing some of the above-listed concerns.

The following major objections remained unresolved:

- The  applicant  initiated  placebo-controlled,  randomised  trials;  however,  it  would  have  been more informative to see comparator-controlled, randomised trials and to explore the question of  superiority/non-inferiority  and  to  compare  the  safety  profiles  with  the  acknowledged existing therapies for the claimed indication (i.e. plasma-derived C1 inhibitor (pdC1INH)). Thus, the lack of an active control arm was not adequately justified and the evidence of benefit over placebo (and a comparison of safety to placebo) was considered not sufficient to establish a favourable benefit/risk.
- There were insufficient data to support the proposed posology and the dosing recommendation, based on a Phase I study in asymptomatic HAE subjects, was not adequately justified.

Because of the more rapid clearance compared to pdC1INH, Rhucin was evaluated at a higher dosage in order to ensure a duration of exposure above the minimum critical level of C1INH activity, 0.4 U/ml, for not less than 8 hours, and to minimize the potential for relapse and/or rescue treatment.

A  fixed  dose  of  100  U/kg  of  rhC1INH  corresponds  to  7000  U  for  a  person  of  70  kg bodyweight  which  is  much  higher  than  the  usual  doses  administered  for  a  plasma-derived product.  Rhucin  is  differently  glycosylated  and  has  a  shorter  half-life  and  probably  much higher  Cmax  values  are  reached  with  the  proposed  dose  of  100  U/kg  Rhucin  than  with pdC1INH.

Data  from  a  PK  comparison  between  Rhucin  and  plasma-derived  C1  inhibitor  would  have been useful.

- Laryngeal oedema is the most serious manifestation of the disease and there was not sufficient indication how such patients respond to the proposed treatment. Data were provided from the treatment  of  only  two  laryngeal  angioedema  attacks  treated  with  Rhucin.  Based  on  the successful  outcome  of  these  two  treatments,  according  to  the  applicant  there  were  no pathophysiological  or  pharmacological  grounds  to  consider  that  laryngeal  attacks  would respond differently or require a modification of dosage schedule to C1INH replacement with Rhucin or plasma derived C1INH products.

Moreover,  in both cases laryngeal angioedema  attacks were  treated with a dose of rhC1Inhibitor equivalent to 50 U/Kg bodyweight, rather than the proposed dose of 100 U/kg body weight, and this raised further doubts on the proposed fixed dosage.

Therefore, the company proposed to monitor in the Risk Management Plan the response from treatment with Rhucin in laryngeal attacks, and to submit documentation for review after each 100 treatments or yearly (whichever comes first) until 300 attacks will have been treated with Rhucin. Nevertheless, taking into account all the elements presently available, this remained a major concern.

- Overall and taking into account that hereditary angioedema is a chronic condition there was inadequate  experience  of  re-dosing.  The  phase  I  Study  C1  1101-01  and  the  two  phase  II studies C1 1202-01 and C1 1203-01 in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients evaluated 18 patients receiving 2 doses and 1 patient receiving 3 doses. In the open label extension to the placebo-controlled  randomised  clinical  trial  (C1  1205-01),  9  subjects  received  a  single,  1 subject received 2 and another subject received 4 open label Rhucin treatments, respectively. Because  of  the  double  blind  character  of  the  study  it  was  uncertain  whether  these  patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

received Rhucin prior to participation in the open label extension. Finally, in a phase I study with healthy volunteers (C1 1106-02), 1 subject received 2 doses and 11 subjects received 5 doses of Rhucin.

These limited data were not considered sufficient to exclude the potential for an unsatisfactory clinical safety or efficacy response after re-exposure to Rhucin.

- The majority (75%) of treated patients were female. It is uncertain whether response in males will be the same at the recommended dose.

In  the  phase  I  clinical  pharmacology  study  (C1  1101-01)  in  asymptomatic  HAE  patients,  4 (33%)  of  the  participating  12  subjects  were  female.  Although  the  numbers  were  small, according to the applicant the PK and PD findings were comparable between male and female patients and there was no evidence to suggest a gender difference in response to administration of Rhucin.

A majority of female patients volunteered to participate in the open label treatment studies (C1 1202-01 and C1 1203-01). Of the volunteer patients enrolled but not treated in the open-label studies with Rhucin, 21 (62%) were female and 13 were male. This gender difference was also seen in the treated patients, 10 females (71%) and 4 men (29%). No gender differences were found  with  respect  to  efficacy  or  safety  outcomes  in  the  open  label  treatment  studies. Additional  data  became  available  from  Study  C1  1304-01,  showing  no  demographic differences between the patients that received Rhucin compared to those that received placebo. Since in study 1304-01 there were no differences in demographic characteristics, the majority of treated patients being female in the open label clinical studies C1 1202-01 and C1 1203-01 was likely due to coincidence.

However, separate efficacy results for the groups of males or females, respectively, were not presented  because  of  concerns  over  lack  of  statistical  power  in  all  studies.  Therefore, differences in the treatment response in males and females could not be excluded. Furthermore, data on the concomitant use of androgens (which reduce the severity of acute

attacks when administered to HAE patients) were deemed necessary for assessment of efficacy results.

- During the CHMP meeting on 11 December 2007, outstanding issues were addressed by the applicant during an oral explanation before the CHMP.

The  CHMP  acknowledged  the  additional  clinical  results  and  took  them  into  consideration during the final discussion. The difficulty to conduct a study of non-inferiority against plasmaderived C1 inhibitor was also acknowledged. The proposed posology and dose recommendation was still  not  adequately justified.  Major efficacy concerns remained unsolved: the size of the clinical database is small (with re-administration data particularly limited in the case of a lifelong  disease  with  repeated  clinical  attacks)  and  does  not  provide  adequate  reassurance  in relation to efficacy in more severe forms of the disease, e.g. laryngeal oedema, and efficacy on re-administration.

## Clinical safety

## · Introduction

The initial safety data of Rhucin that were made available were derived from the four clinical studies C1  1101-01,  C1  1106-02,  C1  1202-01  and  C1  1203-01.  Results  from  these  studies  are  described below.

## · Patient Exposure

rhC1INH was administered 41 times to 24 patients: 24 administrations to 12 asymptomatic patients during  the  phase  I  study  in  asymptomatic  patients  and  17  administrations  to  12  patients  having  an acute attack of angioedema in the open label studies. In addition 100 U/kg rhC1INH was administered to 14 healthy volunteers on 59 occasions.

## · Adverse events

Only treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were considered in the analysis, i.e. those AEs that occurred at or after study drug administration up to the last visit at day 90 post-infusion. A separate analysis  was  performed  for  AEs  occurring  within  72  hours  of  study  drug  administration.  The  same analyses were done for serious AEs (SAEs).

All of the adverse events reported during the course of Study C1 1101-01 were graded as 'mild'' or 'moderate', except for 1 SAE which was considered unrelated to study drug administration but related to  pre-existent disease (HAE). Since a relationship with the study drug was not suspected this SAE was not reported to the Health Authorities.

The  AEs  occurred  on  single  occasions  or  intermittently  and  none  were  persistent.  Intermittent treatment-emergent AEs (n = 3) in most cases were considered to be related to pre-existent disorders (e.g back pain). All of the AEs occurring after study drug administration were classified as 'possible', 'unlikely' or 'definitely not' related to treatment. Of the 14 'possible' related AEs, 9 presented as headache, 2 as abdominal pain, 1 as a vasovagal reaction and 2 as local haematoma or skin reaction. 13 out of the 14 'possible' related AEs presented within 72 hour after study drug administration. None of the AEs were judged as being 'definite' or 'probable' related to study drug administration.

9 out of the 12 patients reported treatment emergent AEs, 1 from study C1 1202-01 and 8 patients from study C1 1203-01. The 1 subject from study C1 1202-01 at screening reported itching to occur as an  early  (prodromal)  symptom  before  HAE  attacks.  This  subject  reported  mild,  possibly  novel swelling behind the right ear after the 1 st treatment and mild itching urticaria behind the right ear and on the occipital region of the head after the second treatment. These events occurred within 30 minutes after  start  of  infusion  and  resolved  within  1  to  2  hours.  The  swelling  was  possibly  related  and  the itching definitely related. After the second treatment, the same subject reported mild headache after being awoken, which was considered definitely not related.

6  of  the  8  patients  with  AEs  in  study  C1  1203-01  reported  events  in  the  class  'infections  and infestations'.  2  further  subjects  reported  events  in  'gastrointestinal  disorders'.  The  patient  with  an SAE also experienced a partial muscle rupture at the right ankle. All AEs in study C1 1203-01 were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

regarded as unlikely or definitely not related to study medication and had resolved by the time of the interim analysis.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

No deaths were observed.

A female healthy volunteer was withdrawn from Study C1 1106-1 for an anaphylactic reaction, which was considered a related SAE and occurred during the first administration of rhC1INH at 100 U/kg.

1 SAE, 'unrelated' to drug treatment, was reported in Study C1 1101-01. Another SAE was reported in study C1 1203-01, which was also considered unlikely to be related to study drug. No AEs were reported that caused premature discontinuation of the study drug infusion.

## · Laboratory findings

For studies C1 1101-01 and C1 1106-02 none of the abnormal values for laboratory safety parameters were considered related to the administration of study medication.

Post-infusion, haematology values  outside  the  normal  range  were  found  occasionally  for  ESR, haemoglobin, haematocrit, RBC, MCV, MCHC, WBC, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils.

For 1 patient a relative high frequency of abnormal neutrophile values was measured on Day 22 postthe LLN and almost concomitant with the low values for neutrophils, several abnormal values were detected for lymphocytes on Day 22 post-infusion.

None  of  the  abnormalities  observed  for  haematology  parameters  after  treatment  were  considered clinically significant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Biochemistry parameters were measured at screening, 20 minutes before and 24 hours after infusion  and  on  Day  7  and  22  after  infusion.  Overall,  values  outside  the  normal  range  at  this  time points were found once or twice for sodium, potassium,  AST/SGOT,  ALT/SGPT,  alkaline phosphatase, albumin, total protein, LDH, uric acid and triglycerides. None of these values outside the normal  range,  which  were  measured  in  the  post-infusion  period,  was  considered  to  be  clinically significant.

## Urinanalysis

Urine samples were measured at screening, 20 minutes before and 24 hours, 7 days and 22 days after infusion. In all studies no clinically significant abnormalities were reported.

## Coagulation assays

APTT and PT were assessed at screening, 20 minutes before and 30 minutes, 1 hours, 2, 8, 12, and 24 hours  and  7  and  22  days  after  infusion.  In  all  studies  no  clinically  significant  abnormalities  were reported.

## Viral serology

Tests for hepatitis BsAg, hepatitis antibodies, and HIV 1 and 2 antibodies were performed at screening and on Day 7 and 22 after infusion. All tests were negative.

## Immunogenicity

As for  any  recombinant  product,  antibodies  may be  raised  against  recombinant  C1  inhibitor.  These antibodies  may  cross-react  with  plasma-derived  C1  inhibitor  which  would  render  treatment  with plasma-derived product ineffective. Also, Rhucin is derived from milk of transgenic rabbits and the removal and control of host related impurities (i.e. from the milk) is critical since very large doses of this  product  will  be  given  (typically  over  1000  mg  for  an  adult)  and  that  several  milk  proteins  are known to be immunogenic.

Anti-C1INH  antibody  subclasses  IgG,  IgA,  and  IgM  (tested  against  immobilized  plasma  derived C1INH and rhC1INH) and antibodies against rabbit milk protein (anti-Host Related Impurities) were evaluated. The analyses were performed at screening, 20 minutes before start of study drug infusion (baseline), at Day 7 and 22 post-infusion and at the Day 90 visit. Antibodies were determined by an ELISA validated for precision and specificity.

In Studies C1 1101-01, C1 1202-01 and C1 1203-01 no immune reactions against study medication were  reported.  1  subject  tested  positive  for  anti-C1INH  antibodies  subclass  IgM  at  screening.  At baseline and at the post-infusion time points, none of the subjects had positive results in any of the anti-C1INH assays or the anti-HRI test.

In Study C1 1106-02 an increase in the plasma level of anti-HRI (Host Related Impurities) antibodies was observed in 7 subjects following the fourth administration of rhC1INH. All assays for antiC1INH antibodies of IgM, IgG and IgA isotype remained negative. There were no clinical symptoms of an immunological reaction observed in any of the subjects.

Nevertheless,  during  early  clinical  trials  (37  patients  and  healthy  volunteers)  at  least  one  suspected immunogenic  reaction  has  been  noted.  In  a  study  in  healthy  volunteers  (C1  1106-02),  antibody responses were seen in 8 out of 10 subjects where the antibody levels rose above the cut off value of 120%  to  levels  of  responsiveness  between  128  and  564%  following  the  fourth  administration  of Rhucin. Also, given that the validation of the assay designed to detect patient antibodies to rabbit milk proteins  is  also  inadequate  (see  Quality  aspects),  this  results  in  a  lack  of  analytical  assurance  that patients  are  not  raising  antibodies  to  host  related  impurities.  Since  repeat  doses  are  expected throughout a patient's life, the available clinical safety database with respect to repeat administration in patients is insufficient to assess the immunogenicity of Rhucin at the present point in time.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Vital signs, physical finding and other observations related to safety

## Vital signs

In Studies C1 1101-01 and C1 1106-02 no clinically significant changes in any of the vital signs or physical findings were observed.

In Studies C1 1202-01 and C1 1203-01 systolic blood pressure and heart rate at post-baseline visits were in general lower than at the baseline visit.  The baseline visit occurred 20 minutes before the start of study drug infusion, i.e. while the subject was in an HAE attack.

## ECG

ECGs were recorded at screening, 20 minutes before start of study drug infusion, 24 hours and 7 days after infusion. Abnormal ECG results were reported for two subjects at screening and/or baseline and on  Day  7.  None  of  them  was  considered  to  be  clinically  significant.  At  24  hours  post-infusion  the ECGs were normal.

## · Safety in special populations

Not performed.

## · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Drug interactions were not considered (see 'Discussion on clinical safety' section).

## · Safety in Special Groups and Situations

## Intrinsic Factors

There was no reported bias of HAE incidence among different ethnic groups, and symptoms did not appear to correlate necessarily with the type of genetic defect responsible for the C1INH deficiency in HAE (in instances of the inherited condition).

No separate analysis was conducted for special populations. Patients younger than 16 or 18 years were excluded from enrolment in the three trials presented.

## Extrinsic Factors

Effect of extrinsic factors was not investigated.

## Use in Pregnancy and Lactation

No investigations specific to use of rhC1INH in pregnant or breastfeeding women were conducted and these  individuals  were  excluded  from  all  three  studies  performed.  Animal  studies  did  not  indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on embryonal / foetal development.

## Overdose

Doses  above  the  intended  therapeutic  dose  of  100  U/kg  bw  were  not  investigated.    No  case  of overdose was reported. C1INH after therapeutic administration in patients with HAE were similar to the  levels  of  functional  C1INH  that  were  reported  to  be  safe  in  the  clinical  studies  exploring  the potential of C1INH in various pathological conditions.

## Drug Abuse

Drug abuse was not investigated.

## Withdrawal and Rebound

Rebound and/or withdrawal following rhC1INH treatment was not investigated.

## Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Function

Treatment with rhC1INH did not have any effects on the ability to drive or to operate machinery and did not impair mental function in patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Additional clinical data provided during evaluation

A set of data from C1 1304-01 study was submitted at day 121 of the procedure as interim report.

All adverse reactions were of possible relationship, except for *(Definite) and **(Probable)

In  the  additional  Study  C1  1304-01  submitted  during  evaluation,  none  of  the  patients  (treated  with Rhucin or placebo) showed increased (above cut-off) pre-exposure values for anti-rabbit milk protein antibodies  or  for  anti-C1INH  antibodies  (against  either  plasma-derived  or  Rhucin)  of  IgM  or  IgA isotype. No increases of anti-rabbit milk antibodies or anti-C1INH antibodies of IgM or IgA isotype were  observed  after  treatment.  According  to  the  applicant  these  results  provided  no  evidence  for (primary) immune responses against host-related impurities or C1INH after treatment with Rhucin. Prior to treatment with Rhucin, two patients showed isolated slightly increased values (16%) for antipdC1INH  antibodies  of  IgG  isotype  only.  After  treatment  with  Rhucin,  increased  values  for  antiC1INH antibodies (against either plasma-derived or Rhucin) of IgG isotype were not observed. Following treatment with Rhucin, two patients showed isolated slightly increased values (17-20%) of anti-Rhucin  antibodies  of  IgG  isotype  only,  which  were  not  considered  to  represent  anti-C1INH antibody responses.

Still, given that the validation of the assay designed to detect patient antibodies to rabbit milk proteins was not deemed adequate (see above), the clinical evidence provided was not considered sufficiently reassuring and the concern with respect to immunogenicity of Rhucin remained.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Post marketing experience

No  post-marketing  experience  data  were  available,  as  the  product  had  not  yet  been  placed  on  the market in the European Union or in any other countries.

The applicant proposed to initiate a surveillance program after market approval, whereby patients were to be monitored for immunosafety at least twice every year (or once per year in case the frequency treatment is lower) at each treatment occasion.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

At day 120 of the procedure the CHMP came to the conclusion that evidence of safety for Rhucin was insufficient. Specifically, the following major objections were identified:

- In  the  absence  of  a  control  arm,  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  adverse  events  observed  was difficult to interpret. The applicant was asked to discuss this issue.
- Only a very small number of patients had been studied with limited re-exposure whereas the product is intended for a hereditary disease with repeated clinical attacks during their life. The Applicant was asked to discuss and provide justification for this deficiency.
- TEAEs had been reported in  75%  of  patients  of  whom  67%  were  of  hereditary  angioedema symptoms.  One  anaphylactic  reaction  had  been  reported  in  one  healthy  volunteer  and  an increase  of  anti-HRI  antibodies  in  7  subjects.  The  applicant  was  asked  to  better  define  the frequency  of  sensitisation  and  the  seriousness  of  the  potential  reactions  to  this  recombinant product or to rabbit impurities especially since these patients will receive repeated injections.
- Compared with published data of plasma-derived C1INH, the recombinant product showed a rapid  half-life/disappearance  from  the  circulation  of  the  patients  which  makes  higher  dosing necessary,  recommended  as  100  U/Kg.  This  could  boost  the  risk  for  thromboembolic complications  which  were  already  reported  with  very  high  doses  of  plasma-derived  C1INH. Therefore,  the  applicant  was  asked  to  explore  sufficiently  thrombogenicity  of  the  proposed treatment prior to marketing authorisation.

The applicant submitted new data at day 121 of the procedure, addressing some of the above-listed concerns.

The following major objections remained unresolved:

The risk of thromboembolic complications was not adequately addressed.

The applicant considered that there was no evidence to support a concern about thromboembolic risk arising from the proposed use of Rhucin in the treatment of acute angioedema attacks in HAE patients. In particular, there were significant differences between:

- the  patient  population  from  which  the  risk  was  reported,  severely  ill  neonates  treated  with pdC1INH, and the proposed 'healthy' HAE population that will be treated with Rhucin
- the administered dosage, 100 U/kg Rhucin in HAE  versus 500-1050 U/kg plasma derived C1INH in neonates
- the plasma clearance of Rhucin versus pdC1INH.

The  CHMP  objected  that  since  very  high  doses  of  C1INH  were  administered  with  Rhucin  the biological  effects  of  a  sudden  increase  of  C1  activity  in  plasma  from  subnormal  values  in  HAE patients below 0.4 U/ml to peaks of up to 5 U/ml (data from study C1 1202-01/1203-01) are unknown. Consequently,  resulting  effects  on  the  complex  system  of  coagulation  and  complement  activation could  not  be  reliably  anticipated.  Data  showing  similarly  high  Cmax  after  infusion  of  normally administered  doses  of  pdC1INH  were  requested  in  order  to  resolve  the  concern  of  a  potential thrombogenic risk through suspected high C1INH activities after administration of Rhucin but such data were not provided. Therefore, the thrombogenic risk would have to be addressed as part of the risk management plan.

In addition, the following concerns remained unresolved:

- The potential risk of immunogenicity had still not been adequately addressed in view of the potential  for  raising  antibodies  against  C1  inhibitor  and  against  host  related  impurities  (see above).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The  interaction  potential  of  Rhucin  with  concomitant  treatments  had  not  been  adequately discussed.

Following  the  Oral  explanation,  the  CHMP  considered  that  overall,  the  safety  database  submitted remains limited and it was insufficient to recommend a marketing authorisation for Rhucin.

The answers from the Applicant were only partially reassuring as far as the single dose of 100U/kg body weight was concerned. It remained unclear whether the safety profile would remain the same if higher or repeated doses of Rhucin are used.

Specifically  the  potential  of  immunogenicity  during  repeated  administration  has  been  insufficiently explored.

The risk of thrombogenicity remained a concern, and this was requested to be included in any case in the RMP as an important potential risk.

Interactions with other concomitant treatments could not completely be ruled out.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP considered that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  was  of  the  opinion  that  the proposed pharmacovigilance and risk minimisation activities were not sufficient to characterise or to reduce the risks to an acceptable level.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

Although, the  data  submitted  provide  substantial  reassurance  with  respect  to  the  quality  of  Rhucin, there are remaining issues related to the quality aspects of the product and their potential impact on efficacy  and  safety.  Rhucin  is  derived  from  milk  of  transgenic  rabbits  and  the  importance  of  the accuracy of measurement of host related impurities (i.e. from the milk) in final product is emphasised because at the moment, there is not sufficient reassurance with respect to the concentration and range of  proteins in the raw material, and thus the variability of the protein burden to be removed by the down  stream  process.  Following  review  of  the  data  submitted,  there  are  concerns  regarding  the characterisation of the active substance with respect to host related impurities (HRI), the inadequate control of HRI in the product and the use of a method (HRI-ELISA) which has not been adequately validated. Furthermore, the validation of an assay designed to detect patient antibodies to rabbit milk proteins is also inadequate.

In response  to these concerns, the applicant has provided  additional information  in an oral clarification. The additional information was promising but still requires thorough evaluation before it can  be  concluded  that  the  quality  of  this  product  is  acceptable  to  support  safe  and  effective  use  of Rhucin. In addition, there are a number of remaining concerns which would have to be addressed as part of post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the company.

As a consequence, the quality of the product is not controlled in a satisfactory way and the evidence provided was not sufficient to conclude that the manufacturing process and the methods of control will guarantee the uniform clinical performance of the product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

C1INH targets proteinases in the complement cascade and clotting pathway (factor XI, factor XII and kallikrein).  Since  C1  inhibitors  can  also  inhibit  serine  proteinases  like  plasmin  and  tissue-type plasminogen activator of the fibrinolytic system, induction of thrombogenicity may be an issue which should be evaluated in non-clinical safety studies for this type of product. Due to its PK profile Rhucin has  to  be  administered  in  relatively  high  doses  when  compared  to  plasma  derived  products.  The biological effects of a sudden increase of C1INH activity in plasma from subnormal values in patients with HAE below 0.4 U/ml to a peak up to 5 U/ml were not considered. Since the number of patients treated with Rhucin was small, a potential thromboembolic risk can not be excluded. A non-clinical study  investigating  comparative  thrombogenic  potential  of  Rhucin  with  the  human  plasma-derived product in order to investigate whether the intended clinical use of Rhucin does pose a thrombogenic risk was not performed.

## Efficacy

Two pivotal phase II open-label uncontrolled studies (C1 1202-01 and C1 1203-01) were performed in order to explore the safety and tolerability, clinical effects, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rhC1INH at 100 U/kg in symptomatic patients suffering from hereditary angioneurotic oedema (HAE). Overall, in the absence of a control arm, the clinical relevance of the effects observed was difficult to interpret.

To  address  this  point  the  company  submitted  on  day  121  of  the  procedure  an  interim  report  of  a confirmatory  placebo  controlled  clinical  trial  (C1  1304-01).    This  was  a  randomised,  placebocontrolled,  double-blind  study  of  recombinant  C1  inhibitor  for  the  treatment  of  acute  attacks  in patients  with  hereditary  angiodema.  Apart  from  some  residual  doubts  on  the  validity  of  the  Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) to assess efficacy due to their structure, there are no major methodological concerns with this study and there is evidence in support of efficacy relative to placebo. Nevertheless, the clinical database is small and does not provide adequate reassurance in relation to efficacy in more severe forms  of the disease, e.g. laryngeal  oedema.  Laryngeal  oedema  is  the most  serious manifestation  of  the  disease  and  therefore  it  is  these  patients  that  will  greatly  benefit  from  an appropriate treatment. According to the company's consideration, there are no pathophysiological or pharmacological grounds to consider that laryngeal attacks respond differently or require a modification  of  dosage  schedule  to  C1INH  replacement  therapy.  So  far,  only  two  successful treatments of laryngeal angioedema attacks with Rhucin have been reported. It is considered that this is too limited indication on how such patients might respond to the proposed treatment. Furthermore, the clinical data available does not provide adequate reassurance in relation to safety and efficacy on readministration,  since  the  database  for  repeat  administration  is  very  limited.  This  is  of  particular concern since the treatment of HAE and of angioedema attacks requires more than one administration and therefore further evidence is required to support repeated administration of Rhucin.

It  is  also  considered  that  the  data  to  support  the  proposed  posology  is  limited.  Compared  with published data on plasma-derived C1 inhibitor, the recombinant C1 inhibitor (Rhucin) shows a rapid half-life/disappearance from the circulation of the patients which makes higher dosing necessary, with a  proposed  fixed  dose  of  100  U/kg  of  Rhucin.  No  intraindividual  pharmacokinetic  comparison between Rhucin and a plasma-derived product has been performed. Rhucin is differently glycosylated, which explains a shorter half-life, but it has to be assumed, that much higher Cmax values are reached with  the  proposed  dose  of  100  U/kg  Rhucin  than  with  plasma-derived  C1  inhibitor.  Data  from  a pharmacokinetic comparison, even of a small exploratory study, would have been useful. Furthermore, it was noted that two patients with laryngeal attacks were successfully treated with a dose of Rhucin equivalent to 50 U/Kg bodyweight, rather than the proposed dose of 100 U/kg body weight. Overall it is considered that the optimum dose of Rhucin has not been sufficiently explored.

## Safety

Very high doses of C1 inhibitor are administered with Rhucin (see above). The biological effects of a sudden increase of C1 activity in plasma from subnormal values in HAE patients below 0.4 U/ml to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

peaks of up to 5 U/ml (data from study C1 1202-01/1203-01) are unknown. Consequently, resulting effects  on  the  complex  system  of  coagulation  and  complement  activation  can  not  be  reliably anticipated.  Therefore, the risk for thromboembolic complications which were already reported with very high doses of plasma-derived C1 inhibitor can not be excluded. Although there is currently no clinical evidence to suggest that there is thrombogenic risk with Rhucin, given the small clinical safety database available, the thrombogenic risk would have to be addressed as part of the risk management plan.

The major safety concern with Rhucin, however, is the potential for immunogenicity. First, as for any recombinant  product,  antibodies  may  be  raised  against  recombinant  C1  inhibitor.  These  antibodies may cross-react with plasma-derived C1 inhibitor which would render treatment with plasma-derived product  ineffective.  In  a  repeat-dose  study  in  healthy  volunteers  (C1  1106-02),  increases  of  IgM antibodies against  native  C1  inhibitor  and  against  recombinant  C1  inhibitor  were  measured  starting from the third administration of Rhucin and increasing with each further application. Although still remaining  below  the  assay's  cut-off  level,  this  is  a  signal  for  an  immunological  reaction.  Second, Rhucin  is  derived  from  milk  of  transgenic  rabbits  and  the  removal  and  control  of  host  related impurities (i.e. from the milk) is critical since very large doses of this product will be given (typically over 1000 mg for an adult) and that several milk proteins are known to be immunogenic. During early clinical trials (37 patients and healthy volunteers) at least one immunogenic reaction has been noted. In  a  study  in  healthy  volunteers  (C1  1106-02),  anti-Host  Related  Impurities  (anti-HRI)  antibody responses were seen in 8 out of 10 subjects where the antibody levels rose above the cut off value of 120%  to  levels  of  responsiveness  between  128  and  564%  following  the  fourth  administration  of Rhucin. Also, given that the validation of the assay designed to detect patient antibodies to rabbit milk proteins is also inadequate (see Quality), this results in a lack of analytical assurance that patients are not raising antibodies to host related impurities. Since repeat doses are expected throughout a patient's life,  the  available  clinical  safety  database  with  respect  to  repeat  administration  in  patients  is insufficient to assess the immunogenicity of Rhucin at the present point in time.

## Risk-benefit assessment

In conclusion, the CHMP considered that, following review of the data provided, there are concerns with  respect  to  the  risk-benefit  of  Rhucin  for  use  in  the  treatment  of  acute  attacks  of  oedema  in patients with hereditary angioedema for the following grounds:

- -The size of the clinical database is small and does not provide adequate reassurance in relation to
- i. efficacy in more severe forms of the disease, e.g. laryngeal oedema
- ii. safety and efficacy on readministration
- -There  is  insufficient  reassurance  on  immunogenicity  with  repeat  administration  in  patients, including its impact on safety and efficacy
- -The choice of dose has not been sufficiently justified
- -Sufficient  reassurance  on  quality  aspects  has  not  been  provided.  The  following  issues  are outstanding:
- i. It has not been adequately justified that the characterisation of active substance or product is sufficient  to  detect  and  identify  Host  Related  Impurities (HRI)  which could  be present in immunologically significant quantities
- ii. The validation of the HRI-ELISA has not been justified and it has not been justified that this test is capable of detecting quantitatively any HRI in the active substance which is present in  immunologically  significant  quantities  (i.e.  that  may  cause  antibody  responses  and related adverse events)
- iii. It has not been adequately justified that the quantity of host related impurities in the active substance  from  the  validation  batches,  as  detected  by  the  HRI-ELISA,  is  quantitatively accurate and within acceptable specifications

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- iv. It  has  not  been  adequately  justified  that  the  ELISA  to  detect  antibodies  to  HRI  raised  by patients is adequately validated to ensure detection of antibodies raised to relevant proteins
- v. Satisfactory  post-authorisation  commitments  to  address  other  outstanding  quality  issues would need to be agreed
3. -A satisfactory summary of product characteristics and risk management plan would need to be agreed.

Two CHMP members did not agree with the conclusions of the CHMP with the following divergent position:

- -Although  the  clinical  database  is  small,  Rhucin  has  been  used  in  the  most  severe  form  of hereditary angioedema, laryngeal oedema, and there is no evidence of lack of efficacy.
- -With regard to antigenicity, the antigenicity of protein medicinal compounds, and the clinical consequences  thereof,  are  never  known  at  the  time  of  licensing;  consequently  this  is  not  a reason to refuse the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for Rhucin.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by  a majority of 22 out of 24 votes that the risk-benefit balance of Rhucin in the treatment of acute attacks of oedema in patients with hereditary angioedema was unfavourable and therefore did not recommend the granting of the marketing authorisation.

## 3. RE-EXAMINATION OF THE CHMP OPINION

At the December 2008 CHMP meeting, the CHMP concluded that the risk-benefit balance of Rhucin in the treatment of acute attacks of oedema in patients with hereditary angioedema was unfavourable and therefore did not recommend the granting of the marketing authorisation.

On  8  February  2008,  the  applicant  submitted  the  detailed  grounds  for  the  re-examination  of  the grounds for refusal listed above.

## Ground for refusal 1:

The size of the clinical database is small and does not provide adequate reassurance in relation to

- i. efficacy in more severe forms of the disease, e.g. laryngeal oedema
- ii. safety and efficacy on readministration

## Applicant's position:

Pharming considers that the extent of the clinical database is reasonable taking into consideration the low prevalence of the orphan disease hereditary angioedema (HAE) as well as the low frequency of attacks that require replacement treatment with C1INH. HAE is extremely rare (1:100,000), and does not need chronic daily or even regular replacement treatment with C1INH.  Only acute angioedema attacks that are severe enough to affect the patient's daily activities qualify for the substitution of the deficient C1 esterase inhibitor (C1INH). The typical number of acute attacks that require replacement C1INH treatment is in the order of less than 1 attack per year per patient. Two plasma derived C1INH products are licensed in a limited number of countries (Berinert® P: Germany, Hungary, Austria and Cetor®: the Netherlands).  Rhucin is a recombinant form of C1INH with comparable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.

Several  clinical  studies  have  been  performed  with  Rhucin,  and  all  have  indicated  a  consistent  and satisfactory clinical effect.  Efficacy is clearly shown in findings from open label uncontrolled studies (C1 1202-01 and C1 1203-01) when compared to what has been reported in literature about the natural course of acute angioedema attacks.  Compelling and reassuring evidence is derived from the blinded placebo  controlled  randomized  study  (C1  1304-01),  where  a  highly  statistically  significant  and clinically relevant response to treatment of acute angioedema attacks with Rhucin was found. Positive

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment  effects  were  consistently  reported  both  by  the  patient  and  the  investigator.    More information from additional treatments of acute attacks with Rhucin have been and are continued to be collected  from  a  placebo  controlled  study  (C1  1205-01)  and  from  open  label  extensions  of  the  two placebo  controlled  randomized  studies  (C1  1205-01  and  C1  1304-01).    To  date,  clinical  efficacy, safety and  laboratory data are available to support  the benefit to risk  evaluation  from  189 administrations  of  Rhucin  to  96  healthy  subjects  or  patients.    At  the  time  of  the  CHMP's  negative opinion  (13  December  2007),  the  clinical  database  contained  163  administrations  of  Rhucin  to  89 healthy subjects or patients.  In light of the orphan nature of the disease, the fact that replacement of C1INH  to  treat  acute  angioedema  attacks  is  approved  in  a  number  of  EU-member  states  and  the evidence  of  efficacy  observed  in  clinical  studies,  the  company  considers  the  size  of  the  clinical database for Rhucin to be sufficient.

The clinical studies also provide evidence for the efficacy of Rhucin in more severe forms of HAE, e.g.  laryngeal  oedema.  HAE  is  characterised  by  the  occurrence  of  recurrent  acute  episodes  of peripheral subcutaneous and submucosal swellings ('angioedema attacks') of any part of the skin, and respiratory  and  gastro-intestinal  (GI)  tracts.  From  a  clinical  point  of  view,  abdominal  (GI)  and respiratory (laryngeal) submucosal attacks are considered more severe than peripheral attacks as they are associated in the case of abdominal attacks with severe pain similar to acute abdominal syndromes and may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, ascites and symptoms of hypovolemia, and in the case of laryngeal  attacks  may  lead  to  asphyxia  and  death.  Laryngeal  attacks  occur  in  less  than  1:125 angioedema attacks. In clinical studies with Rhucin sixty-two patients with submucosal angioedema attacks have been treated (abdominal 58; laryngeal 4).

HAE  is  a  genetic  disorder  characterized  by  an  inherited  deficiency  of  C1INH  activity.  The pathophysiological  mechanism  for  angioedema  attacks  is  the  same  for  the  different  peripheral  or submucosal attack localizations. This is confirmed by an analysis comparing the response to Rhucin treatment in non-abdominal (cutaneous peripheral) attacks with abdominal (submucosal) attacks.  The evidence for efficacy was highly comparable for the treatment with Rhucin of attacks at these different localizations.

Therefore,  there  is  adequate  and  reassuring  evidence  to  support  the  extrapolation  of  the  efficacy findings  to  laryngeal  attacks  from  the  open  label  and  blinded  clinical  studies  of  Rhucin  in  the treatment of other manifestations of both subcutaneous and submucosal attacks.

In  addition,  information  on  the  successful  treatment  with  Rhucin  of  4  acute  laryngeal  attacks  is presented  in  this  re-examination  submission.    All  4  cases  showed  a  rapid  and  consistent  relief  of symptoms as reported by both patients and investigators.

The  number  of  angioedema  attacks  that  require  C1INH  replacement  therapy  is  low.  Therefore,  the probability of patients having more than one attack to be treated in the course of a clinical study is small.  Despite  this  low  attack  frequency,  the  company  recognizes  that  data  on  re-administration  of Rhucin  are  needed.    During  the  clinical  development  program  information  has  been  obtained  on repeated administration of Rhucin to healthy volunteer subjects and HAE patients.  In total 22 patients and 1 healthy volunteer received two administrations of Rhucin, 2 patients received 3 administrations, 11 healthy volunteers received 5 administrations and one patient received 6 administrations.

No  safety  concerns  have  been  reported  from  studies  with  repeated  dosing  in  asymptomatic  HAE patients, healthy volunteer subjects and symptomatic HAE patients. In addition, efficacy findings after the  first,  second,  and  subsequent  treatments  have  been  compared, and no differences were found in patients' responses to Rhucin treatment.

To  date,  there  is  no  evidence,  from  the  currently  available  clinical  study  and  laboratory  testing database, to indicate that there is any immunogenicity concern that has impacted on efficacy and safet in HAE  patients  exposed  to  single  or  repeat  doses  of  Rhucin.    In  particular,  the available immunogenicity data after single and repeat administration of Rhucin in patients and healthy volunteer subjects support a positive benefit to risk evaluation for the use of Rhucin in the treatment of acute angioedema attacks.

Findings  from  the  clinical  studies  with  Rhucin  provide  evidence  for  a  clinically  relevant  benefit  of treatment of acute angioedema attacks with Rhucin.  In addition, Rhucin treatment appeared to be safe and well tolerated.

To provide more reassurance about the adequacy of the clinical database in particular with respect to severe  submucosal attacks, and the  number of repeat administrations it is  proposed to provide post marketing  safety  and  treatment  outcome  reports  to  the  CHMP,  first,  after  6  months  post-market introduction, and than every 100 treated patients or yearly whichever is earlier.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Therefore  the  company  requests  the  CHMP  for  a  scientific  consideration  for  a  positive  opinion  for Rhucin  under  the  provisions  of  Article  11  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  507/2006  for  a Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) for medicinal products for human use falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 with commitments as laid out in the Risk Management Plan.

## CHMP position:

The number of patients with HAE, treated with Rhucin for acute attacks is very limited. In total 163 Rhucin administrations in healthy volunteers and in HAE patients have been given.

In the limited number of patients treated in the placebo-controlled study, a better efficacy was found with single administrations of Rhucin (14 attacks) compared with placebo (14 attacks).

In  total  for  the  development  of  Rhucin,  13  patients  had  more  than  one  administration  of  Rhucin, whereof one received 3 and one subject received 6 administrations. Efficacy data is available for 12 patients. From these limited data it is not possible to perform an evaluation of efficacy over time.

Within the performed studies there was a restriction for administration of Rhucin, with at least 21 days between administrations.

No experience exists with the recommended dose, from repeated treatment within the same attack. Laryngeal symptoms were treated in only 4 individuals (2 until the oral hearing), whereof 3 received half the recommended dose, 50 U/kg, with sufficient effect.

A few patients have been described as potentially insufficient responders with both the recommended dose (100U/kg) and half the dose (50U/kg). In the ongoing open label studies there is an option to repeat the dose of 50U/kg within the same attack but thereafter not until 22 days later. In addition, in the open label phase of study C1 1304-01, 2100 U and a second dose of 2100 U or 4200 U can be used.

The safety database provided, does not allow any sufficient assessment of the risk for hypersensitivity/ allergic  reactions  or  for  reduced  efficacy  with  repeated  administrations  although  there  are  safety signals of concern emanating from administrations to healthy volunteers in the early development of the product (see Grounds for re-examination 2).

One case report of an anaphylactic reaction in a healthy volunteer is of concern. This reaction occurred 2 minutes  after the first administration of Rhucin.  From  the  case  narrative of this female, hypersensitivity against rabbit was revealed after the first dose. An increase in IgE was found in predose  blood  sample.  This  reaction  strengthens  the  already  included  contraindication  for  rabbit hypersensitivity,  but  also  shows  the  potential  risk  of  allergic  reactions  in  patients  with  unknown hypersensitivity towards rabbit.

## i. The size of the clinical database is small and does not provide adequate reassurance in relation to efficacy in more severe forms of the disease, e.g., laryngeal attacks

The following is based on data presented during the original assessment procedure. Experience from treatment  of  HAE  attacks  is  limited.  The  included  patients  presented  with  severe  symptoms  in accordance with inclusion criteria. Laryngeal symptoms were treated in only 2 patients, who received half the recommended dose, apparently with sufficient efficacy.

To extrapolate data on efficacy in laryngeal oedema from other submucosal manifestations of HAE might, as the applicant argues, be of additive value, but experience from other manifestations is too limited for Rhucin.

As the pharmacokinetic profile indicates a short half life, a high initial dose has been chosen during the development of Rhucin. However, there is not sufficient clinical experience from severe attacks with  the  recommended  dose  to  exclude  a  need  for  repeated  dose  within  the  same  life-threatening severe attack.

## ii. The size of the clinical database is small and does not provide adequate reassurance in relation to safety and efficacy on re-administration

Experience  from  re-administration  of  attacks  is  very  limited.  There  is  no  experience  from  readministration within the same attack. In total, only two patients have received more than 2 repeated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

administrations.  Due  to  restrictions  in  the  inclusion  criteria,  there  is  no  experience  from  readministration within 21 days from a treated attack.

Sufficient data are lacking to prove that the sought dose (14 times the recommended dose for plasma derived C1INH) studied and proposed 100 U/Kg (one dose per attack), is appropriate in patients with a need for life-long repeated administrations of C1INH.

There are insufficient safety and efficacy data to reassure that the signal from the healthy volunteer study is  of  no  concern.  These  findings  indicate  an  increased  antibody  development  with  increasing number of administrations.

## Conclusion

Thus, safety and efficacy in re-administration have not been sufficiently shown.

## Ground for refusal 2:

There is insufficient reassurance on immunogenicity with repeat administration in patients, including its impact on safety and efficacy

## Applicant's position:

Insufficient  reassurance  on  immunogenicity  with  repeat  administrations  in  patients,  including  its impact on safety and efficacy, is one of the grounds for refusal of Rhucin by the CHMP. Rhucin, as any therapeutic protein, potentially can elicit an immune response. This response can be directed to the protein  itself  (anti-rhC1INH  antibodies)  and/or  to  host  related  impurities  (anti-HRI  antibodies,  i.e. anti-rabbit milk proteins).

Impact of antibodies against C1INH: These antibodies potentially impact on the efficacy of Rhucin. To address impact of antibodies against C1INH on the efficacy of Rhucin, Pharming has undertaken the following studies: analysis of pharmacokinetics (PK) of C1INH  activity upon repeated administrations of Rhucin; evaluation of the formation of antibodies against C1INH following single and repeated Rhucin administrations; and analysis of clinical responses after repeated administrations of Rhucin.

PK  of  repeated  Rhucin  administrations  have  been  analyzed  in  11  healthy  volunteer  subjects  who received 5 doses of Rhucin at 100U/kg at 3 weekly intervals. No differences in PK profiles between the 1 st , 3 rd and 5 th administration were found. PK profiles were also determined in 7 HAE patients who received  repeated  administrations  of  Rhucin  for  subsequent  acute  angioedema  attacks.  In  these patients there was no difference between the PK profiles after the 1 st and 2 nd administration of Rhucin.

Immunogenicity  of  Rhucin  was  tested  in  82  HAE  patients  and  14  healthy  volunteer  subjects participating in the clinical development program of Rhucin. Blood samples were collected pre- and post-administration of Rhucin for up to 90 days. Validated tests for the detection of antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA) to recombinant and plasma derived C1INH have been developed. The cut-off levels for each of these tests were determined by testing blood plasma samples from normal healthy volunteers who never previously received Rhucin. Due to the nature of HAE, being a heterozygous disorder with patients still  expressing normal C1INH, patients are not naïve and immuno-tolerant C1INH. This is different from deficiencies like haemophilia A. Patients with haemophilia have no FVIII, are naive for FVIII administered, and are at risk to develop inhibitors to FVIII. In contrast patients with HAE are immuno-tolerant to C1INH similar to healthy volunteers. Testing a large number of plasma samples from healthy volunteers or HAE patients that had received Rhucin, for the presence of antibodies to C1INH, indicated that above cut-off levels of anti-C1INH occurred sporadically. Similar above cut-off level findings occurred in plasma samples of patients prior to the first administration of Rhucin and in post-treatment  plasma  samples  from  placebo  treated  subjects.  Therefore,  the  isolated  above  cut-off anti-C1INH antibody findings in subjects after the administration of Rhucin, often returning to below cut-off levels at later time-points, are regarded not to be clinically relevant.

Clinical efficacy  responses were  similar  in  12  HAE  patients  who  were  treated  with  repeat administrations of Rhucin for subsequent attacks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Impact  of  antibodies  against  HRI: These  antibodies  potentially  impact  on  the  safety  of  Rhucin. Pharming  has  evaluated  the  development  of  anti-HRI  antibodies  in  all  subjects  participating  in  the clinical development program for Rhucin.

In 11 healthy volunteer subjects, that were administered Rhucin on 5 subsequent occasions, above cutoff levels of anti-HRI antibodies were found in 8 subjects after the fourth Rhucin administration. The relevance  of  these  findings  is  doubtful  since  2  subjects  had  above  cut-off  levels  prior  to  the  first administration of Rhucin. In addition, no clinical safety concerns including allergic reactions occurred in these healthy volunteer subjects.

One female healthy volunteer  subject,  who  had  developed  an  anaphylactic  reaction  during  the  first administration  of  Rhucin,  retrospectively  appeared  to  have  a  history  of  multiple  clinically  relevant allergies including rabbit allergy, and was excluded from further participation. Rabbit allergy has been included in the SmPC as a contra-indication to receive Rhucin.

In HAE patients, there were no anti-HRI antibody findings above the arbitrary cut off level before or after a single dose administration of Rhucin.

Findings  from  the  anti-HRI  ELISA's  did  not  show  any  evidence  for  the  development  of  anti-HRI antibodies  after  repeat  administration  of  Rhucin,  except  for  one  finding  in  one  patient.  In  this particular patient, after the 5th administration of Rhucin, an isolated above cut-off value was found, without any report of adverse reactions.

The company has proposed and confirmed in a draft risk management plan to establish a prospective post-approval registry of the first 300 administrations of Rhucin. The company understands that this registry is accepted by the CHMP as a satisfactory means to monitor for the possible development of anti-C1INH  and  anti-HRI  antibodies  as  well  as  the  possible  clinical  consequences  for  efficacy  and safety, particularly, in their conclusions of the review of the company's responses to Day 180 List of Outstanding  Issues  questions  1D,  7,  12  and  16.  As  part  of  the  risk  management  post-marketing surveillance  program/  post-approval  registry,  blood  sampling  will  be  undertaken  to  test  for  the development  of  antibodies  to  HRI  and  C1INH.  Above  cut-off  findings  will  be  reviewed  by  an independent  data  monitoring  committee.  For  anti-HRI  antibodies,  there  will  be  further  laboratory testing  using  confirmatory  displacement  assays  for  specificity  with  rabbit  milk  and  a  range  of immunologically relevant  individual  milk  proteins.  For  anti-C1INH  antibodies  there  will  be  further laboratory testing to confirm the potential of these antibodies to adversely effect the activity of C1INH ('neutralizing antibodies').

## CHMP position:

In healthy volunteers receiving 5 administrations of Rhucin 100 U/kg, an IgM response was seen at 7 days after the 3rd, 4th and 5th administration. There was no increase in IgM antibody level in predose samples  before  these  administrations.  Thus,  as  the  IgM  response  would  have  taken  some  time  to develop after administration of Rhucin while rhC1INH is relatively rapidly cleared from plasma (t1/2 23  hours),  the  fact  that  there  was  no  increase  in  clearance  of  rhC1INH  after  the  3rd,  4th  and  5th administration cannot be regarded as proof that the antibodies formed are not neutralising or could not affect elimination in the long-tem.

Although  the  incidence  was  high,  and  eight  out  of  eleven  healthy  volunteers  developed  antibodies upon  repeated  administration  of  Rhucin,  it  is  agreed  that  the  clinical  consequences  most  likely  are limited as the reaction was mild, leading only to a moderate increase in anti-rhC1IN IgM levels and no persistent  IgG  response.  However,  data  currently  available  are  too  limited  to  confirm  a  similar immunogenic  profile  in  HAE  patients  and  support  that  C1  inhibitor  deficiency  by  either  lower inhibitor  levels  or  the  expression  of  a  dysfunctional  protein  will  not  confer  an  increased  risk  for development of an IgG response. In the study on healthy volunteers, the increase in anti-rhC1IN IgM levels was seen starting from the third administration, and so far, data is solely available on two HAEpatients receiving the third dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As the anti- rhC1IN antibodies appear to be cross-reactive, they may act to reduce the activity of the endogenous  protein.  Therefore  it  can  not  be  excluded  that  an  immune  reaction  could  increase  the frequency of more severe attacks.

## Ground for refusal 3:

The choice of dose has not been sufficiently justified

## Applicant's position:

The clinical development justification to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Rhucin administered at a dose  of  100  U/kg  to  treat  acute  angioedema  attacks  in  HAE  patients  was  based  on  the  following considerations.

## Clinical pharmacology

The  normal  physiological  state  in  healthy  subjects  supports  the  pharmacodynamic  assumption  that acute angioedema attacks cannot occur if endogenous C1INH activity is maintained above the lower limit of the normal range (0.7-1.3 U/ml plasma).

Pharmacology  findings  submitted  in  the  original  submission  indicate  that  Rhucin  has  a  different pharmacokinetic profile from that published and provided in the summary of product characteristics of plasma  derived  C1INH  products.  In  particular,  Rhucin  has  a  substantially  shorter  half  life.  This  is readily  explained  by  the  well  understood  differences  found  in  glycosylation  of  recombinant  DNA proteins compared to their endogenous counter parts.

As would be expected from the known differences in half life, the duration of these pharmacological effects of Rhucin are shorter. The observed duration of Rhucin's favourable effect on C4 consumption is dose dependent. The pharmacodynamic effect of Rhucin at 100 U/kg persists for at least four hours whereas that of 50 U/kg persists less than 2 hours. Most importantly, it is clear from the PK and PD data that to restore C4 homeostasis in HAE patients a C1INH activity level greater than 0.7 U/ml is required, that is, the lower limit of the normal range. Rhucin administered at doses of 50 and 100 U/kg was found from these data to achieve an activity level greater than 0.7 U/ml for more than 2 hours.

Finally, the Applicant selected 100 U/kg for the Rhucin clinical development program and 50 U/kg was rejected because this dose was not expected to maintain C1INH activity above 0.7 U/ml for more than 4 hours.

## Rhucin dose response

The  Company  considers  that  the  absence  of  a  thorough  dose  response  evaluation  to  determine  the optimal  effective  dose  of  Rhucin  for  use  in  the  treatment  of  acute  angioedema  attacks  needs  to  be placed in the context of:

-  the  many  examples  of  medicinal  products  with  regulatory  approval  where  the  optimal  dose  and dosage schedule has not been established

- the prevalence of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)

-  the  low  frequency  of  acute  angioedema  attacks  that  require  replacement  therapy  with  C1INH  are critical  and  justifiable  mitigating  factors  that  need  to  be  taken  into  consideration  to  determine  the acceptability  of  the  extent  of  the  Rhucin  clinical  database  currently  available  to  provide  adequate reassurance about efficacy and safety.

Because of the more rapid clearance, Rhucin was clinically evaluated at a higher dosage compared to current and historical clinical practice with pdC1INH. The company considers that the 100 U/kg dose has proven to be appropriate because there has been a favorable therapeutic response in all cases of replacement treatment with Rhucin in the reported open label and blinded studies (C1 1201-01, C1 1203-01 and C1 1304-01) and there have been no reported relapses or need for any other supportive care or rescue treatment.

It should be noted that there are no adverse event data to suggest that the differences found in the PK profile between Rhucin and pdC1INH raise any clinical safety or efficacy concern.

Recently results  of  placebo  controlled  double  blind  clinical  trials  on  the  efficacy  of  Cinryze™  and Berinert® P have been presented.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  In  the  clinical  study  for  Berinert®  P,  IMPACT,  two  doses  of  were  investigated,  10  U/kg  and  20 U/kg. The Applicant concludes that it can be assumed that a dosage of 20 U/kg of Berinert® P is the minimal effective dose for the treatment of acute HAE attacks.

- The dose used for Cinryze™ in the CHANGE study was 1000 U followed by another administration of 1000 U (1000 U + 1000 U). The results of the CHANGE trial (Relief within 4 hours: Cinryze™ 60%, placebo 42%) suggest that Cinryze™ at a dose of 1000 U + 1000 U (equal to 30 U/kg) may be an inadequate dose in the treatment of HAE attacks.

From the preliminary reports of these studies it has become apparent that there is no 'well established' agreement about the appropriate 'normal dose' of pdC1INH.

## Efficacy in support of Rhucin at a dose of 100 u/kg

The efficacy of Rhucin at 100 U/kg was evaluated in three clinical studies: C1 1202-01, C1 1203-01 and C1 1304-01. In addition, in the United States of America and Canada the efficacy of Rhucin is being evaluated in another placebo controlled randomized clinical trial with an open label treatment extension (study C1 1205-01). This is a study in which Rhucin at 50 U/kg and 100 U/kg is compared to  placebo.  The  Applicant  considers  that  these  preliminary  data  indicate  that  the  clinical  outcomes were less satisfactory compared to those obtained from studies with Rhucin 100 U/kg. In particular, there are several concerns,

-  Not  all  45  acute  angioedema  attacks  in  34  patients  treated  at  lower  dosages  in  the  open  label extensions of studies C1 1205-01 and C1 1304-01 responded to treatment.

-  In  study  C1  1205-01,  where  the  protocol  specified  and  permitted  (provisional)  second  dose  of Rhucin, 50 U/kg, was administered to three patients at the discretion of the investigator, these patients appeared to achieve minimal symptoms later compared to the patients who responded after a single dose of Rhucin.

- Four patients, in study C1 1205-01, did not respond to treatment, after Rhucin, 50 U/kg; two did not respond  after  a  single  dose  of  Rhucin,  50  U/Kg,  and  one  did  not  respond  after  Rhucin,  50  U/kg followed by the provisional second dose of Rhucin. For one patient, who reportedly did not respond to treatment, VAS data are presently unavailable.

- In study C1 1304-01, one patient received a provisional second and third dose of Rhucin (Total dose 6300 U), at the discretion of the investigator. Also this patient appeared to achieve minimal symptoms later (24 hours) compared to the patients who responded after a single dose of Rhucin.

The  company  concludes  that  taken  overall,  these  clinical  pharmacology,  efficacy  and  safety  data findings suggest that the most optimal and preferred dose of Rhucin for the treatment of acute severe angioedema attacks is 100 U/kg.

## CHMP position:

Based on the literature, a duration of at least four hours of C1INH activity above the lower limit of the normal  range  is  necessary  to  obtain  a  satisfactory  treatment  result,  e.g.  time  to  the  onset  of  relief within four hours in 100% of cases without relapse of the initial angioedema attack.

The results of the study C1 1205-01 are of great relevance for posology, since doses of 50 and 100 UI/kg are investigated for safety and efficacy in HAE patients.

In the study C1 1205-01, 31 open-label treatments with Rhucin for acute attacks of angioedema have been given to a total number of 20 patients. For 29 attacks in 19 patients data were available. For 26 attacks, patients responded to treatment with Rhucin for an acute attack of angioedema. In 23 of those 26 attacks, patients responded to treatment after a single dose of Rhucin, 50 U/kg.

Clinical  observation  data  are  available  from  four  acute  laryngeal  attacks  successfully  treated  with Rhucin in the open label phase of North American study protocol C1 1205-01. For three laryngeal attacks in four patients treated with Rhucin, 50U/kg, time to the beginning of relief occurred within 4 hours. One patient who had a laryngeal attack (patient 33-001), received an initial dose of Rhucin at 50  U/kg,  and  although  the  attack  had  responded  (time  to  the  beginning  of  relief  after  60  min),  the patient was administered the provisional second dose of Rhucin, 50 U/kg, 3 hours after the first dose, because at that time the patient still was not free of attack symptoms (total dose 100 U/kg). Time to minimal symptoms occurred after 214 minutes after the first administration of Rhucin.

The applicant concludes that these findings add more reassurance, at present, that the optimal dose of Rhucin for the treatment of acute severe angioedema attacks is 100 U/kg.

Furthermore, in study C1 1304-0, the posology informations are only expressed as a total administered dose, without any indications of patients weight. Noteworthy, 12 out of 14 patients received a single

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dose of 2100 U Rhucin, which appears to be efficacious and safe. If the SPC recommendation of a dosing of 100 U/kg has been followed, the 12 patients' weight would be around 21 kg, which seems unlikely for adults.

Moreover the higher doses required for Rhucin, compared to the doses of plasma-derived C1INH (1020 U/kg), could boost the risk for thromboembolic complications which were already reported in very high doses of plasma-derived C1INH. This risk has not been adequately addressed by the applicant.

Based on the data available to date, the CHMP considers that the choice of the dose recommended in the SPC is not fully justified.

## Ground for refusal 4:

Sufficient reassurance on quality aspects has not been provided. The following issues are outstanding:

- i. It  has  not  been  adequately  justified  that  the  characterisation  of  active  substance  or  product  is sufficient  to  detect  and  identify  Host  Related  Impurities  (HRI)  which  could  be  present  in immunologically significant quantities
- ii. The validation of the HRI-ELISA has not been justified and it has not been justified that this test is capable  of  detecting  quantitatively  any  HRI  in  the  active  substance  which  is  present  in immunologically significant quantities (i.e. that may cause antibody responses and related adverse events)
- iii. It  has  not  been  adequately  justified  that  the  quantity  of  host  related  impurities  in  the  active substance from the validation batches, as detected by the HRI-ELISA, is quantitatively accurate and within acceptable specifications
- iv. It has not been adequately justified that the ELISA to detect antibodies to HRI raised by patients is adequately validated to ensure detection of antibodies raised to relevant proteins
- v. Satisfactory  post-authorisation  commitments  to  address  other  outstanding  quality  issues  would need to be agreed

## Applicant's position:

i. In order to provide re-assurance with respect to the level of HRI in active substance, the Company has conducted further studies. Three analytical approaches have been applied to address the concerns of the CHMP:

- -First, a lab-scale purification run with non-transgenic rabbit milk was performed in order to assess the concern of co-migrating proteins in the region of rhC1INH on SDS-PAGE.
- -Second, the limit of detection of the immmunoblotting method has been confirmed in the presence of large amounts of rhC1INH.
- -Finally,  in  order  to  provide  re-assurance  with  respect  to  the  'true'  level  of  HRI  in  active substance, the Company has developed a strategy to assess the removal of 'model' rabbit proteins by the down stream process.

ii.  With  respect  to  the  proposed  HRI-ELISA and the lack of justification that this test is capable of detecting  quantitatively  any  HRI  in  the  active  substance  which  is  present  in  immunologically significant quantities (i.e. that may cause antibody responses and related adverse events), the applicant has  argued  that  as  with  all  recombinant  DNA  platforms,  the  impurities  do  not  consist  of  a  finite number of proteins that can be quantified but rather a theoretical range of contaminants that can only be present at very low concentrations. The strategy applied by the Company in controlling total HRI(s) is  in  accordance with Ph.Eur. and the HRI-ELISA is considered appropriate for the monitoring and consistent removal of HRI by the purification process. The Company acknowledges that the ELISA is not  intended  and  suitable  for  the  quantification  and  characterisation  of  individual  HRI(s)  in  active substance.  The  Company  will  address  the  immunological  significance  of  individual  HRI(s)  by implementation  of  confirmatory  testing  using  competitive  displacement  with  diluted  milk  and individual  milk  proteins.  In  the  circumstances  where  the  confirmatory  displacement  assays  identify specific immunogens, the Company will assess the responsiveness of the protein in the HRI-ELISA. If required, a specific ELISA will be developed and implemented at the level of active substance.

iii. With respect to the inadequate justification for the quantity of host related impurities in the active substance based on results from the validation batches, as detected by the HRI-ELISA, the Company indicated  that  this  concern  can  only  be  resolved  prospectively  by  the  proposed  specific  studies  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

extend  identification  of  possible  individual  impurities  in  active  substance  using  approaches  such  as immuno-affinity chromatography.

iv.  With respect to the inadequate justification for the use of the ELISA test to detect antibodies to HRI  raised  by  patients,  the  Company  clarified  that  the  current  anti-HRI  testing  strategy  to  detect possible antibodies raised by patients or healthy volunteers relies on a two-step approach: an anti-HRI ELISA and a confirmation assay intended to discriminate between specific and non-specific responses in the anti-HRI ELISA. The confirmatory assay has been validated and has been implemented into the standard testing approach for the detection of anti-HRI antibodies. Retrospectively, subject samples that  have  shown  responses  above  the  cut-off  level  of  the  anti-HRI  ELISA  are  presently  being subjected to the confirmatory displacement assay.

v.  The  applicant  have  provided  an  updated  list  of  post-authorisation  actions  to  address  outstanding quality issues and made the commitment to undertake these post-authorisation commitments to fulfil the conditions for approval of Rhucin on Quality grounds.

## CHMP position:

With their grounds for re-examination, the Company provided in writing data they presented at an oral clarification meeting held on 3 December 2007.

Regarding  the  presence  of  HRI  in  active  substance,  the  Company  has  applied  three  analytical approaches:

- -First, a lab-scale purification run with non-transgenic rabbit milk was performed in order to assess the concern of co-migrating proteins in the region of rhC1INH on SDS-PAGE.
- -Second, the limit of detection of the immunoblotting method has been confirmed in the presence of large amounts of rhC1INH.
- -Finally,  in  order  to  provide  re-assurance  with  respect  to  the  'true'  level  of  HRI  in  active substance, the Company has developed a strategy to assess the removal of 'model' rabbit proteins by the down stream process.

This  additional  characterisation  data  presented  together  with  the  post-approval  commitments  are considered satisfactory to assure that Host Related Protein (HRI) is limited to acceptably low levels.

To demonstrate that the proposed HRI-ELISA is capable of detecting quantitatively any HRI in the active substance which is present in immunologically significant quantities, the company has provided data to demonstrate that three model proteins can be determined by individual specific ELISAs. The new  data  provided  show  that  the  residual  quantities  of  the  three  model  proteins  are  very  low  or undetectable.  This  is  evidence  that  titration  curves  of  important  milk  proteins  are  similar  to  the titration curve of the standard (skimmed milk).

With respect to the inadequate justification for the use of the ELISA test to detect antibodies to HRI raised by patients, the company proposed a two-step strategy to assess specific immune response to individual milk proteins in treated patients:  an anti-HRI ELISA and a confirmation assay intended to discriminate  between  specific  and  non-specific  responses  in  the  anti-HRI  ELISA.  This  approach  is adequate  and  the  applicant's  commitment  to  develop  further  analytical  assays  to  control  identified immunogen and to include them as active substance batch release assays is acceptable.

In conclusion the quality related grounds for refusal are not maintained.

## Grounds for refusal 5:

A satisfactory summary of product characteristics and risk management plan would need to be agreed.

## Applicant's position:

An updated Summary of Product Characteristics was provided. In the  updated  version, appropriate changes have been made based on the comments made during the initial evaluation. QRD comments have  been  implemented  except  for  one  QRD  comment  which  was  not  considered  relevant  for  a parenteral product according to the relevant guideline on excipients in the labelling.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been adapted in accordance with the outcome of the initial evaluation  of  Rhucin.  This  revised  RMP  takes  into  account  all  previous  CHMP  comments  and includes the applicant's proposals for post authorisation commitments. In addition the RMP has been updated based on the clinical database available at 1 February 2008.

## CHMP position:

The  submitted  risk  management  plan  is  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on  risk  management systems for medicinal products.

In  the  RMP,  the  safety  specification  adequately  reflects  the  available  safety  data  based  on  the  very limited clinical experience and highlights the need for a post-authorization safety study, in the case of a MA approval. However, the applicant considers thrombo-embolic complications as a potential risk in  case  of  off-  label  use  at  very  high  dosages  of  rhC1INH.  Given  the  biological  plausibility,  this potential  risk  should  also  be  considered  for  indicated  dosages  and  should  be  followed  through  the ongoing studies and post-authorization safety study.

Given the limited extent of the safety database, there is a need to further assess the nature, frequency of identified and potential risks of the products as well as to identify risk factors.

In this respect, the results of the two ongoing randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials will be of particular interest.

Overall,  the  safety  specification  adequately  reflects  the  safety  information  obtained  from  the  very limited  clinical  safety  database  and  highlights  the  need  for  post-authorisation  safety  study.  Such  a study  needs  to  be  set  up  to  further  assess  the  nature,  frequency,  risks  factors  and  preventability  of allergic reactions and infusions reactions as well as important potential risks including development of anti-HRI antibodies and anti-rhC1INH-antibodies (IgM, Ig G and IgA isotypes) as well as thromboembolic complications.

The  applicant  proposes  to  set  up  a  post-marketing  registry  with  the  aim  to  follow  the  first  300 infusions  of  Rhucin.  A  detailed  synopsis  for  this  registry  was  lacking.  No  details  of  objectives, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, duration of follow-up have been provided.

As a consequence the proposed post-approval measure is not considered sufficiently documented and the RMP is not considered satisfactory.

## Views of the ad hoc expert group on Rhucin

For the evaluation of the grounds for re-examination, the CHMP decided to consult an ad hoc expert group for Rhucin consisting of:

-  experts  with  expertise  in  hereditary  angioedema  (HAE)  including  physicians  with  personal experience in the treatment of patients with HAE and

-  experts  with  specific  experience  about  immunological  consequences  of  the  administration  of recombinant DNA proteins to patients.

## The ad hoc expert group met on 10 March 2008.

The expert commented that currently available therapies consist of plasma-derived products, which, in clinical practice are given for treatment of serious, life-threatening attacks or when swelling is very painful and can affect blood flow. These severe attacks are not observed frequently.

Patients  are  reluctant  in  receiving  this  sort  of  treatments  due  to  their  concerns  about  possible transmission  of  pathogens  (e.g.  viruses  and  prions).  Delayed  treatment  may  be  fatal  in  case  of laryngeal oedema. C1 INH could also be useful in the lesser forms of attacks.

Patients  expect  the  best  treatment  they  can  tolerate.  For  some  patients,  tranexamic  acid  is  used  for years or danazol for male subjects. Short-term therapy using e.g. Rhucin would allow better control of attacks since the patient would worry less about taking the product (e.g. because of fear of infection with plasma-derived products).

Besides the indications given above, preventive treatment is recommended before surgery and before dental extractions. During pregnancy, the frequency and severity of attacks is often increased while the use of tranexamic acid or attenuated androgens is contraindicated; therefore one relies more easily on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

C1 INH infusions. Prophylaxis using C1 INH concentrates is essential for patients who are resistant to tranexamic acid and with contra-indications for danazol (androgen).

With respect to the grounds for re-examination the experts had the following views:

## 1. The size of the clinical database is small and does not provide adequate reassurance in relation to i. efficacy in more severe forms of the disease, e.g. laryngeal oedema

ii. safety and efficacy on readministration

It was acknowledged that the size of the clinical database is in fact limited; of special concern is the very limited number of patients treated for laryngeal attacks. Nevertheless, the experts agreed that the data provided demonstrated efficacy in less severe forms of attacks and could be extrapolated to the more severe forms of the condition (e.g. laryngeal oedema).

Extrapolation  of  efficacy  from  the  experience  of  treatment  of  less  severe  forms  to  the  laryngeal oedema attacks was considered acceptable based on the following argumentation. The pathophysiology  of  HAE  attacks  is  considered  to  be  the  same  regardless  of  the  attack  location. Laryngeal mucosa is expected to be the same as the other kinin targets, the difference being in terms of diffusion through blood vessels from the injection site. The data given at the expert meeting are in agreement  with  this  postulate.  The  severity  of  the  attacks  depends  on  their  location:  submucosal attacks (laryngeal and abdominal) are the most severe forms, although the extent of oedema in these forms is smaller. The extent of oedema plays a major role in the response to treatment; thus, one can assume that the smaller the extent of the oedema, the faster the response to treatment. Generally severe attacks involving laryngeal oedema respond faster to the therapy with plasma-derived products than attacks involving the gastrointestinal system or the skin.

Clinical experience with respect to re-administration with Rhucin is very limited so far. Nevertheless, the experts considered that there was no indication of loss of efficacy over time on re-administration. However, only 2 patients received more than 2 administrations. Furthermore, there was no evidence of an increase in side effects, and in this respect safety data are reassuring. However this would need to be  confirmed.  An  appropriate  follow-up  protocol  for  patients  treated  with  Rhucin  would  include measuring C1 INH function, C4 antigenic level, and the titration of anti-C1INH antibodies each year (see also below).

## 2.  There  is  insufficient  reassurance  on  immunogenicity  with  repeat  administration  in  patients, including its impact on safety and efficacy

The experts acknowledged that anti C1 INH antibodies development can also occur after treatment with plasma-derived C1 INH, in particular when treatment is frequent.

The experts reported a case with antibodies raised against plasma-derived C1 INH. The patient had an increased  frequency  of  attacks  and  need  for  treatment  and  had  urticaria.  This  was  an  exceptional occurrence. Although there was no strong evidence for the development of neutralising antibodies to C1-inhibitor  with  repeat  administration  of  Rhucin,  it  was  recognised  that  the  available  clinical  data were limited. Furthermore, the ELISA method used by the applicant may lead to underestimation of the  level  of  antibodies  since  antibodies  are  captured  by  the  high  excess  of  the  administered  target antigen, i.e. C1 INH.

It  was  considered  that  immunogenicity  should  be  further  investigated.  In  this  respect,  the  tests  on kinetics of the C1 INH activity in deficient patients which are treated repeatedly are very important and useful.

On the other hand, the possibility of anaphylactic and severe allergic reactions was viewed as a serious concern. During the clinical development of Rhucin one anaphylactic reaction was observed in one healthy volunteer; no such episodes were seen in any of the patients. Such a reaction in a patient with an  angioedema  attack  could  be  life-threatening.  Although  it  is  highly  likely  that  the  anaphylactic reaction in the healthy volunteer, who was a polysensitised atopic individual, was against rabbit milk

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

protein and due to her rabbit dander allergy (positive RAST), the exact nature of the allergen present in Rhucin that had triggered the reaction has not been further investigated whereas tests could have been  performed  using  the  serum.  In  this  respect,  it  was  noted  that  the  risk  of  IgE  response  in  the treated population had not been adequately addressed by the applicant.  Risk to patients with allergic reactions to animals and to milk proteins has to be considered since the trigger had not been identified and  cross-reactivity  is  possible  (in  particular  cross  reactivity  to  rabbit,  cat  and  rat  allergens).  The experts highlighted that about 8-15% of the general population, and probably of the HAE population, was atopic with a risk of developing IgE following repeated injections of any foreign protein.

The  experts  considered  that  it  was  unfortunate  that  the  applicant  did  not  take  the  opportunity  of obtaining a serum sample from the normal subject who had an anaphylactic reaction, most likely to a component of Rhucin, to elucidate the allergenicity of impurities. This could easily be done with IgE immunoblots on Rhucin. Not only the serum of this patient could be used, but also that of other rabbit and  cow's  milk  allergic  patients,  first  to  identify  the  responsible  allergens,  secondly  to  further elucidate  the  risk  of  anaphylaxis.  Such  studies  should  be  undertaken  as  soon  as  possible.  Also,  all participants for further studies, and all patients who might be treated with Rhucin, should be screened on RAST for IgE antibodies against rabbit dander, rabbit meat and cow's milk proteins. Alternatively, a RAST analogue could be developed to detect IgE against host derived impurities in Rhucin.

In  conclusion,  the  experts  considered  that  further  investigation  is  required  including  screening  of patients for possible allergies with monitoring of IgE responses before and after treatment.

## 3. The choice of dose has not been sufficiently justified

The experts observed that interpretation of the data was more difficult given that in some cases the dose was not expressed as U/Kg.

The experts agreed that the proposed dose (i.e. 100 U/Kg) was acceptable although it had been poorly justified (since it had been calculated based on badly documented weights of patients) and that a lower dose of 50 U/Kg may be equally efficacious although this has not been demonstrated on the basis of available  data.  The  experts  agreed  that  proper  dose  response  studies  in  a  condition  as  rare  as  HAE would be difficult to perform and therefore the strategy followed by the applicant to study the higher dose of 100 U/Kg first and subsequently investigating the efficacy of lower doses was thus considered an acceptable approach.

## Additional comment from the experts

The applicant confirmed that Rhucin is not intended for prophylactic use. The experts considered that the wording in the SPC 'replacement treatment' could be misleading. There should be no suggestion that Rhucin was indicated for prophylactic use and the indication should rather state only 'treatment'. It should be specified that it was for use in patients with HAE type 1 and type 2. It is not for treatment of type 3.

Therefore, the correct clinical diagnosis is important in this respect and although genetic tests are not easily available, low C4 and low C1 INH activity in-between attacks is sufficient proof to confirm the diagnosis.

## Overall conclusions on grounds for re-examination

## Quality issues

With their grounds for re-examination, the Company provided in writing data they presented at an oral clarification meeting held on 3 December 2007.

The  grounds  for  refusal  relating  to  product  purity,  validation  of  a  method  (HRI-ELISA  assay)  for batch release purposes and validation of the clinical assay for detection of human antibodies raised to rabbit milk proteins have been satisfactorily addressed by the Company.

Except  for  a  number  of  points,  which  will  have  to  be  addressed  as  part  of  post-authorisation commitments, the quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the  conditions  defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are sufficiently controlled. Viral safety or freedom from other adventitious agents (including TSE) has been adequately demonstrated. Batch to batch consistency has been documented and the relevant tests will be performed according to the agreed specifications.

## Clinical efficacy and safety issues

The  CHMP  agreed  with  the  ad  hoc  expert group  that there is insufficient reassurance on immunogenicity with repeat administration in patients, and that this should be further investigated. In the  clinical  studies  performed,  only  2  patients  received  more  than  2  repeated  administrations.  No individual received Rhucin within 3 weeks from the previous administration. Overall, the efficacy data made available from re-administrations were too limited and therefore the evaluation of efficacy over time  appeared  not  possible.  Moreover,  it  was  noted  that  Rhucin,  as  any  therapeutic  recombinant protein, can potentially elicit an immune response, which can have an impact on both anti C1 INH and anti-HRI antibodies development. In the repeat-dose study in healthy volunteers (Study C1 1106-02), there  was  a  trend  to  increasing  anti  C1INH  IgM  levels  with  increasing  number  of  administrations, starting  from  the  third  administration  of  Rhucin,  although  levels  remained  below  the  assay  cut-off. According to the last submitted listings of laboratory data, one patient in the open label extension of study C1 1205-01, who was the first to receive more than three doses of Rhucin, showed an increased anti-rhC1INH IgM level of 56% (cut-off level 50%) and an increased anti-rhC1INH IgG of 14% (cutoff  level  15%)  on  one  occasion.  No  conclusions  can  be  drawn  from  these  currently  available laboratory  data.  Since  repeated  doses  are  expected  throughout  a  patient's  life,  the  available  clinical safety  database  with  respect  to  repeat  administration  in  patients  was  deemed  to  be  insufficient  to assess the immunogenicity of the product.

In  addition,  the  safety  database  provided  did  not  permit  a  sufficient  assessment  of  the  risk  for hypersensitivity/allergic reactions. In fact, during the product's early development there were safety signals  of  concern  emanating  from  Rhucin  administration  to  healthy  volunteers.  One  anaphylactic reaction occurred in a healthy volunteer 2 minutes after Rhucin administration. IgE RAST and medical history indicated rabbit allergy. In this respect, it was considered that the risk of IgE response in the treated population had not been adequately addressed by the applicant. The CHMP agreed with the adhoc  expert  group  that  the  possibility  of  anaphylactic  and  severe  allergic  reactions  was  a  serious concern.

Overall, the clinical dataset was judged to be too limited to sufficiently show safety and efficacy of Rhucin in re-administration, and this remained a major objection. The CHMP concluded that further studies  in  patients  were  required  to  explore  an  immunogenic  potential  with  repeat  administration including  the  possibility  of  anaphylactic  and  severe  allergic  reactions  elicited  by  treatment  with Rhucin.

The CHMP took into account the ad hoc expert group's position that, based on the clinical experience with the plasma-derived C1INH, the efficacy data from the less severe forms of the disease could be extrapolated to the laryngeal oedema attacks.

With respect to the choice of the dose, the data provided indicated that a lower dose of 50 U/Kg may be equally efficacious, but this remained to be demonstrated. The CHMP agreed that extensive dosefinding studies in a condition as rare as HAE would be difficult to perform and agreed with the ad hoc expert group's conclusion on the acceptability of the dose recommended (i.e. 100 U/Kg), even if it was poorly justified.

Finally, the CHMP agreed with the ad hoc expert group that appropriate risk management activities (e.g. the need for a post-authorization safety study) would need to be put in place.

The safety specification included in the revised risk management plan reflected the available safety data which were based on the very limited clinical experience. The potential risk for thrombo-embolic complications  was  also  considered  in  the  revised  RMP,  both  in  case  of  off-  label  use  at  very  high dosages of C1INH  and  for the indicated dosages. This potential risk for thrombo-embolic complications  was  proposed  to  be  followed  through  the  ongoing  studies  and  the  proposed  postauthorisation safety observational study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Following  the  applicant's  initial  proposal  to  follow  up  the  300  first  infusions  of  Rhucin  in  a  postmarketing observational study and to set up a post-marketing registry, a synopsis for the observational study  C1  1407-01  was  submitted  within  the  revised  RMP  but  without  detailed  information  on  the proposed  registry  and  a  detailed  protocol.  Importantly,  a  rationale  for  the  proposed  sample  size (evaluation of data on 300 treatments in enrolling 600 patients) was not provided nor was there any information about the expected number of patient with repeated treatments. Although, during the oral explanation  the  applicant  additionally  informed  the  CHMP  about  the  possibility  to  use  an  already existing  EU-registry of HAE patients currently covering 11 EU Member States, the CHMP did not consider that enough information was available at this time to evaluate the adequacy of the proposed measures to collect missing data regarding the risk of immunogenicity with repeated treatment and of anaphylactic or severe allergic reactions.

In addition it was considered that the applicant did not investigate enough the anaphylactic reaction that occurred in the healthy volunteer in order to identify with certainty the responsible allergen. As a consequence the exact risk factors for potential anaphylactic or severe allergic reaction have not been fully  characterised  and,  with  the  data  currently  available,  the  adequacy  of  the  risk  management proposed cannot be evaluated.

The CHMP considered that because the safety profile has not been sufficiently elucidated, it is not possible at this time to evaluate the adequacy of the risk management plan.

## Overall conclusions on grounds for re-examination

In  conclusion,  the  CHMP  considered  that,  following  re-examination  of  the  data  provided, major concerns remained with respect to the safety and efficacy of Rhucin and that the riskbenefit balance of Rhucin was unfavourable.

Three CHMP members did not agree with the conclusions of the CHMP with the following divergent position:

- -The antigenicity and allerginicity of protein medicinal compounds, and the clinical consequences thereof, are never known at the time of licensing; consequently this is not a reason to refuse the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for Rhucin.

With  the  re-examination,  the  CHMP  considered  whether  the  application  for  Rhucin  met  the requirements  for  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation  as  proposed  by  the  applicant.  The  CHMP concluded that Rhucin did not meet the requirements for a conditional marketing authorisation since the risk-benefit balance of the product was not positive.

## GROUNDS FOR REFUSAL

Whereas

- -The size of the clinical database is considered too small to provide adequate reassurance on efficacy and safety, including immunogenicity with repeat administration in patients (and its impact), and serious concerns with respect to the occurrence of anaphylactic and severe allergic reactions with Rhucin.

the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Rhucin  in  the  treatment  of  acute  attacks  of  oedema  in  patients  with hereditary angioedema cannot be considered positive, and therefore the CHMP has recommended the refusal of the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for Rhucin.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by  a majority of 27 out of 30 votes that the risk-benefit balance of Rhucin in the treatment of acute attacks of oedema in patients with hereditary angioedema was unfavourable and therefore did not recommend the granting of the marketing authorisation.
