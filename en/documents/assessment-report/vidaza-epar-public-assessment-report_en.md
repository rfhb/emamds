## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome) is a rare and life threatening disease that can affect children and adults, although the highest prevalence occurs in those over 60 years of age.(1) The incidence of MDS has been estimated as 4.1/100,000 population. The incidence rises with increasing age: 4.9 for people aged 50 to 70 years and 22.8 for people older than 70 years.(1)

MDS encompasses a group of haematological disorders that is characterised by clonal haematopoietic stem  cell  disorder,  usually  of  the  granulocytic,  erythroid  or  platelet  lineage,  that  results  in abnormalities in proliferation, differentiation and maturation of the myeloid lineage.(2)  This leads to one  or  more  peripheral  cytopenias  and  progressive  bone  marrow  failure.  As  a  result,  patients  with MDS are at risk for symptomatic anaemia, infection and bleeding.(3)

The  clinical  presentation  of  MDS  is  generally  non-specific.  However,  initial  findings  of  MDS  can usually  be  attributed  to  the  underlying  cytopenias.  MDS  can  arise de  novo (primary  MDS)  or following  treatment  with  chemotherapy,  radiation  therapy  or  chemical  injury  (secondary  MDS). Depending on the subtype of myelodysplasia, there is a risk of approximately 50% for development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is often refractory to standard treatment.

The  diagnosis  and  classification  of  MDS  can  be  based  on  two  classification  systems,  the  FrenchAmerican-British (FAB) classification system and the more recent updated WHO classification system (4) (table 1).

The International Prognostic Scoring System issued in 1997 provides a method for evaluating clinical prognostic risk factors for patients with MDS (5). The 3 critical factors include risk-based cytogenetic subgroups (good, intermediate, and poor), bone marrow blast percentage and cytopenias. Patients are grouped into 4 risk categories based on total scores from these prognostic factors (table 2) (1, 3).

Total Score Value is determined based on the combination of individual score of bone marrow blasts, karyotype and cytopenia

Despite  current  treatment  strategies,  approximately  half  of  the  patient  population  with  MDS  dies within 4 years. Cure may be achieved only in patients who can receive allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell  transplantation  (allo  HSCT)  (5).  However,  depending  on  a  patient's  age  and  general  health condition,  best  supportive  care  (BSC),  consisting  in  transfusions,  growth  factors,  iron  chelation therapy,  is  most  frequently  applied.  Otherwise,  low-dose  chemotherapy  or  standard  combination chemotherapy may be used for the various subclasses of MDS but without a standard approach of care (6). Only intensive chemotherapy followed by allo HSCT was shown to result in improved survival in patients with Intermediate-2 or high risk MDS or AML that progressed from MDS (AML-MDS) when compared with non-intensive treatment or supportive care only (actuarial survival at 4 years of 26% vs. 10%)(7, 8).

AML evolving  from  MDS  is  often  less  responsive  to  standard  treatment  than de  novo AML.  The usually higher age at diagnosis makes these patients more vulnerable to toxic effects from induction and consolidation chemotherapy (with e.g., cytarabine, etoposide and idarubicin) and the HSCT.

Vidaza,  5-azacitidine  (azacitidine  or  5-aza)  is  a  pyrimidine  nucleoside  analogue  of  cytidine,  a constituent  of  RNA.  Due  to  its  similarity  to  cytidine,  azacitidine  blocks  the  synthesis  of  DNA  and RNA and thus inhibits the growth of tumour cells. Metabolites such as azacitidine are also associated with inhibition of DNA-methylation (hypomethylation) and can inhibit tumour growth (9). High-risk MDS  shows  a  high  prevalence  of  tumour  suppressor  gene  hypermethylation,  which  induces inactivation of tumour suppressor genes. By re-establishing cell cycle control by restoring suppressor gene  function  and  antiproliferative  signals,  this  could  contribute  to  re-establish  cell  differentiation pathways required for appropriate cellular function.

The  marketing  authorisation  application  for  Vidaza  was  for  the  following  indication:  'Vidaza  is indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  who  are  not  eligible  for  haematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation with:

-  intermediate-2 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS),
-  chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML)  with 10-29 %  marrow blasts without myeloproliferative disorder,
-  acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with 20-30 % blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to World Health Organisation (WHO) classification.'

The  recommended  dose  is  75  mg/m 2 s.c.  once  daily  for  7  days  every  28  days.  The  drug  can  be administered in an outpatient setting and is considered to be a low intensity form of therapy.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Vidaza is presented as a sterile, single use powder for suspension for injection containing 100 mg of azacitidine. It must be reconstituted with water for injections before subcutaneous injection.

The other ingredients include mannitol.

The finished product is packed in glass vials closed by a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminium seal with a plastic button.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Active Substance

The active substance is azacitidine, a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue of cytidine.

It is a white to off-white solid, sparingly soluble in water. Azacitidine contains 4 chiral centres but it is synthesised as a single enantiomer. It is not hygroscopic but it hydrolyses quickly in water (reaction pH  and  temperature  dependent).  9  solid-state  forms  have  been  identified:  five  polymorphic  forms, three  pseudopolymorphic  forms  and  an  amorphous  form.  Even  if  the  active  substance  is  fully solubilised during manufacture of the finished product, polymorphism could be of importance since the speed of dissolution of azacitidine could affect its degradation. However, all the polymorphs have been shown to convert quickly a single bioavailable pseudopolymorphic form in presence of water via rapid  surface  hydration  and  therefore  in  this  case  the  physical  form  of  the  active  substance  is  not expected to impact either on the stability or on the performance of the finished product.

##  Manufacture

The  manufacture  of  azacitidine  comprises  4  main  steps.  All  manufacturing  steps  have  been  well described.

The finalised specifications for starting material 5-azacytosine are considered to be adequate.  There are  no  intermediates  isolated  in  purified  form  in  the  manufacturing  process.  There  are  few  process related impurities, monoacetyl azacitidine is detectable in the active substance.

-  Specification

The active substance specification include tests for colour, appearance, identity (IR), optical rotation (PhEur),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  sulphated  ash  (PhEur),  heavy metals (PhEur), water content (PhEur), microbial limits (PhEur) and bacterial endotoxins (PhEur).

Satisfactory batch analysis data have been provided to confirm compliance and uniformity with the proposed specification.

Impurity levels have been qualified by relevant toxicological studies.

-  Stability

Stability data have been provided for 5 batches at accelerated conditions (25±2°C/60% RH) and longterm  conditions  (5±3°)  respectively.  6-month  and  4-year  data  have  been  provided.  The  parameters tested  included  colour,  appearance,  assay,  related  substances,  water  content  and  microbial  limits testing.  Analytical  methods  used  in  stability  testing  include  water  content  (PhEur),  microbial  limits (PhEur.), assay (HPLC) and related substances (HPLC). An evaluation of polymorphic stability was also performed on active substance through 48 months under long-term storage conditions and through 6 months under accelerated storage conditions. The data demonstrated that no changes in polymorphic form were observed under any of the conditions studied for the duration of the evaluation

The  applicant  claims  a  re-test  period  of  3  years,  if  stored  in  double  polyethylene  bags  secured  in HDPE kegs at 2-8°C. No significant changes have been observed among the available stability results; no signs of degradation have been noticed. The claimed re-test period can be accepted.

-  Pharmaceutical development

The proposed medicinal product is a powder for suspension for injection, a sterile,  single-use  drug formulation  containing  100  mg  azacitidine  intended  for  reconstitution  with  4  ml  sterile  water  for injection to form a suspension prior to subcutaneous injection.

Azacitidine rapidly degrades in aqueous solution via hydrolysis. Due to this instability, an aqueous formulation  was  not  a  viable  option.  Thus,  a  lyophilized  dosage  form  was  developed  to  minimize water activity in the medicinal product.

Mannitol,  used  as  a  bulking  agent  for  the  lyophilisation  process,  is  the  only  excipient  in  the formulation.  It  is  of  PhEur  quality  and  its  compatibility  with  azacitidine  has  been  confirmed  by development and long-term stability studies. There is no need to buffer the formulation as the active is not a salt and it remains uncharged at the pH of the sterile water for injections used to reconstitute the product.  Regarding the TSE risk, the medicinal product does not include any components of ruminant origin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To minimize azacitidine  degradation  during  product  manufacturing,  the  manufacturing  process  was developed  such  that  compounding,  filtration  and  filling  operations  are  performed  as  a  continuous process at reduced temperatures.

The type I glass vials and the siliconized rubber stopper used as primary packaging material meet the PhEur requirements. They are compatible with the product and capable to protect it from excessive moisture in relation to the proposed specification. Acceptable closure integrity studies (dye penetration and microbial challenge studies) have been performed.

##  Manufacture of the Product

There are two manufacturers.

The manufacturing process involves the following operations: compounding, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, lyophilisation and packaging. A manufacturing overage for azacitidine was included to account for an observed loss of the compound during filtration.

Due to the instability  of  azacitidine  in  aqueous  solution,  control  of  product  temperature  throughout compounding, filtration, and filling and holding time are considered critical in order to minimize drug degradation.

The rapid freeze-drying applied leads to the formation of different polymorphs in the finished product. However, this has been found acceptable as it does not impact significantly either on the stability or on the performance of the finished product (see active substance). Satisfactory operating parameters and in-process controls have been defined at each stage of manufacture. The maximum holding time has been adequately justified based on azacitidine degradation data and microbiological data. Furthermore, manufacturing at reduced temperatures minimizes the risk of increasing bioburden over the short time interval.

Satisfactory validation data have been provided.

-  Product specification

The finished product specification includes tests for colour, appearance, foreign matter, identity (Ph Eur), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), water content (PhEur), sterility (PhEur), bacterial endotoxins (PhEur) and colour and appearance of the reconstituted product.

Batch analysis data provided comply with the specifications and indicate consistent and reproducible manufacture.

-  Stability of the product

## Stability of the Product before reconstitution

Three  batches  of  lyophilized  powder  from  each  of  the  manufacturers  have  been  stored  for  up  to  4 years (depending upon the manufacturing site), 1 year at 25°C/60% RH and 30°C/65% RH and for 6 months at 40°C/75% RH.

All of the testing results are well within specification for product stored under both accelerated and long-term  storage  conditions.  The  results  presented  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  and  storage conditions defined in the SPC for the finished product before and after reconstitution.

## In-use stability of the reconstituted solution

The chemical and physical in-use stability of the reconstituted medicinal product of NMT 45 min at 25°C and NMT 8 hours at 2-8°C is accepted.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The  active  substance  is  well  characterised  and  documented.  The  pharmaceutical  form  selected  is adequate taken into account the properties and the stability of the active substance. The excipient is commonly  used  for  this  kind  of  formulation  and  the  packaging  material  is  well  documented.  The manufacturing  process  obtains  reproducible  finished  product  batches.  Stability  tests  under  ICH conditions indicate that the product is stable for the proposed shelf life.

At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion  there  were  some  minor  unresolved  quality  issues  which  had  no impact on the benefit/risk profile.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

The non-clinical data are based on bibliographical information, applicant-sponsored studies and NCIsponsored studies. Most of the non-clinical studies were conducted in the 1960s and 1970s before the introduction  of  Good  Laboratory  Practice  (GLP)  regulations  and  International  Conference  on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines.

## Pharmacology

-  Primary pharmacodynamics

As a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue designed to incorporate into RNA and DNA instead of cytidine, azacitidine has a broad spectrum of anti-metabolic effects. The primary pharmacodynamic effects of interest in the treatment of MDS are:

- -inhibition of DNA methylation.

-cytotoxicity  by  incorporation  of  azacitidine  into  DNA  and  RNA  and  inhibition  of  protein synthesis.

The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis (10).

-  Secondary pharmacodynamics

No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted.

-  Safety pharmacology programme

No safety pharmacology studies have been submitted.

-  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been submitted.

## Pharmacokinetics

Most of the  non-clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  of  azacitidine  were  conducted  in  the  1960s  using non-specific analytical methods available at that time. Through a programme designed to assess the oral  (p.o.)  route,  recent  pharmacokinetic  data  have  been  generated  in  2  animal  models:  in  mice, following radiolabelled azacitidine administered p.o and i.v. and in dogs treated with i.v., s.c. and p.o. azacitidine.

-  Analytical methods

The  concentration  of  azacitidine  in  biological  samples  from  animal  studies  were  determined  by microbiological and/or radioisotope assays.

Microbiological assays were conducted with Escherichia col i grown on plates. A standard curve was developed to plot the inhibitory effect against azacitidine concentration. The concentration/response curve  was  linear  between  the  concentrations  of  3.12  and  25 μ g/ml  and  the  lowest  detectable concentration was 2 μ g/ml. The limit of assay sensitivity was 0.11 μ g/ml of mouse blood. Azacitidine was not detectable in solid tissues.

Tissue levels of azacitidine were  measured  in  mice  following 14 C-azacitidine administration. Azacitidine-associated radioactivity was expressed as CPM (counts per minute) of 14 CO2 released on combustion of 10 mg fresh tissue or 0.1 ml of blood. Tissue distribution in all major tissues, organs and biological fluids was determined using whole-body autoradiography. Tissue concentrations were interpolated from standard curves.

LC-MS/MS methods were developed and validated to detect azacitidine in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)  over  the  concentration  range  24.4-1220 ng/ml  (0.1-5 µM)  and  in  dog  plasma  over  the concentration range of 1-1000 and 5-2000 ng/ml. The methods involved extraction of azacitidine from plasma samples with acetonitrile followed by LC-MS/MS analysis.

-  Absorption

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No well-designed study was conducted to evaluate absorption of azacitidine through the s.c. route in animal. In one study performed in dogs, partial bioavailability data were collected and the absolute p.o.  bioavailability  was  approximately  67% compared with the s.c. bioavailability of approximately 71%. There were no consistent gender differences in the pharmacokinetics following p.o. administration. Systemic exposure increased with increasing dose with little evidence of accumulation following repeat administration. Table 3 provides a summary of the available pharmacokinetic data in mouse and dog.

##  Distribution

The  first  tissue  distribution  study  in  AKR  mice  treated  i.p.  with 14 C-azacitidine  showed  that radioactivity  declined  sharply  in  blood  during  the  first  8  hours  but  was  still  present  24  hours  after dosing.  Tissue  radioactivity  was  determined  in  thymus,  spleen,  kidney,  liver,  brain,  and  muscle. Concentrations  of  radioactivity  were  higher  and  retention  was  longer  in  spleen  and  thymus  than  in other tissues. Concentrations in kidney and liver were significantly less than in lymphoid tissues and only small amounts of radioactivity were recorded in muscle and brain.

A  recent  tissue  distribution  study  was  conducted  in  ICR  mice  treated  p.o.  (50  mg/kg)  or  i.v. (10 mg/kg) with 14 C-azacitidine (25). Using whole body autoradiography, tissues were examined for radioactivity content at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 24, and 48 hours after dosing. Radioactivity was widely distributed throughout all organs and tissues. Other than the excretory/metabolic tissues (which include kidney, liver, bile, gall bladder and urinary bladder) and the gastrointestinal system tissues, consequent levels of  radioactivity  were  recovered  in  spleen,  bone  marrow,  thymus,  pancreas,  adrenal  gland,  salivary gland,  lacrimal  gland,  prostate/uterus,  lung,  diaphragm  and  myocardium.  Most  tissues  showed maximal concentrations between 0.5 and 1 hour which declined steadily thereafter. At 48 hours, tissue concentrations of radioactivity were higher in i.v. treated animals than in those treated orally.

##  Metabolism

Azacitidine is transported into the cell by the same facilitated nucleoside transport system as uridine and  cytidine.  Intracellular  azacitidine  undergoes  3  sequential  phosphorylation  reactions  resulting  in azacitidine  triphosphate.  The  first  phosphorylation  reaction,  the  rate-limiting  step  in  azacitidine metabolism, is mediated by the enzyme uridine-cytidine kinase (a.k.a. uridine kinase). This reaction is subject  to  feedback  inhibition  by  either  uridine  triphosphate  (UTP)  or  cytidine  triphosphate  (CTP).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Azacitidine triphosphate may then be incorporated into RNA and DNA resulting in the pharmacologic effects of demethylation and cytotoxicity.

Catabolism of azacitidine is by spontaneous hydrolysis and by deamination. Spontaneous hydrolysis of azacitidine results in equilibration with n-formylguanylribosylurea (RGU-CHO) culminating in the irreversible formation of guanylribosylurea (RGU). The labile hydrolysis product, RGU-CHO, has a biological  activity  approximately  one-fourth  of  the  potency  of  azacitidine.  Although  the  RGU degradation product has not been completely characterised, it exhibited no pronounced toxicity using in vivo or in vitro test systems.

Ribofuranosylbiuret (RB)

Formylamidinoribofuranosylbiuret (RB-CHO)

Incubation of [14C] 5-azacitidine with mouse hepatic S9 fractions yielded 2 products (RGU-CHO and RGU); incubation with human hepatic S9 fractions produced an additional two additional compounds identified as ribofuranosylbiuret and formylamidinoribofuranosylbiuret. The formation of metabolites was independent of NADPH and occurred at the same rate with either hepatic S9 or denaturated S9 preparations, implying that metabolism was catalysed by cytosolic enzymes.

The  metabolic  stability  of  azacitidine  was  evaluated  in  heat-treated  and  untreated  intestinal  tissue homogenates prepared from dog, pig and human. All segments from the dog, pig and human intestinal tissues  exhibited  esterase  activities  and  showed  that  heat-treatment  abolished  or  reduced  such activities.

##  Excretion

Limited data on the excretion of azacitidine in mice were presented in the paper by Raska et al. (23). Urinary excretion was studied in mice and dogs (table 3). In mice administered 14C-azacitidine i.p , approximately 45% of the radio-labelled compound was recovered in the urine. Moreover, recovery of 14C-azacitidine delivered by p.o. or i.v. routes of administration demonstrated that the majority of the excreted radioactivity was found in urine (60.5 ± 6.6% and 67±8.8% of the dose, respectively) and only a fraction of the dose was recovered in the faeces (17.2±4.5% and 1.3±0.6%, respectively). An attempt was made to characterise the major metabolites found in urine with HPLC, GC and MS. Six radioactive peaks were identified as summarised in table 4 (29).

Table 4 Urinary metabolites of 14 C azacitidine in mice

| HPLC peak   | Identity                                    | %recovery b   |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|
| I           | 5-azauracil                                 | 23.2 ± 5.4    |
| II          | Not characterised but maybe 5-azauridine    | 19.9 ± 6.0    |
| III         | 5-azacytosine (maybe a contaminant)         | 4.6 ± 0.1     |
| IV          | Azacitidine (a.k.a. 5-azacytidine)          | 3.6 ± 2.0     |
| V           | Ribofuranosylbiuret                         | 26.5 ± 5.0    |
| VI          | Multiple components partially characterised | 19.1 ± 1.8    |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A  urinary  metabolic  profiling  study  was  also  performed  with 14 C-azacitidine  in  dogs  dosed  at 0.5 mg/kg i.v.. Recovery of radioactivity in urine during the 4-hour interval after dosing represented 33% of the dose (30). The same 6 HPLC 14 C peaks that were present in mice were present in the dog.

##  Pharmacokinetic drug interactions

The  potential  for  azacitidine  to  inhibit  human  hepatic  cytochrome  P450  (CYP)  enzymes  has  been evaluated. The following enzymes were used in the evaluation: CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. Azacitidine was not found to inhibit isozymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 at a maximal concentration of 100 µM (30-fold higher than clinically achievable plasma concentration of azacitidine following the recommended dose), although a low to moderate inhibition of CYP1A2 and 2E1 was observed. In addition, the effects of azacitidine on the expression of cytochrome P450 were evaluated. Cultures of human hepatocytes were exposed to azacitidine at various concentrations for 72 h.  Treatment  of  human  hepatocytes  with  azacitidine  did  not  cause  increased  activity  in  CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 but an unexpected inhibitory effect on 3A4/5 activity was observed at 100 μ M. The inhibitory effect was thought to be due to CYP 3A4/5 protein suppression.

## Toxicology

Toxicology data were collected from in vitro studies and in vivo studies conducted in mice, rats, dogs, and rhesus monkeys.  The studies are detailed in table 5.

The relative sensitivity of various animal species to azacitidine from selected studies is presented in table 9.

## Table 9 Species sensitivity to azacitidine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

| Species   | Route   | Duration          | Maximum tolerated dose a   | Lethal dose               |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Mouse     | i.p.    | Single dose       | < 89 mg/kg (267 mg/m 2 )   | > 89 mg/kg (267 mg/m 2 )  |
| Mouse     | i.v.    | Single dose       | 63 mg/kg (189 mg/m 2 )     | 79 mg/kg (237 mg/m 2 )    |
| Mouse     | i.v.    | 5-days            | 6.5 mg/kg (19.5 mg/m 2 )   | 11.3 mg/kg (33.9 mg/m 2 ) |
| Rat       | i.v.    | Single dose       | ~ 38 mg/kg (228 mg/m 2 )   | 41 mg/kg (246 mg/m 2 )    |
| Dog       | i.v.    | Single dose       | 6.65 mg/kg (133 mg/m 2 )   | 13.2 mg/kg (264 mg/m 2 )  |
| Dog       | i.v.    | 5 days            | 2.2 mg/kg (44 mg/m 2 )     | 4.4 mg/kg (88 mg/m 2 )    |
| Dog       | i.v.    | 5-days x 2 cycles | 0.55 mg/kg (11 mg/m 2 )    | 1.1 mg/kg (22 mg/m 2 )    |

a Conversions from mg/kg to mg/m 2 were based on approximate human and animal weights using a web-based Oncology Tools dose calculator. The doses in mg/kg for mouse, rat, dog, and monkey were multiplied by 3, 6, 20, and 14.5, respectively to obtain the corresponding dose in mg/m 2

##  Genotoxicity

A number of genotoxicity studies have been submitted in the format of bibliographical references (12, 18,  39-48).  Azacitidine  had  both  mutagenic  and  clastogenic  activity  in  several  bacterial  and mammalian cell systems under the conditions tested.

-  Carcinogenicity

Four of carcinogenicity studies have been submitted in the format of bibliographical references (4951).  Azacitidine  has  carcinogenic  potential  in  rodents  capable  of  inducing  tumours  in  a  variety  of organs (lymphoid system, lung, mammary gland, and skin).

-  Reproduction toxicity

A number of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in mice (i.p.) and rats (i.p.) have been submitted in the format of bibliographical references (13, 19, 52-59). Azacitidine was associated with significant risk to the embryo,  foetus and male  reproduction system. The  reproductive and developmental toxicity of azacitidine results from the cytotoxicity to rapidly dividing cells (S-phase) and alterations in gene expression. Spermatogenesis in rats is at risk because of the high level of cell proliferation. In embryofoetal development studies, azacitidine caused dose-dependant embryotoxicity and teratogenicity at doses as low as 0.3-0.5 mg/kg (or 3 to 6 mg/m 2 ).    Higher  doses  increased the incidence of foetal malformations and embryolethality.

-  Local tolerance

Local tolerance studies were conducted.

-  Other toxicity studies

## None submitted

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The majority of azacitidine given subcutaneously is excreted in the urine. The amount of azacitidine and its metabolites reaching the environment as a result of the administration of azacitidine powder for suspension for injection is  not  considered  to  be  sufficient  to  significantly  change  the  quality  of  the human environment. As azacitidine is highly water soluble and the octanol/water partition coefficient (log  Ko/w)  is  less  than  0.5  over  a  pH  range  of  2-12,  the  compound  is  most  likely  to  amass predominantly in the aquatic environment. Emission patterns will consist mainly of a diffuse release into waste water systems due to excretion of the active substance and/or its metabolites by patients. Additional data on the ERA will be provided as a follow up measure.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by multiple mechanisms  including cytotoxicity on abnormal haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and hypomethylation of DNA. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine may result from multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of DNA, RNA  and  protein  synthesis,  incorporation  into  RNA  and  DNA,  and  activation  of  DNA  damage pathways. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. Incorporation of azacitidine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

into DNA results in the inactivation of DNA methyltransferases, leading to hypomethylation of DNA. DNA  hypomethylation  of  aberrantly  methylated  genes  involved  in  normal  cell  cycle  regulation, differentiation  and  death  pathways  may  result  in  gene  re-expression  and  restoration  of  cancersuppressing  functions  to  cancer  cells.  The  relative  importance  of  DNA  hypomethylation  versus cytotoxicity or other activities of azacitidine to clinical outcomes has not been established.

No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted. These are well known and described in the literature.  Azacitidine  has  also  immunosuppressive,  antimicrobial,  genotoxic,  embryotoxic, teratogenic  and  carcinogenic  effects  (11-20).  These  secondary  effects  are  in  common  with  the pharmacologic activity of other pyrimidine analogues used as antiviral and antineoplastic agents (21). The absence of additional studies is considered acceptable.

The Applicant has provided sufficient  justification  for  the  absence  of  specific  safety  pharmacology data. Therefore due to the abundance of clinical data together with the data from the dog toxicity study this omission is accepted.

No  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  studies  were  submitted.  This  is  acceptable  in  view  of  the monotherapy indication. Concurrent administration of azacitidine with other antineoplastic agents may affect the pharmacodynamics of either compound.

Systemic  exposure  increased  with  increasing  dose  with  little  evidence  of  accumulation  following repeat  administration.  Radioactivity  was  widely  distributed  throughout  all  organs  and  tissues.  Most tissues showed maximal concentrations between 0.5 and 1 hour which declined steadily thereafter. In mice, recovery of 14C-azacitidine delivered by p.o. or i.v. routes of administration demonstrated that the majority of the excreted radioactivity was found in urine (60.5 ± 6.6% and 67±8.8% of the dose, respectively) and only a fraction of the dose was recovered in the faeces.

No  non-clinical toxicity studies were  performed  using  the s.c. route, the intended route of administration  in  humans.  Nevertheless,  the  results  obtained  from  i.v.  and  i.p.  administration  are considered adequate to characterise the systemic toxicity of azacitidine taking into account the known toxic profile of azacitidine.

Azacitidine has both mutagenic and clastogenic activity. Azacitidine has carcinogenic potential. These findings are consistent with that of other nucleoside analogues.

Azacitidine was associated with significant risk to the embryo, foetus and male reproduction system. Azacitidine should not be administered to pregnant women or women of childbearing potential. These constraints should also apply to men being treated with azacitidine whose partners are of childbearing potential.  These  risks  are  adequately  addressed  in  the  SPC.  MDS  is  a  disease  of  the  elderly  and, therefore, no offspring study has been performed. This omission is acceptable.

Local tolerance studies were submitted. However, the findings from these studies were not relevant as none  of  these  studies  were  conducted  using  the  s.c.  route  of  administration.  Sufficient  data  are available from the toxicology studies and no further local tolerance studies are required.

As  the  clinical  data  appears  to  be  sufficient  to  assess  dependency,  no  applicant-sponsored  animal studies have been conducted to assess the dependence potential of azacitidine.

While  studies  have  been  submitted  to  assess  the  degradation  products  of  azacitidine,  no  toxicity studies  specifically  designed  to  assess  toxicity  of  individual  azacitidine  metabolites  have  been submitted. However, individual impurities have each been limited to 0.15% w/w to correspond with the qualification threshold identified by ICH Guidance Q3A (R2).

The  environmental  risk  assessment  for  azacitidine  cannot  be  completed  based  on  the  assessment provided. The applicant committed to submit a phase II assessment as a follow-up measure.

Based on in vitro data, azacitidine metabolism does not appear to be mediated by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYPs), UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), sulfotransferases (SULTs), and glutathione  transferases  (GSTs);  interactions  related  to  these  metabolizing  enzymes in  vivo are therefore  considered  unlikely.  Clinically  significant  inhibitory  or  inductive  effects  of  azacitidine  on cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely (see SPC section 5.2). The applicant will conduct a new study to evaluate the interaction of azacitidine with CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 isozymes.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Introduction

The clinical development of azacitidine was initiated by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), and clinical  results  were  published  during  the  period  1989  to  2002.  The  main  clinical  study  in  this application is study AZA-001, an open-label, parallel-group, randomized, controlled phase 3 clinical trial (AZA-PH-GL-2003-CL-001  later  named  AZA-001).  The  CHMP  granted  an  accelerated assessment procedure pursuant to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for Vidaza on 24 January  2008,  as  the  designation  of  an  unmet  medical  need  in  the  defined  patient  category  was fulfilled  (higher-risk-MDS  incidence  estimate  1-2/100,000).  Based  on  the  claims  and  description  of the available data provided by the applicant, the product was considered to be of major public health interest  from  the  viewpoint  that  it  might  provide  a  treatment  option  that  could  have  supplementary value with regard to the present therapeutic arsenal for patients with MDS. However, due to major objections at D120, the application reverted to a normal timetable.

The  proposed  route  of  administration  of  azacitidine  is  subcutaneous,  with  a  recommended  starting dose for MDS patients of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. Azacitidine can be administered in an outpatient setting and patients should be monitored for haematologic and renal toxicities as dosage adjustments may be necessary. The duration of clinical use may be greater than one year.

## GCP

Some  of  the  clinical  trials  were  originally  conducted  under  prior  to  implementation  of  ICH  GCP guidelines. The AZA-PH-GL-2003-CL-001 study was stated to be performed in accordance with GCP.

## Pharmacokinetics

The human pharmacokinetics of azacitidine was initially investigated in the 1970s following treatment of  patients  with  the  radiolabelled  drug.  More  recently,  study  AZA-2002-BA-002,  a  multicentre, randomised, open-label crossover design in 6 MDS patients comparing the pharmacokinetics of single dose  s.c.  versus  i.v.  doses  of  azacitidine  75 mg/m .  Additionally,  a  published  report  described  the pharmacokinetics of s.c. administered azacitidine when given with phenylbutyrate (by i.v. infusion) ( 2 62). Supportive studies have also been conducted to assess azacitidine interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes.

-  Absorption

## Bioavailability

In  study  AZA-2002-BA-002,  azacitidine  was  administered  to  6  MDS  patients.  Patients  received either a single dose of 75 mg/m 2 administered either s.c. or i.v. over 10 minutes in a randomised 2-way crossover design.

The mean plasma concentration versus time curves for s.c. and i.v. administrations of azacitidine are shown in Figure 1 and pharmacokinetic parameters are summarised in table 10.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Azacitidine was rapidly absorbed following s.c. administration with maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax )  of  750  ±  403  ng/ml  occurring  at  the  first  post-dose  sampling  time  (0.5  hour).  Following  i.v. infusion, C max was seen after 5 minutes in 2 of 6 patients and at the end of saline flush (11 minutes) in the remaining 4 patients.

Table 10 Study AZA-2002-BA-002 - Azacitidine pharmacokinetic parameters following s.c. and i.v. dose administration in MDS patients

| Route   | C max (ng/ml)   | AUC 0-inf (ng*h/ml)   | t max (h)   | t 1/2 (h)   | CL (l/h)   | V d (l)   | F 1 (90% CI) (%)   |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------|--------------------|
| s.c.    | 750 ± 403       | 960 ± 458             | 0.5 ± 0.0   | 0.69 ± 0.14 | 167 ± 49 1 | NA        | 89 (70-112)        |
| i.v.    | 2750 ± 1089     | 1044 ± 286            | 0.15 ± 0.05 | 0.36 ± 0.02 | 147 ± 47   | 76 ± 26   | NA                 |

Absolute bioavailability, based on AUC 0-inf of  the  SC/IV ratio of the geometric least squares means was 89% (90% CI 70-112%).

##  Distribution

Pharmacokinetics in study AZA-2002-BA-002 showed that the mean volume of distribution following i.v. dosing was 76 ± 26 l (0.99 ± 0.34 l/kg).

##  Elimination

## Excretion

Excretion  of  azacitidine  and  metabolites  were  characterised  by  radiotracer  studies  in  patients  with advanced cancer following both i.v. and s.c. administration (63, 64). Based on total radioactivity in plasma,  which  represented  parent  drug  plus  circulating  metabolites,  it  was  shown  that  kidneys excreted  azacitidine  and/or  its  metabolites,  with  50  (s.c.)  to  100%  (i.v.)  of  the  administered radioactivity recovered in the urine over 48 to 72 hours. Following i.v. administration, less than 1% was excreted in the faeces.  The  elimination  half-lives  in  this  study  were  similar  (3.4-6.2 hours)  for both modes of administration.

In study AZA-2002-BA-002,  azacitidine  was  rapidly  eliminated following either s.c. or i.v. administration.  The  mean  half-life  after  i.v.  administration  was  0.36  hours,  while  that  after  s.c. administration was slightly longer (0.69 hours). The apparent (s.c.) clearance (167 l/h or 2791 ml/min) and  systemic  (i.v.)  clearance  (147  l/h)  of  azacitidine  far  exceeded  literature  values  of  glomerular

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

filtration  rate  (approximately  125  ml/min)  and  total  renal  blood  flow  (1200  ml/min)  in  healthy patients.

## Metabolism

No in vivo metabolism studies were submitted.

## Inter-conversion

Upon reconstitution of the azacitidine medicinal product the conformation of the product were found to convert to pseudopolymorphic Form III. Form III is the bioavailable form since it is always formed in water regardless of the original polymorphic form of the active substance or medicinal product.

## Pharmacokinetics of metabolites

No studies on the pharmacokinetics of metabolites were submitted.

Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism

No data were submitted.

-  Dose proportionality and time dependencies

## Dose proportionality

No  studies  on  dose  proportionality  have  been  submitted.  This  will  be  addressed  as  a  follow  up measure.

## Time dependency

Based  on  preliminary  analyses,  the  plasma  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  azacitidine  following  7 consecutive daily doses of azacitidine is essentially super-imposable upon the profile following single dose  treatment,  although  there  is  some  variability  at  very  low  concentrations  in  the  tail  end  of  the curves (see figure 2). The formal report will be submitted when completed.

## Impaired renal function

The effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been studied.  This will be addressed as a follow up measure.

The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been studied.

## Gender

Safety subgroup analyses did not reveal any clinically relevant differences between genders.

## Race

More  than  90%  of  the  patients  enrolled  in  the  CALGB  and  AZA  studies  were  Caucasian  and, therefore, no safety subgroup analysis for race could be made.

## Weight

The effects of weight on the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been studied.

## Elderly

The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been studied. In the pivotal clinical Study AZA-001, a large proportion of patients was over 65 (84/179 &gt; than 65; 38/179 &gt; 75 years of age; maximum age, 88 years). Also in the earlier Studies CALGB 8921 and 9221, a large proportion of  patients  were  &gt; 75  years  of  age.  Safety  subgroup  analyses  did  not  reveal  any  clinically  relevant differences between different age groups.

## Children

The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been studied.

-  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

Clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine were not submitted.

In vitro experimental data indicate that azacitidine is not metabolised via CYPs, UGTs, SULTs and GSTs. Although, clinical interactions involving these major metabolism pathways are not expected, interaction of azacitidine with CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 will be addressed in future studies as a follow up measure.

## Pharmacodynamics

No clinical pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted. A review of published non-clinical data was presented to demonstrate the effect of azacitidine on DNA methylation, gene expression and cell differentiation in normal and neoplastic cells.

The proposed dosage regimen of azacitidine, as used in the major studies supporting this MAA, was based on clinical results obtained in the studies CALGB 8421 and CALGB 8921. In the study CALGB 8421, it was demonstrated that azacitidine is active in the treatment of higher-risk MDS when given IV or SC at 75 mg/m 2 /day for 7 consecutive days every 28 days. This dosage was initially based on the clinical  experience  earlier  obtained  with  azacitidine  at  140  mg/day,  for  the  treatment  of  sickle  cell anaemia and beta-thalassemia.

## Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The  pharmacokinetics  of  azacitidine  were  studied  following  single  75  mg/m 2 doses  given  by subcutaneous and intravenous administration.

## Absorption

Azacitidine  was  rapidly  absorbed  after  subcutaneous  administration  with  peak  plasma  azacitidine concentrations  of  750  ±  403  ng/ml  occurring  at  0.5  h  (the  first  sampling  point)  after  dosing.  The absolute  bioavailability  of  azacitidine  after  subcutaneous  relative  to  intravenous  administration  was approximately 89 % based on area under the curve (AUC).

## Distribution

Following intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution was 76 ± 26 l, and systemic clearance was 147 ± 47 l/h.

## Metabolism

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on in vitro data, azacitidine metabolism does not appear to be mediated by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYPs), UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), sulfotransferases (SULTs), and glutathione transferases (GSTs).

Metabolism  of  azacitidine  is  by  spontaneous  hydrolysis  and  by  deamination  mediated  by  cytidine deaminase.  In  human  liver  S9  fractions,  formation  of  metabolites  was  independent  of  NADPH implying any metabolism would be catalysed by cytosolic enzymes. In vitro studies of azacitidine with cultured  human  hepatocytes  indicate  that  at  concentrations  of  1.0 μ M  to  100 μ M  (i.e.  up  to approximately 30-fold higher than clinically achievable concentrations), azacitidine does not induce cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP) 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4 or 3A5. In a study to assess inhibition of a series  of  P450  isoenzymes  (CYP  1A2,  2C9,  2C19,  2D6,  2E1  and  3A4)  incubated  with  100 μ M azacitidine,  IC50 values  could  not  be  determined,  therefore,  enzyme  inhibition  by  azacitidine  at clinically achievable plasma concentrations is unlikely.

## Excretion

Azacitidine is cleared rapidly from plasma with a mean elimination half-life (t ½) after subcutaneous administration of 41 ± 8 minutes. Urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and/or its metabolites. Following intravenous and subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine, 5085 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine, while &lt; 1 % was recovered in faeces.

## Special populations

The  effects  of  renal  or  hepatic  impairment  (see  SPC  section  4.2),  gender,  age,  or  race  on  the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been formally studied.

Overall,  the  non-clinical  and  clinical  studies  have  elucidated  that  the  renal  excretion  of  unchanged azacitidine  is  minor  and  that  spontaneous  hydrolysis  products  provides  a  major  portion  of  urinary metabolites.  Therefore,  it is not anticipated that renal impairment  will  significantly  alter the pharmacokinetics  of  parent  azacitidine.  However,  as  the  kidney  does  play  a  significant  role  in  the excretion of azacitidine and its metabolites, a study to assess the effects of renal impairment on the disposition of azacitidine in adult cancer patients will be submitted.

The  effects  of  hepatic  impairment  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  azacitidine  have  not  been  studied. Azacitidine appears not to be metabolised by hepatic CYPs, UGTs, SULTs or GSTs and the proposed SPC advises caution in patients with hepatic impairment.

## Pharmacogenomics

The  effect  of  known  cytidine  deaminase  polymorphisms  on  azacitidine  metabolism  has  not  been formally investigated.

## Plasma protein binding of azacitidine has not been directly evaluated.

Azacitidine can reactivate latent viruses such as Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) in vitro (tissue culture) and can  induce  EBV  antigen  production  in  EBV+  patients  treated  with  azacitidine.  However,  no  link between  re-activation  of  latent  viruses  leading  to  overt  clinical  disease  in  patients  treated  with azacitidine has been found.

No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted.

The applicant  committed  to  submit  the  results  of  a  Phase  I,  Open-Label,  Dose-Escalation  Study  to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Oral Azacitidine in Subjects With Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) or Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, as a follow-up measure.

## Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of azacitidine in the treatment of MDS was based on 4 studies (table 11): the pivotal study AZA-001, the Phase III supportive study CALGB 9221 and 2 additional Phase II uncontrolled studies CALGB 8921 and CALGB 8421.

-  Dose response study (ies)

The  proposed  dosage  regimen  of  azacitidine  is  based  on  clinical  results  obtained  in  the  supportive studies CALGB 8421 and CALGB 8921. It was demonstrated that azacitidine is active in the treatment of higher-risk MDS when given i.v. or s.c. at 75 mg/m 2 /day for 7 consecutive days every 28 days. This dosage was initially based on the clinical experience earlier obtained with azacitidine at 140 mg/day, for the treatment of sickle cell anaemia and beta thalassemia.

Study AZA-001 and the Phase III study CALGB 9221 were initiated with the same starting dose for azacitidine  (75 mg/m 2 /day,  subcutaneously,  for  7  days,  q4w)  and  activity  was  observed  with  an acceptable toxicity profile.

In  study  AZA-001,  bone  marrow  samples  for  methylation  testing  were  collected  for  assessing  the relationship between the effect of azacitidine with DNA demethylation and clinical response and/or adverse events. However, no proper dose response has been formally established. The effects of doseresponse  or  exposure-response  data  of  azacitidine  on  DNA  demethylation  effects  and  data  on  the relationship between a level of DNA demethylation and response rate and/or adverse events were not investigated in these trials.

-  Main study (ies)

Study AZA-001 entitled 'A Multicenter, Randomized, Open-Label, Parallel-Group, Phase 3 Trial of Subcutaneous Azacitidine Plus Best Supportive Care Versus Conventional Care Regimens Plus Best Supportive Care for the Treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)' is the main pivotal study submitted by the applicant to support the claimed indication for azacitidine.

## METHODS

## Study participants

The study was a controlled, randomized, open label, parallel-group design Phase III study conducted in 79 sites from 15 countries.

The main eligibility criteria were:

- -Patients ≥ 18 years with a life expectancy ≥ 3 months
- -Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2

-an IPSS classification of Intermediate-2 (INT-2) or high; primary MDS diagnosed as RAEB or RAEB-T  (FAB  classification)  or  CMMoL  (modified  FAB  classification)  with  monocytosis  in peripheral blood &gt; 1 x 10 9 /l, dysplasia in 1 or more myeloid cell lines, 10 to 29% blasts in the bone marrow, and white blood cells &lt; 13,000 x 10 6 /l

- -no prior treatment with transplantation or cytotoxic therapy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -unlikely to proceed to bone marrow or stem cell transplantation following remission.

## Treatments

Patients were randomised in 1:1 ratio between the following 2 treatment groups:

- -azacitidine 75 mg/m 2 s.c. for 7 days every 28 days plus best supportive care (BSC) or
- -conventional care treatment regimen (CCR) plus BSC.

The conventional care treatment regimen consisted of 3 options (one of which was to be determined for all patients by the investigator prior to randomisation to avoid potential bias):

- -BSC only
- -BSC in addition to low-dose cytarabine SC for 20 mg/m 2 /day for 14 days every 28 to 42 days until the end of the study or

-BSC in addition to standard chemotherapy administered for induction, as a continuous intravenous infusion  of  cytarabine  100  to  200  mg/m 2 /day  IV  for  7  days  with  an  anthracycline  (daunorubicin, idarubicin  or  mitoxantrone)  on  Day  1,  2  and  3  and  for  those  eligible,  1  or  2  consolidation  cycles administered  as  continuous  intravenous  infusions  of  cytarabine  for  3  to  7  days  with  the  same anthracycline that was used at induction on days 1 and 2 (each cycle between 28 to 70 days from the start of the previous cycle).

Eligible patients were randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment groups with stratification by FAB and IPSS classification (RAEB/INT-2, RAEB/high, RAEB-T/INT-2, or RAEB-T/high) (patients diagnosed with CMMoL were  to  be  randomized  to  the  FAB  stratum  of  RAEB  or  RAEB-T  based  on  their  bone marrow blast counts: those with counts 10% to 20% as RAEB, those with 21% to 29% as RAEB-T).

Treatment options in the conventional care regimens were assigned by the investigator based on local practice  and  on  evaluation  of  the  patient's  underlying  disease  condition  at  the  time  of  screening. Treatment assignment was not changed after randomisation.

## Objectives

Primary study objective was to determine the effect of azacitidine plus BSC as compared with CCR plus BSC on overall survival in MDS patients.

Secondary objectives were to determine the effect of azacitidine plus BSC, relative to that of CCR plus BSC, on:

- -time to AML transformation or death from any cause.
- -time-to-transformation  to  AML  defined  as  the  number  of  days  from  the  date  of  randomisation until  the  date  of  documented  AML  transformation,  defined  as  a  bone  marrow  blast  count ≥ 30% independent of baseline bone marrow count and censored at death

-haematologic status (peripheral counts, need for platelet and red blood cell transfusions and status according to IWG criteria [haematologic response and haematologic improvement]) and episodes of infections requiring IV antibiotics (antibacterial or antifungal) or antivirals

- -time-to-relapse  after  complete  remission  (CR)  or  partial  remission  (PR)  or  disease  progression (according to IWG criteria), censored at death
- -safety and toxicity  azacitidine plus BSC, relative to that of CCR plus BSC, in MDS patients
- -to examine the pharmacoeconomic differences in MDS patients treated with azacitidine plus BSC, as compared with patients receiving CCR plus BSC (data not shown).

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival as defined as defined as the number of days from the date of randomisation until the date of death from any cause.

The secondary endpoints were time to transformation to AML (bone marrow blast &gt; 30% ) or death, time to transformation to AML, haematologic response (and improvements) and cytogenetic response based on 2000 IWG criteria for MDS, time to disease progression, relapse after CR or PR or death, transfusion status and number of on-treatment AE of severe infection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sample size

The protocol specified that 354 patients were to be randomised over an estimated period of 18-months and  monitored  for  at  least  12  months  of  treatment  and  follow-up.  This  would  result  in  about 167 deaths  after  study  duration  of  30  months.  A  log  rank  analysis  of  167  deaths  would  have approximately 90% power to detect a difference in overall survival curves characterised by a hazard ratio of 0.60 (median overall survival of 18.3 months for azacitidine and 11 months for CCR).

## Randomisation

This  study  used  blocked  randomisation  that  stratified  patients  by  FAB  and  IPSS  classifications  to ensure a balanced assignment of patients to the 2 treatment groups. This randomisation process used a remote centralised system.

## Blinding (masking)

The study is an open-label study, but the haematological response (and its duration) for the primary analysis (though not haematological improvement), the FAB and WHO  diagnoses, IPSS classifications and IWG was performed by a blinded independent central reviewer.

## Statistical methods

For purposes of time-to-event analyses involving death and transformation to AML, the duration was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the minimum of the date of death or the date of censor. The date of censor could be due to administrative censoring (for interim or final analysis), date of last contact if the patient was lost to follow-up or date the patient withdrew consent from follow-up. For  the  analyses  during  the  treatment  period,  the  censor  date  could  have  been  the  patient's  last treatment study visit (if this was the minimum date among date of death, AML or last contact).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## RESULTS

## Participant flow

Figure 3 Study AZ-001 - Patient disposition

<!-- image -->

- a 1 patient in the azacitidine group, 2 in the BSC-only group, 1 in the low-dose cytarabine group, and 2 in the standard chemo group withdrew consent for follow-up and did not enter the follow-up period.
- b Patients who completed the treatment period included those who died or transformed to AML during the treatment period, or were receiving study drug at the time of study closure.
- c Patients were still in follow-up at the time of study closure. Follow-up was terminated at the time of the final study close-out visit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Recruitment

The  trial  enrolled  738  patients  and  randomised  358  over  30  months  and  the  study  duration  lasted 44 months. This resulted in 195 deaths (16.8% more deaths than originally planned) and 95% power for this trial under the design assumptions of the protocol.

## Conduct of the study

Overall, 30.2% of patients treated with azacitidine and 39.1% treated with CCR had at least 1 major protocol deviation. The most frequently observed protocol deviations are presented in table 12.

## Numbers analysed

Disposition of patients included in study AZA-001 is shown in figure 3, 179 patients were randomised to  the  azacitidine  treatment  group  and  179  to  the  combined  CCR  treatment  group;  these  patients comprised the ITT population.

The PP population consisted of 234 (65.4%) patients, 54 patients in the azacitidine-treatment group and 70 in the CCR group eventually encountered ≥ 1 major protocol violation and were excluded from the per protocol population (table 12).

The safety population is comprised of 340 (95.0%) patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least one post-dose safety assessment. Because BSC-only treatment may consist of blood products  or  antibiotics  administered  only  as  needed,  patients  randomised  to  the  CCR  group  and assigned to BSC-only were included in the safety population if they had at least 1 post-randomisation assessment.

## Outcomes and estimation

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  an  analysis  of  OS  (time-to-death  from  any  cause)  for  the  ITT population by treatment group as defined by the number of days from randomization date until death by  any  cause,  is  provided  in  table  16.  A  Kaplan  Meier  plot  of  time  to  death  from  any  cause  by treatment group for the ITT population is presented in figure 4.

The Kaplan Meier median overall survival times were 24.5 months and 15.0 months in the azacitidine and combined CCR groups, respectively. Azacitidine was statistically superior to the combined CCR group for prolonging survival, with an increase in median survival of 9.4 months (stratified log rank p = 0.0001). The Kaplan Meier time to the first quartile was 10.5 and 5.1 months for azacitidine and combined CCR, respectively, for a difference of 4.8 months (95% CI 0.8, 8.7 months; p = 0.0178).

Subgroup  analyses  were  performed.  Each  set  of  CCR  subgroup  patients  have  been  compared  with either a) all azacitidine recipients or b) the set of azacitidine recipients that would have received the same CCR treatment if they had been randomised to the control group. Similar to the ITT analysis, the Kaplan Meier median time-to-death was longer in each of the azacitidine groups (by approximately 9.5 months) compared with the CCR groups within each selection group and the risk of death in the azacitidine  group  was  reduced  compared  with  CCR.  The  difference  in  the  survival  curves  was statistically different in the BSC selection group; they were not statistically different in the low-dose cytarabine and standard chemotherapy selection groups due to the low patient numbers.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

An analysis in the PP population by treatment group provided similar survival advantage as observed in the ITT population (10.1 vs. 9.4 months, respectively).

Sensitivity analyses demonstrated no meaningful changes to the conclusions regarding the effect of azacitidine on overall survival.

The effect of treatment on the primary endpoint was performed for the pre-specified subgroups of age, gender, FAB classification, FAB classification and ≥ 65  years  old,  WHO classification, IPSS, IPSS cytogenetic  risk  group,  IPSS  cytopenia  risk  group,  IPSS  bone  marrow  blast  risk  group,  -7/del(7q) karyotype and LDH and showed that the azacitidine group had a reduced risk of death compared with patients in the combined CCR group for all subgroups (the ITT hazard ratio [0.58] is included within the confidence interval of all subgroups) (see figure 5).

For the secondary efficacy endpoints, time to transformation to AML or death showed consistent results where a median of 13.02 months compared to 7.61 months was observed in the azacitidine and combined CCR group, respectively, a difference of 5.41 months. Similar results were obtained in time -to-transformation to AML only.

Sensitivity analyses demonstrated no meaningful changes to the conclusions regarding the effect of azacitidine on time -to-transformation to AML.

The mean haemoglobin concentration in the azacitidine and CCR groups is depicted in figure 6.

The total number of RBC transfusions was 1799 in the azacitidine group and 1754 in the CCR group. When taken into account the number of patient-years, the RBC transfusion rate favoured azacitidine group:  10.63  and  18.33  per  patient-year  for  azacitidine-  and  the  CCR  group,  respectively.  Of  the 111 patients in the azacitidine group who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline, 45.0% of these patients became RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period, compared with 11.4% of the patients in the combined CCR group (p &lt; 0.0001). The 33.6% difference (95% CI 22.4, 44.6) was statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001).

The number of platelet transfusions per patient-year was slightly higher in the combined CCR group (9.4)  compared  with  the  azacitidine  group  (6.0).  The  percentage  of  patients  who  were  platelet transfusion  dependent  at  baseline  and  became  platelet  transfusion  independent  during  the  treatment period was similar in the azacitidine (42.1%) and CCR group (40.7%) but remained longer platelet transfusion  independent  (approximately  7 months)  in  the  azacitidine  group.  In  patients  who  were platelet  transfusion  independent  at  baseline,  89.4%  of  the  azacitidine  patients  remained  platelet transfusion  independent  during  the  treatment  period,  compared  with  67.1%  of  the  patients  in  the combined CCR group (p &lt; 0.0001).

Response assessment encompassed Overall Response Rate (ORR), i.e., CR+PR+SD, Response Rate (CR  +PR),  haematologic  improvement  (laboratory  responses,  i.e.,  haemoglobin,  neutrophil  count, platelet  count)  and  cytogenetic  response  based  on  International  Working  Group  (IWG)  criteria  for MDS (65), were assessed by the investigator as well as by IRC (table 18).

a  The p value is from Fisher's exact test comparing the response rates between the azacitidine and the combined CCR groups b  Haematologic improvement and cytogenetic response were determined by the IRC

As determined by the IRC, the overall response rate (CR + PR + SD) was 91% in the azacitidine group compared with 78% in the combined CCR group; a statistically significant difference (p =0.0011). The median time to disease progression, relapse after CR or PR, or death from any cause was longer in the azacitidine group (14.1 months) compared with the combined CCR group (8.8 months), with a median increase of 5.3 months with azacitidine treatment (log rank p = 0.0466) investigators assessment. The percentage of patients in the azacitidine group (49%) with any haematologic improvement was 1.5fold higher compared with the combined CCR group (29%).

The percentage of patients in the azacitidine group (40%) with a major erythroid response was 3.5-fold higher compared with the combined CCR group (11%). Similarly, the percentage of patients in the azacitidine group (33%) with a major platelet response was 2-fold higher compared with the combined CCR group (14%). The median duration of haematologic improvement was longer in the azacitidine

group (13.6 months) compared with the CCR group (5.2 months) (log rank p = 0.0002). The hazard ratios of recurrent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were 1.16 and 0.95 when azacitidine group was compared to the CCR group. The risk of recurrent anaemia was reduced by 11% in the azacitidine group compared with the combined CCR group (HR 0.89, p=0.0094).

Figure 8 provides a plot of mean absolute neutrophil counts over time in the azacitidine and combined CCR groups.

The percentage of patients with a major neutrophil response was similar in the azacitidine (19%) and combined CCR (18%) groups. The mean WBC curves for the azacitidine and combined CCR groups were generally similar until approximately 17 months, when the number of patients in the CCR group became  small.  The  azacitidine  group  generally  remained  constant  until  the  30 th month,  when  the number of patients became small.

The rate of infection requiring i.v. antibiotic, antifungal or antiviral therapy was 1.5-fold higher in the combined CCR group compared with the azacitidine group. There were 27 adverse events of infection that  required  therapy  during  169  patient-years  for  a  rate  of  0.16  events  per  patient-year  in  the azacitidine group compared with 23 adverse events of infection during 96 patient-years at a rate of 0.24 events per patient-year in the CCR group. The relative risk of such infections was 0.67 (95% CI 0.35, 1.20; p = 0.1327) indicating 33% less risk of such infections for the azacitidine group relative to the CCR group. The risk of recurrent of infection requiring IV treatment was reduced by 11 and 21% in the azacitidine group and with the CCR-group, respectively. The reduced risk of infection was not statistically significantly different between the two groups.

-  Supportive study (ies)

Supportive  studies  comprise  one  open-label,  controlled,  Phase  III  study  (study  CALGB  9221)  and 2 open-label, uncontrolled, Phase II studies (studies CALGB 8421 and CALGB 8921). In these studies the primary endpoint was defined as the overall response rate (CR + PR).

Study CALGB 8421 initially planned for enrolment of up to 20 patients; however, based on the results of the first 13 patients, the enrolment goal was extended to 45 patients. Eventually 48 patients were enrolled to receive azacitidine 75 mg/m 2 as a continuous IV infusion for 7 days on a 28-day cycle for a minimum of 4 cycles.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study CALGB 8921 initially planned for enrolment of up to 50 patients over the period of 1.5 years; patients were to receive 75 mg/m 2 azacitidine SC daily for 7 days on a 28-day cycle for a minimum of 4 cycles. A total of 72 patients were included as ITT population. The mean and median total duration of  clinical  response  of  PR  or  better  for  the  responders  was  565 days  (1.5  years)  and  117  days, respectively. The median survival times of the responders and of the non-responders were 39.3 and 9.6 months, respectively. The median times-to-transformation to AML of the responders (excluding AML patients)  and  the  non-responders  were  59.1  and  21.8  months,  respectively.  Other  than  Month  12, responders  were  transfusion-free  from  the  10 th to  month  18.  Haemoglobin  concentrations  increased after the 2 nd for all patients.

Study  CALGB  9221  was  an  open-label,  multicentre,  controlled,  Phase  III  trial,  initiated  in  1994, designed  to  compare  azacitidine  plus  supportive  care  with  an  observation  group  receiving  best supportive care only in patients with any of the 5 subtypes of MDS per the FAB classification (RA, RARS, RAEB, RAEB-T, or CMMoL). The use of a BSC-only group as a control was chosen because at the time the study was conducted, there was no approved treatment for MDS. A total of 191 patients (99 azacitidine, all of which received study medication, 92 observation) were enrolled and randomised in the study at 53 centres. Patients in the azacitidine treatment arm were to receive a starting dose of 75 mg/m 2 azacitidine SC daily for 7 days on a 28-day cycle for a minimum of 4 cycles.

The primary endpoint, overall response rate, in azacitidine group was 16.2% compared to 0% in the observation  group.  The  mean  time  to  transformation  to  AML  in  the  azacitidine  group  was  45.8 months, compared with 23.5 months for the observation group (p=0.16). Median survival time, which was confounded by the cross-over design of this study, for the azacitidine group and observation group were respectively 20.1 months and 15.4 months (statistically not significant).

A summary of the results of CALGB studies is displayed in table 19.

System (IPSS), refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) and modified chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (mCMML) according to  the  French  American British (FAB) classification system. RAEB-T patients (21-30 % blasts) are now considered to be AML patients under the current WHO classification system. Azacitidine plus best  supportive  care  (BSC)  (n  =  179)  was  compared  to  conventional  care  regimens  (CCR).  CCR consisted  of  BSC  alone  (n  =  105),  low-dose  cytarabine  plus  BSC  (n  =  49)  or  standard  induction chemotherapy plus BSC (n = 25). Patients were pre-selected by their physician to 1 of the 3 CCR prior to randomisation. Patients received this pre-selected regimen if not randomised to Vidaza. As part of the inclusion criteria, patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. Patients with secondary MDS were excluded from the study. The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. Vidaza was administered at a subcutaneous (s.c.) dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days, followed by a rest period of 21 days (28-day treatment cycle) for a median of 9 cycles (range = 1-39) and a mean of 10.2 cycles. Within the Intent to Treat population (ITT), the median age was 69 years (range 38 to 88 years).

In the ITT analysis of 358 patients (179 azacitidine and 179 CCR), Vidaza treatment was associated with a median survival of 24.46 months versus 15.02 months for those receiving CCR treatment, a difference  of  9.4  months,  with  a  stratified  log-rank  p-value  of  0.0001.  The  hazard  ratio  for  the treatment effect was 0.58 (95 % CI: 0.43, 0.77). The two-year survival rates were 50.8 % in patients receiving azacitidine versus 26.2 % in patients receiving CCR (p &lt; 0.0001).

The survival benefits of Vidaza were consistent regardless of the CCR treatment option (BSC alone, low-dose cytarabine plus BSC or standard induction chemotherapy plus BSC) utilised in the control arm.

When IPSS cytogenetic subgroups were analysed, similar findings in terms of median overall survival were  observed  in  all  groups  (good,  intermediate,  poor  cytogenetics,  including  monosomy  7).  On analyses of age subgroups, an increase in median overall survival was observed for all groups (&lt; 65 years, ≥ 65 years and ≥ 75 years).

Vidaza  treatment  was  associated  with  a  median  time  to  death  or  transformation  to  AML  of  13.0 months versus 7.6 months for those receiving CCR treatment, an improvement of 5.4 months with a stratified log-rank p-value of 0.0025.

Vidaza  treatment  was  also  associated  with  a  reduction  in  cytopenias,  and  their  related  symptoms. Vidaza  treatment  led  to  a  reduced  need  for  red  blood  cell  (RBC)  and  platelet  transfusions.  Of  the patients in the azacitidine group who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline, 45.0 % of these patients became RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period, compared with 11.4 % of the patients in the combined CCR groups (a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001) difference of 33.6 % (95  %  CI:  22.4,  44.6).  In  patients  who  were  RBC  transfusion  dependent  at  baseline  and  became independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13 months in the azacitidine group.

Response was assessed by the investigator or by the Independent Review Committee (IRC). Overall response (complete remission [CR] + partial remission [PR]) as determined by the investigator was 29 % in the azacitidine group and 12 % in the combined CCR group (p = 0.0001). Overall response (CR + PR) as determined by the IRC in AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 was 7 % (12/179) in the azacitidine group compared with 1 % (2/179) in the combined CCR group (p = 0.0113). The differences between the  IRC and investigator assessments of response were a consequence of the International Working Group  (IWG)  criteria  requiring  improvement  in  peripheral  blood  counts  and  maintenance  of  these improvements for a minimum of 56 days. A survival benefit was also demonstrated in patients that had  not achieved  a complete/partial response  following  azacitidine  treatment.  Haematological improvement (major or minor) as determined by the IRC was achieved in 49 % of patients receiving azacitidine compared with 29 % of patients treated with combined CCR (p &lt; 0.0001).

In patients with one or more cytogenetic abnormalities at baseline, the percentage of patients with a major  cytogenetic  response  was  similar  in  the  azacitidine  and  combined  CCR  groups.  Minor cytogenetic response was statistically significantly (p = 0.0015) higher in the azacitidine group (34 %) compared with the combined CCR group (10 %).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Only patients with de novo disease were allowed entry into the AZA-001 study. Therefore it is not possible to assess whether there are any differences in the treatment effect between patients with de novo  and  secondary  syndromes.  The  applicant  committed  to  include  patients  with  secondary syndromes in future studies.

## Clinical safety

Azacitidine,  a  cytidine  analogue  that  is  incorporated  into  DNA  and  RNA,  can  be  toxic  to  rapidly dividing  cells,  especially  cells  that  form  the  haematopoietic  system  and  mucosal  tissue  such  as  the gastrointestinal tract. Additional toxic effects can be expected due to the demethylating capacity of the active substance.

##  Patient exposure

Although the total number of patients who received azacitidine in completed clinical MDS studies at the  time  of  submission  is  limited  to  449  patients  (table  20),  the  body  of  safety  information  can  be further enlarged by data from patients who have received azacitidine in presently ongoing studies (204 patients) and from the large number of patients who have received azacitidine and included in other data  sources  (approximately  26,938  patients).  The  combined  estimated  total  of  27,591  patients provides an extensive experience with azacitidine.

c  Includes all 92 patients randomise to BSC of whom 51 patients who crossed over to azacitidine

In study AZA-001, of the 358 randomised patients, 340 patients received at least 1 dose of study drug and  had  at  least  1  post-dose  safety  assessment  (in  the  BSC-only  group,  safety  evaluable  patients received  at  least  1  post-randomisation  safety  assessment).  Baseline  FAB  classifications  as  used  in study  AZA-001  were  applied  similarly  in  the  CALGB  studies  in  which  most  patients  had  an adjudicated  baseline  diagnosis  of  RAEB  or  RAEB-T  except  for  study  CALGB  9221  which  also included patients with RA and RARS.

In study AZA-001, the majority of patients (86.3%, 151/175) remained on 75 mg/m 2 throughout the study and few patients required a reduction of their azacitidine dose. In the CALGB studies, increases up to 100 mg/m 2 /day were allowed.

Patients with hepatic and renal dysfunction were excluded from the studies; therefore, there is limited information on these patient populations.

Patient exposure is presented in table 21.

The median prescribed dose of each of the standard chemotherapy drugs in both the induction and consolidation  cycles  was  also  consistent  with  the  protocol:  for  cytarabine,  100 mg/m 2 for  induction and  200  mg/m 2 for consolidation; and for daunorubicin,  60  mg/m 2 for both induction and consolidation;  for  idarubicin,  12  mg/m 2 for  induction  and  10.5  mg/m 2 for  consolidation.  Mean prescribed  doses  were  similar  to  the  medians  with  the  exception  of  the  mean  prescribed  dose  for cytarabine during consolidation, 389.9 mg/m 2 (as the results of accidental overdose in one patient).

Adjustments in azacitidine dose occurred in 24 patients (13.7%) and in 22 patients (12.6%), toxicity lead to discontinuation of study treatment. Moreover, 82 (46.9%) patients had a dose interruption.

* Indicates 2-fold greater frequency in the azacitidine group compared with the best supportive care group

The  most  frequently  reported  TEAE  for  patients  receiving  azacitidine  in  the  CALGB  studies  were anaemia,  nausea  and  thrombocytopenia  (within  study  CALGB  9221,  the  percentage  of  event  of anaemia was similar to that of the BSC group). System organ classes (SOC) were similar in studies CALGB 8921/9221 (SC) and CALGB 8421 (IV), except for skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders which were more frequent in study 8421.

In an analysis of TEAE by cycle onset for azacitidine in study AZA-001, findings suggested that the first occurrence of events of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, constipation, nausea, injection site  erythema  and  injection  site  reaction  were  reported  most  often  in  Cycles  1  and  2;  this  was consistent  in  the  CALGB  studies.  The  most  common  events  (&gt;  20.0%)  reported  in  the  azacitidine group during Cycles 1 and 2 included those generally associated with the known effects of this drug: thrombocytopenia (54.3%), neutropenia (50.3%), constipation (35.4%), nausea (35.4%), injection site erythema  (34.9%),  anaemia  (32.6%)  and  injection  site  reaction  (20.6%);  by  Cycles  5  and  6,  the percentages  of  these  events  ranged  from  0  (nausea)  to  6.9%  (anaemia).  Within  the  cycle,  the  first occurrence of the haematology events (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia) occurred most often  within  the  first  3  weeks  of  the  cycle  in  these  studies.  Events  typically  associated  with administration of azacitidine, including nausea, vomiting, constipation, and injection site erythema/reaction/pain,  occurred  within  the  first  week  of  the  cycle,  coinciding  with  the  days  of treatment.

When  TEAE  were  summarised  by  dose  in  studies  AZA-001  and  CALGB,  events  of  neutropenia, anaemia, nausea, vomiting, constipation and injection site reactions tended to be reported at increasing frequencies at higher doses of azacitidine. In study AZA-001, this tendency was also present with the reporting of events of thrombocytopenia.

The most frequent treatment-related events in the azacitidine treatment group are consistent with those most often reported from the all TEAEs and listed in the SmPC. The treatment-related events between the treatment groups are also consistent. All of the TEAEs listed are either known effects of the active substances used in the study or were associated with the SC administration of azacitidine (injection site erythema/reaction/pain).

In  study  AZA-001, there were no patients that had their dose of azacitidine reduced, interrupted or discontinued  due  to  renal  toxicities.  However,  abnormalities  in  hepatic  function  lead  to  treatment interruption and increased circulating enzymes lead to dose reduction.

a Patients could have more than 1 cause of death. 'On-treatment' is defined as occurring from the first dose until 42 days after the last dose of azacitidine and low-dose cytarabine, until 70 days after the last dose of standard chemotherapy, or between randomisation and the final visit for BSC.

The frequency of patients with serious adverse events (SAE) other than deaths in study AZA-001 is summarised for events that occurred in &gt; 2 patients in the azacitidine group in table 24.

##  Laboratory findings

Consistent  with  the  TEAE  and  efficacy  analyses  in  study  AZA-001,  analyses  of  haematology parameters over time confirmed that azacitidine has an effect on haematologic parameters. The median time  to  nadir  values  across  haematology  parameters  was  14  to  15  days  for  patients  treated  with azacitidine  (compared  with  17  to  21  days  for  patients  treated  with  low-dose  cytarabine  and  17  to 23 days for patients treated with standard chemotherapy). The reduction in haemoglobin and platelets diminished over time due to the cytotoxic effect of azacitidine. The median haemoglobin values in patients treated with azacitidine improved over time, an effect that was not evident with BSC-only.

Laboratory  analyses  of  chemistry  data  in  study  AZA-001,  including  electrolytes  and  measures  of hepatic and renal function, showed that even after prolonged administration, azacitidine had no effects on renal or liver function and had only very minor effects on electrolytes over time, which were also evident  in  the  BSC-only  group.  Hyperbilirubinaemia  was  reported  in  3  patients  in  the  azacitidine treatment group (3/175), but not in the other treatment groups. All of these events were reported within the first 3 cycles, and were either Grade 2 or Grade 3 events. In one patient this hyperbilirubinaemia appeared unresolved.

The CALGB studies showed similar results.

-  Safety in special populations

No specific studies have been conducted in hepatic and renal impairment, pregnancy and lactation, or in  children  and  adolescent.  However,  TEAE  were  analysed  by  age,  gender,  baseline  creatinine, albumin, bilirubin and FAB, WHO and IPSS.

In  the  azacitidine  group,  similar  percentages  of  individual  TEAEs  were  noted  for  the  majority  of TEAEs  across  the  age  categories.  Although  there  are  2-fold  differences  in  the  frequencies  of individual TEAEs between the older age groups ( ≥ 65 years or ≥ 75 years) compared with &lt; 65 years in the azacitidine group, there does not appear to be any clinically relevant differences based on age.

Also,  with  regard  to  gender,  although  there  are  2-fold  differences  in  the  frequencies  of  individual TEAEs between males and females in the azacitidine group, there does not appear to be any clinically relevant differences based on gender.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No drug interaction studies have been performed.

-  Discontinuation due to adverse events

In  Study  AZA-001,  the  overall  percentage  of  patients  with  a  TEAE  leading  to  discontinuation  of azacitidine and BSC were 12.6% (22/175) and 3.9% (4/102) respectively. In the CALGB studies, the overall  percentage  ranged  from  18.0  to  31.3%.  In  the  MDS  studies,  the  most  common  reason  for discontinuation of azacitidine was due to haematological TEAEs (occurring in &lt; 5% of patients). In Study AZA-001,  no  patient discontinued study treatment due to any of the  common  non haematological toxicities (i.e., nausea/vomiting or injection site reactions).

Treatment was not discontinued in any patient in clinical pharmacology study.

-  Post-marketing experience

From  a  review  on  data  from  other  additional  clinical  studies,  from  compassionate-use,  from post-marketing data, most frequently reported AE were haematological (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia),  gastrointestinal  events  (nausea,  vomiting,  constipation,  diarrhoea) and injection site reactions (erythema, pain, bruising).

Most  often  causes  of  death  were  due  to  haematological  toxicity,  infectious  complications  and bleeding.

Hepatic and renal adverse events were reported infrequently. However, based on early investigations with azacitidine  in  combination  with  other  cytotoxic  agents  or  at  higher  doses,  renal  abnormalities, including elevated serum creatinine, renal tubular acidosis and renal failure were reported. Published reports also described an association between azacitidine and hepatic fatal failure in patients with solid tumours and hepatic metastasis, especially those with albumin &lt; 30 g/l.

##  Discussion on clinical safety

Vidaza treatment should be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of chemotherapeutic agents. Patients should be premedicated with anti-emetics for nausea and vomiting.

Vidaza is contraindicated in the following situations: Known hypersensitivity to the active substance or  to  any  of  the  excipients,  advanced  malignant hepatic tumours (see SPC section 4.4), or lactation (see SPC section 4.6).

Adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of Vidaza have occurred  in  97  %  of  patients.  The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  reactions  with  azacitidine treatment  were  haematological  reactions  (71.4  %)  including  thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia  and leukopenia (usually Grade 3-4), gastrointestinal events (60.6 %) including nausea, vomiting (usually Grade 1-2) or injection site reactions (77.1 %; usually Grade 1-2).

The most common serious adverse reactions (&gt; 2 %) noted from the pivotal study (AZA PH GL 2003 CL  001)  and  also  reported  in  the  supporting  studies  (CALGB  9221  and  CALGB  8921)  included febrile  neutropenia  (8.0  %)  and  anaemia  (2.3  %).  Other  less  frequently  reported  serious  adverse reactions (&lt; 2 %) included neutropenic sepsis, pneumonia, thrombocytopenia and haemorrhagic events (e.g. cerebral haemorrhage).

## Haematologic adverse reactions

The most commonly  reported adverse reactions associated with azacitidine treatment were haematological including thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and leukopenia, and were usually Grade 3 or 4. There is a greater risk of these events occurring during the first 2 cycles, after which they occur with less  frequency in patients with restoration of haematological function. Most haematological adverse reactions  were  managed  by  routine  monitoring  of  complete  blood  counts  and  delaying  azacitidine administration in the next cycle, prophylactic antibiotics and/or growth factor support (e.g. G-CSF) for neutropenia and transfusions for anaemia or thromobocytopenia as required.

## Infections

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Myelosuppression  may  lead  to  neutropenia  and  an  increased  risk  of  infection.  Serious  adverse reactions  such  as  neutropenic  sepsis  (0.8  %)  and  pneumonia  (2.5  %)  were  reported  in  patients receiving  azacitidine.  Infections  may  be  managed  with  the  use  of  anti-infectives  plus  growth  factor support (e.g. G-CSF) for neutropenia.

## Bleeding

Bleeding may  occur with patients receiving azacitidine. Serious adverse reactions such as gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  (0.8  %)  and  intracranial  haemorrhage  (0.5  %)  have  been  reported. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding, particularly those with pre-existing or treatment-related thrombocytopenia.

## Hypersensitivity

Serious  hypersensitivity  reactions  (0.25  %)  have  been  reported  in  patients  receiving  azacitidine.  In case of an anaphylactic-like reaction, treatment with azacitidine should be immediately discontinued and  appropriate  symptomatic  treatment  initiated.  The  majority  of  skin  and  subcutaneous  adverse reactions were associated with the injection site. None of these adverse reactions led to temporary or permanent discontinuation of azacitidine,  or  reduction  of  azacitidine  dose  in  the  pivotal  study.  The majority of adverse reactions occurred during the first 2 cycles and tended to decrease with subsequent cycles.  Subcutaneous  adverse  reactions  such  as  injection  site  rash/inflammation/pruritus,  rash, erythema  and  skin  lesion  may  require  management  with  concomitant  medicinal  products,  such  as antihistamines, corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

## Gastrointestinal adverse reactions

The most commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions associated with azacitidine treatment included  constipation,  diarrhoea,  nausea  and  vomiting.  These  adverse  reactions  were  managed symptomatically  with  anti-emetics  for  nausea  and  vomiting;  antidiarrhoeals  for  diarrhoea,  and laxatives and/or stool softeners for constipation.

## Overdose

One  case  of  overdose  with  azacitidine  was  reported  during  clinical  trials.  A  patient  experienced diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting after receiving a single intravenous dose of approximately 290 mg/m 2 , almost  4  times  the  recommended  starting  dose.  In  the  event  of  overdose,  the  patient  should  be monitored with appropriate blood counts and should receive supportive treatment, as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for azacitidine overdose.

## Special Populations

Renal impairment: No formal studies have been conducted in patients with decreased renal function. Patients with severe organ impairment should be carefully monitored for adverse events. No specific modification  to  the  starting  dose  is  recommended  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  (e.g.  baseline serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen [BUN] ≥ 2-fold above upper limit of normal [ULN] or serum bicarbonate less than 20 mmol/l) prior to starting treatment; subsequent dose modifications should be based  on  haematology  and  renal  laboratory  values.  If  unexplained  reductions  in  serum  bicarbonate levels  to  less  than  20  mmol/l  occur,  the  dose  should  be  reduced  by  50  %  on  the  next  cycle.  If unexplained elevations in serum creatinine or BUN to ≥ 2-fold above baseline values and above ULN occur, the next cycle should be delayed until values return to normal or baseline and the dose should be reduced by 50 % on the next treatment cycle (see SPC section 4.4).

Renal abnormalities ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death were reported rarely  in  patients  treated  with  intravenous  azacitidine  in  combination  with  other  chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to &lt; 20 mmol/l in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalaemia (serum potassium &lt; 3 mmol/l) developed in 5 subjects with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) treated with azacitidine and etoposide.

Patients  with  renal  impairment  should  be  closely  monitored  for  toxicity  since  azacitidine  and/or  its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney (see SPC section 4.2).

Hepatic impairment: No formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment (see SPC section 4.4).  Patients  with  severe  hepatic  organ  impairment  should  be  carefully  monitored  for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adverse events. No specific modification to the starting dose is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment prior to starting treatment; subsequent dose modifications should be based on haematology laboratory values. Patients with extensive tumour burden due to metastatic disease have been rarely reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such  patients  with  baseline  serum  albumin  &lt;  30  g/l.  Vidaza  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with advanced malignant hepatic tumours (see SPC sections 4.3 and 4.4).

Elderly: No specific dose adjustments are recommended for the elderly. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function.

Children  and  adolescents: Vidaza  is  not  recommended  for  use  in  children  below  18  years  due  to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.

## Laboratory tests

Liver function tests and serum creatinine should be determined prior to initiation of therapy and prior to each treatment cycle. Complete blood counts should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and as needed to monitor response and toxicity, but at a minimum, prior to each treatment cycle .

## Method of administration

Reconstituted Vidaza should be injected subcutaneously into the upper arm, thigh or abdomen.

Injection sites should be rotated. New injections should be given at least 2.5 cm from the previous site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hardened.

## Haematological toxicity

Treatment with azacitidine is associated with anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, particularly during the first 2 cycles (see SPC section 4.8). Complete blood counts should be performed as needed to monitor response and toxicity, but at least prior to each treatment cycle . After administration of the recommended  dose  for  the  first  cycle,  the  dose  for  subsequent  cycles  should  be  reduced  or  its administration  delayed  based  on  nadir  counts  and  haematological  response  (see  SPC  section  4.2). Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes. Patients and physicians are also advised to be observant for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

## Cardiac and pulmonary disease

Patients  with  a  history  of  severe  congestive  heart  failure,  clinically  unstable  cardiac  disease  or pulmonary disease were excluded from the pivotal clinical study and therefore the safety and efficacy of Vidaza in these patients has not been established.

## Pregnancy

There are no adequate data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Studies in mice have shown reproductive  toxicity  (see  SPC  section  5.3).  The  potential  risk  for  humans  is  unknown.  Based  on results  from  animal  studies  and  its  mechanism  of  action,  azacitidine  should  not  be  used  during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, unless clearly necessary. The advantages of treatment should be weighed against the possible risk for the foetus in every individual case. Men and women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment.

## Lactation

It is not known whether azacitidine or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Due to the potential serious  adverse  reactions  in  the  nursing  child,  breast-feeding  is  contraindicated  during  azacitidine therapy.

## Fertility

There  are  no  human  data  on  the  effect  of  azacitidine  on  fertility.  In  animals,  adverse  effects  of azacitidine on male fertility have been documented (see SPC section 5.3). Men should be advised not to  father  a  child  while  receiving  treatment  and  must  use  effective  contraception  during  and  up  to 3 months after treatment. Before starting treatment, male patients should be advised to seek counseling on sperm storage.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Patients should be advised that they may experience undesirable effects such as fatigue, during treatment. Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or operating machines.

Adequate special precautions for disposal and other handling are provided in the SPC (see section 6)

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are no unresolved quality issues which might have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Azacitidine  induces  both  gene  mutations  and  chromosomal  aberrations  in  bacterial  and  mammalian cell  systems  in  vitro.  The  potential  carcinogenicity  of  azacitidine  was  evaluated  in  mice  and  rats. Azacitidine  induced  tumours  of  the  haematopoietic  system  in  female  mice,  when  administered intraperitoneally  3  times  per  week  for  52  weeks.  An  increased  incidence  of  tumours  in  the lymphoreticular  system,  lung,  mammary  gland,  and  skin  was  seen  in  mice  treated  with  azacitidine administered  intraperitoneally  for  50  weeks.  A  tumorigenicity  study  in  rats  revealed  an  increased incidence of testicular tumours.

Early  embryotoxicity  studies  in  mice  revealed  a  44  %  frequency  of  intrauterine  embryonal  death (increased resorption) after a single intraperitoneal injection of azacitidine during organogenesis.

Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before closure of the hard palate. In rats, azacitidine caused no adverse effects when given pre-implantation, but it was clearly embryotoxic during when given during organogenesis. Foetal abnormalities caused during organogenesis included: CNS  anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly) and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, oedema, and rib abnormalities).

Administration  of  azacitidine  to  male  mice  prior  to  mating  with  untreated  female  mice  resulted  in decreased  fertility  and  loss  of  offspring  during  subsequent  embryonic  and  postnatal  development. Treatment of male rats resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, decreased sperm counts, decreased pregnancy rates, an increase in abnormal embryos and increased loss of embryos in mated females (see SPC section 4.4).

## Efficacy

The clinical efficacy of Vidaza was studied  in a multicenter randomised Phase 3 comparative study. Azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) (n = 179) was compared to conventional care regimens (CCR). CCR consisted of BSC alone (n = 105), low-dose cytarabine plus BSC (n = 49) or standard induction chemotherapy plus BSC (n = 25). The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. Vidaza was administered at a subcutaneous (s.c.) dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days, followed by a rest period of 21 days (28-day treatment cycle) for a median of 9 cycles (range = 1-39) and a mean of 10.2 cycles.  In  the  ITT  analysis  of  358  patients  (179  azacitidine  and  179  CCR),  Vidaza  treatment  was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

associated  with  a  median  survival  of  24.46  months versus 15.02  months  for  those  receiving  CCR treatment, a difference of 9.4 months, with a stratified log-rank p-value of 0.0001. The hazard ratio for the  treatment  effect  was  0.58  (95  %  CI:  0.43,  0.77).  The  two-year  survival  rates  were  50.8  %  in patients receiving azacitidine versus 26.2 % in patients receiving CCR (p &lt; 0.0001).

## Safety

Adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of Vidaza have occurred in 97 % of patients.

The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  reactions  with  azacitidine  treatment  were  haematological reactions  (71.4  %)  including  thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia  and  leukopenia  (usually  Grade  3-4), gastrointestinal  events  (60.6  %)  including  nausea,  vomiting  (usually  Grade  1-2)  or  injection  site reactions (77.1 %; usually Grade 1-2).

The most common serious adverse reactions (&gt; 2 %) noted from the pivotal study (AZA PH GL 2003 CL  001)  and  also  reported  in  the  supporting  studies  (CALGB  9221  and  CALGB  8921)  included febrile  neutropenia  (8.0  %)  and  anaemia  (2.3  %).  Other  less  frequently  reported  serious  adverse reactions (&lt; 2 %) included neutropenic sepsis, pneumonia, thrombocytopenia and haemorrhagic events (e.g. cerebral haemorrhage).

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion  that  routine  pharmacovigilance  was  adequate  to  monitor  the  safety  of  the  product.  No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

##  User consultation

The  Patient  Information  Leaflet  (PIL)  for  Vidaza  (azacitidine)  has  been  tested  in  English  in accordance  with  Articles  59(3)  and  61(1)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended  by  Directive 2004/27/EC. The PIL for Vidaza (azacitidine) was found to contain all the necessary information in a way that is accessible and understandable to those who participated in this test.

It is considered that the tested PIL meets the requirements set for User Testing.

## Risk-benefit assessment

The present assessment of the MAA of azacitidine for the proposed indications in MDS and AML was based on the pivotal study AZA-001 in addition to the earlier submitted CALGB studies.

The  design  of  pivotal  study  AZA-001  was  considered  appropriate  to  investigate  the  benefits  of azacitidine  for  the  currently  proposed  indications:  patients  with  intermediate-2  or  high  risk  MDS, CMML (according  to  IPSS)  and  AML  with  20%-30%  blasts  and  multilineage  dysplasia  (WHO). Overall results from the AZA-001 study showed that patients in the azacitidine arm, when compared with patients with similar clinical characteristics that were treated with currently appropriate therapy, had  a  survival  benefit.  Therefore,  the  primary  endpoint  was  met  and  the  difference  in  OS  can  be regarded clinically relevant. The results regarding the secondary endpoints are in line with the survival benefit.  The  safety  profile  of  azacitidine  is  considered  acceptable.    The  toxicity  of  azacitidine  is consistent  with  that  observed  in  general  from  a  cytidine  analogue,  an  antimetabolite.  The  most prominent toxicity consisted of myelotoxicity which translated into symptomatic anaemia and, more important,  leucopenia  and  thrombocytopenia.  In  conclusion,  the  efficacy  of  azacitidine  can  be considered established and the safety profile is acceptable in the claimed indication, and the CHMP considers that the benefit risk balance is positive.

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP is of the opinion that Vidaza is not similar to Trisenox or Glivec within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Vidaza    for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  who  are  not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation with: intermediate-2 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) with 10-29 % marrow blasts without myeloproliferative disorder,  or  acute  myeloid  leukaemia  (AML)  with  20-30  %  blasts  and  multi-lineage  dysplasia, according  to  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO)  classification,  was  favourable  and  therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
