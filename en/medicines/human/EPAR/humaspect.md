## Overview

On 25 September 1998, the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation for HumaSPECT (votumumab) for the whole European Union to Organon Teknika. The marketing authorisation was subsequently transferred to KS Biomedix Ltd. HumaSPECT is indicated in patients with histologically proven carcinoma of the colon or rectum for imaging of recurrence and/or metastases.

HumaSPECT is not marketed anywhere in the world. On 22 September 2003, KS Biomedix Ltd notified the European Commission of its decision not to renew the marketing authorisation for HumaSPECT for commercial reasons. Alternatives are available in Europe, since other radiopharmaceutical agents are used for this indication.

On 24 September 2003, the marketing authorisation for HumaSPECT expired. Consequently, the European Public Assessment Report for HumaSPECT has been removed from this website.
