## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Winlevi 10 mg/g cream

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each gram of cream contains 10 mg of clascoterone.

Excipients with known effect

Each gram of cream contains 25 mg of cetyl alcohol and 250 mg of propylene glycol (E1520).

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Cream

White to almost white cream.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Adults

Winlevi is indicated for the treatment of acne vulgaris.

Adolescents (from 12 to &lt; 18 years of age)

Winlevi is indicated for the treatment of facial acne vulgaris.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of acne vulgaris.

## Posology

A thin uniform layer of cream should be applied to the affected area twice a day, in the morning and the evening, with at least eight hours between applications.

Two (2) fingertip units of cream (corresponding to approximately 1 g of cream) will cover an area of about 28 x 22 cm (approximately 600 cm 2 of skin, corresponding to the average surface area of the face).

Adults

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Total daily dose should not exceed ten (10) fingertip units (corresponding to approximately 5 g of 10 mg/g clascoterone cream). The cream can be applied on the face, chest and/or back.

## Adolescents (from 12 to &lt; 18 years of age)

Total daily dose should not exceed four (4) fingertip units (corresponding to approximately 2 g of 10 mg/g clascoterone cream). The cream must be applied on the face only. No more than 60 g a month should be used (corresponding to one 60 g tube or two 30 g tubes).

For adults and adolescents, to achieve the therapeutic effect, it is recommended to treat for three months. After three months of treatment, it is recommended that the physician evaluates the continued improvement of the patient. Thereafter, regular assessment every three months of the skin and of the status of the patient should determine if continued use of the product is needed taking into account the status of the disease and the safety profile of the treatment.

In adolescents, the physician may decide to conduct the first evaluation visit earlier than three months, depending on the patient's adherence to treatment and/or safety considerations (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

## Renal or hepatic impairment

No studies have been conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Given the very low systemic absorption, no dose adjustment or special considerations are anticipated for these patients (see section 5.2).

## Elderly

There are no clinical data in patients aged 65 years or older. Winlevi is not recommended for use in patients aged 65 years or older.

## Paediatric population

## Children from 9 to &lt; 12 years

The safety and efficacy of Winlevi in children aged 9 to &lt; 12 years old has not been established. Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made.

## Children below 9 years of age

There is no relevant use of Winlevi in children aged less than 9 years for the treatment of acne vulgaris.

## Method of administration

## Winlevi is for cutaneous use only.

The affected areas should be clean and dry before application. Winlevi should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. The cream must be applied without using occlusive dressing to avoid an increased risk for systemic undesirable effects (see section 4.4).

Other cutaneous medicinal products used to treat other conditions on the same skin areas should be applied with a minimum of two (2) hours before or after the application of Winlevi. This is also applicable to the use of sunscreen or emollients.

The patient should be instructed to apply a thin, uniform layer of Winlevi to the affected area, massaging gently, avoiding the eyes, eyelids, lips and nostrils, and then wash hands after application.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The cream must be applied to the entire affected area and not to the acne lesions only.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Pregnancy (see section 4.6).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression

In a dedicated phase 2 clinical study in adults and adolescents from 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, signs of HPA-axis suppression were limited to a laboratory-based assessment (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] stimulated cortisol levels, see section 5.1); no other clinical signs, symptoms or related endocrine adverse reactions were associated with such laboratory results. This laboratory-based evidence of HPA-axis suppression self-resolved without sequelae after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.8).

Conditions which augment systemic absorption (e.g. use over large surfaces, prolonged use, and the use of occlusive dressings), should be avoided (see section 4.2).

Typical symptoms of HPA-axis suppression include fatigue, weight loss, decreased appetite, low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, or abdominal pain (see section 4.8). Patients should be instructed to inform their physician if they develop any symptoms of HPA-axis suppression. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, morning serum cortisol levels could be measured and the patient may be referred for endocrinological evaluation; treatment should be interrupted if HPA axis suppression is confirmed.

## Adolescents (from 12 to &lt; 18 years of age)

The paediatric population may be at increased risk of HPA axis suppression. In the dedicated phase 2 study assessing the potential of clascoterone cream to cause HPA axis suppression, laboratory-based evidence of HPA axis suppression was more frequently observed in adolescents than in adults (see section 5.1). In order to reduce the systemic absorption, use in adolescents must be limited to the face only (see section 4.2).

## Local skin reactions

This medicinal product may induce local irritation (such as erythema, pruritus, scaling/dryness, stinging/burning), mostly of minimal or mild severity (see section 4.8). Caution should be used when applying to sensitive areas of the skin, such as the neck: if a local skin reaction in a sensitive area occurs, treatment discontinuation should be considered; emollients may also be applied with a minimum of two (2) hours before or after the application of this medicinal product (see section 4.2).

Local irritation could be increased in case of concomitant use of cutaneous anti-acneic medicinal products. Concomitant therapy with other anti-acneic cutaneous treatments and other products (i.e. medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime) should be used with caution, applied with a minimum of two (2) hours before or after the application of this medicinal product.

Application to abraded, eczematous skin or patients with inflammatory skin conditions that may coexist with acne, e.g. rosacea or perioral dermatitis, should be avoided.

The concomitant application of astringent cleansing cosmetic products and drying or irritating agents (such as perfumed or alcohol-containing products) should be avoided.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In patients, whose skin has been subjected to procedures such as depilation, chemical peels, dermabrasion or laser resurfacing, the skin should be allowed to recover before application is considered.

Concomitant use with photodynamic therapy is not recommended. Treatment with this medicinal product should be discontinued prior to initiating photodynamic therapy.

## Accidental exposure to mucous membranes

Accidental transfer of cream into eyes, mouth or other mucous membranes should be avoided. If contact with mucous membranes occurs, the area should be rinsed thoroughly with water.

## Rebound effect

The rebound effect (i.e., an exacerbation of acne vulgaris) following treatment withdrawal was not assessed during the clinical studies. Rebound effect was reported for compounds structurally related to clascoterone (i.e., topical corticosteroids) and cannot be excluded for this medicinal product. Should there be a reoccurrence of acne vulgaris within days to weeks after successful treatment of the condition with this medicinal product, a withdrawal reaction should be suspected. Reapplication should be done with caution and medical advice is recommended in these cases, or other treatment options should be considered.

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential have to use an effective contraceptive method during treatment and for at least 10 days after the last dose (see section 4.6). The pregnancy status should be verified before initiating treatment with this medicinal product in women of childbearing potential (see section 4.6).

## Educational materials

Educational materials regarding these precautions are available for healthcare professionals and patients (or parents/caregivers). A patient card is provided with the package of this medicinal product.

## Excipients with known effect

## Cetyl alcohol

This medicinal product contains 25 mg cetyl alcohol in each gram. Cetyl alcohol may cause local skin reactions (e.g. contact dermatitis).

## Propylene glycol

This medicinal product also contains 250 mg propylene glycol in each gram. Propylene glycol may cause skin irritation.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction clinical studies have been performed. The use of clascoterone cream at the same time as other cutaneous medicinal products has not been evaluated (see section 4.2).

Since the systemic exposure of clascoterone and its main metabolite cortexolone following cutaneous application is negligible, no interaction with systemic treatments is expected; however caution is advised in concomitant use with glucocorticoid medicinal products.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Women of childbearing potential have to use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for at least 10 days after the last dose.

No interaction clinical studies have been performed, therefore, an interaction with hormonal contraception cannot be excluded. The pregnancy status should be verified before initiating treatment with clascoterone in women of childbearing potential.

## Pregnancy

There are no or a limited amount of data from the use of cutaneous clascoterone in pregnant women. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity following subcutaneous administration (see section 5.3). Although systemic absorption of cutaneous clascoterone and its main metabolite cortexolone, is negligible, there could be individual factors (e.g. use over large surfaces, prolonged use) that may contribute to an increased systemic exposure. Based on animals studies and its mechanism of action (androgen receptor inhibition), clascoterone can cause fetal harm. This medicinal product is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3).

The patient must be informed and understand the risks related to the use of this medicinal product during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether clascoterone/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.

Use of this medicinal product is not recommended while breast-feeding or breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with this medicinal product.

## Fertility

There are no data on the effect of clascoterone on human fertility. Results from animal studies following subcutaneous administration showed no effect on fertility in male or female rats (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Winlevi has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are local skin reactions such as erythema (11.5%), scaling/dryness (10.0%), pruritus (7.4%) and stinging/burning (4.0%). These reactions were usually self-limiting and resolved during use of this medicinal product.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions reported with cutaneous clascoterone in both adult and adolescent (from 12 to &lt; 18 years of age) patients, including clinical trials and post-marketing experience, are presented in Table 1 below, according to the MedDRA system organ classification.

The frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: v ery common ≥ 1/10; c ommon ≥ 1/100 and to &lt; 1/10; u ncommon ≥ 1/1 000 and to &lt; 1/100; r are ≥ 1/10 000 and to &lt; 1/1 000; very rare &lt; 1/10 000; not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## ACTH stimulation test abnormal

Laboratory evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression(i.e., decreased serum cortisol levels at 30 minutes after ACTH stimulation) was observed in the dedicated phase 2 study in 1/20 (5%) of adult and in 2/22 (9%) of adolescent patients under maximal usage conditions to the entire face, shoulders, upper chest and upper back of acne patients, corresponding to mean daily amounts of 11.3 g (adults) and 9.3 g (adolescents). No clinical signs or symptoms of adrenal suppression were observed. Upon discontinuation of treatment the laboratory test results normalised within 4 weeks (see section 4.4).

If HPA axis suppression occurs, treatment interruption should be considered (see section 4.4).

## Paediatric population

Among the 444 subjects aged 12 to &lt; 18 years enrolled in phase 2 and phase 3 vehicle-controlled studies for acne vulgaris and exposed to clascoterone cream, the overall incidence of adverse reactions was 4/444 (0.9%).

Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions through week 12 were similar to those in adults as presented in Table 1, which covers both populations.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no specific treatment for an overdose with Winlevi.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the dedicated phase 2 clinical study, a mean daily amount of 11.3 g and 9.3 g clascoterone cream 10 mg/g was administered for 2 weeks to 20 adult and 22 adolescent patients, respectively, resulting in laboratory-based HPA axis suppression in 5% of adults and 9% of adolescents respectively.

In the event of overdose, Winlevi should be discontinued and the patient monitored for potential occurrence of HPA axis suppression signs and symptoms.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-acne preparations, other anti-acne preparations for topical use, ATC code: D10AX06

## Mechanism of action

Clascoterone is an androgen receptor inhibitor. In vitro studies showed that it potently antagonizes the effects of androgens in primary human sebocytes to reduce sebum production and accumulation and inflammatory mediators which are known drivers of the acne pathogenesis.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression

In the dedicated phase 2 study 171-7151-202 aimed at investigating the potential effects of clascoterone cream 10 mg/g on the HPA axis and pharmacokinetics in adults and adolescents with acne vulgaris, HPA axis suppression was evaluated in adults (n=20) and adolescents from 12 years of age (n=22) following application of supratherapeutical doses of clascoterone cream with a mean daily amount of 11.3 g in adults and 9.3 g in adolescents for 2 weeks (see section 5.2). HPA axis suppression indicated by 30-minute poststimulation serum cortisol level of ≤ 18 mcg/dL was observed in 1/20 (5%) of adult subjects and 2/22 (9%) of adolescent subjects at Day 14. All subjects returned to normal HPA axis function at follow-up 4 weeks after the end of treatment.

## Cardiac electrophysiology

At approximately 9-times the maximum treatment adult dose (5 g/day of cream), clascoterone does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The safety and efficacy of clascoterone cream 10 mg/g applied twice daily for 12 weeks for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in two identically-designed phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials (CB-03-01/25 and CB-03-01/26) enrolling in total 1 440 subjects with facial acne vulgaris. The trials enrolled subjects with Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) of moderate or severe facial acne vulgaris (score of 3 or 4), 30 to 75 inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules and nodules), and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones).

Of these 1 440 randomised subjects, 19 (1.3%) were 9 to 11 years of age, 641 (44.5%) were 12 to 17 years of age, and 780 (54.2%) were 18 years of age or older. Among adults and adolescents, 62% of the subjects were female and 91% were Caucasian. At baseline, subjects had a mean inflammatory lesion count of 42.4 and a mean non-inflammatory lesion count of 61.4. Approximately 83% of subjects had an IGA score of 3.

Efficacy was assessed by three co-primary endpoints: proportion of subjects in each treatment group achieving 'success' at Week 12, with 'success' defined as an IGA score of ' clear (score=0)' or 'almost clear (score=1)' AND at least a 2-point reduction in IGA compared to baseline, absolute

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

change from baseline in non-inflammatory lesions count (NILC) in each treatment group at Week 12, and absolute change from baseline in inflammatory lesions count (ILC) in each treatment group at Week 12.

Adults and adolescents from 12 to &lt; 18 years

The IGA success rate and mean absolute and percent reduction from baseline in acne lesion counts after 12 weeks of treatment for patients 12 years of age and older are presented in Table 2.

a Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) success was defined as at least a 2-point reduction in IGA compared to baseline and an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear).

Among the 641 subjects aged 12 to &lt; 18 years enrolled in phase 3 vehicle-controlled studies for facial acne vulgaris, 316 and 325 subjects were randomized to clascoterone cream and to vehicle, respectively.

Clascoterone cream was superior to vehicle in all the three co-primary endpoints: in the IGA success rate at Week 12 (14.9% vs 3.7%, respectively; Adjusted Odds Ratio [95% CI]: 4.3 [2.2; 8.4]; p-value: &lt; 0.0001), in the absolute change from baseline in NILC at Week 12 (-17.6 vs -11.4, respectively; LS mean difference [95% CI]: -6.2 [-10.6; -1.9]; p-value: 0.0050) and in the absolute change from baseline in ILC at Week 12 (-17.9 vs -12.5, respectively; LS mean difference [95% CI]: -5.4 [-8.2; 2.7]; p-value: 0.0001).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Children from 9 to &lt; 12 years

Among the 19 subjects aged 9 to 11 years enrolled in phase 3 vehicle-controlled studies for facial acne vulgaris, 13 and 6 subjects were randomized to clascoterone cream and to vehicle, respectively. No statistically significant differences between clascoterone cream and vehicle were seen in any of the three co-primary endpoints: in the IGA success rate at Week 12 (15.4% vs 18.0%, respectively; Adjusted Odds Ratio [95% CI]: 0.8 [0.1; 11.8]; p-value: 0.8903), in the absolute change from baseline in NILC at Week 12 (7.3 vs -23.4, respectively; LS mean difference [95% CI]: 30.8 [-17.9; 79.4]; pvalue: 0.2155) and in the absolute change from baseline in ILC at Week 12 (-20.6 vs -26.3; LS mean difference [95% CI]: 5.7 [-2.5; 13.9]; p-value: 0.1719).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Adults

## Absorption

After repeated cutaneous administrations of 4 g to 12 g daily of clascoterone cream 10 mg/g in healthy adults and in adult patients with acne vulgaris for up to 6 consecutive weeks, the systemic exposure was less than 1% of the total administered dose.

No correlation between blood levels and adverse reactions could be established.

Following cutaneous treatment of clascoterone for 2 weeks with a mean dose of approximately 6 g applied twice daily (12 g/day of cream) to adult subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris (n=20), systemic concentrations of clascoterone were at steady state by Day 5. On Day 14, the mean ± SD maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) was 4.5 ± 2.9 ng/mL, the mean ± SD area under the plasma concentrationtime over the dosing interval (AUCꞇ) was 37.1 ± 22.3 h*ng/mL and the mean ± SD average plasma concentration (Cavg) was 3.1 ± 1.9 ng/mL.

## Distribution

In in vitro studies, plasma protein binding of clascoterone was 84% to 89% and was independent of concentrations.

## Biotransformation

Following cutaneous treatment with clascoterone, the plasma concentrations of cortexolone, the main metabolite of clascoterone, were detectable and generally below or near the lower limit of quantitation (0.5 ng/mL) in subjects with acne vulgaris.

## Elimination

Excretion of clascoterone has not been fully characterised in humans. Because of the relatively low systemic bioavailability of clascoterone, the effects of renal or hepatic impairment were not evaluated.

## Adolescents

In adolescent patients with acne vulgaris aged from 12 to &lt; 18 years (n=22) after 2 weeks of treatment with a mean dose of approximately 4 g of clascoterone cream 10 mg/g applied twice daily (8 g/day), steady-state concentrations of clascoterone were achieved by Day 14. Clascoterone systemic exposure was similar to that observed in adult patients treated with 6 g twice daily.

## Elderly

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Clinical studies of clascoterone cream did not include sufficient number of subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.

## In vitro studies

## CYP enzymes

Clascoterone inhibited CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4 with an IC50 value of &gt; 40 µM. Clascoterone up to 30 µM did not induce CYP 1A2, 2B6, or 3A4. These findings suggest that clascoterone has no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of substances metabolised by CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology and repeated dose toxicity studies.

Clascoterone was negative in an in vitro Ames and was aneugenic in an in vitro human lymphocyte micronucleus assay with a threshold of 50 mcg/mL, ˃ 10 000 fold higher than the clinical Cmax reached with supratherapeutic doses.

In vivo , in male rats after double subcutaneous administration up to 2000 mg/kg, clascoterone was clastogenic in the micronucleous test, corresponding to &gt; 100 safety margin calculated on the basis of animal versus clinical Cmax and AUC.

Clascoterone was not carcinogenic after daily topical administration of 0.1, 1 or 5 mg/mL cream (1 mg/g, 10 mg/g, or 50 mg/g) in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats. A statistically significant increase in benign sebaceous cell adenoma at the topical application site was observed only in males treated with the highest concentration of 50 mg/g clascoterone cream. An increased incidence of the non-neoplastic finding of atrophy of the skin and subcutis at the application site was reported in males and females treated with 10 mg/g and 50 mg/g clascoterone cream.

In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, there was no effect on fertility at subcutaneous doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day; increased preimplantation loss and sperm count changes were noted at this dose level but not at 2.5 mg/kg/day (4.7 to 8.0 times the human exposure based on AUC comparison).

In an embryofetal development study conducted in rats at subcutaneous doses of 1, 5, or 25 mg/kg/day, clascoterone-related malformations were noted at all dose levels, without a dose relationship: omphalocele was noted in a single foetus at each dose level, and external and visceral malformations (severe dilation of the lateral and third cerebral ventricles; thin skin, small size, and protruding tongue) were noted in two additional fetuses at 1 mg/kg/day (2.5 times the human exposure based on AUC comparison).

In rabbits, postimplantation loss and resorptions were increased at a subcutaneous dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day whereas no treatment-related effect on embryofetal development was observed at doses up to 0.4 mg/kg/day (3.7 times the human exposure based on AUC). In a pre- and postnatal development study performed in rats, no significant developmental toxicity was observed at subcutaneous doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day.

## Environmental risk assessment (ERA)

Based on its endocrine mechanism of action, clascoterone may pose a risk to compartment(s), in particular the aquatic compartment(s).

## Package leaflet: Information for the patient

## Winlevi 10 mg/g cream clascoterone

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

* Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
* If you have any further questions, ask your doctor.
* This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
* If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Winlevi is and what it is used for

Winlevi contains the active substance clascoterone that belongs to a group of medicines known as 'anti-acne preparations'.

Winlevi cream is a medicine used in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and older to treat acne vulgaris. Acne vulgaris is a common skin condition that causes pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads that can affect the face, chest and back. In adolescents the use must be limited to the face only.

The active susbtance in Winlevi, clascoterone, blocks androgen receptors (a type of protein that binds to hormones called androgens). It also counteracts the effects of androgens in sebaceous glands (small glands in the skin that produce an oily substance called sebum) which improves acne vulgaris.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Winlevi

## Do not use Winlevi

- -if you are allergic to clascoterone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- -if you are pregnant.

## Warnings and precautions

* Talk to your doctor before using Winlevi. Your doctor should start and supervise the treatment.
* Winlevi is for external use only. It should only be applied to the skin.
* Do not use more Winlevi than the prescribed dose.
* Adolescents must apply the cream on the face only.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

* Winlevi can cause irritation (for example, dryness, redness, itching or a stinging/burning sensation). In most cases, this is of minimal or mild severity.
* Use caution when applying to this medicine to sensitive areas of the skin, such as the neck. If a reaction in a sensitive area occurs, your doctor may instruct you to stop treatment. You may also apply emollients at least 2 hours before or after the application of Winlevi.
* Do not apply Winlevi to cuts, abrasions, eczema or on sunburnt skin, or to areas affected by inflammatory skin conditions that may coexist with acne (such as, for example, redness (blushing) across your face or red rash around the mouth).
* Do not use this medicine at the same time as photodynamic therapy. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking this medicine before starting photodynamic therapy.
* Do not cover the affected area with additional dressings or bandages, as this increases the risk of experiencing side effects.
* Avoid using this medicine on skin that has been exposed to other treatments, including cosmetic treatments (such as hair removal, chemical peels, dermabrasion or laser resurfacing), until the skin has recovered.
* Wash your hands after applying the cream.
* Avoid getting this medicine in your eyes, on your lips, mouth or corners of the nose, or on the mucous membranes on the inside of your nose and lips. If cream accidentally gets on these areas, rinse well with water.
* Avoid using this medicine at the same time as other cutaneous acne medicines. Using more than one acne medicine at the same time may cause more irritation. If treatment with more than one acne medicine is required, these should be applied or taken with at least 2 hours before or after the application of Winlevi.
* Avoid using skin products that may dry or irritate your skin.
* You may experience adrenal suppression (reduced activity of the adrenal glands, which produce a stress hormone called cortisol) as an undesirable effect of Winlevi during treatment. If you use Winlevi over large areas of your skin for a long time or if you cover the area with a bandage or dressing, this can increase the risk of developing adrenal suppression. If you develop one or more of the following symptoms, which are otherwise unexplained and do not get better, this may indicate adrenal suppression, and you should contact your doctor right away:
* feeling tired,
* weight loss,
* decreased appetite,
* low blood pressure,
* feeling sick (nausea),
* diarrhoea,
* vomiting,
* belly (abdominal) pain,
* low blood glucose levels (hypoglycaemia),

Your doctor could consider to test your blood cortisol levels and refer you to endocrinologist evaluation in the presence of signs or symptoms suggestive of adrenal suppression.

* Your doctor will monitor your condition and may stop or change the treatment if necessary. Regular follow-up is important, especially during long-term use.

If you experience a reoccurrence (worsening) of acne in previously treated areas within days to weeks from treatment interruption, this may represent an exacerbation of acne due to the product (rebound). Do not re-treat the area without consulting a doctor.

If you are not sure about any of the warnings and precautions, you should discuss with your doctor.

## Children and adolescents

This medicine is only for use in adolescents 12 years and over. Do not give this medicine to children under 12 years because no benefit of the medicine was seen in this age group.

## Other medicines and Winlevi

Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.

Winlevi may harm an unborn baby. If you're pregnant, do not use Winlevi. If you could become pregnant, you have to use effective contraception (birth control) while using Winlevi and for at least 10 days after stopping the treatment. You should talk to your doctor about which contraception method is right for you while you are taking Winlevi.

Your pregnancy status should be verified before starting the treatment.

It is not known if the active substance in Winlevi, clascoterone, or its by-products can be passed into breast milk. This means there may be a risk to the baby if you use Winlevi while breast-feeding. You should stop breast-feeding during treatment.

A patient card is provided with the Winlevi package to remind you of clascoterone risks in pregnancy.

Winlevi has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## Winlevi contains cetyl alcohol.

Cetyl alcohol may cause local skin reactions (e.g. contact dermatitis).

## Winlevi contains propylene glycol.

Propylene glycol may cause skin irritation. Because this medicine contains propylene glycol, do not use it on open wounds or large areas of broken or damaged skin (such as burns).

## 3. How to use Winlevi

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not sure.

A thin and even layer of the cream should be applied twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. Adolescents must apply the cream on the face only. Ensure that you wait at least 8 hours between each application.

Before applying this cream, gently wash and dry the affected skin area. Apply a thin, even layer of cream to the affected area, massaging gently. Two (2) fingertip units of cream (which correspond to about 1 g) will cover an area of about 28 x 22 cm (approximately 600 cm 2 ) that corresponds to the average surface area of the face. A fingertip unit is the amount of cream squeezed out from a tube along the length of an adult's index finger, from the first finger crease to the tip. One fingertip unit dose is about 0.5 g of cream.

The cream must be applied to the entire affected area, and not to the acne lesions only.

Avoid applying the cream to the eyes, eyelids, lips and nostrils. Wash your hands after applying the cream. Do not cover the affected area with additional dressings or bandages, as this increases the risk of experiencing side effects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In adults Winlevi can be applied to the face, chest and/or back. The daily dose should not exceed 10 fingertip units (about 5 g).

In adolescents Winlevi must be applied to the face only. The daily dose should not exceed 4 fingertip units (about 2 g). No more than one 60 g a month (corresponding to one 60 g tube or two 30 g tubes) should be used.

Apply other skin medicines or cosmetic products, such as moisturisers or sunscreens, with a minimum gap of 2 hours before or after you use Winlevi.

Your doctor will tell you how long you will need to use Winlevi. After three months of treatment, your doctor may need to assess if or how much your acne has improved. After that, your doctor will reassess regularly (every three months) if you should continue treatment.

If you are an adolescent, your doctor may decide to schedule a visit earlier than three months.

## If you use more Winlevi than you should

If you use Winlevi over large areas of your skin for a long time or if you cover the area with a bandage or dressing, this can increase the risk of developing side effects including adrenal suppression (see sections 2 and 4).

## If you forget to use Winlevi

Wait for at least eight (8) hours between applications.

Do not apply a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.
