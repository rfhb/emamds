1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| A31/0078  | Pursuant to Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC, Germany initiated a procedure on 6 July 2016 based on concerns resulting from the evaluation of data from pharmacovigilance activities. The PRAC was requested to assess the potential impact of the results of the SIPPET study (which concluded that recombinant factor VIII medicines had a higher incidence of inhibitor development than plasma-derived medicines), and to issue a recommendation as to whether the marketing authorisations of these products should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. The EMA | 14/09/2017   | 24/11/2017 | SmPC and PL | Please refer to the assessment report: human coagulation factor VIII - EMEA/H/A-31/1448 |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

|           | concluded in September 2017 that there is no clear and consistent evidence of a difference in the incidence of inhibitor development between the two classes of factor VIII medicines: those derived from plasma and those made by recombinant DNA technology. Due to the different characteristics of individual products within the two classes, EMA concluded that the risk of inhibitor development should be evaluated individually for each medicine, regardless of class. The risk for each product will continue to be assessed as more evidence becomes available.                                                                                                 |            |     |

It was first approved in the EU in the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) on 02 March 2004 and renewed on 26 February 2009. This is the 2nd renewal of the Marketing Authorisation for Advate. An overview of the knowledge and information submitted related to the quality, safety and efficacy aspects of the product reconfirmed the positive benefit- risk ration in the approved indication. The risk management plan is in place and is considered acceptable. The CHMP considers that the renewal can be granted with unlimited validity. |

| II/0004   | Extension of Indication                                                    | 18/11/2004   | 21/12/2004   | SmPC, Labelling and PL | Introduction In this variation the MAH presented additional data from a phase 2/3 study (protocol 060101) on pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, efficacy and safety in the use of Advate in previously treated paediatric patients (PTPs) with haemophilia A. Based on the data analysed the MAH sought an extension of the existing clinical indication to include children under the age of 6 and proposed to delete the following sentence \"Currently there are insufficient data in children less than 6 years of age to recommend the use of ADVATE.\" in section 4.2 of the SPC and corresponding changes in the PL. Further, the MAH proposed to amend sections 4.8 and 5.2 of the SPC. Consequential changes have been introduced in the PL. The MAH also took this opportunity to bring Annex III in line with the latest QRD template. Description of study 060101 This is an ongoing, multi-centre, open-label, prospective, uncontrolled clinical study of at least 50 paediatric PTPs under 6 years of age with severe or moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII = 2%). |

Subjects are to continue to receive Advate for at least 50 exposure days or a total treatment time of 6 months, whichever comes first. The treatment regimen is determined by the site investigator (i.e., standard prophylaxis [25 to 50 IU/kg, 3 to 4 times per week], modified prophylaxis, or on-demand treatment). Results and discussion Over the 18-month period covered by the interim report, 53 paediatric PTPs < 6 years of age were given a single infusion of Advate in Part 1 of this study for the determination of pharmacokinetic and safety data parameters. Forty of these subjects have been seen for at   |
