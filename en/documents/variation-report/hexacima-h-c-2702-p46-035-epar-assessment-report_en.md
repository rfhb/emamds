## 1. Introduction

On 14 November 2019, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study MET57 for Hexaxim/ Hexacima/Hexyon, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that MET57, Immunogenicity and Safety of an Investigational Quadrivalent Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine Administered Concomitantly with Other Paediatric Vaccines in Healthy Toddlers is a standalone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

South Korea and Thailand: MenACYW conjugate vaccine + measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) + varicella (V)

Mexico: MenACYW conjugate vaccine + diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type-b (DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib)

Russian Federation: MenACYW conjugate vaccine + pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13)

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## Introduction

Hexaxim/Hexacima/Hexyon is indicated for active immunisation (primary and booster vaccination) of infants and toddlers from six weeks to 24 months of age against diphtheria (D), tetanus (T), pertussis, Hepatitis B (Hep B), poliomyelitis and invasive diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib).

The MAH submitted the final report for:

MET57:

'Immunogenicity and safety of an Investigational Quadrivalent Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine administered concomitantly with other pediatric vaccines in healthy toddlers'

(South Korea, Thailand, the Russian Federation, and Mexico)

This study was not conducted as part of the EU-approved Paediatric Investigational Plan for this product (EMEA 001201-PIP01-11-M02).

The primary objective of this study is to describe the immunogenicity profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine administered alone or concomitantly with licensed paediatric vaccine(s) (MMR+V, DTaP-IPVHB-Hib, or PCV13). Due to the study focus on MenACWY only results from the two groups (Groups 4 + 6, in Mexico) receiving Hexacima (licensed in Mexico) will be discussed in detail in this report. A general overview of the study is given below with the information regarding those two groups bolded.

## 2.3.1. Clinical study

## MET57: 'Immunogenicity and safety of an Investigational Quadrivalent Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine administered concomitantly with other pediatric vaccines in healthy toddlers'

## Description

The purpose of MET57 was to demonstrate that the immunogenicity and safety profiles of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine when administered alone in toddlers 12 to 23 months old were comparable to when MenACYW conjugate vaccine was given concomitantly with licensed paediatric vaccine(s) (measles-mumps-rubella [MMR] + varicella [V], diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type-b [DTaPIPV- HB-Hib], or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV13]), and that the immunogenicity and safety of vaccines routinely administered to toddlers were not affected by concomitant administration with MenACYW conjugate vaccine.

## Methods

## Objectives

The primary objective is to describe the immunogenicity profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine administered alone or concomitantly with licensed paediatric vaccine(s) (MMR+V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or PCV13.

The secondary objective is to describe the immunogenicity profile of licensed paediatric vaccine(s) (MMR+V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or PCV13) when administered alone or concomitantly with MenACYW conjugate vaccine.

## Observational Objectives

## Immunogenicity

To describe the Ab responses to the meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W before and 30 days (+14 days) after vaccination with MenACYW conjugated vaccine measured by serum bactericidal assay using baby rabbit complement (rSBA) in all subjects in Group 1 and Group 2 and in a subset of subjects in Group 4, Group 5, Group 7, and Group 8 (100 subjects per group in Groups 1, 4, and 7; 50 subjects per group in Groups 2, 5, and 8) (South Korea, Mexico, and the Russian Federation only).

## Safety

- To describe the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine when administered alone or concomitantly with licensed pediatric vaccine(s) (MMR+V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or PCV13)
- To describe the safety profile of licensed pediatric vaccine(s) (MMR+V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or PCV13) when administered alone or concomitantly with MenACYW conjugate vaccine

## Study design

Phase III, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled, multicentre study.

Two groups out of the 12 of the study have received either MenACYW conjugate vaccine and DTaP IPV HB-Haemophilus influenzae Type b (PRP)~T vaccine (200 subjects), or DTaP IPV HB-PRP~T vaccine alone (100 subjects), at 12 to 23 months of age. This study took place in Mexico.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In South Korea and Mexico, healthy, meningococcal-vaccine naïve toddlers aged 12 to 23 months on the day of enrolment were randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio (by country) to the following groups: Mexico: Group 4: MenACYW conjugate vaccine + DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib on D0 Group 5: MenACYW conjugate vaccine on D0 Group 6: DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib on D0 South Korea: Group 1: MenACYW conjugate vaccine + MMR + V on Day (D) 0 Group 2: MenACYW conjugate vaccine on D0 Group 3: MMR + V on D0 In the Russian Federation, healthy, meningococcal-vaccine naïve toddlers aged 12 to 14 months or 16 to 23 months on the day of enrolment were assigned to Group 8 with a balanced population distribution of half of the subjects aged 12 to 14 months and half of the subjects aged 16 to 23 months. Healthy, meningococcal-vaccine naïve toddlers, who had not received the 3rd dose of PCV13, aged 15 to 23 months on the day of enrolment were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Groups 7 and 9, in order to comply with the National Immunization Calendar of the Russian Federation: The Russian Federation: Group 7: MenACYW conjugate vaccine + PCV13 on D0 Group 8: MenACYW conjugate vaccine on D0 Group 9: PCV13 on D0 (Visit 1) Note about Visits: Visit 0=Screening visit for subjects in the Russian Federation only Visit 1=D0, vaccination visit (all countries) Visit 2=D30 (+14 days), 30 to 44 days after D0 (all countries) In the Russian Federation, Visit 0 and Visit 1 may have taken place on the same day, or Visit 1 may have taken place up to 5 days after Visit 0. In Thailand, healthy, meningococcal-vaccine naïve toddlers aged 12 to 23 months on the day of enrolment were randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to the following groups: Thailand: Group 10: MenACYW conjugate vaccine + MMR + V on D0 Group 11: MenACYW conjugate vaccine on D0 Group 12: MMR + V on D0

## All Subjects:

All subjects were to provide blood samples for immunogenicity assessment at baseline (prevaccination) and at Visit 2 (30 to 44 days after vaccination[s]). Solicited adverse event (AE) information was collected for 7 days after vaccination(s); unsolicited AE information was collected from

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Visit 1 (D0) to Visit 2, and serious adverse event (SAE) information was collected throughout the study period from Visit 1 through Visit 2. Upon completion of all study procedures and termination from the trial at Visit 2, study participants were to receive the remainder of the recommended toddler vaccines, which were part of the respective National Immunization Programs (NIP) for each country, from their health care provider.

Laboratory assays were the same as for the previous studies; analysis was done at the sponsor's laboratory in Swiftwater, USA.

## Statistical Methods

All analyses were descriptive. No hypotheses were tested. All immunogenicity analyses were performed on the Per-Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS). Additional immunogenicity analyses were performed for exploratory purposes on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) according to randomization group. All safety analyses were performed on the Safety Analysis Set (SafAS).

## Immunogenicity

Descriptive statistics were provided for the Ab titers against meningococcal serogroups contained in MenACYW conjugate vaccine and for the antigens contained in the licensed vaccines. In general, categorical variables were summarized and presented by frequency counts, percentages, and CIs. The 95% CIs of point estimates were calculated using the normal approximation for quantitative data and the exact binomial distribution (Clopper- Pearson method) for percentages. For geometric mean titers (GMTs) or geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), 95% CIs of point estimates were calculated using normal approximation assuming they are log-normally distributed.

## For the Primary Objective

The immunogenicity descriptive analyses at least included the following:

Ab titers against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W measured by hSBA before and 30 days after vaccination with MenACYW conjugate vaccine:

- GMT and 95% CI
- Titer distribution and reverse cumulative distribution curve (RCDCs)
- Percentage of subjects wit h titer ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8 and 95% CI
- Percentage of subjects with titer ≥ 4 -fold rise from pre-vaccination to postvaccination, and 95% CI
- Percentage of subjects with hSBA vaccine seroresponse*

* hSBA vaccine seroresponse for serogroups A, C, Y, and W was defined as:

- For a subject with a pre-vaccination titer &lt; 1:8, the postvaccination titer had to be ≥ 1:16.
- For a subject with a prevaccination titer ≥ 1:8, the post -vaccination titer had to be at least 4-fold greater than the pre-vaccination titer.

## For the Secondary Objective

The analyses on the concomitant vaccines included GMTs and titer distribution or GMCs, and RCDCs, as well as percentage of subjects with:

- Abs to the antigens contained in MMR vaccine measured before and 30 days after vaccination with MMR vaccine:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o Anti-measles Ab concentrations ≥ 255 mIU/mL
- o Anti-mumps Ab concentrations ≥ 10 Mumps Ab units/mL
- o Anti-rubella Ab concentrations ≥ 10 IU/mL
- Anti-varicella Ab concentrations before and 30 days after vaccination with V vaccine ≥ 5 glycoprotein (gp) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] Ab units/mL
- Abs to the antigens contained in DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine measured before and 30 days after vaccination with DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine:
- o Anti-tetanus Ab concentrations ≥ 0.01 and 0.1 IU/mL at D0 and ≥ 0.1 and 1.0 IU/mL at D30
- o Anti-pertussis (PT and FHA) Ab concentrations and pertussis vaccine response†
- o Abs to the antigens contained in DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine measured 30 days after vaccination with DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine:
-  Anti-diphtheria Ab concentrations ≥ 0.1 and 1.0 IU/mL
-  Anti-PRP Ab concentrations ≥ 0.15 and 1.0 μ g/mL
-  Anti-poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 Ab titers ≥ 1:8
-  Anti-HBsAg Ab concentrations ≥ 10 and 100 milli-international units (mIU)/mL

## † Pertussis vaccine response:

- If the pre-booster vaccination concentration is &lt; 4 x lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), then the post-booster vaccination concentration is ≥ 4 x the pre-booster concentration;
- If the pre-booster vaccination concentration is ≥ 4 x LLOQ, then the post-booster vaccination concentration is ≥ 2 x the pre-booster concentration.
- Anti-pneumococcal Ab concentrations ≥ 0.35 μ g/mL and 1.0 μ g/mL and 95% CI for serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F measured before and 30 days after vaccination with PCV13 vaccine

## For the Observational Objective

## Immunogenicity

The immunogenicity descriptive analyses included the following:

Ab titers against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W measured by rSBA before and 30 days after vaccination with MenACYW conjugate vaccine:

- GMT and 95% CI
- Titer distribution and RCDCs
- o Percentage of subjects with titer ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:128 and 95% CI
- o Percentage of subjects with titer ≥ 4-fold rise from pre-vaccination to postvaccination, and 95% CI
- Percentage of subjects with rSBA vaccine seroresponse*

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

* rSBA vaccine seroresponse was defined as a post-vaccination titer ≥ 1:32 for subjects with pre-vaccination rSBA titer &lt; 1:8, or a post-vaccination titer ≥ 4 times the prevaccination titer for subjects with pre-vaccination rSBA titer ≥ 1:8.

## Safety

Safety results were described for subjects in all study groups. The main parameters for the safety endpoints were described by 95% CIs (based on the Clopper-Pearson method).

## Results

In the Mexican study groups the children were comparable regarding age and ethnicity. The male/female ratio was also similar in the groups with slightly more male subjects (~53%) in each group.

## Number analysed

A total of 1183 subjects were enrolled in this study and randomly allocated to one of the following groups depending on the country: Group 1 (107 subjects), Group 2 (53 subjects), and Group 3 (53 subjects) in South Korea, Group 4 (200 subjects), Group 5 (100 subjects), and Group 6 (100 subjects) in Mexico, Group 7 (200 subjects), Group 8 (100 subjects), and Group 9 (100 subjects) in the Russian Federation, and Group 10 (86 subjects), Group 11 (42 subjects), and Group 12 (42 subjects) in Thailand.

There were no early terminations due to an SAE (there was a single instance of early termination due to a non-serious AE of gastroenteritis). A total of 1177 (99.5%) subjects received vaccine and all of these subjects received the vaccine as randomized. A total of 1159 (98.0%) subjects completed the trial.

N: mumber of subjects in PPAS

## Assessor's comment:

Serological protection thresholds are reached in all cases and for all antigens of Hexyon regardless of concomitant or staggered use of Hexyon and MenACWY.

GMTs are often slightly higher in the staggered use group (6) but the Polio antibody GMTs are slightly higher in concomitant use. Overall, the results confirm the information already to be found in the Hexyon SmPC.

## Assessor's comment:

Solicited AEs were not more frequent in the concomitant versus staggered groups.

No deaths occurred in this study.

No SAEs related to the vaccines were reported. No (S)AEs led to discontinuation of the study.

Otherwise similar event rates were seen for solicited local and systemic events as already known from other trials with this vaccine.

No safety issues are identified.

The safety profile remains unchanged.

## Discussion on clinical aspects

For both safety and immunogenicity the results of this study confirm the information known and already reflected in the product information.

Overall, this study does not add new information regarding the immunogenicity and safety. The benefit-risk profile remains unchanged.
