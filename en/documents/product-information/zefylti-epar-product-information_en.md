Clear, colourless or slightly yellowish solution.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Zefylti is indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia.

The safety and efficacy of Zefylti are similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Zefylti is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In patients, children or adults, with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of ≤ 0.5 x 10 9 /L, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, long term administration of Zefylti is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the incidence and duration of infection-related events.

Zefylti is indicated for the treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC less than or equal to 1  x  10 9 /L) in patients with advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when other options to manage neutropenia are inappropriate.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Filgrastim therapy should only be given in collaboration with an oncology centre which has experience in granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSFs) treatment and haematology and has the necessary diagnostic facilities. The mobilisation and apheresis procedures should be performed in collaboration with an oncology-haematology centre with acceptable experience in this field and where the monitoring of haematopoietic progenitor cells can be correctly performed.

## Established cytotoxic chemotherapy

## Posology

The recommended dose of filgrastim is 0.5 MU (5 mcg)/kg/day. The first dose of filgrastim should be administered at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy. In randomised clinical trials, a subcutaneous dose of 230 mcg/m 2 /day (4 to 8.4 mcg/kg/day) was used.

Daily dosing with filgrastim should continue until the expected neutrophil nadir is passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to the normal range. Following established chemotherapy for solid tumours, lymphomas, and lymphoid leukaemia, it is expected that the duration of treatment required to fulfil these criteria will be up to 14 days. Following induction and consolidation treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia the duration of treatment may be substantially longer (up to 38 days) depending on the type, dose and schedule of cytotoxic chemotherapy used.

In patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, a transient increase in neutrophil counts is typically seen 1 to 2 days after initiation of filgrastim therapy. However, for a sustained therapeutic response, filgrastim therapy should not be discontinued before the expected nadir has passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to the normal range. Premature discontinuation of filgrastim therapy, prior to the time of the expected neutrophil nadir, is not recommended.

## Method of administration

Filgrastim may be given as a daily subcutaneous injection or as a daily intravenous infusion diluted in 5% glucose solution given over 30 minutes (see section 6.6). The subcutaneous use  is preferred in most cases. There is some evidence from a study of single dose administration that intravenous dosing may shorten the duration of effect. The clinical relevance of this finding to multiple dose administration is not clear. The choice of route should depend on the individual clinical circumstance.

## In patients treated with myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation

## Posology

The recommended starting dose of filgrastim is 1 MU (10 mcg)/kg/day. The first dose of Zefylti should be administered at least 24 hours following cytotoxic chemotherapy and at least 24 hours after bone marrow infusion.

Once the neutrophil nadir has been passed, the daily dose of filgrastim should be titrated against the neutrophil response as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Table 1: daily dose of filgrastim against neutrophil response

## Method of administration

Filgrastim may be given as a 30 minute or 24 hour intravenous infusion or given by continuous 24 hour subcutaneous infusion. Zefylti should be diluted in 20 mL of 5% glucose solution (see section 6.6).

For the mobilisation of PBPCs in patients undergoing myelosuppressive or myeloablative therapy followed by autologous PBPC transplantation

## Posology

The recommended dose of filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation when used alone is 1 MU (10 mcg)/kg/day for 5 to 7 consecutive days. Timing of leukapheresis: one or two leukapheresis on days 5 and 6 are often sufficient. In other circumstances, additional leukapheresis may be necessary. Filgrastim dosing should be maintained until the last leukapheresis.

The recommended dose of filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation after myelosuppressive chemotherapy is 0.5 MU (5 mcg)/kg/day from the first day after completion of chemotherapy until the expected neutrophil nadir is passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to the normal range. Leukapheresis should be performed during the period when the ANC rises from &lt; 0.5 x 10 9 /L to &gt; 5 x 10 9 /L. For patients who have not had extensive chemotherapy, one leukapheresis is often sufficient. In other circumstances, additional leukapheresis are recommended.

## Method of administration

Filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation when used alone:

Filgrastim may be given as a 24 hour subcutaneous continuous infusion or subcutaneous injection. For infusions filgrastim should be diluted in 20 mL of 5% glucose solution (see section 6.6).

Filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation after myelosuppressive chemotherapy:

Filgrastim should be given by subcutaneous injection.

For the mobilisation of PBPCs in normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC transplantation

## Posology

For PBPC mobilisation in normal donors, filgrastim should be administered at 1 MU (10 mcg)/kg/day for 4 to 5 consecutive days. Leukapheresis should be started at day 5 and continued until day 6 if needed in order to collect 4 x 10 6 CD34 +  cells/kg recipient bodyweight.

Method of administration

Filgrastim should be given by subcutaneous injection.

In patients with severe chronic neutropenia (SCN)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Posology

Congenital neutropenia: the recommended starting dose is 1.2 MU (12 mcg)/kg/day, as a single dose or in divided doses.

Idiopathic or cyclic neutropenia: the recommended starting dose is 0.5 MU (5 mcg)/kg/day as a single dose or in divided doses.

Dose adjustment: Filgrastim should be administered daily by subcutaneous injection until the neutrophil count has reached and can be maintained at more than 1.5 x 10 9 /L. When the response has been obtained the minimal effective dose to maintain this level should be established. Long term daily administration is required to maintain an adequate neutrophil count. After one to two weeks of therapy, the initial dose may be doubled or halved depending upon the patient's response. Subsequently, the dose may be individually adjusted every 1 to 2 weeks to maintain the average neutrophil count between 1.5 x 10 9 /L and 10 x 10 9 /L. A faster schedule of dose escalation may be considered in patients presenting with severe infections. In clinical trials, 97% of patients who responded had a complete response at doses ≤ 24 mcg/kg/day. The long-term safety of filgrastim administration above 24 mcg/kg/day in patients with SCN has not been established.

## Method of administration

Congenital, idiopathic or cyclic neutropenia: Filgrastim should be given by subcutaneous injection.

## In patients with HIV infection

## Posology

## For reversal of neutropenia:

The recommended starting dose of filgrastim is 0.1 MU (1 mcg)/kg/day, with titration up to a maximum of 0.4 MU (4 mcg)/kg/day until a normal neutrophil count is reached and can be maintained (ANC &gt; 2 x 10 9 /L). In clinical trials, more than 90% of patients responded at these doses, achieving reversal of neutropenia in a median of 2 days.

In a small number of patients (&lt; 10%), doses up to 1 MU (10 mcg)/kg/day were required to achieve reversal of neutropenia.

For maintaining normal neutrophil counts:

When reversal of neutropenia has been achieved, the minimal effective dose to maintain a normal neutrophil count should be established. Initial dose adjustment to alternate day dosing with 30 MU (300 mcg)/day is recommended. Further dose adjustment may be necessary, as determined by the patient's ANC, to maintain the neutrophil count at &gt; 2 x 10 9 /L. In clinical trials, dosing with 30 MU (300 mcg)/day on 1 to 7 days per week was required to maintain the ANC &gt; 2 x 10 9 /L, with the median dose frequency being 3 days per week. Long term administration may be required to maintain the ANC&gt; 2 x 10 9 /L.

## Method of administration

Reversal of neutropenia or maintaining normal neutrophil counts: filgrastim should be given by subcutaneous injection.

## Elderly

Clinical trials with filgrastim have included a small number of elderly patients but special studies have not been performed in this group and therefore specific dose recommendations cannot be made.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

Studies of filgrastim in patients with severe impairment of renal or hepatic function demonstrate that it exhibits a similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile to that seen in normal individuals. Dose adjustment is not required in these circumstances.

## Paediatric use in the SCN and cancer settings

Sixty-five percent of the patients studied in the SCN trial program were under 18 years of age. The efficacy of treatment was clear for this age group, which included most patients with congenital neutropenia. There were no differences in the safety profiles for paediatric patients treated for SCN.

Data from clinical trials in paediatric patients indicate that the safety and efficacy of filgrastim are similar in both adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.

The dosage recommendations in paediatric patients are the same as those in adults receiving myelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product, should be clearly recorded.

## Special warnings and precautions across indications

## Hypersensitivity

Hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, occurring on initial or subsequent treatment have been reported in patients treated with filgrastim. Permanently discontinue filgrastim in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity. Do not administer filgrastim to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to filgrastim or pegfilgrastim.

## Pulmonary adverse reactions

Pulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial lung disease, have been reported after G-CSF administration. Patients with a recent history of lung infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher risk. The onset of pulmonary signs, such as cough, fever and dyspnoea in association with radiological signs of pulmonary infiltrates and deterioration in pulmonary function may be preliminary signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Filgrastim should be discontinued, and appropriate treatment given.

## Glomerulonephritis

Glomerulonephritis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. Generally, events of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or withdrawal of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. Urinalysis monitoring is recommended.

## Capillary leak syndrome

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Capillary leak syndrome, which can be life-threatening if treatment is delayed, has been reported after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration, and is characterised by hypotension, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and haemoconcentration. Patients who develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care (see section 4.8).

## Splenomegaly and Splenic rupture

Generally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly and cases of splenic rupture have been reported in patients and normal donors following administration of filgrastim. Some cases of splenic rupture were fatal. Therefore, spleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g., clinical examination, ultrasound). A diagnosis of splenic rupture should be considered in donors and/or patients reporting left upper abdominal or shoulder tip pain. Dose reductions of filgrastim have been noted to slow or stop the progression of splenic enlargement in patients with severe chronic neutropenia, and in 3% of patients a splenectomy was required.

## Malignant cell growth

Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro and similar effects may be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro .

## Myelodysplastic syndrome or Chronic myeloid leukaemia

The safety and efficacy of filgrastim administration in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myelogenous leukaemia have not been established. Filgrastim is not indicated for use in these conditions. Particular care should be taken to distinguish the diagnosis of blast transformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia from acute myeloid leukaemia.

## Acute myeloid leukaemia

In view of limited safety and efficacy data in patients with secondary AML, filgrastim should be administered with caution. The safety and efficacy of filgrastim administration in de novo AML patients aged &lt; 55 years with good cytogenetics (t(8;21), t(15;17), and inv(16)) have not been established.

## Thrombocytopenia

Thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim. Platelet counts should be monitored closely, especially during the first few weeks of filgrastim therapy. Consideration should be given to temporary discontinuation or dose reduction of filgrastim in patients with severe chronic neutropenia who develop thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 100 x 10 9 /L).

## Leukocytosis

White blood cell counts of 100 x 10 9 /L or greater have been observed in less than 5% of cancer patients receiving filgrastim at doses above 0.3 MU/kg/day (3 mcg/kg/day). No undesirable effects directly attributable to this degree of leukocytosis have been reported. However, in view of the potential risks associated with severe leukocytosis, a white blood cell count should be performed at regular intervals during filgrastim therapy. If leukocyte counts exceed 50 x 10 9 /L after the expected nadir, filgrastim should be discontinued immediately. When administered for PBPC mobilisation, filgrastim should be discontinued or its dosage should be reduced if the leukocyte counts rise to &gt; 70 x 10 9 /L.

## Immunogenicity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Rates of generation of antibodies against filgrastim is generally low. Binding antibodies do occur as expected with all biologics; however, they have not been associated with neutralising activity at present.

## Aortitis

Aortitis has been reported after G-CSF administration in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. The symptoms experienced included fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers (e.g. c-reactive protein and white blood cell count). In most cases aortitis was diagnosed by CT scan and generally resolved after withdrawal of G-CSF. See also section 4.8.

## Special warning and precautions associated with co-morbidities.

## Special precautions in sickle cell trait and sickle cell disease

Sickle cell crises, in some cases fatal, have been reported with the use of filgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease. Physicians should use caution when prescribing filgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease.

## Osteoporosis

Monitoring of bone density may be indicated in patients with underlying osteoporotic bone diseases who undergo continuous therapy with filgrastim for more than 6 months.

## Special precautions in cancer patients

Filgrastim should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy beyond established dosage regimens.

## Risks associated with increased doses of chemotherapy

Special caution should be used when treating patients with high dose chemotherapy, because improved tumour outcome has not been demonstrated and intensified doses of chemotherapeutic agents may lead to increased toxicities including cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, and dermatologic effects (please refer to the prescribing information of the specific chemotherapy agents used).

## Effect of chemotherapy on erythrocytes and thrombocytes

Treatment with filgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Because of the potential of receiving higher doses of chemotherapy (e.g., full doses on the prescribed schedule) the patient may be at greater risk of thrombocytopenia and anaemia. Regular monitoring of platelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care should be taken when administering single or combination chemotherapeutic agents which are known to cause severe thrombocytopenia.

The use of filgrastim mobilised PBPCs has been shown to reduce the depth and duration of thrombocytopenia following myelosuppressive or myeloablative chemotherapy.

## Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia in breast and lung cancer patients

In the post-marketing observational study setting, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) have been associated with the use of pegfilgrastim, an alternative G-CSF medicine, in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in breast and lung cancer patients. A similar association between filgrastim and MDS/AML has not been observed. Nonetheless, patients with breast cancer and patients with lung cancer should be monitored for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other special precautions

The effects of filgrastim in patients with substantially reduced myeloid progenitors have not been studied. Filgrastim acts primarily on neutrophil precursors to exert its effect in elevating neutrophil counts. Therefore, in patients with reduced precursors neutrophil response may be diminished (such as those treated with extensive radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or those with bone marrow infiltration by tumour).

Vascular disorders, including veno-occlusive disease and fluid volume disturbances, have been reported occasionally in patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy followed by transplantation.

There have been reports of graft vs host disease (GvHD) and fatalities in patients receiving G-CSF after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (see section 4.8 and 5.1).

Increased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient abnormal bone scans. This should be considered when interpreting bone-imaging results.

## Special precautions in patients undergoing PBPC mobilisation

## Mobilisation

There are no prospectively randomised comparisons of the two recommended mobilisation methods (filgrastim alone, or in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy) within the same patient population. The degree of variation between individual patients and between laboratory assays of CD34+ cells mean that direct comparison between different studies is difficult. It is therefore difficult to recommend an optimum method. The choice of mobilisation method should be considered in relation to the overall objectives of treatment for an individual patient.

## Prior exposure to cytotoxic agents

Patients who have undergone very extensive prior myelosuppressive therapy may not show sufficient mobilisation of PBPC to achieve the recommended minimum yield (≥ 2 x 10 6 CD34 +  cells/kg) or acceleration of platelet recovery, to the same degree.

Some cytotoxic agents exhibit particular toxicities to the haematopoietic progenitor pool, and may adversely affect progenitor mobilisation. Agents such as melphalan, carmustine (BCNU), and carboplatin, when administered over prolonged periods prior to attempts at progenitor mobilisation may reduce progenitor yield. However, the administration of melphalan, carboplatin or BCNU together with filgrastim, has been shown to be effective for progenitor mobilisation. When a PBPC transplantation is envisaged, it is advisable to plan the stem cell mobilisation procedure early in the treatment course of the patient. Particular attention should be paid to the number of progenitors mobilised in such patients before the administration of high-dose chemotherapy. If yields are inadequate, as measured by the criteria above, alternative forms of treatment, not requiring progenitor support should be considered.

## Assessment of progenitor cell yields

In assessing the number of progenitor cells harvested in patients treated with filgrastim, particular attention should be paid to the method of quantitation. The results of flow cytometric analysis of CD34 +  cell numbers vary depending on the precise methodology used and recommendations of numbers based on studies in other laboratories need to be interpreted with caution.

Statistical analysis of the relationship between the number of CD34 + cells re-infused and the rate of platelet recovery after high-dose chemotherapy indicates a complex but continuous relationship.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The recommendation of a minimum yields of ≥ 2 x 10 6 CD34 +  cells/kg is based on published experience resulting in adequate haematologic reconstitution. Yields in excess of this appear to correlate with more rapid recovery, those below with slower recovery.

## Special precautions in normal donors undergoing PBPC mobilisation

Mobilisation of PBPC does not provide a direct clinical benefit to normal donors and should only be considered for the purposes of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

PBPC mobilisation should be considered only in donors who meet normal clinical and laboratory eligibility criteria for stem cell donation with special attention to haematological values and infectious disease.

The safety and efficacy of filgrastim have not been assessed in normal donors &lt; 16 years or &gt; 60 years.

Transient thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 100 x 10 9 /L) following filgrastim administration and leukapheresis was observed in 35% of subjects studied. Among these, two cases of platelets &lt; 50 x 10 9 /L were reported and attributed to the leukapheresis procedure.

If more than one leukapheresis is required, particular attention should be paid to donors with platelets &lt; 100 x 10 9 /L prior to leukapheresis; in general apheresis should not be performed if platelets &lt; 75 x 10 9 /L.

Leukapheresis should not be performed in donors who are anticoagulated or who have known defects in haemostasis.

Donors who receive G-CSFs for PBPC mobilisation should be monitored until haematological indices return to normal.

## Special precautions in recipients of allogeneic PBPCs mobilised with filgrastim

Current data indicate that immunological interactions between the allogeneic PBPC graft and the recipient may be associated with an increased risk of acute and chronic GvHD when compared with bone marrow transplantation.

## Special precautions in SCN patients

Filgrastim should not be administered to patients with severe congenital neutropenia who develop leukaemia or have evidence of leukaemic evolution.

## Blood cell counts

Other blood cell changes occur, including anaemia and transient increases in myeloid progenitors, which require close monitoring of cell counts.

## Transformation to leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome

Special care should be taken in the diagnosis of SCNs to distinguish them from other haematopoietic disorders such as aplastic anaemia, myelodysplasia, and myeloid leukaemia. Complete blood cell counts with differential and platelet counts, and an evaluation of bone marrow morphology and karyotype should be performed prior to treatment.

There was a low frequency (approximately 3%) of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or leukaemia in clinical trial patients with SCN treated with filgrastim. This observation has only been made in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients with congenital neutropenia. MDS and leukaemias are natural complications of the disease and are of uncertain relation to filgrastim therapy. A subset of approximately 12% of patients who had normal cytogenetic evaluations at baseline were subsequently found to have abnormalities, including monosomy 7, on routine repeat evaluation. It is currently unclear whether long-term treatment of patients with SCN will predispose patients to cytogenetic abnormalities, MDS or leukaemic transformation. It is recommended to perform morphologic and cytogenetic bone marrow examinations in patients at regular intervals (approximately every 12 months).

## Other special precautions

Causes of transient neutropenia, such as viral infections should be excluded.

Haematuria was common and proteinuria occurred in a small number of patients. Regular urinalysis should be performed to monitor these events.

The safety and efficacy in neonates and patients with autoimmune neutropenia have not been established.

## Special precautions in patients with HIV infection

## Blood cell counts

Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be monitored closely, especially during the first few weeks of filgrastim therapy. Some patients may respond very rapidly and with a considerable increase in neutrophil count to the initial dose of filgrastim. It is recommended that the ANC is measured daily for the first 2-3 days of filgrastim administration. Thereafter, it is recommended that the ANC is measured at least twice per week for the first two weeks and subsequently once per week or once every other week during maintenance therapy. During intermittent dosing with 30 MU (300 mcg)/day of filgrastim, there can be wide fluctuations in the patient's ANC over time. In order to determine a patient's trough or nadir ANC, it is recommended that blood samples are taken for ANC measurement immediately prior to any scheduled dosing with filgrastim.

## Risk associated with increased doses of myelosuppressive medicinal products

Treatment with filgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia due to myelosuppressive medicinal products. As a result of the potential to receive higher doses or a greater number of these medicinal products with filgrastim therapy, the patient may be at higher risk of developing thrombocytopenia and anaemia. Regular monitoring of blood counts is recommended (see above).

## Infections and malignancies causing myelosuppression.

Neutropenia may be due to bone marrow infiltrating opportunistic infections such as Mycobacterium avium complex or malignancies such as lymphoma. In patients with known bone marrow infiltrating infections or malignancy, consider appropriate therapy for treatment of the underlying condition, in addition to administration of filgrastim for treatment of neutropenia. The effects of filgrastim on neutropenia due to bone marrow infiltrating infection or malignancy have not been well established.

## Excipients

## Sorbitol (E420)

Zefylti contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) must not be given this medicinal product unless strictly necessary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Babies and children (below 2 years of age) may not yet be diagnosed with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI). Medicinal products (containing sorbitol/fructose) given intravenously may be life-threatening and should be contraindicated in this population unless there is an overwhelming clinical need and no alternatives are available.

A detailed history with regard to HFI symptoms has to be taken of each patient prior to being given this medicinal product.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per pre-filled syringe, that is to say essentially 'sodium free'.

## Polysorbate 80 (E433)

This medicinal product contains 0.02 mg of polysorbate 80 in each pre-filled syringe. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

The safety and efficacy of filgrastim given on the same day as myelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been definitively established. In view of the sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to myelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy, the use of filgrastim is not recommended in the period from 24 hours before to 24 hours after chemotherapy. Preliminary evidence from a small number of patients treated concomitantly with filgrastim and 5- Fluorouracil indicates that the severity of neutropenia may be exacerbated.

Possible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not yet been investigated in clinical trials.

Since lithium promotes the release of neutrophils, lithium is likely to potentiate the effect of filgrastim. Although this interaction has not been formally investigated, there is no evidence that such an interaction is harmful.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of filgrastim in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. An increased incidence of embryo-loss has been observed in rabbits at high multiples of the clinical exposure and in the presence of maternal toxicity (see section 5.3). There are reports in the literature where the transplacental passage of filgrastim in pregnant women has been demonstrated.

Filgrastim is not recommended during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether filgrastim / metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the new-borns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from filgrastim therapy taking into account the benefit of lactating for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

Filgrastim did not affect reproductive performance or fertility in male or female rats (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Filgrastim may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness may occur following the administration of filgrastim (see section 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most serious adverse reactions that may occur during filgrastim treatment include: anaphylactic reaction, serious pulmonary adverse events (including interstitial pneumonia and ARDS), capillary leak syndrome, severe splenomegaly/splenic rupture, transformation to myelodysplastic syndrome or leukaemia in SCN patients, GvHD in patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow transfer or peripheral blood cell progenitor cell transplant and sickle cell crisis in patients with sickle cell disease.

The most commonly reported adverse reactions are pyrexia, musculoskeletal pain (which includes bone pain, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, pain in extremity, musculoskeletal pain, musculoskeletal chest pain, neck pain), anaemia, vomiting, and nausea. In clinical trials in cancer patients musculoskeletal pain was mild or moderate in 10%, and severe in 3% of patients.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Hypersensitivity

Hypersensitivity-type reactions including anaphylaxis, rash, urticaria, angioedema, dyspnoea and hypotension occurring on initial or subsequent treatment have been reported in clinical trials and in post marketing experience. Overall, reports were more common after intravenous administration. In some cases, symptoms have recurred with rechallenge, suggesting a causal relationship. Filgrastim should be permanently discontinued in patients who experience a serious allergic reaction.

## Pulmonary adverse events

In clinical trials and the post-marketing setting pulmonary adverse events  including interstitial lung disease, pulmonary oedema, and lung infiltration have been reported in some cases with an outcome of respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may be fatal (see section 4.4).

## Splenomegaly and Splenic rupture

Cases of splenomegaly and splenic rupture have been reported following administration of filgrastim. Some cases of splenic rupture were fatal (see section 4.4).

## Capillary leak syndrome

Cases of capillary leak syndrome have been reported with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor use. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced malignant diseases, sepsis, taking multiple chemotherapy medicinal products  or undergoing apheresis (see section 4.4).

## Cutaneous vasculitis

Cutaneous vasculitis has been reported in patients treated with filgrastim. The mechanism of vasculitis in patients receiving filgrastim is unknown. During long term use cutaneous vasculitis has been reported in 2% of SCN patients.

## Leukocytosis

Leukocytosis (WBC &gt; 50 x 10 9 /L) was observed in 41% of normal donors and transient thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 100 x 10 9 /L) following filgrastim and leukapheresis was observed in 35% of donors (see section 4.4).

## Sweets syndrome

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cases of Sweets syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) have been reported in patients treated with filgrastim.

## Pseudogout (chondrocalcinosis pyrophosphate)

Pseudogout (chondrocalcinosis pyrophosphate) has been reported in patients with cancer treated with filgrastim.

## GvHD

There have been reports of GvHD and fatalities in patients receiving G-CSF after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (see section 4.4 and 5.1).

## Paediatric population

Data from clinical trials in paediatric patients indicate that the safety and efficacy of filgrastim are similar in both adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy suggesting no age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim. The only consistently reported adverse event was musculoskeletal pain, which is no different from the exp erience in the adult population. There is insufficient data to further evaluate filgrastim use in paediatric subjects.

## Other special populations

## Geriatric use

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects over 65 years of age compared to younger adult (&gt; 18 years of age) subjects receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy and clinical experience has not identified differences in the responses between elderly and younger adult patients. There is insufficient data to evaluate filgrastim use in geriatric subjects for other approved filgrastim indications.

## Paediatric SCN patients

Cases of decreased bone density and osteoporosis have been reported in paediatric patients with severe chronic neutropenia receiving chronic treatment with filgrastim.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

The effects of filgrastim overdose have not been established. Discontinuation of filgrastim therapy usually results in a 50% decrease in circulating neutrophils within 1 to 2 days, with a return to normal levels in 1 to 7 days.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, colony stimulating factors, ATC Code: L03AA02

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Zefylti is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.

Human G-CSF is a glycoprotein which regulates the production and release of functional neutrophils from the bone marrow. Filgrastim containing r-metHuG-CSF (filgrastim) causes marked increases in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within twenty-four hours, with minor increases in monocytes. In some SCN patients filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and basophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia already prior to treatment. Elevations of neutrophil counts are dose-dependent at recommended doses. Neutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function. Following termination of filgrastim therapy, circulating neutrophil counts decrease by 50% within 1 to 2 days, and to normal levels within 1 to 7 days.

Use of filgrastim in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy leads to significant reductions in the incidence, severity and duration of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Treatment with filgrastim significantly reduces the durations of febrile neutropenia, antibiotic use and hospitalisation after induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia or myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation. The incidence of fever and documented infections were not reduced in either setting. The duration of fever was not reduced in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation.

Use of filgrastim, either alone, or after chemotherapy, mobilises haematopoietic progenitor cells into the peripheral blood. These autologous PBPCs may be harvested and infused after high-dose cytotoxic therapy, either in place of, or in addition to bone marrow transplantation. Infusion of PBPC accelerates haematopoietic recovery reducing the duration of risk for haemorrhagic complications and the need for platelet transfusions.

Recipients of allogeneic PBPCs mobilised with filgrastim experienced significantly more rapid haematological recovery, leading to a significant decrease in time to unsupported platelet recovery when compared with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

One retrospective European study evaluating the use of GCSF after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in patients with acute leukaemias suggested an increase in the risk of GvHD, treatment related mortality (TRM) and mortality when GCSF was administered. In a separate retrospective international study in patients with acute and chronic myelogenous leukaemias, no effect on the risk of GvHD, TRM and mortality was seen. A meta-analysis of allogeneic transplant studies, including the results of nine prospective randomized trials, 8 retrospective studies and 1 case-controlled study, did not detect an effect on the risks of acute GvHD, chronic GvHD or early treatment-related mortality.

Use of filgrastim for the mobilisation of PBPCs in normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC transplantation

In normal donors, a 10 mcg/kg/day dose administered subcutaneously for 4 to 5 consecutive days allows a collection of ≥ 4 x 10 6 CD34 +  cells/kg recipient body weight in the majority of the donors after two leukaphereses.

Use of filgrastim in patients, children or adults, with SCN (severe congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic neutropenia) induces a sustained increase in absolute neutrophil counts in peripheral blood and a reduction of infection and related events.

Use of filgrastim in patients with HIV infection maintains normal neutrophil counts to allow scheduled dosing of antiviral and/or other myelosuppressive treatment. There is no evidence that patients with HIV infection treated with filgrastim show an increase in HIV replication.

As with other haematopoietic growth factors, G-CSF has shown in vitro stimulating properties on human endothelial cells.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Clearance of filgrastim has been shown to follow first-order pharmacokinetics after both subcutaneous and intravenous administration. The serum elimination half-life of filgrastim is approximately 3.5 hours, with a clearance rate of approximately 0.6 mL/min/kg. Continuous infusion with filgrastim over a period of up to 28 days, in patients recovering from autologous bone-marrow transplantation, resulted in no evidence of medicinal product accumulation and comparable elimination half-lives. There is a positive linear correlation between the dose and the serum concentration of filgrastim, whether administered intravenously or subcutaneously. Following subcutaneous administration of recommended doses, serum concentrations were maintained above 10 ng/mL for 8 to 16 hours. The volume of distribution in blood is approximately 150 mL/kg.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Filgrastim was studied in repeated dose toxicity studies up to 1 year in duration which revealed changes attributable to the expected pharmacological actions including increases in leukocytes, myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow, extramedullary granulopoiesis and splenic enlargement. These changes all reversed after discontinuation of treatment.

Effects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. Intravenous (80 mcg/kg/day) administration of filgrastim to rabbits during the period of organogenesis was maternally toxic and increased spontaneous abortion, post-implantation loss, and decreased mean live litter size and foetal weight were observed.

Based on reported data for another filgrastim product similar to reference product, comparable findings plus increased foetal malformations were observed at 100 mcg/kg/day, a maternally toxic dose which corresponded to a systemic exposure of approximately 50-90 times the exposures observed in patients treated with the clinical dose of 5 mcg/kg/day. The no observed adverse effect level for embryo-fetal toxicity in this study was 10 mcg/kg/day, which corresponded to a systemic exposure of approximately 3-5 times the exposures observed in patients treated with the clinical dose.

In pregnant rats, no maternal or foetal toxicity was observed at doses up to 575 mcg/kg/day. Offspring of rats administered filgrastim during the peri-natal and lactation periods, exhibited a delay in external differentiation and growth retardation (≥ 20 mcg/kg/day) and slightly reduced survival rate (100 mcg/kg/day).

Filgrastim had no observed effect on the fertility of male or female rats.

## 1. What Zefylti is and what it is used for

Zefylti is a white blood cell growth factor (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) and belongs to a group of medicines called cytokines. Growth factors are proteins that are produced naturally in the body, but they can also be made using biotechnology for use as a medicine. Zefylti works by encouraging the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells.

A reduction in the number of white blood cells (neutropenia) can occur for several reasons and makes your body less able to fight infection. Zefylti stimulates the bone marrow to produce new white cells quickly.

## Zefylti can be used:

- -to increase the number of white blood cells after treatment with chemotherapy to help prevent infections;
- -to increase the number of white blood cells after a bone marrow transplant to help prevent infections;
- -before high-dose chemotherapy to make the bone marrow produce more stem cells which can be collected and given back to you after your treatment. These can be taken from you or from a donor. The stem cells will then go back into the bone marrow and produce blood cells;
- -to increase the number of white blood cells if you suffer from severe chronic neutropenia to help prevent infections;
- -in patients with advanced HIV infection which will help reduce the risk of infections.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Zefylti

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Do not use Zefylti

- -if you are allergic to filgrastim or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Zefylti.

Please tell your doctor before starting treatment if you have:

- -sickle cell anaemia, as Zefylti may cause sickle cell crisis.
- -osteoporosis (bone disease).

Please tell your doctor immediately during treatment with Zefylti, if you:

- have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing as these could be signs of a severe allergic reaction (hypersensitivity).
- experience puffiness in your face or ankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you notice you urinate less than usual (glomerulonephritis).
- get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or at the tip of your left shoulder (these may be symptoms of an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), or possibly rupture of the spleen).
- notice unusual bleeding or bruising (these may be symptoms of a decrease in blood platelets (thrombocytopenia), with a reduced ability of your blood to clot).

Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) has been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. The symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers. Tell your doctor if you experience these symptoms.

## Loss of response to filgrastim

If you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with filgrastim treatment, your doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which neutralise filgrastim's activity.

Your doctor may want to monitor you closely, see section 4 of the package leaflet.

If you are a patient with severe chronic neutropenia, you may be at risk of developing cancer of the blood (leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)). You should talk to your doctor about your risks of developing cancers of the blood and what testing should be done. If you develop or are likely to develop cancers of the blood, you should not use Zefylti, unless instructed by your doctor.

If you are a stem cell donor, you must be aged between 16 and 60 years.

## Take special care with other products that stimulate white blood cells

Zefylti is one of a group of products that stimulate the production of white blood cells. Your healthcare professional should always record the exact medicine you are using.

## Other medicines and Zefylti

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Zefylti has not been tested in pregnant or breast-feeding women.

Zefylti is not recommended during pregnancy.

It is important to tell your doctor if you:

- -are pregnant or breast-feeding;
- -think you may be pregnant; or
- -are planning to have a baby.

If you become pregnant during Zefylti treatment, please inform your doctor. Unless your doctor directs you otherwise, you must stop breast-feeding if you use Zefylti.

## Driving and using machines

Zefylti may have a minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. This medicine may cause dizziness. It is advisable to wait and see how you feel after taking Zefylti and before driving or operating machinery.

## Zefylti contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per pre-filled syringe, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'.

## Zefylti contains polysorbate 80 (E433)

This medicine contains 0.02 mg of polysorbate 80 in each pre-filled syringe. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## Zefylti contains sorbitol (E420)

This medicine contains 50 mg sorbitol(E420) in each mL.

Sorbitol (E420) is a source of fructose. If you (or your child) have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder, you (or your child) must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break down fructose, which may cause serious side effects.

You must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you (or your child) have HFI or if your child can no longer take sweet foods or drinks because they feel sick, vomit or get unpleasant effects such as bloating, stomach cramps or diarrhoea.

## 3. How to use Zefylti

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure.

## How is Zefylti given and how much should I take?

Zefylti is usually given as a daily injection into the tissue just under the skin (known as a subcutaneous injection). It can also be given as a daily slow injection into the vein (known as an intravenous infusion). The usual dose varies depending on your illness and weight. Your doctor will tell you how much Zefylti you should take.

Patients having a bone marrow transplant after chemotherapy:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

You will normally receive your first dose of Zefylti at least 24 hours after your chemotherapy and at least 24 hours after receiving your bone marrow transplant.

You, or people caring for you, can be taught how to give subcutaneous injections so that you can continue your treatment at home. However, you should not attempt this unless you have been properly trained first by your healthcare provider.

## How long will I have to take Zefylti?

You will need to take Zefylti until your white blood cell count is normal. Regular blood tests will be taken to monitor the number of white blood cells in your body. Your doctor will tell you how long you will need to take Zefylti.

## Use in children

Zefylti is used to treat children who are receiving chemotherapy or who suffer from severe low white blood cell count (neutropenia). The dosing in children receiving chemotherapy is the same as for adults.

## If you use more Zefylti than you should

Do not increase the dose your doctor has given you. If you think you have injected more than you should, contact your doctor as soon as possible.

## If you forget to use Zefylti

If you have missed an injection, or injected too little, contact your doctor as soon as possible. Do not take a double dose to make up for any missed doses. If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

## Please tell your doctor immediately during treatment:

- -if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), skin rash, itchy rash (urticaria), swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat (angioedema) and shortness of breath (dyspnoea).
- -if you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing (dyspnoea) as this can be a sign of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
- -if you experience kidney injury (glomerulonephritis). Kidney injury has been seen in patients who received filgrastim. Call your doctor right away if you experience puffiness in your face or ankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you notice you urinate less than usual.
- -if you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects:
- o swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. These symptoms generally develop in a rapid fashion.
- -

These could be symptoms of a condition called 'Capillary Leak Syndrome' which causes blood to leak from the small blood vessels into your body and needs urgent medical attention. if you have a combination of any of the following symptoms:

- o fever, or shivering, or feeling very cold, high heart rate, confusion or disorientation, shortness of breath, extreme pain or discomfort and clammy or sweaty skin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

These could be symptoms of a condition called 'sepsis' (also called 'blood poisoning'), a severe infection with whole-body inflammatory response which can be life threatening and needs urgent medical attention.

- -if you get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or pain at the tip of your shoulder, as there may be a problem with your spleen (enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) or rupture of the spleen).
- -if you are being treated for severe chronic neutropenia and you have blood in your urine (haematuria). Your doctor may regularly test your urine if you experience this side effect or if protein is found in your urine (proteinuria).

A common side effect of filgrastim use is pain in your muscles or bones (musculoskeletal pain), which can be helped by taking standard pain relief medicines (analgesics). In patients undergoing a stem cell or bone marrow transplant, Graft versus host disease (GvHD) may occur - this is a reaction of the donor cells against the patient receiving the transplant; signs and symptoms include rash on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet and ulcer and sores in your mouth, gut, liver, skin, or your eyes, lungs, vagina and joints.

In normal stem cell donors, an increase in white blood cells (leucocytosis) and a decrease of platelets may be seen. This reduces the ability of your blood to clot (thrombocytopenia). These will be monitored by your doctor.

## Instructions on how to inject yourself.

This section contains information on how to give yourself an injection of Zefylti. It is important that you do not try to give yourself the injection unless you have received special training from your doctor or nurse. Zefylti is provided with a needle safety guard, and you will be shown how to use this by your doctor or nurse. If you are not sure about giving the injection or you have any questions, please ask your doctor or nurse for help.

1. Wash your hands.
2. Remove the syringe from the pack and remove the protective cap from the injection needle. Syringes are embossed with graduation rings in order to enable partial use if required. Each graduation ring corresponds to a volume of 0.025 mL. If partial use of a syringe is required, remove unwanted solution before injection.
3. Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label (EXP). Do not use it if the date has passed the last day of the month shown.
4. Check the appearance of Zefylti. It must be a clear and colourless liquid. If there is discolouration, cloudiness or particles in it, you must not use it.
5. Clean the skin at the injection site using an alcohol wipe.
6. Form a skin fold by pinching the skin between thumb and forefinger.
7. Insert the needle into the skin fold with a quick, firm action.
8. Keeping your skin pinched, depress the plunger slowly and evenly until the entire dose has been given and the plunger cannot be depressed any further. Do not release the pressure on the plunger.
9. After injecting the liquid, remove the syringe from your skin while maintaining pressure on the plunger and then let go of your skin.
10. Let go of the plunger. The needle safety guard will rapidly move to cover the needle.
11. Discard any unused product or waste material. Only use each syringe for one injection.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only

The solution should be visually inspected prior to use. Only clear solutions without particles should be used. Before use, inspect the syringe and use only if it is integral and there are no cracks, or any sign of breakage, needle shield is intact and properly fixed, and needle is not exposed/bent.

Accidental exposure to freezing temperatures does not adversely affect the stability of Zefylti.

Zefylti syringes are for single use only.

Dilution prior to administration (optional)

If required, Zefylti may be diluted in glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution. Zefylti must not be diluted with sodium chloride solutions.

Dilution to a final concentration &lt; 0.2 MU/mL (2 mcg/mL) is not recommended at any time.

For patients treated with filgrastim diluted to concentrations &lt; 1.5 MU/mL (15 mcg/mL), human serum albumin (HSA) should be added to a final concentration of 2 mg/mL.

Example: In a final volume of 20 mL, total doses of filgrastim less than 30 MU (300 mcg) should be given with 0.2 mL of human serum albumin 200 mg/mL (20%) solution Ph. Eur. added.

When diluted in glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution, filgrastim is compatible with glass and polypropylene.

After dilution: Chemical and physical in-use stability of the diluted solution for infusion has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.

Use of Pre-filled syringe with UltraSafe Passive Needle Guard

The pre-filled syringe has an UltraSafe Needle Guard attached in order to protect from needle stick injury. When handling the pre-filled syringe, keep hands behind the needle.

1. Perform the injection using the technique described above.
2. Depress the plunger while grasping the finger flange until the entire dose has been given. The passive needle guard will NOT activate unless the ENTIRE dose has been given.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Disposal

Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
