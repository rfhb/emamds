## 1. Introduction

On 20 th  June 2018, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for delamanid, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are generated as part of the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for delamanid (Deltyba) agreed upon by the European Medicines Agency's decision P/275/2011 on 11 November 2011.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that Study 242-12-232  (Phase 1, Open-label, Multiple-dose, and Age De-escalation Trial to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Delamanid [OPC-67683] in Paediatric Multidrug-resistant  Tuberculosis  Patients  on  Therapy  with  an  Optimized  Background  Regimen  of Antituberculosis Drugs) is part of a clinical development program. The extension application consisting of the full relevant data package (containing several studies) is expected to be submitted by 05/20. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Delamanid was granted conditional marketing authorisation in the EU via a centralised procedure in 2014. This authorisation was renewed in February 2018. It is currently registered and approved in 39 countries but not currently licensed in the US.  Delamanid is indicated for use as part of an appropriate combination  regimen  for  the  treatment  of  pulmonary  multi-drug  resistant  tuberculosis  (MDR-TB)  in adults  only,  when  an  effective  treatment  regimen  cannot  otherwise  be  composed  for  reasons  of resistance or tolerability. It is not currently licensed for use in children since the safety and efficacy of delamanid in children below 18 years of aged have not yet been established.

In  Study  242-12-232,  delamanid  was  administered  to  paediatric  MDR-TB  subjects  on  optimised background regimen (OBR) therapy and was supplied in labelled blister cards as 5 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg tablets. Delamanid 50 mg film-coated tablets is the currently licensed adult formulation and was administered to children from the age of 6 years. For patients younger than 6 years, specific paediatric formulations,  developed  as  part  of  an  agreed  PIP,  were  used.  A  dispersible  25mg  tablet  was administered to children aged 3 to 5 years and a 5 mg dispersible delamanid paediatric formulation (DPF) was given to children under the age of 3 years. The DPF was mixed with water and administered orally as an extemporaneous suspension.

Delamanid  was  administered  with  water  and  food  in  both  a  morning  and  an  evening  dose, approximately 10 hours apart. Food composition was typical for the children's age and needs.

## Assessor's comments:

Study  242-12-232  is  part  of  a  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (PIP),  first  agreed  by  the  Paediatric Committee (PDCO) in November 2011. There were 5 subsequent modifications, the last modification, EMEA-001113-PIP01-10-M05,  was  agreed  in  the  August  2016.  The  latest  EMA  decision  for  this modified PIP, P/0269/2016, was published on 7 th  October 2016. The indication targeted for paediatric development is the ' treatment of multi drug resistant tuberculosis .' There are no waivers agreed in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

PIP for the development for this product.

The PIP contains 5 studies: 1 paediatric formulation development study, a juvenile toxicity assessment and 3 clinical studies. Trial 242-12-232 is study 4 of the agreed PIP. All studies are completed with the exception  of  the  6-month  open  label  extension  trial  which  is  currently  ongoing  and  due  to  be completed by November 2019.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Trial  242-12-232:  Phase  1,  Open-label,  Multiple-dose,  Age  De-escalation  Trial  to  Assess  the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Delamanid (OPC-67683) in Paediatric Multidrugresistant Tuberculosis Patients on Therapy with an Optimised Background regimen (OBR).

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Trial  242-12-232:  Phase  1,  Open-label,  Multiple-dose,  Age  De-escalation Trial to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Delamanid (OPC-67683)  in  Paediatric  Multidrug-resistant  Tuberculosis  Patients  on Therapy with an Optimised Background regimen.

## Description

Trial  242-12-232  was  a  phase  1,  multicentre,  open-label,  uncontrolled,  multiple-dose,  age  deescalation trial to assess the safety and tolerability of delamanid in paediatric subjects with MDR-TB who were also receiving OBR. The goal of this trial was to define the paediatric dose for delamanid in children from birth (0) to 17 years of age that results in delamanid plasma exposure similar to the plasma  exposure  in  adult  patients  that  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  safe  and  effective  for  the treatment of Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB).

## Methods

## Objectives

- To determine the PK of delamanid and its metabolites in combination with OBR in paediatric MDR-TB subjects.
- To determine the safety and tolerability of delamanid in combination with OBR in paediatric MDR-TB subjects.
- To determine the palatability of the delamanid paediatric formulation.

## Study design

This trial was conducted at two (2) Phase 1 sites qualified to treat paediatric subjects with MDR-TB. The protocol was approved by the appropriate national competent authorities (CAs) and the respective

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

IRBs/IECs. Compliance with any other regional or local notification or approval requirements was met and maintained.

The trial was conducted sequentially in 4 groups of paediatric subjects: Group 1 (ages 12 - 17 years, inclusive, n = 7 ), Group 2 (ages 6 - 11 years, inclusive, n = 6), Group 3 (ages 3 - 5 years, inclusive, n = 12), Group 4 (ages birth - 2 years, inclusive, n = 12).

Subjects who dropped out or who completed this trial (Trial 242-12-232) and decided not to participate in the 6-month extension trial (Trial 242-12-233) were replaced.

The study population included male and female subjects between birth and 17 years of age, inclusive, with  a  confirmed  diagnosis  of  MDR  TB  culture  positive  for Mycobacterium  tuberculosis (MTB)  with isoniazid  and  rifampicin  resistance  on  drug  sensitivity  testing  (DST),  or  a  positive  rapid  test demonstrating  resistance  to  rifampicin  alone,  or  to  rifampicin  and  isoniazid,  OR  a  presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary or extrapulmonary MDR-TB, such that the treating physician had decided to treat the subject for MDR-TB. Subjects also had one of the following criteria:

1) Clinical specimen (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], pleural fluid, ascitic fluid, lymph node aspirate, or other tissue) suggestive of tuberculosis disease;

- 2) Persistent cough lasting &gt; 2 weeks;
- 3) Fever, weight loss, and failure to thrive;
- 4) Findings on recent chest radiograph (prior to Visit 1) consistent with TB;

5)  AND  household  contact  with  a  person  with  known  MDR-TB  or  with  a  person  who  died  while appropriately  taking  drugs  for  sensitive  TB;  OR  on  first-line  TB  treatment  but  with  no  clinical improvement.

6) Negative urine pregnancy test for female subjects who had reached menarche.

Trial-specific written informed consent/assent obtained from a subject/guardian or legally acceptable representative, as applicable for local laws prior to the initiation of any protocol-required procedures. In addition, for Groups 1 and 2, the subjects were required provide informed nod at screening and be able to fully understand that he or she were able to withdraw from the trial at any time.

The trial comprised the following periods:

## Pre-treatment Period

- Screening and eligibility assessment from Day -22 to Day -2 (Groups 1, 2, and 3); Day -31 to Day -2 (Group 4).
- Baseline safety assessment on Day -1.

## Treatment Period: Day 1 to Day 18

- Delamanid administration from Day 1 to Day 10
- PK sampling on Days 1, 2, 10, 11, 13 (Groups 1 and 2 only), 15, and 18
- Safety assessments on Days 1, 10 (clinical laboratory tests and urinalysis were conducted only for Groups 1 and 2), and 18
- Discharge on Day 18 after completing all assessments

## Follow-up Period: Day 19 to Day 40 (± 2 days)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All subjects who completed their last scheduled visit were contacted by telephone 28 to 30 days after the  last  dose  of  delamanid  to  assess  any  new  or  ongoing  adverse  events  (AEs).  This  follow-up telephone contact occurred on Day 40 (± 2 days). Subjects who terminated from the trial prior to their last scheduled visit were contacted by telephone or home visit 14 days (± 2 days) after the last dose of delamanid to assess for any new or ongoing AEs.

## Study population /Sample size

A total of 44 subjects were screened for this trial. The trial enrolled 37 males and females ages birth to 17 years, inclusive, who were receiving OBR for confirmed or presumptive MDR-TB. Subjects were to be enrolled in 4 sequential age groups.

- Group 1 (ages 12 - 17 years, inclusive) was expected to enrol a minimum of 6 subjects and must have enrolled at least 2, but not more than 5, females.
- Group 2 (ages 6 - 11 years, inclusive) was expected to enrol a minimum of 6 subjects.
- Group 3 (ages 3 - 5 years, inclusive) and Group 4 (ages birth - 2 years, inclusive) each were expected to enrol a minimum of 12 subjects.

Thirty-seven subjects inclusive of all age and dose groups completed this trial. All enrolled subjects who completed Trial 242-12-232 were rolled over to Trial 242-12-233, an open-label, uncontrolled, 6month extension trial to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and PK of delamanid administered BID for Groups 1, 2, and 3; and once or twice daily, depending upon body weight for Group 4, for 6 months  in  paediatric  subjects  with  MDR-TB.  Trial  242-12-233  was  initiated  as  required  under  the approved Paediatric Investigation Plan.

## Treatments

Delamanid was administered to study subjects for  10  days  with  8  days  of  safety  follow-up  and  PK sampling.

Group 1 (ages 12 - 17 years, inclusive) received adult formulation delamanid 100 mg dosing twice per day (BID) + OBR (n = 7)

Group 2 (ages 6 - 11 years, inclusive) received adult formulation delamanid 50 mg BID + OBR (n = 6)

Group 3 (ages 3 - 5 years, inclusive) received delamanid paediatric formulation (DPF) 25 mg BID + OBR (n = 12)

Group 4 (ages birth - 2 years, inclusive) received the following DPF dose based on body weight during baseline visit (n = 12):

- Subjects &gt; 10 kg received DPF 10 mg BID + OBR
- Subjects &gt; 8 and ≤ 10 kg received DPF 5 mg BID + OBR
- Subjects ≥ 5.5 kg and ≤ 8 kg received DPF 5 mg QD + OBR

The  morning  dose  of  the  delamanid  BID  regimen  was  given  within  30  minutes  after  the  start  of  a standard breakfast meal. The evening dose of the BID dose regimen was given 10 hours post morning dose and within 30 minutes after the start of a standard dinner meal. For the QD regimen, delamanid was administered within 30 minutes after the start of a standard breakfast meal. Food composition was typical for the children's age and needs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The second-line medications generally used in developing OBR for MDR-TB subject treatment are as follows:

- Amikacin
- Capreomycin
- Cycloserine
- Ethambutol
- Ethionamide
- Prothionamide
- Gatifloxacin
- Levofloxacin
- Kanamycin
- Ofloxacin
- P-aminosalicylic acid
- Pyrazinamide
- Streptomycin

Medications with an unclear role in the treatment of MDR-TB and not recommended for routine use for MDR-TB treatment, though sometimes used for highly drug-resistant MDR-TB subjects, are described in  the  WHO  Treatment  Guidelines  for  MDR-TB.  Moxifloxacin  was  excluded  from  the  list  of  allowed medications.

## Outcomes/endpoints

For  each  subject,  the  following  PK  parameters  were  determined  for  delamanid  and  delamanid metabolite (DM-6705):

- Cmax, tmax, AUC0-24h on Day 1 and Day 10
- t ½ z on Day 10
- Rac Day 10/Day 1 for AUC0-24h, and apparent total clearance (CLss/F) for delamanid only

Safety of delamanid was assessed by the following variables:

- Reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)
- Vital signs
- ECGs
- Holter monitoring (if applicable)
- Clinical laboratory assessments (haematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and other laboratory tests)

The  palatability  of  the  paediatric  formulation  was  assessed  using  an  age-appropriate  visual  hedonic scale and clinical assessment.

Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 Deltyba

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The palatability result was based on one of 5 responses: Dislike very much, Dislike a little, Neither liked  nor  disliked,  Like  a  little,  Like  very  much.  The  test  was  assessed  only  for  Groups  3  and  4 receiving  the  delamanid  paediatric  formulation.  The  test  result  was  scored  by  the  investigator  and either a parent or subject score. The frequency counts for subject with each score were summarized at visits that palatability is assessed (Day 1, Day10 and ET).

## Statistical Methods

Determination of Sample Size:

This was a phase 1, open-label trial to assess the PK parameters, safety and tolerability of delamanid. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned. Thus, no formal sample size calculation based on statistical power was required. All statistical presentations are descriptive.

Subject Samples:

- Enrolled Sample: comprised all subjects who signed informed consent to enrol into the current trial and without screen failure.
- Safety Sample: comprised the subjects who had received any amount of trial medication in Trial 242-12-232, regardless of any protocol deviation or violation.
- PK Sample: consisted of the safety sample having a valid PK parameter.

The following delamanid PK parameters were determined using noncompartmental analysis:

- Peak (maximal) concentration of drug in plasma (Cmax), time of peak concentration of drug (tmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24h) on Day 1 and Day 10
- Accumulation ratio Day 10/Day 1 for AUC0-24h
- Apparent terminal phase elimination half-life (t1/2z) and apparent total clearance

Delamanid plasma concentrations across age groups will be analysed using a population pharmacokinetics (POPPK) modelling approach, which will be reported separately.

PK analysis of delamanid metabolite (DM-6705) plasma concentrations was performed where feasible.

- The following PK parameters were determined for DM-6705 using noncompartmental analysis: Cmax, tmax, AUC0-24h on Day 1 and Day 10 and t1/2z.

Plasma concentrations and PK parameters when determined, were reported with descriptive statistics in the PK report. No prior inferential statistical comparisons were performed.

Safety parameters were summarized by incidence rates and their change from baseline if applicable. Change from baseline was summarized for observed cases at each scheduled post-baseline visit and for the last visit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total of 44 subjects were screened for this trial. The trial included 37 males and females ages birth to 17 years, inclusive, who were receiving OBR for confirmed or presumptive MDR-TB were enrolled in 4 sequential age groups. Group 1 (ages 12 - 17 years, inclusive), Group 2 (ages 6 - 11 years, inclusive), Group 3 (ages 3 - 5 years, inclusive) and Group 4 (ages birth - 2 years, inclusive) each were planned to include a minimum of 12 subjects.

Thirty-seven subjects inclusive of all age and dose groups completed this trial.

## Baseline data

Overall, the subjects enrolled were predominantly Asian (25 of 37 [67.6%]). The total number of male and female subjects were approximately equal (18 of 37 subjects were male [48.6%] and 19 of 37 subjects were female [51.4%]). The mean ages of Group 1, 2, 3 and 4 were 15.29, 9.42, 4.28, and 1.64 years, respectively.  The  mean weight of Group 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 39.0, 24.9, 14.2, 9.8 kg, respectively.

## Bioanalytical Results

A total of 582 plasma samples were received by the bioanalytical laboratory. Concentration results for delamanid and DM-6705 were generated for 556 samples; the remaining 26 samples were backups and were not analysed.

## Efficacy results

There are no efficacy results.

## Assessor's comments:

A total of 2 subjects had 2 major protocol deviations that pertained to entry criteria. No subject was discontinued due to a protocol deviation and none of the protocol deviations were determined to have an impact on the study analyses.

This  study  was  designed  to  assess  the  PK  safety  and  tolerability  of  delamanid  in  the  paediatric population.  There  were  no  efficacy  analyses  and  thus  no  conclusions  on  the  treatment  effect  of delamanid use in children can be made.

## Pharmacokinetic results

Median plasma delamanid concentration versus time profiles following oral doses of delamanid on Day 1 and Day 10 to paediatric subjects with MDR-TB (Group 1 - 100 mg BID, Group 2 - 50 mg BID, Group 3  -  25  mg  BID,  Group  4  -  5  to  20  mg)  are  presented  in  Figure  1  and  Figure  2.  Pharmacokinetic assessment of CSF was not conducted.

In  Groups  1  to  4,  the  median  delamanid  Cmax  on  Day  10  was  557,  573,  500,  and  179  ng/mL, respectively;  the  median  AUC0-24h  on  Day  10  was  9790,  12000,  9290,  and  2740  ng*h/mL, respectively. The Cmax and the AUC0-24h ranges were reasonably similar for Groups 1 to 3 but were much lower for Group 4.

The MAH notes that the ratio of AUC0-24h on Day 10 of DM-6705 to delamanid appears to decrease with decreasing age, indicating that either the formation of DM-6705 is decreasing or its elimination is increasing or a combination of the two scenarios. The median terminal elimination half-life of DM-6705 was 237.3 hours in Group 1 and 128.2 hours for Group 4, indicating a more rapid elimination with decreasing age.

In  order  to  compare  the  exposures  across  the  groups,  the  weight  normalized  oral  clearance,  was calculated for each regimen. The median weight-normalized oral clearance on Day 10 for delamanid was 8.92, 6.11, 6.68, and 8.34 for Groups 1 to 4, respectively.

The results indicated that the clearances for all groups, including most subjects in Group 4, were within a narrow range and the lower exposures observed in Group 4 were due to this group receiving lower doses of delamanid.

## Assessor's comments:

No  subjects  had  missing  PK  data.  Delamanid  exposures  in  children  aged  2  years  to  &lt;18  years  in Groups 1 to 3, were comparable to each other but higher than in adults. When considering all age groups, delamanid exposures were the lowest for the youngest children aged from birth to less than 2 years (Group 4).

The dosing regimen for Group 4 was determined by modelling PK data from the previous three groups and it was thus expected that the delamanid doses used would have a higher predicted bioavailability for  children  in  this  age  cohort.  However,  the  current  data  suggest  that  a  higher  delamanid  dose  is needed in the youngest children.

There is a trend for more rapid elimination with decreasing age, but the effect of food on absorption and plasma exposure might be a significant factor for lower delamanid exposure in this age group. Although there were no efficacy nor PK/PD analyses performed in this study, the dose administered in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the youngest cohort could potentially result in sub-optimal exposures, with a reduction in cures rates in young children and might encourage the development of microbiological resistance. A discussion of the effect of food on delamanid exposure in young infants, should be considered for inclusion in the SmPC when the MAH submits their application to extend the indication to children.

These  data  are  proposed  to  update  the  model  used  to  predict  the  dose  in  young  children.  This  is acceptable, however, further data may have to be generated to confirm if the updated dosing regimen has similar exposure and safety profile to older children and adults, to support the extrapolation of efficacy from adults.

The data support further paediatric development but at this stage, do not fully determine the benefit: risk of delamanid in the paediatric population.

## Safety results

- All 37 subjects (100%) enrolled in the trial received all doses of IMP for 10 days. Overall safety results for this open-label, multiple-dose, and age de-escalating trial of 37 subjects showed:
- No subject had a fatal outcome during the trial and no subject discontinued the trial.
- Overall a total of 126 TEAEs were reported by 31 of 37 subjects (83.8%).
- The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  vomiting  (9  of  37  subjects  [24.3%])  followed  by hyperuricaemia (5 of 37 subjects [13.5%]), nausea (5 of 37 subjects [13.5%]), and toothache (5 of 37 subjects [13.5%]).
- All 12 subjects (100.0%) aged 0 to 2 years experienced ≥ 1 TEAE during the trial followed by 9 of 12 subjects (75.0%) aged 3 to 5 years, 5 of 6 subjects (83.3%) aged 6 to 11 years, and 5 of  7  subjects  (71.4%) aged 12 to 17. There was no clinically meaningful difference of TEAE incidences across all age groups.
- Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity except for the TEAE of lower respiratory tract infection, which was considered to be severe in intensity.
- Two subjects (5.4%) each had a SAE; for one subject the SAE was hepatitis A (aged 3to 5 years)  and  for  the  other  subject  the  SAE  was  lower  respiratory  tract  infection  (aged  0  -  2 years). Both SAEs were not related to IMP.
- Of 37, 9 subjects (24.3%) subjects experienced ≥ 1 TEAE that was related to the IMP; the most frequently  reporting  terms  were  diarrhoea  (2  subjects  [5.4%])  and  ECG  QT  prolongation  (2 subjects [5.4%]).
- All IMP-related TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity.
- There were no IMP-related TEAEs experienced by subjects aged 12 to 17 years and 3 subjects each from all other age groups reported IMP-related TEAEs. There were no clinically meaningful differences between the age groups.
- Overall, eosinophilia (2 of 37 subjects (5.4%]; 1 subject aged 3 - 5 and 1 subject aged 0 - 2) and neutropenia (1 of 37 subjects (2.7%]; 1 subject aged 3 - 5) were the TEAEs reported for blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders.  One  incidence  of  eosinophilia  and  neutropenia  were assessed as IMP-related TEAEs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Concurrent  elevation  of  transaminases  ( ≥ 3  ×  ULN)  and  bilirubin  levels  ( ≥ 2  ×  ULN)  was experienced by 1 subject (2.7%) with diagnosed hepatitis A.
- No subject had an abnormal physical examination finding that was considered to be clinically significant.
- Potentially clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs only included changes ≥ 5% in body weight for 8 subjects across all age groups. A decrease ≥ 5% in body weight was only reported for  1  of  37  subjects  (2.7%).  An  increase  of ≥ 5% in  body  weight  was  reported  for  7  of  37 subjects (18.9%) which can be considered as a benefit for the purpose of this trial.
- Overall, 2 of 12 subjects (16.7%) aged 3 to 5 years experienced TEAEs related to ECGs; 1 subject experienced PR prolongation, QT prolongation, and presence of U wave and the other subject experienced QT prolongation. These incidences were reported as IMP-related TEAEs.
- No clinically  relevant  differences  were  noted  for  clinical  laboratory  results,  ECGs,  vital  signs, physical findings, or other observations relating to safety parameters a13.

## Assessor's comments:

Most paediatric patients in this study reported adverse events (AE's). However, none of the AEs led to discontinuation of delamanid or to a fatal outcome during the trial. Only 2 patients had TEAEs classed as serious: 1 subject in Group 3 and 1 subject in Group 4 each had 1 serious TEAE.

Changes to ECGs were recorded in the majority of study patients, with the oldest group of paediatric patients  (group  1)  having  fewer  ECG  abnormalities  compared  to  the  younger  age  cohorts.  (4  of  7 subjects  [57.1%]  in  Group  1,  5  of  6  subjects  [83.3%]  in  Group  2,  10  of  12  subjects  in  Group  3 [83.3%],  and  11  of  12  subjects  [91.6%]  in  Group  4).  The  most  commonly  reported  ECG  rhythm abnormalities were sinus tachycardia and sinus bradycardia. Of the new ECG conduction abnormalities reported in 23 of 37 subjects (62.1%) the most frequently observed were intraventricular conduction defects,  prolonged  QTc  and  1 st degree  AV  block.    Regarding    the  investigational  TEAEs  of  special interest, no new onset changes &gt; 500 msec in QTcB or QTcF were reported. None of the reported ECG changes  led  to  withdrawal  of  study  treatment.  Overall,  the  changes  in  ECG  findings  were  within acceptable limits. The ECG and QT changes described are known to be associated with adult delamanid use and are documented in Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.

No other  TEAEs  of  special  interest  were  identified  during  the  study.  Any  changes  from  baseline  for clinical laboratory test parameters were not clinically significant across the age groups. All of the AE's reported are similar to those in adults and are currently listed in the SmPC. No new safety concern has been identified that warrants an update to the SmPC and PIL or additional risk management measures.

## Palatability results

The majority of the subjects in Groups 3 and 4 found the paediatric formulation to be highly palatable.

In subjects aged 3 to 5 years (Group 3), it was reported at both Visit 3 and Visit 12 that the majority of the subjects liked the taste of delamanid 'very much' based on the investigator or designee score and the parent/patient score. In subjects aged 0 to 2 years (Group 4), it was reported at Visit 3 and Visit 12 that the majority of the subjects liked the taste of delamanid 'very much' or 'a little' based on the investigator or designee score and the parent/patient score. A palatability rating of 'dislike very

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

much' was only reported by 1 (8.3%) subject aged 0 to 2 years at Visit 3 based on the investigator or designee score.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

This was a phase 1, multicentre, open-label, uncontrolled, multiple-dose, and age de-escalation trial of delamanid administered for 10 days with 8 days of safety follow-up and PK sampling. The trial enrolled 37 paediatric MDR-TB subjects from Philippines and South Africa. Four different dosses of delamanid were administered to the subjects in 4 different age groups: Group 1 (ages 12 - 17 years, inclusive), Group 2 (ages 6 - 11 years, inclusive), Group 3 (ages 3 - 5 years, inclusive), and Group 4 (ages 0 - 2 years, inclusive). Subjects in Groups 1 and 2 received the adult formulation and subjects in Groups 3 and 4 received the paediatric formulation cross the age groups.

The objectives of this trial were to determine PK of delamanid and its metabolites in combination with OBR, safety, and tolerability of delamanid in combination with OBR, and palatability of DPF. In Groups 1 to 4, the median delamanid Cmax on Day 10 was 557, 573, 500, and 179 ng/mL, respectively; the median AUC0-24h on Day 10 was 9790, 12000, 9290 ng*h/mL, and 2740, respectively. The Cmax and the AUC0-24h ranges were reasonably similar for Groups 1 to 3 but were much lower for Group 4. The median weight-normalized oral clearance on Day 10 for delamanid was 8.92, 6.11, 6.68, and 8.34 for Groups 1 to 4, respectively.

Since  the  dosing  regimens  were  different  for  each  group  as  well  as  subject  to  body  weights,  to compare the exposures across the groups, the weight normalized oral clearance, was calculated for each  regimen.  A  visual  check  of  the  numbers  indicated  that  when  normalized,  the  median  oral clearance normalized to subject body weight (CL/F/BW) ranged between 6.11 to 8.92 for all Groups, except for the two subjects (# 43 and # 45) in Group 4 (5 mg QD), whose CL/F/BW was about twice the  value  of  the  other  groups,  (i.e.,  17.8).  This  could  be  due  to  either  impaired  absorption  (F)  or increased intrinsic clearance. It is unlikely to be due to increased intrinsic clearance as this would have been indicated by a systematic increase in oral clearance across the groups, which was not observed. The  impaired  absorption  could  be  due  to  either  the  dosage  strength  or  the  amount/type  of  food ingested along with the dose. The dosage strength of 5 mg in Group 4 appears unlikely as a factor in explaining the lower exposure, as the subjects receiving 10 mg BID (5 mg × 2 BID) and 5 mg BID had CL/F/BW values within the range seen in other groups. Since the absorption of delamanid is affected by food it is very possible that subjects in Group 4, being the youngest in the trial, consumed both a lower total amount of food as well as relatively, a lower amount of fat with delamanid administration. Overall, this indicates that the delamanid oral clearance in the paediatric subjects was within a narrow range and the lower exposures observed in Group 4 can be overcome by administering higher doses of delamanid.

For comparison to the adult data, following 100 mg BID delamanid administration in adults with MDRTB, on Day 14, the median Cmax was 371 ng/ml and the AUC0-24h was 6811 ng*h/ml22 which are lower than that observed in Groups 1 to 3 paediatric subjects. The median clearance on Day 14 was 0.602  L/h/kg  which  is  equal  to  10.03  mL/min/kg,  a  value  somewhat  higher  that  the  clearance observed in the paediatric subjects. It appears that the ratio of AUC0-24h on Day 10 of DM-6705 to delamanid  decreased  with  decreasing  age,  indicating  that  either  the  formation  of  DM-6705  is decreasing or its elimination is increasing or a combination of the two scenarios. The median terminal elimination half-life of DM-6705 is 237.3 hours in Group 1 and 128.2 hours for Group 4, indicating a more rapid elimination with decreasing age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety results exhibited during this trial are consistent across all age groups. The TEAEs observed in this 10-day trial were consistent with the current safety  profile of delamanid. There were no trends in  the  incidences  of  TEAEs  across  the  age  groups.  Overall,  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs occurred in the MedDRA SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders (17 of 37 subjects [45.9%]) and Infections and Infestations (15 of 37 subjects [40.5%]). Overall, the most frequently reported TEAE was vomiting (9 of 37 subjects [24.3%]) followed by hyperuricaemia (5 of 37 subjects [13.5%]), nausea (5 of 37 subjects [13.5%]), and toothache (5 of 37 subjects [13.5%]). Poor dental hygienic conditions were observed during this 10-day trial in subjects aged 12 to 17 years, 6 to 11 years, and 3 to 5 years. The assessment of ECGs, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests did not show any consistent differences across the age groups. Overall, elevated uric acid (8.3%), elevated AST (3.1%), elevated ALT (2.9%), elevated total  bilirubin  (2.9%),  elevated  cholesterol  (2.7%),  and  elevated  prothrombin  time  (2.9%) were the only reported clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities. One subject (2.7%) aged 3 to 5 years reported elevated levels of transaminases and total bilirubin and with diagnosed hepatitis A.

New onset changes &gt; 450 msec (40.5%) in QTcB, new onset changes &gt; 450 msec (8.1%) in QTcF, new abnormal rhythm (81.0%), and new conduction abnormalities (62.1%) were the most frequently reported  clinically  significant  abnormalities  or  changes  in  ECG  results.  There  were  no  new  onset changes &gt; 500 msec in QTcB or QTcF. Decrease of ≥ 5% of body weight (2.7%) and increase of ≥ 5% of body weight (18.9%) were the potentially clinically significant abnormalities reported for vital signs. There were no clinically relevant differences in the mean changes from baseline for the various vital sign  parameters  across  the  age  groups.  The  majority  of  the  subjects  aged  0  to  5  years  liked  the palatability of the DPF.

## Summary

Delamanid exposures were higher in the MDR-TB paediatric population, except Group 4, compared to adult  data.  Exposures  of  delamanid  metabolite  DM-6705  were  lower  in  the  paediatric  population, compared to adults with MDR-TB. The terminal half-life of DM-6705 decreased with decreasing age. Delamanid demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in the paediatric population studied during this 10-day  trial  and  no  new  safety  concerns  were  identified.  Delamanid  paediatric  formulation  was palatable in children aged from birth to  5 years.

The Trial 242-11-232 involved children aged 0-17 years , a patient population for which the treatment with  Deltyba  is  not  yet  approved  in  the  EU.  The  MAH  states  that  the  results  of  the  trial  are  of significant  importance  for  the  future  application  of  the  approval  of  delamanid  paediatric  MDR-TB indication,  however,  do  not  require  an  immediate  change  of  the  current  SmPC  for  Deltyba.  This  is acceptable.

Further MS comments were received regarding PK data, which are endorsed by the Rapporteur:

No conclusions can be drawn on the basis of the current PK analyses. The sampling times were too sparse to have reliable results with noncompartmental analysis. With that none of the PK parameters the Company is showing (Cmax, tmax, AUC0-24h on Day 1 and Day 10 and t1/2z) is reliable. This is also  very  clear  from  the  values  of  Tmax  shown  in  tables  1  (Delamanid  Day  1)  and  2  (Delamanid Day10) on page 13 of the assessment report: with Tmax values of 23-96 hours  in group 3 (table 1) or 13-75 hours in  group  4  (table  2)  with  BID  dosing.  These  Tmax  values  do  not  correspond  with  the currently proposed dose regimen.

Given the sampling schedule, popPK analysis makes more sense. PopPK analysis is planned, but this will be reported separately, after completion of the follow-up study 233.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

This  study  provides  preliminary  PK,  safety  and  tolerability  data  for  delamanid  administration  in children. However, no conclusions can be made based on the current PK analyses. These data can be used  to support further paediatric development  of  this product. At this stage of paediatric development, they do not fully determine the benefit: risk of delamanid in the paediatric population. Therefore, no update to the product information is required.
