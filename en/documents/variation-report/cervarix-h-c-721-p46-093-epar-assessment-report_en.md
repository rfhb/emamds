## 2. Assessment of the post-authorisation measure PAM MenACWY-TT-054

Based on the epidemiology of disease caused by N. meningitidis and Bordetella pertussis, adolescents stand to benefit from vaccination against both pathogens. Co-administration of MenACWY-TT with Boostrix (Tdap) was evaluated in male and female subjects aged between 11 and 25 years (adolescents and adults) in a separate clinical study. The current study evaluated co-administration of MenACWY-TT, Cervarix and Boostrix as compared to administration of MenACWY-TT and Cervarix vaccines alone in females from 9 to 25 years of age. Co-administration of the three vaccines may contribute to improve the implementation and coverage of adolescent vaccination programmes.

## STUDY OBJECTIVES

The co-primary objectives were assessed in hierarchical manner according to the order presented below. A co-primary objective could only be met if the statistical criteria for that objective as well as the statistical criteria for all previous co-primary objectives were met.

## Co-primary objectives

To demonstrate the non-inferiority of MenACWY-TT co-administered with Cervarix compared to MenACWY-TT alone with respect to serum bactericidal assay (using baby rabbit complement, rSBA) geometric mean titres (GMTs) for serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y one month after MenACWY-TT vaccination.

Non-inferiority criterion: For each serogroup separately, one month after vaccination with MenACWYTT, the upper limit (UL) of the two-sided standardised asymptotic 95% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of rSBA GMTs (ACWY-TT group/ACWYHPV group) was &lt; the pre-defined limit of 2.

To demonstrate the non-inferiority of Cervarix co-administered with MenACWY-TT compared to Cervarix alone in terms of human papilloma virus 16 (HPV16) and HPV18 GMTs as measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) one month after the third dose of Cervarix.

Non-inferiority criterion: For each HPV antigen separately (HPV16 and HPV18), one month after the third dose of Cervarix, the UL of the two-sided standardised asymptotic 95% CI on the group GMT ratio (HPV group/ACWYHPV group) was &lt; the pre-defined limit of 2.

To demonstrate the non-inferiority of MenACWY-TT co-administered with Cervarix and Boostrix compared to MenACWY-TT alone with respect to rSBA GMTs for serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y one month after MenACWY-TT vaccination.

Non-inferiority criterion: For each serogroup separately, one month after vaccination with MenACWYTT, the UL of the two sided standardised asymptotic 95% CI for the ratio of rSBA GMTs (ACWY-TT group/Co-ad group) was &lt; the pre-defined limit of 2.

To demonstrate the non-inferiority of Cervarix co-administered with MenACWY-TT and Boostrix compared to Cervarix co-administered with Boostrix in terms of HPV16 and HPV18 GMTs as measured by ELISA one month after the third dose of Cervarix.

Non-inferiority criterion: For each HPV antigen separately (HPV16 and HPV18), one month after the third dose, the UL of the two-sided standardised asymptotic 95% CI on the group GMT ratio (Tdap group/Co-ad group) was &lt; the pre-defined limit of 2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To demonstrate the non-inferiority of Boostrix co-administered with MenACWY-TT and Cervarix compared to Boostrix co-administered with Cervarix in terms of antibody concentrations against diphtheria toxoid (anti-D) and tetanus toxoid (anti-T) one month after Boostrix vaccination.

Non-inferiority criterion: The lower limit (LL) of the two-sided standardised asymptotic 95% CI for the group difference (Co-ad group minus Tdap group) in the percentage of subjects with anti-D antibody concentrations ≥ 1.0 IU/mL was ≥ the pre-defined limit of -10%. and the LL of the two-sided standardised asymptotic 95% CI for the group difference (Co-ad group minus Tdap group) in the percentage of subjects with anti-T antibody concentrations ≥ 1.0 IU/mL was ≥ the pre-defined limit of 10%.

To demonstrate the non-inferiority of Boostrix co-administered with MenACWY-TT and Cervarix compared to Boostrix co-administered with Cervarix with respect to Geometric mean concentration (GMC) to each discrete pertussis antigen (pertussis toxoid [PT], filamentous hemagglutinin [FHA] and pertactin [PRN]) one month after Boostrix vaccination.

Non-inferiority criterion: For each discrete pertussis antigen (PT, FHA and PRN), the UL of the twosided 95% CI for the group ratio of GMC (Tdap group / Co-ad group) was ≤ the predefined limit of 1.5.

## Secondary objectives

## Immunogenicity

Prior to and one month after vaccination with MenACWY-TT

- To evaluate the immunogenicity of subjects in the ACWYHPV, ACWY-TT and Coad groups in terms of percentage of subjects with rSBA titres ≥ 1:8, ≥ 1:128 and vaccine response one month post-vaccination.
- To evaluate the immunogenicity of the TT carrier protein in the ACWY-TT group in terms of the percentage of subjects with anti-T concentrations ≥ 0.1 IU/mL, ≥ 1.0 IU/mL and GMCs. Prior to the first dose of Cervarix and one month after the third dose of Cervarix
- To evaluate the immunogenicity of Cervarix in subjects in the ACWYHPV, HPV, Co-ad, ACWY-TT and Tdap groups with respect to the percentage of subjects with titres ≥ 19 EL.U/mL for antiHPV16 and ≥ 18 EL.U/mL for anti-HPV18.
- To evaluate the immunogenicity of subjects in the ACWY-TT group with respect to HPV16 and HPV18 GMTs.
- To evaluate the immunogenicity of the ACWYHPV, ACWY-TT, HPV, Co-ad and Tdap groups with respect to seroconverstion rates of anti-HPV16 and anti-HPV18 titres one month post dose 3. Prior to and one month after vaccination with Boostrix
- To evaluate the booster responses to PT, FHA and PRN in the Co-ad and Tdap groups.
- To evaluate the immunogenicity of Boostrix in the Co-ad and Tdap groups in terms of percentage of subjects with anti-D and anti-T concentrations ≥ 0.1 IU/mL, anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN concentrations ≥ the assay cut-offs and GMCs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Exploratory objectives

The exploratory objectives were related to the comparability of the study vaccine versus the control vaccines in terms of immune response to the different vaccine antigens one month after the vaccination with MenACWY-TT and one month after the third dose Cervarix vaccination.

These group comparisons are exploratory and any potential differences should be interpreted with caution considering that there was no adjustment for multiplicity of comparisons and that the clinical relevance of any differences remains unknown.

## Safety and reactogenicity

To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity after vaccination with MenACWY-TT, Boostrix and Cervarix in all groups:

- Solicited local and general Adverse events (AEs): - Days 0-6 following vaccination with MenACWY-TT administered alone or coadministered with Cervarix or Cervarix + Boostrix. Days 0-6 after Dose 1 of Cervarix administered alone or co-administered with MenACWY-TT or MenACWY-TT + Boostrix, - Days 0-6 following vaccination with Boostrix co-administered with Cervarix or with Cervarix + MenACWY-TT.
- Unsolicited symptoms on Days 0-30 after vaccination with MenACWY-TT, the first dose of Cervarix and/or Boostrix in all groups.
- Serious adverse events (SAEs) and new onset of chronic illness(es) (NOCIs, e.g. autoimmune disorders, asthma, type 1 diabetes and allergies) and Potential immunemediated diseases (pIMDs) from first vaccination through study end in all groups.

The study design overview is presented in Figure 1.

## Immunological correlates of protection

## Bactericidal Assay using rabbit complement rSBA:

Bactericidal antibodies are recognised as surrogate markers of protection. An rSBA cutoff of 8 (reciprocal dilution) has shown to be the most consistent with observed efficacy at four weeks post-vaccination with a meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine in post-licensure efficacy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

estimates in the United Kingdom [Andrews, 2003]. The threshold for protection for other serogroups is still to be defined, although it is common practice to extend the cut-off of 8 to rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY [CDC, 2006].

Vaccine response for rSBA was defined as post-vaccination titre ≥ 1:32 one month after vaccination in subjects initially seronegative (rSBA titre &lt;1:8) and at least four times the prevaccination antibody titres in subjects initially seropositive (rSBA titre ≥ 1:8).

## Anti-HPV

There are currently no correlates of protection defined for the HPV16 and HPV18 antigens used as part of the Cervarix vaccine. The percentage of subjects with anti- HPV16 titres ≥19 EL.U/mL and anti-HPV18 titres ≥18 EL.U/mL is reported, along with GMTs.

## Anti-D and anti-T

Neutralising antibody levels ≥ 0.1 IU/mL are considered to provide protection to diphtheria and tetanus [Plotkin, 2001].

## Anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN

There are no correlates of protection for anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN antibody. The percentage of subjects seropositive for each antigen (% with antibody concentration equal or above the assay cut-offs), GMCs and pertussis booster responses is reported.

Booster response to PT, FHA and PRN was defined as:

- For subjects with pre-vaccination antibody concentration below the assay cutoffs, postvaccination antibody concentration ≥ four times the assay cut-offs,
- For subjects with pre-vaccination antibody concentration between the assay cutoffs and below four times the assay cut-offs, post-vaccination antibody concentration ≥ four times the pre-vaccination antibody concentration,
- For subjects with pre-vaccination antibody concentration ≥ four times the assay cut-offs, post-vaccination antibody concentration ≥ two times the pre-vaccination antibody concentration.

Seroconversion was defined as the appearance of antibodies (i.e. titre/concentration ≥ the cut-off value) in the serum of subjects who were seronegative before vaccination.

## Secondary objectives:

Immunogenicity with respect to components of MenACWY-TT vaccine at one month after vaccination

- Vaccine response against all meningococcal serogroups was observed in a range from 90.2% for rSBA-MenA in the Co-ad group to 100% for rSBA-MenA and rSBA-MenW-135 in the ACWYHPV group across the ACWY-TT, ACWYHPV and Co-ad groups.
- The percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 or rSBA-MenY titres ≥ 1:8 was at least 97.3% for all serogroups across the ACWY-TT, ACWYHPV and Co-ad groups.
- Across the study groups rSBA GMT value ranged from 4649.6 to 5517.1 for rSBAMenA and from 3598.6 to 5091.0 for rSBA-MenC. Consistently in all groups higher GMTs were observed for rSBA-MenW-135 (range from 11663.6 to 18068.3) and rSBA-MenY (range from 11201.2 to 12758.9).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- All subjects in the ACWY-TT group had seroprotective levels of anti-T antbodies ( ≥ 0.1 IU/mL) with a GMT of 25.4.

Immunogenicity with respect to components of the co-administered Boostrix vaccine at one month after Boostrix vaccination

- -Diphtheria and tetanus antigens
- Seroprotective anti-D antibody concentration ( ≥ 0.1 IU/mL) was observed in all subjects in Coad and Tdap groups. GMC values ranged between 4.7 (Co-ad group) and 6.6 (Tdap group) in both groups.
- Seroprotective anti-T antibody concentration ( ≥ 0.1 IU/mL) was observed in all subjects across the Co-ad and Tdap groups. The GMC values ranged between 15.4 (Tdap group) and 25.9 (Coad group) in both study groups.
- -Pertussis antigens
- Booster response to PT ranged from 89.0% (Co-ad group) to 92.5% (Tdap group), booster response to FHA ranged from 96.5% (Tdap group) to 97.2% (Co-ad group) and booster response to PRN ranged from 93.9% (Co-ad group) to 96.9% (Tdap group).
- The percentage of subjects with anti-PT, anti-FHA, or anti-PRN concentration ≥ the assay cutoffs was at least 98.0% for all pertussis antigens in the Co-ad and Tdap groups.
- Anti-PT GMC values ranged from 52.9 (Co-ad group) to 73.2 (Tdap group), anti- FHA GMC values ranged from 278.7 (Co-ad group) to 472.4 (Tdap group) and anti- PRN GMC values ranged from 193.4 (Co-ad group) to 318.6 (Tdap group).

Immunogenicity with respect to components of the co-administered Cervarix vaccine at one month after the third dose of Cervarix vaccination.

- The percentage of subjects with anti-HPV-16 concentration ≥ 19 EU/mL and anti- HPV-18 concentration ≥ 18 EU/mL was at least 99.6% across all study groups.
- Anti-HPV-16 GMT values ranged from 9563.8 (Co-ad) to 12124.9 (ACWYHPV) and anti-HPV-18 GMT values ranged from 4306.2 (Co-ad) to 5655.0 (HPV) across all study groups.

## Exploratory objectives

The exploratory objectives were related to the comparability of the study vaccine versus the control vaccines in terms of immune response to the different vaccine antigens one month after the vaccination with MenACWY-TT and one month after the third dose Cervarix vaccination.

These group comparisons are exploratory and any potential differences should be interpreted with caution considering that there was no adjustment for multiplicity of comparisons and that the clinical relevance of any differences remains unknown.

To summarize according to the MAH, non-inferiority of the immunogenicity (primary analysis) of Boostrix co-administered with MenACWYTT and Cervarix (Co-ad group) was not demonstrated as compared to Boostrix co-administered with Cervarix (Tdap group) with respect to GMC to each discrete pertussis antigen (PT, FHA and PRN) one month after Boostrix vaccination.

Despite failure to meet the non-inferiority criterion, vaccine response rate and GMC fold increase (secondary analysis) between pre- and post-vaccination showed robust booster responses to vaccination for each pertussis antigen in both groups (Co-ad group and Tdap group), suggesting that the statistically significant differences are not deemed to be clinically relevant.

## CHMP comment

All the co-primary objectives were met except one.

Non-inferiority of Cervarix co-administered with MenACWY-TT compared to Cervarix administered alone in terms of HPV16 and HPV18 GMTs as measured by ELISA one month after the third dose of Cervarix was demonstrated as the UL of the two-sided standardised asymptotic 95% CI on the group GMT ratio (HPV group/ACWYHPV group) was 1.19 and 1.31 for HPV16 and HPV18 respectively, which is &lt; the pre-defined limit of 2 for each HPV antigen.

In the primary analysis, non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of Boostrix co-administered with MenACWYTT and Cervarix (Co-ad group) was not demonstrated as compared to Boostrix coadministered with Cervarix (Tdap group) with respect to GMC to each discrete pertussis antigen (PT, FHA and PRN) one month after Boostrix vaccination. The co-administration of Tdap Boostrix with Nimenrix and Cervarix one month later tended to elicit lower anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN GMCs as compared to Boostrix co-administered with Cervarix alone. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known.

Meanwhile in the secondary analysis, the response rates and GMC fold increase between pre- and postvaccination showed robust responses to vaccination for each pertussis antigen in both groups (Co-ad group and Tdap group), suggesting - according to the MAH - that the statistically significant differences are not deemed to be clinically relevant.

The SmPC should address these results and uncertainty.

The section 4.5 should provide information on the potential for clinically relevant interactions based on the pharmacodynamic properties and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies of the vaccines studied. Specifically, the existence or not of clinically relevant interference in the antibody response when coadministration occurs should be adequately addressed.

The current SmPC of Cervarix does not include any information on the co-administration of Cervarix with meningococcal vaccine. Meanwhile, information on the co-administration of Cervarix with a combined booster vaccine containing diphtheria (d), tetanus (T) and pertussis [acellular] (pa) with or without inactivated poliomyelitis (IPV) - with no clinically relevant interference with antibody response to any of the components of either vaccine - is included in section 4.5 of SmPC of Cervarix. Also, other co-administrations with Cervarix are addressed (combined hepatitis A (inactivated) and hepatitis B (rDNA) vaccine or with hepatitis B (rDNA) vaccine).

Meanwhile, the MAH does not consider an update of the SmPC with co-administration of Cervarix with meningococcal vaccine as relevant because of the limited number of European countries having a recommendation for quadrivalent meningococcal vaccination in adolescents.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This rationale cannot be endorsed by the Rapporteur.

This study provides new data regarding co-administration of Cervarix, i e with Nimenrix and with Nimenrix+Boostrix, which warrants an update of its SmPC. Therefore, the MAH is requested to address the results of this study MenACWY-TT-054 especially since non-inferiority of Boostrix co-administered with MenACWY-TT and Cervarix compared to Boostrix co-administered with Cervarix with respect to Geometric mean concentration (GMC) to each discrete pertussis antigen (pertussis toxoid [PT], filamentous hemagglutinin [FHA] and pertactin [PRN]) one month after Boostrix vaccination was not demonstrated although the clinical relevance is unknown. Issue remains.

## SAFETY RESULTS

The primary analysis was performed on the TVC. As the percentage of vaccinated subjects eliminated from the ATP cohort for analysis of safety was &lt; 5%, an analysis on the ATP cohort for safety was not performed to supplement the TVC analysis.

## Solicited adverse events:

During the 7-day (Days 0-6) follow-up period, pain was the most frequently reported solicited local AE at the MenACWY-TT injection site, reported by 58.7%, 54.5% and 60.0% of subjects in the ACWY-TT group, ACWYHPV and Co-ad groups, respectively. Grade 3 local AEs were reported by no more than 2.7% of subjects in all three groups.

During the 7-day (Days 0-6) follow-up period, pain was the most frequently reported solicited local AE at Boostrix injection site, reported by 72.7% and 76.6% of subjects in the Co-ad and Tdap groups, respectively. Grade 3 local AEs were reported by no more than 8.1% of subjects in both groups.

During the 7-day (Days 0-6) follow-up period, pain was the most frequently reported solicited local AE at the injection site after the first dose of Cervarix, reported by 74.8%, 82.9%, 79.2%, 83.5% and 84.7% of subjects in the ACWY-TT, ACWYHPV, HPV, Co-ad and in groups. Grade 3 local AEs were reported by no more than 8.8% of subjects in all study groups.

During the 7-day (Days 0-6) follow-up period, fatigue, headache and myalgia were the most frequently reported general AE across all study groups. - Fatigue was reported by 40.5%, 36.7%, 32.6%, 42.3% and 38.7% of subjects in the ACWY-TT, ACWYHPV, HPV, Co-ad and Tdap groups, respectively. Headache was reported by 39.0%, 36.3%, 29.9%, 38.1% and 36.4% of subjects in the ACWYTT, ACWYHPV, HPV, Co-ad and Tdap groups, respectively. - Myalgia was reported by 36.7%, 32.0%, 32.6%, 36.9% and 38.7% of subjects in the ACWY-TT, ACWYHPV, HPV, Co-ad and Tdap groups, respectively.

## Unsolicited AEs

Unsolicited symptoms were reported by a maximum of 16.2% of subjects across the study groups and unsolicited symptoms assessed by the investigator as causally related to vaccination were reported by no more than 5.0% of subjects across the study groups. Grade 3 unsolicited symptoms were reported by a maximum of 1.9% subjects across the study groups and grade 3 unsolicited symptoms assessed by the investigator as causally related to vaccination was reported by no more than one subject in the Tdap group only.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During the 31-day post-Dose 1 vaccination period: - At least one unsolicited symptom was reported by 14.3%, 13.5%, 13.4%, 16.2% and 14.9% of subjects in ACWY-TT, ACWYHPV, HPV, Co-ad and Tdap groups, respectively. - Grade 3 unsolicited symptoms were reported by 1.2%, 1.2%, 1.9%, 1.5% and 1.9% of subjects in ACWY-TT, ACWYHPV, HPV, Co-ad and Tdap groups, respectively. - Unsolicited symptoms assessed as causally related to vaccination by the investigator were reported by 2.3%, 3.1%, 1.1%, 5.0% and 1.5% of subjects in ACWY-TT, ACWYHPV, HPV, Co-ad and Tdap groups, respectively. - Grade 3 unsolicited symptoms assessed as causally related to vaccination by the investigator were reported by 0.4% of subjects in the Tdap group only.

During the 31-day post-Dose 2 vaccination period for ACWY-TT group: - At least one unsolicited symptom was reported by 8.5% of subject after the first dose of Cervarix. - Grade 3 unsolicited symptoms were reported by 1.2% of subject after the first dose Cervarix. - Unsolicited symptoms assessed as causally related to vaccination by the investigator were reported by 0.4% of subject after the first dose Cervarix.

## Serious adverse events:

SAEs were reported by a maximum of 22 subjects across study groups of which all recovered and the SAEs had resolved by study end. Among the child cases, three SAEs were reported for one infant in the Tdap group with fatal outcome. None of the SAEs (fatal and non-fatal SAEs) were considered by the investigator as causally related to vaccination.

- -During the entire study period in the overall vaccinated population, at least one SAE was reported by three subjects (1.2%) in the ACWY-TT group, two subjects (0.8%) in the ACWYHPV group, five subjects (1.9%) in the HPV group, seven subjects (2.7%) in the Co-ad group and six subjects (2.3% [includes one child case]) in the Tdap group.
- -During the entire study period in the child population, three SAEs were reported for one infant (0.4%) in the Tdap group.
- -None of these SAEs were considered by the investigator as causally related to vaccination

## Fatal events:

Three SAEs (prematurity, low weight at birth and respiratory distress syndorme) were reported for the offspring of a 25-year female subject. The subject had received one dose of Boostrix and two doses of Cervarix before conception. Nine months after the second dose of Cervarix vaccination and 10 months after Boostrix vaccination the baby was born prematurely by normal vaginal delivery at 34 weeks of gestation. He died after 13 days and his death and none of the SAEs were considered by the investigator as causally related to Boostrix and/or Cervarix vaccination.

## Non-fatal events:

Twenty-two non-fatal SAEs were reported across the five groups during the entire study period. These SAEs were all recovered/resolved by the study end and none of them were considered by the investigator as causally related to the vaccination.

## Adverse events leading to premature discontinuation of study vaccine and/or study:

No AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study vaccine and/or study were reported during the study period.

## Other significant adverse events:

From first dose up to study end, at least one NOCI was reported by no more than 1.2% of subjects and no pIMDs were reported by any subjects across all study groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy

During the entire study period, 21 pregnancies were reported across the five groups (two in the ACWYTT group, five in the ACWYHPV group, four in the HPV group, six in the Co-ad group and four in the Tdap group). All 21 subjects had been exposed to study vaccines before conception (at Visit1) and were discontinued from further treatment, except for one subject who received the second dose of Cervarix in the first trimester of pregnancy at Visit 2 as the pregnancy test was negative. The pregnancy outcomes are as follows:

- -One subject had an elective termination with no apparent congenital anomaly
- -13 subjects had a live infant with no apparent congenital anomaly
- -Two subjects had spontaneous abortion with no apparent congenital anomaly (according to study protocol a pregnancy outcome with spontaneous abortion is considered an SAE).
- -Three subjects were still pregnant at the end of the study
- -Two subjects were lost to follow-up .

## Safety summary

No safety concerns were identified. Nimenrix, Boostrix and Cervarix vaccines were well tolerated when coadministered to 9-25 years old females, and their safety profiles were not affected by coadministration of the three vaccines.

## CHMP comment

No concerns were identified. Nimenrix, Boostrix and Cervarix vaccines were well tolerated when coadministered to 9-25 years old females. Their safety profiles were not affected by co-administration of the three vaccines.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion

Based on the epidemiology of disease caused by N. meningitidis and Bordetella pertussis, adolescents stand to benefit from vaccination against both pathogens. Co-administration of MenACWY-TT Nimenrix with Boostrix (Tdap) was evaluated in male and female subjects aged between 11 and 25 years (adolescents and adults) in a separate clinical study. The current study MenACWY-TT-054 evaluated an unprecedented co-administration of Nimenrix , Cervarix and Boostrix as compared to administration of Nimenrix and Cervarix vaccines alone in females from 9 to 25 years of age. The current SmPC of Cervarix does not include any information on the co-administration of Cervarix with meningococcal vaccine. Co-administration of the three vaccines may contribute to improve the implementation and coverage of adolescent vaccination programmes.

This phase III study was meant to assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of Nimenrix administered alone as compared to Nimenrix co-administered with Cervarix or co-administered with Cervarix and Tdap Boostrix in female adolescents and young adults at 9-25 years of age.

All the co-primary objectives were met except one. In the primary analysis, non-inferiority of Cervarix co-administered with MenACWY-TT compared to Cervarix administered alone in terms of HPV16 and HPV18 GMTs as measured by ELISA one month after the third dose of Cervarix was demonstrated.

Also, non-inferiority of Cervarix co-administered with Nimenrix and Boostrix compared to Cervarix coadministered with Boostrix was demonstrated.

Non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of Boostrix co-administered with Nimenrix and Cervarix (Co-ad group) was not demonstrated as compared to Boostrix co-administered with Cervarix (Tdap group) with respect to GMC to each discrete pertussis antigen (PT, FHA and PRN) one month after Boostrix vaccination. The co-administration of Tdap Boostrix with Nimenrix and Cervarix one month later tended to elicit lower anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN GMCs as compared to Boostrix co-administered with Cervarix alone. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known.

As in the secondary analysis, the response rates and GMC fold increase between pre- and postvaccination showed robust responses to vaccination for each pertussis antigen in both groups (Co-ad group and Tdap group), suggesting - according to the MAH - that the statistically significant differences are not deemed to be clinically relevant.

According to the Rapporteur, the SmPC of Cervarix should address these results and uncertainty. Indeed, the section 4.5 should provide information on the potential for clinically relevant interactions based on the pharmacodynamic properties and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies of the vaccines studied. Specifically, the existence or not of clinically relevant interference in the antibody response when coadministration occurs should be adequately addressed.

The current SmPC of Cervarix does not include any information on the co-administration of Cervarix with meningococcal vaccine. Meanwhile, information on the co-administartion of Cervarix with a Boostrix or Boostrix polio - with no clinically relevant interference with antibody response to any of the components of either vaccine - is included in section 4.5 of SmPC of Cervarix. Also, other coadministration with Cervarix were addressed (combined hepatitis A (inactivated) and hepatitis B (rDNA) vaccine (Twinrix) or with hepatitis B (rDNA) vaccine) (Engerix B).

However, the MAH does not consider an update of the SmPC with co-administration of Cervarix with meningococcal vaccine as relevant because of the limited use / limited number of European countries having a recommendation for quadrivalent meningococcal vaccination in adolescents.

The rationale of the MAH cannot be supported and endorsed by the Rapporteur. This study provides new data regarding co-administration of Cervarix, i e with Nimenrix and with Nimenrix+Boostrix, which warrants an update of its SmPC. Therefore, the MAH is requested to address the results of this study MenACWY-TT-054 especially since non-inferiority of Boostrix co-administered with MenACWYTT and Cervarix compared to Boostrix co-administered with Cervarix with respect to Geometric mean concentration (GMC) to each discrete pertussis antigen (pertussis toxoid [PT], filamentous hemagglutinin [FHA] and pertactin [PRN]) one month after Boostrix vaccination was not demonstrated although the clinical relevance is unknown. The MAH is required to present a type II variation to update section 4.5 of the Cervarix SmPC.

## MS comments

It is agreed with the Rapporteur that the SmPC section 4.5 of Cervarix should be updated with the information from this study.

Although the MAH argued that use of quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine in adolescents is limited in EU, this appears to be changing with the upcoming Men W. For example in the Netherlands it has recently been decided to vaccinate in 2018 one year cohort of adolescents with a Men ACWY vaccine. It

is important for prescribers to know that there is no immune interference between the two vaccines observed.

In addition although the clinical relevance of the lower pertussis response (PT,FHA, PRN) with coadministration of all three vaccines is not known, it is recommended to add this information in the SmPC, because the current information mentions that no interference was found by concomitantly administration of Cervarix and dTpa(-IPV) vaccines while sequential administration resulted in lower anti-HPV16 and anti-HPV-18 response.

## MAH response to the assessment comments

After internal discussions, the MAH now agrees to update the interaction section of the Cervarix SmPC with these new available co-administration data.

## CHMP conclusion

As requested, the commitment in this article 46 procedure P46 093 to update the Cervarix SmPC with the data from study MenACWY-TT-054 in a new type II variation is accepted by the MAH and therefore this PAM is fulfilled.
