## 1. Executive Summary

This document contains the assessment of the first round responses by the MAH. No SmPC and PL changes are proposed.

## 2. Rapporteur's Overall Conclusion AND RECOMMENDATION

The MAH submitted the results of a double-blind, randomised, multicentre study to assess safety and immunogenicity of 2 new formulations of the MAH's DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine compared to the licensed Infanrix Hexa vaccine when co-administered with Prevenar 13 to healthy infants as a primary vaccination course at 2, 3 and 4 months of age.

The primary objective, i.e. non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of at least one of the novel DTPaHBV-IPV/Hib vaccine formulations compared to the licensed Infanrix Hexa vaccine, was not met according to the criteria set for non-inferiority, as the immune response to the pertactin component of both novel formulations was not non-inferior to Infanrix Hexa. No divergent safety signals were detected in the comparison of the new formulation with the licensed Infanrix Hexa.

The MAH should continue to investigate in pertussis vaccines that offer prolonged protection compared to the currently authorised vaccines in view of the resurgence of pertussis in fully vaccinated individuals which appears to be at least partly due to waning vaccine-induced immunity (Cherry, 2012).

A request for supplementary information was provided to the MAH, who is at current not able to submit a sufficiently detailed answer. A full report will be submitted by the MAH once all relevant data have been captured.

No changes in the SmPC are warranted.

## 3. Request for supplementary information

Request for supplementary information : In view of failure to show non-inferiority for both new formulations against the approved formulation in relation to immunogenicity, the applicant should clarify backup development strategy and consequential deliverables.

## 4. MAH's RESponses to the RSI

## Question No. 1 - Regulatory

In view of failure to show non-inferiority for both new formulations against the approved formulation in relation to immunogenicity, the applicant should clarify backup development strategy and consequential deliverables.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Company's answer: The Company has put on hold any further clinical development. Pre-clinical investigations are currently ongoing to try to identify the root cause for these observed differences. A comprehensive data pack will be available in 1H2013 to allow planning for the next steps.

CHMP's comment: The MAH's results are awaited for further evaluation.
