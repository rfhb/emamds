## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

VeraSeal solutions for sealant

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Component 1:

Human fibrinogen

80 mg/ml

Component 2:

Human thrombin

500 IU/ml

Produced from the plasma of human donors.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Solutions for sealant.

Frozen solutions. After thawing, the solutions are clear or slightly opalescent and colourless or pale yellow.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Supportive treatment in patients where standard surgical techniques are insufficient:

- for improvement of haemostasis.
- as suture support: in vascular surgery.

VeraSeal is indicated in all age groups.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

The use of VeraSeal is restricted to experienced surgeons who have been trained in the use of this medicinal product.

## Posology

The volume of VeraSeal to be applied and the frequency of application should always be oriented towards the underlying clinical needs for the patient.

The dose to be applied is governed by variables including, but not limited to, the type of surgical intervention, the size of the area and the mode of intended application, and the number of applications.

Application of the product must be individualised by the treating physician. In clinical trials, the individual doses have typically ranged from 0.3 to 12 ml. For other procedures, larger volumes may be required.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The initial volume of the product to be applied at a chosen anatomic site or target surface area should be sufficient to entirely cover the intended application area. The application can be repeated, if necessary.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of VeraSeal in children aged 0 to 18 years has  been evaluated in a clinical study. Currently available data are described in section 5.1. Application of the product must be individualised by the treating physician. In the paediatric clinical trial, the individual dose ranged from 0.6 to 12 mL.

Method of administration

For epilesional use.

For instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. The product should only be administered according to the instructions and with the devices recommended for this product (see section 6.6.).

Prior to applying VeraSeal, the surface area of the wound needs to be dried by standard techniques (e.g. intermittent application of compresses, swabs, use of suction devices).

For spray application, see sections 4.4 and 6.6 for specific recommendations on the required distance from tissue per surgical procedure.

## 4.3 Contraindications

VeraSeal must not be applied intravascularly.

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

VeraSeal must not be used for the treatment of severe or brisk arterial bleeding.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Precautions for use

For epilesional use only. Do not apply intravascularly.

Life threatening thromboembolic complications may occur if the preparation is unintentionally applied intravascularly (see section 4.8).

VeraSeal spray application should only be used if it is possible to accurately judge the spray distance, especially during laparoscopy. Spray distance from tissue should be within the range recommended by the marketing authorisation holder of VeraSeal (see section 6.6).

When using accessory tips, the instructions for use of the tips should be followed.

Before administration of VeraSeal, care must be taken that the parts of the body outside the desired application area are sufficiently protected (covered) to prevent tissue adhesion at undesired sites.

VeraSeal should be applied as a thin layer. Excessive clot thickness may negatively interfere with the product's efficacy and the wound healing process.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Adequate data are not available to support the use of this product in tissue gluing, neurosurgery, application through a flexible endoscope for treatment of bleeding or in gastrointestinal anastomoses.

## Hypersensitivity reactions

As with any protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Signs of hypersensitivity reactions include hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur, the administration must be discontinued immediately. In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.

## Transmissible agents

Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma pools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation /removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens.

The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A virus. The measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19. Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (foetal infection) and for individuals with immunodeficiency or increased erythropoiesis (e.g. haemolytic anaemia).

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No formal interaction studies have been performed. Similar to comparable products or thrombin solutions, the product may be denatured after exposure to solutions containing alcohol, iodine or heavy metals (e.g. antiseptic solutions). Such substances should be removed to the greatest possible extent before applying the product.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

The safety of fibrin sealant/haemostatic products for use in human pregnancy or breast-feeding has not been established in controlled clinical trials. Experimental animal studies are insufficient to assess the safety with respect to reproduction, development of the embryo or foetus, the course of gestation and peri- and post-natal development. Therefore, the product should be administered to pregnant and breast-feeding women only if clearly needed.

## Fertility

Fertility studies have not been conducted.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

VeraSeal has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the application site, bronchospasm, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) may

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

occur in rare cases in patients treated with fibrin sealant/haemostatic products. In isolated cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis. Such reactions may especially be seen, if the preparation is applied repeatedly, or administered to patients known to be hypersensitive to constituents of the product.

Antibodies against components of fibrin sealant/haemostatic products may occur rarely.

Inadvertent intravascular injection could lead to thromboembolic event and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and there is also a risk of anaphylactic reaction (see section 4.4).

For safety information with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and Preferred Term Level).

Frequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention:

- -Very common (≥ 1/10)
- -common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10)
- -uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100)
- -rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000)
- -very rare (&lt; 1/10,000)
- -not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing of seriousness.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antihaemorrhagics, local hemostatics, ATC code: B02BC

## Mechanism of action

The fibrin adhesion system initiates the last phase of physiological blood coagulation. Conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin occurs by the splitting of fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and fibrinopeptides. The fibrin monomers aggregate and form a fibrin clot. Factor XIIIa, which is activated from factor XIII by thrombin, crosslinks fibrin. Calcium ions are required for both, the conversion of fibrinogen and the crosslinkage of fibrin.

As wound healing progresses, increased fibrinolytic activity is induced by plasmin and decomposition of fibrin to fibrin degradation products is initiated.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

Randomized, single-blind clinical trials with VeraSeal were conducted in subjects undergoing vascular, parenchymous tissue and soft tissue surgery demonstrating haemostasis, and suture support in vascular surgery. Each of these 3 trials enrolled a specific surgery type and recruited mainly adult subjects.

During the vascular surgery study 225 subjects were enrolled and underwent vascular surgical procedures utilizing polytetrafluoroethylene graft material on end-to-side arterial anastomosis or on upper extremity vascular access arterial anastomosis. The mean age of the study population and its standard deviation was 63.2 (9.5) years. The most frequent surgery types were femoral-popliteal bypass grafting, upper extremity vascular access for hemodialysis, and ilio-femoral bypass grafting. VeraSeal was shown to be superior to the control group (manual compression) in achieving hemostasis by 4 minutes. The rate of hemostasis at the target bleeding site by 4 minutes was 76.1% in the VeraSeal treatment group and was 22.8% in the control group.

During parenchymous tissue surgery study 325 subjects were enrolled and underwent liver resections. The mean age of the study population and its standard deviation was 57.9 (14.5) years. VeraSeal was shown to be superior to the control group (oxidized regenerated cellulose) in achieving hemostasis by 4 minutes. The rate of hemostasis at the target bleeding site by 4 minutes was 92.8% in the VeraSeal treatment group and was 80.5% in the control group.

During soft tissue surgery study 327 subjects were enrolled and underwent pelvic and retroperitoneal surgical procedures, and abdominoplasties and mastopexies. The mean age of the study population and its standard deviation was 47.2 (18.4) years. The most frequent surgery types were simple or radical hysterectomies, abdominoplasties, and radical cystectomies. VeraSeal was shown to be non-inferior to the control group (oxidized regenerated cellulose) in achieving hemostasis by 4 minutes. The rate of hemostasis at the target bleeding site by 4 minutes was 82.8% in the VeraSeal treatment group and was 77.8% in the control group.

## Paediatric population

A paediatric randomized, active controlled, single-blind, clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VeraSeal as an adjunct to haemostasis during open parenchyma (hepatic) surgery or soft tissue surgery. A total of 178 children (&lt; 18 years of age) were randomized and treated with VeraSeal (n=91) or active control (n=87). Of the 91 subjects treated with VeraSeal, 4 were ≤ 27 days; 19 were ≥ 28 days to ≤ 23 months; 32 were ≥ 2years to ≤ 11 years; 36 were ≥ 12 years to ≤ 17 years. Forty-six children treated with VeraSeal underwent parenchyma (hepatic) surgical procedures and 45 had soft tissue surgeries. VeraSeal was shown to be non-inferior to the control group (EVICEL [sealant]) in achieving hemostasis by 4 minutes. The rate of hemostasis at the target

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

bleeding site by 4 minutes was 96.7% (88/91 subjects) in the VeraSeal treatment group and was 95.4% (83/87) in the control group.

Additionally in the 3 previously described studies mainly in adult subjects that evaluated VeraSeal by specific surgery type eleven paediatric subjects aged 16 years or younger were treated with VeraSeal.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

VeraSeal is intended for epilesional use only. Intravascular administration is contraindicated. Consequently, intravascular pharmacokinetic studies were not performed in man.

Fibrin sealant/haemostatic products are metabolised in the same way as endogenous fibrin by fibrinolysis and phagocytosis.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology and acute toxicity.

## · Administration

Apply VeraSeal using the syringe holder and plunger supplied.

Apply VeraSeal using the Dual Applicator provided with the product. Other CE-marked applicator tips (including open surgery and laparoscopic use devices) intended for specific use with VeraSeal may also be used. When using the provided Dual Applicator, follow the connection instructions described above. When using other applicator tips, follow the instructions for use that are provided with the applicator tips.

## Application by spraying

1. Grasp and bend the Dual Applicator to the desired position. Tip will retain its shape.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2. Position the Airless Spray Tip at least 2 cm away from the target tissue. Apply firm even pressure to the plunger to spray the fibrin sealant. Increase distance accordingly to achieve desired coverage of the target area.
3. If expression is stopped for any reason, change the Airless Spray Tip prior to resuming application since a clot may form inside the Airless Spray Tip. To change the Airless Spray Tip, remove the device from the patient and unscrew the used Airless Spray Tip. See Figure 7. Place the used Airless Spray Tip away from the spare Airless Spray Tips. Wipe the end of the applicator using dry or moist sterile surgical gauze. Then, connect a new Airless Spray Tip provided in the package and ensure it is firmly connected before use.

NOTE: Red indicator will not be visible if Airless Spray Tip is properly connected. See Figure 8.

## B. PACKAGE LEAFLET

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Package leaflet: Information for the user

## VeraSeal solutions for sealant human fibrinogen/human thrombin

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What VeraSeal is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you are treated with VeraSeal
3. How VeraSeal is used
4. Possible side effects
5. How VeraSeal is stored
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What VeraSeal is and what it is used for

VeraSeal contains human fibrinogen and human thrombin, two proteins extracted from the blood that form a clot when they are mixed together.

VeraSeal is used as a sealant during surgical operations in patients. It is applied to the surface of bleeding tissue to reduce bleeding during and after the operation when standard surgical techniques are not sufficient.

VeraSeal is indicated in all age groups.

## 2. What you need to know before you are treated with VeraSeal

## Your surgeon must not treat you with VeraSeal

- -if you are allergic to human fibrinogen or human thrombin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

VeraSeal must not be applied inside blood vessels.

VeraSeal must not be used to treat severe or rapid bleeding from an artery.

## Warnings and precautions

Allergic reactions are possible. Signs of such reactions include hives, rash, tightness of the chest, wheezing, drop in blood pressure (e.g. light-headedness, fainting, blurred vision), and anaphylaxis (a severe reaction with a rapid onset). If these symptoms occur during surgery, the use of the medicine should be stopped immediately.

VeraSeal spray application should only be used if it is possible to accurately judge the spray distance. The spray device should not be used closer than the recommended distance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special safety warning

For medicines such as VeraSeal that are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are taken to prevent infections being passed on to patients. These include carefully selecting blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and testing each donation and pooled plasma for signs of virus/infections. Manufacturers also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections.

The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A virus. The measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19. Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (fetal infection) and for individuals whose immune system is depressed or who have some types of anaemia (e.g. sickle cell disease or haemolytic anaemia).

It is strongly recommended that every time you are treated with VeraSeal, the name and batch number of the medicine are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used.

## Children and adolescents

VeraSeal is recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.

## Other medicines and VeraSeal

The product may be affected after contacting solutions containing alcohol, iodine or heavy metals (e.g. antiseptic solutions).

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before being treated with this medicine. Your doctor will decide whether you should be treated with VeraSeal.

## 3. How VeraSeal is used

The use of VeraSeal is restricted to experienced surgeons who have been trained in the use of VeraSeal.

The surgeon will apply VeraSeal to the surface of blood vessels or to the tissue surface of internal organs using an application device during the course of the operation. This device allows equal amounts of the two components of VeraSeal to be administered at the same time, and ensures that they mix evenly, which is important for the sealant to work at its best.

The amount of VeraSeal that will be applied depends on a number of factors, including the type of surgery, the size of the area to be treated during your operation and the way VeraSeal is applied. The surgeon will decide how much is appropriate, and will apply just enough to form a thin, even layer. If it does not seem to be enough, a second layer can be applied.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

VeraSeal contains the component of fibrin sealant. Fibrin sealants may, in rare cases (up to 1 in 1,000 people), cause an allergic reaction. If you experience an allergic reaction you might have one or more of the following symptoms: swelling under skin (angioedema), skin rash, hives or wheals (nettle-rash), tightness of the chest, chills, flushing, headache, low blood pressure, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, heart rate increase, tingling, vomiting or wheezing. In isolated cases, these reactions may progress to a severe allergic reaction. Allergic reactions may especially be seen if the preparation is applied repeatedly, or administered to patients known to be allergic to constituents of the product. If you experience any of these symptoms after surgery, you should immediately consult your doctor or surgeon.

There is also a theoretical possibility that your immune system will produce proteins to attack VeraSeal and, that these may interfere with your blood clotting. The frequency of this type of event is not known.

If this product is accidentally placed inside a blood vessel, it can lead to blood clots, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (when blood clots form throughout the blood vessels in the body). There is also a risk of a severe allergic reaction.

Side effects which were reported during clinical trials with VeraSeal included:

## Most serious side effects

Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):

- -Cellulitis (infection of the skin)
- -Deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the blood vessels)
- -Liver abscess (swollen area in the liver caused by infection)
- -Peritonitis (inflammation of the wall of the abdomen)
- -Positive parvovirus B19 test (laboratory result showing infection with the virus)
- -Postoperative wound infection
- -Pulmonary embolism (blood clots in blood vessels in the lungs)
- -Wound infection

## Other side effects

Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):

- -Nausea
- -Pain caused by the surgery
- -Pruritus (itching)

Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

## Posology and method of administration

The use of VeraSeal is restricted to experienced surgeons who have been trained in the use of this medicinal product.

The volume of VeraSeal to be applied and the frequency of application should always be oriented towards the underlying clinical needs for the patient.

The dose to be applied is governed by variables including, but not limited to, the type of surgical intervention, the size of the area and the mode of intended application, and the number of applications.

Application of the product must be individualised by the treating physician. In clinical trials, the individual doses have typically ranged from 0.3 to 12 ml. For other procedures, larger volumes may be required.

The initial volume of the product to be applied at a chosen anatomic site or target surface area should be sufficient to entirely cover the intended application area. VeraSeal should be applied as a thin layer. The application can be repeated, if necessary.

## Incompatibilities

This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products.

## Special precautions

For epilesional use only. Do not apply intravascularly.

Life threatening thromboembolic complications may occur if the preparation is unintentionally applied intravascularly.

When using accessory tips, the instructions for use of the tips should be followed.

Before administration of VeraSeal, care must be taken that the parts of the body outside the desired application area are sufficiently protected (covered) to prevent tissue adhesion at undesired sites.

VeraSeal should be applied as a thin layer. Excessive clot thickness may negatively interfere with the product's efficacy and the wound healing process.

## Instructions for use

Read this leaflet before you open the package. Please see pictograms at the end of this leaflet.

## Handling of VeraSeal

VeraSeal comes ready to use in sterilized packages and must be handled using sterile technique in aseptic conditions. Discard damaged packages as re-sterilisation is not possible.

## · Administration

Apply VeraSeal using the syringe holder and plunger supplied.

Apply VeraSeal using the Dual Applicator provided with the product. Other CE-marked applicator tips (including open surgery and laparoscopic use devices) intended for specific use with VeraSeal may also be used. When using the provided Dual Applicator, follow the connection instructions described above. When using other applicator tips, follow the instructions for use that are provided with the applicator tips.

## Application by spraying

1. Grasp and bend the Dual Applicator to the desired position. Tip will retain its shape.
2. Position the Airless Spray Tip at least 2 cm away from the target tissue. Apply firm even pressure to the plunger to spray the fibrin sealant. Increase distance accordingly to achieve desired coverage of the target area.
3. If expression is stopped for any reason, change the Airless Spray Tip prior to resuming application since a clot may form inside the Airless Spray Tip. To change the Airless Spray Tip, remove the device from the patient and unscrew the used Airless Spray Tip. See Figure 7. Place the used Airless Spray Tip away from the spare Airless Spray Tips. Wipe the end of the applicator using dry or moist sterile surgical gauze. Then, connect a new Airless Spray Tip provided in the package and ensure it is firmly connected before use.

NOTE: Red indicator will not be visible if Airless Spray Tip is properly connected. See Figure 8.

NOTE: Do not continue pushing the plunger in an attempt to clear the fibrin clot within the Airless Spray Tip; otherwise the applicator may become unusable.

NOTE: Do not trim the Dual Applicator to avoid exposing internal wire.

## Application by dripping

1. Remove the Airless Spray Tip portion of the spray and drip tip by unscrewing the Airless Spray Tip. See Figure 7.
2. Grasp and bend the drip tip to the desired position. Tip will retain its shape.
3. During dripping, keep the end of the drip tip as close to the tissue surface as possible without touching the tissue during application.
4. Apply individual drops to the surface area to be treated. To prevent uncontrolled clotting, allow the drops to separate from each other and from the end of the drip tip. NOTE: Do not reconnect a used drip tip after it has been removed from the adapter; otherwise a clot may form inside the drip tip and the applicator may become unusable.
