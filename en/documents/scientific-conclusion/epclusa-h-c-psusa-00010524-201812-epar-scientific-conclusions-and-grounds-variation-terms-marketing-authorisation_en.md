## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for sofosbuvir / velpatasvir, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Decrease in immunosuppressive therapy concentrations requiring dose modification has been observed during  the  course  of  hepatitis  C  treatment  in  patients  taking  tacrolimus,  as  immunosuppressant,  and direct-acting  antivirals  (DAA),  such  as  sofosbuvir  /  velpatasvir.  Based  on  the  absorption,  distribution, metabolism and excretion profile of immunosuppressant drugs and sofosbuvir / velpatasvir, a significant pharmacokinetic interaction between these agents is not expected, as reflected in current SmPC of Epclusa. However,  the  sustained  inflammatory  response  associated  with  hepatitis  C  infection  may  lead  to downregulation of certain drug-metabolizing enzymes, including CYP3A. Initiation of DAA-based therapy leads to a rapid viral clearance, normalization of liver function tests and a reduction in inflammation, which thereby  leads  to  enhanced  metabolism  of  CYP3A  substrates,  such  as  tacrolimus.  Owing  to  the  narrow therapeutic index of tacrolimus, appropriate clinical monitoring and management of immunosuppression with tacrolimus or other drugs with a narrow therapeutic margin that are metabolized by the liver should be carried out.

The Product Information does not make specific recommendations to dose adjustment of immunosuppressive  agents  at  initiation  of  co-administration,  but  prescribers  should  be  aware  of  the potential  impact  of  direct-acting  antiviral  therapy  on  immunosuppressive  drug  levels  (and  other  drugs metabolized by the liver) during therapy, so that they are better alerted on the potential need for dose adjustment.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for sofosbuvir / velpatasvir the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing sofosbuvir / velpatasvir is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
