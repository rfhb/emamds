## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for sulfur hexafluoride, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on PEG allergy from the literature, spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers that the warning section  should be amended to  highlight  the  role of  PEG in the  occurrence of rare but  serious hypersensitivity reactions and to strengthen the existing wording about hypersensitivity reactions.

The PRAC concluded that  the  product information of  products containing sulfur  hexafluoride should be amended accordingly.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for sulfur hexafluoride the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing sulfur hexafluoride is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
