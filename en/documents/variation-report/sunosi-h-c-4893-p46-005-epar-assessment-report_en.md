## 1. Introduction

This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH:

The MAH submitted a post-authorisation measure (PAM) for Study JZP865-101 to satisfy the requirements of Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006.

Study JZP865-101 is part of the agreed EU Paediatric Investigation Plan development program for Sunosi (EMEA-002184-PIP01-17).

Sunosi was approved via a centralised procedure on 16/01/2020. It is indicated

- to improve wakefulness and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in adult patients with narcolepsy (with or without cataplexy)

and

- to improve wakefulness and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adult patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) whose EDS has not been satisfactorily treated by primary OSA therapy, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

## 2. Summary of data submitted

An Open-label, Single Ascending Dose Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Solriamfetol in Pediatric Subjects With Narcolepsy (Study No. JZP865-101, EudraCT No. 2019-003008-11)

Study JZP865-101 was a phase 2a, multi-centre, open-label, 3-period, fixed-sequence, single ascending dose (SAD) study to evaluate the efficacy, PK, and safety of solriamfetol in pediatric participants (6 to &lt; 18 years old) with narcolepsy. It was sponsored by Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, CA.

Study JZP865-101 was designed to characterize the PK in pediatric participants and evaluate the safety profile, to inform dose selection for future pediatric studies, and to provide preliminary efficacy data on solriamfetol in the pediatric population.

Dose selection for this study was based on population PK simulations from adult PK data and the calculated safety margins from the juvenile toxicology study.

A total of 4 centres from France, Belgium, and Italy enrolled and dosed participants in this study.

The study comprised the following periods:

Screening Period for up to 28 days, 3 Treatment Periods during which participants were administered ascending doses of study intervention, and an End of Study Period (7 ± 2 days after Period 3 dose) to collect final safety evaluations. Each Period begins at Day -1 for Check-in. Single doses are administered on Day 1, followed by safety and efficacy testing for up to 10 hours on the same Day. Periods are separated by wash-out periods of 14 ± 2 days.

Figure 1 Design of Study JZP865-101

<!-- image -->

Pediatric participants with a diagnosis of narcolepsy according to ICSD-3 criteria, or with the permission of the medical monitor, completed a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) during screening to confirm the diagnosis of narcolepsy by ICSD-3 criteria (ie, the participant met all other ICSD-3 criteria for narcolepsy).

Twelve pediatric participants who satisfied all eligibility criteria, 6 participants in each age group received study intervention. During screening, an attempt was made to enrol an equal number of male and female participants in each group as well as to enrol at least 2 participants below the age of 9.

- Group 1 : adolescents 12 to &lt; 18 years old
- Group 2 : children 6 to &lt; 12 years old)

Table 1 Treatment and Dosing Schedule (Solriamfetol)

| Age Group                        | Period 1   | Period 2   | Period 3   |
|----------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Group 1, 12 to< 18 years (N = 6) | 75 mg      | 150 mg     | 300 mg     |
| Group2,6 to<12years (N = 6)      | 37.5 mg    | 75 mg      | 150 mg     |

Each participant received 3 ascending doses of solriamfetol, a single dose in each Treatment Period, with a Washout Period of 14 ± 2 days separating the consecutive dosing Treatment Periods within each age group. To minimize intra- and inter-participant variability, the single dose was administered with 240 mL of water in the morning approximately 2 hours after completing a light breakfast.

The bioanalytical analyses were performed by a central bioanalytical laboratory. Determination of solriamfetol in plasma was performed using validated methods consisting of extraction and then analysis using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The bioanalytical method measured solriamfetol in human matrix over 8.42-4210 ng/mL (10.0-5,000 ng/mL for HCl salt) (refer to Bioanalytical Method Validation). Details of the sample analysis are presented in the Bioanalytical Study Report.

## Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic, and Safety Assessments (Periods 1, 2, and 3)

Each subject in each age group will receive 3 single oral doses of solriamfetol (if tolerated) during 3 separate periods, in an ascending manner. Dosing in Group 2 (children 6 to &lt; 12 years old) will not start until the dosing in Group 1 (adolescents 12 to &lt; 18 years old) is complete.

Within Group 1 and Group 2, each subject will be allowed to dose escalate from Period 1 to Period 2 and from Period 2 to Period 3 independently of other subjects in the same group. Within each age group, however, not more than 2 subjects can receive the same dose at the same time. A safety evaluation for each subject will be performed by the Safety Review Committee, composed of the principal investigator (or designee) and Jazz medical/clinical staff, before the next higher dose can be received for each subject. The safety evaluation will also include all available safety data from all subjects at any dose level.

In performing these safety evaluations as each subject dose escalates from a lower to a higher dose, the Safety Review Committee will review each subject's safety data in alignment with the known safety profile of solriamfetol. The safety data will include, but not be limited to, vital signs, ECGs, C-SSRS, and AEs. Once each safety review has concluded that adequate safety and tolerability have been demonstrated, each subject will be permitted to proceed to the next higher dose.

Once the last subject in Group 1 has completed the last study period, PK will be assessed for all subjects in this group. The safety, tolerability, and PK data from all subjects/doses in Group 1 will be reviewed by the Safety Review Committee before dosing can begin in Group 2.

For both Group 1 and Group 2, if 1 subject experiences a study drug-related serious adverse event (SAE), dosing at that level will be withheld until a full safety evaluation is performed and dose continuation at that level is deemed to be safe by the Safety Review Committee.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Efficacy will be assessed by the Pictoral Sleepiness Scale (PSS) and Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIc) for all subjects (Group 1 and Group 2) in Periods 1, 2, and 3.

The PSS is a pictorial scale used to measure instantaneous perceived sleepiness. The assessment consists of 5 cartoon faces depicting increasing degrees of sleepiness. The faces are designed to be devoid of gender and ethnic features (Maldonado 2004). Use of pictorial representations of sleepiness was selected to facilitate self-report by young children, who may have difficulty completing a verbal or geometric (visual analogue) scale. Subjects will choose the face that best describes how sleepy or alert they feel at that time. Each response will be converted to a numerical ranked score for analysis. For each dosing period, the Day 1 pre-dose assessment will be considered baseline for comparison with the post-dose assessments.

Below, the faces are shown in order from most alert to most sleepy (A through E, with A corresponding to most alert and E corresponding to most sleepy). For statistical analysis, each choice is converted to its corresponding numerical value.

The CGIc is a 5-point Likert-type rating scale widely used to assess efficacy in clinical studies. For each period, investigators will rate their impression of any change in the subject's overall sleepiness on dosing day compared to overall baseline (Day -1) sleepiness on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = much improved to 5 = much worse (CGIc: 1 = Much Improved, 2 = Minimally Improved, 3 = No Change, 4 = Minimally Worse, 5 = Much worse). The CGIc will be performed on dosing day at approximately 10 hours post-dose, and the investigator should consider the subject's sleepiness across the entire dosing day comparing to the day before.

## Disposition of Participants

Fourteen potential participants were screened for this study; 2 failed to meet all entry criteria. A total of 12 participants were enrolled and dosed from 4 centers in the EU (France, Belgium, and Italy), and all 12 participants completed the study.

## Protocol Amendment

Efficacy assessments were added as part of Global Amendment 2 of the study protocol (implemented only at sites in Belgium and Italy) when participants from Group 1 had either completed follow-up or were still being followed in the study. Hence, only 1 participant from Group 1 has efficacy data available from a single period (Period 3; 300 mg). Because of this, efficacy data are only presented intext for Group 2 (6 to &lt; 12 years old).

## Safety

Treatment-emergent AEs are summarized by group (Group 1 [12 to &lt; 18 years old] versus Group 2 [6 to &lt; 12 years old]) and solriamfetol dose in the Table below. Overall, solriamfetol was well tolerated, with no serious TEAEs, no severe TEAEs, and no TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation. All subjects tolerated the full course of doses, and no subjects were unable to complete the study due to tolerability issues. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, or ECG parameters.

Abbreviations: h = hour; N = number of participants in the given population and treatment group; SD = standard deviation.

Note: Period 1 treatment = 75 mg for Group 1, 37.5 mg for Group 2; Period 2 treatment = 150 mg for Group 1, 75 mg for Group 2; Period 3 treatment = 300 mg for Group 1, 150 mg for Group 2.

Median plasma solriamfetol concentrations increased proportionally with increasing doses in both Group 1 (12 to &lt; 18 years old) and Group 2 (6 to &lt; 12 years old). Median Tmax was similar across groups, with values ranging from 1.02 to 2.56 hours across all dose levels. Group 1 t½ was similar

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

across dose levels, with mean t½ ranging from 9.06 to 9.82 hours. Group 2 t½ was also similar across dose levels, with mean t½ ranging from 4.06 to 4.70 hours.

At the same dose (75 mg and 150 mg), exposure (AUC and Cmax) for Group 2 was higher than Group 1.

## 3. Scientific discussion

Study JZP865-101 was submitted as a post-authorisation measure (PAM) to satisfy the requirements of Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 as part of the agreed EU Paediatric Investigation Plan development program for Sunosi (EMEA-002184-PIP01-17).

The study was designed to characterize the PK in pediatric participants and evaluate the safety profile, to inform dose selection for future pediatric studies, and to provide preliminary efficacy data on solriamfetol in the pediatric population.

Entry criteria were adequately defined. Participating pediatric patients are representative for targeted population. Eligible subjects completed a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) during screening to confirm the diagnosis of narcolepsy by ICSD-3 criteria (ie, the participant met all other ICSD-3 criteria for narcolepsy). Median time since initial narcolepsy diagnosis was less in the younger participants than in the older participants (median of 36.283 months in Group 2 versus 68.125 months in Group 1).

Twelve pediatric participants who satisfied all eligibility criteria, 6 participants in each age group (Group 1: adolescents 12 to &lt; 18 years old; Group 2: children 6 to &lt; 12 years old) received study intervention. During screening, an attempt was made to enrol an equal number of male (n=5) and female (n=7) participants in each group as well as to enrol at least 2 participants below the age of 9.

All 12 participants received a single dose of 3 ascending dose levels of solriamfetol (Group 1: 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg solriamfetol; Group 2: 37.5 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg solriamfetol) during the course of the study.

It was planned to measure efficacy by means of 2 co-primary endpoints, i.e. the Pictoral Sleepiness Scale (PSS) and Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIc) for all subjects (Group 1 and Group 2) in Periods 1, 2, and 3. However, efficacy assessments were only added as part of Global Amendment 2 of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the study protocol when participants from Group 1 had either completed follow-up or were still being followed in the study. Hence, efficacy data are presented only for Group 2 (6 to &lt; 12 years old).

In terms of the Pictorial Sleepiness Scale (PSS), numerical improvements (as change from baseline) could be shown for the 75 mg and 150 mg dose. However, there are strong limitations as concerns meaningfulness of data. These relate to the small dataset in general (n=12), availability of efficacy results for only half the population (Group 2, N=5), and the low level of sleepiness expressed by the subjects at baseline. Included subjects were rather on the alert side of the scale at baseline with PSS values between 1 and 2.1.

The co-primary endpoint (CGIc) demonstrated that subjects were much improved (CGIc 1.0 for 150 mg) or minimally improved (CGIc 2.2 for 37.5 mg). A CGIc score of 3 would correspond to 'no change'.

Overall, it is concluded that due to limitations (small dataset) efficacy results are considered exploratory.

In terms of safety, solriamfetol was well tolerated, with no serious TEAEs, no severe TEAEs, and no TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation. All subjects tolerated the full course of doses, and no subjects were unable to complete the study due to tolerability issues. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, or ECG parameters. The impact of solriamfetol on vital signs such as blood pressure and heart rate was an issue of discussion at the time of approval of solriamfetol, in particular as concerns the use for treatment of daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), since these often present with relevant cardiovascular comorbidity. In the small pediatric dataset of study JZP865-101, no clinically meaningful change in BP or HR was observed.

The pharmacokinetics of solriamfetol in the pediatric population was also analysed. Median plasma solriamfetol concentrations increased proportionally with increasing doses in both Group 1 (12 to &lt; 18 years old) and Group 2 (6 to &lt; 12 years old).

Median Tmax was similar across groups, with values ranging from 1.02 to 2.56 hours across all dose levels. The elimination half life was about twice as long in subjects from 12 to &lt; 18 years (Group 1: t½ ranging from 9.06 to 9.82 hours) as compared to younger subjects from 6 to &lt; 12 years (Group 2: mean t½ranging from 4.06 to 4.70 hours).

Despite the fact that solriamfetol was eliminated faster in younger subjects of Group 2, at the same dose (75 mg and 150 mg), exposure (AUC and Cmax) for Group 2 was higher than Group 1. There appeared to be dose-proportional increases in exposure to solriamfetol following single dose administration of doses ranging from 75 mg to 300 mg in Group 1 (12 to &lt; 18 years old) and doses 37.5 mg to 150 mg in Group 2 (6 to&lt; 12 years old).

## 4. Overall conclusion

Overall, the MAH's conclusion on the outcome of pediatric study JZP865-101 is endorsed. The study, due to its design and limited number of pediatric patients, does not allow drawing conclusions on efficacy or safety that would impact on the drug's B/R ratio or lead to labelling updates. Conversely, the study does support the continued development of solriamfetol for pediatric patients with narcolepsy.
