The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Posology

Individuals from 12 years of age

IXCHIQ is administered as a single dose of 0.5 mL.

Revaccination (Booster dose)

The need for revaccination has not been established.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population aged less than 12 years

The safety and immunogenicity of IXCHIQ in children aged less than 12 years have not been established. No data are available for children below 12 years of age.

## Method of administration

For intramuscular injection only, after reconstitution.

IXCHIQ should be administered intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle within 2 hours of reconstitution.

The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Immunodeficient or immunosuppressed individuals due to disease or medical therapy (e.g., from malignancies, chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy, congenital immunodeficiency, or  HIV infection with severe immunosuppression).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

IXCHIQ should only be given when there is a significant risk of acquiring chikungunya infection, and after careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits (see Section 4.3 and below).

Serious adverse reactions have been reported with the use of IXCHIQ, particularly in individuals aged 65 years and older and in individuals with multiple underlying chronic and/or uncontrolled medical conditions (see section 4.8). Severe reactogenicity or chikungunya-like adverse reactions may lead to deterioration of general condition including malaise and decreased appetite, exacerbation of preexisting diseases, confusional state, encephalopathy, or encephalitis, leading to falls, hospitalisation and death. Vaccinees should be instructed to promptly seek medical attention if they experience, after vaccination, symptoms suggestive of severe reactogenicity or severe chikungunya-like adverse reactions.

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination.

## Anxiety-related reactions

Anxietyrelated reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

The vaccine should be given with caution to individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular injection in these individuals.

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

The ability of IXCHIQ to prevent disease due to chikungunya virus was based on a serological surrogate endpoint (see section 5.1). As with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited after vaccination in all persons. It is recommended to continue personal protection measures against mosquito bites after vaccination.

## Pregnancy

A decision to administer IXCHIQ during pregnancy should take into consideration the individual's risk of wild-type CHIKV infection, gestational age, and risks to the foetus or neonate from vertical transmission of wild-type CHIKV (see section 4.6).

## Blood donation

Vaccine viraemia was detected in 90% of subjects 3 days after vaccination, proportions of vaccinees with detectable virus declined to 17% by 7 days after administration of IXCHIQ and no vaccine viraemia was detected 15 days after vaccination. See sections 4.6 and 4.8. Individuals administered IXCHIQ should not donate blood for at least 4 weeks post-vaccination.

## Chikungunya-like Adverse Reactions

IXCHIQ may cause severe or prolonged chikungunya-like adverse reactions (see section 4.8).

## Encephalitis

Encephalitis (including with fatal outcome) has been reported during post-marketing use of IXCHIQ (see section 4.8).

## Sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodiumfree'.

## Potassium

This medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'potassiumfree'.

This medicine contains 25 mg Sorbitol in each 0.5 mL dose which is equivalent to 0.036 mg Sorbitol/kg/0.5 mL . The additive effect of concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into account.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Concomitant administration with other vaccines

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

IXCHIQ is not recommended to be co-administered with other vaccines because there are no data on the safety and immunogenicity following concomitant administration of IXCHIQ with other vaccines.

Administration of immune globulins, blood or plasma transfusions 3 months before or up to 1 month after IXCHIQ administration may interfere with the expected immune response.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

Animal  studies  did  not  indicate  any  direct  or  indirect  harmful  effects  with  respect  to  reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

There  is  limited  amount  of  data  from  the  use  of  IXCHIQ  in  pregnant  women.  These  data  are  not sufficient  to  conclude  on  the  absence  of  potential  effects  of  IXCHIQ  on  pregnancy,  embryo-foetal development, parturition and post-natal development.

Vertical  transmission  of  wild-type  CHIKV  from  pregnant  individuals  with  viraemia  at  delivery  is common and can cause potentially fatal CHIKV disease in neonates. Vaccine viraemia occurs in the first week following administration of IXCHIQ, with resolution of viraemia by 14 days after vaccination. It is not known if the vaccine virus can be vertically transmitted and cause foetal or neonatal adverse reactions.

Decisions to administer IXCHIQ during pregnancy should take into consideration the individual's risk of  exposure  to  wild-type  CHIKV,  gestational  age,  and  risks  to  the  foetus  or  neonate  from  vertical transmission of wild-type CHIKV.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown if IXCHIQ is excreted in human milk. A risk to the breastfed child cannot be excluded. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for IXCHIQ and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from IXCHIQ.

Animal studies did not indicate any direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to lactation (see section 5.3).

## Fertility

No specific studies have been performed on fertility.

Animal studies did not indicate any harmful effects with respect to female fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

IXCHIQ has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

## Adults ≥ 18 years of age

The overall safety of IXCHIQ is based on an analysis of the pooled safety data from three completed phase I and III clinical studies conducted in the US o n 3 610 participants ≥18 years old who received one dose of IXCHIQ with a follow-up of 6 months.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most common vaccination site reactions were tenderness (10.8%) and pain (6.1%). The most common systemic adverse reactions were headache (32%), fatigue (29.4%), myalgia (23.7%), arthralgia (16.6%), fever (13.8%) and nausea (11.4%).

In the post-marketing setting, serious adverse reactions have been reported, particularly in males aged 65 years and older with underlying chronic medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. These adverse reactions included neurological events such as fatal encephalitis, deterioration of general condition, and exacerbation of chronic medical conditions (see section 4.4).

## Adolescents 12 to &lt;18 years of age

Safety in adolescent participants 12 to &lt;18 years was assessed in 502 participants in Brazil who received one dose of IXCHIQ with a follow-up of 6 months. 18.7% of the participants had pre-existing antibodies against chikungunya virus (94 adolescents).

The most common vaccination site reactions in adolescents 12 to &lt;18 years of age were tenderness (19.9%) and pain (19.3%) . The most common systemic adverse reactions were headache (51.0%), myalgia (26.9%), fever (24.1%), fatigue (22. 3 %), nausea (15.9%), and arthralgia (12.9%).

## Baseline seropositive adolescents

The proportion of participants that experienced solicited systemic AEs was higher in baseline seronegative participants vaccinated with  IXCHIQ than in baseline seropositive participants vaccinated with  IXCHIQ (67.9% and 44.7% respectively). The proportion of participants who experienced solicited local AEs and unsolicited AEs was similar in the IXCHIQ arms of each stratum.

## Laboratory parameters

## Adults ≥ 18 years of age

The most common abnormal laboratory parameters were neutropenia (41.8%), leukopenia (31.2%), lymphopenia (22.3%), Alanine aminotransferase increased (ALT: 15.5%), and Aspartate aminotransferase increased (AST: 11.7%) (based on an immunogenicity subset of 372 IXCHIQ recipients).

## Adolescents 12 to &lt;18 years

The most common abnormal laboratory parameters were neutropenia (40.2%), leukopenia (16.8%), and lymphopenia (11.6%) (based on an immunogenicity subset of 328 IXCHIQ recipients).

## Vaccine Viraemia and Shedding

Vaccine virus was demonstrated to be present in blood and urine and might be present in other body fluids. Vaccine viraemia and shedding (measured by genomic amplification methods) following vaccination with IXCHIQ was assessed in one adult clinical trial (VLA1553 -101). Viraemia was detected in 90% of subjects 3 days after vaccination, proportions of vaccinees with detectable virus declined to 17% by 7 days after administration of IXCHIQ and no vaccine viraemia was detected 15 days after vaccination. A single participant shed vaccine virus in urine 7 days after vaccination.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions are listed according to the following frequency categories:

Very common: ( ≥ 1/10 ), Common: ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10 ), Uncommon: ( ≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100), Rare: ( ≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000), Very rare: (&lt;1/10 000), Not known: (cannot be estimated from available data).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Within  each  frequency  grouping  the  adverse  reactions  are  presented  in  the  order  of  decreasing seriousness.

## Chikungunya-like Adverse Reactions

## Adults

The occurrence of certain adverse event combinations, referred to as chikungunya-like adverse reactions, was retrospectively evaluated in the pooled safety data from phase I and III clinical studies (N=3 610). Chikungunya -like adverse reactions were broadl y defined, i.e. occurrence of fever (≥38°C) and at least one other symptom also reported for acute-stage chikungunya illness, including arthralgia or arthritis, myalgia, headache, back pain, rash, lymphadenopathy, and certain neurological, cardiac or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ocular symptoms; within 30 days after vaccination, regardless of time of onset, severity or duration of the individual symptoms.

Adverse event combinations qualifying as chikungunya-like adverse reactions were reported in 12.1% of participants. Among those, combinations of fever with headache, fatigue, myalgia or arthralgia were the most common, all other symptoms were reported in fewer than 10% of chikungunya-like adverse reactions. The reported symptoms were mostly mild, 1.8% of participants reported at least one severe symptom, most commonly fever or arthralgia. Median onset of chikungunya-like adverse reactions was 3 days after vaccination, and median time to resolution was 4 days. Longer-lasting symptoms ≥30 days occurred in 0.4% of participants.

## Adolescents 12 to &lt;18 years of age

The occurrence of chikungunya-like adverse reactions in adolescents (12 to &lt;18 years) was evaluated in a post-hoc analysis of 502 participants from the phase III study in adolescents. Chikungunya-like adverse reactions in adolescents were defined as fever (≥37.8°C/ 100.0°F) and at least one other symptom also reported for acute-stage chikungunya illness, including arthralgia or arthritis, myalgia, headache, or certain neurological or ocular symptoms, rash, or certain skin symptoms; within 30 days after vaccination, regardless of time of onset, severity or duration of the individual symptoms. Chikungunyalike adverse reactions were reported in 23.1% of adolescents . Among those, combinations of fever with headache, myalgia, fatigue or arthralgia were the most common, all other symptoms were reported in fewer than 10% participants. 3.6 % of participants reported at least one severe symptom, most commonly fever or headache. Median onset of chikungunya-like adverse reactions was 2 days after vaccination, and median time to resolution was 4 days. There were no longer-lasting chikungunya-like adverse reactions reported in adolescents (i.e., at least one symptom with duration ≥30 days).

## Baseline seropositive adolescents

The  proportion  of  participants  that  experienced  chikungunya-like  adverse  reactions  was  higher  in baseline seronegative participants than in baseline seropositive participants vaccinated with IXCHIQ .

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No case of overdose has been reported in clinical studies.  In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other viral vaccines, ATC code: Not yet assigned

## Mechanism of action

IXCHIQ contains live-attenuated CHIKV of the ECSA/IOL genotype. The exact mechanism of protection against CHIKV infection and/or disease has not been determined. IXCHIQ elicits neutralising antibodies against CHIKV.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immunogenicity

No efficacy data are available for IXCHIQ. The clinical efficacy of IXCHIQ was inferred from a postvaccination CHIKV-specific neutralizing antibody titre threshold.

A threshold of CHIKVspecific neutralizing antibody μPRNT50 titre of ≥150 was selected as surrogate marker for protection, referred to as seroresponse. This threshold was determined from a nonhuman primate passive transfer study in which animals with titres ≥150 were protected against wild-type CHIKV infections and had undetectable virus in blood during 14 days after the challenge. In addition, the threshold was supported by data obtained from a prospective human seroepidemiological study.

VLA1553 -301 was a placebo -controlled study assessing the immunogenicity and safety in generally healthy individuals 18 years and above. The study was conducted in the US. Participants in th is study were followed up for 6 months after immunization. The proportion of participants with CHIKVspecific antibody titers ≥150 µPRNT50 , i.e. seroresponse rate, 28 days post-vaccination in the CHIKV participants negative for CHIKV neutralizing antibodies of the IXCHIQ arm was the primary endpoint.

Humoral immune response was evaluated in 362 participants (266 in the IXCHIQ arm and 96 in the Placebo arm). All these participants were negative at baseline (pre -vaccination) for CHIKV neutralizing antibodies. The study population included 82 participants 65 years of age or above (59 and 23 in the IXCHIQ and Placebo arm).

VLA1553 -321 was a placebo -controlled study assessing the immunogenicity and safety in generally healthy adolescents 12 to &lt;18 years of age. The study was conducted in Brazil which is an endemic country for chikungunya. Participants in this study were followed up to 6 months after immunization. The primary endpoint was similar as in study VLA1553 -301 .

Humoral immune response was evaluated in 351 participants (303 in the IXCHIQ arm and 48 in the p lacebo arm). 293 participants were negative, and 58 participants were positive at baseline (prevaccination) for CHIKV neutralizing antibodies.

Antibody persistence is evaluated in study VLA1553 -303 (follow up of a subset of participants of study of VLA1553 -301). Data are available up to 2 years post-immunization. In study VLA1553 -321 a subset of adolescents 12 to &lt;18 years of age will be followed for up to 1 year post-immunization.

## Seroresponse rate

## Adults

In the pivotal trial VLA1553 -301, 98.9% of the participants who were administered IXCHIQ presented CHIKVspecific neutralizing antibody titers ≥150 µPRNT50 at 28 days post -vaccination. This percentage was sustained up to 6 months postvaccination (96.3%). Refer to Table 2. Only 1.6% (n=4/251) of the participants vaccinated with IXCHIQ had CHIKV-specific neutralizing antibody titers ≥150 µPRNT50 at Day 8. No participant had CHIKV -specific neutralizing antibody response ≥150 µPRNT50 in the placebo arm of VLA1553 -301 .

## Adolescents 12 to &lt;18 years of age

In the adolescent trial VLA1553 -321, 98.8% (248/251) of the CHIKV seronegative participants who were administered IXCHIQ presented CHIKVspecific neutralizing antibody titers ≥150 µPRNT50 at 28 days post-vaccination. This percentage was sustained up to 6 months post-vaccination (99.1% (232/234 ). 5.7% (n=14/245) of the CHIKV seronegative participants vaccinated with IXCHIQ had CHIKVspecific neutralizing antibody titers ≥150 µPRNT50 at Day 8. The vast majority of CHIKV seropositive participants (50/52) presented CHIKV-specific neutralizing antibody titers ≥150 µPRNT50 before vaccination with IXCHIQ. The percentages remained in the same range 28 days post-vaccination (52/52) and 6 months post-vaccination (45/46).

## Antibody persistence

Persistence of the immune response was evaluated 12 and 24 months post -vaccination in VLA1553 -303. All the participants were negative at baseline (pre -vaccination) for CHIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies. Proportion of participants with a CHIKV -specific neutralizing antibody response ≥150 µPRNT50 was 99.5% (183/184) and 97.1% (268/276), respectively at 1 and 2 year post -vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with IXCHIQ Vaccine in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in active immunisation for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Not relevant to vaccines.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproduction and developmental toxicity conducted.

A reproductive toxicity trial studying in female rats showed that IXCHIQ administered prior and after mating did not affect the reproductive parameters, the delivery, the foetal or pup development. There was evidence of placental and milk transfer of IXCHIQ-specific antibodies (see section 4.6).

## IXCHIQ powder and solvent for solution for injection

Chikungunya vaccine (live)

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start receiving this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

1. What IXCHIQ is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you receive IXCHIQ
3. How IXCHIQ is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store IXCHIQ
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What IXCHIQ is and what it is used for

IXCHIQ is a vaccine that helps protect adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older against disease caused by the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV).

Chikungunya is a disease that is caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), which is found in the subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa, Southeast Asia, India, and the Pacific Region. CHIKV is spread to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito.  The majority of people infected with CHIKV develop a sudden fever and severe pain in multiple joints. Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or rash.  These symptoms typically resolve within 7 to 10 days, but symptoms may last for months or years.

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first to decide if you should be given this vaccine.

## How the vaccine works

IXCHIQ works by teaching the immune system (the body's natural defences) to defend itself against CHIKV. The vaccine contains a form of the virus that has been weakened in the laboratory so it can not multiply. When the body encounters this weakened version of the virus, the immune system will recognise it and produce antibodies to attack it. When a vaccinated person later comes into contact with the virus, their immune system will recognise it and be ready to defend the body against it. This helps protect them from getting sick.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive IXCHIQ

## The vaccine must not be given:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -If you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6).
- -If your immune system has a reduced ability to fight infections and other diseases (immunodeficiency) or you have a weakened immune system (immunocompromised) because of a disease or a medicine (such as cancer and chemotherapy, use of medicines that weaken the immune system such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, inherited immune problems, or HIV infection).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or, pharmacist or nurse before you receive IXCHIQ:

- -If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction after any other vaccine injection.
- -If you have anxiety related to needles or injections or if you have ever fainted following any injection.
- -If you have a problem with bleeding or bruising, or if you are taking an anticoagulant medicine (to prevent blood clots).
- -If you have a recent onset of fever (body temperature over 38°C). However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold.

Your doctor will carefully weigh the benefits and risks before recommending the vaccine, taking into consideration the risk of infection with the chikungunya virus in the regions where you are living or going to stay. Serious reactions to the vaccine have been reported mostly in persons 65 years and older and in persons with chronic medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or heart disease. Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you experience worsening of your general health or existing diseases (see section 4).

If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine.

Do not donate blood for at least 4 weeks after you have been vaccinated with IXCHIQ.

Inflammation of the brain

Inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) has been observed following vaccination with IXCHIQ. Symptoms may include confusion, sleepiness and seizures accompanied by fever and headache. If you experience any of the above symptoms after vaccination, seek medical attention immediately mentioning that you have recently received IXCHIQ (see Section 4).

Chikungunya-like adverse reactions

IXCHIQ may cause side effects similar to chikungunya disease, which may also be severe or last longer (see Section 4).

IXCHIQ may not fully protect everyone who gets the vaccine. IXCHIQ does not protect against other diseases transmitted by mosquitoes.

You should still protect yourself from mosquito bites even after you have received the IXCHIQ vaccine. When traveling to countries with chikungunya virus, use insect repellent, wear long-sleeved shirts and pants and stay in places with air conditioning or that use window and door screens.

## Children and adolescents

IXCHIQ can be used in adolescents aged 12 years and older. IXCHIQ has not been tested fully in young people under 12 years of age. It should not be used in this age group.

## Other medicines and IXCHIQ

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before receiving this vaccine.

IXCHIQ has not been studied in pregnant women or nursing mothers.

## Driving and using machines

Some of the side effects of IXCHIQ (see section 4) may temporarily affect your ability to drive and use machines. Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell after vaccination. Wait until any effects of the vaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines.

## IXCHIQ contains sodium and potassium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodiumfree'.

This medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'potassiumfree'.

## IXCHIQ contains sorbitol

This medicine contains 25 mg Sorbitol in each 0.5 mL dose which is equivalent to 0.036 mg Sorbitol/kg/0.5 mL. The additive effect of concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into account.

## 3. How IXCHIQ is given

IXCHIQ is given as a single injection of 0.5 mL into the muscle of your upper arm  by a doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

The dose for adolescents aged 12 to &lt;18 years is the same as for adults.

If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

## Serious side effects

Get urgent medical attention if you get symptoms of a severe allergic reaction. Such reactions may include a combination of any of the following symptoms:

- difficulty breathing
- hoarseness or wheezing
- hives or rash
- swelling of your lips, face or throat
- dizziness
- weakness
- fast heartbeat

In the post-marketing setting, severe but rare reactions to the vaccine have been seen, especially in elderly persons (65 years or older) with multiple long-term medical conditions. These side effects included worsening of the general health or of chronic medical conditions and inflammation of the brain, leading to falls, hospitalisation or death (see section 2). Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you experience worsening of your general health or existing diseases.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The following serious side effects have been reported (frequency not known - cannot be estimated from the available data):

- Inflammation of the brain (encephalitis)
- General dysfunction of the brain, which may be caused by various factors (encephalopathy)
- Inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (meningitis)

If you experience symptoms suggestive of these side effects, such as confusion, sleepiness, fever, headache, seizures or neck stiffness, seek medical attention immediately mentioning that you have recently received IXCHIQ.

## Side effects similar to chikungunya disease

IXCHIQ may cause side effects similar to chikungunya disease (fever ≥ 38°C together with joint pain, muscle pain, headache, fatigue, or certain symptoms pertaining to the nervous system, the heart or the eyes). The symptoms usually start about 3 days after vaccination and disappear within 4 days. In some uncommon cases (about 4 in 1000 people), these side effects may last longer than 30 days.
