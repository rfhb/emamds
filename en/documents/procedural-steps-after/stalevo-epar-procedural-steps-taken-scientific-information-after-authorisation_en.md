1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update of SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8 in order to update the safety information by implementing class labelling for the risk of impulse control disorders. C.I.3.z - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under A 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Other variation | 13/12/2012 | 14/01/2013 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Based on a recent review of the available post-marketing data in relation to the risk of development of impulse control disorders when using medicinal products containing levodopa, dopamine agonists and/or catechol-O- methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors, the CHMP/PhVWP requested a class labelling to update and harmonise the product information of all products concerned. In response to this request, the product information was updated to reflect behavioural symptoms related to impulse control disorders including compulsive spending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating. It was clarified that this adverse reaction can occur irrespective of the indication and at normal doses. Furthermore, regular monitoring of patients and a careful review of treatment, if symptoms occur, is recommended. The Package Leaflet was updated in accordance and advice for the patient's family and carers was provided. |

| II/0054 | Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and relevant sections of the Package Leaflet (PL) with respect to ischemic heart disease events, myocardial infarction and irregular heart rhythm. In addition, yellow iron oxide has been deleted from section 6.1 of the SPC and section 6 of the PL for the Stalevo 75/18.75/200mg and 125/31.25/200mg strengths. Annex II has been updated to reflect a change in the PSUR cycle and other minor amendments have been introduced in the Product Information. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 21/01/2010 | 23/03/2010 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | The product information was updated to reflect that Stalevo therapy should be administered cautiously to patients with ischemic heart disease. In addition, the risk of heart attack (myocardial infarction) and the risk of heart or artery disease events other than a heart attack (e.g. chest pain) were added to the Product Information as possible side effects, classified as uncommon and common respectively. The incidence rates of myocardial infarction and other ischemic heart disease events (0.43% and 1.54%, respectively) are derived from an analysis of 13 double- blind studies involving 2082 patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations receiving entacapone. Information on cardiac arrhythmias has been added to the SPC section 4.8, subtitle Levodopa/carbidopa, and irregular heart rate or rhythm has been added to the PL with frequency common. |

The new 75/18.75/200 mg and 125/31.25/200 mg strengths compare with the already marketed Stalevo strength with carbidopa and levodopa contained in 1:4 ratio and combined with 200 mg entacapone. In the fixed combination of three active ingredients, levodopa mediates the antiparkinsonian effect whereas carbidopa and entacapone inhibit the peripheral metabolism of levodopa. The indication is the same as for the other strengths, i.e. the treatment of Parkinson (PD) patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations not stabilized with the combination of levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor. The new strengths being proposed are intermediates to the currently approved Stalevo tablets.

| II/0007   | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet                                   | 27/07/2005   | 30/08/2005 | SmPC and PL         | Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported 9 times since market introduction of entacapone. In four out of nine of these cases entacapone and other PD drug treatment has been abruptly withdrawn 1-2 days before event onset. In the remaining cases many confounding factors could be recognized, severe underlying illnesses, complex drug treatments, and co-administration of entacapone with drugs reported to have been related to NMS even on their own, and these cases create no clear signal at the moment. The wording on NMS in section 4.4 of the SPC has been revised to state that isolated cases of NMS have been reported, especially following abrupt reduction or discontinuation of entacapone and other concomitant dopaminergic medications. It was also added to section 4.8 of the SPC that isolated cases of NMS have been reported following abrupt reduction or discontinuation of entacapone and other dopaminergic medications. This change was also reflected in the Package Leaflet.Since market introduction of entacapone 9 cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Rhabdomyolysis has been mild or moderate and other possible causal factors have been detected. Consequently information has been added to section 4.8 of the SPC that isolated cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported. |
