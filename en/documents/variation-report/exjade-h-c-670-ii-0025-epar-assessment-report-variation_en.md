## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Novartis Europharm Ltd submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 8 December 2011 an application for a variation including an extension of indication.

This application concerns the following medicinal product:

| Medicinal product:   | International non-proprietary name:   | Presentations:   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------|
| Exjade               | DEFERASIROX                           | See Annex A      |

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II     |

The MAH proposed a change of indication for the treatment of infrequently transfused betathalassemia major patients in section 4.1. The MAH also proposed to update the product information in line with the latest QRD template (version 8, revision 1).

The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

Exajde was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/02/092 on 13 March 2002.

The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within the above mentioned orphan designation.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/216/2011 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/216/2011 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Protocol assistance

The MAH did not seek Protocol Assistance at the CHMP.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Beta thalassaemia (β-thalassaemia) major syndromes are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, mostly as a result of iron overload of visceral organs due to repeated blood transfusions. Iron chelation therapy, aimed to remove the excess of iron administered in blood transfusions and to reduce the existing iron burden, represents the mainstay of the treatment of these patients.

Deferoxamine is considered the the comparator reference iron chelation therapy. It is administered by subcutaneous infusion overnight 5 days a week. In consequence, it is associated with poor compliance.

Exjade (deferasirox) is an orally available iron chelator for once daily use. Exjade is indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions ( ≥ 7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older.

Exjade is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups:

- -in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions ( ≥ 7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years,
- -in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to infrequent blood transfusions (&lt;7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 years and older,
- -in patients with other anaemias aged 2 years and older.

In 2012, the indication of Exjade has also been extended for the treatment of chronic iron overload requiring chelation therapy when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes aged 10 years and older.

The initial marketing authorisation of Exjade was granted on the basis of Study ICL670C0107. The approved indication was based on the results of a subgroup analysis within this trial. The restriction to use Exjade in infrequently transfused patients when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate resulted from a failure to establish non-inferiority in the subgroup of less severely iron overloaded patients.

In this application, the MAH of Exjade proposed to change the indication by removing this restriction of indication 'when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate', thus proposing the use of deferasirox as first-line treatment in infrequently-transfused patients betathalassemia major patients aged 6 years and older. This variation application was supported by an analysis of 2,102 β-thalassemia major patients exposed to deferasirox in 6 completed clinical trials.

Further to the assessment of the CHMP and their conclusions as detailed in this report that this extension of the indication was not considered approvable, the MAH decided not to pursue the proposed change to the indication.

However, the CHMP agreed to the proposal from the MAH to include in section 4.8 of the SmPC a description of the magnitude of the effect on estimated renal clearance based on the retrospective meta-analysis.

Given  the  difference  in  exposure  in  these  6  studies,  the  MAH  supported  this  application  with analyses performed separately as follows:

- -Study ICL670A2409, consisting of 1,115 β-thalassemia patients who received deferasirox (treatment duration of one year),
- -Core Study ICL670A2402 and its extension ICl670A2402E1 (combined treatment duration of up to 3 years), consisting of 237 β-thalassemia patients who received deferasirox,
- -Pool  database  of  studies  ICL670A0105,  ICL670A0106,  ICL670A0107,  ICL670A0108  and their  extensions  (treatment  duration  of  up  to  5  years),  consisting  of  750  β-thalassemia patients who received deferasirox.

During  the  evaluation,  the  MAH  also  provided  data  from  a  pooled  analysis  of  the  six  studies ('extended  pooled  safety  set')  as  well  as  a  retrospective  analysis  of  the  data  obtained  in  the

## Study participants

Study  ICL670A0105: patients (≥ 18 years) with transfusion-dependent iron overload (Liver iron concentration (LIC): ≥ 5 to ≤ 15 mg Fe/g dw ) previously treated with deferoxamine.

Study ICL670A0107: β-thalassemia patients (≥ 2 years) with transfusional haemosiderosis (LIC: ≥ 2 mg Fe/g dw, transfusions ≥ 8 per year).

Study  ICL670A0106:  paediatric  patients  (≥  2  to  ≤  17  years)  with  transfusion  dependent  βthalassaemia  major  (LIC:  ≥  2.5  mg  Fe/g  dw  or  SF  ≥  1000  μg/L)  previously  treated  with deferoxamine (for ≥ 4 weeks).

Study ICL670A0108: Patients (≥ 2 years) with chronic anaemias and transfusional haemosiderosis unsuitable  for  treatment  with  deferoxamine.  In  this  analysis  only  patients  with  transfusional haemosiderosis due to β-thalassemia were included.

- -Patients with β-thalassemia and documented non-compliance to deferoxamine were defined as having taken &lt; 50% of the prescribed doses in the 12 months prior to study entry, with LIC ≥ 14 mg Fe/g dw.
- -Patients with β-thalassaemia inadequately chelated with deferoxamine due to contraindications  and/or  due  to  documented  unacceptable  toxicity  of  deferoxamine,  or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

documented poor response to deferoxamine despite proper compliance, with LIC ≥ 2 mg Fe/g dw.

Study ICL670A2402: patients (≥ 2 years) with transfusional haemosiderosis who were previously treated with deferiprone or deferoxamine. The patients in the study were:

- -β-thalassaemia  outpatients  with  transfusional  haemosiderosis  and  unable  to  be  chelated with deferoxamine due to deferoxamine being contra-indicated and/or due to documented unacceptable  toxicity  of  deferoxamine  or  documented  poor  response  to  deferoxamine despite proper compliance, with SF ≥ 500 μg/L and LIC ≥ 2 mg/Fe/g dw liver.
- -β-thalassaemia outpatients with transfusional haemosiderosis and documented noncompliance to deferoxamine, defined as having taken less than 50% of the prescribed chelation therapy doses in the 12 months prior to study entry
- -β-thalassemia outpatients with transfusional haemosiderosis treated with deferiprone, who discontinued deferiprone treatment at least 28 days before Day 1 of this study, and had SF ≥ 500 μg/L and LIC ≥ 2 mg/Fe/g dw.

Study ICL670A2409: patients (≥ 2 years) with transfusion-dependent iron overload who had been previously treated with chelation therapy as well as patients who had not. The patients  presented with iron overload as shown by SF ≥ 1000 μg/L at start of study or patients presenting with SF &lt;1000 μg/L but with history of multiple transfusions (&gt; 20 transfusions or 100 mL/kg of  packed red blood cells [pRBC]) and LIC &gt;2 mg Fe/g dw (as confirmed by R2-MRI).

## Treatments

- Controlled studies

Study  ICL670A0105:  randomisation  1:1:1  to  oral  deferasirox  10mg/kg/day,  oral  deferasirox 20mg/kg/day or subcutaneous infusions of deferoxamine 20 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days a week. Subsequent dose-titrations were based on change in LIC, determined every 3 months by a non-invasive method (SQUID) over 12 months.

Intermediate  extension  phase  (ICL670A0105E1):  after  completing  12  months  of  treatment consenting  patients  who  were  considered  to  be  deriving  benefit  from  treatment,  continued  to receive study therapy

Non comparative long term extension (ICL670A0105E2): patients who completed the intermediate extension phase were eligible to receive deferasirox treatment for 5 years.

Study ICL670A0107: Patients were randomised (1:1) to once-daily oral doses of deferasirox 5 to 40 mg/kg/day for 7 days/week or subcutaneous infusions of deferoxamine 20 to 60 mg/kg/day for 5  consecutive  days/week.  After  randomisation  to  deferasirox  or  deferoxamine  patients  were assigned to different dose cohorts (5, 10, 20 or 30 mg/kg) by the Investigator according to their baseline LIC values, with doses fixed during the first year and subsequent dose titration based on safety and efficacy.

Extension study (ICL670A0107E1) enrolled patients who had completed the core study, and was designed primarily to evaluate the long term efficacy and safety of deferasirox in β- thalassemia patients with transfusional haemosiderosis treated for 4 years. In the extension study, all patients received treatment with deferasirox, regardless of their treatment assignment in the core study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Uncontrolled studies

Study ICL670A0106: patients were treated with repeated doses of deferasirox 10 mg/kg/day with subsequent dose titration based on change in LIC. SQUID was performed 4 weeks after start of treatment, and then every 12 weeks up to 48 weeks.

Patients  who  had  completed  1-year  of  study  treatment  and  scheduled  assessments  in  the  core study were enrolled into the extension phase ICL670A0106E1, to evaluate the long term safety of deferasirox in paediatric patients with β-thalassemia treated for 5 years

Study ICL670A0108: Once daily oral doses of deferasirox between 5 to 40 mg/kg based on their baseline LIC for one year and subsequent dose-titration was based on safety and efficacy. Patients with LIC of 2 to 3 mg Fe/g dw received deferasirox 5 mg/kg, with LIC of &gt; 3 to 7 mg Fe/g dw received 10 mg/kg, with LIC of &gt; 7 to 14 mg Fe/g dw received 20 mg/kg, and with LIC of &gt; 14 mg Fe/g dw received 30 mg/kg.

Patients who completed at least one year of treatment in the core phase were enrolled in to the 4year extension phase (ICL670A0108E), to evaluate the long term safety and tolerability profile of deferasirox.

Study ICL670A2402: Fixed starting once-daily dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg/day based on baseline LIC, with subsequent dose adjustments based on SF levels.

Patients who completed at least one year of treatment in the core phase were enrolled into the 2year extension phase (ICL670A2402E1), to evaluate the long term safety and tolerability profile of deferasirox.

Study ICL670A2409: initial recommended daily dose of deferasirox was 20 mg/kg/day body weight for patients who had received blood transfusions with a frequency of about 2 to 4 units/month of pRBC  (7to  14  mL  pRBCs/kg/month).  An  initial  daily  dose  of  30  mg/kg/day  was  considered  for patients receiving more frequent blood transfusions and 10 mg/kg/day for patients receiving less frequent  transfusions  or  for  patients  receiving  exchange  transfusions.  Subsequent  doses  were titrated based on the combined evaluation of efficacy and safety parameters.

## Objectives

Key objectives are described in Table 1.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Key endpoints are described in Table 1. Blood intake was expressed as pRBC volume per kilogram body weight per month (mL/kg/month) and the blood intake groups (blood intake derived from one year  of  treatment)  were  categorised  following  the  definition  used  in  the  current  SPC  for deferasirox:

- -Infrequently transfused patients: &lt; 7 mL pRBCs/kg/month
- -Frequently transfused patients: 7 to 14 and &gt; 14 mL pRBCs/kg/month
- -The formula used to calculate the average blood intake in mL/kg/month was: (total sum of blood transfused by weight) / (corrected transfusion exposure / month), where:
- -Total  sum  of  blood  transfused  by  weight  (mL/kg)  is  the  sum  of  [(amount  of  blood transfused  [mL])  ×  haematocrit  (%)  /  100]  /  (body  weight  (kg)  at  transfusion).  If  the transfusion  record's  haematocrit  value  was  missing,  it  was  imputed  by  the  haematocrit value  provided  by  the  respective  centre.  If  the  amount  of  blood  transfused  was  not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

expressed in mL (or cm3), it was first converted to mL. For units expressed in 'pack', 'unit' or 'bag', it was assumed that one pack/unit/bag was 200 mg iron, i.e. 185 mL of RBC.

- -Corrected transfusion exposure was the normal exposure plus a correction factor, i.e. (last transfusion date - first transfusion date + 1) + ([last transfusion date - first transfusion date + 1] / [number of transfusion records - 1]).

The efficacy of deferasirox was also assessed by groups of age at first dose (2 to &lt;6, 6 to &lt;12, 12 to &lt;18, and ≥ 18 years) and average dose (&lt;7.5, 7.5 to 12.5, &gt;12.5 to 17.5, &gt;17.5 to &lt;25, 25 to &lt;35, and ≥ 35 mg/kg/day). These dose groups correspond to deferasirox doses used in clinical practice (5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively).

The efficacy characterization was based on changes after 1 year of treatment with deferasirox in:

- -Serum Ferritin (SF)
- -Liver Iron Concentration (LIC)
- -Iron Excretion (IE)

In addition, long term efficacy, up to 5 years of treatment, was assessed. In order to account for the exposure differences across the 3 datasets, data were provided by yearly periods of treatment (a year was defined as 365 days).

## Sample size

Not applicable.

## Randomisation

In studies ICL670A0105 and ICL670A0105, patients were randomised to oral deferasirox or subcutaneous infusion of deferoxamine. ICL670A0105 was a three arm study, as two doses of deferasirox (10 or 20 mg/kg/day) were tested, while in ICL670A0107 a range of dose (5-40 mg/kg/day) was allowed in the deferasirox arm.

## Blinding (masking)

Not applicable.

## Statistical methods

The efficacy parameters were analysed using the following analysis sets:

- -Safety  Analysis  Set  (SAS)  comprised  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of deferasirox and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment.
- -Full Analysis Set (FAS) comprised all patients who successfully passed screening and had been selected to start study medication in the context of the respective protocol.

The  FAS,  which  required  that  patients  be  randomised  or  assigned  to  a  treatment,  but  not necessarily treated, was used for studies ICL670A2409 and ICL670A2402. For the Pool, the SAS was used; this database had been previously created to perform safety analysis of deferasirox and all patients included were treated with deferasirox. Thus, efficacy and safety analyses in this report are based on the SAS for the Pool dataset.

## Ancillary analyses

Comparisons of efficacy and safety between DFX and DFO by blood intake categories were performed within  study  A0107.  In  this  study,  infrequently  transfused  patients  were  comparable  to  frequently transfused patients in terms of age and race. The proportion of female patients and the baseline SF values tended to be higher in infrequently transfused patients. Results are summarised in Table 10 and Figures 5-6.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The  aim  of  this  application  was  to  demonstrate  efficacy  (and  safety)  of  deferasirox  in  infrequently transfused beta-thalassemia patients in first line therapy. To do so, the MAH did not conduct a new randomised study to compare deferasirox with the standard of care deferoxamine in the infrequently-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

transfused  population.  The  MAH  supported  this  objective  by  comparing  the  activity  of  deferasirox between infrequently-transfused and frequently-transfused patients.

The MAH presented a descriptive analysis of pooled individual data from 6 deferasirox studies (phase II to phase IV) without an active comparator. This descriptive analysis was performed by subgroup.

Studies  were  heterogeneous,  especially  in  terms  of  intervention  and  consequently  results  were presented separately in 3 main datasets. However, presentation in three separate datasets in order to account for the heterogeneity was considered insufficient.

Specification of starting dose based on transfusion requirements was implemented only after the first studies. Furthermore, schedule of dose titration was different across studies, whereby deferasirox dose was maintained constant for the first year of treatment in some studies, whereas in other studies dosetitration was possible, based on efficacy markers. Additionally, dose titration (during the first year of treatment  and  after)  was  not  standardised  across  the  trials.  These  discrepancies  may  affect  the comparability of the intervention among the samples and consequently affect robustness of efficacy conclusions that might be drawn from the datasets.

The  additional  pooled  analysis  of  the  six  studies  provided  by  the  MAH  presented  several  major methodological weaknesses which impacted the reliability of its results (clinical heterogeneity of the studies, retrospective categorisation of the patients with potential biases in this allocation and potential non comparability of the groups).

Similarly, the retrospective analysis of the data obtained in the pivotal study A 0107 presented several major methodological weaknesses (retrospective allocation of the patients in subgroups, no statistical testing  strategy,  small  sample  size  of  the  subgroups  especially  for  infrequently  transfused  patients) and therefore cannot be considered as a reliable comparison of the efficacy of DFX versus DFO.

Contradictory results were observed in the different datasets, which could be related to the different criteria to modify the dose (LIC or serum ferritin variations) in each single study and further underlines the heterogeneity of the examined trials and the difficulty to draw any incontrovertible conclusion of efficacy. Consequently, the Pool overall change is hardly interpretable.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The submitted analyses do not provide sufficient level of evidence to establish that the clinical efficacy of deferasirox in infrequently transfused patients with β-thalassemia major is non-inferior to deferoxamine.

Further to the assessment of the CHMP and their conclusions as detailed in this report that this extension of the indication was not considered approvable, the MAH decided not to pursue with the proposed change to the indication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.5. Clinical safety

The  safety  evaluation  was  based  on  analysis  of  2,102  β-thalassaemia  major  patients  exposed  to deferasirox  (mean  daily  dose  22.4-25.7  mg/kg/day)  in  6  completed  trials.  Five  of  these  studies consisted of a core phase and an extension phase (with treatment durations of up to 5 years) aimed to assess long term safety. Two of these studies involved the use of the active comparator deferoxamine as  a  control.  This  analysis  allowed  a  quantitative  characterisation  of  the  safety  of  deferasirox  in patients  with  infrequent  blood  transfusions  (&lt;7  mL  pRBCs/kg/month)  in  comparison  with  frequently transfused patients (≥ 7 mL pRBCs/kg/month).

The safety population comprised all patients from the 6 clinical studies who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment.

Due to the differences in exposure in the 6 studies included in this analysis, the studies were grouped into 3 datasets:

- -Study ICL670A2409 (treatment duration of one year)
- -Pooled database consisting of studies ICL670A0105, ICL670A0106, ICL670A0107, ICL670A0108 and their extensions (treatment duration up to 5 years)
- -Study ICL670A2402/E consisting of the core study and its extension ICl670A2402E (treatment duration up to 3 years)

Since the key objective of the safety analysis was to compare the safety of deferasirox by blood intake, patients were categorised into 3 blood intake groups as follows:

- -Infrequently transfused patients: &lt;7 mL pRBCs/kg/month
- -Frequently transfused patients: 7-14 mL pRBCs/kg/month and &gt;14 mL pRBCs/kg/month

The safety of deferasirox was also assessed by age at first dose and dose.

## Patient exposure

This analysis includes exposure of 4,326 patient-years (528 patient-years of exposure for infrequently transfused  patients  and  3,785  patient-years  of  exposure  for  patients  receiving  more  frequent transfusions) including 2,433 patients-years of exposure in paediatric patients.

Globally, patients in Study ICL670A2402 were younger compared to patients in Study ICL670A2409 and in the Pool (median age of 12, 17 and 18 years, respectively). Overall, approximately 45% of the patients were ≥ 18 years old (adults), 24% were 12 to &lt;18 years old (adolescents), 20% were 6 to &lt;12 years old (older children), and 10% were &lt;6 years old (young children).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Across the 3 datasets, patients in the low blood intake category were older (median age: 21, 22, and 20 years in Study ICL670A2409, the Pool, and Study ICL670A2402, respectively) compared to patients with moderate (median age: 15, 18, and 12 years, respectively) and high blood intake (median age: 15, 11, and 8 years, respectively).

Frequency is the number of patients with AE onset within the given year. N is the number of patients receiving deferasirox at the start of the given year. A patient with multiple occurrences of an AE is counted only once in that AE category.

PTs are presented in descending order of frequency according to thePool Y1 All column. Blood intake categories:&lt;7 mL pRBCs/kg/month (low blood intake), 7 to 14 mL pRBCs/kg/month(moderate blood intake),and&gt;14mL pRBCs/kg/month(highblood intake).

## · AEs in subsequent years of treatment

According to the MAH, in the Pool in years 2 to 5 and in Study ICL670A2402/E in years 2 and 3, the overall  AE  incidence  and  the  incidence  of  most  individuals  PTs  in  infrequently  transfused  patients tended  to  be  slightly  lower  than  in  the  overall  patient  population.  However,  the  number  of  AEs  for individual PTs in infrequently transfused patients was too small to make firm conclusions.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## · Deaths

A total of 16 deaths on study or within 28 days of study drug discontinuation were reported in the 3 datasets and have previously been reported in the individual study reports.

None of the deaths were suspected to be related to deferasirox treatment. Two deaths occurred in 307 infrequently transfused patients (0.64%) and 14 deaths occurred in 1758 patients (0.79%) who were more frequently transfused.

PTs are presented in descending order of frequency according to the Pool Y2 All column. Only the &lt;7 mL/kg/month blood intake category is presented here. Frequency is the number of patients with AE onset within the given year. Nis the number of patients receiving deferasirox at the start of the given year. A patient with multiple occurrences of an AE is counted only once in that AE category.

## · AEs of special interest

Group term AEs for rash, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea were the most frequently reported in all datasets. Most of these AEs were mild to moderate in severity, rarely reported as SAEs, and infrequently resulted in study drug discontinuation.

No clear pattern in the frequencies of AEs of special interest by blood intake groups could be delineated across  the  3  datasets.  In  the  2409  and  2402/E  datasets,  rash  was  more  frequently  reported  in frequently transfused patients. However, in the Pool dataset, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and abnormal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

blood  creatinine  were  more  commonly  reported  in  infrequently  transfused  patients.  No  cases  of Fanconi  syndrome  or  hearing  loss  were  reported  in  infrequently  transfused  patients.  Across  all  3 datasets,  only  one  patient,  in  the  moderate  blood  intake  category,  presented  with  a  liver  function impairment group term AE. All other AEs of special interest were of similar frequencies by blood intake groups.

row

In  subsequent  years  of  treatment,  diarrhoea  and  abnormal  blood  creatinine  were  more  common  in frequently  transfused  patients  than  in  those  infrequently  transfused  in  Years  2  to  4,  with  similar frequencies for these AESIs between blood intake groups in Year 5. Abdominal pain was more common in frequently transfused patients than in infrequently transfused patients in Year 2; however, this trend was reversed in  Year  3,  with  a  similar  frequency  of  this  AE  of  special  interest  between  both  blood intake groups in Years 4 and Year 5. All other AEs of special interest were similar in incidence between blood intake groups throughout all time points.

A patient with multiple occurrences of an AE is counted only once in that AE category.

## Post marketing experience

## · Post-marketing experience

Deferasirox is commercially available within the United States, European Union, Switzerland, and other markets worldwide for the treatment of transfusional iron overload.

Safety data from all sources (literature, studies, spontaneous reporting) are reviewed on an ongoing basis for any impact on the EU SPC and local labelling.

The total cumulative patient exposure since the International Birth Date of 02-Nov-2005 up to 31-Oct2010  was  89,168  patient-treatment-years. The total cumulative exposure in  MAH  sponsored investigational  clinical  trials  (excluding  PMS  studies,  third  party  study  studies  and  registries)  as  of 31-Oct-2010 was 6,922 patients.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

As discussed with respect to efficacy results, the studies included in these analyses are heterogeneous. The proposed meta-analysis compared 2 populations with very different size which is a limitation of the proposed approach especially for safety. Infrequently transfused patients constitute a relatively small fraction of the subjects (15%). Data available for infrequently transfused paediatric patients was also too scarce to draw any firm conclusion on the safety in this subpopulation.

Therefore, due to heterogeneity of studies, results of this meta-analysis should be taken with caution and no firm conclusions can be drawn, particularly when looking at the data in subgroups by age.

Concerning the currently approved restricted indication, overall no new signal emerged from these studies. The overall adverse event profile was consistent with the known safety profile of Exjade and complications of underlying conditions. Despite the methodological pitfalls, the meta-analysis provided the best available estimate of the effect of Exjade on creatinine clearance relevant for the currently approved restricted indication. As this has been previously missing from the SmPC, a description of the magnitude of the effect on estimated renal clearance has been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety data available based on the retrospective meta-analysis for infrequently transfused patients are not sufficient to draw any firm conclusion on the safety of deferasirox outside the currently approved restricted indication ('when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate'). Further to the assessment of the CHMP and their conclusions as detailed in this report that this extension of the indication was not considered approvable, the MAH decided not to pursue with the proposed change to the indication.

Concerning the currently approved restricted indication, the CHMP included a description of the magnitude of the effect on estimated renal clearance in section 4.8 of the SmPC based on the retrospective meta-analysis.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The Annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

No updates to the current version of the risk management plan are necessary.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

Further to data submitted in this application, the following information was added to the summary of the safety profile in section 4.8 of the SmPC:

'In a retrospective meta-analysis of 2,102 adult and paediatric beta-thalassaemia patients with transfusional iron overload (including patients with different characteristics such as transfusion intensity, posology and treatment duration) treated in two randomised clinical trials and four open label studies of up to five years' duration, a mean creatinine clearance decrease of 13.2% in adult patients (95%CI: -14.4% to -12.1%; n=935) and 9.9% (95%CI: -11.1% to -8.6%; n=1142) in paediatric patients was observed during the first year of treatment. In a subset of patients followed for more than one year (n=250 up to five years), no further decrease in mean creatinine clearance levels was observed in subsequent years.'

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template (version 8.3), which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Exjade is an efficient oral iron chelator. An iron chelating agent permits to achieve safe levels of body iron. This is a slow process because only a small proportion of body iron is available for chelation at any moment.

The purpose of this submission was the extension of indication of deferasirox to first line use in infrequently transfused beta-thalassemia patients aged 6 years or older. Current standard therapy in this indication is subcutaneous deferoxamine.

The MAH submitted pooled analysis of six studies in infrequently transfused patients as well as a retrospective analysis of the data obtained in the pivotal study A 0107 providing comparative results of DFX versus DFO in order to demonstrate efficacy and safety of deferasirox in this population. Efficacy was assessed by mean changes in serum ferritin levels, liver iron concentration (LIC) and iron excretion (IE). Overall, the data submitted had many limitations and no conclusions could be drawn based on these results.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The benefits of deferasirox as first-line treatment in infrequently-transfused patients beta outside the currently approved restricted indication ('when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate') have not been established.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

No new signal emerged from these analyses: The overall adverse event profile was consistent with the known safety profile of Exjade and complications of underlying conditions.

Nephrotoxicity is a known safety concern with Exjade. The main related event observed more frequently in infrequently transfused patient was blood creatinine increased in the 1st year of treatment in 2 datasets. In a subset of patients followed for more than one year (n=250 up to five years), no further decrease in mean creatinine clearance levels was observed in subsequent years.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The data available for infrequently transfused paediatric were insufficient to draw any firm conclusion on the safety of deferasirox as first-line treatment in infrequently-transfused patients beta outside the currently approved restricted indication ('when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate').

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects and benefit-risk balance

Non-comparative results from the pooled analysis are difficult to interpret and are not sufficiently robust to draw conclusions. Retrospective analysis from the study A0107 also presented major methodological weaknesses which cannot allow to conclude on the efficacy profile of deferasirox versus deferoxamine in infrequently-transfused patients.

No new signal emerged from these analyses. However, in view of the lack of representativeness of the dataset, adverse events of interest and safety concern may not have occurred or be underestimated in the proposed analysis particularly the know concern of nephrotoxicity which requires close monitoring.

In the absence of established favourable and unfavourable effects, the benefit-risk balance of deferasirox as first-line treatment in infrequently-transfused patients beta outside the currently approved restricted indication ('when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate') cannot be considered as positive.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

The CHMP agreed to include in section 4.8 of the SmPC a description of the magnitude of the effect on estimated renal clearance based on the retrospective meta-analysis.

## 4. Recommendations

Further to the assessment of the CHMP and their conclusions as detailed in this report that this extension of the indication was not considered approvable, the MAH decided not to pursue with the proposed change to the indication.

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following changes:
