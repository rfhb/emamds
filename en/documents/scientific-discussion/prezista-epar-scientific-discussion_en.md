## 1. Introduction

As of the end of 2004, an estimated 39.4 million people worldwide - 37.2 million adults and 2.2 children younger than 15 years - were living with Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

Current treatment options consist of four different mechanistic classes of compounds:

- -NRTIs (nucleoside/nucleotide  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors)  inhibiting  the reverse transcriptase (RT) of HIV by structural similarity with the substrate of RT.
- -NNRTIs  (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) inhibiting the reverse transcriptase of HIV without being nucleosides analogues.
- -PIs  (protease  inhibitors)  inhibiting  the  HIV  protease  which  is  an  enzyme required for the assembly and release of mature HIV particles from the cell after the replication cycle.
- -Entry inhibitors: there is currently only one compound authorised which is a fusion inhibitor, (inhibits fusion of the HIV with CD4+ cells, hence infection of cells).

Regimens  containing  one  or  more  of  these  agents  are  required  for  building  combination antiretroviral therapies. The choice of the combination regimens depends on several factors such as the status of the patient, particularly in terms of plasma viral load (HIV RNA), CD4 cell counts, previous treatment(s), prior relapse and intolerance to treatment. The long-term use of all these products is, however, hampered by different factors such by the emergence of resistance,  by  potential  toxicity  and  in  some  cases  by  inconvenient  dosing  schedules  or formulations.  Further  therapeutic  agents  are  therefore  needed,  particularly  in  patients  who have failed their therapy and who have no or few remaining treatment options.

PREZISTA, which contains  darunavir,  a  protease  inhibitor,  has  been  developed  for  highly treatment-experienced patients who have failed more than one PI regimen.

A so-called  full  application  has  been  submitted  for  registration.  PREZISTA  is  available  as 300 mg film-coated tablets.

The recommended dose is 600 mg to be co-administered with low dose of ritonavir (100 mg as pharmacokinetic enhancer) twice daily.

The approved indication is: PREZISTA, co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir in combination  with  other  antiretroviral medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  human immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV-1)  infection  in  highly  pre-treated  adult  patients  who  failed more than one regimen containing a protease inhibitor (PI).

This indication is based on week-24 analyses of virological and immunological response from 2 controlled dose range finding Phase II trials and additional data from uncontrolled studies (see section 5.1).

In  deciding  to  initiate  treatment  with  PREZISTA  co-administered  with  100 mg  ritonavir careful consideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of mutations associated with different agents. Genotypic or phenotypic testing (when available) and treatment history should guide the use of PREZISTA'.

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. Quality aspects

## Introduction

PREZISTA is presented as film-coated tablets containing 300 mg of darunavir (as ethanolate). The other ingredients include microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal anhydrous silica, crospovidone,  magnesium  stearate,  poly(vinyl  alcohol)  -  partially  hydrolysed,  macrogol 3350, titanium dioxide (E171), talc and sunset yellow FCF (E110).

The tablets are packed in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles closed with polypropylene (PP) child resistant closures.

## Drug Substance

Darunavir is a white to off-white hygroscopic powder. Its solubility in organic solvents varies significantly  and  it  is  very  slightly  soluble  in  aqueous  solution  (solubility  increases  with decreasing pH). Therefore, the particle size is likely to be important to the rate and possibly to the extent of absorption of darunavir.

It contains 5 chiral centres, however the manufacturing process leads, in a consistent way, to the single enantiomer 3 R , 3a S , 6a R , 1 S , 2 R . The absolute configuration has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis.

Under commercial synthesis conditions, darunavir is isolated as a crystalline ethanolate (1:1 solvate).

It can exist as a non-solvated amorphous form and as a hydrate form as well. Investigations of conditions under which inter-conversion between the different polymorphs occur showed that the  hydrate  form  can  be  formed  under  conditions  of  high  relative  humidity  and  that  both solvates can be converted into the amorphous form when subject to heat and/or extremely low relative humidity.

Detailed information on quality/control of materials used in the synthesis, as well as on the synthesis itself, has been provided by the way of an active substance master file (ASMF).

## · Manufacture

Darunavir is synthesised at two different sites from two starting materials in a 3-step synthesis followed by crystallisation in ethanol.

Satisfactory  specification  and  associated  methods  have  been  provided  for  the  starting materials, key intermediate, reagents and solvents in the restricted part of the ASMF.

The stereo-isomeric purity of the active is ensured by using starting materials of high stereoisomeric purity and by controlling the enantiomeric purity of critical intermediates. Moreover, the  configuration  of  the  3 R ,  3a S ,  6a R ,  1 S ,  2 R enantiomer  is  energically  favourable,  no stereogenic  centre  is  formed  during  manufacture  and  absence  of  interconversion  during synthesis and storage has been demonstrated.

Process  impurities  originating  from  each  starting  material/reagent/solvent  and  during  the synthesis have been adequately discussed. No degradation products have been detected during stability studies.

Validation  data  provided  for  3  consecutive  full-scale  batches  confirm  robustness  and reproducibility of the process.

## · Specification

The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  controlled  by  validated  methods  for appearance, identity (IR and HPLC), assay (HPLC), impurity content (HPLC), ethanol (GC), residual solvents (GC), residue on ignition, water content, heavy metals and particle size. The formation of the desired enantiomer is ensured by controlling the enantiomeric purity of the starting materials and of the intermediates (see above). Therefore, the omission of a chiral

2/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

assay  for  the  claimed  enantiomer  and  a  chiral  purity  test  in  the  specification  has  been supported in this particular case.

Darunavir particle size specification is within the particle size range of tablets used in clinical trials and found to be bioequivalent (see drug product).

Impurity limits in the specification are justified by toxicology studies.

Batch analysis data provided for the nine production-scale batches, including the 3 validation batches, confirm satisfactory compliance and uniformity with the proposed specification.

## · Stability

Under  accelerated  conditions  (40°C/75%  RH  -  commercial  packaging)  and  long-term conditions (25°C/60% RH - commercial packaging), respectively 6-month data and up 1-year data have been provided for three batches manufactured using the commercial synthesis.

The  parameters  tested  included  appearance,  assay,  purity,  stereo-isomeric  purity,  ethanol, water content and microbial purity

The proposed retest period is supported by the presented data when darunavir is stored in the proposed packaging.

## Drug Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The objective of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain an immediate-release solid oral dosage form, the poor water-solubility, the polymorphism and the physical characteristics of darunavir being the critical parameters to take into account.

After a 20 mg/ml oral solution (TF019), numerous solid oral dosage forms were developed and used in clinical studies:

- -several  capsule  formulations  (TF038,  TF042,  TF043,  and  TF044  -  TF051  and TF052),
- -a powder for oral suspension (TF041),
- -several  direct  compression  tablet  formulations  (TF036,  F001,  F002,  and  F012, F014, F016).

The tablet formulations showed a lower bioavailability compared to the capsule formulations. However,  the  tablet was  selected for further development  due  to the possibility of incorporating a high drug load, a favourable stability profile/storage conditions and convenience for the patient.

The excipients have been selected based on their compatibility with darunavir: sodium lauryl sulphate initially included as a surfactant (400 mg tablet (TF036, F001) and proportional 200 mg  tablet  (F002))  was  removed  from  subsequent  formulations  (400  mg  film-coated  tablet (F012 and F014) and proportional 300 mg film-coated (F016 commercial formulation)) as it yielded to a new degradation product. In addition, crospovidone was introduced in the latest formulations  to  improve  manufacturability  during  the  compression  process  and  the  tablets were  film-coated  to  aid  taste  masking,  product  identification  and  in  order  to  reduce  tablet friability.

All  the  excipients  are  of  PhEur  quality  except  the  spray-dried  mixture  of  microcrystalline cellulose  and  colloidal  silicon  dioxide  and  the  film-coating.  However,  they  are  controlled according to acceptable standards. With regards to the TSE risk, PREZISTA does not contain any component of animal/human origin.

Given  the  limited  solubility  of  darunavir  and  the  finished  product  manufacturing  method (direct compression with ~52 % of active), adequate control of darunavir particle size is of importance. An acceptable specification has been established based darunavir particle size of

3/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tablets  used  in  clinical  trials  and  that  were  shown  to  have  comparable  bioavailability  in bioequivalence studies (study TMC114-C154 and study TMC114-C156).

With regards to polymorph conversion, it has been shown that the manufacturing process/storage does not have a significant impact on ethanolate/hydrate conversion. Moreover, the bioavailability of tablets containing varying amounts of darunavir ethanolate/darunavir  hydrate  was  determined  to  be  within  the  range  of  bioequivalence (TMC114-C148).

Satisfactory specification has been provided for the HDPE bottles and the polypropylene cap lined  with  foil  induction  seal.  The  suitability  of  the  primary  packaging  selected  has  been confirmed by stability studies.

Different  formulations  have  been  used  in  clinical  studies  (see  above).  In  general  relative bioavailability  studies  showed  that  the  oral  solution  (TF019)  and  the  clinical  trial  tablet formulations (e.g. TF036) meet criteria for bioequivalence under relevant clinical conditions (study TMC114-C118). However, the final tablet commercial formulation (F016) is about 20 %  more  bioavailable  than  the  clinical  trial  tablets  formulations  (e.g.  F001,  F002)  (study TMC114- C166) (see clinical sections).

## · Manufacture of the Product

The manufacturing process includes the following steps: dry blend, direct compression, filmcoating and packaging.

Satisfactory in-process controls have been defined. The effect of the manufacturing process on the potential for ethanolate/hydrate conversion has been established.

## · Product Specification

The  product  specification  includes  tests  controlled  by  validated  methods  for  appearance, identity  (HPLC  and  IR),  identification  of  colorants,  assay  (HPLC),  degradation  products (HPLC), dissolution, uniformity of dosage units (PhEur) and microbial purity (PhEur).

The  dissolution  method  has  shown  to  be  discriminatory  towards  important  aspects  of  the formulation i.e. active substance particle size and finished product formulations differences. ). Solvate conversion during manufacture has been investigated.

Batch  analysis  data  provided  for  3  batches  manufactured  at  the  commercial  manufacturing site comply with the specifications and indicate consistent and reproducible manufacture.

## · Stability of the Product

Stability  data  have  been  provided  for  the  3  batches  manufactured  at  the  commercial manufacturing site.

Under  accelerated  conditions  (40°C/75%  RH-  intended  packaging)  and  under  long-term conditions (25°C/60% RH and 30°C/70% RH - intended packaging), 6-month data and 1-year data have been provided

The parameters tested included: appearance, assay, purity, stereo isomeric purity, dissolution, microbial purity, ethanol content and water content.

The observed changes were small, and not likely to have a significant effect on efficacy and safety of the product when used according to the directions in the SPC.

The data  provided  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  and  storage  conditions  as  defined  in  the SPC.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The active substance is well characterised and documented. The pharmaceutical form selected is  adequate  taking  into  account  the  properties  and  the  stability  of  the  drug  substance.  The excipients are commonly used for this kind of formulation and the packaging material is well documented.  The  manufacturing  process  enhances  to  obtain  reproducible  finished  product batches.  Stability  tests  under  ICH  conditions  indicate  that  the  product  is  stable  for  the proposed shelf life. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the benefit-risk- balance of the product. The applicant committed to resolve it as follow up measure after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe.

## 3. Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Darunavir is a new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor (PI). Early nonclinical  development  investigated  the  safety  of  darunavir  as  a  single  agent.  However,  early clinical trials showed that systemic exposure to darunavir was enhanced by co-administration with the CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir (RTV), and therefore the non-clinical safety programme also includes bridging studies with the combination.

All  pivotal  non-clinical  studies  were  claimed  to  have  been  conducted  in  accordance  with principles of Good Laboratory Practices (GLP).

## Pharmacology

## · Primary pharmacodynamics ( in vitro/in vivo )

Darunavir as a protease inhibitor inhibits the cleavage of HIV encoded gag-pol polyproteins in virus infected cells, thereby preventing the formation of mature and infectious new virions. It was selected for its potency against wild type HIV-1 and HIV strains resistant to currently approved PIs.

## HIV-1 protease inhibition steady state kinetics.

The  inhibitory  constant  ( K i ) for  darunavir  was  &lt;0.09  nM,  in  comparison  to  &lt;0.10  nM  for lopinavir, and higher for the other PI's (ranging from 0.09 to 0.24 nM). Mutants harbouring the  V82A  or  the  I84V  mutation  were  also  tested,  for  the  V82A,  the  increase  in K i for darunavir (1.3-fold) was lower than the published increases for all the other PI's (from 1.7 to 11.2-fold).  For  the  I84V  PR,  the  increase  in K i for  darunavir  (3.2-fold)  was  lower  than  the published  data  for  ritonavir,  nelfinavir,  and  saquinavir  (11.2-fold,  3.5-fold,  and  10.7-fold, respectively).

## Inhibition of the activity of human proteases by darunavir

There were no significant inhibitory activities of darunavir (i.e. inhibition ≥ 50%) with any of the human cellular proteases (pepsin, renin, and human cathepsin D and E).

## Thermodynamics of darunavir-HIV-1 protease interaction

Darunavir binds tightly to HIV-1 protease to form highly stable complex with both wild type and mutant proteases.

- Secondary pharmacodynamics

6/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No separate secondary pharmacodynamic studies were performed.

## · Safety pharmacology

In vitro , hERG current was not inhibited (up to 10 µM, which is similar to 10-fold the human free maximum plasma level) and the cardiac action potential (sheep isolated cardiac Purkinje fibres) remained unaffected after 10 µM darunavir.

In  conscious  telemetered  beagle  dogs,  darunavir  (120  mg/kg;  oral)  did  not  affect  cardiohaemodynamic and ECG parameters (at comparable Cmax and little lower AUC values).

At oral dose up to 2000 mg/kg in rats, darunavir did not show any effect on gastrointestinal transit time, neurobehavioral and motor activity, or respiration.

Plasma levels were not measured in these studies but data obtained in toxicity studies in dogs and rats at the same doses showed that Cmax was higher in dogs but similar in rats compared to values in human following therapeutic doses, and AUC was lower in both species. Although the safety pharmacology studies did not indicate any potential hazard with darunavir, there is no safety margin.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Combinations with current antiretrovirals were studied in an anti-HIV-1/IIIB MT4 cell-based assay.  The  data  indicate  additivity  with  all  nucleoside/nucleotide  reverse  transcriptase inhibitors,  all  tested  non-nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors.  A  modest synergistic effect  with  amprenavir,  nelfinavir  and  ritonavir  was  observed  whereas  additive  effect  was described for the combination with atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir and with the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide.

## Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of darunavir has been evaluated in vitro and in several species (mice, rats, dogs and rabbits), that were also used in the non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology studies.  The  effect  of  ritonavir,  as  a  pharmacokinetic  enhancer  for  darunavir,  was  also investigated  in  several  studies.  The  methods  of  analysis  used  to  assay  darunavir  were adequate and validated. No interference between the analysis of darunavir and ritonavir was observed.

## · Absorption- Bioavailability

Following oral administration, darunavir was rapidly absorbed in all animal species (Tmax 0.56  h).  Elimination  half-life  was  also  rapid  with  half-lives  generally  less  than  5h.  Oral bioavailability of darunavir ranged from 37 to 58% in rats and 60 to 122% in dogs.

The exposure in animal species was low compared to exposure in humans. Several attempts were made  to increase darunavir exposure for instance by testing other routes of administration.

In mice, AUC values increased more than dose-proportionally up to 450 mg/kg/day and less than dose-proportionally at higher dose levels. Repeated oral dosing resulted in a decrease in AUC (by up to 3-fold at high dose levels), likely due to induction of liver enzymes involved in the metabolism of darunavir.

In  rats,  Cmax  and  AUC  values,  after  repeated  administration,  increased  more  than  doseproportionally up to 100 mg/kg/day and less than dose-proportionally at higher dose levels. As  in  mice,  repeated  oral  administration  resulted  in  a  decrease  in  systemic  exposure  to darunavir (by up to 2.5-fold at high dose levels). No consistent differences in plasma kinetics were observed between males and females.

In Beagle dogs, systemic exposure increased dose-proportionally up to 80 mg/kg but above this dose level, no further increase was observed.

Ritonavir increased AUC of darunavir by up to 15-fold in rabbits, 4-fold in rats and 2-fold in mice as well as maintained exposure on repeating dosing. No effect of RTV was observed in dogs.  Ritonavir  had  only  limited  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  darunavir  in  animals (mice,  rats,  and  dogs),  whereas  a  14-fold  increase  in  systemic  exposure  was  observed  in human  when  a  single  dose  of  600  mg  darunavir  was  administered  with  100  mg  ritonavir compared to darunavir alone.

Darunavir exposure (plasma, brain, and liver concentration) was much higher in juvenile rats (aged 12 or 26 days) probably due to incomplete maturation of the blood-brain barrier and liver enzymes involved in the elimination of darunavir. It was nonetheless lower on day 26 than on day 12, presumably reflecting the development of drug metabolising enzymes and the blood-brain barrier.

## · Distribution

In  adult  rats,  the  tissue  distribution  of 14 C-darunavir  was  extensive  and  rapid.  The  highest concentrations  of  radioactivity  were  measured  in  the  liver  and  adrenal  gland.  No  undue retention or accumulation was observed, except in melanin-rich tissues such as the pigmented parts of the eye although binding was reversible.

Co-administration of ritonavir with darunavir had little effect on tissue distribution although it reduced exposure of pigmented tissues and exposure was lower in pregnant female rats.

Darunavir crossed the placenta in pregnant rats, with levels of radioactivity found in foetuses being about 20% of that in maternal blood and is secreted in rat milk.

The plasma protein binding was moderate to high in all tested species and was concentration dependent. At 0.5 μ g/ml, plasma protein binding ranged from 63 % in rabbits to 95 % in rats. In human the plasma protein binding was relative constant ( ∼ 94%) up to a concentration of 4.7 μ g/ml, whereas about 75% was bound at 18.8 μ g/ml.

## · Metabolism ( in vitro/in vivo )

Darunavir  is  metabolised  by  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  biotransformation  mechanisms.  A  large number  of  metabolites  were  detected in  vitro using  animal  and  human  hepatocytes  and microsomal preparations. The metabolic pathway was qualitatively similar in rats, dogs and humans. The most prevalent pathway was the Phase I biotransformation including carbamate hydrolysis, aliphatic hydroxylation at the isobutyl moiety and aromatic hydroxylation at the aniline  moiety.  Dogs  were  most  representatives  of  human  with  carbamate  hydrolysis predominating in both species.

Darunavir was mainly metabolised by CYP3A. In mice and rats darunavir treatment induced hepatic microsomal CYP3A4. UDP-GT activity was additionally induced in rats. In dogs, no induction effects were observed.

Darunavir is presented as a single enantiomer but no chiral inversion occurs in vivo .

## · Excretion

Following a single dose in rats, most radioactivity was excreted within 24 h and was almost complete in 96h. The predominant route of excretion for 14 C-darunavir was via the faeces and amounted to 94% in rats, 86% in dogs and 82% in humans. Urinary excretion was about 4% of the administered dose in rats and dogs but was higher in humans (12.2%). Unchanged darunavir was mainly excreted in feces and amounted to up to 12.3% in rats, 26% in dogs and 6.8% in humans. In rats, darunavir was also excreted via milk.

In a biliary excretion study in Sprague-Dawley rats, an average of 54% of the radioactivity was excreted in the bile during the 24h period after darunavir administration.

## · Pharmacokinetics drugs interaction

Six anti-HIV compounds were investigated for inhibitory effects in human liver microsomes. The  results  showed  that  saquinavir  and  amprenavir  are  predicted  to  be  minor  to  moderate inhibitors  of  darunavir  metabolism  in  vivo,  whereas  delavirdine,  ritonavir,  indinavir  and nelfinavir are likely to be strong inhibitors.

Darunavir  also  inhibits  P-gp  and  may  therefore  inhibit  transepithelial  permeation  of  P-gp substrates.

## Toxicology

A comprehensive toxicological programme was conducted in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits. Due to a more rapid clearance in animals, the maximum achieved exposure in animal studies was  low  compared  to  the  human  therapeutic  level,  and  adding  ritonavir  could  not  much further  enhance  it.  Likely,  this  difference  was  caused  by  the  fact  that  ritonavir  is  a  much stronger inhibitor of CYP3A4 in humans than in animals.

## · Single dose toxicity

Single dose toxicity studies were performed in mice, rats and dogs. The maximum achieved exposure was low, with an exposure at the highest dosages being lower or only slightly higher than the human exposure.

In  mice,  treatment  related  mortality  and  macroscopic  findings  (distended  or  fluid-filled gastro-intestinal tracts) occurred at oral doses ≥ 280 mg/kg.

In  rats,  there  was  no  treatment  mortality  or  toxicologically  relevant  observations  with  oral doses up to 471 mg/kg. In a second study, higher doses were used but the systemic exposure did not really increase to that observed with a dose of approximately 500 mg/kg.

In dogs, vomiting was the most obvious adverse effect occurring at the doses of 301 mg/kg limiting the maximum tolerated dose to 75 mg/kg.  The NOAEL in the IV dog study was 10 mg/kg.

Acute toxicity studies have not been conducted with the combination of darunavir and ritonavir which is acceptable in view of the repeated dose bridging studies which supersede the need for additional acute toxicity studies.

## · Repeated dose toxicity

Repeated  dose  oral  toxicity  of  darunavir  was  studied  up  to  6  months  in  rats  and  up  to  12 months  in  dogs.  In  addition  studies  have  been  conducted  with  the  administration  of  both darunavir and ritonavir. In dogs, exposure to darunavir did not increase and the combination was poorly tolerated  therefore  studies  longer  than  2  weeks  were  not  conducted  whereas  in mice the co-administration of darunavir with ritonavir was evaluated up to 6 months.

In  the  rat,  the  main  target  organs/systems  were  the  hematopoietic  system,  the  blood coagulation system, the liver and thyroid.

In the 6 months rat study, changes in the hematopoietic system consisted of increased reticulocyte and platelet counts, decreased haemoglobin levels and haemotocrit (at ≥ 20 mg/kg/day). An increased spleen weight and extramedullary haemotopoiesis was observed at ≥ 100 mg/kg/day and increase in red blood cell counts (RBC) at 500 mg/kg/day. These changes are indicative of increased turnover of red blood cells and this may be associated with the observed increased bilirubin levels in serum (at ≥ 20 mg/kg/day) and in the deposition of lipofuscin pigment in the hepatocytes (at ≥ 100 mg/kg/day). A toxic effect on the red blood cell system in rodents may be a class related effect, since it has also been observed with other protease inhibitors. Increased white blood cell counts were also seen, but only in males. There were also changes in the blood coagulation system at 500 mg/kg/day consisting of increased platelet counts and a prolonged PT and APPT times. These changes were not associated with any evidence of bleedings. The mechanism behind this effect is unknown,

9/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

however the relevance of this finding is probably low since increased platelet counts have not been reported in other species and no related adverse events have been reported in clinical studies. In the kidney, lipofuscin pigment in the proximal tubules was seen in males and females at ≥ 100 mg/kg/day. Several clinical biochemistry parameters were altered by treatment with darunavir, mainly increases in bilirubin (at ≥ 20 mg/kg/day), some liver enzymes, cholesterol, protein and reduced triglyceride levels were confined to 100 and 500 mg/kg/day. Changes in serum cholesterol and lipid are known adverse reactions of protease inhibitors probably secondary to the effects on the liver.

Many of the above-mentioned effects were also seen in the 2 week and 3 month rat study. Based on the 6 month rat study, the no adverse effect level (NOAEL) for darunavir was 20 mg/kg/day, leading to a safety margin less than 1. At this dose, there were slight increases in reticulocyte count, potassium and bilirubin in the males in the absence of histopathological changes.

In dogs, there were only limited effects of treatment with darunavir up to the highest doses in the 3 and 6 months studies. Hepatocellular pigment, vacuolation, with a limited increase in alkaline phosphatase levels were seen at 12 months of treatment. The NOAEL was considered to be 30 mg/kg with exposure, leading to a safety margin less than 1 for human exposure.

## Combination studies with darunavir and ritonavir

Ritonavir  had  a  modest  effect  on  darunavir  exposure,  expressed  as  AUC,  in  rats  (4-fold increase),  but  not  in  dogs.  In  these  studies,  there  was  evidence  of  an  additive  effect  of  the combination  of  darunavir  and  RTV.  In  rats,  the  combination  of  darunavir  with  50  or  75 mg/kg/day  RTV  led  to  a  small  increase  in  effects  on  RBC  parameters,  liver  and  thyroid, compared to  exposure  to  darunavir  alone.  At  higher  doses  of  darunavir  ( ≥ 100  mg/kg/day), some  very  mild  in  grade  pancreatic  changes  were  observed  in  males  (increased  of  islets fibrosis in the pancreas). There was no safety margin, since, based on AUC values, this effect was seen at about 1.5 times of the recommended clinical dose of darunavir+ rtv (600/100 mg b.i.d.). The clinical relevance of this finding is not clear. PT and APPT times were decreased, after an initial increase.

In dogs, the combination of darunavir and RTV was poorly tolerated, causing a severe weight loss and markedly reduced food consumption. These effects were far less marked at 10 or 20 mg/kg/day.  Frequent  vomiting  was  an  issue  of  concern,  because  it  could  lead  to  wide variation in systemic exposure. Liver enzymes were increased in a study with RTV only. In  rats  and  dogs,  slight  changes  were  noticed  in  thymus  weight.  These  changes  were  not significant and not dose-related and as such they were considered not to be clinically relevant.

## · Genotoxicity

Darunavir was not mutagenic in the Ames assay at concentrations up to 3330 µg/plate, with or  without  metabolic  activation.  Darunavir  was  not  clastogenic  in  an  in  vitro  chromosomal aberration  test  in  primary  human  lymphocytes  at  concentrations  up  to  333  µg/ml,  with  or without  metabolic  activation  nor  in  an  oral  micronucleus  study  in  mice  with  doses  up  to 20000 mg/kg. The exposure was not measured in this study but based on other studies, it was expected to be only just similar to the human exposure, due to impossibility to increase the exposure in animals, limiting the value of the study. Nonetheless taken together all the results and the fact that darunavir belongs to a class of products which have been shown to be nongenotoxic till now, no further data was considered necessary. Genotoxicity studies with the combination  darunavir  with  ritonavir  were  not  performed  which  is  acceptable  as  neither compound alone was genotoxic.

## · Carcinogenicity

Two carcinogenicity studies in rats (doses up to 500 mg/kg/day) and mice (doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day) are ongoing. The submission of the results of these studies post-approval was considered acceptable in view of the clinical benefit for the intended patient population.

10/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Reproduction toxicity

A fertility and early embryonic development study was performed in rats. There was no effect on  male  or  female  fertility  up  to  doses  producing  effects  on  body  weight  gain  (1000 mg/kg/day).  In  females,  the  number  of  corpora  lutea  and  implantations  decreased  at  1000 mg/kg/day and as a result also the number of live foetuses. The NOAEL was 200 mg/kg/day.

Embryo-foetal development studies were performed in rats, rabbits and mice. The mice were chosen as a third species, because darunavir exposure in the rabbit appeared to be very low and  the  applicant  justified  that  mainly  for  practical  reasons,  it  was  not  possible  to  apply  a twice-daily  dosing  scheme  in  rodents.  In  mice,  embryo-foetal  development  was  also investigated in combination with ritonavir, to increase exposure to darunavir. Darunavir was not embryotoxic or teratogenic in rats (NOAEL = 1000 mg/kg/day), rabbits (NOAEL = 1000 mg/kg/day) or mice.

Pre- and postnatal development was investigated in rats, also in combination with ritonavir. In  F1  animals,  body  weight  gain  was  reduced,  especially  during  lactation  but  also  postweaning. A slight delay was observed in the opening of the eyes and ears. In combination with ritonavir, the percentage of pups that exhibited the startle response on lactation day 15 was reduced. Furthermore, the combination of darunavir and ritonavir caused a reduced pup survival during lactation at 1000/50 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for the F1 generation was 40 mg/kg/day.

## · Local tolerance

As darunavir is administered orally, no studies evaluating local tolerance were considered necessary

A local lymph node assay was provided showing that darunavir did not cause skin sensitisation in mice.

## · Other toxicity studies

In  juvenile  rats  that  were  directly  dosed  on  days  12  -  25  of  life,  mortality  was  increased already at the lowest dose of 40 mg/kg. Effects included a distended abdomen, an unsteady gait  and  in  some  of  the  animals  convulsions.  The  increased  toxicity  in  juvenile  rats  was probably due to a higher exposure as already highlighted in the pharmacokinetic section.

No immunotoxicity was observed in a T-cell dependent antibody response test in rats after administration  of  darunavir  at  exposures  which  were  similar  to  or  just  below  human exposures (higher dose 500 mg/kg). Also in combination with ritonavir (100/50 mg/kg) no immunotoxicity was observed (exposure of darunavir below human exposure).

The impurities have been sufficiently toxicologically qualified.

## · Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An assessment of the risk was performed. Phase I calculations resulted in a PEC of 6 µg/l. As the action limit was exceeded, the applicant conducted a Phase II assessment. The risk to the aquatic environment, the terrestrial compartment and the STP is acceptable. An assessment of bio-concentration factor is not needed. Darunavir is neither very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) nor (persistent bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT). The limit of quantification is 54 µg/l hence not suitable for monitoring of drinking water quality. The water-sediment study is ongoing, the results of which will be provided post-authorisation.

## 4. Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The clinical programme consisted of:

- -studies  aiming  to  characterise  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  darunavir  following single and multiple administration, with or without low dose of ritonavir;
- -two phase II, randomised, open label, controlled proof-of-concept studies in treatment experienced patients (TMC114-C201 and TMC114-C207).
- -two  phase  IIb,  randomised,  partially  blinded,  controlled,  dose  finding  studies  in  3classes  experienced  patients  (TMC114-C202  and  TMC114-C213  also  known  as POWER1 and POWER2)
- -two open label trials in protease inhibitors experienced patients (TMC114-C215 and C208. The analysis of data from subjects who initiated treatment at the recommended dose is known as the POWER3 analysis).

The  design  of  the  two  controlled  studies,  which  have  become  the  main  trials  have  been discussed in the context of a Scientific Advice.

12/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At the recommended dose of 600 mg to be co-administered with low dose of ritonavir (100 mg as pharmacokinetic enhancer) twice daily with food, the approved indication is:

'PREZISTA, co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in highly pre-treated adult patients who failed more than one regimen containing a protease inhibitor (PI).

This indication is based on week-24 analyses of virological and immunological response from 2 controlled dose range finding Phase II trials and additional data from uncontrolled studies (see section 5.1).

In deciding to initiate treatment with PREZISTA co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir careful consideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of mutations associated with different agents. Genotypic or phenotypic testing (when available) and treatment history should guide the use of PREZISTA.'

## Good Clinical Practices

The clinical studies included a statement regarding conduct in accordance with Good Clinical Practices.  The  applicant  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted outside the Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetics  of  darunavir  administered  alone  or  with  low-dose  ritonavir  were evaluated in thirty-five Phase I trials involving 748 healthy subjects, as well as in 1 Phase I trial  in  HIV-1  infected  patients.  In  addition,  data  derived  from  patients  involved  in  other studies were used in 3 population pharmacokinetic analyses. A large number of interactions studies  have  also  been  submitted,  some  reflecting  the  variability  in  the  formulations  used throughout the development of darunavir (oral solution, suspension, capsules and tablets). The  analytical  methods  used  to  measure  darunavir  and  ritonavir  have  been  adequately validated.

## Absorption

Under fed conditions, the oral bioavailability of darunavir administered alone was approximately  37%.  When  combined  to  ritonavir  it  increased  to  approximately  82%, indicating that ritonavir strongly inhibits the first pass metabolism.

Following oral dose of 600 mg darunavir co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily (bid),  darunavir  was  rapidly  absorbed  with  maximal  peak  plasma  concentrations  observed after about 2.5 - 4 h (Cmax 5627 ± 923.5 ng/ml, AUC ∞ , 92340 ± 20020 ng.h/ml). Low dose ritonavir increased the dose-normalised Cmax and AUClast of darunavir by 191% and 1316%, respectively, giving a near to 14-fold increase in darunavir exposure.

As for other protease inhibitors, darunavir is a P-gp substrate.

Systemic  exposure  increased  dose  proportionally  following  ritonavir  boosted  single  doses ranging  400  mg-1200  mg  but  not  after  multiple  dosing.  This  non-linearity  may  be  due  to induction of metabolising enzymes and/or saturable plasma proteins binding with increasing concentrations. There was no indication that the elimination half-life was dependent of dose or  affected  by  repeated  administration.  Steady  state  was  achieved  within  4  days  with  or without ritonavir boosting and no accumulation was observed. With ritonavir, no indication of auto-induction  or  time  dependency  was  observed  in  the  steady  state  predose  levels  of darunavir.

13/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Inter-individual  variability  in  darunavir  pharmacokinetics  (AUC  and  Cmax)  was  estimated between  30  -  60%  after  un-boosted  single  dose  and  about  35  %  after  multiple  dose administration. When boosted, the inter-individual variability was reduced to about 25 - 35% after single and multiple doses. There is currently no data on intra-individual variability but this will be further addressed post-authorisation.

## Bioequivalence and effects on food

Opposite food effects on the bioavailability of darunavir were observed for the clinical trial formulation TF019 (oral solution) and TF036 (400 mg tablet). Whereas food decreased the mean Cmax and AUClast values obtained with the oral solution by 33% and 13%, respectively, (with 90% CI around the ratios that did not span 1.0 and p values &lt; 0.05), it increased these values seen with the tablets by 35% and 42%, respectively (with 90% CI around the ratios that did not span 1.0 and p values &lt; 0.05). The mechanism for the observed opposite effect of food  on  the  bioavailability  of  darunavir  for  the  solution  compared  to  tablet  has  not  been elucidated. The solution TF019 was nonetheless an early clinical formulation not intended for commercial use.

The food effect was further looked at in study C143 where the F014 tablet (commercial/Phase III  400-mg  tablet  formulation)  was  administered  with  100  mg  ritonavir  b.i.d.,  under  fasted conditions and different fed conditions. Because the F014 tablet is dose proportional with the F016 commercial/Phase III 300 mg film-coated tablet, the results can be extrapolated. The results of this study are displayed in table 1:

Based on the results, which showed that food increased darunavir bioavailability, darunavir should be taken with ritonavir as recommended in the Summary of Product Characteristics. The Phase IIb efficacy and safety trials required food intake.

An extensive  bioavailability/bioequivalence  programme  was  carried  out  to  characterise  the difference between formulations.

In  order  to  bridge  the  early  oral  solution  TF019  formulation  to  the  clinical  trial  tablet formulation (F001 uncoated 400 mg tablet), a cross-over design trial was conducted which showed that darunavir exposure was within the limits of bioequivalence for the oral solution and clinical trial tablet, when administered with food and with low-dose ritonavir.

In  another  single  dose  trial  under  fasted  conditions,  no  bioequivalence  could  be  shown between the F002 uncoated 200 mg tablet and the F016 commercial/Phase III 300 mg filmcoated tablet (AUC0-t: ratio 1.33, 90% CI 1.22 - 1.47, Cmax : ratio 1.33, 90% CI 1.21 - 1.47), and between the F001 uncoated 400 mg tablet and the F016 tablet (AUC0-t: ratio 1.34, 90% CI 1.23 - 1.47, Cmax : ratio 1.23, 90% CI 1.13 - 1.33). The effect was similar for the 200 and the 400 mg tablet, indicative for a similar bioavailability of the 200 mg tablet compared to the dose proportional 400 mg tablet. Sparse sampling data from patients treated with F001 tablets and  then  switched  to  F016  tablets  also  confirmed  higher  bioavailability  (37%)  for  the commercial formulation.

To address the concern over non-demonstration of bioequivalence, the applicant conducted two  additional  trials  (C166  and  C168).    Study  C166,  an  open-label,  randomised  crossover trial, aimed to assess the rate and extent of absorption of darunavir following administration of the clinical trials formulation (F001, F002) and the F016 commercial/Phase III formulation at 3 dose levels, all in presence of low dose of ritonavir with food. The F016

14/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

commercial/Phase  III  tablet  showed  a  21%  greater  bioavailability  compared  to  the  clinical trial  tablets  F001/F002.  In  the  absence  of  low-dose  ritonavir  and  under  fed  conditions,  the commercial/Phase  III  tablets  exhibited  comparable  exposure  to  the  clinical  trial  tablet (F001/F002) (trial C168). At the 600-mg dose level, the darunavir exposure was comparable for the 2 formulations (13% higher for commercial/Phase III tablet). Similarly, at the 1200mg dose level, the darunavir exposure was comparable for the 2 formulations (8% higher for commercial/Phase III tablet).

The approach of conducting single-dose bioavailability trials was acceptable because of lack of time dependency  for  darunavir  combined  with  low-dose  ritonavir. The  additional bioavailability  trials  showed  that  the  administration  of  food  diminishes  the  differences  in exposure between commercial/ Phase III and the clinical trial tablets from 35% to 21%, in line with  the  described  differences  in patients  in  clinical  trials.  In  addition,  the  difference  in exposure between the commercial/ Phase III tablet and clinical trial tablet (21%) was similar at the 600-mg dose of darunavir whether the clinical trial tablets were administered as 200-mg + 400-mg tablets or as 3 x 200-mg tablets.

Additional data from study C166, also under clinical relevant conditions, bridge the F001 and the F016 tablets, and therefore the TF019 and the F016 formulations. As noticed before, the commercial F016 formulation had a 21% higher bioavailability than the  F001 clinical trial formulation. This may also account for the TF019 (vs. F016).

These data bridge also bioequivalence data from the oral TF019 solution, as this solution is bioequivalent with the TF036 tablet (= F001 tablet), under clinically relevant conditions. The F016  tablets  can  therefore  be  expected  to  be  supra-bioavailable  to  the  oral  solution  to  a similar  extent  that  they  are  supra-bioavailable  to  the  TF036  tablets  used  in  the  Phase  IIb clinical studies.

## Distribution

The volume of distribution was about 88 l after i.v. administration of darunavir alone, and about 131 litres when co-administered with ritonavir.

Animal data indicate that darunavir distributes over the whole body, but high concentrations were observed in liver, adrenal gland, and the eye. Protein binding is concentration dependent and decreased from 96 to 92% over the clinical relevant concentration range of 0.1 - 7 µg/ml. The  concentration  dependency  of  plasma  protein  binding  is  within  the  physiologically relevant range. The Cmax of darunavir in human is about 10 μ g/ml, indicating that during a time-interval around the Tmax the free fraction can be up to 4 times higher than at other time intervals associated with lower darunavir concentrations.

Darunavir binds predominantly to α 1-acid  glycoprotein,  and  to  a  lesser  extend  to  albumin. The  blood  to  plasma  concentration  ratio  was  0.64,  indicative  for  some  distribution  to  red blood cells.

## Metabolism and elimination

In-vitro and in-vivo data indicate that darunavir undergoes extensive metabolism mainly by the CYP3A4 pathway. When radiolabelled darunavir was given without ritonavir about 50% of  the  radioactivity  in  plasma  was  due  to  darunavir  and  the  remaining  50%  was  due  to biotransformation  products.  After  boosting,  plasma  exposure  of  unchanged  compound increased to about 80%.

When  un-boosted,  darunavir  is  mainly  excreted  in  faeces  (85%)  and  about  12%  of  the administered dose could be recovered in urine, mainly as metabolites. Clearance was about 33 l/h and the elimination half-life about 12 hours.

After  boosting  with  ritonavir,  over  6  days,  about  14%  of  the  administered  dose  could  be recovered in urine and about 80% in faeces, of which 41% was as unchanged. Relative low percentages of compound identification were obtained, but this may be due to difficulties of metabolite identification in faeces. When boosted, a significant inhibition was observed in the carbamate  hydrolysis,  aliphatic hydroxylation  and  aromatic  hydroxylation.  In  addition excretion of glucuronide metabolites was increased.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

RTV boosting decreased considerably the plasma clearance of darunavir to 6 l/h, while the elimination half-life was not greatly affected (16 h).

## Special population

Preliminary pharmacokinetic data indicated that darunavir pharmacokinetics in subjects with mild  hepatic  impairment  (n  =  8,  Child  Pugh  A)  and  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (n  =  3, Child  Pugh  B)  were  comparable  to  those  in  healthy  subjects  (n  =  8)  following  600  mg darunavir  with  100  mg  ritonavir  (b.i.d).  Ritonavir  pharmacokinetics  in  subjects  with  mild hepatic impairment were comparable to those in healthy subjects, while ritonavir exposure in subjects  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  was approximately  60%  higher  than  that  in healthy subjects. Waiting for the final results of this study, to be provided post-authorisation, no dose adjustments are recommended for darunavir or ritonavir in mild and moderate hepatic impaired patients. In the absence of data, darunavir is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

Considering that the elimination of darunavir via the renal route is minimal, no impact of the impairment of the renal function is anticipated on the pharmacokinetics of darunavir. No dose adjustment is therefore recommended in patients with renal impairment.

The pharmacokinetics of darunavir have not yet been evaluated in children/adolescents but the applicant undertook to submit the results of the planned studies as part of the follow-up measures to be fulfilled post-authorisation.

Based on the population  pharmacokinetic  analyses,  no  impact  of  gender,  weight  or  race  is anticipated  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  darunavir,  which  would  require  special  precautions. For  the  elderly,  because  only  limited  data  is  available,  a  warning  has  been  included  in  the Summary of Product Characteristics requiring caution.

## Pharmacokinetics in target population

In HIV infected patients a less than dose proportional increase was observed at steady state when darunavir was given with low dose ritonavir. With the 600 + 100 mg b.i.d. dose, trough levels  were  obtained  well  above  the  theoretical  target  for  minimum  concentrations  to  be maintained  (550  ng/ml).  Darunavir  exposure  in  HIV  infected  patients  was  higher  than  that observed in healthy subjects. The  mean steady state Cmax levels ranged from 6008 -9200 ng/ml (10.1 - 15.5 μ g/ml). The population pharmacokinetic analyses suggested that this may in  part  be  explained  by  the  higher α 1-acid  glycoprotein  levels  in  HIV  infected  patients compared to healthy subjects.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

In vitro data showed that darunavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and to a lesser degree CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6.  CYP1A2  and  CYP2B6  were  only  slightly  inhibited  at  the highest darunavir concentration (100 µM) while no inhibition of CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 could be detected. Darunavir appeared also to induce CYP enzymes. In vitro studies showed that darunavir may also inhibit P-gp.

In vivo interactions involving CYP3A4 metabolism are likely to be extensive and most of the submitted interaction studies focussed on the possible interaction on this level.

An overview of the results from studies interaction is presented in table 2.

A  study  was  conducted  in  healthy  volunteers  with  rifabutin  however  it  was  prematurely discontinued due to adverse events.  Although no conclusion could be drawn, since rifabutin is an inducer and substrate of CYP450 enzymes, increase in rifabutin exposure and decrease in darunavir exposure can be expected.

In  addition  to  the  drug  interaction  studies  completed,  the  applicant  has  performed  a  drug screen for the HIV-1 infected patients enrolled into C215 treated with F016 at 600/100 mg b.i.d. Differences in median darunavir AUC24h values ranged from -22% (gemfibrozil) to 33% (clotrimazole).  No  apparent  effects  on  darunavir  exposure  were  seen  on  co-administration with any of the NRTIs. There was a trend towards somewhat higher plasma concentrations of darunavir  (up  to  approximately  20%)  when  azole  anti-fungal  agents  were  co-administered. Concomitant  systemic  use  of  clotrimazole  and  darunavir  co-administered  with  100  mg ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of darunavir. Caution is warranted and careful clinical  monitoring  is  recommended,  when  co-administration  of  systemic  clotrimazole  is required.

Considering the concentration dependent protein binding indicative for saturation of binding, interactions  due  to  drug-protein  displacement  cannot  be  ruled  out.  A  warning has  therefore been included in the SPC. In addition the applicant undertook to further measure unbound and total darunavir concentrations to elucidate possible displacement problems.

Based  on  the  different  elimination  pathways  of  the  other  NRTIs  zidovudine,  zalcitabine, emtricitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, that are primarily renally excreted, and didanosine and abacavir which metabolism is not mediated by CYP450, no interactions are expected.

Based  on  the  results  of  the  studies,  the  appropriate  warnings  and  recommendation  have

therefore been included in the SPC.

The applicant undertook to provide data of ongoing interaction studies using the recommended  clinical  dose  and  the  commercial  formulation  either  as  part  of  the  specific obligations (rifabutin and didanosine) or the follow-up measures (methadone, lopinavir/ritonavir,  rifabutin,  didanosine,  buprenorphine/naloxone,  carbamazepine,  in  vivo cocktail  trial  to  determine  the  effects  of  steady  state  darunavir  with  low  dose  ritonavir (600/100 mg bid) on the metabolism of CYP probe substrates 2D6, 2C19 and 2C9 and further investigation on potential inhibition of CYP 2C8) to be fulfilled post-authorisation.

## Pharmacodynamics

## Darunavir Resistance profile

The  influence  of  baseline  genotype  and  phenotype  on  the  virologic  outcome  and  on  the development  of  mutations  to  darunavir/ritonavir  treatment  was  studied  in  the  pooled  data from the clinical  trials  TMC114-C202, TMC114-C213, TMC114-C215 and TMC114-C208 (see  next  section  for  details  of  study  designs).  Phenotypic  and  genotypic  testing  was performed using Antivirogram and VirtualPhenotype testing methods respectively.

Conservative  analyses,  using  3 response  parameters  ( ≥ 1 log10 decrease  in  viral  load,  viral load  &gt; 50 copies/ml,  and  change  in  log10  viral  load  at  Week 24)  to  assess  the  influence  of individual protease mutations at baseline on the virologic outcome at Week 24, show that the following protease mutations at baseline were associated with a lower than overall response to darunavir + rtv (600+100 mg b.i.d.):

- -decrease of ≥ 1.0 log10: V11I, V32I, I47V, I50V, I54L or M, L76V and/or I84V
- change versus baseline in log10: V11I, V32I, I47V and/or I54L or M
- viral load &lt; 50 copies/ml: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54L or M, G73S, L76V, I84V and/or L89V.

Among those, V11I, V32I, I47V and I54L or M, were identified using all 3 parameters of response. The table 3 presents the observed effects in mean change versus baseline in log10 Viral Load.

In addition, a reduced virologic response (decrease ≥ 1.0 log10 in viral load versus baseline at Week 24 or a viral load &lt; 50 copies/ml at Week 24) was observed in subjects with ≥ 7   PI resistance-associated mutations (any change at positions 30, 32, 36, 46, 47, 48, 50, 53, 54, 73, 82, 84, 88, or 90), or in subjects with ≥ 10  PI resistance-associated mutations from the 2004

* Number of mutations from the list of mutations associated with a diminished response to PREZISTA/ritonavir (V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54L or M, G73S, L76V, I84V or L89V)

Mutations at V32I, L33F, I47V, I54L and L89V developed in viruses from at least 10% of the patients with virological failure (never reaching &gt;1.0 log10 decrease or rebound from a &gt;1.0 log 10 decrease). The development of these mutations was associated with a median darunavir FC increase of 8.14 at endpoint compared to baseline.

Mutations at V32I and I54L were the most common mutations that developed in &gt; 20% of the virological  failures.  Overall,  in  the  rebounders  a  median  increase  of  8.14  at  endpoint compared to baseline was found in darunavir FC.

## Cross-resistance

The data from laboratory studies in clinical isolates are under the pharmacology section.

The  baseline  phenotypic  data  of  trials  C202,  C213,  and  C215/C208  showed  that  for  each individual  PI  (indinavir,  ritonavir,  nelfinavir,  saquinavir,  amprenavir,  lopinavir,  atazanavir), resistance  was  &gt;  79%  for  the  subset  of patients  sensitive  to  darunavir  (FC ≤ 10,  N=661). In contrast, viruses from almost all of the subjects resistant to darunavir (FC &gt; 10, N = 287) were also resistant to the other PIs. An analysis of the cross-resistance between darunavir and amprenavir  showed  that  the  majority  (63%)  of  samples  with  decreased  susceptibility  to amprenavir remained susceptible to darunavir, irrespectively of previous use

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of  (fos)amprenavir. Virological response data for patients who have failed amprenavir or who harbour viruses resistant to amprenavir indicated that darunavir+ rtv at the recommended dose was effective in most of these patients. There is currently not enough experience to conclude on potential cross-resistance with tipranavir.

## Relationship plasma concentration and effect

PK/PD relationship was investigated on the basis of the dose finding studies TMC114-C202 and  TMC114-C213.  Logistic  regression  models  were  applied,  including  the  covariates baseline  log10  viral  load,  number  of  sensitive  NRTIs  in  the  OBR,  darunavir  log10  FC  at baseline, and use of enfuvirtide in the OBR. The pharmacokinetics of darunavir (AUC24h and C0h)  were  statistically  significantly  associated  with  all  response  parameters  at  Week  24. However, these relationships were not as strongly correlated as darunavir log10 FC at baseline and use of enfuvirtide in the OBR.

The  inhibitory  quotient  (IQ),  reflecting  the  ratio  between  the  concentration  of  darunavir achieved in plasma and the darunavir FC at baseline, was the strongest predictor of virologic response. The relationship between IQ and percent virologic response is driven primarily by the  darunavir  FC  at  baseline  and  less  by  exposure  to  darunavir.  Therefore  darunavir  FC  at baseline was considered to be the most important prognostic factor with regard to response.

## Secondary pharmacology

In study C153, darunavir/ritonavir (F001 tablets) was given at 1600/100 mg once daily and at 800/100 mg twice daily for 7 days and ECG changes were compared with those seen during dosing with moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily or placebo, each for 7 days, in a 4-way crossover design.  Dosing  was  after  standard  meals  on  testing  facility  days  and  pharmacokinetic  data were obtained  on  days  1  and  7.  Darunavir  elicits  small  increases  in  QTc  and  PR  intervals compared to placebo, which are probably not of clinical significance.

The  PK/PD  did  not  show  any  relationship  found  between  exposure  and  safety  parameters, vital signs, or ECG parameters. Therefore there is no need for therapeutic drug monitoring to guide the use of darunavir in clinical practice.

## Dose ranging studies

In  these  early  studies,  patients  randomised  to  the  darunavir  treatment  group  received  the TF019  oral  solution  (20  mg/ml)  as  a  substitute  for  all  PIs  in  the  failing  therapy.  Patients randomised to the control group continued their current therapy.

In study TMC-C201 darunavir was administered in the fasting state and without RTV in doses of 400 mg b.i.d, 800 mg b.i.d, 800 mg t.i.d, 1200 mg t.i.d. The NRTI regimen was to remain unchanged  until the end of the treatment period . Due  to availability of data  from pharmacokinetic studies that showed a boosting effect of RTV, only 34 patients (30 males with mean age around 40 years) were enrolled. The median duration of HIV infection was 7.33  years  (0.1  -  21  years)  and  half  of  the  patients  had  CDC  classification  C  disease.  Ten patients  (29.4%)  were  taking  a  single  PI  at  screening,  18  (52.9%)  a  single  boosted  PI,  1 (2.9%) a double PI and 5 (14.7%) a double boosted PI. Of the 34, 33 had clade B virus with a

23/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

baseline median log10 viral load of 4.12 and median CD4 count of 320 x 10 6 /l.  Overall,  16 patients (47%), including 4 in the control group, had virus resistant to all currently approved PIs  while  12  (35.3%)  had  virus  susceptible  to  2  or  more.  The  median  fold  change  in  EC 50 values (FC) for darunavir at baseline for those who started treatment was 1.60 (range 1.20 to 2.56 for darunavir groups but the median FC for the control group was 9.80).

A dose related anti-viral activity (change in log10 viral load from baseline on Day 14) was observed: the median changes in log10 viral load from baseline were -0.313, -0.818, -1.124, and -0.691 log10  copies/ml  for  the  increasing  dose  groups,  respectively  versus  +0.210  log10 copies/ml for the control group.

In  study  TMC114-C207  darunavir  was  co-administered  with  RTV  in  the  fed  state  to  HIV infected  patients  in  doses  of  300/100  mg  b.i.d.,  600/100  mg  b.i.d.,  900/100  mg  q.d.).  The study design was generally similar to that of C201, including the fact that patients on failing regimens  that  included  NNRTIs  were  not  eligible.  There  were  50  patients  randomised  and treated in the study of which 46 were male with a mean age of around 40 years. The median baseline log10 viral load was 4.26 copies/ml, the median baseline CD4 count was 305 x 10 6 /l and 23 patients were of CDC classification C. At screening, 40 were taking a boosted PI of which  27  were  taking  lopinavir/ritonavir.  Phenotypic  data  indicated  that  25  patients  (51%) had virus resistant to all currently approved PIs while 13 had virus that was susceptible to 2 or more PIs. The median fold resistance value for darunavir was 1.70 with a range for other PIs from  5.30  to  92.40.  Patients  had  a  broad  range  of  protease  mutations  at  baseline  with  a median of 3 primary PI mutations and a median of 6 primary and secondary mutations.

A dose related anti-viral activity was observed. The DAVG (time averaged difference) of the plasma  viral  load  response  over  a  2-week  treatment  observed  in  each  darunavir/ritonavir group were statistically superior to the control arm (p&lt;0.001 for all comparisons).  -0.56 log10 for the 300/100 mg b.i.d. group, -0.70 log10 for the 900/100 mg q.d. group, and -0.81 log10 for the 600/100 mg b.i.d. group , versus -0.03 log10 for the control group.

At the highest dose (600 mg/100 mg b.i.d) the highest darunavir exposure was achieved and the mean trough darunavir concentration were approximately 2000 ng/ml (compared to 350 ng/ml with 1200 mg t.i.d darunavir in the C201 study).

On  the  basis  of  these  studies  the  applicant  considered  that  combination  of  darunavir  with ritonavir was justified. The applicant further provided data to bridge bioequivalence between the oral solution and the commercial/Phase III tablet. The proof of principle studies and their relevance to dose finding Phase IIb studies can therefore be considered acceptable.

## Main studies

The demonstration of efficacy of the proposed dose regimen for boosted darunavir is based on two ongoing Phase II randomised, controlled, partially blinded trial studies:

TMC-114C202: investigating the dose response of darunavir with low dose of ritonavir in 3class-experienced HIV-1  infected patients, followed by an open-label period on the recommended dose of darunavir with low dose of ritonavir.

TMC-114C213 : investigating the efficacy, safety, and dose-response relationship of darunavir with low dose ritonavir in 3-class-experienced HIV-1 infected patients, followed by an open-label period on the recommended dose of darunavir with low dose of ritonavir

## Methods

## · Study Participants

In study TMC-114-C202, the main inclusion criteria were:

- Male or female HIV-1 infected patients aged 18 years and older;
- Patients receiving a PI-containing regimen at screening, initiated at least 8 weeks prior to screening, with plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt; 1000 copies/ml (assayed by RNA PCR Standard specimen procedure);
- 'Three-class-experienced' defined as follows:
- o The initial protocol stated that patients had to have received at least two different PIs for at  least  3  months  but  was  changed  in  February  2004  to  at  least  one  PI  for  at  least  3 months. Patients were to have at least 1 primary PI mutation at screening as defined by the IAS-USA guidelines (i.e. D30N, M46I/L, G48V, I50V/L, V82A/F/T/S, I84V, L90M). The original protocol set a 30% limit on the proportion of patients that might be enrolled with ≥ 3 primary PI mutations but this was later removed by amendment and any patients previously excluded could be re-screened.
- o Prior  treatment  was  also  to  be  with ≥ 2  NRTIs  for  at  least  3  months  in  total  and ≥ 1 NNRTI in a failing regimen (based on virological response or tolerability) but patients on antiretroviral therapy that contained an NNRTI  at  screening were excluded.  An amendment of February 2004 allowed for patients with documented NNRTI resistance to be enrolled even if there was no history of NNRTI use.
- o Investigational  agents  counted  as  prior  exposure  but  were  not  allowed  in  screening  or optimised background regimens (OBR).

## Main exclusion criteria were:

- Presence of any currently active AIDS defining illness (Category C conditions according to the Center for Disease Control [CDC] Classification System for HIV Infection 1993) with the following exceptions: - Stable cutaneous Kaposi's Sarcoma and - Wasting syndrome due to HIV infection
- Previously demonstrated clinically significant allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of the investigational medications, with the exception of sulphonamide allergy although darunavir is a sulphonamide;
- Patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of active liver disease, liver impairment/dysfunction or cirrhosis irrespective of liver enzyme levels.

In study TMC-114-C213, the main inclusion/exclusion criteria were the same as for trial C202, with the exception that patients co-infected with hepatitis B or C were allowed to enter the trial if their condition was clinically stable and would not require treatment during the study period. Patients diagnosed with hepatitis A at screening were not allowed in the trial.

## Treatment

The trials included:

- A screening period, which lasted a maximum of 6 weeks (Part S + A) and included a 2-week period (Part A) after randomisation during which the patients remained on the regimen used at screening.

In study C202, for patients randomised to the darunavir/ritonavir treatment groups, the trial included:

- A functional monotherapy period (2 weeks) during which patients substituted the PI(s) in the regimen from screening for one of four treatment groups of darunavir + rtv (Part B1) but had to remain on their background NRTIs with or without enfuvirtide.

The four darunavir+rtv treatment groups were as follows:  400/100 mg q.d., 800/100 mg q.d., 400/100 mg b.i.d. and 600/100 mg b.i.d.

25/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During the dose-finding parts of these studies darunavir was supplied as 200 mg (F002) or 400 mg (F001) tablets, each coming from several different batches. In the 600/100 mg b.i.d. group  1x400  mg  +  1x  200  mg  darunavir  tablet  was  taken  twice  daily  while  only  400  mg tablets were used in the other groups. Patients were to take darunavir+ rtv orally within 30 minutes after completion of a meal every 12 or 24 hours as allotted. Whenever possible, the OBR and darunavir+ rtv were taken at the same time.

Investigators were provided with genotypic viral resistance data in order to construct an OBR for each patient according to these results and treatment history.

- -Prior  to  randomisation,  and  based  on  the  screening  resistance  data  and  prior antiretroviral  (ART)  history,  the  investigator  selected  a  PI(s)-regimen  and  an  OBR consisting of NRTIs with or without enfuvirtide.
- -If the 3-class experienced patients had virus that showed resistance to all 3 classes it was advised to add a new class, if possible.
- -If patients had virus resistant to all PIs it was recommended to use a new treatment regimen that included either a boosted PI or dual (boosted) PI combination. Patients randomised to the control group received the pre-selected PI(s) during the treatment period while all the others received their assigned darunavir+ rtv regimen instead. At least one PI had to be added to the OBR for control group patients.
- -Patients on NNRTIs at screening were not eligible and NNRTIs were not allowed in any group during the study.
- -Tipranavir was not allowed in the control group.
- -Abacavir was disallowed during the trial. However, if patients receiving abacavir at screening without problems of tolerance for at least 8 weeks could continue with this as part of their OBR but could not discontinue abacavir and restart after screening.
- -Enfuvirtide was allowed in all groups.

The OBR (for control and darunavir+ rtv groups) and the investigator-selected PI(s) regimen (for  controls)  were  not  to  be  changed  until  the  end  of  the  treatment  period  unless  this  was necessary due to tolerability/toxicity reasons. Medications that might be expected to have a clinically significant interaction with darunavir were banned.

Both studies are still ongoing and have a treatment duration of 144 weeks.

## · Objective

In the original protocols, the primary objective was to evaluate the dose-response relationship of antiviral activity of the darunavir +ritonavir dose regimens at 24 weeks. Based on planned interim analyses (week 16 and 24) which showed a higher antiviral activity of darunavir+ritonavir than expected (as presented under the results), all randomised patients switched to the recommended dose of darunavir+ritonavir (600 mg+100 mg b.i.d) and the primary objective was amended to compare all darunavir+ritonavir dose groups (TMC114C202 + TMC114-C213) with control at Week 24 by means of confirmed virologic response.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

Following amendment of the objective of the studies, the primary endpoint was switched from change in viral load from baseline, to virologic response defined as at least 1.0 log10 decrease in viral load versus baseline at week 24.

The main secondary outcomes included:

- Proportion of patients with at least 1.0 log10 / 0.5 log10 drop (time to loss of virologic response = TLOVR) in plasma viral load (compared to baseline) at all other time points, and time to achieve this.
- Proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels &lt; 50 copies/ml / &lt; 400 copies/ml (TLOVR) at each time point, and time to achieve this.

- DAVG (time averaged difference) of log10 plasma viral load over 24 weeks , which was defined as the AUC of the change in log10 plasma viral load from baseline divided by the time treated in the trial. Plasma viral load values below 50 copies/ml (assay detection limit) were scored as 49 in the calculation of the DAVG.

Virological failure was defined as lack or loss of response in the trial: less than 0.5 log10 reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA from baseline beyond Week 12 (1 confirmatory result required with either a planned or an unscheduled visit). These patients could be eligible for the roll-over trial (TMC114-C215).

## · Sample size

Power  calculation  in  the  original  protocols  were  based  on  the  original  primary  antiviral activity  parameter  -  change  in  plasma  viral  load  at  Week  24.  When  the  primary  efficacy parameter was amended the sample size was not revisited.

The study reports stated that to detect at least a 0.5 log10 change in plasma viral load decrease at Week 24 of the highest compared to the lowest darunavir dose group (with a common SD of 1), with 80% power at a significance level of 5% (one-sided), 51 patients were required per treatment group. To account for the effect of discontinuations on the primary parameters, 60 per group were needed for intent to treat (ITT) analysis.

## · Randomisation

A central randomisation (IVRS) system was used for the dose-finding part of the trial.

Three stratification factors were identified for randomisation and were subsequently used in the statistical analysis as covariates in the analysis models:

- Screening plasma viral load (&lt; 20000, ≥ 20000 copies/ml)
- Use of enfuvirtide (part of the OBR or not)
- Number of Primary PI mutations at baseline (1, 2, 3 or more)

Given the low numbers per treatment group an adaptive minimisation technique with biased coin assignment was used to try to achieve balance across treatment groups in each stratum.

## · Blinding

The dose-finding part of the study was partially blinded. Patients knew whether they were in the control or in the treatment group  with  darunavir+  ritonavir and  patients in the darunavir+ritonavir groups as well as the investigators and sponsor were aware of whether a once or twice daily regimen was administered. Nonetheless none was aware of the actual dose allotted within the once or twice daily groups.

## · Statistical methods

All statistical tests were interpreted at the 5% two-sided significance level. The significance level alpha was adjusted accounting for the Week 24 formal testing. There was no formal adjustment for the first (Week 16) interim analysis.

The  intent-to-treat  population  was  used  as  primary  population  and  comprised  all  patients randomised  and  treated  with  baseline  or  post-baseline  data,  regardless  of  their  compliance with the protocol or their eligibility.

## Planned interim analyses

There  were  2  Data  Safety  Monitoring  Board  interim  analyses  at  weeks  8  and  12  with  the objective  of  protection  of  human  subjects.  There  were  two  other  formal  pre-specified combined interim analyses of both trials at 16 and 24 weeks to define the recommended dose which would have to be used in confirmatory studies (at week 16 when 150 patients in each

trial had completed 16 weeks of treatment and at week 24 when 150 patients in each trial had completed 24 weeks of treatment).

The primary analysis  of  trial  C213  was  performed  as  planned  per  protocol,  i.e.,  when  300 subjects reached Week 24 or discontinued earlier. Based on the planned visit dates, a cut-off date of 1 February 2005 was determined. All data up to this cut-off date were included in the primary analysis of this trial. Due to over-recruitment, there were 318 subjects in the trial, of which 17 did not reach Week 24 or discontinued earlier at the time of the 1 February 2005 cut-off.  The  applicant  decided  not  to  wait  for  these  last  17  subjects,  as  they  would  not influence the conclusions.

Trial C202 included a more resistant population, and a clinically significant difference would be  observed  between  the  lowest  dose  of  darunavir+rtv  and  the  recommended  dose.  The applicant used therefore same data cut-off date.

From  1 February  2005  onwards,  subjects  randomised  to  darunavir+rtv  400/100 mg  q.d., 800/100 mg q.d., or 400/100 mg b.i.d. were switched to the recommended dose of darunavir+ rtv 600/100 mg b.i.d.

An additional analysis was performed with a later cut-off date (September 2005).

Although both interim analyses were not intended to stop or change the design of the current trial, the significance level alpha was adjusted accounting for the Week 24 formal testing by means of the O'Brien and Fleming method, using alpha = 0.0054 for the Week 24 interim analysis, and 0.0492 for the week 24 primary analysis.

The nominal significance level (alpha) was adjusted for multiple comparisons versus control by means of Bonferroni-Holms multiple testing procedure.

## RESULTS

## Patients flow

The cut-off date for the primary efficacy analysis was 1 February 2005.

For study TMC114-C202, 278 patients were included in the primary analysis, of whom 201 had reached 24 weeks of treatment or discontinued earlier.

For  study  TMC-114-213,  318  patients  were  included  of  whom  301  patients  had  reached week 24 or discontinued earlier.

Patient disposition for both studies is shown in tables 7 and 8 respectively.

Whereas about 5-20% discontinued from each darunavir + rtv regimen (lower than in C202), 62% discontinued in the control group (similar to C202). In both studies, the main reason for trial  discontinuation  was  virological  failure,  which  occurred  most  frequently  in  the  control groups.

## Conduct of the study

In study C202, major protocol deviations occurred in 3 patients in darunavir + rtv groups (1%) - 2 who took an additional PI for some of the treatment period and 1 took once daily

29/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

instead of twice daily assigned therapy. One patient in the control group did not have at least 1 primary PI mutation at screening.

In study C213, major protocol deviations occurred in 11 patients including 6 in the darunavir + rtv groups with disallowed changes to the OBR or, in 1, continuation of lopinavir/ritonavir for the first 8 days. Three patients in the control group had disallowed changes to the OBR and 1 took abacavir while it was not included in the selected OBR.

The limited number of protocol violations was not considered to have influenced the outcome of the trials.

## Baseline Characteristics

Demographic data and baseline disease characteristics were comparable across the treatment groups  in  both  studies.  Nonetheless  in  C213  there  was  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  coinfected with hepatitis B or C virus in the control group compared to the darunavir+rtv groups (21% versus 12%).

The population included in study C202 had more advanced disease than the one included in C213  as  shown  in  table  9  by  baseline  disease  characteristics,  treatment  experience,  and baseline CD4+ cell count.

In C202, based on the Antivirogram data at screening:

- -70.5% of all patients were infected with virus resistant to all commercially available PIs and 15.3% had virus susceptible to only 1 PI (see table 10).
- -94% had virus susceptible to at least one NRTI.
- -49% had virus susceptible to one or more NNRTIs (but NNRTIs were banned from the OBR).

30/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the control group 33% had virus that was susceptible to at least 1 PI at baseline. During the treatment period 21% received a PI to which their virus was susceptible at baseline compared to 6% at screening. Also, 15% of controls were treated with no ART that was predicted to be active based on susceptibility testing results and 42% received only one agent predicted to be active.

c protocol violators due to use of other PI(s) in combination with DRV/RTV

*in the darunavir groups the rate reflects ONLY the OBR (i.e. count does not include darunavir)

Forty nine percent of patients had 3 or more primary PI mutations at baseline (based on the March 2003 IAS-USA list). When using the updated list, this figure was 66%.

The incidence  of  the  primary  mutations  L33F/I,  M46I/L,  V82A/F/L/S/T,  I84A/C/V,  L90M was at least 30% or higher. Overall, the control group was comparable to the darunavir+ rtv groups  in  terms  of:  demographic  and  baseline  disease  characteristics,  genotyping  and phenotyping, including PI susceptibility,  previous  ARV  experience  and  optimisation  of  the OBR

31/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the control group, all PI regimens included ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. The most frequently used PI was amprenavir or fosamprenavir (42%) followed by saquinavir (30%) and lopinavir (28%).

In study C213 , based on the screening Antivirogram data:

- -63% had virus resistant to all available PIs and 17% had virus susceptible to only one PI. See the table 12.
- -97% had virus susceptible to at least one NRTI.
- -45% had virus susceptible to one or more NNRTIs. However, NNRTIs were banned.

In the control group 43% had virus that was susceptible to at least 1 PI at baseline. During the treatment period 33% (see table below) received a PI to which their virus was susceptible at baseline compared to 10% at screening. As in C202, 15% of controls were treated with no ART that was predicted to be active based on susceptibility testing results and 26% in C213 received only one agent to which the virus was predicted to be susceptible.

c protocol violators due to use of other PI(s) in combination with DRV/RTV, *in the darunavir groups the rate reflects ONLY the OBR (i.e. count does not include darunavir)

In the control group, almost all PI regimens (97%) were co-administered with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. The most frequently used PI was lopinavir (46%) followed by saquinavir (38%) and amprenavir or fosamprenavir (25%).

## Outcome

## Interim analysis

The combined interim analysis at week 16 showed an unexpectedly high decrease in viral load in increasing with the dose in the darunavir+ rtv groups. This was confirmed at the 24 week interim and primary analyses. These results supported the selection of darunavir+ rtv 600/100 mg b.i.d. as the optimal dose in treatment-experienced patients.

All darunavir+ rtv treatment groups showed significantly higher virological response rates than the control group. The higher daily dose level of darunavir+ rtv (600/100 mg b.i.d.) tended to result in higher virological response rate than the lower daily dose levels.

There  was  initially  a  concern  over  the  reliability  and  robustness  of  the  results  mainly  in relation  to  level  of  optimisation  of  the  OBRs  and  choice  of  PI  in  the  control  arm.  The applicant's analyses clearly showed that having at least one PI in the regimen to which the virus was  susceptible was  an  important  determinate  of  response. Also, responses  to enfuvirtide were improved when patients were on at least one ART to which the virus was susceptible.  The  applicant  showed  that  the  measures  taken  to  ensure  objectiveness  and reliability of the results and avoiding results-driven changes of endpoints during the different amendments of the protocols of these studies were satisfactory. The outlined procedures and value  of  resistance  data  in  determining  the  ART  for  treatment-experienced  patients  were consistent  with  the  state  of  the  art.  The  selection  of  specific  NRTIs  in  the  OBR  and  the predicted susceptibility of the selected NRTIs were comparable for the control and darunavir+ rtv  groups,  and  this  was  in  line  with  current  clinical  practice  in  treating  pre-treated  HIV-1 infected patients. The choice of the regimen was also affected by the treatment history of the patient  and  toxicity  of  the  ARV  agents.  Details  of  the  anti-viral  susceptibilities  of  all  the patients in C202 and C213 who did not receive any ART in their OBR that was predicted to be active against the patient's virus (except for darunavir in the test group) were provided. There was a very small minority of patients who did not use the recommended susceptible NRTI  (6/23  versus  2/20  responders  in  the  control)  but  this  is  unlikely  to  have  modified the conclusions of the trials. The applicant provided also reassuring information with respect to  the  choice  of  PI  in  the  control  group.  The  greater  majority  of  all  control patients  95/122 (78%) did not have a susceptible control PI option based upon vircoTYPE HIV-1. Of the 27 patients who  had  at  least  1  susceptible  PI,  only  2  patients  did  not  select  a PI for which vircoTYPE HIV-1 predicted susceptibility for acceptable reasons.

The overall enfuvirtide use, supporting the efforts made to offer optimal OBR to the patients, was similar in control arm and darunavir groups and accounted approximately for 45% - 40% in trials C202 and C213, respectively.

The rational for not using NNRTIs in both trials was considered acceptable and in line with present  guidelines.  NNRTIs  generally  should  not  be  used  following  the  development  of NNRTI-resistance due to nearly universal cross-class resistance among the currently available NNRTIs,  pre-treatment  or  failure  with  an  NNRTI  rapidly  leads  to  resurgence  of  archived

34/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

resistant mutants when an agent of the class is reintroduced. The proportion of patients pretreated with NNRTI was &gt;95% in the studied patient population.

The explorative comparative analysis of the overall antiretroviral efficacy of the regimens in the control arms of previous independent trials (RESIST, TORO) as well as C202 and C213 showed marked similarity. Issues such as compliance (very low non-compliance for the PI component) and very low discontinuation rates through weeks 12-16 did not appear to be a source of bias.

The sensitivity analysis performed, comparing virologic response in the subgroup of patients using darunavir+ rtv without any active drugs in the background versus control patients who were  'truly  optimised'  (i.e.,  those  receiving ≥ 2  active  drugs  in  the  OBR),  confirm  the favourable efficacy of darunavir+ rtv regimen.

In  addition  clarifications  of  all  formal  interim  analyses  that  were  performed  on  both  trials, their purpose, and consequent actions and informing the regulatory authorities were provided. The  change  in  primary  endpoint  to  response  rate,  which  is  in  line  with  the  CHMP  HIV guideline is considered a more conservative endpoint than change in log10 viral load and the results are considered robust.

As to the correction for inflation, when multiplicity is taken even in the most conservative approach, conclusions did not change. However, this only holds when during the trial, based on knowledge of the results, selection of likely responders did not occur. Although in- and exclusion criteria were amended during the trial, given that the effect size decreases from the first interim analysis to the final analysis selection was considered unlikely.

## Secondary efficacy endpoint results and other analyses.

In  both  trials,  results  obtained  for  the  other  virologic  response  categories  (defined  as  a decrease of viral load by at least 0.5 log10 relative to baseline, or proportion of patients with a viral load &lt; 400 or &lt; 50 copies/ml) confirmed the findings of the primary efficacy parameter.

With respect to immunological parameters (mean change CD4+ from baseline; % CD4+ cell count; mean change CD8+ from baseline and mean change from baseline ratio CD4+/CD8+) the  results  for  the  darunavir+  rtv  treatment  groups  were  better  than  for  the  control  in  both trials. A dose response relationship was more obvious in trial C213 than in trial C202.

Sensitivity  analyses  (including  all  subjects  in  the  darunavir+  rtv  groups  regardless  of compliance, while in the control group only subjects who were compliant were included - as determined  by  the  compliance  questionnaire  and  by  measurement  of  plasma  levels)  were performed the results of which corroborated the outcome and conclusions for both trials. The difference  in  non-compliance  cannot  explain  the  large  differences  observed  between  the

35/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

darunavir+ rtv and control group, and therefore, this sensitivity analysis confirms the overall superiority of darunavir+ rtv over control.

The applicant provided an updated 24-week analysis which included all randomised subjects in  both  trials  C202  and  C213  in  the  group  that  received  the  recommended  dose  of darunavir/ritonavir  at  initial  randomisation  (cut-off  of  24 September  2005).  The  estimated response rates remained stable and confirmed the conclusions from the primary analysis (table 19).

The applicant provided in a synoptic form an update of the efficacy data up to end May 2006 (see table 21). The updated information shows the efficacy of darunavir+ rtv at Week 72 in 65 subjects  in  each  trial.  Although  virologic  response  tended  to  decrease  over  time  with  the primary efficacy endpoint ( ≥ 1.0 log10 drop in viral load), response was sustained for up to at least Week 72 for the most stringent secondary efficacy endpoint (&lt; 50 copies/ml).

a Efficacy results at Week 48 in trials TMC114-C202 and TMC114-C213 and at Week 24 in trial TMC114-C215 (data up to the final MAA cut-off date) provided for reference.

In addition, subgroup analyses confirm the favourable efficacy of darunavir+ rtv 600/100 mg b.i.d: In both trials virologic response was greater in the darunavir+ rtv group compared to control taking into account the number of susceptible ARVs (excluding or including PIs) in the OBR based on descriptive analyses, although results should be taken with caution due to the very small numbers involved (but the trend is consistently favourable for the test regimen). The same holds for analysis based on a logistic regression model, with covariates baseline log10 viral load, number of primary PI mutations and the number of sensitive ARVs.

Influence of other factors on Darunavir Efficacy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Region . There were some differences between regions which can be explained by differences in patient disease characteristics and prior ART experience.

Gender . A total of 109 female patients were treated with darunavir. The response (change in viral load) was greater in females than in males. This was primarily due to better prognostic factors; the median baseline darunavir FC was 1.7 in females and 4.3 in males.

Age . There were no differences between the different age categories in adults. However, the number in the eldest age category (Age&gt;50) was rather small (187) and the patients cannot really be considered elderly.

## Supportive data

Studies C208 and C215 were originally designed to provide darunavir+ rtv to patients who previously participated in trials with darunavir, and to provide data on the efficacy and safety of darunavir+ rtv treatment. These trials were changed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of darunavir+ rtv (600/100 mg b.i.d.) compared to control up to 48 weeks. Due to the small number of patients in trial TMC114-C208, data from the 2 trials were combined by the applicant resulting in 3 independent groups of patients for analysis

- De novo (N=327): patients starting treatment directly with the recommended dose
- Control/darunavir (N=59): patients who were randomised to control in the original trials but who were subsequently treated with any darunavir+ rtv dose other than the recommended dose.
- Darunavir/darunavir (N=74): patients who failed on darunavir and rolled-over from any darunavir dose in the preceding trials to the recommended dose.

At the time of submission of the application only summary efficacy data were available but the data on 327 patients who were included in the de novo group in C215/C208, and reached Week 24 and 48 or discontinued earlier (data up to May 2006) were subsequently provided.

Comparison of the de novo group with patients initially randomised to the darunavir+ rtv 600 mg b.i.d. group in trials C202 and C213 suggested similarity in terms of demographics and previous  ARV  experience,  with  the  exception  that  more  patients  had  used  tipranavir previously in C215/C208 (31.5%) compared to C202 (5%) or C213 (3.1%). In the de novo group 98.5% of the patients had been pre-treated with ≥ 1 NNRTI. The percentage of patients with 3 or more primary PI mutations at baseline (based on the March 2005 IAS-USA list 28) was &gt;70%. Overall, the median number of primary PI mutations was 3, with a range of 0 to 6 and the median number of PI resistance-associated mutations was 9, with a range of 0 to 13. The median FC in the de novo group was 3.2 for darunavir and 2.6 for tipranavir. The FC for other PIs was higher (all &gt; 20), reflecting the degree of treatment experience of the subjects in these trials. Results of these studies are presented in table 22.

In  the  original  submission,  the  subset  of  patients  who  had  previously  received  tipranavir (TPV), lopinavir (LPV) and amprenavir (APV) was analysed The Antivirogram data revealed that  prior  experience  with  these  PIs  resulted  in  loss  of  susceptibility,  defined  as  a  FC  &gt;  3, FC&gt;10 and FC&gt; 2.5 for TPV, LPV and APV respectively.

- In patients from the de novo group of trials TMC114-C202, TMC114-C213 and TMC114C215/C208 who were resistant to TPV, the median darunavir FC increased to 7.4; thus, the majority  of  the  patients  resistant  to  TPV  had  a  darunavir  FC  &lt;  10.    In  patients  who  were failing TPV/RTV at screening, the darunavir median FC was 3.6.

Darunavir  retained  antiviral  activity  in  most  of  the  patients  who  had  previously  used TPV/RTV, where the observed decrease in viral load at Week 24 was -1.40 log10 copies/ml. In the patients who switched from TPV/RTV to darunavir+ rtv (used TPV at screening), the decrease  in  HIV-1  RNA  was  observed  to  be  -1.64  log10  copies/ml;  thus,  darunavir+  rtv demonstrates  significant  added  antiviral  activity  to  that  of  TPV/RTV.  Although  TPV resistance  at  baseline  was  also  associated  with  an  increase  in  darunavir  FC,  the  observed change in viral load was still -1.38 log10 copies/ml at Week 24.

-  The  majority  of  patients  (392;  86%)  enrolled  in  TMC114-C202,  TMC114-C213  and TMC114-C215/C208 that were in initially randomised to the darunavir+ rtv 600/100 mg b.i.d. groups had used LPV before. Patients who were resistant to LPV, the median darunavir FC was 4.30; thus, the majority of the patients resistant to LPV had a darunavir FC &lt; 10.

Darunavir+ rtv retained antiviral activity in most of the patients who had previously received LPV/RTV, where the observed decrease in viral load at Week 24 was -1.7 log10 copies/ml. The  virologic  response  to  darunavir+  rtv  was  consistent  in  patients  who  switched  from LPV/RTV to darunavir+ rtv (used LPV at screening) and in patients with resistance to LPV at baseline.

-Previous use of APV did not impact in vitro susceptibility of darunavir as the median FC of darunavir was 6.3 for patients who previously used APV in the novo group. The mean change in viral load at Week 24 (NC=F) amounted to -1.51.

N = Total number of subjects; n = number of subjects with virologic response.

Results do not suggest any adverse impact of the co-infection on the virological response rate to darunavir but the number of co-infected patients are small.

The efficacy of darunavir with low dose of ritonavir has not been yet studied in patients under 18 years of age but the applicant provided the protocol of a study the results of which will be submitted as part of the follow up measures to be fulfilled post-authorisation.

The efficacy of darunavir with low dose of ritonavir has not been yet established in treatmentnaïve  HIV-1  infected  patients.  A  controlled  phase  III  trials  is  currently  ongoing  in  this population  (darunavir  +  rtv  regimen:  800/100 mg  q.d.)  against  a  fixed  PI  comparator lopinavir/RTV.

## Clinical safety

The  clinical  safety  database  derived  from  several  studies  in  healthy  subjects  and  in  HIV infected patients. The safety data of darunavir 600 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily are limited to the analyses of data from 2 ongoing phase IIb trials (C202, C213), complemented by  data  of  de  novo  patients  from  2  open-label  trials  (C215/C208).  A  total  of  810  patients received treatment with the recommended dose of darunavir+ rtv 600/100 mg b.i.d.:

- 458 patients started immediately on the recommended dose, this included 327 patients who were treated with the formulation to be marketed (de novo group);
-  352  patients  switched  from  a  lower  dose  to  darunavir+  rtv  600/100  mg  b.i.d.  (switched group).

Darunavir  being  a  protease  inhibitor,  the  safety  profile  was  assessed  during  the  clinical studies, considering some of the abnormalities known with this class.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the initial submission the applicant focussed on the 458 patients who initiated therapy with the  recommended  dose  in  these  trials  (de  novo  patients  i.e.,  who  had  never  received darunavir+rtv at any dose before). An overall safety analysis of the principal adverse event (AE) and laboratory safety findings was subsequently provided based on the pooled analysis of safety data obtained with any dose of darunavir+rtv in trials C202, C213, C215/C208.

## Adverse events

The testing of darunavir alone or in combination with low-dose ritonavir in healthy subjects did not reveal special concerns.  However, in many of the trials and the interaction trials the dose used was generally lower than the recommended dose.

The  most  commonly  reported  AEs  were  headache  and  gastrointestinal  (GI)  disorders.    In addition,  skin  and  subcutaneous  disorders  (including  rash-related  AEs)  and  AEs  related  to bilirubin  abnormalities  were  commonly  reported  after  repeated  dosing  of  darunavir  alone. Rash-related AEs led to permanent treatment discontinuation in 30% (13) of subjects during treatment  with  darunavir  alone  compared  to  2%  (5)  of  subjects  during  treatment  with darunavir + rtv.

A phase I specifically designed to evaluate the effect of darunavir+ rtv on ECG parameters, using higher doses (800/100 mg b.i.d. and 1600/100 mg q.d.), did not evidence any impact on QTc prolongation. However, there were small increases in QTc and PR intervals compared to placebo for which the clinical relevance is unknown.

In the dose-finding part of the phase II trials, the small numbers of tested patients revealed no clear relationship with darunavir+ rtv dose (or pharmacokinetics).

## Pooled data from C202 and C213

Data were provided for 637 patients up to the time of switch or up to the cut-off of September 2005 (see tables 25 and 26).

The majority of AEs (92%) were grade 1 to 2 in severity. The profile of grade 3 or 4 AEs was similar for the different darunavir + rtv groups and was similar to that in the control group. Immune  reconstitution  syndrome  was  reported  in  three  patients  and  was  a  SAE  in  one  of these. Injection site reactions were associated with use of enfuvirtide.

The incidence of rash-related AEs was 8% in darunavir + rtv and control groups while the incidence of rash-related AEs per 100 patient years of exposure was lower with darunavir + rtv (8.1; control: 13.3) and there was no apparent relationship with darunavir dose. The single case considered to be a SAE and leading to discontinuation of darunavir + rtv was a toxic skin eruption considered grade 3 and probably related to treatment by the investigator. Apart from this case and one case of grade 3 erythema multiforme on darunavir + rtv, which also led to discontinuation and was considered possibly drug-related, all rash-related AEs were grade 1 or 2.

## Pooled data from all dosing at 600/100 mg b.i.d. in C202, C213 and C215/208

The  number  of  patients  totalled  810  but  the  duration  of  exposure  to  this  dose  was  very variable due to the different potential origins of the patients.

Treatment discontinuation due to AEs was infrequent: 4% in the 600/100 mg b.i.d. de novo group and 5% in the control group.

Treatment-emergent AEs in &gt; 10% during treatment with 600/100 mg b.i.d. are displayed in table  28.  The  incidence  of  AEs  was  lower  for  those  who  switched  from  a  lower  dose  of darunavir+  rtv  to  the  recommended  dose  than  seen  in  the de  novo patients.  Incidences  of nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, herpes simplex, headache and pyrexia tended to decrease over time.

Safety data in patients who switched darunavir dose and/or formulation did not reveal a clear relationship  between  before  and  after  the  switch.  However,  headache  and  GI  events  were more commonly reported after switch in the lower dose groups, compared to the higher dose groups.  There  appeared  to  be  no  relationship  between  safety  parameters  and  darunavir formulation.  The  safety  profiles  before  and  after  the  switch  to  the  commercial  darunavir formulation  (F016)-  in  patients  previously  exposed  to  various  doses  of  the  clinical  trial formulations- seemed to be consistent with each other.

The safety profile in the novo group was similar to that of PIs within the tested control group receiving OBR.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

The  applicant  gave  additional  overall  overview  of  the  principal  AE  and  laboratory  safety findings of the overall pooled analysis of safety data obtained with any dose of darunavir+ rtv in trials C202, C213, C215 and C208. This analysis included 924 patients in darunavir/ritonavir versus 124 in the control group and the mean duration of treatment for this group  was  considerably  shorter  than  for  the  total  darunavir+  rtv  group  (31.5  versus  46.6 weeks) due to a high attrition rate in the control group of trials C202 and C213.The findings of this overall safety analysis are consistent with the overall safety profile of darunavir+ rtv based  on the  pooled  analysis  of  safety  data  from  patients  who  initiated  treatment  with  the recommended dose of darunavir+ rtv 600/100 mg b.i.d. in these trials initially presented.

In total, 25 deaths after treatment with any dose of darunavir/ritonavir (924) were reported. Overall mortality rate was 3.0 patients per 100 patient years exposure vs. 1.3 patients per 100 patient years exposure in the control group. However, the control group consisted only of a

45/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

small number of patients (124) and there was a high frequency of early dropouts for virologic failure.  In  the  darunavir  groups,  all  deaths,  except  from  3  cases,  occurred  after  at  least  18 weeks  of  treatment.  None  of  these  deaths  were  considered  at  least  possibly  related  to darunavir + rtv treatment. Most cases (16 of 25, 64%) occurred in patients with advanced HIV disease (with baseline CD4+ cell count below 50 x 10 6 cells/l).  The data are reassuring but any future case with fatal outcome will be discussed in PSURs.

Overall,  15% of the patients in  the  600/100  mg  b.i.d.  de  novo  group  reported  SAEs.  Most types of SAEs occurred at isolated cases. The most common SAE was pneumonia but this occurred in only 1 % in the de novo group. Discontinuations due to AEs were infrequent (4% in the 600/100 mg b.i.d. de novo group; 5% control).

The incidence of AEs of special interest for HIV patients using PI containing ART regimens was generally low, mostly grade 1 or 2 in severity. The most common grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased white blood cells count (7% in the 600/100 mg b.i.d. de novo group), and increased triglycerides (9%), amylase (7%), and total cholesterol (5%).

No SAE of hepatotoxicity was observed in the dose-finding studies. Abnormalities in liver function tests were mainly observed for AST and ALT. Graded increases in AST and ALT were  observed  in  23%  and  21%  of  the  patients  in  the  600/100  mg  b.i.d.  de  novo  group, respectively. Most graded individual liver abnormalities were grade 1 or 2 in severity. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 increases in ALT and AST was low (2%); and the mean values for AST  and  ALT  decreased  overtime.  Liver  abnormalities  observed  with  darunavir/ritonavir were generally mild or moderate, and similar or lower to that observed in patients receiving commercially available PIs (excluding tipranavir) in the control group. There was also 1 case of grade 4 hepatotoxicity 12 days after the start of treatment with darunavir+ rtv 600/100 mg b.i.d. in the short-term Phase IIa trials. A liver biopsy showed a histologic image compatible with an acute hepatitis of medicamentous origin. The subject discontinued the trial during the follow-up period and the SAE resolved without sequelae.

Hyperglycaemia and exacerbation of existing diabetes mellitus have been reported in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors. Hyperglycaemia (18%, grades 1 to 3) in patients treated with the recommended dose (de novo group) occurred with a similar incidence compared to control.

The incidence of cardiac-related AEs was 6% in patients treated with the recommended dose de novo and 6% in control patients.  The most common cardiac-related AE preferred term was abnormal ECG (2% in the 600/100 mg b.i.d. de novo group and control). All other AEs were reported by less than 1% of the patients.

Fat distribution and metabolic disorders have been reported with ART. AEs related to lipids occurred  in  8%  in  the  600/100  mg  b.i.d.  de  novo  group  and  in  9%  of  controls  and  mostly concerned hypertriglyceridaemia (6% in the de novo group). The proportions of patients who met the criteria for intervention with respect to blood lipids at baseline were 18% and 19% in respective groups. In the subgroup who did not receive lipid lowering agents, the proportions qualifying for treatment at Weeks 12 and 24 were lower in the de novo group compared to controls (7% vs 16% and 5% vs 12%). There were 19 (4%) with a grade 3 or 4 lipid-related AE during treatment with the 600/100 mg b.i.d. None of the lipid-related AEs was considered serious or caused discontinuation.

With respect to bilirubin abnormalities, in the pooled multiple-dose Phase I trials in HIV-1 negative  subjects,  blood  bilirubin  increased  and  hyperbilirubinemia  were  reported  in  22 (5.8%) and 21 (5.6%) subjects, respectively. Their incidence was higher during treatment with darunavir  alone  (each  in  5  subjects)  than  during  treatment  with  darunavir+  rtv  (in  1  and  0 subjects, respectively).

46/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Increased blood bilirubin and hyperbilirubinemia were also observed during treatment with darunavir+ rtv  +  coadministered  products  (17  and  15  subjects,  respectively),  and  treatment with  coadministered  product  alone  (13  and  4  subjects,  respectively),  primarily  during treatments that included indinavir, lopinavir/rtv, and atazanavir.

Diabetes mellitus/hyperglycaemia have been reported with ART including PI. The incidence of  glucose-related  AEs  was  lower  in  the  600/100  mg  b.i.d.  de  novo  group  (2%)  than  in controls (6%) and most involved hyperglycaemia. Three patients had grade 3 or 4 AEs and two with diabetes had SAEs but no patients were discontinued.

During  de  novo  treatment  increases  from  reference  were  seen  in  mean  haematocrit  and haemoglobin as well as in platelet, lymphocyte, RBC, WBC and neutrophil counts. These also increased in the control group except for a decrease in haemoglobin by Week 24. However, graded haematology abnormalities in the de novo group included decreases in WBC count (22%),  neutrophil  count  (22%)  and  lymphocyte  count  (13%)  and  increases  in  PTT  (11%). Respective  percentages  for  the  control  group  were  29%,  27%,  23%  and  7%,  respectively. Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were mainly related to WBC count (6% in the de novo group), neutrophil count (5%) and lymphocyte count (4%).

Immune reconstitution syndrome is a risk of effective ART. Four cases were reported in the dose-finding studies.  Since  there  was  a  difference  in  the  incidence  of  herpes  simplex  virus infections  in  the  darunavir/ritonavir  treatment  group  compared  to  control  (10.8  versus  2.7 events per 100 patient years of exposure) it cannot be excluded that combination ART with darunavir may cause an inflammatory reaction to opportunistic pathogens.

In HIV-1 infected patients, the incidence of rash- and liver-related AEs darunavir tended to be higher in men than in women while the incidence of cardiac-related AEs was slightly higher in  women.  None  of  these  differences  were  considered  to  be  clinically  relevant.  Darunavir contains  a  sulfonamide  moiety,  and  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  its  sulfonamide  moiety contributes to rash. Subjects in clinical trials with darunavir have therefore been monitored for signs and symptoms of rash. In the total population of the Phase IIb trials, the incidence of rash was comparable for darunavir+ rtv patients with or without documented sulphonamide allergy (8.1% versus 7.2%). Most events did not lead to permanent discontinuation, hence no new investigations into the etiology and/or mechanism of rash were pursued.

A few cases of pancreatitis grade 3 or 4 have been observed. Increases in pancreatic amylase were reported in 28% of the 458 subjects who initiated treatment on the recommended dose 600/100  mg  b.i.d.  in  trials  C202,  C213,  and  C215/C208,  while  increases  in  lipase  were reported in 14% of these subjects. In the control group of trials TMC114-C202 and TMC114C213, the incidence of increased amylase was 27% and the incidence of increased lipase was 9%.  The  incidence  of  grade  3  or  4  laboratory  abnormalities  in  pancreatic  amylase  was comparable  between  these  2  groups  (7%  versus  5%  respectively),  while  grade  3  or  4 abnormalities in lipase were more frequently observed in subjects treated with darunavir+ rtv (4% versus 1% respectively). Pancreatitis seems to be a potential risk because in a few cases a possible and doubtful relationship to the trial medication has been mentioned, although they seem to have been resolved after temporary interruption of the trial medication.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Initially there were concerns raised regarding the safety data reported from the Phase I drug interaction studies since these did not employ the final formulation and dose. There are no data from the Phase II studies on the safety of co-administration with NNRTIs, as they were banned  from  the  trials  as  well  as  medications  that  might  be  expected  to  have  a  clinically significant interaction with. The applicant provided nonetheless an analysis of safety in the pooled group of HIV-1 infected subjects who received darunavir+ rtv at any dose in the Phase

47/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

IIb  trials  C202,  C213,  and  C215/C208  (in  total  924  subjects)  according  to  any  potentially interacting concomitant medications. The results did not suggest any specific safety concerns emerged following concomitant administration of darunavir+ rtv and any of the concomitant medications  in  the  studied  population  but  these  should  be  viewed  with  caution  due  to  the small numbers involved.

## Safety in special populations

In  general,  the  overall  safety  profile  did  not  differ  relevantly  or  systematically  for  the subgroups by age, gender, race and region. However, the number patients older than 50 years was rather small (187) and the patients cannot really be considered elderly.

Thirteen percent of darunavir+ rtv-treated subjects and 16% of subjects in the control group had active hepatitis B or C virus coinfection. An additional 2% and 5% had a non-active coinfection. Hepatitis C co-infection was more common than hepatitis B co-infection.

In the group of subjects who initiated treatment with the recommended dose in trials C202, C213, and C215/C208, the incidence of liver-related AEs did not differ in subjects without or with active hepatitis B or C co-infection (6%). Among subjects treated with any darunavir+ rtv dose, there was a higher incidence of liver-related AEs in subjects with active co-infection (13%)  than  in  subjects  without  co-infection  (8%).  This  was  mainly  related  to  a  higher incidence of increased AST, ALT and GGT. The incidence of these AEs was between 5% and 6% in subjects with active hepatitis B or C coinfection and between 2% and 3% in subjects without hepatitis B or C co-infection. The subgroups of subjects with non-active hepatitis B or C co-infection were too small to allow meaningful conclusions.

Similar  to  the  control  group,  the  co-infected  patients  with  hepatitis  B  or  C  had  a  slightly higher  rate  of  liver-related  AEs  (13%)  vs.  all  other  patients  treated  with  darunavir  (8%). Therefore, it is recommended to monitor liver-related AEs according to standard practice in HBV or HCV co-infected patients. This is in line with ART experience in this special group of patients.

Drug exposure to darunavir during pregnancy occurred in four patients and in all cases study medication was stopped immediately. The follow up of the cases reported: 1 induced abortion during  the  first  trimester,  1  continued  taking  ART  (not  darunavir)  foetus  died  due  to intrauterine  asphyxia,  1  gave  birth  a  healthy  term  male  babyand  1  no  information.  The applicant  undertook  to  provide  results  from  the  Antiretroviral  Pregnancy  Register  in  the PSURs.

The  safety  specification  covers  all  the  issues  that  are  considered  relevant  for  the  use  of darunavir  in  clinical  practice.  Within  the  pharmacovigilance  plan,  most  of  the  activities planned  are  routine  pharmacovigilance  practices  with  report  in  the  PSUR  according  to  the normal PSUR schedule, using the International birth date (23 June 2006).

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## 6. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Darunavir is a protease inhibitor with potent activity against wild type HIV-1 and PI resistant HIV.  Darunavir  showed  antiviral  activity  against  laboratory  strains  and  clinical  isolate compatible with clinical use for the treatment of HIV.

The pharmacokinetics of darunavir has been adequately studied but low systemic exposures compared  to  the  intended  human  exposure  were  achieved  in  all  species,  consequently  the margin of safety derived from animal studies is absent or low.

In  chronic  toxicity  studies,  the  key  target  organs/systems  identified  in  rodents  were  the haematopoietic  system,  the  blood  coagulation  system,  liver  and  thyroid.  A  variable  but limited decrease in red blood cell-related parameters was observed, together with increases in activated partial thromboplastin time. Changes were observed in liver (hepatocyte hypertrophy,  vacuolation,  increased  liver  enzymes)  and  thyroid  (follicular  hypertrophy).  In the  dog,  no  major  toxicity  findings  or  target  organs  were  identified.  The  safety  margin  for darunavir, expressed on the basis of Cmax and AUC, was close to or less than one. In juvenile rats, there were deaths at the lowest dose, while the same was not observed in adult rats even at  the  highest  dose.  Exposure  was  much  higher  in  juvenile  rats  than  what  was  observed  in adult rats. Further studies are planned in juvenile rats, the results of which will be provided post-authorisation.

Darunavir did not impact on mating or fertility in rats at exposure levels below (AUC - 0.5 fold) of that in human at the clinically recommended dose. The number of corpora lutea  and  implantations  were  decreased  in  the  presence  of  maternal  toxicity.  There  was  no teratogenicity with darunavir in rats and rabbits when treated alone nor in mice when treated in combination  with  ritonavir. The  exposure  levels were  lower  than  those with the recommended clinical  dose  in  humans.  In  a  pre-  and  postnatal  development  assessment  in rats, darunavir with and without ritonavir, caused a transient reduction in body weight gain of the  offspring  pre-weaning  and  there  was  a  slight  delay  in  the  opening  of  eyes  and  ears. Darunavir  in  combination  with  ritonavir  caused  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  pups  that exhibited  the  startle  response  on  day  15  of  lactation  and  a  reduced  pup  survival  during lactation.  These  effects  may  be  secondary  to  pup  exposure  to  the  drug  via  the  milk  and/or maternal  toxicity.  No  post  weaning  functions  were  affected  with  darunavir  alone  or  in combination with ritonavir.

Considering these data and the lack of data in humans, darunavir + rtv should not be used in pregnant women unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Considering that darunavir is excreted

50/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in rats milk and in the absence of human data, darunavir + rtv should not be used during pregnancy.

Darunavir was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests. The lack of final results from the carcinogenicity  studies  was  addressed  and  in  accordance  with  the  CHMP  on  the  need  for Carcinogenicity  Studies  of  Pharmaceuticals  (CPMP/ICH/140/95),  and  draft  Guideline  on Carcinogenicity  Evaluation  of  Medicinal  Products  for  the  Treatment  of  HIV  Infection EMEA/194898/2006 , because darunavir is intended for the treatment of patients with limited treatment options, the CHMP considered a marketing authorisation could be granted prior the availability  of  these  results.  However  the  applicant  undertook  to  submit  the  final  results  as part of the follow-up measures to be fulfilled post-authorisation.

There was no evidence of immunotoxicity or antigenicity associated with darunavir.

The applicant performed an environmental risk assessment. Results from ongoing studies will be provided as part of the follow-up measures to be fulfilled post-authorisation.

The salient findings from the preclinical studies have been reflected in the SPC.

## Efficacy

The pharmacokinetics profile of darunavir co-administered with ritonavir has been defined in healthy volunteers as well as in HIV-1 infected patients. Overall exposure of darunavir (600 mg bid) was increased by approximately 14-fold when co-administered with ritonavir (100 mg bid). When darunavir (tablet formulation) is administered with ritonavir, food increased bioavailability by about 30%. Therefore darunavir should be taken with food, as used in the clinical trials and recommended in the SPC.

The  pharmacokinetics  profile  of  darunavir  has  not  yet  been  assessed  in  children  and adolescents  and  only  preliminary  data  are  available  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment. Waiting for the final results of this study, no dose adjustments are recommended for darunavir or ritonavir in mild and moderate hepatic impaired patients. In the absence of data, darunavir is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Considering that the elimination of darunavir via the renal route is minimal, no impact of the impairment of the renal function is  anticipated  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  darunavir.  No  dose  adjustment  is  therefore recommended in patients with renal impairment. There are only limited data in elderly and therefore darunavir+rtv should be used with caution in this population.

Darunavir exposure was higher in HIV-infected patients compared to healthy volunteers. The population pharmacokinetic analyses suggested that the higher α 1-acid glycoprotein levels in HIV infected subjects compared to healthy subjects could partly explain this difference.

The  relevant  pharmacokinetics  data,  and  recommendations,  have  been  reflected  in  the Summary of Product Characteristics.

In vitro studies showed that darunavir is mainly a substrate for CYP3A4, and also substrate for P-gp. Darunavir may also have the potential to inhibit P-gp. Darunavir inhibited CYP3A at clinical relevant plasma concentrations. Darunavir appeared also to induce CYP enzymes. In  vivo  interactions  with  medicinal  products  that  induce  or  are  metabolise  by  CYP  P450 isoenzymes activity are likely to be extensive. The applicant completed a number of studies nonetheless  almost  all  of  them  used  doses  of  darunavir  lower  than  the  recommended  dose (darunavir+ rtv 400/100 mg b.i.d. and some with 300/100 mg b.i.d. in the fed state instead of the recommended dose of 600/100 mg) and/or formulation less bioavailable than the final one to be marketed. The commercial tablet formulation showed about 21% increase in exposure compared to some clinical trial formulations. The observed interactions are in line with those observed for other PIs given with low-dose ritonavir but due to the limitations of the studies, the effects may be underestimated. In addition because darunavir binds predominantly to α 1glycoprotein, protein displacement of medicinal products highly bound to that protein cannot be ruled out. All the relevant information on interactions and adequate warnings have been reflected in the SPC, including recommendation for clinical monitoring of safety if necessary. The  applicant  undertook  to  provide  additional  data  to  further  characterise  the  interaction

profile of darunavir as part of specific obligations and follow-up measures to be fulfilled postauthorisation.

The 600/100 mg dose is the recommended dose for treatment of HIV infected subjects. Dose rationale  is  mainly  based  upon  the  virological  responses  observed  in  the  two  dose-finding studies  (see  below)  and  the  fact  that  a  less  than  dose  proportional  increase  in  exposure  is observed over the 400/100 and 600/100 b.i.d. dose range.

The resistance profile of darunavir was studied in vitro and in vivo .  Based on the data from Phase IIb studies, susceptibility to darunavir was correlated with both the type and number of protease  mutations.  Mutations  at  V32I,  L33F,  I47V,  I54L  and  L89V  developed  in  viruses from at least 10% of the patients with virological failure (never reaching &gt;1.0 log10 decrease or rebound from a &gt;1.0 log 10 decrease). Mutations at V32I and I54L were the most common mutations  that  developed  in  &gt;  20%  of  the  virological  failures.  The  applicant  undertook  to provide additional data on the emergent of resistant strains and on cross-resistance as part of the follow-up measures to be fulfilled post-authorisation.

The demonstration of the clinical efficacy of darunavir is based on the primary week-24 analyses of virological response from 2 controlled dose range finding Phase II trials (studies C202 and C213 also known as Power 1 and 2) in which darunavir co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir plus an optimised background regimen (OBR) was compared to a control group receiving an investigator-selected PI(s) regimen plus an OBR. These randomised, controlled trials consisted of an initial dose-finding part and a second long-term part in which all patients randomised to darunavir + 100 mg ritonavir received the recommended dose of 600/100 mg b.i.d. The protocols of these studies were amended (including the primary endpoint) to become pivotal. HIV-1 infected patients who were eligible for these trials had previously failed more than 1 PI containing regimen. The OBR consisted of at least 2 NRTIs with or without enfuvirtide (ENF). Patients were treatmentexperienced (average time since HIV-1 infection diagnosis was 13.2 years in C202 versus 11.6 years in C213; 71% of the patients in the C202 trial and 63% of patients in the C213 trial were infected with virus resistant to all commercially available PIs at the time of the trials; the median CD4 + cell count at baseline was 106 in the C202 trial versus 179 x 10 6 cells/ml the C213 trial).

In the pooled analysis, patients treated with darunavir+ rtv at the recommended dose 600/100 mg b.i.d. (n=131) had significantly higher virological response rates  (defined as at least 1.0 log10 decrease in viral load versus baseline at week 24) than the control group (70 % versus 21 %). In both trials,  results  obtained  for  the  other  virologic  response  categories  (defined  as  a decrease of viral load by at least 0.5 log10 relative to baseline, or proportion of patients with a viral load &lt; 400 or &lt; 50 copies/ml) confirmed the findings of the primary efficacy parameter. At 24 weeks, for instance, the percentage of patients with viral load &lt; 50 HIV RNA copies/ml were 45% (59/131) in the darunavir + ritonavir group versus 12 % (15/124) in the control group. For patients reaching week-48 or discontinued earlier, the 48-week analysis indicates that proportions of patients with at least 1 log drop decrease over time (from 69% to 61%); however,  the  same  percentage  of  patients  were  undetectable  (&lt; 50 HIV RNA  copies/ml)  at week-24  and  week-48  respectively  (45%).  The  limitations  in  the  design  of  the  proof  of principles  studies  were  not  considered per  se major  in  the  light  of  the  demonstrated favourable efficacy results.

In addition, results from the open-label trials C208/C215 (POWER 3) using similar inclusion and  evaluation  criteria  as  in  the  controlled  trials  enrolled  patients  who  were  even  more advanced  (with  median  CD4+:  115  x  10 6 cells/l  and  virologically  patients  had  median  3 primary PI mutations, 9 resistance  associated  mutations)  than  those  enrolled  in  trials  C202 and  C213  were  provided.  Thirty  two  percent  of these  patients  had  also  failed  the  most recently approved PI tipranavir. In the group of patients who started directly treatment with the recommended dose of darunavir + ritonavir , virological response rate defined as at least 1.0  log 10 decrease  in  viral  load  versus  baseline  at  week  24  accounted  for  65  %  (160/246).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Additional data supported the 24 week efficacy profile of darunavir+ rtv (in 327 patients) at the  recommended dose with the to be marketed formulation. The provided week 48 results suggest that the virological response is sustained within the observed follow-up period.

In a limited numbers of hepatitis B or C co-infected patients, the virological response rate to darunavir does not appear affected.

The efficacy of darunavir has not been established in children and adolescents nor in HIVinfected treatment naïve patients.

## Safety

The data on clinical safety of darunavir 600 mg co-administered with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily are mainly based on the analyses of data from 2 ongoing phase IIb trials (C202, C213), complemented by data of de novo patients from 2 open-label trials (C215/C208). The safety database,  especially  with  regard  to  the  final  recommended  regimen  and  formulation, comprises therefore a limited number of patients.

The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  reactions  of  any  grade  were  diarrhoea,  nausea,  and headache . Protease inhibitors class related events were prospectively looked at (e.g cardiac related,  lipid-related,  liver-related  and  glucose  related  adverse  events).  So  far  the  safety profile  seems  consistent  with  other  PI.  Nonetheless  the  lack  for  head  to  head  comparative phase III studies versus comparators in similar therapeutic indications precludes a definitive conclusion related to the safety profile of darunavir compared to other PIs.

In  the  total  population  of  the  Phase  IIb  trials,  the  incidence  of  rash  was  comparable  for darunavir/rtv patients with or without documented sulphonamide allergy (8.1% versus 7.2%). There  was  no  apparent  relationship  with  darunavir  dose.  Discontinuation  due  to  adverse reaction  were  infrequent.  There  was  one  case  of  SAE  (toxic  skin  eruption)  leading  to discontinuation  of  darunavir  +  rtv.  In  the  patients  who  switched  from  the  clinical  trial formulation to the commercial formulation there did not seem to be an increased risk of AEs

Because patients were not necessarily taking potentially interacting medicinal products during the clinical studies (for instance NNRTIs were excluded), the safety data obtained may not be wholly applicable to the more general use of darunavir.

As  expected  for  antiretrovirals,  patients  co-infected  with  hepatitis  B  or  C  can  have  an increased frequency of treatment-emergent liver function abnormalities but the limited control data do not allow assessment of any differences between the darunavir and control groups. The standard antiretroviral warning and monitoring labelling text have been included in the SPC.

There is a need to further characterise the safety profile. This has been addressed in the risk management  plan  and  final  results  from  ongoing  studies  will  be  submitted  as  part  of  the follow-up measures to be fulfilled post-authorisation. From the safety database all the adverse reactions have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately address these.

## Risk-benefit assessment

The available efficacy data from the controlled Phase IIb trials C202 (POWER 1) and C213 (POWER 2) on darunavir + rtv at the recommended dose 600/100 mg b.i.d. in the targeted heavily pre-treated HIV-1 infected (with multi-PI resistance) patient population (n=131) support the conclusion that it is adequately efficacious. In addition, the open trial C215/C208 (POWER 3) using similar inclusion and evaluation criteria as in the controlled trials enrolled

53/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients in 327 patients who were even more advanced confirms the 24  week efficacy profile of darunavir+rtv at the recommended dose with the to be marketed formulation. The provided week 48 versus week 24 results suggest that the virological response is sustained within the observed follow-up period.

The present safety data on darunavir+rtv do not suggest a safety profile which would preclude approval of darunavir. The safety database with the recommended dose and the formulation to be marketed is still limited. Therefore, the data obtained may not be wholly applicable to the more general use of darunavir. In addition there are limitations in the available interaction data and some effects may be underestimated hence additional monitoring may be warranted as recommended in the SPC.

Overall, the data presented support a clinical benefit for darunavir in combination with low dose ritonavir in the treatment of HIV-1 infected highly pre-treated adult patients who failed more than one regimen containing a protease inhibitor (PI). Taking into account the observed safety profile, the risk-benefit of darunavir in the sought indication is considered positive. However, there are insufficient comprehensive clinical data available in particular regarding safety data for the optimal use of boosted darunavir in the targeted population in  clinical practice.  The CHMP reviewed the request from the applicant for a conditional marketing authorisation, and considered, that the PREZISTA (darunavir) falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, with particular reference to Article 2, based on the following grounds:

PREZISTA is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in highly pre-treated adult patients who failed more than one regimen containing a protease inhibitor. Thus, PREZISTA is a medicinal product, which aims at the treatment of a seriously debilitating and lifethreatening disease.

The CHMP considered, that PREZISTA fulfils the requirements of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 based on the following grounds:

- (a) The clinical benefit of darunavir has been demonstrated. This is based on evidence from two randomised, controlled studies comparing the safety and efficacy of darunavir + low dose ritonavir with other ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor combinations. Patients in both arms of these trials also used other anti-HIV agents (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) with or without enfuvirtide. In these studies, patients on the recommended dose of darunavir + ritonavir experienced higher rates of reduction of their HIV viral load than patients on other ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor combinations (70 % versus 21 % achieved virological response defined as at least 1.0 log10 decrease in viral load versus baseline at week 24). The used objective laboratory endpoint of plasma HIV RNA and derived efficacy parameters such as change in HIV RNA from baseline, ≥ 0.5 log10 decrease from baseline, ≥ 1 log10 decrease from baseline, and proportions of patients with viral load  &lt; 400 or &lt; 50 copies/ml are all reliable virological outcome measures for the sought target HIV-1 infected population. Additional data from the open-label trial support the efficacy of darunavir with low dose ritonavir with evidence of sustained responses within the observed follow-up period.

The safety profile was considered acceptable. The limited database is nonetheless recognised and supplementary safety data in a controlled fashion derived from randomised controlled Phase III trials are necessary.

Therefore based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered that the risk-benefit balance of PREZISTA as defined in Article 1(28a) of Directive 2001/83/EC, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in highly pre-treated adult patients who failed more than one regimen containing a protease inhibitor, was positive.

b) The CHMP considers that the following data will provide comprehensive clinical data:

- -the final study reports from the studies POWER 1, 2 and 3
- -the final study report from the ongoing study C214 (randomised, controlled, open-label trial  to  compare  the  efficacy,  safety  and  tolerability  of  darunavir  with  low  dose  of ritonavir versus lopinavir/ritonavir in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected subjects)

54/56

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -the final study reports from the ongoing interaction studies with rifabutin and didanosine as well as  an analysis assessing the effect of coadministered nevirapine and efavirenz on darunavir from study C214 ; in addition estimation of intra-subject variability.
- -the  data  from  the  darunavir  treatment  arm  that  do  not  receive  the  candidate  NNRTI (TMC125) for the two following studies:

-study C206: Phase III randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the   efficacy, tolerability and safety of TMC125 as part of an ART including darunavir with low dose ritonavir and an investigator-selected OBR in HIV-1 infected subjects with limited to no treatment options.

- study C216: Phase III randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of TMC125 as part of an ART including darunavir with low dose ritonavir and an investigator-selected OBR in HIV-1 infected subjects with limited to no treatment options. T

- -study C208:  open label trial of darunavir with low dose of ritonavir in HIV-1 infected subjects who were randomised in the trials C201, C207 or in sponsor selected Phase I trials
- -study C209: open-label safety study of darunavir in combination with low dose RTV and other ARVs in highly experienced HIV-1 infected patients with limited or no treatment options

These ongoing clinical trials using darunavir+rtv at the presently recommended dose will provide comprehensive clinical data for the optimal use of boosted darunavir in the targeted population. Because these studies are ongoing the CHMP considers that it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data.

The design of the studies in heavily pre-treated patients using an investigational NNRTI (trials C206 and C216) is as such that they can generate only supportive data for safety of PREZISTA. They are not designed as confirmatory Phase III trials for PREZISTA.

(c) No satisfactory methods of treatment that have been authorised, or exist in the Community for patients with advanced disease and limited to no remaining treatment options. Despite other agents that have shown activity in this setting, such as tipranavir, there remains a large unmet medical need in the treatment of this patients population.

Based on the available data, the CHMP considers that darunavir with low dose of ritonavir will be a component of combination antiretroviral therapy for patients with advanced disease and limited to no remaining treatment options, thus addressing the unmet medical need.

(d)  New  treatments  having  an  effect  in  terms  of  relevant  endpoints  are  of  immediate relevance to patients with advanced disease and limited to no remaining treatment options. Although  comprehensive  data  are  not  available  to  allow  to  precise  the  optimal  use  of darunavir with low dose ritonavir in the targeted population, in view of the efficacy of the product and the poor prognosis, lack of comprehensive data poses no risks that outweigh the benefits.  Therefore  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  benefit  to  public  health  of  the  immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.

In addition to the specific obligations, the applicant undertook to provide additional data as part of follow-up measures to be fulfilled post-authorisation including (cross)-resistance data, interaction data, data in patients with hepatic impairment, in children and adolescents and in HIV-infected treatment-naive patients.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns. No

additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

Due to the nature of the disease, darunavir + ritonavir treatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of PREZISTA  was  favourable  and  therefore recommended  the  granting  of  the  conditional  marketing  authorisation  in  the  following indication:

PREZISTA, co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in highly pre-treated adult patients who failed more than one regimen containing a protease inhibitor (PI).

This indication is based on week-24 analyses of virological and immunological response from 2 controlled dose range finding Phase II trials and additional data from uncontrolled studies ( see section 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characterisitcs ). In deciding to initiate treatment with PREZISTA co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir careful consideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of mutations associated with different agents. Genotypic or phenotypic testing (when available) and treatment history should guide the use of PREZISTA.
