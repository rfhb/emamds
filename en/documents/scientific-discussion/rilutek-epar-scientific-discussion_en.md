## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval of RILUTEK. This scientific discussion has been updated until 1 January 2004. For information on changes after this date please refer to module 8B.

## 1. Introduction

Rilutek tablets contain riluzole, a new chemical entity of the benzothiazole class. Riluzole is indicated for the treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The indication is based on data derived  from  two  pivotal  clinical  trials  in  which  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  riluzole  induces  a modest extension of the life of patients with ALS regardless of the onset type. The claimed indication for this  medicinal product is :'To extend life or the time to mechanical ventilation for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\".

ALS is a progressive degenerative disorder of motor neurons and motor cortex. The symptoms of ALS are  characterised  by  a  progressive  and  irreversible  decrease  of  muscle  strength.  The  following definition of the pathology of ALS is found in the Oxford Textbook of Medicine: 'a disease in which degeneration  affects  motor  neurons  in  the  anterior  horns  of  the  grey  matter  of  the  spinal  cord,  in certain somatic motor nuclei of the cranial nerves and in the cerebral cortex. There is no inflammatory reaction and  microscopy provides  no  clue to the  cause  of the initially asymmetrical but progressive neuronal loss. As both upper and lower neurons are affected to varying degrees in different patients, the symptomatology is diverse.' The disease has an unremitting course of wasting and weakness and is usually fatal within three years.

Although  the  pathogenesis  of  ALS  is  not  completely  elucidated  and  no  validated  models  exist  in which riluzole may be tested, it is suggested that glutamate (the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the  central  nervous system) plays a role for cell death in the disease. Riluzole is proposed to act by inhibiting glutamate processes. The mode of action is unclear.

## 2. Part II: Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The pharmaceutical data described in Part II of the dossier are summarised below.

## Synthesis:

The  synthesis route comprises  5 steps beginning  with the nitration of the starting material trifluoromethoxybenzene. Control during the first three steps was by a GC method and the fourth and fifth steps by an HPLC (CN reverse phase) method. Satisfactory information has been provided on the in-process control methods and satisfactory specifications are shown to be applied for control of the intermediate products. Satisfactory specifications and details  on the  control tests implemented  were provided  for  the  materials  contributing  to  the  structure  of  the  final  molecule  and  for  the  other reactants, reagents and solvents.

The analytical methods employed (GC, TLC, HPLC) were found to be capable of controlling the drug substance  within  its  design  specification.  Drug  substance  specification  was  controlled  by  testing appearance,  identity,  colour,  melting point,  particle  size  distribution,  water  content,  appearance  and colour of methanolic solution, sulphated ash, heavy metals and related substances assays.

Proof  of  structure  was  provided  by  elemental  analysis,  UV  and  IR  spectroscopy,  EI  and  CI  mass spectrometry  and 1 H  and 13 C  NMR  spectroscopy.  Satisfactory  spectral  interpretations  have  been provided and appear to be consistent with the proposed molecular structure.

The  physicochemical  attributes  of  the  molecule  are  adequately  presented.  The  parameters  studied included  solubility  (in  methanol,  HCl  and  water),  melting  point,  pK,  partition  coefficient  and polymorphism.  X-ray  diffraction  examination  of  5  industrial  batches  showed  no  evidence  of polymorphism.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A  comprehensive  study  on  potential  impurities  is presented.  Impurities  related  to  residual  solvents, related substances  arising from  the synthesis  (including  intermediates  and  secondary  reaction products),  degradation  products  (monitored  by  stress  testing;  heat,  light,  acid,  alkali  and  peroxide stress in organic and aqueous solutions) were addressed adequately. The drug substance was found to be extremely stable, with only two significant degradation products being observed when riluzole was in  solution  in  acetone  and  exposed  to  light.  Degradation  impurities  were  not  found  in  normal conditions. Batch analyses  were performed  on 24 batches  of  material, ranging in size  from 300g to 55.6kg (production scale), used in preclinical and clinical studies. Stability data were generated on 6 batches  of  drug  substance,  3  pilot  and  3  production.  No  deviations  from  initial  values  for  assay  or related substances were observed. The data support the proposed storage period of 24 months before re-test.  Real-time  studies  are  on-going  to  confirm  the  stability  of  the  active  drug  substance  over  24 months.

## Dosage form:

The core of each tablet contains 50 mg of active drug substance and the excipients, anhydrous dibasic calcium  phosphate,  microcrystalline  cellulose,  anhydrous  colloidal  silica,  magnesium  stearate  and croscarmellose sodium. All the excipients used have been shown to comply with the most stringent pharmacopoeial requirements available, primarily with the European Pharmacopoeia.

The  active  drug  substance  was  found  to  have  local  anaesthetic  actions  and  this  necessitated  film coating the product. The core is film coated, comprising hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol 6000, titanium dioxide and purified water.

Three formulations are described. Initial manufacturing development centred around a water/alcohol/povidone wet granulation process (A) which produced a product for use in early clinical studies.  Subsequently  a  move  to  direct  compression  formulations  (B)  based  on  dibasic  calcium phosphate  and  microcrystalline  cellulose  was  made  and  the  third  formulation  is  the  marketing formulation  (C),  which  is  also  produced  by  direct  compression.  The  account  of  the  qualitative  and quantitative  optimisation  of  the  formulation  selected  for  development  appears  convincing  and  the arguments put forward are sound. There was concern over the possible lack of clinical efficacy due to the  differences in Cmax of the formulations B and C in the dose ranging study 301; justification was based on the safety data collected with the 200mg dose in study 301.

Pilot  scale  batches  were  manufactured  using  different  input  batches  of  active  drug  substance  and excipients  to  validate  the  robustness  of  the  formulation  process,  to  identify  the  critical  process parameters  and  to  determine  appropriate  in-process  controls.  Suitable  controls  were  applied  to  the powder blend, the tablet cores and the coated tablets.

In vitro dissolution was not influenced by the particle size. Comparative in vitro dissolution profiles of 3 industrial scale batches (produced at the intended manufacturing site) and two development batches, demonstrated no significant differences in release characteristics.

Validation data were provided on 3 full-scale production batches. Full details are provided on blending conditions, batch identification of input material, compression and coating. Overall it is concluded that the  manufacture  is  sufficiently  robust  to  provide  assurance  that  the  process  produces  tablets  of consistent quality complying with the design specification.

Finished product specification was controlled by testing appearance, colour, identification (HPLC, IR) and assay and related substances (HPLC) of riluzole, identification of titanium dioxide, uniformity of content, dissolution and microbiological quality. The total related substances limit is proposed not more than 0.8%, which is made up of synthetic impurities and potential degradation products.

Satisfactory batch analyses data were provided on 4 full-scale production batches manufactured at the intended production site.

Stability data were generated on 4 pilot batches and 3 production batches of tablets stored in the PVC/aluminium blisters intended for the marketed product. No significant changes from initial values were noted for production scale product stored under all storage conditions. Overall, the product exhibits a good stability profile and the data, as presented supports the proposed shelf life of 24 months. The shelf life was consequently extended to 36 months through a Type I variation. It was agreed that no special storage instructions should apply to Rilutek.

## 3. Part III: Toxico-pharmacological aspects

The preclinical dossier is extensive and complies with GLP standards except for some early studies, which have no major significance for the assessment.

## Pharmacodynamics

Riluzole  has  been  shown  to  cross  the  blood  brain  barrier  and  to  be  active in  various  in  vivo experimental models of neuronal injury involving excitotoxic mechanisms such as cerebral ischemia. Riluzole in vitro protects cultured rat motorneurons from the excitotoxic effects of glutamic acid and prevents  the  death  of  cortical  neurons  induced  by  anoxia.  In  vitro  and  animal  model  studies  have shown  that  riluzole  is  able  to  modify  neurotransmission  mediated  by  glutamate,  particularly  in circumstances where overstimulation of the post-synaptic nerve occurs.

Summarised below is a list of its activities (derived from the primary pharmacological studies) which led to the rationale for progressing this compound to clinical trials:

- Protection  against  neurotoxicity  in  rat  brain  slices  exposed  to  depolarising  agents  acting  at excitatory amino acid receptors.
- Protection against anoxia or glutamate toxicity in cultured motor neurones.
- Protection of rat cortical neurones against toxic factors in CSF from patients with ALS

It  should  be  noted  however  that  there  were  no  validated  animal  models  of  ALS  in  which  to  test Riluzole.

Effects  of  riluzole  unrelated  to  the  desired  use  include  muscle  relaxation  and  sedation  (through depression of CNS activity) in rodents, but not neuroleptic, anxiolytic or psychostimulating activity in usually sensitive models. At 2 mg/kg i.v and above, EEC and sleep patterns were found to be changed. Although the  action  of  riluzole  on  voltage-dependent  sodium  channels  may  have  consequences  on cardiac  function,  no  cardiovascular  effects  of  significance  were  seen  at  3  mg/kg  in  rats.  The  local anaesthetic action observed at &gt; 1mM concentrations could be the result of riluzole's action at these ion channels. Riluzole showed no anticholinergic action and only transient effects on dog respiratory function at doses of 2 mg/kg and above.

Of the 7 metabolites examined, only 2 (the 5-hydroxy- and hydroxylamine compounds) retained some of  the  qualitative  pharmacological properties of riluzole. No new interactions  with  receptor binding sites were found. The maximum concentrations of the metabolites were considered to be too low to be of importance.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetics were studied in the mouse, rat, rabbit, monkey and dog .

The use of radiolabelled riluzole showed that absorption from the GI tract was efficient but variable in all  species.  A  high  oxidative  hepatic  metabolism  was  evidenced  in  all  species,  the  elimination  of metabolites  occurring  mainly through urinary tract. Distribution to body tissues  was extensive,  with CNS concentrating  radioactivity  some  threefold  over  plasma  level  within  1  hour  of  a  single  dose. However, tissue retention was low and by 72 hours after dosing radioactivity was only significant in the organs associated with excretion, plus a small residuum bound to melanin. Repeated administration of radiolabelled riluzole identified thyroid, adrenals, and  skin as retainers of concentrations higher than those of plasma for at least 7 days.

Radioactivity in rat foetuses and milk confirmed the wide distribution property of riluzole. However, kinetics in pregnant animals was not significantly different.

The formation of a ureido metabolite (RP 69597) in monkey (3%) and man (10%) is also mentioned in this dossier although no mention is made whether this metabolite might be a possible cause of adverse effects at levels of riluzole beyond that for the desired activity.

Possible interaction kinetics have been suggested for compounds such as amitryptiline, clomipramine, diazepam and diclofenac, but the in vitro inhibition constants for these substances indicate that in vivo interactions are unlikely to be of clinical importance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Toxicology

## Single dose studies:

Acute toxicity was related to the CNS impact of riluzole. The dose-response relationship indicated a steep slope from mild lethargy, plus effects on respiration and CV function, to lethality.

## Repeated administration studies:

In i.v or oral studies lasting from 14 days to 6 months, the clinical signs of toxicity were attributed to CNS  reactions  resulting  from  the  excessive  inhibition  of  the  transmission  processes,  which  were manifest  as  salivation  and  lack  of  co-ordination  followed  by  sedation,  lethargy,  reduced  activity, prostration and eventual mortality.

Reductions  in  red  blood  cell  parameters  and/or  alterations  in  liver  parameters without  histology impairment  were  noted  in  subacute  and  chronic  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  monkeys.  In  dogs haemolytic anaemia was observed.

In a single toxicity study, the absence of corpora lutea was noted at a higher incidence in the ovary of treated  compared  to  control  female  rats.  This  isolated  finding  was  not  noted  in  any  other  study  or species.

On the basis of toxicology studies, liver, blood and  ovarian  cells can be regarded as three potential target organs.

## Reproductive toxicology:

Doses of 8 mg/kg/day had no adverse effects on reproduction and development in rats although at 15 mg/kg/day (which is higher than the recommended human dose), adverse effects including mortality, loss  of  implantation  in  survivors,  reduced  reproductive  performance  and  fertility  and  toxicity  in offspring during lactation were observed.

## Teratogenicity tests:

Standard  design  teratogenicity  tests  showed  no  evidence  that  riluzole  could  cause  malformation  or malfunction in fetuses of rats or rabbits.

Conventional genotoxicity: in vitro assays; utilising rat liver S9 fraction to model metabolism, gave no evidence of genotoxic potential for riluzole. In vivo assays in rat and mouse also gave no indication of chromosomal damage. There remains the possibility that these models did not generate all metabolites relevant to humans, particularly since no metabolic characterisation of the S9 fraction was conducted.

Carcinogenic potential: Riluzole did not show any carcinogenicity potential in either rats or mice.

Special  toxicity  studies:  Riluzole  has  been  shown  to  induce  haemolytic  anaemia  in  dog.  Various possible mechanisms of action have been investigated, but no alterations were found in different red blood cell parameters (electrolyte content, osmotic fragility etc.).

No haemolytic potential has been shown in vitro on human, monkey, rat and dog erythrocytes.

A bromo derivative, seen as a significant impurity, was not mutagenic in a standard Ames test and not more acutely toxic than riluzole in mice.

Exposure of the environment to Rilutek is not considered to be a concern as judged from the risk assessment supplied.

## Post-authorisation toxico-pharmacological data

At the time of the initial submission in July 1995, RPR112512 (N-hydroxy-riluzole), described as the major  active  metabolite  of  riluzole,  could  not  be  measured in  vivo due  to  chemical  instability  of RPR112512  during  blood  sampling/treatment  and  the  lack  of  a  sensitive  analytical  method.  As appropriate  analytical  methods  and  sampling  conditions  for  RPR112512  were  defined,  additional pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies were conducted to determine the exposure to RPR112512 in the previous preclinical toxicology studies as well as pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies including an extensive battery of genotoxicity assays.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It was concluded that there were no unexpected adverse findings, with the exception of chromosome damage  induced  by  RPR112512  in  the  L5178Y  cell  line  only.  This  is  not  considered  to  have  any significant effect on the risk benefit ratio. All other data suggest RPR112512 presents no greater risk than  that  already  known  for  riluzole.  The  MAH  updated  section  5.3  of  Summary  of  Product Characteristics to include this new information through a Type II variation.

## 4. Part IV: Clinical aspects

## Tolerance and pharmacodynamics studies

Changes were recorded in the EEG spectrum, proving that Riluzole crosses the brain barrier. Although somnolence was the most common dose-dependent CNS side effect observed, Riluzole did not affect the sleep profile. No significant changes in the psychomotor performances were observed in studies carried out on 129 healthy volunteers involved in 7 studies except the vigilance, which was sometimes decreased at high doses.

In  one  study  in  healthy  volunteers,  therapeutic  doses  of  riluzole  reduced  significantly  the  EEG alterations caused by hypobaric hypoxia simulating an altitude of 5000 m. In another study, riluzole had  no effect on  similar  parameters  measured  in  healthy  volunteers  in  a  model  of  hypoxia corresponding  to  an  altitude  of  6000  m.  Riluzole  has  also  been  shown  to  moderately  reduce  the cerebral metabolism of glucose in some regions of the brain as shown by Pet-scan.

## Pharmacokinetics studies

About 350 subjects were enrolled in 16 studies. In most of the studies Riluzole was given via the oral route of administration.

The pharmacokinetics  of  riluzole  have  been  evaluated  in  healthy  male  volunteers  after  single  oral administration of 25 to 300 mg and after multiple-dose oral administration of 25 to 100 mg bid. The pharmacokinetics of riluzole were also studied in healthy elderly, as well as in subjects with impaired renal  or  hepatic  function.  In  healthy  volunteers,  plasma  levels  increase  with  the  dose  and  the pharmacokinetic profile is dose-independent and shows a linear PK behavior.

With  multiple  dose  administration  (10  day-treatment  at  50  mg  riluzole  bid),  unchanged  riluzole accumulates in plasma by about 2 fold and steady-state is reached in about 5 days.

Administering oral dosing of 25, 50 or 100 mg twice daily, the elimination half-life of riluzole ranges from 9-15 hours with a steady state plasma concentration being reached at 3-8 days. In clinical study 301 the clearance of riluzole remains stable over time up to month 10. No accumulation of the drug with time was observed.

## Absorption

Riluzole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with maximal plasma concentrations occurring within 60 to 90 minutes (Cmax = 173 ng/ml). About 90% of the dose is absorbed and the absolute bioavailability is 60%. The rate and extent of absorption is reduced when riluzole is administered with high-fat meals (decrease in Cmax of 44%, decrease in AUC of 17%).

## Distribution

Riluzole is extensively distributed throughout the body and has been shown to cross the blood brain barrier. The volume of distribution of riluzole is about 245 l (3.4 l/kg). Riluzole is about 97% protein bound and it binds mainly to serum albumin and to lipoproteins.

## Metabolism

Unchanged riluzole is the main component in plasma and is extensively metabolised by cytochrome P450, with subsequent glucuronidation. In vitro studies using human liver preparations demonstrated that  cytochrome  P450  1A2  is  the  principal  isoenzyme  involved  in  the  metabolism  of  riluzole.  The metabolites  identified  in  urine  are  3  phenolic  derivatives,  one  ureido-derivative  and  unchanged riluzole. The pharmacokinetics and biological activity of the metabolites have not been investigated. About 20 metabolites of riluzole are found in urine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Excretion

Less  than  1%  of  riluzole  is  excreted  unchanged.  Most  of  the  substance  is  converted  to  glucuronoconjugated derivatives (pathway through cytochrome P450 1A2 and UDPG-T)). The overall urinary excretion  accounts  for  about  90%  of  the  dose.  Glucuronides  accounted  for  more  than  85%  of  the metabolites in the urine.

## Special populations

The pharmacokinetic parameters of riluzole after multiple dose administration (4.5 days of treatment at 50 mg riluzole bid) were not affected in elderly healthy volunteers (&gt; 70 years). Thus, there are no special instructions for the use of riluzole in this population.

There was no significant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between patients with moderate or severe  chronic  renal  insufficiency  (creatinine  clearance  between  10  and  50  ml.min -1 )  and  healthy volunteers after a single oral dose of 50 mg riluzole. However, since repeated dose administration has not been studied in subjects with renal impairment, treatment of this population is not recommended.

The AUC of riluzole after a single oral dose of 50 mg, increased by about 1.7 fold or 3 fold in patients with mild chronic liver or moderate chronic liver insufficiency, respectively. Riluzole is contraindicated  in  patients  who  have  hepatic  disease  or  have  baseline  transaminases  greater  than  3 times the upper normal limit.

## Efficacy studies

Three randomised controlled trials have been reported, referred to as trials 216, 301 and 302.

Two strata were defined a priori in the study designs: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) of limb or bulbar onset.

Trial  216  was  the  first  trial  and  compared  100  mg  of  Rilutek  with  placebo;  trial  301  was  a  doseresponse trial  comparing  3  doses  with  placebo  and  was  considerably  larger;  trial  302  was  a comparison of 100 mg with placebo in patients ineligible for trial 301. In the three studies, survival, defined by patients who were alive, or not intubated or not tracheotomised was the primary efficacy endpoint. Secondary end-points were functional scores (MRC, NORRIS).

In study 216, patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis of bulbar onset survived longer on Rilutek whereas  in  study  301,  the  two  Rilutek  treated groups  showed  a  marginally  longer  survival  than placebo treated patients, and no effect on survival was shown in study 302. On this basis, taking also into consideration the absence of any evidence of efficacy on symptoms of the disease, concerns were expressed  on  the  robustness  of  the  conclusions  derived  from  the  statistical  analyses  and  on  their generalisation to the population of ALS patients to be treated with Rilutek.

Therefore  an  ad  hoc  experts  group  was  called  by  the  CPMP to  discuss  both  statistical  and  clinical issues  related  to  the  interpretation  of  the  clinical  trials  results.  In  preparation  of  this  expert  group meeting the Company was requested by the CPMP to answer some statistical questions on 20 October 1995 and the ad hoc working group met on 15 November 1995. A technical report summarising the status of methodological issues relating to efficacy of Rilutek was issued at request of the CPMP.

## Study 216

This study was designed as multicentre, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, parallel group trial.  155  patients  aged  19  to  75,  were  randomised  to  riluzole  100 mg/day  (50 mg  twice  daily,  77 patients) or placebo (78 patients ) and were followed-up for 12 to 21 months.

The ALS patients were stratified at entry into limb or bulbar onset form. Main exclusion criteria were: tracheotomy  present  or  pending,  dementia,  vital  capacity  ratio  &lt;60%, significant  renal  or  hepatic impairment. Patients who were pregnant, lactating or taking potentially hepatotoxic drugs were also excluded from the study.

The main efficacy endpoint was overall survival at one year . Secondary endpoints were changes from baseline in functional evaluation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  primary  analysis,  survival  was  significantly  prolonged  for  patients  who  received  riluzole  as compared to patients who received placebo (survival rates were 55.8% versus 48.70 % for riluzole and placebo, respectively; p value = 0.116 Logrank test; p value = 0.047 Wilcoxon test; p value = 0.08 Cox  model).  All  other  analyses  reached  the  significance  level  whatever  the  cut-off  date  or  the statistical  test  was.  The  effect  was  more  pronounced  in  patients  with  bulbar  onset  form  (increase  in survival time of about 8 months in comparison with placebo treated patients). The enhanced efficacy amongst the bulbar stratum in  comparison to the population  with limbar  onset  was  observed in the context of a sub-group analysis, and was not confirmed in later trials.

Overall, study 216 provided evidence of efficacy on survival: Nevertheless, no functional effect was evidenced.

## Study 301

This  study  was  designed  as  a multicentre,  double  blind,  placebo-controlled,  randomised,  parallel group, dose ranging study.

Study 301 was a confirmatory trial comparing 3 doses of riluzole with placebo and was considerably larger than trial 216.

959 patients with ALS were randomised to one of four treatment groups: riluzole 50, 100, 200 mg/day, or placebo and were followed-up for 18 months. The ALS patients were stratified at entry into limb or bulbar onset form. Main exclusion criteria were: tracheotomy present or pending, dementia, vital capacity ratio &lt; 60%, significant renal or hepatic impairment. Also patients pregnant, lactating or taking potentially hepatotoxic drugs were excluded.

The primary efficacy variable was survival with failure defined as death, tracheotomy or intubation at 18 months. Secondary efficacy parameters were changes from baseline in functional evaluations.

The comparison of 100 mg with placebo was defined in the protocol as the primary comparison.

In  patients  treated  with  riluzole  100 mg/day,  survival  was  significantly  higher  compared  to  patients who received placebo (survival rates were 56.8% versus 50.4% for riluzole and placebo, respectively; p value = 0.05, Wilcoxon test. p value = 0.07 log-rank test; p value = 0.002 Cox model). No interaction of the treatment effect with the type of ALS was observed.

The effect of riluzole 50 mg/day was not statistically significant compared to placebo and the effect of 200 mg/day was essentially comparable to that of 100 mg/day.

No changes were observed from baseline in the functional evaluation.

At the CPMP request, the Company provided a full Cox model analysis for trial 301 including all predefined  co-variables to see if these agreed with the results  of their selected  model presented in the study report. The key point of interest was the level of statistical significance attached to the treatment effects in the full Cox model. As was anticipated, the P-values were less extreme (50 mg p =0.082, 100 mg p =0.003, 200mg p =0.001) but the levels of significance attached to the higher dose levels remained high.

Concerns were discussed by the CPMP on any eventual implication of the interim analysis of survival in  conjunction  with  the  early  stopping  of  the  trial.  The  CPMP  asked  the  Rapporteur  to  contact  the Chairman  of  the  data  monitoring  committee  of  trial  301  to  clarify  the  procedures  surrounding  the interim analyses. He stated that the proceedings of the data monitoring committee had been entirely confidential and had  not been revealed to the Company. No Company personnel were either on the committee or present at any of the meetings of the committee. The clinical trial data provided by the Company to the committee were not decoded nor analysed by the Company. They were provided in computer readable form only, code unbroken; the code was then broken and the data analysed at the University  of  Reading.  No  recommendations  were  made  by  the  data  monitoring  committee  to  the Company as a result of the interim analysis of efficacy, and no results had been communicated. The decision of the Company to conclude the trial at the end of 1994 was not related to the work of his committee, but only to the recruitment of a sufficient number of patients.

There are therefore no implications for the levels of statistical significance achieved in this trial.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Additional  analysis  including  patients  who  had  a  strict  18  months  follow-up  was  performed  at  the request  of  the  CPMP,  to  eliminate  any  aspects  of  data  censoring,  and  also  to  eliminate  potentially reduced  efficacy  during  the  early  months  of  treatment.  In  fact  the  results  of  this  analysis  simply mirrored those of the main analysis.

A  worst  case  analysis  for  the  few patients  lost  to  follow-up  was  provided  and  was  appropriately carried  out.  Not  surprisingly,  levels  of  statistical  significance  were  reduced.  If  the  reliability  of  the results of the Cox analysis is accepted, then robustness to their patient losses is assured.

There  is  clear  statistical  evidence  in  study  301  of  an  effect  of  riluzole at  100  mg  on survival.  The results of the analysis using the Cox model are particularly convincing (p=0.002 in original report) and are not undermined by any of the queries raised. A further analysis by the Company used more robust methods of direct stratification by risk factors in order to confirm the results of the Cox model whilst making fewer assumptions. This confirmation was successful, and similar levels of significance were achieved.

The  duration  of  follow-up  was  defined  in  the  protocol.  Crossing  of  survival  curves  on  prolonged follow-up  is  possible  in  theory but  not  objectively  founded.  In  no  way  could  a  longer  follow-up change  the  initial  18  months  part  of  the  survival  curves,  nor  could  it  change  the  difference  of 3 months between the two medians of survival. Eventually the curves  must  cross, but this does  not invalidate the survival benefit established in this study.

A  GCP  inspection  was  conducted  from  June  to  September  1995  by  the  French  Inspectorate.  Four clinical  centers  have  been  audited:  in  Canada  (Centre  CA  0029),  in  the  United  States  (Centre  US 0711) and in France (Centers FR 0252 and FR 0255). For the French and the U.S.A. centres a joint inspection with FDA has been performed. The inspection focused on the documentation concerning the  determination  of  the  status  at  the  end  of  the  18  months  follow-up  or  at  the  cut-off  date. Documentation of the events deaths, intubation and tracheotomy, and follow-up of patients who had discontinued investigational drug treatment was reviewed.

The compliance to treatment by patients was also reviewed.

The conclusions of the French inspectorate are the following:

' The data reviewed in the course of the inspection for the above-mentioned Clinical Centers can be considered  authentic  and  credible,  and  their  quality  acceptable.  The  audit  of  the  packaging  and labelling of the drugs used in the EU sites did not identify any significant problem.'

## Study 302

This study was designed as a multicentre, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, parallel group trial and  was  a  comparison  of  100  mg  with  placebo  in  patients  ineligible  for  trial  301,  either  with advanced disease or aged over 75 years or with vital capacity ratio less than 60%.

The planned size was 300 patients but only 168 patients were randomised to riluzole 100 mg/day or placebo  and  were  followed  up  for 18  months: the protocolled power  of the study  was therefore  not achieved  in  this  study.  In  this  population  with  decreased  respiratory  function,  survival  was  not significantly higher in the riluzole group compared to the placebo group.

Methodologically,  this  was  a  properly  conducted  controlled  trial.  It  was  smaller  than  planned,  and much smaller than study 301, but slightly larger than study 216.

There  was  some  baseline  imbalance  in  characteristics  of  patients  related  to  prognosis  but  this  was covered  by  the  use  of  the  Cox  model.  It  therefore  contributes  valuable  information,  although  the relevance of the patients included in this study to the potential target population is not entirely clear.

This study did not establish any effect of Rilutek on survival. In view of its relatively small sample size the confidence interval surrounding the finding of no difference is quite wide.

## Meta analysis of studies 216, 301 and 302

A meta analysis of studies 216, 301 and 302 was carried out by the company at request of the CPMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Despite  the  negativity  of  study  302,  the overall  statistical  significance  of  the  treatment  effect  is maintained (p=0.043 log-rank test). The robustness of this finding is assured by the very high overall levels  of  statistical  significance  attached  to  the  Cox  model  (p=0.0004).  Therefore  statistically  the results  of  study  302  could  be  chance  findings  within  the  context  of  an  overall  beneficial  effect  of Riluzole on survival.

The results of the analysis combining the three trials showed that the median survival benefit during a 18 month follow-up was approximately 2 months.

## By-centre analysis

Positive results were most consistent in France, Belgium and the UK. However, small numbers makes this  analysis  by-centre,  impossible  to  interpret  statistically.  The  possible  confounding  with  severity must  also  be  born  in  mind.  Statistically,  the  tests  of  interaction  between  the  treatment  effect  and country were not significant, so that this pattern of result is consistent with chance.

## Mortality as an end-point

If the end-point is taken as mortality only - excluding tracheotomy and intubation - the conclusions do not change. The rate of tracheotomy and/or intubation was very low in studies 216 and 301 indeed and most of these events were followed by death before reaching the cut-off date:

- -study 216:
- 6 tracheotomies in the placebo group: 3 deaths by the cut-off date
- 5 tracheotomies in the riluzole group: 4 deaths by the cut-off date
- -study 301:

10 tracheotomies or intubation in the placebo group: 6 deaths by the cut-off date

12 tracheotomies or intubation in the 100 mg riluzole group: 4 deaths by the cut-off date

## Analysis by risk levels

An  analysis  separating  patients  in  two  risk  levels:  'high  risk'  and  'low  risk'  was a  posteriori performed, based on  an initial risk index  calculated  for  each patient. Efficacy  on survival  was  only apparent in 'high risk' patients of studies 216 and 301, thus evidencing that a benefit on survival can only be demonstrated in patients having reached a certain degree of severity of the disease.

## Questions put to the company

Reservations on the clinical relevance of data observed with the treatment of ALS with Riluzole were discussed in depth by the Committee. These could be summarised as three main issues, which were put to the Company during the hearing held at the CPMP meeting on 13 February 1996:

1. Can  the  lack  of  concordance  between  the  benefit  on  survival  and  the  lack  of  benefit  on functional scales be explained?
2. Can causes of death other than ALS influence the results of the trials?
3. Are the trials robust enough to justify the conclusions drawn from the results?

## The following responses were provided:

1. Lack of correlation in ALS between survival and different functional scales:

The  Manual Muscle Scale, the  Norris  scales (both  used  in  the  pivotal  trials)  and  the  Appel scoring  system  (not  used  in  the  trials  conducted  with  riluzole) failed  -  according  to  the published  literature  -  to  show  any  firm  correlation  with  survival  in  ALS.  This  lack  of correlation was also found in the studies carried out with riluzole treatment. On these grounds, the functional scales are not yet validated as surrogate markers of survival in ALS.

2. As far as the second issue was concerned, it was clearly shown that the deaths due to ALS in the clinical studies submitted were at least 95% of all deaths. This finding was expected, being the natural evolution of the disease rapidly progressive to death. Any concern about the cause of death should be allayed by the design of the randomised, double-blind, controlled trials. The baseline prognostic factors were the same in the placebo and in the Riluzole treatment arm and the overall crude mortality, in terms of time to death, (irrespective of the cause of death) was used as for the primary efficacy end-point.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3. As far as the robustness of the clinical studies is concerned there was substantial discussion. The results obtained showed a median increase in survival time. However, because of the lack of any change in the functional scales and in symptoms the clinical relevance of this results was considered debatable and ethical considerations had to be considered .

## Conclusions on efficacy at the time of granting the marketing authorisation

The original positive  finding  was the  overall  effect  on the  main  efficacy  criterion survival in study 216. This was then replicated in study 301 using the same dose of riluzole.

Study 302 conducted in patients at an advanced stage of the  disease  failed to establish an  effect  on survival. The meta-analysis of the three studies however remained positive .

The overall efficacy results appear not to vary substantially according to disease duration.

The failure to  find any  effect  on  functional  end-points does not affect the reliability  of the survival results but remains a concern even if a score on a specific functional scale has never been validated as a surrogate marker of survival.

There  is  no  doubt  that  effects  on  functional  end-points,  if  established,  would  help  to  support  the survival results. If the levels of statistical significance attached to the survival effects were marginal, this might be an important point. However, the levels of statistical significance arising from the Cox model are sufficiently strong to stand on their own without the need for other support.

In  all  disease  areas  where  survival  data  are  important  (e.g.  AIDS,  cancer) it  is  common  practice  to analyse survival data using all three statistical methods used in this application (logrank test, Wilcoxon test  and  Cox  proportional  hazard  model).  In  general,  with  reasonably  consistent  results,  an  overall pattern of statistical significance in this group of tests is regarded as proof of efficacy, and statements in the protocol preferring one test over the others should not override sensible interpretation. The Cox model  would  be  expected  to  achieve  higher  levels  of  statistical  significance  because  of  its  greater sensitivity, and can be relied upon. The consistent outcome of the different analyses, together with the higher levels of statistical significance associated with the Cox model, is reassuring.

## Post-authorisation efficacy data:

In response to a follow-up measure laid down at the time of granting the marketing authorisation for riluzole the  company  submitted  the  final  study  report  for  study  304,  an  efficacy  study  in  Japanese patients with ALS. In study 304, in which 100 patients received placebo and 10 received riluzole, no significant  differences  were  found  on  the  primary  endpoint  (time  to  disease  progression)  or  on tracheostomy-free survival or in a series of secondary outcome measures.

In response to a request from the CPMP, a meta-analysis of the results from patients randomised to placebo or riluzole 100 mg in studies 216, 301, 302 and 304 was submitted. In total 503 patients were randomised to receive placebo and 493 to receive riluzole.

Following  evaluation of the meta-analysis, the CPMP concluded that the statistical  evidence  for the efficacy  of  riluzole  is  less  secure.  Nevertheless,  given  the  high  levels  of  statistical  significance originally achieved in trials 216 and 301 and the overall results of the new meta-analysis, the balance of probability is still in favour of riluzole.

## Clinical safety

Anaphylactoid reaction, angioedema and pancreatitis have been reported very rarely.

The following adverse reactions  were reported in patients  enrolled in Phase III studies  conducted in North America and Europe.

The listing that follows describes all the adverse events that occurred at a frequency of 1% or more among  794  ALS  patients  receiving  riluzole  and  were  greater  than  placebo  by  1%,  or  were  serious adverse events with frequency greater than placebo during the clinical studies.

The most frequent side-effects related to riluzole were asthenia, nausea and dizziness.

Other  side-effects  were  reported,  although  less  commonly:  abdominal  pain,  headache,  diarrhoea, pneumonia, vertigo, and circumoral paresthesia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Riluzole appears to have potential hepatotoxic effects with cytolytic and cholestatic effect s and  may cause liver dysfunction. Elevations of alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) levels to more than 3 times the upper  limit  of  the  normal  range  (ULN)  were  observed  in  about  10  %  of  the  patients  treated  with riluzole compared to 3.7 % in the placebo group; levels increased to more than 5 times the ULN in about  3%  of  the  patients  treated  with  riluzole  compared  to  2%  of  the  placebo  treated  patients.  The increases in ALT usually appeared within 3 months after the start of therapy with riluzole; they were usually transient and levels returned to below 2 times the ULN after 2 to 6 months while treatment was continued. These increases were rarely associated with jaundice. In patients with increases in ALT to more than 5 times the ULN, treatment was discontinued and the levels returned to less than 2 times the ULN within 2 to 4 months.

Among  approximately  5000  patients  given  riluzole  for  ALS,  there  were  three  cases  of  marked neutropenia  (absolute  neutrophil  count  less  than  500/mm 3 ) ,  all  seen  within  the  first  2  months  of riluzole treatment. In one case, neutrophil counts rose on continued treatment. In a second case, counts rose  after  therapy  was  stopped.  A  third  case  neutropenia  was  associated  with  marked  anaemia: reduction in hemoglobin levels was observed .

No adverse event on cognitive functions were observed.

No adverse effect on cardiovascular and respiratory function were observed.

There has been one significant case of overdose reported with riluzole. In an apparent suicide attempt, a  patient  ingested  up  to  30  times  the  recommended  100 mg  daily  dose.  The  patient  developed methaemoglobinaemia that abated quickly after an infusion of methylene blue.

## 5. Conclusions

Riluzole has been demonstrated to extend survival in two studies conducted in patients with ALS, but not in a third trial.  Survival  was the  main  efficacy  criteria  and  was  considered as a strong outcome measure.

The failure to  find any  effect  on  functional  end-points does not affect the reliability  of the survival results.

The  survival  data  obtained  with  Riluzole  were  analysed  at  several  time-points  to  explore  the robustness of the findings: the general consistency of the findings is of interest, rather than specific achievements of selected significance levels. The consistent outcome of significance levels achieved in the different analyses, together with the higher levels of statistical significance associated with the Cox model, is reassuring.

An effect on functional end-points, if established, would help to support the survival results: however up to date scores on functional scales are not validated as surrogate markers of survival in ALS.

The CPMP in their meeting on 14 February 1996 adopted by scientific consensus a positive opinion on Rilutek.

The Committee in recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation felt it was important to set out  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  the  results  of  the  clinical  trials  on  which  the authorisation  was  based.  The  Committee  felt  that  this  was  particularly important  because  treatment with riluzole does not demonstrate a positive effect on functional symptoms of the disease whilst the magnitude  of  the  effect  on  survival  is  modest.  There  are  therefore  remaining  uncertainties  on  the product in the management of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

The specialist physicians using riluzole will be fully aware of the data.

The therapeutic indication approved is the following:

'Riluzole  is  indicated  to extend  life  or  the  time to  mechanical  ventilation  for  patients  with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Clinical trials have demonstrated that RILUTEK extends survival for patients with ALS.

Survival  was  defined  as  patients  who  were  alive,  not  intubated  for  mechanical  ventilation  and tracheotomy-free.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There  is  no  evidence  that  riluzole  exerts  a  therapeutic  effect  on  motor  function,  lung  function, fasciculations, muscle strength and motor symptoms. Riluzole has not been shown to be effective in the late stages of ALS.

Safety and efficacy of riluzole has only been studied in ALS. Therefore, riluzole should not be used in any other form of motor neurone disease.'

The CPMP recommended that the following information be included in the SPC under the heading 'Further information on clinical trials':

'In a trial, 155 patients were randomised to riluzole 100 mg/day (50 mg twice daily) or placebo and were followed-up for 12 to 21 months. Survival, as defined in the second paragraph of section 4.1., was significantly extended for patients who received riluzole as compared to patients who received placebo.  The  median  survival  time  was  17.7  months  versus  14.9  months  for  riluzole  and  placebo, respectively.

In  a  dose-ranging  trial,  959  patients  with  ALS  were  randomised  to  one  of  four  treatment  groups: riluzole 50, 100, 200 mg/day, or placebo and were followed-up for 18 months. In patients treated with riluzole 100 mg/day,  survival  was  significantly  higher  compared  to  patients  who  received placebo. The effect of riluzole 50 mg/day was not statistically significant compared to placebo and the effect of 200 mg/day was essentially comparable to that of 100 mg/day. The median survival time approached 16.5 months versus 13.5 months for riluzole 100 mg/day and placebo, respectively.

In  a  parallel  group  study  designed  to  assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  riluzole  in  patients  at  a  late stage of the disease, survival time and motor function under riluzole did not differ significantly from that of placebo. In this study the majority of patients had a vital capacity ratio less than 60%.'

In  October  1997,  following the  submission  of  the  final  report  of study 304,  the  CPMP  concluded, following  evaluation  of  the  meta-analysis,  that  the  attempts  to  confirm  statistically  the  apparent differences between trials and their results had not provided any clear answers. The statistical evidence for the efficacy of riluzole is less secure. Nevertheless, given the high levels of statistical significance originally achieved in trials 216 and 301 and the overall results of the new meta-analysis, the balance of probability is still in favour of riluzole.

The CPMP recommended that the  'Further information  on clinical  trials' presented  in  the  SPC  be supplemented with the following statement on the findings of study 304 and the latest meta-analysis:

'In  a  double-blind  placebo-controlled  trial  designed  to  assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  riluzole  in Japanese  patients,  204  patients  were  randomised  to  riluzole  100  mg/day  (50  mg  twice  daily)  or placebo and were followed-up for 18 months. In this study, the efficacy was assessed on inability to walk  alone,  loss  of  upper  limb  function,  tracheostomy,  need  for  artificial  ventilation,  gastric  tube feeding or death.  Tracheostomy-free  survival  in  patients treated with riluzole did not differ significantly from placebo.  However, the power of this study to detect differences between treatment groups was low.  Meta-analysis including this study and those described above showed a less striking effect on survival for riluzole as compared to placebo although the differences remained statistically significant.'
