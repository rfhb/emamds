As a consequence, the recommendations for post-exposure prophylaxis have also been changed in recently updated HIV treatment guidelines. For example, the 2013 BHIVA guideline does not generally recommend post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after exposure from a patient with well treated HIV. Based on these data, the wording on the risk of transmission for HIV products was revised to reflect the current scientific knowledge.   |

Annex II and PL

Annex II

<!-- image -->

The main result of the study was that the major amount of stavudine (about 70 % of dose) is eliminated renally as unchanged stavudine in urine.

This significantly differs from existing data on metabolism in HIV-infected patients. In HIV-infected patients, the absolute amount of stavudine that is eliminated as unchanged substance in the urine is in the same range as in healthy persons. Though, the overall excretion is higher due to other additional ways of elimination. The fraction of a dose that is eliminated renally as unchanged substance is only about 40 %. The reasons for this phenomenon remain unknown. These results were reflected in the SPC. The new data does not question the proposed dose adjustments for renally impaired patients, who should always be monitored carefully.

Annex II was updated to introduce the relevant sentence opportunity of this variation to reformat section 5.1 according to the CHMP Guidance on the Clinical Development of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of HIV Infection. The MAH also took the opportunity to update the contact details of the Belgian local representative in section 6 of the PL.
