## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval of . This scientific discussion has been updated until 30 June 2004. For information on changes after this date please refer to module 8B.

## 1. Introduction

Targretin contains the new chemical entity bexarotene (INN), an anti-neoplastic retinoid. It is related to  the  other  retinoids.  It  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  skin  manifestations  of  advanced  stage cutaneous  T-cell  lymphoma  (CTCL)  patients  refractory  to  at  least  one  systemic  treatment.  The recommended initial dose is 300 mg/m 2 /day, to be taken as a single dose with a meal.

The incidence of CTCL is approximately 1200 new patients annually in Europe with a prevalence of about  16,000.  The  term  CTCL  includes  mycosis  fungoides  and  Sézary  syndrome.  They  usually manifest in the skin as a progressive disease, more common in men, age range usually 45-65 years. Extra cutaneous sites are involved later in the course of the disease. Sézary syndrome is an aggressive systemic variant of mycosis fungoides where there are abnormal circulating lymphocytes. Sézary cells are  hyperchromatic  mononuclear  cells  in  the  peripheral  blood  containing  convoluted  or  ceribriform nuclei.

Current systemic therapy for CTCL includes interferon α , retinoids and PUVA therapy, either alone or in combination, and different monochemotherapy regimens. Radiotherapy and electron beam therapy have been employed for localised lesions. Photophoresis with oral metoxypsoralen and extracorporal irradiation of leukocytes and polychemotherapy regimens have been given for Sezary syndrome.

CTCL  patients  usually  survive  for  many  years  after  diagnosis,  but  there  is  a  risk  of  secondary cutaneous malignancies, such as squamous cell carcinoma, because of the altered immunology caused by  the  disease  or  its  treatment.  The  relative  risk  of  skin  cancers  or  melanoma  is  some  6-8  folds. Ulceration  of  CTCL  with  secondary  infection  is  common  and  about  half  of  the  patients  die  from infection. The risk of infection is higher with immunosuppressive treatment.

Retinoids, such as etretinate and isotretinoin, have been used successfully to treat CTCL. They have been used both as sole agents and as part of combination therapy.

Bexarotene  is  a  synthetic  compound  that  exerts  its  biological  action  through  selective  binding  and activation of the three retinoid X receptors (RXRs): RXR α , β , and γ . Once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate processes such as cellular differentiation and proliferation, apoptosis, and insulin sensitisation. The ability of the RXRs to form heterodimers with various receptor partners that are important in cellular function and in physiology indicates that the biological activities of bexarotene are more diverse than those of compounds that activate the retinoic acid receptors (RARs). In vitro, bexarotene inhibits the growth of tumour cell lines of haematopoietic and squamous cell origin. In vivo, bexarotene causes tumour regression in some animal models and prevents  tumour  induction  in  others.  However,  the  exact  mechanism  of  action  of  bexarotene  in  the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is unknown.

## 2. Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

## Composition

Targretin  capsules  are  presented  as  off-white  oblong  soft  gelatin  capsules,  imprinted  with  the  word 'Targretin'  using  blue  ink  and  containing  a  suspension  of  75  mg  of  micronised  bexarotene  in Macrogol 400. The capsule shell is made from gelatin, which is of animal origin. Gelatin complies with the Note for guidance on minimising the risk of Transmitting animal Spongiform Encephelopathy Agent.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Capsules  are  packaged  in  white  200-ml  high-density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  bottle  with  a  white polypropylene  child-resistant  cap,  and  a  tamper-evident  foil  inner-seal.  Bottles  are  packaged  in  an outer cardboard container.

## Active substance

The  active  substance  bexarotene,  supplied  by  Raylo  Chemical  Inc.,  is  a  new  synthetic  compound representing a sub-class of retinoids, but it is structurally distinct from the vitamin A derived retinoids. Its  chemical  name  is  4-[1-(3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-5,6,7,8-  tetrahydro-2-naphtalenyl)vinyl]  benzene carboxylic acid.

The synthesis of bexarotene has evolved through two routes, which are not basically different. The second (route B) was more economic and more robust than the earlier route A and the impurity profile has been improved.

The first route (route A) was used for early pre-clinical studies and to produce the first lots for clinical trials.

Route B is the intended commercial route to manufacture the drug substance; Route B material has been used in the 6-month toxicology studies and for the majority of clinical studies.

Raylo manufactures the active substance at two facilities sites (Argyll Rd. and Clover Bar).

The  equipment  used  for  the  bexarotene  manufacturing  process  at  the  Argyll  Road  facility  and  the Clover Bar facility is equivalent and similar chemical and physical characteristics of drug substance issued  from  the  two  sites  have  been  shown.    The  drug  substance  is  prepared  using  synthetic transformations that are well precedented in the chemical literature.

The specifications contain all appropriate tests for identity, potency, purity and stability of the active substance. Bexarotene is identified by two methods: IR spectroscopy and HPLC.

The  specifications  for  residual  solvents  that  may  be  present  are  consistent  with  ICH  guidance  on residual solvents and therefore should not give rise to any toxicological problems.

The assay and determination of related substances are done using an isocratic HPLC.

Two identified impurities,  have been routinely detected in bexarotene at levels greater than 0.1%. A further impurity was difficult to detect and although this impurity was present at trace levels (&lt;0.1%) in many of stability study samples, it was not usually detected or reported. A limit of 0.2% has been specified.

The specifications for impurities are qualified by the 6-month rat toxicology study.

Particle size limits are consistent with the data of all available micronised bexarotene batches.

Batch  analysis  data  were  provided  on  seven  batches  (3  pilot  and  4  production-scale)  of  active substance  manufactured  by  route  B  and  used  in  safety  studies,  clinical  trials  and  stability  studies. These data confirm the consistency and uniformity of the synthesis.

Stability  studies  of  three  representative  commercial  batches  of  micronised  bexarotene  have  been carried out according to ICH storage conditions. Data observed for up two years at 25°C / 60% RH and for 6 months at 40°C/75 %RH justifies a re-test period of two years. The product should be stored at a temperature not exceeding 30°C.

Additional stability data performed at 5°C for 24 months and for 12 months at 30°C / 60%RH as well as photostability investigations confirmed the stability of bexarotene.

Nevertheless, bexarotene should be protected from extreme heat and from excessive light exposure.

## Other ingredients

The  excipients  of  the  bulk  suspension  (Macrogol  400,  polysorbate  20,  povidone  K-90,  butylated hydroxyanisole) and the capsule shell (gelatin and titanium dioxide) comply with the corresponding PhEur monograph. The specifications for polysorbate 20 include an upper limit of NMT 1 ppm for ethylene oxide as additive specification to the PhEur. monograph.

Although the specifications of excipients relative to capsule  shell  (sorbitol  special  -glycerine  blend and blue ink Colorcon) are limited, they have been found satisfactory. For the colorant FD&amp;C Blue

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

N°2 aluminium lake (E132) used in the blue printing ink the compliance with the Directive78/25/EEC has been confirmed.

## Product development and finished product

The final polyethylene glycol based formulation was selected after evaluation of protype formulations with  respect  to  hydrophilic-lypophilic  character  of  vehicle,  viscosity  of  suspension,  solubility  of bexarotene in vehicle and bexarotene particle size.

A series of 10 small pilot scale batches (~25.000 capsules) were manufactured at R.P Scherer. Release data for these small batches showed consistent results for dissolution, content uniformity, BHT content and assay, with an RSD for content uniformity no greater than 2.0 %.

Eight scale-up batches including the three registration batches were manufactured using the production scale  manufacturing  process.  Type  of  equipment  used,  main  steps  of  manufacturing  process  are reported. The differences with the pilot scale are minor.

Release data showed similar satisfactory results to pilot scale batches.

The proposed commercial composition of Targretin capsule is essentially similar to the formulations used in the clinical trials.

The  manufacturing  process  involves  the  preparation  of  a  suspension  of  the  active  substance  in  the excipients, which is then encapsulated in soft gelatin.

The manufacturing equipment is described (class and subclass).

Appropriate in-process controls are in place.

A  manufacturing  process  validation  report  is  submitted  for  three  consecutive  full  scale  production batches manufactured with the commercial process parameters specifications (mixer speeds and times) validated during the additional mixing studies. The results of the validation studies are satisfactory.

Control  testing  of  the  finished  product  offers  a  full  guarantee  in  terms  of  safety,  efficacy  and reproducibility of the process.

The  control  test  and  specifications  for  finished  product  are  adequately  drawn  up.  The  identity  is confirmed by IR-spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography. HPLC was also used for the assay and the detection of related substances.

The dissolution test is performed in a two-tier dissolution testing approach, with 0.005% of pancreatin present in the medium. As there is no evidence to suggest that the dissolution method is discriminatory with  respect  to  particle  size  of  the  capsule  fill  suspension  (complete  dissolution  of  the  bexarotene occurs  in  less  than  ten  minutes  when  the  fill  suspension  is  added  to  the  dissolution  medium)  the Marketing Authorisation Holder has included a release test of the bexarotene particle size distribution in the drug product, to ensure that this attribute is controlled in the finished product.

The limits for the bexarotene particle size distribution in the fill suspension are adequately justified.

The impurity limits in the finished product specification are justified by toxicology studies.

The  limits  for  the  microbial  contamination  are  based  on  the  requirements  of  the  USP,  but harmonisation of the Ph.Eur. With the USP with regard to microbiological quality has been realised with the acceptance of the step 4 documents for ICH Q6a.

Results  from  3  commercial  batches  with  printed  capsules  are  presented.  The  results  confirm satisfactory uniformity of the product at release and indicate reliable and consistent performance of the product in clinical use.

## Stability of the product

The results from the stability studies indicate that the capsules exhibited satisfactory potency, purity and physical integrity. The physical appearance of the capsules and the dissolution data obtained show

3

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

no change during storage. The results support the proposed shelf-life of 2 years, as defined in the SPC. The Marketing Authorisation Holder has committed to provide stability data (both real and accelerated data) generated on the first three consecutive production batches of finished product (See section II.3,)

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

In summary, the documentation of substances, materials, methods of production as well as the quality controls is sufficient to ensure a product of appropriate and consistent quality. Information has been provided  in  the  dossier  demonstrating  that  the  medicinal  product  is  made  in  compliance  with  the CPMP Note for Guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via medicinal products.

## 3. Toxico-pharmacological aspects

## Pharmacodynamics

## In vitro studies

The activity of bexarotene has not been explored in models of CTCL, since no pre-clinical models exist.  Therefore  the  exact  mechanism  of  action  of  bexarotene  in  the  treatment  of  cutaneous  T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is unknown. However, the following cell systems are known to respond to RARactive ligands:

## Promyelocytic leukaemia cell system

In  the  HL-60  promyelocytic  leukaemia  cell  system  bexarotene  induced  markers  consistent  with  the induction of apoptosis,  DNA  laddering  and morphological  changes.  At  RXR/RAR-activating concentrations bexarotene was able to inhibit the growth and induce differentiation of the cells and was  also  capable  of  inducing  differentiation  of  leukaemia  cells  from  patients,  including  those  with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). When tested against the APL cell line NB4 (which harbours the same t (5:17) chromosomal translocation detected in the majority of APL patients) bexarotene at concentrations &gt; 1 µ M was able to induce cell cycle arrest in G1 and to induce the expression of the granulocyte diffentiation antigen CD11b on the cell surface.

## HBE Cells

Bexarotene inhibited transcription factor AP-1 (AP-1) activity in cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE)  cells.  Other  agents  known  to  inhibit  AP-1  activity  also  inhibited  the  expression  of  the differentiation  markers.  Bexarotene  has  been  demonstrated  to  have  anti-AP-1  activity  mediated  via RXR α . This effect may account for its ability to inhibit cellular proliferation.

## Squamous cell carcinoma xenograft tumours in nude mice

9cis -RA  suppressed  the  differentiated  squamous  phenotype  with  the  increased  presence  of  basal tumour cells; bexarotene caused no change in the highly differentiated phenotype of the tumour. In addition, bexarotene inhibited the growth of two primary human HNSCC xenograft tumours grown in nude mice, but did not inhibit the growth of 1483 HNSCC xenograft tumours; bexarotene was not a potent antiproliferative agent in these cells.

## Prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP)

Bexarotene  was  ineffective  at  inhibiting  the  growth  of  xenograft  tumours  derived  from  the  human prostate cancer cell line or the transplantable Dunning prostate tumour in the rat.

## Cultured AIDS-KS cells

Bexarotene (10 -8 - 10 -6 M) inhibited cellular proliferation in culture in a dose-dependent manner and similar to ATRA and RAR ligand. These data suggested that bexarotene may have inhibitory activity for AIDS-related KS cells in vivo.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cultured breast cancer cells

Growth of the human oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast carcinoma cell line, T47D, was inhibited in a concentration dependent manner by bexarotene. Bexarotene and TAM appeared to be synergistic in the inhibition of the growth of these cells.

## In vivo studies

Bexarotene inhibited the development of carcinogen-induced mammary carcinomas in the rat similar to tamoxifen (TAM). However, bexarotene did not induce significant changes in circulating levels of oestradiol, progesterone or prolactin. In addition, bexarotene and TAM appeared to be synergistic in this  model.  When  bexarotene  was  added  to  the  TAM  regimen  in  animals  with  TAM-resistant mammary carcinomas, 94% of tumours had an objective response.

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

When bexarotene or gemfibrozil was administered to rats, bifunctional enzyme (BE) and acyl-CoA oxidase  RNAs  were  induced,  and  the  combination  of  bexarotene  and  gemfibrozil  led  to  greater induction.

## General and safety pharmacology programme

Studies  investigating  cardiovascular  and  neuropharmacological  parameters  in  rats  were  performed. Bexarotene administered to rats at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day did not significantly affect mean arterial blood  pressure  or  heart  rate.    Statistically  significant  changes  were  observed  in  two  clotting parameters, but were not biologically important.

Hypertriglyceridaemia was seen after oral administration of bexarotene in a variety of animal models. Oral  administration  of  bexarotene  to  rats  increased  the  plasma  levels  of  ApoA-I  and  HDL  in  the circulation. Induction of ApoA-I occurred at the transcriptional level.

The effects of bexarotene on plasma lipids were determined in male rabbits following 4 days of oral dosing  with  0,  1,  10,  or  100  mg/kg/day.    In  animals  receiving  100  mg/kg,  total  cholesterol  and triglycerides were increased approximately 3- and 10-fold, respectively, whereas HDL cholesterol was unchanged.

Changes  in  clinical  biochemistry  included  increases  in  alkaline  phosphatase  (ALK),  serum  alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), sodium, and globulin and total bilirubin.

A study was conducted in rats to determine the neuropharmacological effects produced of up to 100 mg/kg/day bexarotene for four consecutive days. All rats exhibited normal social behaviour and body weight gain. There were no changes in body temperature.

## Pharmacokinetics

## Single-dose studies

## Oral administration

Plasma bexarotene concentration data from pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies in the rat  and dog demonstrated that bexarotene was orally bioavailable. The increase in plasma AUC values appeared proportional  at  lower  doses  and  less  than  dose-proportional  at  higher  doses.  From  oil  formulations, nonmicronised bexarotene was 30-40% bioavailable in rats and 7.5% bioavailable in dogs. Maximum plasma bexarotene concentrations (Cmax) generally occurred a few hours post-dose (tmax =2 to 4 hr).

## Intravenous (i.v.) administration

Following i.v. administration of bexarotene, clearance was 10 to 20 ml/min/kg in the rat and 2 to 4 ml/min/kg  in  the  dog.  I.v.  kinetics  in  plasma  appeared  multiphasic  in  both  species.  The  t½  of

5

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

bexarotene was 2 hr to 3 hr in rats and 3 hr to 6 hr in dogs. Bexarotene's volume of distribution was close to 1 l/kg, consistent with minimal retention of bexarotene in the extravascular tissues. There was no overall sex difference in pharmacokinetics in either species.

## Repeat dose studies

In  rats  repeat  dose  Cmax  and  AUC  values  increased  with  increasing  dose  but  were  less  than  dose proportional.  Plasma  bexarotene  concentrations  in  rats  were  almost  always  dose-dependently  lower after repeat-dose administration than concentrations after a single dose. The extent of this reduction in concentrations generally did not increase beyond 28 days of dosing. The magnitude of the reduction tended to be greater in male rats than in female rats.

In all of the toxicity studies conducted in dogs, systemic exposure to bexarotene was dose-dependent. There was dose-dependent reduction in exposure associated with repeated dosing. In a 28-day toxicity study in which nonmicronised bexarotene was administered in babassu oil at 10 to 200 mg/kg/day, Cmax and AUC(0-6) values were 2-fold and 4-fold lower respectively on day 28 compared to day 1 at 10 mg/kg and 3-fold and 6-fold lower at 30 mg/kg.

## Absorption

The  oral  bioavailability  of  bexarotene  was  formulation-dependent.  For  micronised  drug  in  rat  and nonmicronised  drug  in  dog,  suspensions  in  oil  tended  to  provide  greater  bioavailability  than suspensions  containing  PEG.  Bioavailability  of  nonmicronised  bexarotene  was  also  significantly greater  from  a  PEG-based  solution  formulation  than  that  from  oil-  or  PEG-based  suspension formulations in dogs. These data suggested that dissolution may be rate-limiting for drug absorption and that bexarotene particle size reduction could enhance bioavailability.  These studies established that micronised bexarotene was about six times more bioavailable than nonmicronised bexarotene and that different lots of micronised bexarotene exhibited similar pharmacokinetics.  An experimental lot of clinical capsules that developed pellicles in dissolution testing displayed pharmacokinetics similar to  one  that  did  not  form  pellicles.  The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  stated  that  data  from  these studies  aided  in  selection  of  the  clinical  dose  in  transitioning  from  nonmicronised  to  micronised bexarotene in phase I-II trials, and setting bexarotene particle size specifications for Targretin capsules intended for commercial use.

## Distribution

A study in rats demonstrated that drug-related radioactivity distributed essentially throughout the body after an oral dose of radiolabelled bexarotene. At the 4-hr time point, radioactivity was present in all of the 26 tissues examined. Other than organs of the gastro-intestinal tract, tissue-to-plasma radioactivity ratios were greatest in liver, kidneys and adrenals over four timepoints examined (4, 8, 24 and 48 hrs). No substantial retention occurred in any tissue; less than 1% of the radioactivity remained in the rats at 48 hrs.

A study in athymic mice revealed that bexarotene was capable of penetrating into solid tumour.

## Protein binding studies

Bexarotene was highly protein bound (&gt;99.9%) at concentrations present in the rat and dog plasma in toxicity studies.

## Metabolism

In the rat  and dog  bexarotene  was  metabolised  primarily  by  P450-dependent  oxidation  and glucuronidation. Systemic exposure to these metabolites (6- or 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6- or 7- oxobexarotene) was found to be less than that to parent compound after both single and multiple doses. 6Hydroxy-bexarotene was a major circulating metabolite of bexarotene and glucuronides were the most prevalent  bexarotene  metabolites  in  bile.  In  rats,  the  primary  biliary  glucuronide  was  the  acyl glucuronide  of  the  parent  compound.  In  dogs,  the  primary  biliary  glucuronide  was  the  acyl glucuronide of 6- or 7-hydroxy-bexarotene. Overall bexarotene metabolism was qualitatively similar between the rat and the dog.

6

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Excretion

In  a  rat  oral-dose  tissue  distribution  study  using  100  mg/kg  radiolabelled  bexarotene,  &gt;90%  of  the radioactivity was excreted in the faeces by 48 hours in both sexes. Presence of the majority of excreted bexarotene  in  the  faeces  after  an  i.v.  dose  provided  evidence  for  hepatobiliary  excretion  of  the compound.  The  metabolism  and  excretion  data  indicated  that  the  hepatobiliary  excretion  and subsequent faecal elimination of glucuronide conjugates (or parent compound in the dog) constitute the primary and almost exclusive means of bexarotene elimination in the rat and dog.

## Enzyme induction

A  rat  study  revealed  that  4  days  of  daily,  oral  bexarotene  treatment  (600  mg/m 2 )  significantly increased (by 91%) gross hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450. Levels of some specific cytochrome P450  isozymes  decreased  significantly  (90%  for  CYP1A2  and  41%  for  CYP2C11)  while  others increased significantly (CYP2B1/B2 by 28-fold, CYP3A by 8.2-fold and CYP4A by 71-fold). Rates of cytochrome P450 and glucuronyltransferase-mediated bexarotene metabolism were increased significantly in  these  microsomal  preparations  (by  252% and 77%, respectively), further supporting metabolic induction by bexarotene as a potential mechanism contributing to the reduction of systemic exposure after repeated dosing.

## Other studies

Pharmacokinetic data were collected during two repeated dose pharmacodynamic  studies of bexarotene in rats. Systemic drug exposure was dose-dependent and lower than dose-proportional in both studies.

## Transferability across the placenta and distribution into milk

Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. Based on the comparison of animal and patient exposures  to  bexarotene,  a  margin  of  safety  for  human  teratogenicity  has  not  been  demonstrated. Bexarotene is contraindicated in pregnancy.

It  is  not  known  whether  bexarotene  is  excreted  in  human  milk.    Bexarotene  should  not  be  used  in breast-feeding  mothers. This information has been included in the SPC (See section 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation).

## Systemic exposure in animals compared to patients

Cmax and AUC increase proportionally to the dose in dog and in rat at the lower doses, and less than proportionally  at  higher  doses.  Plasma  concentrations  depend  on  dose,  formulation  and  duration  of treatment. Consequently, the exposure must be estimated by measured concentrations (AUC)

Table 1: Systemic exposure in preclinical and clinical studies

| Species     | Rat n = 10/sex   | Rat n = 10/sex   | Dog n = 6/sex/Dose   | Dog n = 6/sex/Dose   | Patients   |

There does not appear to be a safety margin relative to human clinical exposure.

## Toxicology

## Single dose toxicity

In the rat the maximum feasible single dose of 1500 mg/kg nonmicronised bexarotene suspended in sesame oil induced no treatment-related toxicity.

7

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Administration to 2 dogs/sex/group at 0 or 720 mg/kg (maximum feasible dose in this species) elicited transient decreases in body weight and in serum cholesterol, LDL and HDL. There were no treatmentrelated  findings  at  gross  pathology.  Pharmacokinetic  analyses  at  fixed  intervals  post-dose  revealed mean bexarotene Cmax and AUC values of up to 60,800 ng/ml and 565,000 ng.h/ml respectively. On a AUC basis the systemic exposure was 112 (males) to 148 (females) times higher than that in patients at the recommended initial human dose (AUC of 3797 ng.h/ml after 300 mg/m 2 /day multiple dose).

## Repeated dose toxicity

Repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  (according  to  GLP)  consisted  of  oral  dose  studies  of  approximately  4 week, 3 months and 6 months duration in the rat and dog (with 28 day recovery periods).

The main adverse treatment related findings were:

- -Mortality related to serious coagulopathy in rats
- -Hepatic toxicity in rats and dogs
- -Cataracts in rats and dogs
- -Adrenal gland hypertrophy in rats and dogs
- -Testicular degeneration in dogs.

Other adverse treatment related findings were:

- -Adverse local tolerance effects in the rat
- -Effects on haematology parameters in rats and dogs
- -Effects on haematopoietic tissues in the dog

## Mortality related to serious coagulopathy in rats

In the repeat-dose rat studies, dose-related mortality due to haemorrhage and serious coagulopathy was associated with bexarotene administered at doses &gt; 10 mg/kg/day in sesame oil suspension by gavage or in a diet.  The coagulopathy was associated with bexarotene-related prolongation of prothrombin (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) (&gt;30 seconds). Vitamin K supplementation reduced the coagulopathy.

In  3-month  and  6-month  studies  in  rats  in  which  bexarotene  was  administered  by  gavage  in  a PEG/aqueous  suspension,  haemorrhage  due  to  serious  coagulopathy  was  not  observed,  despite findings of higher PT and APTT in male rats compared to controls. PT or APTT was not increased in females.  Deaths  in  these  studies  appeared  to  be  related  to  gavage  injury  as  the  major  precipitating event possibly related to hyperkeratosis induced in the oesaphagus (see below).

In contrast to the rat, no deaths related to serious coagulopathy occurred in the dog studies. Therefore this finding appears to be related to the oral administration of sesame oil to rats.

## Liver toxicity in rats and dogs

Reversible hepatomegaly occurred in rats and dogs following repeat dosing with bexarotene. In both species, the liver returned to a normal size by the end of a 28-day treatment-free recovery period.

The increase in liver weight was associated with increases in the serum levels of the liver enzymes. In addition  hepatocellular  degeneration,  necrosis,  vacuolisation  and  pigment  deposition  were  present.

The effects were reversible following the 28-day treatment-free recovery periods. In the 6-month rat study  with  a  3-month  interim  sacrifice  up  to  a  100%  increase  in  liver  weight  associated  with  liver hypertrophy was observed at 2 to 3 months. There was no liver hypertrophy at 6 months of treatment, suggesting an adaptation to the drug effects.

In  the  3-month  dog  study,  no  liver  weight  increases  or  adverse  liver  histopathology  were  observed after 91 days of treatment with nonmicronised bexarotene doses up to 1.5 mg/kg/day. By contrast in the 6-month dog study there were significant increases in relative liver weights associated with liver hypertrophy at  3  or  10  mg/kg/day  micronised  bexarotene.  After  a  4-week  recovery  period,  relative liver weights of treated dogs were comparable to controls; however, slight liver hypertrophy was still present in all dogs at the end of recovery.  No liver effects occurred at 1 mg/kg/day.

In conclusion, the adverse treatment related effects on the liver observed in two species appeared to be mainly almost completely reversible upon cessation of treatment.

## Cataracts in rats and dogs

In the 6-month studies in rats and dogs dose-related posterior subcapsular cataracts developed in both species.

Cataracts in the rats were more severe and progressive than in dogs. In the 6-month rat study, prior to early  sacrifice  in  week  8  of  the  300  mg/kg/day  (top)  dose  group  there  was  a  51%  incidence  of cataracts. The cataracts increased in severity and incidence during the course of treatment at 3, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day and were not reversible upon cessation of treatment. In dogs, cataracts affected only a limited  area  in  the  posterior  capsule,  were  bilateral,  and  appeared  non-progressive.  In  the  26-week study,  cataract  formation  occurred  after  11  weeks  of  treatment  at  3  and  10  mg/kg/day  and  the incidence increased .at study termination.

The NOEL for cataracts in dogs was 1 mg/kg/day and in rats was &lt;30 mg/kg/day. Based on AUC systemic  exposure  for  doses  inducing  cataract  formation,  there  does  not  appear  to  be  a  margin  of safety relative to human clinical exposure. There was no evidence in either species that the cataracts were reversible upon cessation of treatment. The Marketing Authorisation Holder has not provided a mechanistic explanation for this finding, the aetiology of which is unexplained. Although this finding has not been reported in the clinical data, the seriousness and lack of reversibility make this finding a matter of concern..

## Adrenal gland hypertrophy in rats and dogs

Dose-related transient increases in adrenal weights were a common finding, but were reversible upon treatment cessation. This finding is probably not of clinical relevance.

## Testicular degeneration in dogs

Testicular  tubular  degeneration,  reversible  after  treatment  cessation,  occurred  only  in  sexually immature dogs (&lt; 5 months) that were treated for up to 3 months with &gt; 0.1 mg/kg/day of bexarotene. Sexually mature (&gt;8 months) dogs given daily doses of bexarotene for 6 months did not show any testicular abnormalities even at higher doses (up to 10 mg/kg). This finding is probably not of clinical relevance.

## Adverse local tolerance effects in the rat

Acanthosis and hyperkeratosis of the epithelium in the non-glandular stomach and acanthosis of the skin occurred at &gt; 30 mg/kg/day in the rat 6-month study. This finding was reversible upon cessation of treatment.

## Effects on haematology parameters in rats and dogs

In the rat 6-month and the dog 26-week studies the haematocrit, haemoglobin and erythrocyte values were decreased and the platelet count increased. These findings were reversible.

## Effects on haematological tissue in the dog

Hypercellularity of haematopoietic cells in sternal bone marrow occurred in 5/12 dogs at the top dose of 10 mg/kg/day. The study report did not state whether this finding was reversible. It does not seem to have occurred in other studies.

## Genotoxicity

Bexarotene was not genotoxic in the standard genotoxicity test battery in vitro and in vivo.

## Carcinogenicity

In view of the proposed therapeutic indication and intended patient population, carcinogenicity studies are not considered necessary.

## Reproduction toxicity

Fertility studies have not been carried out. A possible impact on fertility can not be excluded. A  dose  range  finding  (conducted  at  up  to  65  mg/kg/day  p.o.)  and  a  definitive  study  (at  up  to  16 mg/kg/day p.o.) were conducted to evaluate the potential for developmental toxicity of bexarotene in

9

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rats. These studies demonstrated that bexarotene, in common with the majority of retinoids, was both teratogenic and embryotoxic in oral-dose studies at systemic exposures achieved clinically in patients.

The teratogenic effects of retinoids are well documented therefore it was not considered necessary to conduct further studies.

Bexarotene is contraindicated both in pregnancy and during lactation. Advice is given that women of childbearing potential should employ adequate birth control measures (see section 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation ).

## Local tolerance

In  support  of  the  parallel  clinical  development  of  bexarotene  gel  as  a  topical  product,  the  local tolerance of bexarotene was investigated.

Dermal toxicity assessed in a 28 day study in the rat at gel strengths of 0.01%, 0.1% or 1.0% w/w revealed  time  and  dose-related  increased  incidence  and  severity  of  erythema  (slight  to  mild), epidermal scaling, scabbing and thickening, confined to the site of administration.

Bexarotene  topical  gel  at  &lt;  1.0%  w/w  did  not  appear  to  be  a  skin  sensitiser  in  the  guinea  pig. Treatment related reactions appeared to be dermal irritation, possibly associated with some component of the vehicle, based on the similarity of reaction in vehicle and test article formulations.

## Ecotoxicity/Environmental risk assessment

The Marketing Authorisation Holder states that bexarotene will not be manufactured in the E.U. The expected patient numbers in the E.U. is not anticipated to exceed 1200 patients/annum, therefore it is a low  volume  compound.  Its  therapeutic  use  is  not  considered  to  have  an  immediate  effect  on  the environment.

## Other toxicity studies

High  concentrations  of  bexarotene  appear  to  have  a  weak  potential  to  be  phototoxic  and  photoirritating  as  determined  by in vitro haemoglobin  oxidation  and  histidine  assays  respectively. Bexarotene  was  not  photocytotoxic  in  a  human  skin  model  of  normal  epidermal  keratinocytes.  A protein  photo-binding  assay  in  human  serum  albumin  showed  that  bexarotene  is  capable  of  photoinduced binding and therefore may be a potential photoallergen.

## Discussion on toxico-pharmacological aspects

Bexarotene is a new synthetic retinoid that binds selectively to three RXR receptors. The link between bexarotene-mediated RXR signalling and the effect in CTCL has not been precisely established. The retinoids, including RXR-selective ligands, can modulate T-cell biology, which can have relevance for a possible mechanism of action of bexarotene in CTCL.

Bexarotene formulations used in preclinical studies have changed during development. Suspensions of nonmicronised bexarotene in sesame oil (rats) and babassu oil (dogs) were used in preliminary studies.

These suspensions were replaced by suspensions in polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG) and nonmicronised bexarotene was replaced with micronised bexarotene, used in the pivotal 26-week dog and rat studies.

Bexarotene was bioavailable following oral administration in both test species. Systemic exposure was decreased upon repeat dosing, which could be attributed to metabolic enzyme induction.

Interaction studies were not performed, as reflected in the SPC. These studies will be performed as a post-marketing commitment.

In repeated dose-toxicity studies conducted in rats and in dogs, the target organs of bexarotene were eyes  (cataractogenic  in  both  rats  and  dogs  with  no  signs  of  recovery  after  28  days),  liver  (weight increase,  hypertrophy,  biliary  stasis  in  dogs,  glycogen  deposition  in  rats,  slight  necrosis  in  both species), adrenals (weight increase, some  vacuolisation of cortical cells) and haematological parameters (reduction in RBC count, increase in platelet count, prolongation of PT and APTT in rats). In  rats,  bexarotene  induced  hyperkeratosis  and  acanthosis  of  the  oesophagus  and  the  non-glandular stomach and follicular atrophy and acanthosis of the skin.

Mortality was observed in both species. Hyperkeratosis of the oesophagus was probably the cause of gavage-related  injury  leading  to  an  increase  of  the  mortality  in  treated  rats;  however,  the  cause  of death was not clearly established in treated dogs.

Bexarotene was cataractogenic at dosages comparable to human  exposition. The Marketing Authorisation  Holder  partially  addressed  the  mechanism  of  cataract  formation  in  animal  studies.

10

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However,  the  relevance  of  animal  findings  to  the  human  situation  is  still  not  clear.  Moreover,  the clinical  follow-up  of  patients  was not  long  enough  to  exclude  a  cataractogenic  effect  of  bexarotene treatment. The Marketing Authorisation Holder will closely monitor this effect.

Bexarotene is teratogenic and embryotoxic at dosages comparable to human exposure. Fertility and peri-  and  post-natal  effects  of  bexarotene  were  not  evaluated.  The  use  of  bexarotene  has  to  be contraindicated during pregnancy. Adequate birth-control measures have to be employed by women of childbearing potential.

Bexarotene is not mutagenic. Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed.

## 4. Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The clinical trials were performed according to GCP standards and agreed ethical principles.

## Clinical pharmacology

A total of three dose-ranging phase I-II involving 141 cancer patients were conducted. See Table 2.

Table 2: Dose-ranging studies

| Protocol no.   | Design/Phase                        |   N | Tumour                                      | Duration of treatment   | Treatment                                                                                                                                                                 |

There were a further 11 studies where Targretin capsules were given to approximately 500 patients with  a  range  of  diagnoses  from  advanced  solid  tumours,  psoriasis  and  diabetes  mellitus.  In  these studies the doses ranged from 5-1000 mg/m 2 /day.

## Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

Bexarotene  is  a  synthetic  compound  that  exerts  its  biological  action  through  selective  binding  and activation of the three retinoid X receptors (RXRs): RXR α , β , and γ . Once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate processes such as cellular differentiation and proliferation, apoptosis, and insulin sensitisation. The ability of the RXRs to form heterodimers with various receptor partners that are important in cellular function and in physiology indicates that the biological activities of bexarotene are more diverse than those of compounds that activate the retinoic acid receptors (RARs).

It is not known if the clinical response is supported only by the RXR activation effect.

11

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pharmacokinetic data (plasma levels obtained after Targretin administration) and in vitro binding data suggested  that  a  continuous  activation  of  RXR  receptors  is  obtained  after  the  administration  of  the initial  dose  of  300  mg/m²/day.  Additionally  a  partial  activation  of  RAR  receptors  may  also  be obtained.

The  plasma  concentrations  of  Targretin  observed  after  repeated  dose  administration  suggested  that activation of RXR receptors could be obtained at peak as well as at trough concentrations.

RAR activation is unlikely to be obtained at trough concentrations.

## Dose finding studies

At least three patients at each dose level were evaluated.  If, after two weeks of treatment, no doselimiting toxicity (DLT) was observed in the first three patients, then three patients could be entered into  the  next  higher  dose  level.  The  MTD  was  defined as the highest dose level that resulted in  no more than one patient experiencing a DLT among at least six patients who had completed at least four weeks of treatment.

The  studies  began  with  the  non-micronised  formulation  of  bexarotene.  Because  of  a  change  in formulation, the micronised formulation of bexarotene was introduced at one-sixth the daily dose of the original non-micronised formulation. The micronised formulation of bexarotene was considered to have 6 to 8 times better oral bioavailability than the non-micronised formulation.

There were 9 patients with CTCL enrolled in L1069-93-01 study. Two of 9 patients improved while on bexarotene, which provided an early indication of bexarotene in CTCL. These patients responded to low doses of Targretin capsules (5 mg/m 2 /day and 20 mg/m 2 /day of non-micronised formulation). Four other CTCL patients treated in the range of 10 to 65 mg/m 2 /day of non-micronised formulation and three patients treated in the range of 230 to 300 mg/m 2 /day of the micronised formulation did not respond.

The  recommendation  regarding  BID  or  QD  dosing  could  not  be  made  based  on  small  number  of patients studied at each dosing schedule in L1069-94-02 study.

The initial starting dose chosen was the MTD determined from study L1069-93-02 (650 mg/m 2

/day). The  low  dose  level  in  one  treatment  arm  in  L1069-23  study  (6,5  mg/m 2 /day)  was  selected  to approximate  the  dose  level  (adjusted  for  the  micronised  formulation)  at  which  responses  were observed in L1069-93-01 study.

## Pharmacokinetics

## Introduction

The pharmacokinetics of bexarotene were evaluated during 6 clinical studies in patients with advanced cancers (3 studies), type II diabetes mellitus (1 study) and CTCL (2 studies). One study of relative bioavailability of Targretin capsules 75 mg and a bexarotene suspension has also been performed in 12 healthy volunteers:

Most patients were males (2/3), with the median age of 60 years. Tested treatments were administered concomitantly with food intake after 8-hour diet. The patients were not to have received other drugs susceptible to alter renal or hepatic function. Pharmacokinetics were linear up to a dose of 650 mg/m 2 .

## Absorption

Initial  data  from  patients  in  trial  L1069-93-01  and  L1069-93-02  showed  that  the  micronised formulation had significantly greater bioavailability than the non-micronised form (n=10) and only the micronised form was used for the rest of the trial. The initial half-life was 1.4 h with no accumulation with multiple daily doses.

Over the dose range proposed in the SPC, the half-life was approximately 2 h and the Cmax and AUC increased dose proportionally. Absorption was enhanced by about 40% when bexarotene was taken with a fat containing dietary supplement in diabetic patients.

Bioavailability (Cmax and AUC) decrease of Targretin after repeated administration is observed only in animal models during preclinical studies and in patients with no CTCL, enrolled in phase I and phase II  studies.  This  decrease  of  Targretin  bioavailability  was  explained  by  the  existence  of  an  autoinduction of Targretin metabolism.

These findings suggested that auto-induction might alter bioavailability of Targretin in patients with CTCL and consequently its clinical effect after repeated dosing. Nevertheless, PK studies conducted in

12

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients with CTCL at the recommended doses, shows no alteration of the bioavailability of Targretin in  this  patient  group,  suggesting  that  metabolic  capacity  of  patients  with  CTCL  is  not  altered  after reiterated dosing.

Additionally, clinical experience shows that therapeutic response to bexarotene continued to occur at least up to 26,6 weeks after the initiation of the treatment.

A  decrease  of  plasma  concentrations  depending  of  the  duration  of  treatment  was  observed  in preclinical  studies  in  rat  and  dog.  These  observations  were  consistent  with  an  auto-induction  of bexarotene metabolism.

In  humans,  there  was  no  decrease  of  plasma  concentrations  after  multiple  dosing  in  patients  with CTCL. During phase I-II  studies  a  reduction  of  bexarotene  concentrations  was  observed  within  15 days of dosing. For these patients no further decrease of plasma concentrations was observed after day 15.

The mechanism causing the lowering of plasma levels after multiple dosing was investigated in animal models (rat hepatic microsomes). An increase cytochrome P450 iso-enzyme was specifically observed with CYP3A4 after repeated administration of bexarotene.

In conclusion, a potential of auto-induction of metabolism of Targretin exists. But, no consequences of this mechanism have been observed in patients with CTCL at the recommended doses.

## Protein binding

In study RR-845-99-002 the binding of radiolabelled drug to plasma proteins was high at 99.8-99.9% and was independent of the bexarotene concentration over the range tested.

## Metabolism

The predominant plasma metabolites are formed by oxidation at the C-6 and C-7 positions to form 6and  7-hydroxy-bexarotene  and  bexarotene  acyl  glucuronide.  For  all  metabolites  the  C-6  isomer predominated over C-7 in humans. In  vitro studies  suggest  that  cytochrome  P450 3A4  is  the  major cytochrome  P450  isozyme  responsible  for  formation  of  the  oxidative  metabolites.  Based  on  the in vitro binding  and  the  retinoid  receptor  activation  profile  of  the  metabolites,  and  on  the  relative amounts of individual metabolites in plasma, the metabolites have little impact on the pharmacological profile of retinoid receptor activation by bexarotene.

## Elimination

There  was  no  detectable  difference  in  clearance  with  the  first  dose  or  multiple  doses  up  to  400 mg/m 2 /day  in  study  L1069-93-01.  The  elimination  half-life  was  approximately  1-3  hours  when determined over a six-hour sampling interval. In some patients with 24-hour post sampling schedules the mean terminal elimination half-life was 7-9 hours.

Neither bexarotene nor its metabolites are excreted in urine in any appreciable amounts. The estimated renal clearance of bexarotene is less than 1 ml/minute. Faecal excretion was not measured, but it is assumed that elimination of the drug and its metabolites are primarily hepatobiliary.

## Pharmacokinetics in special populations

No formal studies to assess kinetics in special patient populations have been performed

Use in children and adolescents: Targretin should not be used in a paediatric population until further data become available.

Use in the elderly: of the total number of patients with CTCL in clinical studies, 61% were 60 years or older,  while  30%  were  70 years  or  older.    No  overall  differences  in  safety  were  observed  between patients  70 years  or  older  and  younger  patients,  but  greater  sensitivity  of  some  older  individuals  to Targretin capsules cannot be ruled out.  The standard dose should be used in the elderly.

Renal  insufficiency: no  formal  studies  have  been  conducted  in  patients  with  renal  insufficiency. Clinical pharmacokinetic data indicate that urinary elimination of bexarotene and its metabolites is a minor  excretory  pathway  for  bexarotene.  In  all  evaluated  patients,  the  estimated  renal  clearance  of bexarotene was less than 1 ml/minute.  In view of the limited data, patients with renal insufficiency should be monitored carefully while on Targretin capsule therapy.

Hepatic insufficiency: no  formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Clinical and animal pharmacokinetic data suggest that bexarotene is eliminated through hepatobiliary

13

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mechanisms.    Although  there  was  no  evidence  for  altered  bexarotene  pharmacokinetics  in  patients with elevated serum bilirubin, SGPT/ALT, SGOT/AST, or alkaline phosphatase, patients with hepatic insufficiency  may  theoretically  have  altered  bexarotene  pharmacokinetics.  Therefore,  patients  with hepatic insufficiency should be monitored carefully while on Targretin capsule therapy.

Sex and ethnic origin: No relationship in the kinetics between sex or ethnic origin was studied.

## Interaction studies

The  data  are  limited.  Therefore  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  has  agreed  to  perform  further interaction studies (see section II.3, Follow-up measures of the Marketing Authorisation Holder ).

Drug  interactions:  effects  of  other  substances  on  bexarotene: No  formal  studies  to  evaluate  drug interactions  with  bexarotene  have  been  conducted.  On  the  basis  of  the  oxidative  metabolism  of bexarotene by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), co-administration with other CYP substrates such as ketoconazole,  itraconazole,  protease  inhibitors,  clarithromycin  and  erythromycin  may  theoretically lead  to  an  increase  in  plasma  bexarotene  concentrations.  Furthermore,  co-administration  with CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampicin, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or phenobarbital may theoretically cause a reduction in plasma bexarotene concentrations.

A  population  analysis  of  plasma  bexarotene  concentrations  in  patients  with  CTCL  indicated  that concomitant administration of gemfibrozil resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown.

There are some retrospective data on kinetics from study L1069-23 for patients taking levothyroxine, atorvastatin and gemfibrozil. Bexarotene concentrations were not affected by concomitant administration  of  atorvastatin  or  levothyroxine.  Concomitant  administration  of  gemfibrozil  with Targretin capsules is not recommended.

Drug interactions: effects of bexarotene on other substances: There are indication that bexarotene may induce CYP3A4. Therefore, repeated administration of bexarotene may result in an auto-induction of its own metabolism and, particularly at dose levels greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, may increase the rate of metabolism and reduce plasma concentrations of other substances metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4. For example bexarotene may reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives.

After the granting of the Authorisation of Targretin, the MAH submitted a variation application on the basis of the interim analysis report of clinical trial L1069-34. This is an open-label, multicenter Phase II  study  for  the  'Evaluation  of  Targretin  (bexarotene)  capsules  in  Patients  with  Advanced  Breast Cancer' to determine the activity of Targretin at two different dose levels in the treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer. Secondary objectives included determination of bexarotene pharmacokinetics in women with breast cancer and determination of plasma tamoxifen concentrations in  women  receiving  concomitant  Targretin  capsules  and  tamoxifen  therapy.  The  mechanism  of  the observed interaction between bexarotene and tamoxifen is unclear and the clinical significance of the diminution  of  tamoxifen  AUC  (35%)  is  not  established.  The  CPMP  considered  that  the  most appropriate way to include this information on a possible interaction would be to modify the statement under section 4.5 of the Summary of Product Characteristics:

'Bexarotene  may  increase  the  rate  of  metabolism  and  reduce  plasma  concentrations  of  other substances metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4, such as tamoxifen .'

Laboratory test interactions: CA125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be accentuated with Targretin capsule therapy.

Food  interactions: in  all  clinical  trials,  patients  were  instructed  to  take  Targretin  capsules  with  or immediately following a meal. In one clinical study, plasma bexarotene AUC and Cmax values were substantially higher following the administration of a fat-containing meal versus those following the administration of a glucose solution. Because safety and efficacy data from clinical trials are based upon administration with food, it is recommended that Targretin capsules be administered with food.

On the basis of the oxidative metabolism of bexarotene by cytochrome P450 3A4, grapefruit juice may theoretically lead to an increase in plasma bexarotene concentrations.

## Bioequivalence studies

One study  of  relative  bioavailability  of  Targretin  capsules  75  mg  and  a  bexarotene  suspension  has been  performed  in  12  healthy  volunteers.  As  usual  after  an  oral  administration  of  a  retinoid  great interpatient variations were observed both in Cmax and AUC levels. The results were as follows:

Clinical Efficacy

A total of 16 clinical studies were performed:

- -2 pivotal phase II-III studies in patients with CTCL
- -14  uncontrolled  open  studies  in  patients  with  non-CTCL  cancers  or  benign  diseases.  3  doseranging studies have already been discussed in the clinical pharmacology section and are not included in the table below.

NM = non-micronised

Dose-ranging  efficacy  studies  were  not  performed.  The  dose  regimen  for  phase  II-III  studies  was determined  with  regard  to  the  results  of  the  3  open-label,  dose  escalation  studies  (L1069-93-01, L1069-93-02  and  L1069-94-02)  in  patients  with  various  types  of  advanced  cancers.  See  the pharmacodynamics section.

## Main studies

The 2 pivotal phase II-III studies, L1069-23 and L1069-24, aimed to be historically controlled studies by a comparison to the natural evolution of patients with untreated refractory CTCL. The studies have followed International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) for the ethical conduct of clinical trials.

The  principal  objectives  of  both  studies  were  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  antitumour  efficacy  of bexarotene in patients with refractory or persistent early stage CTCL and in patients with refractory advanced  stage  CTCL.  Study  L1069-23  aimed  to  evaluate  two  different  daily  doses  of  Targretin capsules in patients with refractory or persistent early stage CTCL, but was not powered to compare the two response rates.

## General description

In L1069-23 study patients were to be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to low dose (6,5 mg/m 2 /day) or to high  dose  (650  mg/m 2 /day)  bexarotene.  In  L1069-24  study  all  patients  were  initially  treated  by bexarotene  650  mg/m 2 /day.  Because  of  a  high  number  of  dose-limiting  toxicities,  the  starting  dose

16

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

level was successively reduced in both studies by protocol amendments from 650 mg/m 2 /day to 500 mg/m 2 /day and finally to 300 mg/m 2 /day.

In addition, as patients on low dose bexarotene (6.5 mg/m 2 /day) appeared to progress more frequently than those on the higher dose group, the study protocol L1069-23 was amended to stop the inclusions in the low dose group and to include all patients in 300 mg/m 2 /day dose group. By the decision of the FDA, the randomisation  between  the  two  dose  groups  and  the  6,5  mg/m 2 /day  dose  group  were  reintroduced several months later.

The  planned  treatment  duration  was  at  least  16  weeks.  The  initial  daily  dose  could  have  been decreased to  200  mg/m 2 /day  and  than  to  100  mg/m 2 /day  or  temporarily  interrupted  (for  less  than  4 weeks) in case of toxicity. In case of no response after at least 8 weeks of therapy, the dose could have been  increased  to  400  mg/m 2 /day  or  more  if  well  tolerated.  Patients  with  the  initial  dose  of  6,5 mg/m 2 /day could have their dose increased to 300 mg/m 2 /day in case of no response after at least 8 weeks of therapy.

## Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Patients were to have met the following:

- a clinical diagnosis of CTCL (stage I to IIA in L1069-23 study, stage IIB to IVB in L1069-24 study) confirmed by a biopsy within 30 days prior to entry
- refractory to, or intolerant to, or have reached a response plateau for at least 6 months on at least two  prior  therapies  in  study  L1069-23  (PUVA,  UVB,  electron-beam  therapy,  photophereses, topical nitrogen mustard, BCNU, interferon, systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy). At least one of qualifying prior treatments must have been topical nitrogen mustard, BCNU or PUVA, UVB, or electron-beam therapy. Previous topical steroids and systemic retinoids did not qualify.
- refractory to at least one systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy in study L1069-24.
- Refractory CTCL : resistance to therapy due to lack of response of at least 50% improvement or progression on therapy after initial response.
- Intolerant  CTCL:  discontinuation  of  therapy  due  to  side  effects/toxicity,  whether  or  not  a response occurred.
- no antipruritic therapy or no change before and during the trial
- no  topical  CTCL  treatment  within  2  weeks,  no  PUVA  or  UVB  within  3  weeks,  no  EBT, photopheresis, systemic anticancer therapy or oral retinoid therapy for any indication within 4 weeks prior to study entry.
- systemic therapy of CTCL indicated
- a Karnofsky performance score &gt;60 and acceptable organ function (notably normal lipid levels)
- negative  HCG  test  and  effective  means  of  contraception  in  female  patients  of  child-bearing potential

The patients were followed up at week 2, week 4 and every 4 weeks during the treatment.

The patients were withdrawn from the study in case of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or other medically important event. The use of topical corticosteroids as qualifying prior therapy meeting eligibility  criteria  was  excluded  in  study  L1069-23  for  the  purpose  of  assuring  a  more  refractory population of patients for these studies. Topical steroids are commonly used in the very early stages of CTCL, often during the stages of disease prior to a diagnosis of CTCL. Because of the high frequency of  use,  especially  in  the  earliest  stages  of  CTCL,  if  topical  steroids  were  allowed  as  a  qualifying therapy the patient population would not have been as heavily treated or as refractory. Additionally, as a therapy often administered prior to a diagnosis of CTCL, there might have been some uncertainty about whether the topical steroid should be considered to have been administered for the treatment of CTCL or for some other, pre-CTCL diagnosed condition.

## Efficacy evaluation

Primary  efficacy  endpoints  were  defined  as  the  tumour  response  to  treatment  (clinical  complete response [CCR] + partial response [PR]) determined by:

Physician's Global Assessment of Clinical Condition (PGA) and

17

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity (CA)

A patient was considered a responder if he met response criteria for either the PGA or the CA, which designated  the  Primary  Endpoint  Classification  (PEC)  for  the  study.  The  highest  PEC  between  the PGA  and  CA  for  each  patient  was  used  for  response  calculation.  It  is  accepted  that  the  Primary Endpoint Classification (PEC) is not a standard approach to cancer therapy response rates. No attempt was made to blind Investigators performing clinical evaluations. However, the CA endpoint was based entirely on objective assessments of disease status. The CA endpoint was based on the five clinical signs of up to five index lesions representative of the patient's overall cutaneous disease. Precise serial measurements of all cutaneous lesions would not have been feasible. A total of 68% (103/152) of the patients enrolled had at least 20 (or considerably more) cutaneous CTCL lesions at baseline. The exact number of lesions was not recorded on the Case Report Form for these patients; precise and reliable tracking of multiple clinical signs for each of the lesions was considered unwieldy and impractical. The overall body surface area (BSA) involvement by CTCL is an independent and objective secondary efficacy endpoint. These data include all patients.

## Physician's Global Assessment (PGA )

The Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) assessed the overall extent of improvement/worsening of the patient's overall disease compared to the condition at entry (at baseline), including both index and non-index cutaneous lesions, clinically abnormal  lymph  nodes, and all other  CTCL  disease manifestations, if present.

Table 5: Grading of Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of Clinical Condition

| Grade                  | Description                                                                          | Response                         |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 0 Completely clear     | No evidence of disease; 100% improvement                                             | Clinical complete response (CCR) |
| 1 Almost clear         | Very significant clearance ( ≥ 90% to < 100%); only traces of disease remains        | Partial response (PR)            |
| 2 Marked improvement   | Significant improvement ( ≥ 75% to < 90%); some evidence of disease remains          | Partial response (PR)            |
| 3 Moderate Improvement | Intermediate between slight and marked improvement; ( ≥ 50% to < 75%)                | Partial response (PR)            |
| 4 Slight Improvement   | Some improvement ( ≥ 25% to < 50%); however, significant evidence of disease remains | Stable disease (SD)              |
| 5 No change            | Disease has not changed from baseline condition ( ± < 25%)                           | Stable disease (SD)              |
| 6 Worse                | Disease is worse than at baseline evaluation by ≥ 25% or more                        | Progressive disease (PD)         |

In addition, Complete Response (CR) was defined by the PGA grade 0 and the absence of CTCL on cutaneous biopsy of a clinically cured lesion.

An  improvement  or  worsening  in  the  PGA  grade  must  have  been  confirmed  by  two  consecutive observations over at least four weeks. The response to Targretin capsule treatment was classified as CR, CCR, PR, SD, or PD (if PD preceded in time a better response the patient would be classified as PD)

## Composite Assessment (CA) of Index Lesion Disease Severity

Up to five index lesions per patient were assessed and graded at each visit according on a 0-to-8 point scale  (0=no  lesion,  8=very  severe  lesion)  with  regard  to  scaling,  erythema,  plaque  elevation, hypo/hyper-pigmentation,  and  surface  area.  For  scaling,  erythema,  and  hypo/hyperpigmenation intermediate intervals 1, 3, 5 and 7 were added to serve as mid-points between the defined grades 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8. The surface area in square centimetres (multiplication of 2 longest perpendicular diameters) was converted to a 0-to-18 scale (see Appendix) in order to be incorporated to CA grade.

Summing all the grades for each index lesion generated a CA grade. CA grade at baseline was then divided  by  CA  grades  at  each  subsequent  visit  to  determine  the  CA  ratio.  CA  ratio &lt; 1.0  indicated improvement in disease and a ratio &gt; 1.0 indicated a worsening of disease.

The  definite  CTCL  response  to  treatment  according  to  the  CA  endpoint   was  calculated  by  the

18

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Marketing Authorisation Holder:

- -Complete Response (CR): CA ratio=0, no skin lesions, no clinically abnormal lymph nodes or visceral  tumours,  and  a  cutaneous  biopsy  documenting  absence  of  histology  signs  of  CTCL from a cleared lesion
- -Clinical  Complete  Response  (CCR):  CA  ratio=0  and  no  skin  lesions,  no  clinically  abnormal lymph nodes or visceral tumours.
- -Partial Response (PR): CA ratio ≤ 0.5 and less than 25% increase in the number or aggregate area of  clinically  abnormal  lymph  nodes,  cutaneous  tumours  or  visceral  disease  and  no  new pathologically abnormal lymph nodes or new visceral disease in an area documented to be free of disease within 14 days of entry in the study
- -Stable Disease (SD): If none of the previous response classifications accurately described the disease state, then the primary endpoint classification was SD.
- -Progressive Disease (PD): CA ratio ≥ 1.25, and ≥ 25% increase in the number or aggregate area of clinically abnormal lymph nodes, cutaneous tumours, known pathologically abnormal lymph nodes  or  known  visceral  disease;  or  a  new  cutaneous  tumour  or  new  pathologically  positive lymph node or new visceral disease in an area documented to be free of disease within 14 days of entry in the study

Confirmation by at least two assessments separated by at least four study weeks was required for a partial or complete response classification.

The Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) gives a global assessment of the improvement/worsening of the patient's overall disease compared to entry and can always be influenced by knowledge of the daily  dose  the  patients  received.  The  absence  of  placebo  makes  this  primary  endpoint  extremely subjective.  The  composite  Assessment  (CA)  of  Index  Lesion  Disease  Severity  is  a  more  objective measure of index lesion response to treatment. However, calculations of both CA grade and CA ratio were done by the Marketing Authorisation Holder. This signifies that the final response to treatment, according to the CA, was assessed by the Marketing Authorisation Holder and not by investigators. The investigators graded index lesions' signs and symptoms, and assessed CTCL body surface area (BSA), lymph nodes and visceral involvement.

Neither total number of skin lesions nor new lesions were assessed. The information concerning these 2  points  was  approximately obtained by BSA of all lesions, (« patient's palm = 1% of BSA ») and notion « &gt;20 lesions or &lt;20 lesions ».

## Secondary endpoints

The most important secondary end-points were:

- -Time to response: a time interval from day 1 to the first confirmed response
- -Duration of disease control: a time interval from first observation when the patient met response criteria  (CR, CCR or PR) to the time that the patient relapsed. Durability of response: day of relapse  (or  last  data  point  available  for  documenting  continuation  of  response)  minus  day  of onset  of  response,  plus  one  day.  A  patient  was  considered  to  relapse  if  he  first  responded  to treatment (CCR or PR) and then met the relapse criteria of a 25% or more worsening from the new baseline established at the time of response confirmation.
- -Time to disease progression: a time interval from day 1 to PD
- -The  response  (CCR+PR)  to  treatment  of  cutaneous  disease  (all  lesions)  determined  as  a percentage involvement of total body surface area (BSA): patient's palm = 1% of total BSA. BSA was determined for both patch and plaques lesions.

Index lesion photographs and drug concentration measurements at each visit.

## Laboratory evaluations

Blood specimens were obtained at baseline and every 4 weeks for fasting triglycerides, fasting HDL, LDL  and total cholesterol, liver function tests, thyroid hormones, serum amylase, creatine phosphokinase and blood coagulation parameters, complete blood count. The NCI common toxicity criteria were used to classify laboratory abnormalities.

Slit-lamp eye examination every 12 weeks was added by protocol amendment.

## Statistical analysis

The expected objective response of untreated, refractory CTCL was considered 0%. Five percent was used  as  the  theoretical  maximum  response  rate.  The  success  was  defined  by  a  CCR+PR ∃ 20% confirmed by at least 2  assessments separated  by  4  weeks (significance level=0,05,  historic  control response rate=0,05 and alternative (Targretin) response rate=0,20). Sample size calculations provided that at least 30 patients would be required in each dose group to yield a 95% confidence interval for the true response rate of 5% to 35%. The study L1069-23 in patients with early stage CTCL was not powered to compare the two response rates by inferential statistics.

Study design of the study L1069-23 was changed twice: to one dose group with no randomisation and then again to two dose groups.

The  definition  of  'refractory'  was  prospectively  defined  before  the  beginning  of  the  trials.  Patient enrolment commenced under Version 2 of the protocols, which included this definition. A patient who never responded to a given therapy might be characterised as 'primarily' refractory to that therapy; a patient  who  initially  responded  and  then  progressed  on  a  given  therapy,  might  be  characterised  as 'secondarily' refractory to that therapy.

For the total of 322 refractory prior therapies in both studies, 82% (264/322) were primarily refractory and only 18% (58/322) were secondarily refractory. A new, non-protocol-specified analysis included only  patients  primarily  refractory  to  at  least  one  systemic  CTCL  therapy.  Patients  secondarily refractory, intolerant, or having had a response plateau to prior therapy were not analysed.

These selection criteria were applied to 193 patients, included in both studies.  These criteria produced a  subset  of  117  patients,  including  24  patients  from  the  early  stage  study  and  93  patients  from  the advanced stage study.

Although  the  indication  «refractory  CTCL»  represents  a  heterogeneous  group  of  T-cell  skin malignancies including classic Mycosis Fungoides and Sézary syndrome as the most common forms, this can be accepted.

In  the  recent  period  aggressive  CTCL  forms  have  become  better  individualised,  and  it  might  be possible nowadays to exclude these patients from enrolment because they need different, frequently more aggressive treatment. However, this distinction was probably impossible when the studies were realised.

In  addition  it  might  be  impossible  to  enrol  sufficient  patients  to  power  a  study  by  individual  subclassification  variants  of  CTCL.  The  incidence  of  CTCL  in  Europe  has  been  estimated  to  be  about 1,200 patients per year.   The  scarcity of  clinical  subjects  has  obvious  practical  implications  for  the clinical development programme.

## Descriptions of techniques used

Point and interval estimation was the primary method for analysis. Summary statistics were provided for continuous variables. Frequency distribution and percent were presented for discrete variables.

For the purpose of analysis, patients have been grouped in three initial dose groups: 6.5 mg/m 2 /day 300 mg/m 2 /day &gt;300 mg/m 2 /day

## Study populations

In study L1069-23 the age of the patients ranged from 24-62 years, median 62, 82% were white and 64% male. The majority, 59%, had stage IB disease with only one patient with stage IIB who had 20 cutaneous tumours. The mean duration of the disease was over 13 years. Previous treatments included irradiation  97%,  systemic  therapy  59%,  topical  or  local  therapy  95%.  The  most  common  previous systemic therapy was interferon, 38%.

20

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In study L1069-24 patients were 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of stage IIB-IVB CTCL confirmed by a lesion biopsy within 30 days of entry and no central nervous systems involvement. They were also to have been refractory to at least one systemic anticancer therapy for CTCL.

## Study L1069-24

Ninety-four patients with advanced stage CTCL, refractory to at least one systemic therapy for CTCL were enrolled. For the purpose of analysis, patients were grouped in two dose groups:

300 mg/m²/day (N=56)

&gt;300 mg/m²/day (N=38).

The study was not statistically powered to test for a difference in response rate between an initial dose of 300 mg/m²/day and &gt;300 mg/m²/day.

The majority of patients included belonged to the stages IIB or III (skin involvement with tumours or erythroderma, no specific lymph node or visceral involvement).

96% (90/94) of all enrolled patients were considered refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy for CTCL. The median number of therapies for the 300 mg/m²/day initial dose group was 3 (range 06). One patient had no systemic therapy (protocol deviation).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on the 95% confidence intervals, the response rates were not statistically different for the 300 mg/m²/day and &gt;300mg/m2/day groups for any parameter (PGA, CA, PEC). However, the study was not powered to test the difference between the two doses.

Most patients treated with &gt;300 mg/m²/day had serial dose reductions or temporary interruptions of treatment.

## Studies L1069-23 and L1069-24

## Data on lymph nodes

Out  of  152  patients,  84  patients  were  on  300 mg/m 2 /day,  35%  (29/84)  had  at  least  one  clinically abnormal lymph node at baseline, 48% (14/29) responded, including 24% (7/29) of patients who had clinical complete resolution of all nodes present at baseline.

## Data on cutaneous tumours

Out  of  152  patients,  84  patients  were  on  300 mg/m 2 /day,  19%  (16/84)  had  at  least  one  cutaneous tumour at baseline, 25% (4/16) of patients responded, including 6% (1/16) of patients who had clinical complete resolution out of all cutaneous tumours present at baseline.

## Data on visceral involvement:

The clinical trial data regarding visceral involvement are too sparse to allow any conclusions about the possible efficacy of Targretin capsules regarding visceral disease.

## Efficacy response

## Response rates

Initially only the results for 152 patients were initially provided, as described above. Later on in the procedure the Marketing Authorisation Holder has analysed 193 patients included in both studies; 117 patients refractory to at least 1 systemic treatment were analysed, 24 early stage and 93 advanced stage CTCL patients. Of the 93  advanced  stage  patients  refractory  to  at  least  one  systemic  treatment,  61 were  treated  at  the  recommended  posology  of  a  300  mg/m²/day  (32  patients  were  treated  at  doses higher than 300 mg/m²/day). The main characteristics of these patients are:

- -Median age of 60 years
- -37.7% stage IIB, 31.1% stage III, 24.6% stage IVA and 6.6% stage IVB
- -Median duration of CTCL of 8.9 years (range 0.7 to 31 years)
- -overall BSA involvement by CTCL of 28%
- -74% of patients had at least 20 discrete cutaneous CTCL lesions
- -56% had at least one clinically abnormal lymph node at baseline; for those patients, the median number of nodes was three (range 1 to 13)
- -31% had at least one cutaneous tumour; for those patients, the median number of tumours was three (range one to 34)
- -23% of patients had at least one pathologically positive lymph node
- -3.3% (2 patients) had at least one site of visceral involvement
- -Median number of prior systemic CTCL therapies was two (range one to six);
- -The most frequent prior systemic therapy used was interferon, used by 59% of patients; the next most common systemic therapies were methotrexate (43%), combination chemotherapy (33%), and photopheresis (26%).
- -The  most  common  therapies  to  which  the  patients  were  refractory  were  interferon  (52%  of patients), methotrexate (33%), and photopheresis (20%)
- -66% of patients had been unresponsive (refractory) to all prior systemic CTCL therapies
- -The median time on study was 19.9 weeks (range 2.0 to 117.7 weeks).
- -The most common, the last/most recent, and the mean dose levels were 300 mg/m²/day
- -The most common primary reasons for withdrawal were progressive disease (51% of patients), followed by adverse event (13%), administrative (11%), and partial response (8%)
- -Dose modifications: there was no reduction of dose in 54% of patients; 39% of patients required temporary suspension of treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  overall  response  rates  (CCR  +  PR)  were  31%  (CA)  and  51%  (PGA).  The  clinical  complete response rates were 6.6% by CA, 3.3% for PGA. The projected median time to progression was 16.1 weeks for CA. Responses were observed across all advanced stages of disease: stage IIB: 43% (10/23 patients), stage III: 16% (3/19 patients), stage IVA : 33% (5/15 patients) and stage IVB : 1/4 patients.

For the 30 patients in the SPC data set with at least one pre-existing clinically abnormal lymph node, 30% (9 patients) had at least 50% sustained improvement in the number of nodes and/or aggregate nodal area. Seven patients had at least transient complete resolution of all lymph nodes.

For  the  14  patients  in  the  SPC  data  set  with  at  least  one  pre-existing  cutaneous  tumour,  21%  (3 patients) had at least 50% sustained improvement in the number of tumours and/or aggregate volume of tumours. One patient had CCR, one patient had 97% reduction in aggregate tumour volume, and one patient experienced a 69% reduction in tumour volume.

Out of 24 early stage CTCL patients refractory to at least one systemic therapy, 9 were treated with the recommended posology; the response rate for these patients was 67% (6/9 patients).

The responses were observed mostly in patients with stage IIB and IVA (cutaneous patches, plaques, and  tumours,  normal  or  abnormal  lymph  nodes  and  no  visceral  involvement).  The  most  frequently given daily dose was 300 mg/m2/day; this dose should be adapted according to its safety profile in each patient.

## Secondary end-points

The secondary end-points time to relapse and time to progression of non-responders are difficult to interpret because of the relatively small number of patients per CTCL stage . Only the median BSA involvement  (patch  +  plaque)  by  CTCL  can  be  taken  into  account  for  the  efficacy  evaluation. Treatment with Targretin seems to decrease the BSA of CTCL skin lesions with approximately 10% (-9.5% to -16.3%). This response is evaluated in only 50% of patients treated.

## Duration of treatment at recommended posology

Out of 193 patients treated, for 109 patients in the 300 mg/m 2 /day dose group, the median duration of treatment was 19.7 weeks (range 0.4 to 84.6 weeks) and for 53 patients in the &gt;300 mg/m 2 /day dose it was 26.7 weeks (range 0.6 to 118 weeks).

## Clinical studies in special populations

There  were  no  formal  studies  in  special  patient  populations.  Retrospective  data  are  available  from studies in patients with advanced cancer or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. No relationship in

23

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the kinetics between age (adults compared to the elderly), sex or ethnic origin was studied.  No studies have been performed in children.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Choice of dose

The  finally  recommended  dose  (300 mg/m 2 /day  or  516  mg/day)  was  empirically  decided , by decreasing  the  initial  high  dose  due  to  toxicity.  This  dose  still  seems  too  high  compared  to  other known retinoids. It should be noted that daily dose for isotretinoin should not exceed 1 mg/kg/day and for  etretinate  75  mg/day.  The  average  daily  dose  in  the  two  studies  was  situated  around  200 mg/m 2 /day. Moreover, no clinical data exist on one versus two daily doses in CTCL patients.

However, the dose recommendation can be accepted, provided that this dose is adapted according to the  safety  profile  in  each  individual  patient  to  obtain  the  most  acceptable  benefit/risk  ratio.  This  is reflected in the SPC (see section 4.2 Posology and method of administration) .

## Efficacy results

No comparative study was provided. The two pivotal studies were open-label, phase II-III studies in patients  with  early  stage  CTCL,  and  in  patients  with  advanced  stage  CTCL.  Selected  population comprised refractory, resistant or intolerant patients, or patients progressing after initial response to 1 or  2  previous  treatments.  Primary efficacy variable  was tumour response to treatment, evaluated by one subjective endpoint (Physicians Global Assessment of clinical condition, PGA) and by one more objective endpoint (Composite Assessment of index lesion disease severity, CA). On the recommended posology (300 mg/m 2 /day), the objective response rate was 36% in early stage CTCL patients, and 27% in advanced stage CTCL patients.  Only the results for 152 patients were initially provided.

Later on in the procedure the Marketing Authorisation Holder has analysed 193 patients included in both studies; 117 patients refractory to at least 1 systemic treatment were analysed, 24 early stage and 93 advanced stage CTCL patients. The objective response rates in these patients (CA=34%) appears comparable to those observed in the initial submission.

## Comparison of response rates

The Marketing Authorisation Holder has compared the response rates of advanced stage patients to response rates in the same patients at an earlier stage of the disease (within-patient controls) and to historical controls.

## Historical controls

One  older  publication  has  been  analysed  (Bunn  et  al,  Ann  Intern  Med,  1994;121:592-602).  The response rates were the following (only monotherapy):

- interferon : CR+PR=55%, (CR=17%)
- other retinoids: CR+PR=58% (CR=19%)

Additional analysis of recently published literature revealed 11 monotherapy studies in patients with all clinical stages of CTCL and frequently not refractory to previous treatments:

- liposomal doxorubicin: CR+PR=83%, (CR=67%)
- interferon : CR+PR=62%, (CR=36%)
- trimetrexate: CR+PR=53%, (CR=6%)

Comparison  to  historical  controls  appears  difficult  because  the  patients  treated  by  Targretin  were refractory  to  at  least  one  systemic  treatment.  Taking  into  account  that  the  response  rates  in  the literature were probably evaluated by the endpoints like PGA, it can be assumed that the efficacy of Targretin  (300  mg/m²/day:  CR+PR=  31%  (CA)  or  51%  (PGA),  CR=7%)  is  comparable  to  that  of interferon and of other retinoids. However, the complete responses to Targretin are lower than those observed with other treatments.

24

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Within-patient controls

The response to Targretin was compared to the best response to prior CTCL therapies in 93 advanced stage  CTCL  patients  refractory  to  at  least  one  systemic  treatment.  The  responses  to  these  prior therapies  were  assessed  by  the  PGA  endpoint  (subjective  investigator's  judgement)  in  case  report forms.

The most frequent previous systemic treatments were:

- single agent chemotherapy (different agents) (78 patients, CR+PR=14.1%), followed by
- interferon (59 patients, CR+PR=15.3%),
- combination chemotherapy (different regimens)(49 patients, CR+PR=36.7%) and
- other retinoids (29 patients, CR+PR=17.2%).

The  overall  response  rate  to  Targretin  was  better  than  the  response  rates  to  all  previous  systemic therapies.  The  complete  response  to  Targretin  was  lower  than  that  obtained  by  other  retinoids  and combination chemotherapy.

The Marketing Authorisation Holder has provided data on the patients' response to prior topical and irradiation CTCL therapies (within-patient controls).

For prior topical therapies the overall response rates to Targretin exceeded the response rates to all prior topical therapies except topical retinoids (3 patients).

For  prior  irradiation  therapies:  overall  response  rates  to  Targretin  (31%)  were  exceeded  by  the response rate for electron beam therapy (72%) and radiotherapy (38%). The response rate to Targretin was superior to those for photopheresis (30%) and PUVA (24%). The low response rates to topical therapy and PUVA therapy are understandable due to advanced stage and refractory character of the disease.

## Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

Safety data have been reported from 2 phase II-III clinical studies of 152 CTCL patients and from 9 open phase I-II, II and II-III clinical studies with 352 non-CTCL patients.

Safety data for 109 CTCL patients treated at the recommended posology have been analysed, based on a duration of exposure with a median of 19.7 weeks (range 3 days to 84.6 weeks).

A total of 47% (91/193) of all enrolled CTCL patients received at least 24 weeks of Targretin capsule therapy. These 91 patients were treated for a median of 308 days (mean 344 days, range 172 to 826 days). 49/91 patients were treated at the recommended posology. Comparison of the safety profile for these  49  patients  to  the  safety  profile  for  all  patients  at  the  recommended  posology  regardless  of treatment  duration  shows  that  many  events  are  modestly  higher  for  patients  treated  more  than  24 weeks.

The Four-Month Safety Update data, based on 810 patients treated with Targretin capsules entered into  Ligand's  database  as  of  30  July  1999,  further  confirm  that  Targretin  capsules  were  generally acceptably tolerated.

Hyperlipidemia,  especially  hypertriglyceridemia,  was  the  most  common  adverse  event  reported  in association  with  Targretin  capsule  therapy.  For  the  84  CTCL  patients  in  the  300  mg/m2/day  initial dose group in the MAA submission database, 79% of patients had at least one reported adverse event of hyperlipemia. The severity of hypertriglyceridemia was reduced as the studies progressed and there were no subsequent episodes of pancreatitis following the institution of protocol amendments reducing the  initial  dose  level  for  the  higher  dose  treatment  arm  and  instituting  strict  guidelines  for  the monitoring and management of hyperlipidemia to reduce the risk of additional cases of pancreatitis. The modifications of dose regimen and the monitoring and management guidelines that effected this improvement in triglyceride levels in the clinical trials are reflected in the guidelines proposed in the SPC (See section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use ).

The hypothyroidism related to Targretin therapy was easily detected and managed, generally mildly symptomatic until treated, promptly reversible with discontinuation of Targretin capsule therapy, and was not associated with clinical sequelae. Recommendations for the monitoring of thyroid function have been included in the SPC (See section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use ).

The mechanism for diarrhoea observed in the clinical trials of Targretin is unknown.  The incidence of drug-related  diarrhoea  was  low  and  was  directly  related  to  initial  dose  level,  but  did  not  appear  to increase  substantially  until  the  dose  level  exceeded  the  recommended  posology  of  300  mg/m2/day. Most adverse events of diarrhoea were only mild to moderate in severity. Only 0.7% (1/152) of CTCL patients withdrew from the studies for a primary reason of an adverse event of drug-related diarrhoea. DLTs  of  diarrhoea  were  uncommon,  dose-related,  did  not  appear  to  recur  after  downward  dose adjustments,  and  rarely  caused  withdrawal  from  study.  Diarrhoea  was  reported  as  a  DLT  in  1.2% (1/84)  of  patients  in  the  300  mg/m2/day  initial  dose  group.  No  CTCL  patient  treated  at  the recommended posology experienced a serious adverse event of diarrhoea.

Diarrhoea has been reported as an adverse event in studies of other retinoids, including tretinoin and etretinate.

Mortality from serious coagulopathy was noted in preclinical studies with an oil-based formulation. Dose-limiting  toxicities  consisting  of  haemorrhage  or  events  associated  with  coagulation  parameter alterations were rare (2.0%) in CTCL patients and occurred only in the &gt;300 mg/m2/day initial dose group. Serious adverse events of this nature were rare (2.0%) in CTCL patients and each was judged to  be  not  related  to  Targretin  capsule  therapy either by the Investigator  or  upon independent expert review. Determination of haemoglobin should be obtained at baseline, weekly during the first month and  then  monthly  thereafter.  Decreases  of  haemoglobin  should  be  managed  according  to  current medical practice. This has been reflected in the SPC (see section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use ).

## Serious adverse advents

Among all CTCL patients included in the safety update fatal serious adverse events judged to be at least possibly related to study drug were reported in 6.7% (13/193) of patients with CTCL. The only serious adverse events judged related to study drug that occurred in more than one CTCL patient were pancreatitis, pruritus, and pain.

In  the  main  clinical  trials  serious  adverse  events  considered  to  be  drug  related,  or  possibly  related, occurred  in  9/152  (6%)  of  patients  with  pancreatitis  occurring  in  four  patients  in  association  with elevated plasma triglycerides. Pancreatitis was the main serious adverse event related to hyperlipemia. There  were  no  further  events  of  pancreatitis  subsequent  to  the  guidelines  for  the  monitoring  and management of hyperlipemia, a period of over 12 months. These guidelines are included in the SPC (See section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use ).

Other  serious  adverse  events  included  cholestatic  jaundice  and  bilirubinaemia.  Adverse  events  and laboratory  abnormalities  related  to  the  liver  were  not  common  and  were  nearly  exclusively  mild  to moderate in severity in the studies of Targretin capsules in CTCL. Perhaps the best indication of the level  of  clinical  significance  of  liver  function  test  abnormalities  for  patients  in  the  300  mg/m²/day initial  dose  group was that there was only one patient (1.2%) withdrawn primarily for liver toxicity (hyperbilirubinemia), and there were no dose-limiting liver toxicities. However, recommendations for the monitoring of hepatic function have been included in the SPC (see section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use ) .

27

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Also seen were diarrhoea, dehydration, herpes zoster, fever, pruritis and chest pain. Seven of the nine patients  recovered.  One  patient  died.  A  second  died  from  Pneumocystis  carinii  pneumonia  after developing  cholestatic  jaundice  and  pancreatitis  at  which  time  bexarotene  was  stopped.  For  this second patient the fatal event was not considered related to the study drug by the investigator. It is not possible to  detect  from  the  history  given  as  to  whether  drug  induced  leucopenia  contributed  to  this death, but this seems unlikely as death occurred 80 days after discontinuation of bexarotene.

Because  of  preclinical  findings  of  posterior  subcapsular  cataracts  in  rats  and dogs,  slit-lamp examinations were added to the trial protocols after they started. A high prevalence was noted in the limited pre-study data of 66% for CTCL patients and 58% for non-CTCL patients and the incidence of new cataract formation was 5.2%. Given the high prevalence and natural rate of cataract formation in the  older  patient  population  represented  in  the  clinical  studies,  there  was  no  apparent  association between the incidence of lens opacity formation and Targretin capsule administration in the clinical studies.  However,  an  effect  of  long-term  bexarotene  treatment  on  cataract  formation  has  not  been excluded  and  this  has  been  reflected  in  the  SPC  (see  section  4.4 Special  warnings  and  special precautions  for  use ).  The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  has  agreed  to  closely  monitor  the occurrence of cataract formation, particularly during long term treatment.

Retinoids  may cause  other  types  of  visual  impairment  than  cataract . It  is  unknown  at  this  time  the degree to which these visual abnormalities may be attributable and selective to RAR binding effects. The Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  has  committed  to  closely  monitor  visual  abnormalities.  In  the non-CTCL  oncology  patients  serious  adverse  events  occurred  in  11/352  (3.1%)  of  the  patients. Pancreatitis occurred in three, hypercalcaemia, pneumonia, and dehydration occurred in two patients each.  Other  serious  adverse  events  were  fever,  mucous  membrane  disorder,  diarrhoea,  melaena, vomiting, anaemia, increased coagulation time, dyspnoea, confusion, conjunctivitis and haematuria.

## Deaths

In study L1069-24 the median duration of time in the study was seven months with a further median five  months  follow  up  during  which  there  were  17  deaths  in  the  107  patients  (94  in  the  original database and a further 13 enrolled after the database cut off). Sixteen of the deaths were considered not related  or  probably  not  related  by  the  investigator  to  bexarotene.  One  death  from  bleeding, haemorrhage, coagulopathy and liver failure was considered possibly related.

There were only three deaths among CTCL patients subsequent to the ISS and all were judged to be not related to study medication by the Investigator.

In the non-CTCL oncology patients two deaths in the 352 patients receiving bexarotene monotherapy were  considered  treatment  related.  One  patient  had  a  prolonged  prothrombin  time  and  died  of  a subdural haematoma.  The  second  patient  died  of acute pancreatitis associated with elevated triglycerides and continued alcohol abuse.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Adverse events leading to dose reduction or discontinuation in at least two patients were hyperlipidaemia, neutropenia/leucopenia, diarrhoea, fatigue/lethargy, hypothyroidism, headache, liver function  test  abnormalities,  rash,  pancreatitis,  nausea,  anaemia,  allergic  reaction,  muscle  spasm, pneumonia and confusion.

## Laboratory findings

In  the  main  efficacy  trial,  study  L1069-24,  there  was  a  marked  fall  in  TSH  concentrations  from  a median of 1.60 µ U/ml (n=85) at baseline to 0.16 µ U/ml at 2-4 weeks (n=39) and 0.37 µ U/ml at 12-16 weeks  (n=27).  Changes  in  total  thyroxine  paralleled  those  of  TSH.  In  the  same  study  there  were altered  lipid,  hepatic  and  haematology  parameters.  Abnormalities  in  aspartate  transaminase,  with  a increase from normal to above the normal range, occurred in 21% of patients at 2-4 weeks in the 300 mg/m 2 /day group and 19% in the &gt;300 mg/m 2 /day.  Triglyceride  concentrations  became  elevated  or worsened in 64% of patients (n=94), 28 with concentrations 2.5-5 times the upper limit of normal, 23 with 5-10 times, and nine with &gt;10 times the upper limit. Cholesterol concentrations became elevated or worsened with treatment in 48% of patients, with 21 in the range 7.8-10.3 mmol/l, 14 in the range 10.3-12.9 mmol/l and 13 above 12.9 mmol/l. Leucopenia was common with 30% having a decrease in total leucocyte count and 35% a decrease in neutrophil count to below the normal range by week 4 of treatment.  This  effect  on  the  white  count  persisted  with  treatment.  There  was  also  a  fall  in  median haemoglobin from 13.2 g/dl at baseline to 12.1 g/dl at 12-16 weeks.

28

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  most  common  laboratory  toxicities  (hyperlipidemia,  hypothyroidism  and,  less  frequently, leucopenia) were often asymptomatic, easily monitored and managed with well-tolerated concomitant medications, rarely required treatment discontinuation, reversible upon discontinuation of therapy, and resulted in no clinical sequelae except for pancreatitis (and all four CTCL patients with pancreatitis recovered). Only 2.4% (2/84) of patients at the 300 mg/m²/day initial dose group required Targretin capsules  treatment  discontinuation  because  of  hypertriglyceridemia,  and  no  patients  at  this  dose required withdrawal from study for a primary reason of hypothyroidism or leucopenia.

## Safety in special populations

## Patients with diabetes mellitus

Caution should be exercised when administering Targretin capsules in patients using insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion (e.g. sulfonylureas), or insulin-sensitisers (e.g. thiazolidinediones). Based on the known mechanism of action, Targretin capsules  may potentially enhance the action of these agents, resulting in hypoglycaemia. No cases of hypoglycaemia associated with the use of Targretin capsules as monotherapy have been reported.

## Other special populations

No specific information is available.

The clinical safety and effectiveness of bexarotene in the paediatric population (below 18 years of age) have not been studied and this product should not be used in a paediatric population until further data become available.

In view of the limited data, patients with renal insufficiency should be monitored carefully while on Targretin  capsule  therapy.  As  patients  with  hepatic  insufficiency  may  theoretically  have  altered bexarotene pharmacokinetics, they should be monitored carefully while on Targretin capsule therapy

## Discussion on clinical safety

In the initial submission, the safety data were presented from 2 CTCL studies (152 patients) and from 9 non-CTCL studies (352 patients). Only 84 CTCL patients and 56 non-CTCL patients were treated with the proposed posology (300 mg/m 2 /day).

Later on in the procedure the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted the safety data collected from 2 CTCL studies (193 patients) and from 9 non-CTCL studies (420 patients); 109 CTCL patients and 57 non-CTCL patients were treated by the recommended posology (300 mg/m 2 /day).

Targretin safety profile appears comparable to that of other retinoid drugs, except for leucopenia and hypothyroidism (specific RXR- related effect of Targretin). 97.4% of CTCL patients, and 84.8% of non-CTCL patients experienced drug-related adverse events. The most frequent ones in CTCL patients were hyperlipemia (73%), hypercholesterolemia (37%), hypothyroidism (35%), exfoliative dermatitis + rash (34%), asthenia (28%), leucopenia (28%), headache (26%) and diarrhoea (12%). The majority of these events were dose and duration dependent, requiring a close monitoring during treatment, dose adaptations  and/or  specific  treatment  (antilipemic  therapy,  thyroid  hormones  replacement).  6.7%  of CTCL and 3.1% non-CTCL patients had drug-related serious adverse events. The most frequent drugrelated serious adverse events was pancreatitis, secondary to hypertriglyceridemia (12/613 cases); all patients recovered except one who died. There were no further event of pancreatitis subsequent to the introduction of guidelines for the monitoring and management of hyperlipemia.

Whilst the most common toxicities associated with Targretin capsule therapy in patients with CTCL (i.e., hypertriglyceridemia, hypothyroidism, and less frequently, neutropenia) often warranted concurrent pharmacological intervention, the required concomitant therapies were easily administered and monitored.  These toxicities were reversible upon Targretin capsule dose reduction, suspension or discontinuation. Guidance for managing these adverse events is provided in the SPC (see section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use ).

Because of dose-related posterior subcapsular cataracts in rats and dogs, slit-lamp examinations were added to the clinical trial protocols after they started. A high prevalence of cataracts was noted in the limited pre-study data of 66% CTCL and 58% non-CTCL patients and the incidence of new cataract formation  was  5.7%.  However  the  follow-up  was  too  short  and  an  effect  of  long-term  bexarotene treatment on cataract formation has not been excluded and will be closely monitored by the Marketing Authorisation  Holder.  A  close  monitoring  of  liver  function  tests,  white  blood  cells,  lipids,  thyroid

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hormones level is recommended in the SPC (see section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use) .

The safety data of long term treatment (&gt; 24 weeks) reveals no new or substantially different safety issues.

Except  for  hyperlipidemia,  adverse  events  were  rarely  dose-limiting  for  patients  treated  at  the recommended  posology.  For  the  84  patients  in  this  initial  dose  group  in  the  MAA  database, hypertriglyceridemia/hypercholesterolemia was dose-limiting for 39% (33/84) patients and neutropenia/leucopenia  was  dose-limiting  for  3.6%  (3/84)  of  patients.  No  other  single  toxicity  was dose-limiting for more than two patients (2.4%).

Targretin capsule therapy at the recommended posology for patients with CTCL carries substantially less  mucocutaneous  and  nail  toxicity  and  less  alopecia  than  other  non-RXR-selective  retinoids. Targretin capsules may also cause less myalgias and arthralgias. Lipid elevations are observed with both  RAR  and  RXR-selective  retinoids.  Central  hypothyroidism  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  leucopenia were reported only for Targretin capsules and appear to be RXR-related effects.

In  conclusion,  the  safety  profile  of  Targretin  is  close  to  other  retinoids,  except  for  leucopenia  and hypothyroidism. The most common treatment-related adverse events were duration dependent.

## 5. Overall conclusion and benefit-risk assessment

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance  of  the  product  have  been  investigated  and  are  controlled  in  a  satisfactory  way. Information  has  been  provided  in  the  dossier  demonstrating  that  the  medicinal  product  is  made  in compliance  with  the  CPMP  Note  for  Guidance  on  minimising  the  risk  of  transmitting  animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via medicinal products.

## Pre-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Bexarotene  is  a  new  synthetic  retinoid  that  binds  selectively  to  three  RXR  receptors.  Overall,  the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that retinoids, including RXR-selective ligands, can modulate T-cell biology, which can have relevance for a possible mechanism of action of bexarotene in CTCL.

Bexarotene was bioavailable following oral administration in both test species. Systemic exposure was decreased upon repeat dosing, which could be attributed to metabolic enzyme induction.

In repeated dose-toxicity studies conducted in rats and in dogs, the target organs of bexarotene were eyes,  liver,  adrenals  and  haematological  parameters.  In  rats,  bexarotene  induced  hyperkeratosis  and acanthosis of the oesophagus and the non-glandular stomach and follicular atrophy and acanthosis of the skin.

Mortality was observed in both species. Hyperkeratosis of the oesophagus was probably the cause of gavage-related injury leading to an increase of the mortality in treated rats; however, the mechanism of death was not clearly elucidated in treated dogs.

Bexarotene was cataractogenic at dosages comparable to human  exposition. The Marketing Authorisation Holder will closely monitor this effect

Bexarotene is teratogenic and embryotoxic at dosages comparable to human exposition. Fertility and peri-  and  post-natal  effects  of  bexarotene  were  not  evaluated.  The  use  of  bexarotene  has  to  be contraindicated during pregnancy. Adequate birth-control measures have to be employed by women of childbearing potential.

Bexarotene is not mutagenic. Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Efficacy

The final recommended dose (300 mg/m 2 /day or 516 mg/day) was empirically decided , by decreasing the initial high dose due to toxicity. This dose still seems too high compared to other known retinoids. However, the dose recommendation can be accepted, provided that this dose is adapted according to the safety profile in each individual patient to obtain the most acceptable benefit/risk ratio.

No comparative study was provided. The two pivotal studies were open-label, phase II-III studies in patients  with  early  stage  CTCL,  and  in  patients  with  advanced  stage  CTCL.  Selected  population comprised refractory, resistant or intolerant patients, or patients progressing after initial response to 1 or  2  previous  treatments.  Primary efficacy variable  was tumour response to treatment, evaluated by one subjective endpoint (Physicians Global Assessment of clinical condition, PGA) and by one more objective endpoint (Composite Assessment of index lesion disease severity, CA).

The Marketing Authorisation Holder has analysed 193 patients included in both studies; 117 patients refractory to at least 1 systemic treatment were analysed, 24 early stage and 93 advanced stage CTCL patients. The objective response rate in these patients (CA) was 34%.

It  can  be  assumed  that  the  efficacy  of  Targretin  is  comparable  to  that  of  interferon  and  of  other retinoids in the studied population of patients refractory to at least one systemic treatment. However, the complete responses to Targretin are lower than those observed with other treatments.

For prior irradiation therapies: overall response rates to Targretin (31%) was lower than the response rate  for  electron  beam  therapy  (72%)  and  radiotherapy  (38%).  The  response  rate  to  Targretin  was superior to those for photopheresis (30%) and PUVA (24%).

No formal studies to investigate the effects of other substances on bexarotene have been conducted. There  are  indications  that  bexarotene  may  induce  CYP3A4.  Therefore,  repeated  administration  of bexarotene may increase the rate of metabolism and reduce plasma concentrations of other substances metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4.

There were no formal studies in special patient populations.

## Safety

Whilst the most common toxicities associated with Targretin capsule therapy in patients with CTCL (i.e., hypertriglyceridemia, hypothyroidism, and less frequently, neutropenia) often warranted concurrent pharmacological intervention, the required concomitant therapies were easily administered and monitored. These toxicities were reversible upon Targretin capsule dose reduction, suspension or discontinuation.

Because of dose-related posterior subcapsular cataracts in rats and dogs, slit-lamp examinations were added to the clinical trial protocols after they started. A high prevalence of cataracts was noted in the limited pre-study data of 66% CTCL and 58% non-CTCL patients and the incidence of new cataract formation  was  5.7%.  However  the  follow-up  was  too  short  and  an  effect  of  long-term  bexarotene treatment on cataract formation has not been excluded and will be closely monitored by the Marketing Authorisation  Holder.  A  close  monitoring  of  liver  function  tests,  white  blood  cells,  lipids,  thyroid hormones level is adequately addressed in section 4.4 of the SPC.

The safety data of long term treatment (&gt; 24 weeks) reveals no new or substantially different safety issues.

Caution should be exercised when administering Targretin capsules in patients using insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion, or insulin-sensitisers. Based on the known mechanism of action, Targretin capsules may potentially enhance the action of these agents, resulting in hypoglycaemia.

In  conclusion,  the  safety  profile  of  Targretin  is  close  to  other  retinoids,  except  for  leucopenia  and hypothyroidism. The most common treatment-related adverse events were duration dependent.

## Benefit/risk assessment

Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus that  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  Targretin  in  the  treatment  of  skin  manifestations  of  advanced  stage CTCL  patients refractory to at least one systemic treatment was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the Marketing Authorisation.
