## Introduction

On October 12 2015, the MAH submitted the final clinical study report for study NO1375, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical clinical overview has also been provided.

## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study NO1375 is a stand alone study.

## 1.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The study medication was provided as levetiracetam (LEV) 250 mg and 500mg tablets.

## 1.3. Clinical aspects

## 1.3.1. Description of the study

## Title:

'An open-label, randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Levetiracetam used as monotherapy in newly or recently diagnosed epilepsy patients aged older than or equal to 16 years with partial seizures'

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

Objective(s):TheprimaryobjectiveofN01375wastoevaluatetheefficacyoflevetiracetam (LEV) used asmonotherapy,with efficacymeasured as6-monthseizurefreedom at thefinal evaluated dose in the LEV 1000 to 2000mg/day group, in subjects with newly or recently diagnosedepilepsy.

The secondary objectives of this study were the following:

- Toevaluate the1-yearefficacyof LEVused asmonotherapy atthefinal evaluated dosein the LEV 1000mg/dayto 2000mg/daygroup
- To evaluate the efficacy of LEV used as monotherapy in subjects in the LEV 3000mg/day group
- To evaluate the long-term safety of LEV used as monotherapy

## Study design

Methodology:N01375wasdesigned as aPhase 3,open-label,randomized,2-arm,multicenter studyfor LEV monotherapy.After subjectswere screened atVisit 1,eligible subjects were randomized in a 6:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups: LEV 1000 to 2000mg/day or LEV 3000mg/day.All subjects started LEV treatment at 1000mg/dayregardless of the treatment group.

RegardlessofthefrequencyofseizuresduringtheStabilizationPeriod,subjectswereallowedto enterthe6-month(26-week)EvaluationPeriodandcontinued theinitialdoseof

LEV 1000mg/day or LEV 3000mg/day for the efficacy evaluation during 3 consecutive study periods, the EvaluationPeriod, the Maintenance Period, and the Follow-Up Period, unless a seizureoccurred.

In principle, the LEV dose had tobe unchanged to continue LEV monotherapy, unless a seizure occurred.If a seizure occurred, the LEV dosage was allowed to increaseusing the protocol-specified methods.

Prior toentering theFollow-UpPeriodatVisit 9,informed consentwasobtainedfor those subjects who agreed to continue participating in N01375. During the Follow-Up Period, the LEV dosage could be adjusted to the subject's best benefit at theinvestigator's discretionfrom a minimum of 1000mg/day toa maximum of 3000mg/day.The rateof increaseor decreasehad to be no faster than 1000mg/day per 2 weeks. Decreases in dosage and subsequent increases back to the previous dosagewere permitted asfrequently as the subjects needed to maintain the subject's safetywhilecontrollingseizures.

Duration of treatment: The total study duration by subject was up to 3.2 years and the study period included a 3-to 28-day ScreeningPeriod,4-week Up-TitrationPeriod (only for subjects in the LEV 3000mg/day group), 1-week Stabilization Period, 6-month (26-week) Evaluation Period, 6-month (26-week) Maintenance Period, Follow-Up Period (until approval of LEV monotherapy for POS in adults on 20 Feb 2015), and 6-week Withdrawal Period (included down-titration for 2 to 4 weeks and safety follow up for 2 weeks).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study population /Sample size

## Number of subjects(planned and analyzed):

Planned: 70 subjects in total to be enrolled

- 60 subjects in the LEV 1000 to 2000mg/day group
- 10 subjects in the LEV 3000mg/day group

Analyzed number: 71 subjects in total (included in Safety Set [Ss])

- 61 subjects in the LEV 1000 to 2000mg/day group
- 10 subjects in the LEV 3000mg/day group

Atotalof101subjectsprovidedinformedconsentandwerescreened.Atotalof71subjectswere eligibleto enterN01375andreceived atleast 1 LEV dose.

Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: Key inclusion criteria included the following:

- Subjectswith newly orrecently diagnosed epilepsyhaving experienced unprovoked partial onset seizures (POS) (IA, IB,IC) that were classifiable according to theInternational League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) 1981classification ofepileptic seizures
- Subjectswith at least 2 unprovoked seizures separated by a minimum of 48hours in theyear prior to registration, of which, at least 1 unprovoked seizure occurred in the 3 months prior to Visit 1

## Treatment

Oral tablets of LEV (250mg and 500mg) were used in this study. Subjects received 2 equal doses of the LEV oral tablets per day, 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Efficacy:Theprimary efficacyvariablewasseizurefreedomfor 6consecutivemonths (26weeks) of treatment followingstabilization during theEvaluationAnalysisPeriod at the final evaluated dosefor each subject in the LEV1000 to 2000mg/day group.The primary efficacy variable was calculated as the proportion of subjects who were seizure free for 6 months using theFull AnalysisSet (FAS).Theprimary efficacyresultwas consideredpositive if thelower limit of the exact confidence interval (CI) was greater than the predefined reference value of 40%. To verify the robustness of the results of the primary efficacy analysis, the primary variable wasanalyzedonthePerProtocolSet(PPS),whichincludedallsubjectsfrom theFASwithout anyimportantprotocoldeviationsthatmighthavehad animpactonthevalidityoftheefficacy data.

Thesecondary efficacyvariablesincluded seizurefreedomfor 6months(26weeks)intheLEV 3000mg/day group, seizure freedom for 1 year (52 weeks), time to the first seizure at the final evaluateddose,andtimetowithdrawal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety: Safety was assessed by collecting information on adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory results, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital sign measurements, and body weight.

## Statistical Methods

Statistical methods: This final CSR presents the analyses of all data from the study (including data from the first and second interim analyses).

During the course of the study, 3 study parts were defined:

- Part 1 included theUp-TitrationPeriod, Stabilization Period 1, EvaluationPeriod 1, StabilizationPeriod 2,EvaluationPeriod 2,andWithdrawal Period.Thefirstinterim data cut (17 Oct 2013) was performed when all subjects had the opportunity to complete the EvaluationPeriod on theirfinal evaluated dose; the data for analysis of the primary efficacy variablewereavailablefor allsubjects.
- Part 2included theMaintenancePeriod andWithdrawalPeriod.Atthetimeof thesecond interim data cut (17 Apr 2014), all subjects had the opportunity to complete the Maintenance Period.Theresults of thePart 2 data analyseswereconsideredfinal in thesecondinterim analyses(second datacut)
- Part 3included theFollow-UpPeriod andWithdrawal Period.

For theprimary efficacy variable,a statistical test was performed.The hypothesisHo:p=O.4 was to have been formally rejected in favor of H: p&gt;0.4, if the lower confidence limit for p was greater than 0.4. An accompanying exact p-value of the 2-sided statistical test at level of α=5% was calculated using the binomial distribution.

For categorical parameters, the number and percentage of subjects in each category were presented. For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics were presented (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, and maximum). For continuous efficacy parameters, descriptive statistics may have also included the 25th percentile (Q1) and the 75th percentile (Q3), depending on the distribution.

## Results

## Subject disposition

## Efficacy results

The analysis of theprimary efficacyvariable,6-monthseizurefreedomfor subjectsin theFull Analysis Set (FAS) in the LEV 1000 to 2000mg/day group was achieved by 73.8% of subjects, which resulted in a positive outcome as the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) (60.9%) was greater than the predefined value of 40% and the result was statistically significant (p-value&lt;0.ooo1). The supportive and sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy variable repeated using thePer Protocol Set (PPS) confirmed therobustness of thepositiveresults of the primary efficacy analysis on the FAS.

Twelve-month seizure freedom in the FAS in the LEV 1000 to 2000mg/day group was achieved by 59.0% of subjects and the exact 95% CI was 45.7% to 71.4%. In the analysis repeated using thePPS,12-monthseizurefreedomwasachieved by61.4%ofsubjects and theexact 95%CI was 47.6% to74.0%.

The efficacy of LEV monotherapy for up to 6 months and up to12 months was confirmed in subjects who received LEV doses ranging from 1000 to 2000mg/day.

Of the 9 subjects in the FAS in the LEV 3000mg/day group, 2 subjects (22.2%) achieved 6-monthseizurefreedom and 1 subject(11.1%) achieved 12-monthseizurefreedom.

Theefficacy of LEVmonotherapywas also observed duringtheFollow-UpPeriod in subjects who had the LEV dose escalated. Of the 14 subjects in the LEV 1000 to 2000mg/day group who seizure freedom after the LEV dose was increased to 3000mg/day.

Overall,efficacy of LEVmonotherapyfor thetreatment of POSatdosesrangingfrom1oo0 to 3000mg/daywas observed in this study.

## Safety results

During the overall study (Parts 1+2+3), the mean (SD) duration of exposure to LEV for all subjects was 735.7 (361.4) days (range: 14 to 1176 days). The mean (SD) duration of exposure to LEV for subjects in the LEV 1000 to 2000mg/day group was 783.2 (332.5) days (range: 31 to 1148 days) and for subjects in the LEV 3000mg/day group was 445.9 (412.3) days (range: 14 to 1176days).

During the overall study (Parts 1+2+3), a total of 68 subjects (95.8%) reported 638 TEAEs and 45 subjects (63.4%) reported 101 ADRs. A total of 7 subjects (9.9%) reported 11 TEAEs that led to discontinuation from the study and 10 subjects (14.1%) reported 20 serious TEAEs. A total of 7 subjects (9.9%) reported 11 severe TEAEs. A total of 7 subjects (9.9%) reported 7 TEAEs that required changes in the LEV dose. No deaths were reported during the study.

DuringParts 1 and 2, the mostfrequentlyrepoited TEAEwas nasopharyngitis(37subjects [52.1%]) followed by somnolence (25 subjects [35.2%]), malaise (8 subjects [11.3%]). dizziness (8 subjects [11.3%]), and headache (6 subjects [8.5%]). Other AE preferred terms (PTs) were reported in ≤5 subjects (7.0%) each

Duringtheoverallstudy（Parts1+2+3),theincidencesofthemostfrequentlyreportedTEAE PTsweresimilar tothosereported duringParts1and 2withtheexception ofnasopharvngitis. which was reported in 51 subjects (71.8%). Other firequently reported TEAE PTs were somnolence (26 subjects [36.6%], malaise (12 subjects [16.9%]). headache (11 subjects [15.5%]), diarrhoea (10 subjects [14.1%]), and dizziness (9 subjects [12.7%])

During the overall study (Parts 1+2+3), the most frequently reported ADR PT was somnolence (24 subjects [33.8%]). Other ADR PTs of malaise, inritability, dizziness, hypoaesthesia, and eczema were reported in ≤4 subjects (5.6%) each.

A total of 10 subjects (14.1%) reported 20 serious AEs (SAEs) during the overall study (Parts 1+2+3). A total of 6 subjects (8.5%) reported 12 SAEs during Parts 1 and 2. Four subjects (5.6%) reported 6 SAEs during Part 1; 3 subjects (6.5%) repoited 6 SAEs during Part 2; and 5 subjects (8.2%) reported 8 SAEs during Part 3. The SAEs were irritability, pyelonephritis, state, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, status epilepticus, agitation, anaphylactic reaction, syncope. cystitis, convulsion, and epilepsy (aggravated). All SAEs were judged as not related to LEV by the investigator, with the exception of irritability and postictal psychosis. All SAEs resolved.

During the overall study (Parts 1+2+3), a total of 7 subjects (9.9%) reported 11 TEAEs leading tostudydiscontinuation.Treatment-emergentAEsleadingtostudydiscontinuationwere reported in 7.0% of subjects who discontinued during Part 1, 4.3% of subjects who discontinued duringPart 2, and 1.6%of subjectswhodiscontinued duringPart 3.Of the 11 TEAEsleading to study discontinuation,5 events wereSAEs:irritability,postictal psychosis,suicide attempt, postictal state, and status epilepticus.The other 6 TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were agitation, vertigo positional, 2 events of somnolence, overdose (reported term: drug overdose of Nelurolen),andnausea.All eventswerejudged asrelated toLEVby the investigatorwith the exception of overdose,suicide attempt,postictal state, and status epilepticus.All TEAEs leading tostudydiscontinuationresolved.

Treatment-emergent AEs in the Psychiatric disorders system organ class (SOC) were given sDecial consideration and termed other significant TEAEs in this study. During the overall study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(Parts 1+2+3), a total of 10 subjects (14.1%) reported 18 TEAEs in thePsychiatric disorders SOC: 2 events each of agitation, depression,nightmare, suicide attempt, and alcohol withdrawal syndrome;and1eventeachofanxiety,postictalpsychosis,somatichallucination,stress, alcoholism, depressed mood, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and insomnia.. The incidenceofTEAEsinthePsychiatricdisordersSOCwas1subjecteachwiththeexception of depression andagitationthatwerereportedin2subjectseach.Nonewsafetyconcernswere noted.

Overall, there were no clinically relevant findings in clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and ECG findings. The majority of the post-Baseline possibly clinically significant (PCS) clinical laboratory values during each study part were reported at an incidence of&lt;8.7% of subjects with the exception of triglycerides toohigh (14.1% and 18.0%of subjects duringPait 1 and Part 3, respectively), bilirubin too high (10.9% and 11.5% of subjects during Part 2 and Part 3, respectively), and occult blood (20.3%, 15.6%, and 21.7% of subjects during Part 1, 5.6%ofsubjectsduringPart1,and triglycerides toohighwasreported in6.5%of subjects duringPart 2,overallpost-BaselinePCSclinicallaboratoryvaluesdidnotshowanyclinically relevant increases or decreases during the study.No specific trends inpost-BaselinePCSvalues werenoted.

Overall, the safety evaluation indicated that LEV monotherapy for up to 3.2years was safe and well tolerated in subjects with newly or recently diagnosed epilepsy.

## Paediatric subjects

All 6 subjects&lt;18 years old had TEAEs. Most TEAEs were mild in intensity a and resolved; the majority of TEAEs were considered not related to study medication (N01375 CSR Listing 7.2).

There were no deaths, SAEs,or discontinuations s due to AEs in subjects aged &lt;18 years.

## Conclusion

- The efficacy of monotherapy with LEV 1000mg/day to 2000mg/day in Japanese subjects aged ≥ 16 years with newly or recently diagnosed epilepsy was demonstrated by the measurements of 6-month and 12-month seizure freedom.
- The safety profile for LEV monotherapy was similar to the known data and appeared to be safe and well tolerated in subjects.

## 2. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Overall conclusion

Results from N01375 show efficacy of monotherapy with LEV 1000mg/day to 2000mg/day in Japanese subjects aged ≥ 16 years with newly or recently diagnosed epilepsy as measured by 6-month and 12month seizure freedom.

The evaluation of the safety data demonstrated that LEV was well tolerated. No new safety concerns were identified in this study.
