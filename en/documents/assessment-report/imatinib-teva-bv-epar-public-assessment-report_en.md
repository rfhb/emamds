## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Submission of the dossier

The applicant Teva B.V. submitted on 5 April 2017 an application for marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Imatinib Teva B.V., through the centralised procedure under Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 - 'Generic of a Centrally authorised product'. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 23 February 2017.

The application concerns a generic medicinal product as defined in Article 10(2)(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC and refers to a reference product, as defined in Article 10 (2)(a) of Directive 2001/83/EC, for which a marketing authorisation is or has been granted in in the Union on the basis of a complete dossier in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. The applicant applied for the following indication: Imatinib Teva B.V. is indicated for the treatment of  Paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl) positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) for whom bone marrow transplantation is not considered as the first line of treatment.  Paediatric patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, or in accelerated phase or blast crisis.  Adult patients with Ph+ CML in blast crisis.  Adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) integrated with chemotherapy.  Adult patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL as monotherapy.  Adult patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD) associated with platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) gene re-arrangements.  Adult patients with advanced hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL) with FIP1L1-PDGFRα rearrangement. The effect of imatinib on the outcome of bone marrow transplantation has not been determined. Imatinib Teva B.V. is indicated for  The treatment of adult patients with Kit (CD 117) positive unresectable and/or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST).  The adjuvant treatment of adult patients who are at significant risk of relapse following resection of Kit (CD117)-positive GIST. Patients who have a low or very low risk of recurrence should not receive adjuvant treatment.  The treatment of adult patients with unresectable dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and adult patients with recurrent and/or metastatic DFSP who are not eligible for surgery. In adult and paediatric patients, the effectiveness of imatinib is based on overall haematological and cytogenetic response rates and progression-free survival in CML, on haematological and cytogenetic response rates in Ph+ ALL, MDS/MPD, on haematological response rates in HES/CEL and on objective response rates in adult patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST and DFSP and on recurrence-free survival in adjuvant GIST. The experience with imatinib in patients with MDS/MPD associated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements is very limited (see section 5.1). There are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit or increased survival for these diseases. Medicinal product no longer authorise

Film-coated tablets:

 Paediatric patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, or in accelerated phase or blast crisis.  Adult patients with Ph+ CML in blast crisis.  Adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) integrated with chemotherapy.  Adult patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL as monotherapy.  Adult patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD) associated with platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) gene re-arrangements.  Adult patients with advanced hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL) with FIP1L1-PDGFRα rearrangement. The effect of imatinib on the outcome of bone marrow transplantation has not been determined. Imatinib Teva B.V. is indicated for  The treatment of adult patients with Kit (CD 117) positive unresectable and/or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST).  The adjuvant treatment of adult patients who are at significant risk of relapse following resection of Kit (CD117)-positive GIST. Patients who have a low or very low risk of recurrence should not receive adjuvant treatment.  The treatment of adult patients with unresectable dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and adult patients with recurrent and/or metastatic DFSP who are not eligible for surgery. In adult and paediatric patients, the effectiveness of imatinib is based on overall haematological and cytogenetic response rates and progression-free survival in CML, on haematological and cytogenetic response rates in Ph+ ALL, MDS/MPD, on haematological response rates in HES/CEL and on objective response rates in adult patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST and DFSP and on recurrence-free survival in adjuvant GIST. The experience with imatinib in patients with MDS/MPD associated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements is very limited (see section 5.1). There are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit or increased survival for these diseases. 2.2. Quality aspects 2.2.1.

Polymorphic form stability was investigated using active substance from both suppliers, as well as in tablets  following  formulation.  Samples  were  analysed  by  X-ray  powder  diffraction  (XRPD)  following storage  for  up  to  12  months  under  long  term  or  accelerated  conditions  (see  stability  section)  and

Film-coated tablets: Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development Imatinib  100  mg  film-coated  tablets  are  dark  yellow  to  brownish  orange  round  film-coated  tablets debossed with 'IT' and '1' divided by score line on one side. Each tablet contains 100 mg of imatinib in the form of the mesylate salt. Imatinib  film  coated  tablets  400  mg  are  dark  yellow  to  brownish  orange  oblong  film  coated  tablets debossed with 'IT' and '4' divided by score line on one side. Each tablet contains 400 mg of imatinib in the form of the mesylate salt. The formulation of imatinib film-coated tablets was designed to obtain a dosage form similar to the reference  product,  Glivec  400  mg  film-coated  tablets.  Disintegration  time  and  dissolution  were considered as most critical properties of the immediate release oral dosage form during the formulation development phase. The  commercial  manufacturing  process  comprises  granulation  followed  by  compression  and  filmcoating. Other than the film-coating mixture, all excipients used in the formulation are compendial, well-known and widely used in this type of dosage form and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. The Opadry  components  are  either  of  compendial  quality  (polyvinyl  alcohol,  titanium  dioxide,  talc, macrogol) or controlled by in-house specifications (colour agents). The  development  of  Imatinib  film  coated  tablets  100  mg  and  400  mg  was  initially  done  at  one manufacturing site but the process was transferred, during development, to a second manufacturing site which is the proposed commercial site. Bioequivalence was demonstrated between 400 mg tablets manufactured at the initial site with 400 mg reference product tablets. Given that the 100 mg tablets have the same qualitative and quantitative composition as 400 mg tablets, are produced by the same manufacturer, and have similar rapid in vitro dissolution profiles at pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8, a biowaiver of strengths  was  deemed  acceptable.  In  order  to  demonstrate  that  tablets  manufactured  at  the commercial site are equivalent to the biobatch, a series of in vitro dissolution studies was undertaken. The results showed  that dissolution profiles of the various tablets were similar across the physiologically-relevant pH range. The  QC  dissolution  method  was  developed  bearing  in  mind  the  high  solubility  of  imatinib  mesylate across  the  physiological  pH  range  (BCS  class  I).  After  significant  optimisation,  the  QC  dissolution method was shown not to have much discriminatory power in relation to meaningful changes in the manufacturing process. However, due to the high inherent solubility of the active substance, it was deemed to be a suitable method for QC purposes. Medicinal product no longer authorise

compared  to  the  diffractograms  taken  at  T0.  It  was  demonstrated  that  the  tablets  contain  and  no change in the solid state characteristics occur during storage under either condition.

Since the tablets contain score lines, a test of subdivision of tablets has been performed according to Ph. Eur. All results comply with the pharmacopoeial requirements.

The  primary  packaging  is  either  PVC/PE/PVdC/PE/PVC//Al  blisters  or  OPA/Al/PVC//Al  blisters.  The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. Manufacture of the product and process controls The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: granulation, homogenisation of the granules, compression, film-coating and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  at  full  scale  on  three  consecutive  batches  of  each strength.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. Product specification The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form including description (visual), identity (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), sub-division of tablets (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (HPLC), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), identity of colorants (colour test) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. Batch analysis results were provided for three production scale batches of each strength confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Stability of the product Stability  data  from  five  production  scale  batches  of  each  strength  of  finished  product  from  the commercial manufacturer stored for up to 9 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing. Two batches  of  each  strength  were  stored  in  PVC/PE/PVdC/PE/PVC//Al  blisters  and  three  were  stored  in OPA/Al/PVC//Al  blisters.  In  addition,  results  were  provided  from  two  pilot  scale  batches  of  each strength from the initial manufacturer stored in alu/alu blisters or HDPE bottles for up to 24 months under long term conditions and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions. Samples were tested for  assay,  related  substances,  dissolution,  loss  on  drying,  description  and  microbial  limits.  The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No significant changes were observed to any of the measured parameters in any of the studies indicating that the product is stable. Medicinal product no longer authorise

Freeze-testing was also performed at -20  o C which had no impact on the quality of the product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years without special storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable.

## Adventitious agents

No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

A  series  of in  vitro dissolution  studies  in  0.1  M  HCl,  pH  4.5  and  pH  6.8  was  conducted  in  order  to demonstrate the similarity  in  dissolution  rate  between  the  capsules  and  the  reference  product.  The dissolution  profiles  of  Glivec  400  mg  tablets  were  compared  with  the  biobatch  400  mg  capsules.  A comparison  between  Imatinib  Teva  100  and  400  mg  capsules  was  also  performed.  Glivec  100  mg capsules  were  compared  with  Imatinib  Teva  100  mg  capsules.  Finally,  Glivec  100  mg  tablets  were compared with Imatinib Teva 100 mg capsules. In all tested dissolution media for each dosage form, rapid and complete dissolution (&gt; 85% in 15 minutes) was observed indicating that they have similar dissolution rates.

Hard capsules: Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development Imatinib  capsules  100  mg  are  non-transparent orange  capsules  with  '7629' printed  in  black  on  the capsule body and 'TEVA' on the cap. The content of the capsule is a white to light yellow granulated powder. Each capsule contains 100 mg of imatinib as the mesylate salt. Imatinib  capsules  400  mg  are  non-transparent orange  capsules  with  '7630' printed  in  black  on  the capsule body and 'TEVA' on the cap. The content of the capsule is a white to light yellow granulated powder. Each capsule contains 400 mg of imatinib as the mesylate salt. The formulation development phase was conducted to obtain a formulation that would use standard technology,  standard  excipients  and  would  allow  rapid  drug  release  similar  to  that  of  the  reference product, Glivec. Excipients  used  in  the  formulation  are  all  compendial,  well-known  or  widely  used  for  this  type  of dosage  form.  Their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur.  or  in-house  standards.  There  are  no  novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. Appropriate  excipients  in  optimal  quantity  in  the  formulation  were  selected  in  order  to  match  the dissolution  profiles  of  drug  reference  product.  Pre-formulation  studies  were  performed  to  test  and determine  compatibility  of  the  proposed  excipients  with  the  active  substance.  The  manufacturing process was developed in order to deliver a final product of satisfactory stability. The scale up of the process was achieved by defining optimal process parameters and ranges. Bioequivalence was established clinically between 400 mg capsules and the reference product, Glivec 400 mg film-coated tablets. Dissolution studies were performed in order to demonstrate in vitro equivalence between the reference product and imatinib capsules with regard to imatinib release from the product. The discriminatory nature of the method was evaluated. Only minimal differences in dissolution profiles of different formulations were observed. Such behaviour was expected due to very high solubility of drug substance (&gt; 300 mg/ml), which dissolves rapidly after capsule opening. Since the formulation contains a high amount of active substance, dissolution is not influenced by the excipients. Therefore, dissolution is not a critical quality parameter for this product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since  all  requirements  for  a  biowaiver  of  strengths  are  in  place  for  the  100  mg  capsule  (same qualitative  and  quantitative  composition  as  400  mg  capsules,  produced  by  the  same  manufacturer, similar rapid in vitro dissolution profiles), no clinical bioavailability study was required.

The primary packaging is PVC/PE/PVdC/PE/PVC//Al blisters and OPA/Al/PVC//Al blisters. The materials comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

Samples  were  tested  for  assay,  related  substances,  dissolution,  water  content,  description  and microbial limits. The assay and impurity methods were changed during stability studies and a method comparison  report  demonstrates  that  the  new  method  is  a  suitable  replacement.  The  analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No significant changes to any of the measured parameters were observed under either storage condition and in either packaging format were observed indicating that the capsules are stable.

Manufacture of the product and process controls The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  seven  main  steps:  mixing  of  intra-granular  excipients,  roller compaction, screening, milling, homogenisation, encapsulation and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. The  manufacturing  processes  have  been  adequately  described  and  the  critical  steps  have  been identified. The different steps of the manufacturing processes are described, together with equipment type and operating parameters. The validation protocol has been provided which describes how the commercial process will be validated in production scale before commercialisation. The quality of the production batches will be evaluated by in process testing as well as the results of finished product testing. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. Product specification The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form including description of capsules and their contents (visual), water content (KF), identity (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), dissolution (HPLC) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. Batch analysis results are provided for three production scale batches of each strength of capsule confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Stability of the product Stability data from six production scale batches of each strength of imatinib capsule stored for up to 12 months  under  long  term  conditions  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and three batches of each strength were packed in each of primary packaging formats proposed for marketing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Freeze-testing was also performed at -20  o C. In addition, one batch per strength was exposed to light as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on  Photostability  Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products. Neither freezing nor exposure to light under the conditions investigated has any negative impact on the quality of the product.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months stored below 30  o C as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable.

No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of Imatinib Teva BV manufactured by Teva is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all imatinib containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased.

Adventitious agents Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the gelatine used in the manufacture is provided. No excipients derived from human origin have been used. 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 2.2.6. Recommendations for future quality development Not applicable. 2.3. Non-clinical aspects 2.3.1. Introduction A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 2.3.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment Medicinal product no longer authorise

## 2.3.3. Discussion  and Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.

To support the marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted two bioequivalence studies under  fed  conditions.    Both  BE  studies  were  a  Single-Dose  Randomized,  Open-Label,  Two-Way Crossover, Comparative Bioavailability Study in Normal, Healthy Subjects under Fed Conditions.

This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional non clinical studies were not considered necessary. 2.4. Clinical aspects 2.4.1. Introduction This  is  an  application  for  film-coated  tablets  and  hard  capsules  containing  imatinib.  The  applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as efficacy and  safety  of  imatinib  based  on  published  literature.  The  SmPC  is  in  line  with  the  SmPC  of  the reference product with the exception of the information related to the indications protected by market exclusivity at the time of the Marketing authorisation application. No  formal  scientific  advice  by  the  CHMP  was  given  for  this  medicinal  product.  For  the  clinical assessment  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioequivalence  CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.1)  in  its current version is of particular relevance. GCP The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. Exemption A waiver of two proportional strengths has been applied for based on dissolution profiles. The different film-coated tablets and hard capsules strengths are manufactured with the same process by the same manufacturer. They have the same qualitative composition and a proportional quantitative composition. The evidence submitted to show that in vitro dissolution profiles are similar is enough in the CHMP's opinion to grant a biowaiver for the proportional formulation of lower strength since the necessary information has been provided. Based  on  the  submitted  bioequivalence  studies,  study  1  (film  coated  tablets)  and  study  2  (hard capsules) both meet the bioequivalence criteria with respect to the rate and extent of absorption of Imatinib as set in the Protocol.

CoA for reference product has been submitted.

Populations studied Study 1 (film-coated tablets) Of the forty-two (42) healthy male subjects who were included in the study, forty-one (41) subjects completed the crossover design and received a single oral dose of the assigned formulation on day 1 and day 15. One patient withdrew consent before dosing of period 2 due to an adverse event (toothache of severe intensity) and received only one single oral dose of the Glivec 400 mg Film-Coated Tablet. Samples collected in period 1 for this subject were analysed but excluded from the statistical analysis. Forty-two (42) subjects were analysed and forty-one (41) were included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. Study 2 (hard capsules) Of  the  twenty  (20)  healthy  male  and  female  subjects  who  were  included  in  the  study,  twenty  (20) subjects completed the crossover design and received a single oral dose of the assigned formulation on day 1 and day 14. All subjects were analyzed and were included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. Analytical methods Study 1 (film-coated tablets) Pre-study validation The  analytical  method  validation  report  describes  the  method  validation  for  the  determination  of Imatinib and N-Desmethyl Imatinib in human plasma using K2EDTA as anticoagulant. Back-calculated concentrations  were  determined  for  Imatinib  using  least  squares  regression  analysis  employing  a weighted  (1/x)  quadratic  regression  (y=ax²+bx+c).  The  compounds  were  identified  and  quantified using reverse-phase HPLC with MS/MS detection over a theoretical concentration range of 10.0 ng/mL to 4000.0 ng/mL for Imatinib and 5.00 ng/mL to 400.00 ng/mL for N-Desmethyl Imatinib. The analytes have no chiral centres and therefore no enantiomers for these compounds exist. The concomitant medications were tested and met SOP acceptance criteria as all samples were free of interference. In-study validation Bioanalitycal report dated July 19th, 2010 describes the analysis of Imatinib in human K2EDTA plasma over the concentration range of 10.0 ng/mL to 4000.0 ng/mL (Weighting Factor 1/c) using Imatinib-d8 as IS Medicinal product no longer authorise

The  in-study  validation  shows  an  acceptable  calibration  standards  (In  all  runs,  there  were  5 calibrations  standards  out  of  the  acceptance  range  and  only  2  standards  were  rejected  in  one calibration curve) and QC values.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The reasons for reanalysis of samples are acceptable for unacceptable internal standard response.

Dilution samples were not necessary.

The study samples were analysed, with a calibration curve, and four sets of non-zero QCs in duplicate (8  QCs).  Since  study  samples  from  three  subjects  (120  samples)  were  analysed  in  each  run,  the number of QCs samples relative to the number of study samples is adequate.

Incurred Sample Reproducibility was acceptable. The mainly samples reintegration correspond to Period 1 and 2; hour 1.0. and it was not carried out for subject No. 010 and 018 with Cmax at 1.0. As, Imatinib Cmax achieved within 2-4 hours post-dose the samples reintegration is acceptable. The chromatogram integration SOP was submitted. The long term stability data in frozen human plasma stored at  -20 ºC was 44 days to cover the 35 days maximum storage samples at -20 ºC Study 2 (hard capsules) Pre-study validation The analytes have no chiral centers and therefore no enantiomers for these compounds exist. The  analytical  method  validation  report  describes  the  method  for  the  determination  of  Imatinib  in human plasma using K2EDTA as anticoagulant. This validation report provides the results pertaining to selectivity, matrix effect, hemolyzed  and  lipemic  plasma  experiments,  specificity  (concomitant medication  and  hormonal  contraceptives  interference),  injection  carryover,  recovery,  within  and between batch precision and accuracy, dilution integrity, linearity, evaluation of Imatinib in presence of Desmethyl Imatinib and stability. The compounds were identified and quantified using reverse-phase HPLC with MS/MS detection over a theoretical concentration range of 10.0 ng/mL to 5000.0 ng/mL for Imatinib. A quadratic equation (y = ax2 + bx + c) was used to evaluate Imatinib standard concentrations. All calibration  points  are  weighted  by  the  factor  1/c.  Back-calculated  standard  concentrations  from  the independent calibration curves are provided. The concomitant medications were tested and met SOP acceptance criteria as all samples were free of interference. In-study validation Bioanalitycal  report  dated  March  10th,  2011  describes  the  analysis  of  Imatinib  in  human  K2EDTA plasma  over  the  concentration  range  of  10.0  ng/mL  to  5000.0  ng/mL  (weighting  factor  1/x)  using Imatinib-d4 as IS. The  in-study  validation  shows  an  acceptable  calibration  standards  and  QC  values.  All  calibrations standards and QCs were within acceptance range. The  study  samples  were  analysed,  with  a  calibration  curve,  and  four  sets  of  non-zero  QCs  in quadruplicate (16 QCs). Since study samples from four subjects (184 samples) were analysed in each run, the number of QCs samples relative to the number of study samples is adequate. The reasons for reanalysis of samples are acceptable for unacceptable internal standard response and extraction error. Medicinal product no longer authorise

Dilution samples were not necessary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Incurred Sample Reproducibility was acceptable.

The long term stability data in frozen human plasma stored at -25 ºC ± 10 ºC was 1008 days to cover the 24 days maximum storage samples at -25 ºC ± 10 ºC.

## Pharmacokinetic variables

For both studies, the main pharmacokinetic parameters of interest for this study will be Cmax and AUC072.  Other  parameters  such  as  Tmax,  AUC∞,  AUC0-72/∞,  Kel  and  T½el  were  provided  for  information purposes  only.  The  natural  logarithmic  transformation  of  Cmax,  AUC0-72  and  AUC∞  was  used  for  all statistical inference. The pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using Kinetic Version 9.01. The main absorption and disposition parameters were estimated using a non-compartmental approach with a log-linear terminal phase assumption. The trapezoidal rule was used to estimate the area under the  curve  and  the  terminal  phase  were  estimated  by  maximizing  the  coefficient  of  determination estimated  from  the  log-linear  regression  model.  However,  they  were  not  estimated  for  individual concentration-time profiles where the terminal log-linear phase cannot be reliably characterized. Statistical methods For both studies, the statistical analysis was applied to quality assured data from all subjects in the final  dataset, with unbalanced groups if necessary. The PROC GLM procedure  from SAS® was used. Concentration-time profiles where subjects exhibit pre-dose levels higher than 5%  of the corresponding Cmax would be excluded from the statistical analysis. Concentration-time profiles where subjects exhibit non-zero predose levels equal to or less than 5% of the corresponding Cmax will be included in the statistical analysis without baseline correction. Analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  was  applied  to  log-transformed  AUCt  and  Cmax  parameters.  The significance of the sequence, period, treatment, and subject-within-sequence effects was tested. Using  the  same  statistical  model,  the  least-squares-means,  the  differences  between  the  treatments least-squares-means,  and  the  corresponding  standard  errors  of  these  differences  was  estimated  for log-transformed  AUCt  and  Cmax  parameters.  Based  on  these  statistics,  the  ratios  of  the  geometric means for treatments and the corresponding 90% confidence intervals were calculated. Based  on the log-transformed parameters, the following criteria were  used to evaluate the bioequivalence between the test and reference products: The 90% confidence intervals of the relative mean AUCt and Cmax of the test to reference products should be between 80.00% and 125.00%.

The results of the bioequivalence studies with the 400 mg formulation can be extrapolated to the 100 mg strengths (film-coated and hard capsules)

Based on the statistical  analysis  the  test  product  is  equivalent  to  the  reference  with  respect  to  the extent and rate of absorption / exposure. The 90% confidence intervals calculated for AUC(0-72) and Cmax of Imatinib were inside the normal range of acceptability (0.80-1.25). Also the 90% CI for AUC(0inf) was calculated and were also inside the normal range (0.80-1.25). A biowaiver applies for the 100 mg dose strength. Study 2 Table 3. Comparison of Results with Standards for Bioequivalence Based on the statistical  analysis  the  test  product  is  equivalent  to  the  reference  with  respect  to  the extent and rate of absorption/exposure. The 90% confidence intervals calculated for AUC(0-72) and Cmax of Imatinib were inside the normal range of acceptability (80.00 - 125.00). Safety data The safety profile of both products seems to be comparable although it is obvious that the design was not powered to compare the safety profile. No difference in the safety profile is anticipated. Conclusions Based on the submitted bioequivalence studies, both meet the bioequivalence criteria with respect to the rate and extent of absorption of Imatinib. Medicinal product no longer authorise

## Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.7. Product information 2.7.1. User consultation A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: The applicant submitted a duplicate application of the product Imatinib Teva. Since a successfully user consultation for Imatinib Teva was performed it is considered an acceptable justification for not performing user consultation for Imatinib Teva B.V. 3. Benefit-risk balance This application concerns a duplicate version of imatinib Teva film-coated tablets and hard capsules (EMEA/H/C/002585). The reference product is Glivec. No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant's clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. The bioequivalence studies form the pivotal basis with a single centre, randomized, single dose, laboratory-blinded, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover design for the film-coated tablets bioequivalence study and an open-label, single-dose, randomized, two-period, two-sequence, two-treatment, crossover design for the hard capsules bioequivalence study. The studies design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. The test formulation of Imatinib Teva BV met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with Glivec. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0- , and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## 4. Recommendation

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP is of the opinion that Imatinib Teva B.V. is not similar to Tasigna (nilotinib), Bosulif (bosutinib), Iclusig (ponatinib), Xaluprine (6-mercaptopurine monohydrate), Atriance (nelaranibe), Blincyto (blinatumomab), Vidaza (azacitidine), Revlimid (lenalidomide) and Besponsa (inotuzumab ozogamicin)

within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1 Outcome Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Imatinib Teva B.V. is favourable in the following indication: Imatinib Teva B.V. is indicated for the treatment of  Paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl) positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) for whom bone marrow transplantation is not considered as the first line of treatment.  Paediatric patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, or in accelerated phase or blast crisis.  Adult patients with Ph+ CML in blast crisis.  Adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) integrated with chemotherapy.  Adult patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL as monotherapy.  Adult patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD) associated with platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) gene re-arrangements.  Adult patients with advanced hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL) with FIP1L1-PDGFRα rearrangement. The effect of imatinib on the outcome of bone marrow transplantation has not been determined. Imatinib Teva B.V. is indicated for  The treatment of adult patients with Kit (CD 117) positive unresectable and/or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST).  The adjuvant treatment of adult patients who are at significant risk of relapse following resection of Kit (CD117)-positive GIST. Patients who have a low or very low risk of recurrence should not receive adjuvant treatment.  The treatment of adult patients with unresectable dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and adult patients with recurrent and/or metastatic DFSP who are not eligible for surgery. In adult and paediatric patients, the effectiveness of imatinib is based on overall haematological and cytogenetic response rates and progression-free survival in CML, on haematological and cytogenetic response rates in Ph+ ALL, MDS/MPD, on haematological response rates in HES/CEL and on objective response rates in adult patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST and DFSP and on recurrence-free survival in adjuvant GIST. The experience with imatinib in patients with MDS/MPD associated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements is very limited (see section 5.1). There are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit or increased survival for these diseases. Medicinal product no longer authorise
