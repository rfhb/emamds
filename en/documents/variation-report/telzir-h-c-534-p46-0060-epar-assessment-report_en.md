## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, the applicant has submitted the final study report (week 168) for paediatric study APV20003. This study explored the use of Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir once daily in paediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years.

Since the once-daily regimen of Telzir is not approved in UE and since the applicant is not willing to seek authorisation for such a regimen, the data derived from study APV20003 are regarded as simply informative.

Of note, the 48-week study report of study APV20003 was already assessed by the CHMP in the setting of the Telzir II18 variation.

## II. RECOMMENDATION

Based on the submitted data, no further regulatory action is required.

This procedure is considered fulfilled.

## III. INTRODUCTION

The MAH  has submitted the final paediatric study report of study  APV20003 for Telzir (fosamprenavir),  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  amended,  on medicinal products for paediatric use. The study has not been conducted in accordance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study do(es) not influence the benefit risk for Telzir and that there is no consequential regulatory action.

Telzir in combination with low dose ritonavir is indicated for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) infected adults, adolescents and children of 6 years and above in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products.

Telzir oral suspension is the recommended option for the most accurate dosing in children based on body weight.

In paediatric patients, the oral suspension should be taken with food in order to aid palatability and assist compliance.

The recommended dose is 18 mg/kg of fosamprenavir (0.36 ml/kg) twice daily [maximum of 700 mg or 14 ml] together with 3 mg/kg of ritonavir twice daily .

The adult dose of Telzir tablet 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily may be used in children weighing at least 39 kg and able to swallow tablets.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Study APV20003 was aimed to explore the FPV/RTV once daily regimen in paediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years. The FPV/RTV QD regimen is currently not approved in the UE and the applicant does not intend  to  seek  authorisation  for  a  QD  regimen  of  FPV/RTV.  Therefore,  the  data  derived  from  study APV20003 are regarded as simply informative. Moreover, the 48-week results of study APV20003 were already assessed by the CHMP in the setting of Telzir II18 variation for the extension of indication of Telzir to paediatric patients.

## IV. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## IV.1 Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Telzir tablets and oral suspension were used in the APV20003 study.

## IV.2 Clinical aspects

## 1. Introduction

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As a reminder, to support the extension of indication of Telzir to paediatric patients (Telzir II18), the applicant submitted the reports for two ongoing studies:

Study APV29005 (which was regarded as pivotal) evaluating the FPV BID regimen in PI-naïve patients aged 2 to &lt;6 years old and the FPV/RTV BID regimen in PI-naïve and PI-experienced patients 2 to 18 years old. The report for week 24 data was submitted.

Study  APV20003 (which  was  regarded  as  supportive)  evaluating  the FPV/RTV QD regimens  in  PInaïve and PI-experienced patients aged 2 to 18 years old. After a protocol amendment, PI-experienced patients  were  allowed  to  switch  to  a FPV/RTV  BID regimen.  The  report  for  week  48  data  was submitted.

In both studies APV29005 and APV20003, subjects that successfully completed 48 weeks of therapy will continue to receive FPV until approved for use in paediatrics and local supplies are available.

Moreover,  the  safety,  tolerability,  pharmacokinetics,  and  antiviral  activity  of  FPV  ±  RTV  dosing  in paediatric subjects 6 weeks to &lt;2 years of age is being studied in protocol APV20002.

Whereas the final study report for study APV20003 has just been submitted, the final study report for studies APV290005 and APV20002 are planned to be submitted by Q1 2014 (see table below).

38 centers in North America and Europe: 13 in the United States, 9 in Spain, 8 in Italy, 3 in Portugal, 2 in Canada, 2 in Romania, and 1 in Netherlands.

Initiation Date: 12-Jul-2002

Completion Date: 14-Oct-2008

Date of Report: April 2009

## Primary

-  To  evaluate  the safety  and  tolerability  of  FPV/RTV  given  once  daily in combination with NRTI therapy for 48 weeks in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve and experienced, paediatric subjects 2 to ≤ 18 years of age
-  To  characterize plasma APV PK following administration of FPV/RTV once daily and twice daily to paediatric subjects 2 to ≤ 18 years of age
- To assess whether FPV has systemic exposure when administered to HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects 2 to ≤18 years of age
- To characterize plasma RTV PK following administration of FPV/RTV once daily and BID to pediatric subjects 2 to ≤18 years of age
- To investigate the relationship of plasma APV PK to changes in plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations, CD4+ cell counts and to the occurrence of adverse events (Aes)
- To assess viral resistance patterns and to compare these patterns with treatment outcome
- To assess subject adherence, shaking of FPV oral suspension, and parent/guardian perceptions of study medications
-  To  evaluate  the antiviral  activity  and  immunologic  activity  of  FPV/RTV administered once daily in combination with NRTI therapy for 48 weeks in HIV-1 infected, ART-naïve and experienced, paediatric subjects 2 to ≤ 18 years of age
-  To  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability,  antiviral  activity,  immunologic  response  and adherence of subjects who switch to a FPV/RTV BID regimen after initially receiving a FPV/RTV QD regimen

Subjects  were  either  ART-naïve  or  ART-experienced,  aged  2  to  ≤  18  years  with screening HIV-1 RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL.

A total of 69 subjects were enrolled and received FPV/RTV once daily, 10 of whom switched to receive FPV/RTV on a BID basis during the study.

| Efficacy analyses | - Subjects receiving FPV/RTV 1400/200mg QD were switched to the standard adult dosage regimen of FPV/RTV 700/100mg BID. For endpoints using continuous viral load and CD4+ cell count data, the 'observed' analysis was used in which all non-missing data up to a visit was used to calculate the summary data for that particular visit. This method was used for the analysis of changes from baseline. For proportions, endpoint using viral load data a time to loss of virologic response (TLOVR) analysis was used. For this analysis, positive responders were those who had a confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA response <400 copies/mL below baseline prior to the visit of interest, but without having experienced treatment failure. Treatment failure was defined as the first of the following events: confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA above 400 copies/mL, permanent discontinuation of study drug or Medicinal product |

tolerability following administration of FPV/RTV once daily. Of these 62 subjects, 38 were planned to enrol in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 and have a PK profile at Week 4 in order to obtain full PK profiles from 26 evaluable subjects. Based on plasma APV PK data  from  previous  FPV  studies,  the  highest  variability  was  observed  for  the  FPV suspension  formulation  in  APV10008,  where  the  inter-subject  standard  deviation (SD) of loge(AUC) was 0.42. Assuming this inter-subject SD, based on a two-side procedure with α=0.5 on log scale, and a sample size of 26 subjects, the width of the 95% confidence interval  (CI)  for  plasma  APV  area  under  the  concentration  versus time  curve  during  a  dosing  interval  (AUC(0-τ))  would  be  34%  around  the  point estimate (geometric mean).

The response rates varied across the groups by age and by PI experience (see table below). When considering  antiviral  response  by  age  and  the  cohort  sample  sizes,  the  differences  in  baseline resistance  profile  and  treatment  experience  should  be  taken  into  account  as  previously  explored  in Week 48 analysis report for APV20003. Indeed, a greater proportion of subjects in the 12 to 18 year group had &gt;3 reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations (43%) when compared to the other cohorts (23% and 13% for 2 to 5 and 6 to 11 year age groups, respectively).

The 2 to 5 years of age group consistently demonstrates the greatest response to FPV/RTV regimen.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rapporteur's comment:

This trend of a lower rate of responders in the older children was already underlined by the Rapporteur during the assessment of the 48-week data and was related to the accumulation of resistance with longer treatment exposure.

## Antiviral response by gender and by race

No apparent differences in antiviral response for race or gender were observed, although the number of subjects in each subgroup was small.

## Safety results

## Treatment emergent AEs

## Adverse Events Regardless of Causality

Ninety-six percent (66/69) of subjects reported at least one AE. The most common AEs were vomiting (41%), diarrhea (26%), headache (26%), upper respiratory tract infection (25%), nausea (23%), and cough (23%).

There were no apparent differences in overall AE frequency for age group, gender or race at entry.

This  overall  AE  pattern  is  similar  to  that  reported  in  the  Week  48  report  (cut-off  date  16  February 2005).

Rash was reported in 23% of subjects, and described under a variety of terms. The majority of these treatment emergent rash AEs were of Grade 1 intensity.

## Treatment Emergent Adverse Events Attributable to Study Drug

Fifty-seven percent (57%, 39/69) of subjects reported at least one drug-related AE. The most common drug-related  AEs  reported  were  vomiting  (26%,  18/69),  nausea  (20%,  14/69),  and  diarrhea  (12%, 8/69).

Subjects in the 6 to 11 year old age group reported fewer drug-related AEs (29%, 5/17) than subjects in  the  2  to  5  year  old  (71%,  12/17)  or  12  to  18  year  old  (63%,  22/35)  age  groups,  although  the numbers in each group are small. This is a similar pattern to that described in the Week 48 report.

## Serious AEs

There were no fatal events reported in this study.

SAEs occurring in more than one subject were drug hypersensitivity (4%, 3/69), measles (3%, 2/69) and pyrexia (3%, 2/69).

Four  of  the  SAEs  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  drug-related  comprising  blood  alkaline phosphatase increased, Benign salivary gland neoplasm, hemoptysis and hyperglycemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## AEs leading to discontinuation

Twelve subjects (17%, 12/69) (2 to 5 years: n=3; 6 to 11 years: n=2, 12 to 18 years: n=7) reported an AE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug and withdrawal from the study. Of these 12, two are new withdrawals since the Week 48 report. Events included vomiting (3), nausea (3), stomach discomfort  (1),  hyperglycemia  (1),  hypertriglyceridemia  (1),  Hodgkin's  disease  (1),  elevated  blood alkaline phosphatase (1), elevated eosinophil count (1) and hemoptysis (1).

## Clinical laboratory evaluations

Overall, the incidence of treatment-emergent Grade 3-4 clinical chemistry laboratory abnormalities was low (9%, 6/66), and represented increases in liver transaminases and triglycerides

Overall,  there  were  median  increases  in  triglycerides,  total  cholesterol,  HDL  and  LDL  through  Week 168. Of these parameters, only one subject experienced a Grade 3 laboratory abnormality of elevated triglycerides.

## Rapporteur's comment:

## No new safety signals have emerged since the Week 48 report

## Pharmacokinetic results

The PK results were assessed in the setting of Telzir II-18 variation and will not be detailed in the present report.

In the Telzir II-18 AR, it was concluded that:

-  When  children  2-12  years  old  were  treated  with  30/6  mg/kg  FPV/RTV  QD,  underdosing  of approximately 30% occurred.

-  For  adolescents  treated  with  1400/200  mg  single  tablet  dose,  similar  AUCs  were  achieved  as  the adult reference population but Ctrough were 30% lower than in adults (the sample size was limited to 3 patients).

## Viral genotyping and phenotyping results

Post-Week 48 genotypes are available for twelve subjects and post-Week 48 phenotypes are available for eleven subjects.

## Mutations in Reverse Transcriptase

Twelve subjects have genotypes post-Week 48 available.

Of these 12 subjects, three have post-Week 48 RT genotypes identical to what was observed at Week 48.

Phenotypic analysis for amprenavir

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Eleven subjects have APV phenotypes post-Week 48 available.

Of these eleven subjects, only subjects and had APV FC above the clinical cut-off for APV (cut-off FC = 4).

Subject had primary PRO resistance mutations I54L and L33F; Subject had primary PRO resistance mutations I54L, I84V, L33F and V32I. Neither subject was PI-experienced prior to entering the study and these mutations were not present in either subject at Day 1.

## Relationship of genotypic and phenotypic results to virologic response

Eight  of  the  12  subjects  had  NRTI  associated  resistance  mutations  post  Week  48  and  all  twelve subjects  had  PRO  mutations  post  Week  48.  Two  of  these  12  subjects  never  achieved  virologic suppression by Week 48; the remaining subjects exhibited plasma HIV-1 RNA rebound. Change from baseline varied from +0.09 (Subject at Week 204) to -2.48 (subject at Week 60) log10 copies/mL HIV1 RNA.

Of the eleven subjects with APV phenotypes post Week 48, only subjects and had APV FC above the clinical cut-off for APV. Subject had APV FC and d4T FC above the cut-off at week 96. This subject had 3.96 log10 copies/mL HIV-1 RNA at Week 96 (-1.02 log10 copies/mL change from baseline). Subject had APV, ABC, 3TC, ddI and d4T FCs above the cut-offs for each individual drug at Week 252. This subject  had  3.46  log10  copies/mL  HIV-1  RNA  at  Week  252  (-1.12  log10  copies/mL  change  from baseline).

As previously observed in adult patients, the once daily regimen of FPV/RTV is not optimal to achieve virologic suppression in paediatric patients.

Rapporteur's comment: There is no relevant finding regarding the emergence of genotypic/phenotypic resistance. 3. Discussion on clinical aspects The  applicant  discussed  the  results  from  study  APV20003  in  view  of  those  derived  from  other paediatric studies. Twice daily  LPV/RTV fixed dose combination liquid formulation was examined in 100 ART-naïve and experienced subjects (aged 6 months to 12 years) in combination with 2 NRTIs. At Week 48, 84% (37/44) of the ART naïve subjects and 75% (42/56) of ART-experienced subjects had HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/mL (ITT M=F) with a response rate of 58% in the 24 PI-experienced children [Saez-Llorens et al, Pediatric Infect Dis J 2003; 22:216-23.]. The poor performance of FPV/RTV in this study over 168 Weeks may be partially attributable to the up front use of FPV/RTV once daily in this population, as this regimen has been shown to be inferior to LPV/RTV in treatment experienced adults in APV30003. Of note, higher treatment response rates were seen when FPV/RTV was given twice daily in APV29005: 70% (19/27) of PI-naïve and 57% (17/30) of PI-experienced subjects were responders by TLOVR (&lt;400 copies/mL) through 24 Weeks in that study. Given the higher antiviral response rates seen with FPV/RTV in APV29005, FPV/RTV given twice daily is currently recommended for children aged 6 and above.

## V. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

##  Overall conclusion

Telzir in combination with low dose ritonavir is currently indicated children from  6 years of age as a BID regimen as for adult patients.

Study APV20003 was aimed to explore the FPV/RTV once daily regimen in paediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years. The FPV/RTV QD regimen is currently not approved in the UE and the applicant does not intend  to  seek  authorisation  for  a  QD  regimen  of  FPV/RTV.  Therefore,  the  data  derived  from  study APV20003 are regarded as simply informative.

The 48-week results of study APV20003 were already assessed by the CHMP in the setting of Telzir II18  variation  for  the  extension  of  indication  of  Telzir  to  paediatric  patients  and  the  168-week  data currently submitted did not reveal any new relevant finding as regards efficacy or safety.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As a matter of fact, the results of this study were hampered by a very high rate of discontinuation (77%). Overall,  this  study  in  paediatric  patients  to  some  extent  reinforces  the  previous  assertion derived from adult patients that the once daily regimen of fosamprenavir/ritonavir is not optimal to achieve virologic suppression.

Additional data on the use of FPV/RTV in paediatric patients are awaited from studies APV20002 (for patients aged 6 weeks to &lt;2 years of age) and APV29005 (for patients aged 2 to 18 years).

In  this  setting,  the  Rapporteur  would  like  to  be  updated  by  the  applicant  on  the  planned  dates  of submission  for  these  both  studies.  Indeed, whereas the 24-week report for study APV290005 was submitted by Q4 2006, the 48-week final study report is only planned to be submitted by Q1 2014. The Rapporteur would like the applicant to discuss the reasons for such a long period between both submissions. All the more that additional data for paediatric patients derived from both studies are awaited for 31 December 2009 according to the letter of undertakings dated 19 July 2007.

The applicant could provide his response to this request by a separate letter.
